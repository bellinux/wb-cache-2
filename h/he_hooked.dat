5|$|On July 27, 2015, Robinson {{signed a}} three-year {{deal with the}} Indiana Pacers. Pacer General Manager Larry Bird noted {{that he had been}} {{attempting}} to acquire Robinson for some time due to the potential that he saw. <b>He</b> <b>hooked</b> Robinson up with shooting guru Hal Wissel for extra attention during his first offseason. Robinson entered the season impaired by shoulder soreness and did not dress for the October 28 season opener. Robinson began practicing with the team at the beginning of November as he recovered from his shoulder injury.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he resumed}} with Victoria, but faced {{a lot of}} {{competition}} for a place as an opening batsman in the Australian team. He played his only Test in the 1946-47 Ashes series at the Adelaide Oval, filling in for the injured Sid Barnes. Scoring 12 and 31, he partnered Arthur Morris in a second innings opening stand of 116. After a further two first-class seasons, Harvey retired after being dropped from Victoria's first-choice team. He ended with a record of 1,147 first-class runs at 38.23 in 22 matches. This included three centuries, and he captained Victoria five times, winning one matchthe rest were drawn. His career highlight was an innings of 136 in December 1946 against New South Wales, when <b>he</b> <b>hooked</b> a bouncer from Ray Lindwall into the MCG public bar and featured in a partnership of 271 with Keith Miller. His highest score was 163 against South Australia at Adelaide. Harvey continued playing for Fitzroy until 1954-55, and he finished with 6,654 runs at an average of 29.31 in 207 First XI matches for the club.|$|E
5|$|This was {{followed}} by a low scoring Second Test in Sydney when Australia were 4/77 needing 223 to win on a poor wicket against the lethal pace of Frank Tyson and Brian Statham. The express Tyson was bowling with the help of tailwind and the slips cordon were over 50m behind the bat. Harvey stood firm while Tyson scattered the stumps of his partners, and he farmed the strike ruthlessly, protecting the tailenders and counter-attacking the England fast bowlers, relying on the cut shot and clipping anything on his pads through the leg side. Schoolboys watching the game leaned over the fence to beckon the boundaries towards them. Last man Bill Johnston came in at 9/145 with 78 runs still required, but protected by Harvey he only had to face 16 balls in 40 minutes and they almost produced an unlikely Australian victory. Harvey continued to attack the bowling, and <b>he</b> <b>hooked</b> Tyson over fine leg's head for four. Together, Harvey and Johnston they had added 39 for the last wicket and halved the runs required. At this point, the Australian pair were confident. Harvey and Johnston felt that Tyson was about to run out of energy, and that their prospects would improve when Hutton would have been forced to change bowlers in the near future. However, it was not enough and England won by 38 runs when Johnston gloved a Tyson delivery down the leg side to the wicket-keeper. Harvey had played what many observers thought was the greatest innings of his life, a defiant, unbeaten 92, exactly half of the Australian innings of 184 in which no other batsmen reached 15.|$|E

25|$|England's innings {{was more}} solid than Australia's - {{the first seven}} batsmen made 21 and three passed 50 - but fell 15 runs short in the first innings. Geoff Pullar (33) and David Sheppard (31) {{struggled}} along with Sheppard edging a ball to the ground near Alan Davidson and Pullar caught by Richie Benaud only for Barry Jarman to signal that it wasn't a chance. Benaud had both men floundering at times, but they stuck to their work until Benaud caught Pullar off his own bowling on 62/1 and had Sheppard taken round the corner by Garth McKenzie for 65/2. This brought Ted Dexter and Colin Cowdrey the crease to see out the session. After tea Dexter sent the ball crashing to the boundary ten times {{as he and his}} vice-captain added 80 runs in 76 minutes. Cowdrey (21) was willing to watch until <b>he</b> <b>hooked</b> Bobby Simpson straight into the hands of Bill Lawry and at ten to six Dexter's confidence - and the lengthening shadows - got the better of him and he drove over a ball from Benaud and was bowled for 70. Alan Smith joined Ken Barrington as a nightwatchman and they saw the day end on 169/4. Barrington thrashed six boundaries off Benaud and Simpson (1/52) in his first 25 runs the next day, adding 51 with Smith (21), who was caught behind when Garth McKenzie was brought into the attack and made several balls left awkwardly off the pitch. Barrington now reverted to his typical, grinding self, taking 210 minutes over his last 40 runs with Peter Parfitt feeling his way to 80 off 244 minutes. Finally the Surrey batsman lost his concentration and skied Benaud to Peter Burge at mid-off for 78 and was replaced by the equally pedestrian Fred Titmus, who prodded his way to 21 in 104 minutes. The end came suddenly, Titmus and Parfitt were caught off Benaud (6/115), McKenzie (3/78) had Barry Knight out for a duck and Fred Trueman for 19 after he hit a six and 2 fours adding 27 runs in 20 minutes for the last wicket with Brian Statham as 361/6 became 362/9 and 389 all out.|$|E

500|$|Feeling {{much more}} confident, D'Oliveira {{expected}} {{to be successful in}} the Oval Test match. Before the game, an unnamed MCC official circulated a story that D'Oliveira had been offered thousands of pounds to keep himself available for the South Africa tour. This was a similar story to that which D'Oliveira had told Oosthuizen; it had probably travelled back to the MCC via South Africa, but was not true. When the game began, Australia held a 1â€“0 lead after four Tests; England needed a win to level the series. England made a reasonable start on the first day, but a late wicket brought D'Oliveira in to bat with the game delicately poised. Oborne observes that D'Oliveira was under huge pressure, both for simple cricketing reasons and because the world was watching to see if he would be successful. Wisden reported: [...] "In the last hour D'Oliveira began his fine effort. <b>He</b> <b>hooked</b> the short ball superbly". At {{the end of the first}} day, he had scored 23 runs.|$|E
500|$|Franklin further {{explains}} in these letters that the jar did not electrically balance itself, but a wire of some conducting material {{had to make}} contact from the inner conductor (plus) to the outer conductor (minus). This way Franklin observed the balancing and combining of the two different states of electricity in the [...] "miraculous bottle." [...] In the later editions of the book Franklin explained in his letters and showed in illustrations an assembly of Leyden jars that he termed [...] "electrical battery" [...] following the military term {{of the time of}} a [...] "battery" [...] being a group of cannons assembled together. Franklin assembled a number of parallel-plate condensers consisting of 11 plates of glass and each were [...] "armed" [...] with a lead metal sheet on each side. <b>He</b> <b>hooked</b> them together with wires in a series and then a master wire was attached that could then discharge (balance) the battery when touched to both sides.|$|E
500|$|Brown was {{regarded}} as a cautious starter who was reluctant to use his full array of strokes. He had an upright stance and was known for his trademark leg glancing and placement of the ball. <b>He</b> <b>hooked</b> occasionally and scored the majority of his off-side runs with the cut shot. Johnnie Moyes said that [...] "even when slow, he never wearied, as some do, because his style was cultured and free from jarring faults". Moyes felt that Brown's superior record on English soil was a result of the crowd attitude, which was more respectful. At Australian grounds, impatient spectators who disliked Brown's cautious batting frequently heckled him, blaming Brown for delaying Bradman's arrival to the crease. [...] Moyes felt that the more serene English gallery allowed Brown to play to his game plan without hastening to placate impatient spectators. [...] "A placid chap was Brown, and he liked to play in peaceful surroundings. When on the job he was as emotionless as a stoic." [...] Moyes said that Brown was [...] "always cool and thoughtful, he preferred finesse to force". The English journalist Neville Cardus commented [...] "His cricket is perpetually keeping an appointment leisurely with moments to spare. Does the bat have an engagement this over with a half-volley? Very well, then, put it down in the book. We'll be there for it. Plenty of time." [...] Bradman also noted Brown's ability to quickly get into position to play the ball, writing [...] "One hallmark of good batting is that the player appears to have plenty of time in which to play his strokes. Bill Brown was an outstanding case of one who never seemed to be in a hurry for any stroke." [...] Ray Robinson said that Brown was [...] "the most serene batsman I ever saw play for Australia". Robinson said that [...] "for artistry, Brown's leg-glancing could be mentioned in the same breath as Archie Jackson's". Brown's placid nature extended to his observations of modern cricketâ€”he disliked the emotional displays made by contemporary players.|$|E

2500|$|Warner {{is known}} for favouring the aerial route with his {{aggressive}} left-handed batting style, [...] and ability to switch hit, using {{the back of his}} bat or by taking a right-handed stance. He is an athletic fielder and also a part-time spin bowler. His bowling style is rare in that he mixes off-spin bowling with his more usual leg-spin bowling. At just 170cm Warner generates his power from strong forearms and his low centre of gravity allows him to get underneath deliveries and hit them high in the air. In a Twenty20 match for New South Wales in 2009, <b>he</b> <b>hooked</b> a six off Shaun Tait that landed {{on the roof of the}} Adelaide Oval, only a month after hooking the same bowler 20 rows back at the SCG.|$|E

[...] Upon making his backswing, his clubhead hooked a weed, or a [...] "creeper" [...] as it was called by Jerome Travers, which caused his ball to move. [...] Hobens, unable to stop his stroke, proceeded to miss the ball completely. [...] The unfortunate result was a one-stroke penalty for causing the ball to move and another stroke for the whiff.

2500|$|Arriving in New York for {{the first}} time in 1928, Schmeling was hardly noticed by the American fight circles.

Schmeling's debut in America took place at Madison Square Garden with an eighth-round knockout of Joe Monte, who was not a top-flight heavyweight but nonetheless had been in with some tough competition. Two more victories led to a fight with Johnny Risko, one of the biggest names in the division, though somewhat beyond his prime. On 1 February 1929, Schmeling floored Risko four times with his right hand before the referee halted the contest in the ninth round, handing Risko his only loss by TKO.

He had the gas of the Constitution transferred to the Intrepid and was up in the air in 15 minutes. From this new vantage point, Lowe was able to report on all the Confederate movements.

You may take them out and wine them and dine them, but that is all you may do", though years later Cowdrey would marry the eldest, Lady Anne. Cowdrey had a poor start to the tour and made three successive ducks, which Jack Fingleton blamed on his fondness for golf. However, Cowdrey made the highest score of his career against South Australia on Christmas Eve (his birthday). He caressed his way to 307 in 369 minutes and beat Frank Woolley's 305 not out against Tasmania in 1911â€“12 as the highest score by a tourist in Australia {{and it was the}} highest first-class score in Australia for 18 years. Cowdrey added 103 runs with David Sheppard (81), 98 with Ken Barrington, then stroked 344 runs with fellow stylist Tom Graveney (122 not out), striking 4 sixes and 29 fours, until he was out and Dexter declared on 586/5. Fresh from his triumph at Adelaide Cowdrey made his only century of the series in the Second Test at Melbourne after joining Dexter at 19/2. They withstood Alan Davidson's burst of speed, but the other bowlers failed to trouble them and by stealing quick ones, twos and threes they rebuilt the innings. Dexter was out for 93, but the stand had made 175 runs and Cowdrey made 113, his third and highest century in Australia, but the celebrations were short lived as <b>he</b> <b>hooked</b> into the hands of Peter Burge off Garth McKenzie.

2500|$|England batted after Ted Dexter won the toss and he {{soon came}} in as David Sheppard edged the ball off Alan Davidson {{into the hands}} of Garth McKenzie. He played a subdued innings against Davidson's swing and McKenzie's lift and added 61 in 79 minutes with Geoff Pullar before he was out cutting Richie Benaud to Bill Lawry at short-leg for 32. He was {{replaced}} by the in-form Colin Cowdrey who added another 67 with Pullar who constantly looked like getting out, without doing so. He batted over half the day for 53 when <b>he</b> <b>hooked</b> Simpson to Benaud, who took a nice low catch. Ken Barrington and Cowdrey were the most difficult batsmen to dismiss, though Davidson though Dexter was the most difficult to bowl to, and looked set to stay as they took England past 200/3. It was here that the English batting imploded, Cowdrey was caught at the wicket off Simpson for 85, and the part-time spinner had Peter Parfitt was caught by Lawry sitting in his hip-pocket for 0. Benaud now took the overdue new ball and Davidson (4/54) whipped in a couple of in-swingers to trap first Barrington (35) and then John Murray (0) lbw and England were 221/7. The [...] "Fighting Freds" [...] Titmus (32) and Trueman (32) saw out the day with a stand of 35, despite Titmus being dropped by Barry Jarman and by Brian Booth in the deep, which they took to 52 the next morning when Simpson got Trueman and Brian Statham with successive balls, but missed his hat-trick and Titmus saw his stumps sent cartwheeling by Davidson to end the innings on 279. Simpson's 5/57 remained his career best Test bowling and Benaud's 1/60 took him to 228 wickets to match Ray Lindwall's Australian record. Another record was the gate, which on the first day produced Â£12,534 and 5 shillings. The attendance of 54,476 was a new record for a Friday and second only to the Saturday of the Second Test in 1928-29 when over 58,000 people saw called some bloke called Don Bradman serving drinks as 12th man.
