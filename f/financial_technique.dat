Throughout, significant amounts of volunteer contributions of labor and material helped. Approximately $900,000 was raised, and after a nearly ten-year restoration process, the Opera House is now open and for another century of public service as a multi-purpose community cultural center.|$|E

The conventional system, however, offers a life insurance policy, which may not be free from Ribâ (interest), or some other elements, which are not recognized by Islamic teaching. Based on the observation of the practices of life insurance policies under the conventional system many Muslims, and even some Islamic scholars, diametrically oppose the idea of life insurance policies, but have not come up with an Islamic alternative model to the conventional one, which would meet the expectations of contemporary Muslims and would protect widows, orphans and other dependents in society from unpredicted future financial risk. Hence, the central idea of the model of an Islamic life insurance is that, it is not a policy to insure one’s own life, but is a financial transaction relying on the principles of mutual cooperation, to undertake a responsibility towards safeguarding widows, orphans and other dependents of the deceased (assured), from future financial risk, which does not involve the elements of ‘Ribâ ’ but is operated {{along the lines of the}} following principles of the ‘al-Mudhârabah ’ <b>financial</b> <b>technique,</b> while neither clashing with the principle...|$|E

40|$|Risk, or {{exposure}} to uncertainty, is an inherent part of software development. It is therefore {{an important factor}} in software investment decisions. This paper presents a disciplined approach to treating technology risk [...] -an approach that links software development decisions to be linked to the financial markets. The approach relies on the premise that uncertainty creates value when managed properly. The paper demonstrates the utility of securities in estimating the risk underlying an investment in software development. It accomplishes this objective by means of a familiar development scenario that is subject to the uncertainty of a particular software technology: Java. The estimate of the underlying risk helps determine the value of the scenario. The valuation is performed through real options analysis, a <b>financial</b> <b>technique</b> well suited to deal with investment decisions under uncertainty.

40|$|There is {{a strong}} case that mortgage-backed {{securities}} were {{at the root of}} the 2007 - 09 financial crisis. Even though geographers have convincingly demonstrated that loan origination is strongly locally rooted and that the fallout from the subprime mortgage crisis clearly had spatially circumscribed effects, securitization is still generally perceived as a universal, private, and purely market-based <b>financial</b> <b>technique.</b> In this paper we use a description of the securitization chain in the Netherlands to contest these perceptions. Building on and adding to Thomas Wainwright’s analysis of securitization in the UK, we first argue that securitization in the Netherlands has taken a form which reflects Dutch corporatist institutional arrangements, implying that both geography and states do matter for the supposedly aspatial process of securitization. Second, we argue that the Dutch state has been very much implicated in the construction of the securitization market in the Netherlands. Third, we suggest that this can best be seen as an effect of ‘cognitive closure’ rather than of ‘regulatory capture’: that is, Dutch pro-banking regulation is not so much an effect of bankers hijacking regulators but, rather, more the result of bankers seducing regulators with their stories. This paper is a detailed case study of the workings of financialization and adds to the growing body of work which seeks to analyze the different ‘varieties of financialization’ and the variegated geographies of the financial crisis...|$|E
40|$|This study values a {{large-scale}} Space Solar Power (SSP) venture by using Real Option Analysis (ROA), an advanced <b>financial</b> <b>technique</b> that takes manage-rial flexibility into account. We develop {{a model to}} represent the entire project {{as a series of}} decisions in a binomial tree. We calibrate the tree using data from energy markets as well as Monte Carlo simulations of the distribution of project value under expected conditions. In the end, specific sources of flexibility are formulated as Real Options within the binomial tree and the cal-culated value of these options is added to the Net Present Value (NPV) of the project. Unlike previous studies that argue SSP is economically unfeasible, we conclude that large-scale SSP is a viable business venture as long as the project is implemented in stages and real options are exercised optimally. Previous studies on the economic feasibility of SSP have used only static Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) models, which assume that a project will be carried out until completion under any circumstances. Our study, on the other hand, incorpo-rates the flexibility to enter or abandon the project in response to energy prices, launch costs, and other technological parameters that affect the viability of the project. Modern decision analysis tools demonstrate that such flexibility adds tremendous value to a venture facing large uncertainties, {{as is the case with}} SSP. 1 We would like to acknowledge the guidance of Vladimir Atanasov, Professor of Finance at The College of William and Mary, in his capacity as thesis adviser and his insights and assistance during this process.

40|$|While {{there has}} been {{extensive}} research {{on the use of}} financial appraisal techniques (Pay back, Return on Capital Employed, Internal Rate of Return and Net Present Value) in the Investment Appraisal Process (lAP), little research has been conducted {{on the role of the}} Real Options Approach (ROA) and Managerial Judgement (MJ) in the IAP. In an ideal world, prior to making Strategic Investment Decisions (SIDs), a detailed analysis of the benefits generated by the investments would be conducted. This would cover financial and nonfinancial benefits. In practice, however, many investments are undertaken on the basis of financial returns with little or no analysis of the growth options embedded in the proposed investments. The exploitation of these options contributes to the enhancement of the business strategy as financial returns do. Essential to considering these options in the IAP is the deployment ofMJ inthe lAP. This thesis aims to make a sound contribution to the development of the emerging literature on capital budgeting. First, it provides a critical review of the existing investment appraisal literature. Second, it investigates whether or not British Automotive Components Manufacturers (BACMs) deploy the ROA and MJ in the lAP in order to accommodate the growth options. And fmally, it presents an alternative perspective of the IAP by the development of a conceptual framework that integrates the ROA & MJ into the lAP, while taking account ofproject risk and business strategy. This research draws on a 73 -firm survey of finance directors in this industry enhanced by fieldwork (11 interviews) to set out the relative importance of the strategic approach (ROA informed by MJ) and financial analysis when making the SIDs. The findings from the survey show similar results to earlier studies in relation to the popularity of PB and the use of more than one <b>financial</b> <b>technique</b> in the lAP. However, in contrast to previous studies, DCF techniques seem to be less popular and higher usage of ROCE is evident, and no relationship is found between company size and the range and type of techniques used in the lAP. The main thrust of the findings of the statistical analysis is the absence of the formal adoption of the ROA in the IAP. However, the impact of the growth options regarding the deployment of MJ in the lAP appeared to be evident. The analysis shows that MJ is considered when assessing both investments with growth options and risky projects. The fieldwork provides insights into the context of the lAP and the factors that influence the deployment of the ROA and MJ in the lAP. Conclusions are drawn regarding the interrelationships between financial analysis and the ROA and MJ in the lAP. The integration of the ROA and MJ into the lAP appears to involve moving the focus of attention in the lAP away from financial analysis and a short-term perspective towards a more strategic perspective. More importantly, it contributes to bridging the gap between risk management and strategic analysis...|$|E

Falls within the above activities, which in their structure appear undeniably complex, the financial transaction of leveraged buyouts, which, from {{the second half of the}} eighties, has had a great spread as, the changing international economic environments have a strong acceleration in termination corporate restructuring carried out with the clear objective of reaching an outcome dimensional as to be able to effectively compete in the free market. It is evident that this operation presents a significant risk factor, as structured on a high level of indebtedness, the success of which is subjected to the perfect agreement between the many actors who, for various reasons, are taking part, namely: the merchant bank, which plays the role of coordinator of the entire maneuver; credit institutions, ranging to provide the necessary funding, administrators, involved in governance issues relating to the acquisition and subsequent merger of the companies involved in the. acquisition technique, described as leveraged buyouts, developed in Anglo-Saxon countries, and particularly in the United States, starting with the end of the seventies, such as the development of a specific phenomenon characterized by the purchase of shares of a public company by a few " investors ' private (so-called going private). Subsequently, it has evolved into a <b>financial</b> <b>technique</b> of acquiring particularly frequent and effective until the first half of the nineties, during which, however, due to a combination of factors such as the economic crisis or the rise in interest rates, lost relief flowing in a series of failures in both the United States and in Europa. Tutto this has led to attitudes of suspicion and aversion biased against the legitimacy of this operation, following the interpretation that part of the Italian doctrine proposed, the main legal, economic and fiscal closely related to it. Although the case law, concerning the lawfulness of such maneuvers, after some negative judgments, has subsequently changed orientation in the sense of believing the transactions concerned lawful provided they have a valid "business reason". In the wake of these concerns and in order to resolve doubts about the legality of the leveraged buyout, the legislature of the Corporate Law Reform introduced into Italian law a positive discipline to do this: it is, as you know, art. 2501 bis of the Civil Code, which regulates the LBO implemented through the merger (the so-called merger levereged buyout). It is, thus, put an end to a conflict, constant doctrine, as to the legality of the maneuver in question, currently due to mergers occurring as a result of the acquisition with debt. In particular, the " leveraged buyout " was considered, as a great part of the doctrine longer dating, illegal, being contrary to the original provisions of art. 2358. civ., that " the company can not make loans, nor provide security for the purchase or subscription of shares. Society can not, either directly or through trust companies or nominees, to accept its own shares as collateral. " Of is particularly important in this regard to the case law that has ruled on the matter, at first in a negative sense, but then, in the sense of believing lawful operations MLBO provided they have a valid "business reason", being necessary therefore, an investigation into the concrete, ensure the lawfulness of the operation in each case, namely an investigation that verifies the existence or otherwise of an intention to evade the rule in art. 2358.
