5|$|The humid weather {{meant that}} the game was played at a {{relatively}} slow pace, which seemed to favour Porto. This caused a number of rash challenges from Celtic, one of which led to Joos Valgaeren getting a yellow card on 8 minutes. After this {{it was very much}} a stoic affair, until 32 minutes into the first half when Capucho played in Deco, but he could <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> fire his shot straight at Celtic's goalkeeper Robert Douglas. Straight after this attack Celtic broke on the counter with Henrik Larsson, putting Didier Agathe through on the right, but his cross was too high for Chris Sutton. Larsson had a chance to make it 1–0 on 35 minutes, but from Sutton's assist he was unable to make enough contact with the ball. Porto came close on 41 minutes when Deco moved past Bobo Baldé to go one on one against Robert Douglas, who saved Deco's shot with his legs. Porto finally found a way through on 45 minutes when, after an offensive play from Deco, Derlei followed up Dmitri Alenichev's shot on target, which had been saved by Robert Douglas. This gave Porto a 1–0 lead on the stroke of half time and Derlei's 11th goal of the competition.|$|E
5|$|The 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions {{reported}} reaching and capturing {{their first}} objective, the Black Line, by 6:25am. The 4th Canadian Division encountered {{a great deal}} of trouble during its advance and was unable to complete its first objective until some hours later. After a planned pause, when the 1st, 2nd and 3rd Canadian Divisions consolidated their positions, the advance resumed. Shortly after 7:00am, the 1st Canadian Division captured the left half of its second objective, the Red Line and moved the 1st Canadian Brigade forward to mount an attack on the remainder. The 2nd Canadian Division reported reaching the Red Line and capturing the village of Les Tilleuls at approximately the same time. A mine explosion that killed many German troops of the Reserve Infantry Regiment 262 manning the front line preceded the advance of the 3rd Canadian Division. The remaining German troops could <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> man temporary lines of resistance until later manning a full defence at the German third line. As a result, the southern section of the 3rd Canadian Division was able to reach the Red Line at {{the western edge of the}} Bois de la Folie at around 7:30am. At 9:00am the division learned of its exposed left flank, as the 4th Canadian Division had not yet captured Hill 145. The 3rd Canadian Division was thus called upon to establish a divisional defensive flank to its north. Although the German commanders were able to maintain open lines of communication and issue operating orders, even with swift staff work the tempo of the assault was such that German decision cycle was unable to react decisively.|$|E

Some Hungarians held out hope for full separation from Austria; others wanted an accommodation with the Habsburgs, provided that they respected Hungary's constitution and laws. Ferenc Deák became the main advocate for accommodation. Deak upheld {{the legality of}} the April laws and argued that their amendment required the Hungarian Diet's consent.

This was the largest force ever to advance so far into the interior, but it failed to secure a decisive engagement with the enemy.

But as time went on, as the Beatles began their dominance of the music charts and the worldwide phenomenon known as Beatlemania began, Presley became less and less successful. His films still made money and his albums still sold well, but the profits were falling. This led Parker to insist that films be made cheaply, on a strict schedule, and with as little hassle as possible.|$|E

25|$|As the Winter War between Finland and Soviet Union {{concluded}} by March 1940, Soviet Union began increasing diplomatic {{pressure on}} Lithuania. Raštikis was invited {{back to the}} military, but he agreed only to take the position of director of the military academy on June 7. A week later he was called to the emergency government meeting discussing the Soviet ultimatum. He opined that mounting military resistance when Soviet troops were already in the country was impossible. He also opposed diplomatic protests as such empty actions would <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> antagonize the Russians and invite repressions. In accordance with the Soviet demand of a new more pro-Soviet government (which {{became known as the}} People's Government of Lithuania), Raštikis was slated to become the new Prime Minister, but he was not acceptable to Moscow and the selection of another candidate was supervised by Molotov's deputy Vladimir Dekanozov.|$|E
25|$|On September 12, 1960, Hurricane Donna {{passed over}} Tower 4, causing severe {{structural}} damage, including {{the loss of}} the flying bridge hanging beneath the platform, and one of the communications dishes. After assessment of the damage and initial repairs it was decided to reduce staffing to a skeleton crew and prepare to dismantle the station. The site could not simply be abandoned for fear that the Soviets would board it and remove sensitive equipment and documentation. Dismantling of the tower was therefore protracted. At the approach of another storm in January 1961 evacuation of the station was impeded by the inability of the commander to make contact with any of his three immediate superiors; nonetheless the New Bedford set out for the platform. As the storm built, , which was in the vicinity, was also dispatched with the intent of evacuating the station via helicopter, shore aircraft being unable to take off. Both ships reached the vicinity but could <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> watch the station disappear from their radar. No survivors were recovered, though divers were sent down on the chance that some might have been trapped in the wreckage. Twenty-eight airmen and civilian contractors perished.|$|E

Newitz suggests that part of the appeal of Oh My Goddess! is the romantic nature of the story: [...] "In anime, romantic love is possible because overt sexuality is not".

500|$|Nationally, the Whigs were irreparably split by the Kansas–Nebraska Act {{and other}} efforts to {{compromise}} on the slavery issue.

[...] Drawing on the antislavery portion of the Whig Party, and combining Free Soil, Liberty, and antislavery Democratic Party members, the new Republican Party formed as a northern party dedicated to antislavery. Lincoln resisted early attempts to recruit him to the new party, fearing that it {{would serve as a}} platform for extreme abolitionists.

Constitutional theorists have had differing views as to whether a unilateral dissolution of Parliament would be possible today; Sir Ivor Jennings wrote that a dissolution involves [...] "the acquiescence of ministers", and as such the monarch could not dissolve Parliament without ministerial consent; [...] "if ministers refuse to give such advice, she can <b>do</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> dismiss them". A. V. Dicey, however, believed that in certain extreme circumstances the monarch could dissolve Parliament single-handedly, on the condition that [...] "an occasion has arisen on which there is fair reason to suppose that the opinion of the House is not the opinion of the electors...

500|$|The Lithuanian government—given {{less than}} 12 hours to respond—debated the {{ultimatum}} {{during the night}} session.

Soviet troops were stationed in Lithuania since October 1939 and acted honorably – the Soviets would surely continue to be reasonable. Bizauskas, a member of the opposition, saw the ultimatum as an opportunity {{to get rid of the}} Smetona regime. Historians cited his attitudes to illustrate his incomprehension of the dire situation. Raštikis, as the potential head of a new government, was invited to the meeting. Both former and current Chief Military Commanders Raštikis and Vincas Vitkauskas reported that mounting an effective armed resistance, when Soviet troops were already in the country and the Lithuanian military was not mobilized, was impossible. The government also rejected a diplomatic protest.
