25|$|With this in mind, {{mindful of}} the {{mounting}} issues in Hartford and growing opposition to the deal, {{in the spring of}} 1999, Kraft announced that he was abandoning the Hartford stadium project. Kraft, preferring to keep the team where it was, eventually reached a mutually acceptable deal with the Massachusetts legislature for the necessary infrastructure improvements. The final hurdle the stadium needed to clear was approval by the citizens of Foxborough on six separate measures. Despite some initial hesitation regarding a proposed <b>dedicated</b> <b>access</b> road for premium ticket holders, the Patriots won approval on each measure by an over 90% majority. This cleared the way for what was originally known as CMGi Field to be built adjacent to the old stadium in Foxboro. The naming rights to the stadium were originally purchased by CMGi, an e-commerce company based in nearby Waltham, Massachusetts, which, at the time, was parent company to internet auction site uBid.|$|E

A company called iSkoot (now Qualcomm iSkoot Inc.) was behind {{at least some of}} the clients and back-end servers but iSkoot announced a shutdown scheduled for 20 January 2011.
