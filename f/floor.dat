5|$|On February 23, 1991, {{at about}} 8:23 PM, a fire {{began on the}} 22nd <b>floor</b> of the {{building}}. It was a Saturday night and {{there were only three}} people in the building at the time, an engineer and two security guards. Workers had been refinishing woodwork in a vacant office earlier in the day and workers left a pile of rags soaked in linseed oil on the <b>floor.</b> The linseed oil oxidized and generated enough heat to ignite the rags, which then set fire to other solvents nearby. Smoke detectors did not cover the entire <b>floor</b> {{and by the time the}} fire alarm went off the fire was already well established. After the fire alarm sounded in the building the engineer went up to the 22nd <b>floor</b> to investigate. When the elevator reached the 22nd <b>floor</b> the engineer found heavy smoke and heat that prevented him from reaching the elevator controls he needed to return to the lobby. The engineer escaped after radioing to a security guard in the lobby to recall the elevator using fire safety controls there. The second security guard was on the 30th <b>floor</b> when the alarm went off and used the stairwell to get to the ground <b>floor.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of the adaptations made to Palladianism in America {{was that}} the piano nobile now tended {{to be placed on}} the ground <b>floor,</b> rather than above a service <b>floor,</b> as was the {{tradition}} in Europe. This service <b>floor,</b> if it existed at all, was now a discreet semi-basement. This negated the need for an ornate external staircase leading to the main entrance as in the more original Palladian designs. This would also be a feature of the neoclassical style that followed Palladianism.|$|E
