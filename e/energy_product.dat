50|$|The {{magnetic}} hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet theoretically takes on a shape resembling that of a summation of its hard and soft magnetic components (as seen in Figure 1), meaning its <b>energy</b> <b>product</b> is {{higher than those of}} its components. A magnet’s maximum <b>energy</b> <b>product</b> (BH)max, which is roughly proportional to its coercivity (HC) and magnetization saturation (Msat), is used as a metric of its ability to do magnetic work as (BH)max is twice the magnet’s available magnetostatic energy. The exchange spring magnet offers a geometry able to improve upon the previously reported maximum energy products of materials such as Rare Earth/Transition Metal complexes; while both materials have sufficiently large HC values and operate at relatively high Curie Temperatures, the exchange spring magnet can achieve much higher Msat values than the Rare Earth/Transition Metal (RE-TM) complexes.|$|E
