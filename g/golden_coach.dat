He remembers Gerda, but he stays there because his heart is a lump of ice like the Snow Queen. The princess and her consort send Gerda on her way with a <b>golden</b> <b>coach</b> and attendants. While the coach travels through a dark woods, they are stopped by a gang of robbers, who take Gerda and strip the coach of its gold plate, sparing the attendants. An old hag takes Gerda, but when she is bitten on the ear by her daughter Angel, who is riding on her back, she listens to her request to keep Gerda with her other captive pets. These pets include a fox, little rabbits, the birds that were spared the Snow Queen's frost earlier, and a large reindeer, named Bucky Boy. The birds tell Gerda that they saw the Snow Queen take Kay with her to Lapland. The reindeer offers to take Gerda there. It remains for the robber girl to let Gerda and Bucky Boy go, which she does. She also releases the birds, the fox, and the rabbits, but they decide to stay with her.|$|E
2500|$|Magnani {{then went}} on to star as Camille (stage name: Columbine) in Jean Renoir's film Le Carrosse d'or (also known as The <b>Golden</b> <b>Coach)</b> in 1953. Here she played a woman torn between three men - a soldier, a bullfighter, and a viceroy. Renoir called her [...] "the {{greatest}} actress I have ever worked with".|$|E

2500|$|Her {{appearance}} on the political scene was almost immediately marked by controversy. [...] In 1965, Princess Beatrix became engaged to the German aristocrat Claus von Amsberg, a diplomat working for the German Foreign Office. Their marriage caused a massive protest during the wedding day in Amsterdam on 10 March 1966. Prince Claus {{had served in the}} Hitler Youth and the Wehrmacht and was, therefore, associated by a part of the Dutch population with German Nazism. Protests included such memorable slogans as [...] "Claus 'raus!" [...] (Claus out!) and [...] "Mijn fiets terug" [...] ("Return my bicycle" [...] – a reference to occupying German soldiers confiscating Dutch bicycles during WWII). A smoke bomb was thrown at the <b>Golden</b> <b>Coach</b> by a group of Provos causing a violent street battle with the police. As time went on, Prince Claus {{became one of the most}} popular members of the Dutch monarchy and his 2002 death was widely mourned.|$|E
6000|$|In those days, Cinderella's <b>golden</b> <b>coach</b> dashing {{round the}} corner to carry her away was the {{favorite}} dream; but at eighteen one thinks more of the prince than either <b>golden</b> <b>coach</b> or splendid ball.

60|$|The sword clanked for {{the third}} time, and the king said angrily: 'Well, if you want him so much you can have him; only never let me see his face again.' And he made a sign to the hangman. The bandage {{was removed from the}} young man's eyes, and the cords from his wrists, and he took his seat in the <b>golden</b> <b>coach</b> beside the king of the Magyars. Then the coachman whipped up his horses, and they set out for Buda.|$|E
60|$|Jacob Stuck {{thought he}} had never seen anyone so {{beautiful}} in all his life. It was like the sunlight shining in his eyes, and he almost sneezed. Her cheeks were like milk and rose-leaves, and her hair like fine threads of gold. She sat in a <b>golden</b> <b>coach</b> with a golden crown upon her head, and Jacob Stuck stood looking and looking until his heart melted within him like wax in the oven. Then the princess was gone, and Jacob Stuck stood there sighing and sighing.|$|E
60|$|Vanity Fair--Vanity Fair! Here was a man, {{who could}} not spell, and did not care to read--who had the habits and the cunning of a boor: whose aim in life was pettifogging: who never had a taste, or emotion, or enjoyment, but what was sordid and foul; and yet he had rank, and honours, and power, somehow: and was a {{dignitary}} of the land, and a pillar of the state. He was high sheriff, and rode in a <b>golden</b> <b>coach.</b> Great ministers and statesmen courted him; and in Vanity Fair he had a higher place than the most brilliant genius or spotless virtue.|$|E

He helped develop All-ACC linebackers James Farrior and Jamie Sharper, {{both of whom were}} chosen in the 1997 NFL Draft. He then coached linebackers at Boston College from 1997 to 1999 under Tom O'Brien.

6000|$|And now the Horse Guards, {{a glimpse}} of {{beautiful}} cream ponies, and a golden panoply, a hurricane of cheers, the crashing of bands--"The King! the King! God save the King!" [...] Everybody has gone mad. The contagion is sweeping me off my feet--I, too, want to shout, [...] "The King! God save the King!" [...] Ragged men about me, tears in their eyes, are tossing up their hats and crying ecstatically, [...] "Bless 'em! Bless 'em! Bless 'em!"

60|$|That {{very day}} a gallows was built outside the town, {{and all the}} people crowded round to see the {{execution}} of the young man who had dared to beat the king's daughter. The prisoner, with his hands tied behind his back, was brought out by the hangman, and amidst dead silence his sentence was being read by the judge when suddenly the sword clanked against his side. Instantly a great noise was heard and a <b>golden</b> <b>coach</b> rumbled over the stones, with a white flag waving out of the window. It stopped underneath the gallows, and from it stepped the king of the Magyars, who begged that the life of the boy might be spared.|$|E

60|$|For {{many days}} life went {{on like a}} {{beautiful}} dream to the charcoal-burner and his wife. Their beds were so comfortable, they could hardly {{make up their minds}} to get up, their clothes were so lovely they could scarcely bring themselves to take them off; their dinners were so good that they found it very difficult to leave off eating. Then outside the palace were gardens filled with rare flowers and fruits and singing birds, or if they desired to go further, a <b>golden</b> <b>coach,</b> painted with wreaths of forget-me-nots and lined with blue satin, awaited their orders. Sometimes it happened that the king came to see them, and he smiled as he glanced at the man, who was getting rosier and plumper each day. But when his eyes rested on the woman, they took on a look which seemed to say 'I knew it,' though this neither the charcoal-burner nor his wife ever noticed.|$|E
60|$|The man moved {{a little}} further away, {{as soon as he}} could, and the mender of roads fanned himself with his blue cap: feeling it mightily close and oppressive. If he needed a King and Queen to restore him, he was {{fortunate}} in having his remedy at hand; for, soon the large-faced King and the fair-faced Queen came in their <b>golden</b> <b>coach,</b> attended by the shining Bull's Eye of their Court, a glittering multitude of laughing ladies and fine lords; and in jewels and silks and powder and splendour and elegantly spurning figures and handsomely disdainful faces of both sexes, the mender of roads bathed himself, so much to his temporary intoxication, that he cried Long live the King, Long live the Queen, Long live everybody and everything! as if he had never heard of ubiquitous Jacques in his time. Then, there were gardens, courtyards, terraces, fountains, green banks, more King and Queen, more Bull's Eye, more lords and ladies, more Long live they all! until he absolutely wept with sentiment. During the whole of this scene, which lasted some three hours, he had plenty of shouting and weeping and sentimental company, and throughout Defarge held him by the collar, as if to restrain him from flying at the objects of his brief devotion and tearing them to pieces.|$|E
