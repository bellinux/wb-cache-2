[...] Emily {{paused a moment}} to acquire nerve to proceed, and then related to her {{astonished}} sister the little history of her own disappointments. She did not affect to conceal her attachment for Denbigh. With glowing cheeks she acknowledged, that she found a necessity for all her efforts to keep her rebellious feelings yet in subjection; and as she recounted generally his conduct to Mrs. Fitzgerald, she concluded by saying, [...] "But, Jane, I can see enough to call forth my gratitude; and although, with yourself, I feel at this moment as if my affections were sealed for ever, I wish to make no <b>hasty</b> <b>resolutions,</b> nor act in any manner as if I were unworthy of the lot Providence has assigned me." ...|$|E
60|$|But, in {{the midst}} of those resolves, I told the council of officers, my design was to the north part of the island, where a gang of pirates were said to be settled, and that I was persuaded I might get a good ship among them, and as many men as we desired, for that I was {{satisfied}} the greatest part of them were so wearied of their present situation, that they would be glad of an opportunity to come away, and especially such as had, either by force, or rash, <b>hasty</b> <b>resolutions,</b> been, as it were, surprised into that sort of life; that I had been informed they were very far from being in such a formidable posture as they had been represented to us in Europe, or anything near so numerous; but that, on the contrary, we should find them poor, divided, in distress, and willing to get away upon any terms they could.|$|E

5000|$|RT Book Reviews gave Beautiful Bastard three stars, {{saying that}} while the book [...] "is filled with plenty of hot sex and sizzling tension between boss Bennett and {{employee}} Chloe", the alternating viewpoints [...] "proves distracting rather than providing depth" [...] and that [...] "the level at which this couple loathes {{each other for the}} majority of the story makes the <b>hasty</b> <b>resolution</b> hard to believe".|$|R

I see that more company is arriving; and, since I have {{the good fortune to}} renew my former {{acquaintance}} with Lady Ashton, I hope she will give me leave to avoid perilling what I prize so highly upon any disagreeable subject of discussion--at least till we have talked over more pleasant topics." ...|$|R
60|$|The Major and Benjamin both opposed this <b>hasty</b> <b>resolution</b> on my part. They {{appealed to}} my own sense of self-respect, without (so far as I {{remember}} it) producing the slightest effect on my mind. They were more successful when they entreated me next to be patient for my husband's sake. In mercy to Eustace, they begged me to wait half an hour. If he failed to return in that time, they pledged themselves to accompany me in search of him to the hotel.|$|R
60|$|The {{reconciliation}} made Ebbo retract his <b>hasty</b> <b>resolution</b> of relinquishing all {{the benefits}} resulting from his connection with the Sorel family, and his mother's fortune {{made it possible to}} carry out many changes that rendered the castle and its inmates far more prosperous in appearance than had ever been the case before. Christina had once again the appliances of a wirthschaft, such as she felt to be the suitable and becoming appurtenance of a right-minded Frau, gentle or simple, and she felt so much the happier and more respectable.|$|R
50|$|The poem The Poetresses <b>hasty</b> <b>Resolution,</b> {{like many}} of Cavendish’s epistles, {{contained}} excuses for any errors that might {{be found in the}} poet’s work and begged for praise. In the poem, the poet stated that self-love influenced her judgement of her own poetry, which she found she liked so much that she was moved to continue writing in hope of fame. She said that she wrote without thought about how her work would be received by critics. The poet then recalled how she was visited by Reason who advised her to stop writing. Reason told her that her writing was a waste of time, that her work would not be well received and that she should not have her work printed so that the printer would not lose money. Reason also informed the poet that there were already too many books and that she should burn what she had written to spare the world from even more. The poet noted her angry response and stated that she sent her book to press before she could be persuaded otherwise. In hindsight, however, she regretted her actions. Informing the reader that she felt shamed by her writing, the poet told the reader to pity her and wipe away her tears with praise.|$|R
60|$|Now {{that she}} was {{whirling}} away for London in real earnest, Rosa was at leisure to resume the thoughts which her personal hurry had checked. The indignant thought that his declaration of love soiled her; that she could only be cleansed from the stain of its impurity by appealing to the honest and true; supported her for a time against her fears, and confirmed her in her <b>hasty</b> <b>resolution.</b> But as the evening grew darker and darker, and the great city impended nearer and nearer, the doubts usual in such cases began to arise. Whether {{this was not a}} wild proceeding, after all; how Mr. Grewgious might regard it; whether she should find him at the journey’s end; how she would act if he were absent; what might become of her, alone, in a place so strange and crowded; how if she had but waited and taken counsel first; whether, if she could now go back, she would not do it thankfully; a multitude of such uneasy speculations disturbed her, more and more as they accumulated. At length the train came into London over the housetops; and down below lay the gritty streets with their yet un-needed lamps a-glow, on a hot, light, summer night.|$|R
60|$|Yet this {{resolution}} was scarcely formed ere {{it began to}} fluctuate, when he reflected upon the fittest manner of carrying it into execution. To show himself at a distance, might give the lady an opportunity of turning back and avoiding the interview which he had determined upon--to hide himself till the moment when her horse, in rapid motion, should pass his lurking-place, might be attended with danger to the rider--and while he hesitated which course to pursue, there was some chance of his missing the opportunity of presenting himself to Miss Mowbray at all. He was himself sensible of this, formed a <b>hasty</b> and desperate <b>resolution</b> not to suffer the present moment to escape, and, just as the ascent induced the pony to slacken its pace, Tyrrel {{stood in the middle}} of the defile, about six yards distant from the young lady.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{now take}} my leave of you, sweet girl," [...] said Louisa, [...] "sincerely wishing you success on Sabbath next." [...] When Ambulinia's letter was handed to Elfonzo, he perused it without doubting its contents. Louisa charged {{him to make}} but few confidants; but like most young men who {{happened}} to win {{the heart of a}} beautiful girl, he was so elated with the idea that he felt as a commanding general on parade, who had confidence in all, consequently gave orders to all. The appointed Sabbath, with a delicious breeze and cloudless sky, made its appearance. The people gathered in crowds to the church--the streets were filled with neighboring citizens, all marching to the house of worship. It is entirely useless for me to attempt to describe the feelings of Elfonzo and Ambulinia, who were silently watching the movements of the multitude, apparently counting them as then entered the house of God, looking for the last one to darken the door. The impatience and anxiety with which they waited, and the bliss they anticipated on the eventful day, is altogether indescribable. Those that have been so fortunate as to embark in such a noble enterprise know all its realities; and those who have not had this inestimable privilege will have to taste its sweets before they can tell to others its joys, its comforts, and its Heaven-born worth. Immediately after Ambulinia had assisted the family off to church, she took advantage of that opportunity to make good her promises. She left a home of enjoyment to be wedded to one whose love had been justifiable. A few short steps brought her to the presence of Louisa, who urged her to make good use of her time, and not to delay a moment, but to go with her to her brother's house, where Elfonzo would forever make her happy. With lively speed, and yet a graceful air, she entered the door and found herself protected by the champion of her confidence. The necessary arrangements were fast making to have the two lovers united--everything was in readiness except the parson; and as they are generally very sanctimonious on such occasions, the news got to the parents of Ambulinia before the everlasting knot was tied, and they both came running, with uplifted hands and injured feelings, to arrest their daughter from an unguarded and <b>hasty</b> <b>resolution.</b> Elfonzo desired to maintain his ground, but Ambulinia thought it best for him to leave, to prepare for a greater contest. He accordingly obeyed, as {{it would have been a}} vain endeavor for him to have battled against a man who was armed with deadly weapons; and besides, he could not resist the request of such a pure heart. Ambulinia concealed herself in the upper story of the house, fearing the rebuke of her father; the door was locked, and no chastisement was now expected. Esquire Valeer, whose pride was already touched, resolved to preserve the dignity of his family. He entered the house almost exhausted, looking wildly for Ambulinia. [...] "Amazed and astonished indeed I am," [...] said he, [...] "at a people who call themselves civilized, to allow such behavior as this. Ambulinia, Ambulinia!" [...] he cried, [...] "come to the calls of your first, your best, and your only friend. I appeal to you, sir," [...] turning to the gentleman of the house, [...] "to know where Ambulinia has gone, or where is she?" [...] "Do you mean to insult me, sir, in my own house?" [...] inquired the gentleman. [...] "I will burst," [...] said Mr. V., [...] "asunder every door in your dwelling, in search of my daughter, if you do not speak quickly, and tell me where she is. I care nothing about that outcast rubbish of creation, that mean, low-lived Elfonzo, if I can but obtain Ambulinia. Are you not going to open this door?" [...] said he. [...] "By the Eternal that made Heaven and earth! I will go about the work instantly, if this is not done!" [...] The confused citizens gathered from all parts of the village, to know the cause of this commotion. Some rushed into the house; the door that was locked flew open, and there stood Ambulinia, weeping. [...] "Father, be still," [...] said she, [...] "and I will follow thee home." [...] But the agitated man seized her, and bore her off through the gazing multitude. [...] "Father!" [...] she exclaimed, [...] "I humbly beg your pardon--I will be dutiful--I will obey thy commands. Let the sixteen years I have lived in obedience to thee by my future security." [...] "I don't like to be always giving credit, when the old score is not paid up, madam," [...] said the father. The mother followed almost in a state of derangement, crying and imploring her to think beforehand, and ask advice from experienced persons, and they would tell her it was a rash undertaking. [...] "Oh!" [...] said she, [...] "Ambulinia, my daughter, did you know what I have suffered--did you know how many nights I have whiled away in agony, in pain, and in fear, you would pity the sorrows of a heartbroken mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|Let me congratulate you, {{my dearest}} Mother! The affair which {{has given us}} so much anxiety is drawing to a happy conclusion. Our {{prospect}} is most delightful, and since matters have now taken so favourable a turn, I am quite sorry that I ever imparted my apprehensions to you; {{for the pleasure of}} learning that the danger is over is perhaps dearly purchased by all that you have previously suffered. I am so much agitated by delight that I can scarcely hold a pen; but am determined to send you a few short lines by James, that you may have some explanation of what must so greatly astonish you, as that Reginald should be returning to Parklands. I was sitting about half an hour ago with Sir James in the breakfast parlour, when my brother called me out of the room. I instantly saw that something was the matter; his complexion was raised, and he spoke with great emotion; you know his eager manner, my dear mother, when his mind is interested. [...] "Catherine," [...] said he, [...] "I am going home to-day; I am sorry to leave you, but I must go: it is a great while since I have seen my father and mother. I am going to send James forward with my hunters immediately; if you have any letter, therefore, he can take it. I shall not be at home myself till Wednesday or Thursday, as I shall go through London, where I have business; but before I leave you," [...] he continued, speaking in a lower tone, and with still greater energy, [...] "I must warn you of one thing--do not let Frederica Vernon be made unhappy by that Martin. He wants to marry her; her mother promotes the match, but she cannot endure the idea of it. Be assured that I speak from the fullest conviction of the truth of what I say; I Know that Frederica is made wretched by Sir James's continuing here. She is a sweet girl, and deserves a better fate. Send him away immediately; he is only a fool: but what her mother can mean, Heaven only knows! Good bye," [...] he added, shaking my hand with earnestness; [...] "I do not know when you will see me again; but remember what I tell you of Frederica; you MUST make it your business to see justice done her. She is an amiable girl, and has a very superior mind to what we have given her credit for." [...] He then left me, and ran upstairs. I would not try to stop him, for I know what his feelings must be. The nature of mine, as I listened to him, I need not attempt to describe; {{for a minute or two}} I remained in the same spot, overpowered by wonder of a most agreeable sort indeed; yet it required some consideration to be tranquilly happy. In about ten minutes after my return to the parlour Lady Susan entered the room. I concluded, of course, that she and Reginald had been quarrelling; and looked with anxious curiosity for a confirmation of my belief in her face. Mistress of deceit, however, she appeared perfectly unconcerned, and after chatting on indifferent subjects for a short time, said to me, [...] "I find from Wilson that we are going to lose Mr. De Courcy--is it true that he leaves Churchhill this morning?" [...] I replied that it was. [...] "He told us nothing of all this last night," [...] said she, laughing, [...] "or even this morning at breakfast; but perhaps he did not know it himself. Young men are often <b>hasty</b> in their <b>resolutions,</b> and not more sudden in forming than unsteady in keeping them. I should not be surprised if he were to change his mind at last, and not go." [...] She soon afterwards left the room. I trust, however, my dear mother, that we have no reason to fear an alteration of his present plan; things have gone too far. They must have quarrelled, and about Frederica, too. Her calmness astonishes me. What delight will be yours in seeing him again; in seeing him still worthy your esteem, still capable of forming your happiness! When I next write I shall be able to tell you that Sir James is gone, Lady Susan vanquished, and Frederica at peace. We have much to do, but it shall be done. I am all impatience to hear how this astonishing change was effected. I finish as I began, with the warmest congratulations.|$|R
