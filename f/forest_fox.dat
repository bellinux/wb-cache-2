50|$|The {{crab-eating fox}} (Cerdocyon thous), {{also known as}} the <b>forest</b> <b>fox,</b> wood fox, or Maikong, is an extant species of {{medium-sized}} canid endemic to the central part of South America, and which appeared during the Pliocene epoch. Like South American foxes, which are in the genus Lycalopex, it is not closely related to true foxes: Cerdocyon comes from the Greek words kerdo (meaning fox) and cyon (dog) referring to the dog-and fox-like characteristics of this animal.|$|E

30|$|The mean fire {{interval}} (MFI), {{which is a}} common descriptor used to define fire frequency, has limited applications when calculated over large geographic extents. As a study area increases beyond a certain size, the MFI ceases to be an appropriate measure of frequency (Agee 1990) because of its inverse relationship to the sample unit size (Arno and Petersen 1983). In large landscapes consideration of {{the proportion of the}} area burned when calculating fire frequency may comparatively yield a more representative measure than that of a point frequency. For the 215, 000 ha area comprising the Boundary Waters Canoe area in Minnesota, the natural fire rotation (NFR) was developed as a measure of fire frequency (Heinselman 1973). A similarly large area, the 880, 000 ha of California’s redwood (Sequoia sempervirens) <b>forests</b> (<b>Fox</b> and Lee 1989) warrant the use of NFR as a measure of fire periodicity.|$|R

50|$|The Forest of Laye is a {{relic of}} the ancient Forest of Yveline. Very early it became a royal domain and hunting grounds of the Kings of France who resided at the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye. Henry IV and Louis XIII of France often used the <b>forest</b> for <b>fox</b> hunting. Louis XIV also walked the forest and hired an architect, André Le Nôtre, to build a terrace {{bordering}} the forest dominating the valley of the River Seine in 1663. He also built a high wall, finished by Napoléon, encircling the forest to prevent game from escaping the woods. After the abandonment of the forest of Saint-Germain in 1682 by Louis XIV, Charles X resumed the hunting tradition of Saint-Germain. Napoléon III purchased land to the South to link the forest of Saint-Germain with the Forest of Marly. The arrival of the railway in 1835, then the development of the car, considerably increased use of the forest.|$|R

50|$|The Lower Fox was {{developed}} instead {{as a center}} of riverfront industry. During the mid-19th century, when Wisconsin was a leading producer of wheat, several flour mills were built along the river to harness its abundant water power. During the 1860s, as Wisconsin's wheat production declined, these flour mills were replaced by {{a growing number of}} paper mills, which processed the great amount of timber being harvested from the <b>forests.</b> The Lower <b>Fox</b> proved an ideal location for paper production, owing to its proximity to lumbering areas that could supply wood pulp to make paper. Several well-known paper companies were founded in cities along the river, including Kimberly-Clark, Northern Paper Mills (makers of Quilted Northern), and the Hoberg Paper Company (manufacturer of Charmin).|$|R
50|$|Vantage Point is a 2008 American thriller film {{directed}} by Pete Travis; it {{was adapted from}} a screenplay written by Barry L. Levy. The story focuses on an assassination attempt on the President of the United States, {{as seen from the}} various vantage points of different characters. Dennis Quaid, Matthew <b>Fox,</b> <b>Forest</b> Whitaker, William Hurt, and Sigourney Weaver star in principal roles. The film is often compared, unfavorably, to Akira Kurosawa's Rashomon, which also employed storytelling through multiple perspectives. Rashomon used the multiple perspectives to question the possibility of truth, in a process called the Rashomon effect; in contrast, Vantage Point recounts a series of events which are re-enacted from several different perspectives and viewpoints in order to reveal a truthful account of what happened. Vantage Point also explores kidnapping, assassination and terrorism.|$|R
50|$|Dairy cows once grazed {{the hillsides}} {{of the area}} known today as Firestone Metro Park. In 1949, Metro Parks {{received}} a gift of 89 acres from the Firestone Tire and Rubber Company. Acquisitions of nearby parcels expanded the park to 258 acres. In 1956, the Ohio Department of Natural Resources completed construction of a nearby dam, intended to create a reservoir for industrial water needs. As the reservoir of the adjacent Firestone Golf Course filled, the water table rose downstream, forming the large wetland and marshy meadows of Firestone Metro Park. Along with the Tuscarawas River and Tuscarawas Race, which once channeled water to the Ohio & Erie Canal, the area is home to fish, crayfish, frogs and turtles. The meadows and <b>forest</b> shelter <b>foxes,</b> coyotes, raccoons, skunks, muskrats, rabbits, mice, voles and moles, along with many beautiful summer and fall wildflowers. More than 175 bird species have been sighted in Firestone Metro Park, including various types of wrens, thrushes, warblers, woodpeckers, herons and ducks. A number of different raptors - including bald eagles - have also been spotted. A note to visitors: Poison sumac {{is found in the}} wet areas of Firestone Metro Park. This small tree/shrub contains a powerful skin irritant, similar to that of poison ivy. To avoid it, stay on designated trails.|$|R

All current Livingstone’s fruit bat roosts are restricted to a narrow midaltitudinal range and are strongly associated {{with the presence of}} native and endemic trees, with the biggest roosts located in dense-canopy, old-growth <b>forest.</b> Livingstone’s flying <b>fox</b> appears to show a preference for roosting in certain tree species, in particular the endemic Nuxia pseudodentata and native Gambeya spp. and at forested sites that are typically found on steep slopes, next to valleys where permanent watercourses are present, and facing in a southeast direction and in depressions to provide protection from wind and the midday sun. Only 15 roost-sites are currently occupied in Anjouan and six at Moheli.|$|R
50|$|On the way home, Pinocchio {{meets the}} fox {{and the cat}} again, who have decided to trick Pinocchio.

Pinocchio doesn’t understand that they are trying to trick him, even though Pinocchio’s companion, Bella the duckling, tries to warn him. Pinocchio, who believes their lies, follows the fox and the cat towards the fields of wonder. They stop at an inn, where the cat and fox eat a full meal on Pinocchio’s expense. During the night, the inn keeper wakens Pinocchio, notifying him that the fox and cat had to leave urgently, but they would meet Pinocchio at the fields of wonder. Pinocchio sets out immediately towards the fields of wonder. When he passes through the <b>forest,</b> the <b>fox</b> and cat, who are dressed up as robbers, surprise attack him and try to rob Pinocchio. Pinocchio manages to run away into the forest. While running into the forest, Pinocchio meets the fairy with turquoise hair. Later on, the cat and the fox (who are still in disguise) manage to seize Pinocchio, and they hang him on a tree in order to retrieve the golden coins. Pinocchio holds on to the golden coins and, eventually, the fox and the cat decide to leave him hanging on the tree. The fairy with turquoise hair appears later on and rescues Pinocchio.|$|R
5000|$|The Wolf and the Fox is {{featured}} in Grimm's Fairy Tale Classics. There were some {{differences in the}} plot of this episode. In this version, the Wolf has had terrible hunting skills where {{he was unable to}} catch a deer, some rabbits, a family of ducks, and was repelled by a farmer when he tried to target the farmer's cattle. The Wolf has also tried to obtain some followers from a deer, a squirrel, a hawk, and a bear. The Fox ends up taking up the Wolf's previous offer to make him his follower which is where the Wolf makes the Fox obtain food for him. The first part involved fishing from a frozen pond during winter. The Wolf got his tail stuck in the ice which the Fox had to remove at the cost of part of the Wolf's tail. Then in the spring, Fox obtained a fried egg from a farmer's house. The Wolf tried to go for another, but broke one of the dishes giving himself away to the farmer's wife as the farmer beats up the Wolf. After talking with a deer, the Fox comes up with a plan where he takes the recuperated Wolf to a basement containing salted meat. To complete his trap {{to get rid of the}} Wolf, the Fox causes a racket to alert a local farmer and the Wolf gets stuck in the hole where he is caught by the farmer. The Fox continued to run and makes it back to the <b>forest.</b> The <b>Fox</b> tells the local animals that the Wolf isn't coming back and states that he is free of him.|$|R
