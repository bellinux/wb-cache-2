Diplo introduced the song's concept to Usher, who was working {{with him on a}} new album. Usher wanted to expand his music's style and depth by working with Diplo. Diplo recounted the experience in an interview for The Guardian, saying that [...] "I had explained to him about a moment I had with a girl where I felt like I could die with her and be content, but I didn't and life moved on, and that point in my life was over. It was a sad feeling but it was beautiful. He was relating with me about the idea and <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>you</b> think things are perfect and feel that way but they can pass." [...] They discussed the concept throughout the song's development and how it relates to Usher's life, as Diplo [...] "tried to help realise these lyrics and feelings." [...] After conceiving some melody lines, they wrote the song in about an hour.|$|E
500|$|... "Fearless" [...] {{was written}} by Swift in {{collaboration}} with Liz Rose and Hillary Lindsey and produced by Nathan Chapman alongside Swift. Swift conceived the song while touring as opening act {{in order to promote}} her eponymous debut album, Taylor Swift (2006). While writing the song, she was not dating anyone or [...] "even in the beginning stages of dating anybody." [...] She wrote the song after she analyzed the ideology of what was the best first date. While developing [...] "Fearless", Swift explained the writing process, stating, [...] "I think sometimes when you’re writing love songs, you don’t write them about what you’re going through at the moment, you write about what you wish you had." [...] The song was composed with two concepts in mind. Swift described the song's primary concept to be about [...] "the fearlessness of falling in love", and [...] "no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>you</b> get hurt, you will always fall in love again." [...] The second, is about the best first date, which Swift stated she hadn't experienced at the time of writing [...] "Fearless". After completing the song, Swift deeply deliberated her personal definition of the word [...] "fearless". To her, [...] "fearless doesn't mean you're completely unafraid and it doesn't mean that you're bulletproof. It means that {{you have a lot of}} fears, but you jump anyway." [...] That influenced her to title the album Fearless. The song was first released as a promotional single from the album on October 14, 2008 as part of Countdown to Fearless an exclusive campaign by the iTunes Store; it was later released as the fifth and final single from Fearless on January 4, 2010.|$|E

5000|$|In a 1996 Lecture in Sydney, {{referring}} to the work Zhuan Falun, Li stated: [...] "Although Qigong has been spread {{for quite a long}} period of time, several decades already, no one knows its real implications. Therefore, I have written in the book, Zhuan Falun, everything about certain phenomena in the Qigong community, why Qigong is spread in ordinary human society, and what the ultimate goal of Qigong is. Therefore, this book is a systematic work that enables one to practice cultivation. Through reading it repeatedly, many people feel that there is something unique about the book: no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have read this book, you always seem to feel a sense of freshness, and no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have read it, you always attain a different understanding from the same sentence, and no matter <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>times</b> <b>you</b> have read it, you always feel that there is still a great deal of content in it that is yet to be found. Why is it this way, then? It is because that I have systematically compiled many things that are considered heavenly secrets within this book, such as that people are able to practice cultivation, how cultivation should be practiced, and the characteristics of this universe, etc. For a practitioner, it can enable him to complete his cultivation practice successfully. Because no one has ever done such a thing in the past, when reading this book, many people find {{that a lot of the}} contents are heavenly secrets." ...|$|E
