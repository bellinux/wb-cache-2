5|$|NY18 was {{extended}} northeastward to Rochester {{as part of}} the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> the route's length. Instead of ending at the junction of Ohio and Main Streets (the latter then part of NY5) in downtown Buffalo, NY18 now overlapped with NY5 along Main Street north to Niagara Falls Boulevard, where it turned north and proceeded to Lake Ontario over NY34. At Youngstown, the route turned east, following a previously unnumbered alignment along the lakeshore to Rochester, where it ended at NY31 (now NY104) in Kodak Park. The route {{was extended}} further eastward to NY250 in Webster by the following year by way of East Ridge Road, Culver Road, and Lake Road. NY18 was never extended eastward past its junction with NY250.|$|E
5|$|However, {{with the}} war {{approaching}} a stalemate strategically, the Australians were substantially reinforced following the trend of further American troop increases, with a third infantry battalion arriving in December, while a squadron of Centurion tanks and additional Iroquois helicopters were added in early 1968. Total Australian strength in Vietnam grew to over 8,000 men, its highest level during the war, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> the combat power available to the task force commander. Likewise, American military strength in Vietnam had risen to 486,000 men while South Vietnamese forces had expanded to 643,000 {{by the end of}} the year. In spite of this build up North Vietnamese strength in South Vietnam also increased growing to 278,000 men, and although communist strategy remained fundamentally one of protracted war, preparations for a strategic offensive had reached an advanced stage. Culminating in the Tet Offensive in early 1968, the offensive would aim to provoke a popular general uprising among the South Vietnamese people against the government and its American supporters and would take the form of a massive simultaneous surprise attack on population centres throughout South Vietnam. 1 ATF would be heavily involved in the fighting during Tet, deploying astride communist lines of communication in support of American and South Vietnamese forces defending the Long Binh-Bien Hoa complex north-east of Saigon during Operation Coburg, while also repelling repeated Viet Cong attacks against Ba Ria and Long Dien in Phuoc Tuy province.|$|E
5|$|The inner ward {{was created}} during Richard the Lionheart's reign, when a moat was dug {{to the west}} of the {{innermost}} ward, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> the castle's size. HenryIII created the ward's east and north walls, and the ward's dimensions remain to this day. Most of Henry's work survives, and only two of the nine towers he constructed have been completely rebuilt. Between the Wakefield and Lanthorn Towers, the innermost ward's wall also serves as a curtain wall for the inner ward. The main entrance to the inner ward would have been through a gatehouse, most likely in the west wall on the site of what is now Beauchamp Tower. The inner ward's western curtain wall was rebuilt by EdwardI. The 13th-century Beauchamp Tower marks the first large-scale use of brick as a building material in Britain, since the 5th-century departure of the Romans. The Beauchamp Tower is one of 13towers that stud the curtain wall. Anti-clockwise from the south-west corner they are: Bell, Beauchamp, Devereux, Flint, Bowyer, Brick, Martin, Constable, Broad Arrow, Salt, Lanthorn, Wakefield, and the Bloody Tower. While these towers provided positions from which flanking fire could be deployed against a potential enemy, they also contained accommodation. As its name suggests, Bell Tower housed a belfry, its purpose to raise the alarm in the event of an attack. The royal bow-maker, responsible for making longbows, crossbows, catapults, and other siege and hand weapons, had a workshop in the Bowyer Tower. A turret at the top of Lanthorn Tower was used as a beacon by traffic approaching the Tower at night.|$|E

25|$|Unlike Melbourne, Ballarat {{does not}} have a defined urban growth boundary. This has put {{continuing}} pressure on the city council to approve development applications for subdivisions outside of the city fringe. In response to lobbying by landholders, the Ballarat West Growth Area Plan, a major greenfield land development plan, was prepared and has approved by the city and state government to allow for planned fringe communities consisting of 14,000 new homes and up to 40,000 new residents, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> the city's urban area by extending the urban sprawl from Sebastopol, Delacombe and Alfredton west toward Bonshaw, Smythes Creek and Cardigan with a new suburb to be known as Lucas to be created. New activity centres are to be developed at Delacombe and Alfredton.|$|E

At the time of the merger, Chemical Corn was the fourth largest bank in New York and New York Trust was the ninth largest bank and the merger created the third largest bank in New York, and the fourth largest in the U.S. with $3.8 billion of assets.

500|$|Phnom Penh Khmer {{is spoken}} {{in the capital}} and {{surrounding}} areas. This dialect is characterized by merging or complete elision of syllables, considered by speakers from other regions to be a [...] "relaxed" [...] pronunciation. For instance, [...] "Phnom Penh" [...] will sometimes be shortened to [...] "m'Penh". Another characteristic of Phnom Penh speech is observed in words with an [...] "r" [...] either as an initial consonant or as the second member of a consonant cluster (as in the English word [...] "bread"). The [...] "r", trilled or flapped in other dialects, is either pronounced as a uvular trill or not pronounced at all. This alters the quality of any preceding consonant, causing a harder, more emphasized pronunciation. Another unique {{result is that the}} syllable is spoken with a low-rising or [...] "dipping" [...] tone much like the [...] "hỏi" [...] tone in Vietnamese. For example, some people pronounce [...] ('fish') as : the [...] is dropped and the vowel begins by dipping much lower in tone than standard speech and then rises, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> its length. Another example is the word [...] ('study'), which is pronounced , with the uvular [...] "r" [...] and the same intonation described above.|$|E
500|$|Joffre {{found his}} new command difficult; {{while he was}} able to dismiss army commanders at will (he [...] 54 generals {{by the time of the}} First Battle of the Marne) he seemed unable to remove {{officers}} from GQG. [...] The reasons for Joffre's lack of action are unknown but historian Alistair Horne speculated that it was due to the vast power granted to the GQG staff or to Joffre's desire not to be upstaged by his staff. [...] The GQG officers, isolated from the direct effects of the war, engaged in intrigue on a grand scale and there was little co-operation between the rival departments. [...] The Second Bureau was often incapable of estimating the strength of the German forces committed to action. [...] At the start of the war it took until 24 August for the Second Bureau to realise that each German army corps deployed alongside a correspondingly numbered reserve corps, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> the strength of that corps in the field. [...] Throughout the war it maintained an inadequate means of calculating German casualty figures, simply assuming that for each two Frenchmen killed in battle three Germans must have fallen. [...] In reality the figures were almost the reverse. [...] By means of such estimations they calculated that Germany would run out of manpower reserves by early 1916. [...] Thus the Third Bureau found itself directing French generals to undertake military operations based on wholly inaccurate assessments of the strength of opposing units.|$|E

[...] Oakwood, which developed alongside the Southern Railway's Coster rail yard, incorporated in 1913.

2500|$|Debuting {{with sales}} of 12,500 (around the [...] "break even" [...] mark for a color comic, {{although}} [...] "like ten thousand more" [...] than Bendis' previous book, Torso), Powers was faced with an uncertain future, as sales of comics tend to dwindle over subsequent issues. However, Image Comics publisher Jim Valentino and head of marketing Anthony Bozzi both read and enjoyed the first three issues (lettered and laid out by Bendis himself, a hang-over from his earlier fully creator-owned works where he took on the complete roles of several individuals), with Bozzi reportedly saying, [...] "If we can't make a book like POWERS sell we really should stop making comics." [...] Image offered to double-ship the second issue, <b>effectively</b> <b>doubling</b> the orders for that issue {{as an attempt to}} boost sales: the gamble worked, and issue #1 was soon reprinted, while according to Bendis, [...] "issues #3–11 saw an upswing" [...] in sales every issue. The reported Diamond pre-order figures show sales climbing above 23,000 by issue #7, and topping 30,000 with issue #14 and stabilizing between 25,000 and 30,000 {{for the remainder of the}} titles' Image run. [...] These strong sales allowed Oeming to quit his job as a security guard, while Bendis' launch of Ultimate Spider-Man had a positive effect on Powers sales as readers searched out his comics.|$|E
