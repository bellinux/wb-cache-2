40|$|The {{success of}} <b>Fc-fusion</b> bio-therapeutics has spurred the {{development}} of other <b>Fc-fusion</b> products for treating and/or vaccinating against a range of diseases. We describe a method to modulate their function by converting them into well-defined stable polymers. This strategy resulted in cylindrical hexameric structures revealed by tapping mode atomic force microscopy (AFM). Polymeric Fc-fusions were significantly less immunogenic than their dimeric or monomeric counterparts, a result partly owing to their reduced ability to interact with critical Fc-receptors. However, {{in the absence of}} the fusion partner, polymeric IgG 1 -Fc molecules were capable of binding selectively to FcγRs, with significantly increased affinity owing to their increased valency, suggesting that these reagents may prove of immediate utility in {{the development of}} well-defined replacements for intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) therapy. Overall, these findings establish an effective IgG <b>Fc-fusion</b> based polymeric platform with which the therapeutic and vaccination applications of <b>Fc-fusion</b> immune-complexes can now be explored...|$|E
30|$|The shorter {{half-life}} of an <b>Fc-fusion</b> molecule {{in comparison}} to the whole IgG has been attributed to the lower binding affinity to FcRn, the glycan mediated disposition and the receptor (of fusion partner) mediated disposition (Liu, 2015). Among these attributes, glycosylation patterns may play a more important role in determining the in vivo clearance of <b>Fc-fusion</b> molecules. For example, in the investigation of humanized yeast-produced TNFαRII-Fc-fusion molecules, it was demonstrated that it was the extent of sialylation on the TNFRII, not the FcRn-binding affinity, which determined the clearance. The exposure was positively correlated to the quantity of the sialylation on the receptor molecule, with higher sialic acid content resulting in higher exposure (Liu et al., 2013).|$|E
40|$|Since {{the first}} {{description}} in 1989 of CD 4 -Fc-fusion antagonists that inhibit human immune deficiency virus entry into T cells, <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins have been intensely investigated for their effectiveness to curb {{a range of}} pathologies, with several notable recent successes coming to market. These promising outcomes have stimulated the development of novel approaches to improve their efficacy and safety, while also broadening their clinical remit to other uses such as vaccines and intravenous immunoglobulin therapy. This increased attention has also led to non-clinical applications of Fc-fusions, such as affinity reagents in microarray devices.

30|$|This {{review article}} {{discusses}} current understanding of PK of therapeutic mAb and <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins. As {{a large and}} polar molecule, mAb and <b>Fc-fusion</b> molecules have PKs that are substantially {{different from that of}} small molecule drugs. FcRn mediated recycling is the primary determinant of an IgG antibody’s PK properties. Through Fab and/or Fc engineering, IgG-FcRn interactions can be used to generate a variety of therapeutic antibodies with significantly enhanced half-life or the ability to remove unwanted antigen from circulation (sweeping antibody). Glycosylation on mAb or <b>Fc-fusion</b> protein can {{have a significant impact on}} the PK of these molecules. High mannose content is a liability for mAb and sialic acids are beneficial to <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins. mAb charge can also be important. Variation of pI values by 1 – 2 units is likely to impact PK, with lower pI values being favorable. In contrast to small molecule drugs, most mAbs display TMDD. This can have significant consequences on study design (both pre-clinical and clinical), in particular on dose selection, dosing scheme, and sampling times. The PK of mAb can also be influenced by anti-drug antibody (ADA) response and off-target binding, which require careful consideration during the discovery stage. mAb is primarily absorbed through the lymphatic system and can be conveniently administered by sc dosing. Large doses or volumes can be administered with hyaluronidase co-formulation. mAb slowly distributes to the interstitial space of tissues via convection. This results in a tissue to blood ratio ranging from 0.1 – 0.5, although the value can be significantly higher than 1 with mAb showing high-affinity and high-capacity binding in tissues. PK parameters of mAb with linear PK (above the target saturation dose) in humans can be reasonably predicted by using data from cynomolgus monkeys and an allometric exponent of ~ 0.85. Combination of several methods such as NOAEL and MABEL should be considered for prediction of FIH starting dose. In some situation, fixed dose is possible in humans if body size and weight do not contribute significantly to PK variability.|$|E

Blockade of chemokine activity is therefore an attractive target for anti-inflammatory therapy. 35 K (vCCI) is a high-affinity chemokine binding protein expressed by poxviruses, which binds all human and murine CC chemokines, preventing their interaction with chemokine receptors. We developed an <b>Fc-fusion</b> protein of 35 K with a modified human IgG 1 Fc domain and expressed this construct in human embryonic kidney 293 T cells. Purified 35 K-Fc is capable of inhibiting CC chemokine-induced calcium flux, chemotaxis, and β-arrestin recruitment in primary macrophages and transfected cells. To elucidate the residues involved in chemokine neutralization, we performed site-directed mutagenesis of six key amino acids in 35 K and expressed the mutant <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins in vitro. We screened the mutants {{for their ability to}} block chemokine-induced β-arrestin recruitment in transfected cells and to inhibit primary macrophage signaling in an electric cell substrate impedance sensing assay. Using a sterile model of acute inflammation, zymosan-induced peritonitis, we confirmed that wild-type 35 K-Fc can reduce monocyte recruitment, whereas one mutant (R 89 A) showed a more pronounced blockade of monocyte influx and another mutant (E 143 K) showed total loss of function. We believe that 35 K-Fc will be a useful tool for exploring the role of CC chemokines in chronic inflammatory pathologies, and we have identified a higher potency form of the molecule that may have potential therapeutic applications in chronic inflammatory disease...|$|E
30|$|Like natural IgGs, all {{approved}} recombinant therapeutic mAbs are glycosylated, {{although some}} non-glycosylated mAbs or derivatives are in clinical development (Liu, 2015).

Some therapeutic mAbs also bear additional glycosylation in the Fab domain. For instance, cetuximab is glycosylated at Asn 88 of the VH region (Jefferis, 2009 b). In addition, some of the <b>Fc-fusion</b> partner molecules, such as etanercept and B cell activating factor receptor 3 (BR 3)-Fc, also possess O-linked glycans (Pennica et al., 1993; Stefanich et al., 2008).|$|E

A similarly selected anti-cynomolgus CD 40 dAb recognizing the homologous epitope is also a potent antagonist. Mutagenesis, biochemical, and X-ray crystallography studies demonstrate that the epitope is distinct from that of CD 40 agonists.

Virus-infected cells that specifically bound a ligand of choice were isolated using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). Replication-competent, infective SIN replicon particles harboring the corresponding cDNA were amplified in a next step.

40|$|Research {{towards the}} {{development}} of malaria vaccines has been pursued since the 1960 s, but still there is no licensed malaria vaccine available yet. This PhD thesis entitled “Malaria Immunoassemblins – A novel combinatorial vaccine approach against Plasmodium falciparum based on highly improved <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins” aimed at overcoming challenges and limitations in malaria vaccine development that are deriving from the complex parasite life-cycle and the high antigenic diversity, while expanding mainstream <b>Fc-fusion</b> technology to develop new strategies for making complex multi-stage and multi-component subunit vaccines. By using the Agrobacterium-based transient expression platform, N. benthamina plants were utilized as green factories for recombinant fusion proteins. Malaria antigens and fusion proteins thereof, were N- and C-terminally fused to the human IgG 1 constant domain (CH 1 -hinge-CH 2 -CH 3), and upstream the human kappa light chain (CL), to benefit from natural heavy and light chain assembly. Additional, engineered heavy chain units were generated to further enable hetero-dimerization between heavy chain units. Successfully generated fusion proteins were named malaria immunoassemblins, or MIAs in short, to distinguish them from prior art immunoadhesins. More than 40 MIA pairs were produced, purified by protein-A chromatography, and efficiently assembled into IgG-like hetero-multimeric proteins. Malaria antigens reacted with specific monoclonal antibodies and immunized mice mounted high and balanced responses against each single component, including antigens that by themselves are only poorly immunogenic. The MIA approach was also successfully translated to endosperm specific expression in transgenic barley. Based on expression performance (i. e. yield and integrity) and immunological relevance, a single MIA vaccine candidate, ARC 25, was produced and used to immunize rabbits. It was highly immunogenic and comprised native epitopes, as anti-ARC 25 sera successfully immuno-labelled sporozoites and merozoites. Analysis of stage-specific ARC 25 performance revealed low effectivity against the pre-eryhtocytic stage (22 - 26 %), moderate efficiency towards the blood-stage (44 %), and high sexual-stage transmission blocking activity (92 %). Taken together, the MIA approach was successfully established for transient and transgenic production, and demonstrated promising results for further investigation as a platform for multi-component, multi-stage subunit vaccine candidates...|$|E

A gradient-based optimization routine is carried out to establish the optimal loading conditions (initial and final flowrates and switching time). The two-step loading strategy (using a higher flowrate during the initial stages followed by a lower flowrate) was evaluated for an <b>Fc-fusion</b> protein and was found to result in significant improvements in process throughput.

40|$|Mucosal {{secretions}} of {{the human}} gastrointestinal, respiratory, and genital tracts contain the immunoglobulins (Ig) G and secretory IgA (sIgA) that function together in host defense. Exactly how IgG crosses epithelial barriers to function in mucosal immunity remains unknown. Here, we test {{the idea that the}} MHC class I–related Fc-receptor, FcRn, transports IgG across the mucosal surface {{of the human}} and mouse lung from lumen to serosa. We find that bronchial epithelial cells of the human, nonhuman primate, and mouse, express FcRn in adult-life, and demonstrate FcRn-dependent absorption of a bioactive <b>Fc-fusion</b> protein across the respiratory epithelium of the mouse in vivo. Thus, IgG, like dimeric IgA, can cross epithelial barriers by receptor-mediated transcytosis in adult animals.

40|$|Protein A (ProA) {{chromatography}} is a bioseparations technique employed {{throughout the}} biopharmaceutical industry for the selective capture and purification of IgG-class monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins. The {{rapid growth of}} mAbs as commercial therapeutics has motivated the need for improved, efficient, and high-throughput purification processes during manufacturing. In direct response, the work presented in thesis aims to 1) increase the scientific community’s understanding of IgG adsorption behavior on ProA chromatography resins and 2) improve the performance of ProA chromatography with ligands that are chemically modified using polyethylene glycol (PEGylated). The results of this thesis suggest that IgG molecules of varying binding strength, or varying elution pH, are capable of competing for binding sites on ProA chromatography resins in simultaneous or sequential adsorption. The competitive phenomenon derives from variance in IgG binding strength, or IgG elution pH, {{due to differences in}} sub-class behavior as well as secondary IgG binding interactions with the ProA ligand. Competition is readily apparent in the adsorption of human polyclonal IgG, which has a wide variety of IgG sub-classes and binding epitopes. Additionally, the results presented in this thesis suggest that ProA chromatography resins with PEGylated ligands are a viable path to increase resin robustness and real-world chromatographic selectivity. It is demonstrated that ligand PEGylation can increase resistance to proteolytic digestion, mitigate impurity interactions with mAbs that are bound to ProA, and increase process selectivity against Chinese Hamster Ovary host cell proteins by up to 37 %. However, resins with large volumes of conjugated PEG significantly decrease IgG static binding capacity and decrease the available pore space for diffusion, resulting in losses in dynamic binding capacity and productivity. Lighter modifications appear to avoid losses in dynamic binding capacity, however, they {{do not appear to be}} effective at mitigating impurity interactions with mAbs that are bound to ProA, which is key to increasing process selectivity. PEGylation of ProA also universally increases the elution pH of IgG molecules by weakening the binding interaction. This last result opens another path of viability for PEGylated ProA ligands for purification of mAbs of <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins that are sensitive to low pH environments...|$|E

Partial cleaving of expressed protein initiated early on in cell culture and was observed to increase over time in culture and also on storage. In this study, a few parameters were explored in a bid to inhibit clipping in the fusion protein The effects of culture temperature, duration of culture, the addition of an anti-clumping agent, ferric citrate and use of protease inhibitor cocktail on inhibition of proteolysis of the Fc fusion were studied. Lowering of culture temperature from 37 to 30 °C alone appears to be the best solution for reducing protein degradation from the quality, cost and regulatory points of view.

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations provides insight into the mechanisms of hexa-Fc interaction with these receptors and reveals an unexpected orientation of high-mannose glycans on the human Fc that provides greater accessibility to potential binding partners.

30|$|The {{ground-breaking}} {{discovery of}} monoclonal antibody (mAb) technology by Kohler and Milstein in 1975 provided {{the possibility of}} creating antibodies as a class of therapeutics (Kohler & Milstein, 1975). The original obstacles of immunogenicity of murine mAbs in humans was overcome by the revolution in molecular biology in the 1980 s, which enabled humanization of murine antibodies and, eventually, the successful development of fully humanized antibodies. Humanization greatly reduces a therapeutic antibody’s immunogenicity in humans, making chronic administration possible. Such advances in antibody technologies have resulted in {{an explosion in the}} development of therapeutic mAbs over the last decade. Today, more than 47 mAbs and derivative drugs have been approved for human use with many of them attaining blockbuster status (Ecker et al., 2015). Among the top ten selling drugs in 2014, five were monoclonal antibodies and one was an Fc fusion molecule, with each having an annual revenue over 6.5 billion US dollars (Nisen, 2015). It is estimated that in the near future, about 30 % of the new drugs will be antibodies or antibody derivatives (Elvin et al., 2013).

40|$|AbstractExposure {{of three}} native IgG 1 {{monoclonal}} antibodies to 100 mM acetate, pH 3. 5 had no {{significant effect on}} their hydrodynamic size (11. 5 ± 0. 5 nm), while elution from protein A with the same buffer created a conformation of 5. 5 ± 1. 0 nm. Formation of the reduced-size conformation was preceded by the known destabilization of the second constant domain of the heavy chain (Cγ 2) by contact with protein A, then compounded by exposure to low pH, creating extended flexibility in the hinge-Cγ 2 region and allowing the Fab region to fold over the Fc region. The reduced-size conformation was necessary for complete elution. It persisted unchanged for at least 7 days under elution conditions. Physiological conditions restored native size, and it was maintained on re-exposure to 100 mM acetate, pH 3. 5. Protein A-mediated destabilization and subsequent restoration of native size did not create aggregates, but the reduced-size conformation was more susceptible to aggregation by secondary stress than native antibody. Protein A-mediated formation of the reduced-size conformation is probably universal during purification of human IgG 1 antibodies, and may occur with other subclasses and IgG from other species, as well as <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins...|$|E

Regulatory requirements for the final product include the removal of host cell proteins (HCPs) to acceptable amounts (< 100 ppm). Recent research has begun to unravel the extent to which upstream process conditions and subsequent product recovery and purification processes impact upon the HCP profile. A number of upstream parameters, including the selection of the cell line, the culturing process (e. g. feeding regime, culture temperature), cell viability at time of harvest/culture duration and cell shear sensitivity can all influence the resulting HCP profile. Further, the molecule itself {{plays an important role in}} determining those HCPs that are retained throughout a bioprocess and HCPs can co-elute with the target product during purification. Measurement and monitoring of HCPs is usually undertaken using ELISA technology, however alternative approaches are also now emerging that complement ELISA and allow the detection, identification and monitoring of specific HCPs.

The {{aim of this study}} was to deter-mine the effect of fucose removal on the effector function of another class of clinically important molecules that can effect cellular cytotoxicity, Fc fusion proteins. The recep-tors chosen for study were TNF receptor II and LFA- 3, both of which have therapeutic significance. The fucosylated versions of these fusion proteins were produced in unmo-dified CHO cells, whereas the nonfucosylated counterparts were produced in CHO cells with a- 1, 6 -fucosyltransferase, an enzyme required for fucosylation, knocked-out. Whilst binding activity of TNFRII-Fc and LFA- 3 -Fc were unchanged by fucose-removal, nonfucosylated Fc fusion proteins exhibited significantly higher Fc receptor cIIIa–binding and increased Fc-mediated cytotoxicity on target cells compared to fuco-sylated counterparts. Notably, in case of TNFRII-Fc, only the nonfucosylated protein exhibited potent Fc dependent cytotoxicity to transmembrane TNF-a expressing cells. These results prove that enhancement of Fc dependent cellular cytotoxicity by fucose-removal is effective in not only whole IgG but also Fc fusion proteins, and thus widens the potential of <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins as therapeutic candidates...|$|E

In recent years, engineered Fc-derived antibody domains have also shown potential for Fc-based therapeutics.

The desired result is that we can simultaneously obtain Fc variants with increased physicochemical properties in vitro and capacity of mediating appropriate functions in vivo. However, changes of physicochemical properties of Fc may result in alternation of Fc-mediated functions and vice versa, which leads to undesired outcomes for further development of Fc-based therapeutics. Therefore, whether modified Fc fragments are suitable for achievement of expected clinical results or not needs to be seriously considered.

40|$|Monoclonal IgG {{antibodies}} (Abs) {{are used}} {{extensively in the}} clinic to treat cancer and autoimmune diseases. In addition, therapeutic proteins are genetically fused to the constant Fc part of IgG. In both cases, the Fc secures a long serum half-life and favourable pharmacokinetics due to its pH-dependent interaction with the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn). FcRn also mediates transport of intact IgG across polarized epithelial barriers, a pathway that is attractive for delivery of Fc-containing therapeutics. So far, no study has thoroughly compared side-by-side how IgG and different <b>Fc-fusion</b> formats are transported across human polarizing epithelial cells. Here, we used an in vitro cellular transport assay based on the human polarizing epithelial cell line (T 84) in which both IgG 1 and Fc-fusions were transported in an FcRn-dependent manner. Furthermore, {{we found that the}} efficacy of transport was dependent on the format. We demonstrate that transepithelial delivery could be enhanced by Fc-engineering for improved FcRn binding as well as by Fc-polymerization. In both cases, transport was driven by pH-dependent binding kinetics and the pH at the luminal side. Hence, efficient transcellular delivery of IgG-based drugs across human epithelial cells requires optimal pH-dependent FcRn binding that can be manipulated by avidity and Fc-engineering, factors that should inspire the design of future therapeutics targeted for transmucosal delivery...|$|E

Regardless of {{an increasing number}} of reported aptamers, the structural basis of the interaction of RNA aptamer with proteins is poorly understood. Here, we determined the 2. 15 [*]Å crystal structure of the Fc fragment of human IgG 1 (hFc 1) complexed with an anti-Fc RNA aptamer. The aptamer adopts a characteristic structure fit to hFc 1 that is stabilized by a calcium ion, and the binding activity of the aptamer can be controlled many times by calcium chelation and addition. Importantly, the aptamer–hFc 1 interaction involves mainly van der Waals contacts and hydrogen bonds rather than electrostatic forces, in contrast to other known aptamer–protein complexes. Moreover, the aptamer–hFc 1 interaction involves human IgG-specific amino acids, rendering the aptamer specific to human IgGs, and not crossreactive to other species IgGs. Hence, the aptamer is a potent alternative for protein A affinity purification of <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins and therapeutic antibodies. These results demonstrate, from a structural viewpoint, that conformational plasticity and selectivity of an RNA aptamer is achieved by multiple interactions other than electrostatic forces, which is applicable to many protein targets of low or no affinity to nucleic acids...|$|E

METHODS: Male mice were implanted with PC 3 cells by intratibial injection. Mice were randomized into three groups (n = 5 − 7 per group) to receive vehicle or 3 mg/kg Fc-OPG three times weekly from the week before cell injection (week- 1; early treatment), week 0 (simultaneous treatment) or week 2 (delayed treatment). RESULTS: When compared with vehicle-treated controls, Fc-OPG treatments pro-tected bone and reduced bone turnover marker levels. In early and simultaneous Fc-OPG treated mice, necrosis of bone-enclosed tumor and the adjacent endosteal bone was observed. No tissue or bone necrosis was seen in sham-injected or vehicle-treated controls or in the contralateral tibiae of Fc-OPG treated mice. CONCLUSION: The necrosis of bone-confined tumor in Fc-OPG-treated mice sug-gests that prolonged blockage of bone erosion during the early development of a tumor mass in bone can limit vascular supply, leading to necrosis. The loss of osteocyte viability was only seen adjacent to necrotic tumor, which suggests that this effect is not due to bone resorption inhibition per se but to interactions between inhibition of bone resorption and tumor effects...|$|E

ResultsWe found that misexpression of EphB 2 in embryonic NM precursors significantly {{increased the number of}} axon targeting errors from NM to contralateral NL in a cell-autonomous manner when forward signaling was impaired. We also tested the effects of inhibiting forward signaling of different Eph receptor subclasses by injecting soluble unclustered <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins at stages when NM axons are approaching their NL target. Again we found an increase in axon targeting errors compared to controls when forward signaling was impaired, an effect that was significantly increased when both Eph receptor subclasses were inhibited together. In addition to axon targeting errors, we also observed morphological abnormalities of the auditory nuclei when EphB 2 forward signaling was increased by E 2 transfection, and when Eph-ephrin forward signaling was inhibited by E 6 -E 8 injection of Eph receptor fusion proteins. ConclusionsThese data suggest that EphB signaling has distinct functions in axon guidance and morphogenesis. The results provide evidence that multiple Eph receptors work synergistically in the formation of precise auditory circuitry...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT The TAM {{receptor}} protein tyrosine kinases Tyro 3, Axl, and Mer play {{important roles}} in macrophage function. We investigated {{the roles of the}} TAM receptors in mediating the induction of hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) during the interaction of macrophages with apoptotic cells. Mer-specific neutralizing antibody, small interfering RNA (siRNA), and a re-combinant Mer protein (Mer/Fc) inhibited HGF mRNA and protein expression, as well as ac-tivation of RhoA, Akt, and specific mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinases in response to apoptotic cells. Inhibition of Axl or Tyro 3 with specific antibodies, siRNA, or <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins did not prevent apoptotic cell–induced HGF mRNA and protein expression and did not in-hibit activation of the postreceptor signaling molecules RhoA and certain MAP kinases, in-cluding extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase and c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase. However, Axl- and Tyro 3 -specific blockers did inhibit the activation of Akt and p 38 MAP kinase in re-sponse to apoptotic cells. In addition, none of the TAM receptors mediated the effects of apoptotic cells on transforming growth factor-β or epidermal growth factor mRNA expres-sion. However, they were involved in the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor mRNA expression. Our data provide evidence that when macrophages interact with apop-totic cells, only Mer of the TAM-family receptors is responsible for mediating transcriptional HGF production through a RhoA-dependent pathway...|$|E
40|$|EphrinB 2 was {{recently}} discovered as a functional receptor for Nipah virus (NiV), a lethal emerging paramyxovirus. Ephrins constitute {{a class of}} homologous ligands for the Eph class of receptor tyrosine kinases and exhibit overlapping expression patterns. Thus, we examined whether other ephrins might serve as alternative receptors for NiV. Here, we show that of all known ephrins (ephrinA 1 –A 5 and ephrinB 1 –B 3), only the soluble <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins of ephrinB 3, in addition to ephrinB 2, bound to soluble NiV attachment protein G (NiV-G). Soluble NiV-G bound to cell surface ephrinB 3 and B 2 with subnanomolar affinities (K d 0. 58 nM and 0. 06 nM for ephrinB 3 and B 2, respectively). Surface plasmon resonance analysis indicated that the relatively lower affinity of NiV-G for ephrinB 3 was largely due to a faster off-rate (K off 1. 94 3 10 3 s 1 versus 1. 06 3 10 4 s 1 for ephrinB 3 and B 2, respectively). EphrinB 3 was sufficient to allow for viral entry of both pseudotype and live NiV. Soluble ephrinB 2 and B 3 were able to compete for NiV-envelope-mediated viral entry on both ephrinB 2 - and B 3 -expressing cells, suggesting that NiV-G interacts with both ephrinB 2 and B 3 via a...|$|E
40|$|Cartilaginous fishes are {{the oldest}} group {{in which an}} {{adaptive}} immune system based on immunoglobulin-superfamily members is found. This manuscript compares humoral immune function in small-spotted catshark (Scyliorhinus canicula) with that described for spiny dogfish (Squalus acanthias), {{another member of the}} Squalomorphi superorder, and nurse shark, the model for humoral immunity in elasmobranchs {{and a member of the}} Galeomorphi superorder. Although small-spotted catshark and nurse shark are separated by over 200 million years we found that immunoglobulin isoforms are well conserved between the two species. However, the plasma protein profile of small-spotted catshark was most similar to that of spiny dogfish, with low levels of pentameric IgM, and IgNAR present as a multimer in plasma rather than a monomer. We show that an antigen-specific monomeric IgM response, with a profile similar to that described previously for nurse sharks, can be raised in small-spotted catshark. Lacking polyclonal or monoclonal antibody reagents for detecting catshark IgNAR we investigated phage-display and recombinant <b>Fc-fusion</b> protein expression as alternative methods to look for an antigen-specific response for this isotype. However, we could find no evidence of an antigen-specific IgNAR in the animals tested using either of these techniques. Thus, unlike nurse sharks where antigen-specific monomeric IgM and IgNAR appear together, it seems there may be a temporal or complete 'uncoupling' of these isotypes during a humoral response in the small-spotted catshark...|$|E
40|$|The {{recognition}} of bacteria, viruses, fungi, and other microbes {{is controlled by}} host immune cells, which are equipped with many innate immunity receptors, such as Toll-like receptors, C-type lectin receptors, and immunoglobulin-like receptors. Our studies indicate that the immune modulating properties of many herbal drugs, for instance, the medicinal fungus Reishi (Ganoderma lucidum) and Cordyceps sinensis, {{could be attributed to}} their polysaccharide components. These polysaccharides specifically interact with and activate surface receptors involved in innate immunity. However, due to the complexity of polysaccharides and their various sources from medicinal fungi, quantitative analysis of medicinal polysaccharide extracts with regard to their functions represents a major challenge. To profile carbohydrate-immune receptor interactions, the extracellular domains of 17 receptors were cloned as <b>Fc-fusion</b> proteins, such that their interactions with immobilized polysaccharides could be probed in an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The results show that several innate immune receptors, including Dectin- 1, DC-SIGN, Langerin, Kupffer cell receptor, macrophage mannose receptor, TLR 2, and TLR 4, interact with the polysaccharide extracts from G. lucidum (GLPS). This analysis revealed distinct polysaccharide profiles from different sources of medicinal fungi, and the innate immune receptor-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay described here can serve as a high-throughput profiling method for the characterization and quality control of medicinal polysaccharides. It also provides a means to dissect the molecular mechanism of medicinal polysaccharide-induced immunomodulation events...|$|E
40|$|Toxoplasma gondii is an {{intracellular}} parasite that invades nucleated cells, causing toxoplasmosis in {{humans and animals}} worldwide. The extremely wide range of hosts susceptible to T. gondii {{is thought to be}} the result of interactions between T. gondii ligands and receptors on its target cells. In this study, a host cell-binding protein from T. gondii was characterized, and one of its receptors was identified. P 104 (GenBank Access. No. CAJ 20677) is 991 amino acids in length, containing a putative 26 amino acid signal peptide and 10 PAN/apple domains, and shows low homology to other identified PAN/apple domain-containing molecules. A 104 -kDa host cell-binding protein was detected in the T. gondii lysate. Immunofluorescence assays detected P 104 at the apical end of extracellular T. gondii. An <b>Fc-fusion</b> protein of the P 104 N-terminus, which contains two PAN/apple domains, showed strong affinity for the mammalian and insect cells evaluated. This binding was not related to protein-protein or protein-lipid interactions, but to a protein-glycosaminoglycan (GAG) interaction. Chondroitin sulfate (CS), a kind of GAG, was shown to be involved in adhesion of the Fc-P 104 N-terminus fusion protein to host cells. These results suggest that P 104, expressed at the apical end of the extracellular parasite, may function as a ligand in the attachment of T. gondii to CS or other receptors on the host cell, facilitating invasion by the parasite...|$|E
