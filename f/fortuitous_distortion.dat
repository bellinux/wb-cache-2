40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a mini radar system aimed at {{detecting}} small targets at the low latitude. The radar operates at Ku-band in the frequency modulated continuous wave (FMCW) mode with two receiving channels. The radar system has the characteristics of compactness, mobility, and low power consumption. This paper focuses on {{the implementation of the}} radar system, and the Block least mean square (Block LMS) algorithm is applied to minimize the <b>fortuitous</b> <b>distortion.</b> It is validated from a series of experiments that the track of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) can be easily distinguished with the radar system...|$|E
