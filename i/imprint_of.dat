50|$|Anfesta was {{originally}} described by Mikhail Fedonkin as a free-swimming scyphozoa-like medusa. The branched furrows on the fossil were interpreted as <b>imprints</b> <b>of</b> {{a system of}} internal radial canals, and the three oval ridges as <b>imprints</b> <b>of</b> gonads.|$|R
30|$|SDH {{mutations}} {{follow an}} autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. SDHD mutations are also subject to genomic <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> the maternal allele.

This may result in the disease skipping generations.|$|R

5|$|Ace, {{along with}} Ballantine Books, {{was one of}} the leading science fiction {{publishers}} for its first ten years of operation. With the death of owner A. A. Wyn in 1967, however, the company's fortunes began to decline. Two prominent editors, Donald A. Wollheim and Terry Carr, left in 1971, and in 1972 Ace was sold to Grosset & Dunlap. Despite financial troubles, there were further successes, particularly with the third Ace Science Fiction Specials series, for which Carr was the editor. Further mergers and acquisitions resulted in the company becoming a part of Berkley Books. Ace then became an <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> Penguin Group (USA).|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this study, 39 human {{hepatocellular}} carcinoma (HCC) tissues and 7 normal adult liver tissues were screened for heterozygous polymorphisms in IGF 2, H 19, and the differentially methylated region of H 19 (H 19 DMR) using PCR–RFLP and PCR sequencing. The <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> IGF 2 and H 19 was examined by RT-PCR–RFLP, while the methylation profile of H 19 DMR {{was detected by}} bisulfite sequencing from every informative sample. Of the informative HCC samples 47. 06 % (8 of 17) demonstrated a gain <b>of</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> IGF 2, and 21. 74 % (5 of 23) of the informative HCC samples demonstrated a loss <b>of</b> <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> H 19. Interestingly, we found three methylation profiles for H 19 DMR in the informative HCC samples: hyper-, medium-, and hypomethylated profiles. Furthermore, the hypomethylated and hypermethylated profiles were immediately associated with aberrant <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> IGF 2 and H 19...|$|R

In 1972, Ace was acquired by Grosset & Dunlap, and in 1982, Grosset & Dunlap was in turn acquired by G.P. Putnam's Sons. Ace was reputedly the only profitable element of the Grosset & Dunlap empire by this time. Ace soon became the science fiction <b>imprint</b> <b>of</b> its parent company.|$|E

25|$|The {{grouping}} <b>of</b> <b>imprinted</b> genes within clusters {{allows them}} to share common regulatory elements, such as non-coding RNAs and differentially methylated regions (DMRs). When these regulatory elements control the <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> one or more genes, they are known as imprinting control regions (ICR). The expression of non-coding RNAs, such as Air on mouse chromosome 17 and KCNQ1OT1 on human chromosome 11p15.5, {{have been shown to}} be essential for the <b>imprinting</b> <b>of</b> genes in their corresponding regions.|$|R
