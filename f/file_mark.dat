40|$|Complex {{networks}} are frequently characterized by metrics for which particular subgraphs are counted. One statistic from this category, which {{we refer to}} as motif-role fingerprints, differs from global subgraph counts in {{that the number of}} subgraphs in which each node participates is counted. As with global subgraph counts, it can be important to distinguish between motif-role fingerprints that are 'structural' (induced subgraphs) and 'functional' (partial subgraphs). Here we show mathematically that a vector of all functional motif-role fingerprints can readily be obtained from an arbitrary directed adjacency matrix, and then converted to structural motif-role fingerprints by multiplying that vector by a specific invertible conversion matrix. This result demonstrates that a unique structural motif-role fingerprint exists for any given functional motif-role fingerprint. We demonstrate a similar result for the cases of functional and structural motif-fingerprints without node roles, and global subgraph counts that form the basis of standard motif analysis. We also explicitly highlight that motif-role fingerprints are elemental to several popular metrics for quantifying the subgraph structure of directed complex networks, including motif distributions, directed clustering coefficient, and transitivity. The relationships between each of these metrics and motif-role fingerprints also suggest new subtypes of directed clustering coefficients and transitivities. Our results have potential utility in analyzing directed synaptic networks constructed from neuronal connectome data, such as in terms of centrality. Other potential applications include anomaly detection in networks, identification of similar networks and identification of similar nodes within networks. Matlab code for calculating all stated metrics following calculation of functional motif-role fingerprints is provided as S 1 Matlab <b>File.</b> <b>Mark</b> D.

5000|$|Almost all blades are decorated, {{although}} not all blades are decorated on the visible part of the blade. Once the blade is cool, and the mud is scraped off, the blade has designs and grooves cut into it. One {{of the most important}} markings on the sword is performed here: the file markings. These are cut into the tang (nakago), or the hilt-section of the blade, during shaping, where they will be covered by a tsuka or hilt later. The tang is never supposed to be cleaned: doing this can cut the value of the sword in half or more. The purpose is to show how well the blade steel ages. A number of different types of file markings are used, including horizontal, slanted, and checked, known as ichi-monji, ko-sujikai, sujikai, ō-sujikai, katte-agari, shinogi-kiri-sujikai, taka-no-ha, and gyaku-taka-no-ha. A grid of marks, from raking the file diagonally both ways across the tang, is called higaki, whereas specialized [...] "full dress" [...] <b>file</b> <b>marks</b> are called kesho-yasuri. Lastly, if the blade is very old, it may have been shaved instead of filed. This is called sensuki. While ornamental, these <b>file</b> <b>marks</b> also serve the purpose of providing an uneven surface which bites well into the hilt which fits over it, and is made from wood. It is this pressure fit for the most part that holds the hilt in place, while the mekugi pin serves as a secondary method and a safety.|$|R

40|$|The damaged/failed {{compressor}} stator and rotor blades of an aeroengine were analyzed. All the blades {{were found to}} have failed by fatigue. The fatigue cracks in the stator blades have initiated at the under cut of the leading edge hub.

In the case of rotor blades, fatigue cracks initiated from either side of the airfoil with multiple origins and propagated to form through thickness cracks.

Evidences suggest that tip rubbing with the casing would have caused excessive bending stresses on the blade resulting in fatigue crack initiation. ...|$|R

Concurrent with the development of these digital file formats, dramatic advances in home computing and the rapid expansion of the Internet mean that digital sound recordings can now be captured, processed, reproduced, distributed and stored entirely electronically, on a range of magnetic and optical recording media, and these can be distributed almost anywhere in the world, with no loss of fidelity, and crucially, without the need to first transfer these files to some form of permanent recording medium for shipment and sale.|$|R
