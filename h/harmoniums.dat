25|$|Traditional Icelandic {{music is}} {{strongly}} religious. Hymns, both religious and secular, are a particularly well-developed form of music, {{due to the}} scarcity of musical instruments throughout much of Iceland's history. Hallgrímur Pétursson wrote many Protestant hymns in the 17th century. Icelandic music was modernised in the 19th century, when Magnús Stephensen brought pipe organs, which were followed by <b>harmoniums.</b> Other vital traditions of Icelandic music are epic alliterative and rhyming ballads called rímur. Rímur are epic tales, usually a cappella, which {{can be traced back}} to skaldic poetry, using complex metaphors and elaborate rhyme schemes. The best known rímur poet of the 19th century was Sigurður Breiðfjörð (1798–1846). A modern revitalisation of the tradition began in 1929 with the formation of Iðunn.|$|E
500|$|Lennon {{adapted the}} lyric for [...] "Being for the Benefit of Mr. Kite!" [...] from an 1843 poster for Pablo Fanque's circus that he {{purchased}} at an antique shop in Kent {{on the day}} of filming the promotional film for [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". Womack views the track as an effective blending of a print source and music: [...] "The interpretive power of the mixed-media application accrues its meaning through the musical production with which the group imbues the Ur-text of the poster." [...] MacDonald notes Lennon's request for a [...] "fairground production wherein one could smell the sawdust", an atmosphere that Martin and Emerick attempted to create with a sound collage that comprised randomly assembled recordings of <b>harmoniums,</b> harmonicas and calliopes. MacDonald describes the song as [...] "a spontaneous expression of its author's playful hedonism". Everett thinks that the track's use of Edwardian imagery thematically links it with the album's opening number.|$|E
500|$|Grainger was {{a musical}} democrat; he {{believed}} that in a performance each player's role should be of equal importance. His elastic scoring technique was developed to enable groups of all sizes and combinations of instruments to give effective performances of his music. Experimentation is evident in Grainger's earliest works; irregular rhythms based on rapid changes of time signature were employed in Love Verses from [...] "The Song of Solomon" [...] (1899), and Train Music (1901), long before [...] Stravinsky adopted this practice. In search of specific sounds Grainger employed unconventional instruments and techniques: solovoxes, theremins, marimbas, musical glasses, <b>harmoniums,</b> banjos, and ukuleles. [...] In one early [...] concert of [...] folk music, Quilter and [...] Scott were conscripted as performers, to whistle various parts. [...] In [...] "Random Round" [...] (1912–14), inspired by the communal music-making [...] he had heard in the Pacific Islands on his second Australasian tour, Grainger introduced an element of chance into performances; [...] individual vocalists and instrumentalists could make random choices from a menu of variations. [...] This experiment in [...] "aleatory" [...] composition presaged by many decades the use of similar procedures by avant-garde composers such as Berio and Stockhausen.|$|E

500|$|Throughout his life, Sharpe took an {{interest}} in sport, as an active participant and as an organiser. At Cambridge, {{he was a member of}} the Lady Margaret Boat Club, and coxed the college boat. Back in Lancaster, he took up archery, joined the John O'Gaunt Bowmen, played cricket and coxed. In June 1841 he helped to found the Lancaster Lunesdale Cricket Club and the Lancaster Rowing Club. Sharpe was also an accomplished musician, and a member of the committee that organised the Lancaster Choral Society's first concert in September 1836. [...] The society thrived for a number of years, and for a time Sharpe was its conductor. By the beginning of 1837 he was a member of the Lancaster Literary, Scientific, and Natural History Society, giving a number of talks to the society, and eventually becoming a committee member. [...] That same year he became the secretary and treasurer of the Lancaster Institution for the Encouragement of the Fine Arts, and in April 1840 he joined the committee of Lancaster's Protestant Association. In 1842 he was part of a committee promoting congregational singing, and he gave an illustrated series of lectures on its history and merits. His love of music continued throughout his life, and included training choirs, composing hymn tunes, and manufacturing musical instruments similar to small <b>harmoniums.</b>|$|E
2500|$|In early 2007 Hopkins {{was invited}} by Eno, who was {{producing}} Coldplay's upcoming album Viva la Vida or Death and All His Friends, {{to join the}} band in the studio for a day. Hopkins ended up staying and contributing to the album for the next year, co-producing several tracks and playing organs, <b>harmoniums,</b> and other keyboard instruments on others. The intro to the track [...] "Violet Hill" [...] came from an improvisation with Hopkins and Davide Rossi, the album's string arranger. Throughout this period Hopkins was periodically creating his own solo tracks, and his song [...] "Light Through the Veins" [...] was adapted {{to serve as the}} introduction to the album's first track [...] "Life in Technicolor". [...] "Light Through the Veins" [...] was also picked by the band to serve as the backing for the track [...] "The Escapist", which is hidden {{at the end of the}} album. Viva la Vida was released in 2008, and won Best Rock Album at the 2009 Grammy Awards and became the best-selling album of 2008. Coldplay asked Hopkins to serve as the pre-show DJ and opening act for their 2008 world tour. Hopkins toured with the band for six months through England, the United States, and Japan. He performed at venues including Madison Square Garden and the London O2 Arena, with crowds as large as 20,000 people.|$|E

Then said Panurge, {{as well as he}} might for the chattering of his teeth: 'May I never drink if here come not the Coqcigrues!' and this saying and prophecy of his was true and inspired. But thereon the others began to mock, flout, and gird at Panurge for his cowardice.

6000|$|No {{historical}} {{problem has}} proved more perplexing to Englishmen than {{the nature of}} the differences between the various Kirks in Scotland. The Southron found that, whether he worshipped in a church of the Established Kirk ('The Auld Kirk'), of the Free Church, or of the United Presbyterian Church (the U.P.'s), it was all the same thing. The nature of the service was exactly similar, though sometimes the congregation stood at prayers, and sat when it sang; sometimes stood when it sang and knelt at prayer. Not one of the Kirks used a prescribed liturgy. I have been in a Free Kirk which had no pulpit; the pastor stood on a kind of raised platform, like a lecturer in a lecture-room, but that practice is unessential. The Kirks, if I mistake not, have different collections of hymns, which, till recent years, were contemned as 'things of human invention,' and therefore 'idolatrous.' But hymns are now in use, as also are organs, or <b>harmoniums,</b> or other musical instruments. Thus the faces of the Kirks are similar and sisterly: ...|$|E
5000|$|The last mass-producer of <b>harmoniums</b> in North America was the Estey company, which ceased {{manufacture}} in the mid-1950s; {{a couple}} of Italian companies continued into the 1970s. As the existing stock of instruments aged and spare parts became hard to find, more and more were either scrapped or sold. It was not uncommon for <b>harmoniums</b> to be [...] "modernised" [...] by having electric blowers fitted, often very unsympathetically.

50|$|Before {{the arrival}} of the <b>harmonium</b> in India, musicians used either a tambura or a {{specific}} pitch reference instrument, such as the nadaswaram, to produce the drone. Some forms of music such as Yakshagana used the pungi reedpipe as drone. After the Western small pump <b>harmonium</b> became popular, musicians would modify the <b>harmonium</b> to automatically produce the reference pitch. Typically, one would open up the cover and adjust the stop of the <b>harmonium</b> to produce a drone.|$|R

50|$|A popular usage is by {{followers}} of the Hindu and Sikh faiths, who use it to accompany their devotional songs (bhajan or kirtan).

The <b>harmonium</b> plays an integral part in Qawwali music. Almost all Qawwals use the <b>harmonium</b> as their sole musical accompaniment.
