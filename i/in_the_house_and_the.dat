25|$|The Government House Leader {{works on}} the government's behalf by {{negotiating}} with the House Leaders of the Opposition parties. This often includes discussion over timetables and may include concessions to demands by opposition parties to ensure quick passage of a bill or opposition support. The position is especially crucial during periods of minority government, when no party has a majority <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> government must rely on the support {{of one or more}} Opposition parties to not only pass its legislative agenda but remain in power. The holder of the position must be an expert in parliamentary procedure in order to argue points of order before the Speaker of the House of Commons as well as be a good strategist and tactician in order to outmanoeuvre the opposition parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden was}} located behind the house, {{or on the}} {{southern}} side. The garden was grown above a man-made level platform where {{there used to be}} a hill, and was exactly one acre (about 4000sqm) in area. A gravel path runs from the back of the house to the southern edge, and was twelve feet (3.7m) wide during Mason's time period, the same width as the central passage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> portico. Today, the path is narrower, crowded by boxwoods that are now about 250 years old. The path ends in an overlook extending out from the steep edge of the garden. From here, the Potomac river can be seen. The Gunston Hall museum website says that the view was more impressive during Mason's time, when the trees were cleared. The garden was most likely broken into four rectangles, with additional gravel paths running through and around it. To give the illusion from the house of all rectangles being the same size, the rectangles closer to the house were probably shorter than the rectangles farther away.|$|E

500|$|In 1693, {{the house}} was {{purchased}} by Nathaniel Wade and around this time the roof was raised and a floor added into the original hall house. In 1685, during the Monmouth Rebellion Wade supported James Scott, 1st Duke of Monmouth. After {{the defeat of the}} rebels at the Battle of Sedgemoor Wade was captured. Judge Jefferys condemned him to death at Taunton King James, interviewed him and granted a pardon after which Wade returned home to Nailsea. [...] On Wade's death in 1718 {{the house was}} bought by a London Barrister Christopher Appleby for £2,000. It was then sold to the Dowager Lady Coleraine and passed to her son-in-law a Dr Rogers. On the death of his wife the house became the property of her son in law Sir Robert Knight. From 1795 it had various owners including: Henry Cam Seymour, John Hugh Smyth Pigott in 1834, Reginald Rodbard in 1846, Thomas Todd Walters in 1865 and Henry John Mirehouse in 1874.

500|$|The {{accompanying}} {{music video}} for [...] "Don't Bother" [...] {{was directed by}} Jaume de Laiguana, who had previously collaborated with Shakira on the video for [...] "No", and was released on 15 November 2005. The video begins with a man parking his sports {{car in front of}} a house and proceeding to enter it. Shakira is seen lying on a bed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> man comes up and lies beside her, indicating that they are a couple. As soon as the man falls asleep, Shakira wakes up and lies atop the man and begins to caress him and bite and whisper in his ear a few times, although he does not wake up. Shakira takes the keys of the man's car and drives it to a wrecking yard. The video then interludes to scenes of Shakira sexually romancing the man in a shower. The scene then changes back to the wrecking yard, where Shakira begins playing a pink guitar. After the spoken bridge of the song, Shakira places her partner's car in a car crusher, which soon commences demolishing it. The man reacts in a similar manner to the car being crushed and begins experiencing continuous body jerks and spasms, indicating a connection between his car and his body. After the car is fully destroyed, Shakira leaves the man unconscious on the bed, exits the house, and begins walking on the street triumphantly. Shakira explained the usage of the car symbolism in the video, saying that [...] "A man's car is like an extension of their ego and their manhood. I thought this would be a video that would make women say, 'Yeah, yeah!' and it would make men feel".|$|E

2500|$|Big Brother is a {{game show}} in which a group of contestants, {{referred}} to as HouseGuests, live in a custom-built [...] "house" [...] (actually a set built on a CBS stage in Los Angeles, Stage 18 in recent editions), constantly under video surveillance.

This rule could be broken, however, {{in the event of}} a medical injury, a family emergency or death. The format of the series is mainly seen as a social experiment, and requires HouseGuests to interact with others who may have differing ideals, beliefs, and prejudices.

Though locked in the house, the HouseGuests are free to quit the game, though will not be allowed entry back into the house.
