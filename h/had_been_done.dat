5|$|Additional optical {{effects were}} {{provided}} by Visual Concept Engineering (VCE), a small effects company headed by Peter Kuran; Kuran had previously worked at ILM and left after finishing The Empire Strikes Back. VCE provided effects including phaser beams, the Enterprise reactor, additional sand on Ceti Alpha V, and an updated transporter effect. Meyer and the production staff were adamant about not using freeze frames for the transporter, as <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> in the original television series. Scenes were shot so that conversations would continue while characters were in mid-transport, {{although much of the}} matte work VCE created was discarded when the production decided not to have as much action during transports.|$|E

5|$|After leaving office, Talbot {{continued}} in public service, {{serving on the}} Health Committee of the Massachusetts State Board of Health, Lunacy, and Charity from 1880–84, holding {{the chair of the}} committee in 1880-82. As governor, Talbot had overseen the merger of the Board of Health, with the Board of Lunacy and Charity. Although this merger <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> ostensibly as a cost-saving measure, health care activists opposed it.

5|$|After {{their work}} with Black Uhuru and that group's line-up change, Sly and Robbie pursued more {{international}} music endeavors. They branched out into cross-genre experiments with a conceptual, ensemble-oriented approach, while developing a mentorship with record producer Bill Laswell, whom they met through Blackwell and by working on Mick Jagger's 1985 album She's the Boss. In 1985, they collaborated with Laswell on their album Language Barrier, which had guest contributions from Herbie Hancock, Bob Dylan, Afrika Bambaataa, and Manu DiBango. Its recording developed from a track the duo had revisited from their work on the soundtrack to the 1983 film Never Say Never Again. The track <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> with electronic drums at Compass Point Studios, but scrapped as a rhythm track for later use.|$|E
5|$|Another {{result of}} the coup was that the work that <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>done</b> by British {{intelligence}} with the anti-Axis government of Cvetković and Maček was lost. By supporting the coup plotters, the SOE undermined the balance in Yugoslav politics that had been achieved by the Cvetković–Maček Agreement. Serb nationalists supported and welcomed the coup because it ended Croatian autonomy under the Agreement and freed them to pursue a Greater Serbia agenda. The coup and its immediate aftermath {{also contributed to the}} paralysis within the Yugoslav government-in-exile {{during the rest of the}} war, due to ongoing disputes regarding the legitimacy of the Cvetković–Maček Agreement.|$|E
