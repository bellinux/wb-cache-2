40|$|The Equal Channel Angular Extrusion (ECAE) {{process is}} a {{promising}} technique for imparting large plastic deformation to materials without a resultant decrease in cross-sectional area. The die consists of two channels of equal cross section intersecting at an angle; the workpiece is placed in one channel and extruded into the other using a punch. In the present study, the suitability of this technique for processing of tubular specimen geometries has been investigated. Tubular specimens of an aluminum alloy were extruded to three passes through two processing routes using sand as a mandrel. The pressures required for extrusion were measured, and the mechanical properties of the extruded material were evaluated. The low extrusion pressures during ECAE of tubular specimens are due to {{the movement of the}} mandrel (sand) along with the specimen (drag friction acts {{in the same direction as}} the main punch force). On processing to three passes of ECAE (by <b>inducing</b> <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> of 0. 9), the tensile strength, yield strength, and hardness are improved, and elongation to failure (percent) decreased as expected. The process requires low forming loads while ensuring retention of specimen shape. It is also possible to impart further deformation to the specimen using the same die.

40|$|In {{southeast}} Karakorum (northwest Himalaya, Pakistan), kilometric size migmatitic domes were exhumed in {{a context}} of north-south shortening during Neogene times. The domes are characterized by a conical shape, and ductile deformation criteria indicate both radial expansion and extrusion of the migmatitic core relative to the surrounding gneisses. Most of the domes are aligned along the dextral, strike-slip Shigar fault that is parallel to the N 130 °E Karakorum fault. Along the Shigar fault, exhumation of the domes is mainly vertical with a slight dextral component. We propose that the high temperature exhumation of the domes is due to diapiric ascent of the molten mid-crust helped by the compressive regime. The localization of the initial diapir was controlled by crustal-scale vertical structures parallel to the Karakorum fault. The later stage of exhumation in mid to low temperature conditions was related to the uplift and erosion of the whole southeastern Karakorum by crustal-scale east-west folding. In south Tibet, the westward prolongation of south Karakorum, Neogene crustal melting is also supported by geophysical data and volcanism, but mid-crustal rocks have not been exhumed. This difference between the amount of exhumation in south Karakorum and south Tibet could be related to the transpressive context of south Karakorum <b>inducing</b> <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> partitioning between the N 130 °E faults and east-west folding.

40|$|Researchers at the NASA Glenn Research Center {{developed}} in-house {{a method}} to detect pressure fluctuations using a fiber-optic sensor and dynamic signal processing. This work was {{in support of the}} Intelligent Systems Controls and Operations project under NASA's Information Technology Base Research Program. We constructed an optical pressure sensor by attaching a fiber-optic Bragg grating to a flexible membrane and then adhering the membrane to one end of a small cylinder. The other end of the cylinder was left open and exposed to pressure variations from a pulsed air jet. These pressure variations flexed the membrane, <b>inducing</b> <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> in the fiber-optic grating. This strain was read out optically with a dynamic spectrometer to record changes in the wavelength of light reflected from the grating. The dynamic spectrometer was built in-house to detect very small wavelength shifts induced by the pressure fluctuations. The spectrometer is an unbalanced interferometer specifically designed for maximum sensitivity to wavelength shifts. An optimum pathlength difference, which was determined empirically, resulted in a 14 -percent sensitivity improvement over theoretically predicted path-length differences. This difference is suspected to be from uncertainty about the spectral power difference of the signal reflected from the Bragg grating. The figure shows the output of the dynamic spectrometer as the sensor was exposed to a nominally 2 -kPa peak-to-peak square-wave pressure fluctuation. Good tracking, sensitivity, and signal-to-noise ratios are evident even though the sensor was constructed as a proof-of-concept and was not optimized in any way. Therefore the fiber-optic Bragg grating, which is normally considered a good candidate as a strain or temperature sensor, also {{has been shown to be}} a good candidate for a dynamic pressure sensor...|$|E

Recently, a new approach to scale down Ge dot sizes to less than 15 nm in diameter has been reported [2 - 4]. Pre-deposition of a submonolayer carbon atom on Si substrate results in very small and high density Ge dots because carbon atoms <b>induce</b> <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> field at the interface [2 - 7].

40|$|Spin torque {{oscillator}} {{devices have}} presented themselves as an energy efficient method of generating microwave frequencies in recent years. These are devices which rely on giant magnetoresistance {{to create a}} device resistance which oscillates at microwave frequencies due to the microwave oscillation of a magnetically free layer in the device. A spin torque oscillator can be improved by using a vortex core oscillator as the magnetically free layer offering a narrower linewidth and greater synchronisation possibilities, {{at the expense of}} a lower power output. The desire to tune the frequency of oscillation of these devices {{has been the focus of}} a great deal of research in recent years and one promising avenue of investigation is to alter the frequency of oscillation by <b>inducing</b> <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> anisotropy in such a device by the use of a piezoelectric transducer. In order for the induced anisotropy to be large a material must be used which exhibits a strong magnetostrictive effect such as Fe 1 −xGax, a material which exhibits strong magnetostrictive properties without the need for rare earth elements. This thesis describes investigations into the magnetisation dynamics of nanostructures fabricated from magnetostrictive thin films of Fe 1 −xGax under conditions of in-plane uniaxial anisotropy induced by an applied stress. Chapter 4 describes investigations into the effects of altering the thickness of sputter grown Fe 1 -xGax films on the crystalline anisotropy of the films. It was found that the intrinsic magnetocrystalline uniaxial anisotropy within the films increased with film thickness. The cubic anisotropy was shown to be roughly constant with respect to film thickness except when the film was 20 nm thick when the cubic anisotropy of the sample was anomalously high. Investigations of the magnetostrictive properties of these materials revealed sputter grown thin films to exhibit similar magnetostrictive properties as bulk material and thin films grown by molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray analysis performed by Dr. P. Wadley and Prof. V. Holy failed to explain the relationships between film thickness and magnetocrystaline anisotropy observed in the samples, but suggested that the average grain size increases as the thickness of the film increases. Chapter 5 describes the results of time resolved XMCD PEEM measurements performed at the Diamond Light Source synchrotron facility performed in order to investigate the magnetisation dynamics within a series of Fe 1 −xGax squares. It was found that these squares demonstrated no significant response to an applied stress, probably due to strong shape anisotropy. Preliminary work to investigate Ni squares revealed that they do exhibit a strong response to stress. The dynamic response of the Ni squares was notsuccessfully measured however. Chapter 6 presents results of micromagnetic simulations performed to predict the effects of strain-induced anisotropy on magnetic square nanostructures fabricated from Fe 1 −xGax. Time resolved simulations demonstrated the ability of a strain induced anisotropy to modify the frequency of oscillation of the vortex core oscillations and the confined spin wave modes as well as the amplitude of the magnetic field pulse required to induce switching of the polarisation of the vortex core. The effects of size and uniaxial anisotropy on the spin wave modes within square devices was studied and an s shaped spin wave mode was shown to form in the presence of a uniaxial anisotropy...|$|E

If a magnetic field is applied to the material at an angle to an easy axis of magnetization, the material will tend to rearrange its structure so that an easy axis is aligned with the field to minimize the free energy of the system.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{investigate}} {{the impact of}} thoracic endovascular aortic repair (TEVAR) on longitudinal strain and assess aortic tensile properties {{in order to better}} understand complications associated with TEVAR. METHODS: Twenty fresh thoracic porcine aortas were harvested and connected to a mock circulatory loop driven by a centrifugal flow pump at body temperature. Length measurements were conducted before and after TEVAR through aortic marking, high-definition imaging and custom-developed software under physiological pressure conditions (i. e. between 100 and 180 mmHg with 20 mmHg increments). Longitudinal strain was derived from length amplitude divided by the baseline length at 100 mmHg. Three groups of stent-graft oversizing were created (0 - 9, 10 - 19 and 20 - 29 %). Finally, elastic properties of the aortic samples were assessed in both longitudinal and circumferential directions through uniaxial tensile testing. Longitudinal strain was compared before and after TEVAR, and stress-to-rupture was compared among specimens and locations. RESULTS: TEVAR <b>induced</b> <b>a</b> longitudinal <b>strain</b> decrease from 11. 9 to 5. 6 % (P< 0. 001) in the stented segments and <b>a</b> longitudinal <b>strain</b> mismatch between stented (5. 6 %) and non-stented segments (9. 1 %, P< 0. 001). Stent-graft oversizing did not affect the magnitude of strain reduction (P= 0. 77). Tensile testing showed that peak stress-to-rupture was lower for longitudinal (1. 4 ± 0. 4 MPa) than for circumferential fragments (2. 3 ± 0. 4 MPa, P< 0. 001). In addition, longitudinal fragments were more prone to rupture proximally than distally (P= 0. 01). CONCLUSIONS: This experimental study showed that TEVAR acutely stiffens the aorta in the longitudinal direction and thereby <b>induces</b> <b>a</b> <b>strain</b> mismatch, while tensile testing confirmed that longitudinal aortic fragments are most prone to rupture, particularly close to the arch. Such <b>an</b> acute <b>strain</b> mismatch of potentially vulnerable tissue might play a role in TEVAR-related complications, including retrograde dissection and aneurysm formation.
