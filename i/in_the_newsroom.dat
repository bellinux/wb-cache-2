According to Godwin, {{much of her time}} growing up was spent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newsroom,</b> where her mother worked. She also witnessed her mother's plays and novels being rejected. Godwin's autobiography creates the impression that much of her own writing was intended to accomplish the things her mother could not.

40|$|Abstract This is {{the first}} study of its kind about {{newsroom}} convergence and multi-skilled journalists in Saudi newspaper organisations and aimed {{to fill a gap}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> literature about this particular issue <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saudi context. The study investigated transformations, implications and consequences of technological convergence at four Saudi traditional newspaper organisations; Al-Madina, Alriyadh, Alyaum, and Alwatan. This thesis has explored the particular impacts of online journalistic production in traditional newspaper organisations to identify changes and perhaps challenges occurring <b>in</b> newspaper <b>newsrooms.</b> <b>The</b> study used <b>the</b> observation method <b>in</b> <b>the</b> four <b>newsrooms</b> and in-depth interviews with open ended questions with 60 professionals. The findings confirmed that there are ongoing transformations <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newsrooms.</b> Yet, these transformations are challenged by regulatory, business, and cultural forces. Alyaum was <b>the</b> only <b>newsroom</b> to introduce new integrated newsroom. Journalists are observing and using new communication technologies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> workplace. However, there are difficulties in this process such as tensions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newsrooms</b> and shortage of qualified and trained journalists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Saudi media market especially, multiskilled journalists. Despite embracing online and digital technology in news production and disruption, the four Saudi newspapers are still prioritising the traditional print side as it is generating more than 95...|$|R

25|$|There was {{a problem}} facing the crew <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newsroom,</b> however. There was no {{television}} camera in the studio {{at the time as}} the technical crew was working on it. Eventually the camera was retrieved and brought back to the newsroom. Because of the magnitude of the story and the continuous flow of information coming from various sources, time was of the essence and the camera would take at least twenty minutes to become operational under normal circumstances. The decision was made to dispatch Cronkite to the CBS Radio Network booth to report the events and play the audio over the television airwaves while the crew worked on the camera {{to see if they could}} get it set up quicker.|$|E

In 1993, Redford played what became {{one of his most}} popular and recognized roles, starring in Indecent Proposal as a millionaire businessman who tests a couple's morals; the film became one of the year's biggest hits.

25|$|The cast had {{continued}} to perform live while Cronkite's bulletins broke into the broadcast, unaware of the unfolding events in Dallas. ATWT then took another scheduled commercial break. The segment before the break {{would be the last}} anyone would see of any network's programming until Tuesday, November 26. During the commercial, the bumper slide interrupted the proceedings again and Cronkite updated the viewers on the situation in Dallas. This bulletin went into more detail than the other two, revealing that Kennedy {{had been shot in the}} head, Connally in the chest. Cronkite remained on the air for the next ten minutes, continuing to read bulletins as they were handed to him, and recapping the events as they were known. He also related a report given to reporters by Texas Congressman Albert Thomas that the President and Governor were still alive, the first indication of their condition. At 2:00 EST, with the top of the hour station break looming, Cronkite told the audience that there would be a brief pause so that all of CBS' affiliates, including those in the Mountain and Pacific time zones which were not on the same schedule, could join the network.

500|$|Gannett Company's 2013 {{acquisition}} of Belo was opposed by {{organizations such as}} the American Cable Association and Free Press, due to Gannett's plans to use LMAs and two shell companies owned by former Belo and Fisher Communications executives (respectively, Sander Media and Tucker Operating Co.) to dodge FCC newspaper cross-ownership restrictions in Louisville, Phoenix, Portland, Oregon and Tucson. Although Gannett contended that the arrangements were legal, Free Press president Craig Aaron stated that [...] "the FCC shouldn't let Gannett break the rules. Media consolidation results in fewer journalists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newsroom</b> and fewer opinions on the airwaves. Concentrating media outlets in the hands of just a few companies benefits only the companies themselves." [...] The deal would have given Gannett a virtual triopoly in Phoenix, consisting of its NBC station KPNX, independent station KTVK and CW affiliate KASW. In Tucson, Fox affiliate KMSB and MyNetworkTV affiliate KTTU were already operated by Raycom Media's CBS affiliate KOLD-TV under a shared services agreement established under Belo ownership, but Gannett would still handle advertising sales for the stations.|$|E

The station's newscasts were branded as NewsCenter 4 from 1977 until 2001, when it was changed to the current KRON 4 News.

40|$|This paper {{sheds light}} on {{newspaper}} sub-editors, the "forgotten stepchildren of the newsroom" and considers their position within the larger organizational model of <b>the</b> <b>newsroom.</b> <b>In</b> order to explore <b>the</b> sub-editor's position <b>in</b> <b>the</b> news production chain, we take an ethnographic approach. We draw on participant observation <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>newsrooms</b> of a Belgian broadsheet and a broadsheet from <b>the</b> Netherlands. <b>In</b> our study of the sub-editor, we observe how at both newspapers <b>the</b> <b>newsroom</b> model differs from those previously described by Esser, and we propose <b>the</b> term "Lowlands <b>newsroom</b> model". At <b>the</b> same time, we demonstrate how, although <b>the</b> same Lowlands <b>newsroom</b> model is applied <b>in</b> both <b>newsrooms,</b> <b>the</b> spatial setting, division of workload and the sub-editor's profile impact on the sub-editor's ability to intervene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> news production process. We argue that exploring this newsroom model is necessary, not only considering <b>the</b> general <b>newsroom</b> flow, but also the much debated future of the newspaper "subber". Furthermore, we aim {{to open the door}} to future journalism studies research of the sub-editor and hope to move towards a more complete definition of the sub-editor as a-in the language of Gieber-genuine "newspaperman"...|$|R
