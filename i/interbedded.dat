5|$|<b>Interbedded</b> {{sedimentary}} rock makes up 93% {{of the surface}} rock in the Catawissa Creek watershed, while the remaining 7% is sandstone. South of Mainville, the Catawissa Creek river valley is made of red shale. There is also conglomerate, greenish-gray sandstone, olive-colored shale, and anthracite coal near Catawissa Creek.|$|E
5|$|Siletzia is {{the massive}} {{formation}} of early to middle Eocene epoch marine basalts and <b>interbedded</b> sediments in the forearc of the Cascadia subduction zone; this forms the basement rock under western Oregon and Washington {{and the southern}} tip of Vancouver Island.

Red shale of the Mauch Chunk Formation is found in {{a substantial part of}} the watershed. The main rock types in the watershed are <b>interbedded</b> sedimentary rock, which occupies 70 percent of the watershed, and sandstone, which occupies 30 percent.|$|E
40|$|<b>Interbed</b> {{multiple}} reflections contain valuable informa-tion about the subsurface reflectivity distribution that can complement information obtained from primary re-flections and free-surface multiples. In this report two methods are developed {{and used to}} migrate <b>interbed</b> mul-tiples. The first method applies Fermat’s principle to find the specular reflection point along the <b>interbed</b> mul-tiple generating interface; the second method sums all the diffractions bouncing off the multiple generating interface. The first method is more computationally efficient, while the second method utilizes the full Fresnel zone along the <b>interbed</b> multiple generating interface. Numerical tests with synthetic VSP data and field data show that <b>interbed</b> multiples can illuminate areas below salt and can image salt boundaries. One challenge is that <b>interbed</b> {{multiple reflections}} are usually weak, thus the <b>interbed</b> multiple generating interface needs to be strong, and the reflector to be imaged also must be strong in or-der to generate noticeable <b>interbed</b> multiple reflections...|$|R
30|$|The {{occurrence}} of <b>interbeds</b> in thick oil formations {{in one of}} the main reasons that cause the difference of remaining oil distribution. A quantitative method for predicting <b>interbeds</b> was proposed and the sedimentary origin and division criterion were demonstrated. The distribution of <b>interbeds</b> in different types of sedimentary sand bodies were predicted and analyzed by combining the theory of sedimentology and reservoir bed architectural-element analysis. The <b>interbeds</b> in a single well were recognized from high resolution well logs, and inter-well <b>interbeds</b> were predicted by using the methods of cyclothem correlation, physical properties truncation, and conditional simulation. Finally a 3 -D model of <b>interbed</b> was built. Application to the Gudao Oilfield was successful.|$|R
40|$|AbstractCusp {{displacement}} {{catastrophe theory}} can {{be introduced to}} propose a new method about instability failure of the <b>interbed</b> for gas storage cavern in bedded salt in solution mining. We can calculate initial fracture drawing pace of this <b>interbed</b> to obtain 2 D and 3 D gas storage shapes at this time. Moreover, Stability evaluation of strength reduction finite element method (FEM) based on this catastrophe theory can used to evaluate this <b>interbed</b> stability after initial fracture. A specific example is simulated to obtain {{the influence of the}} <b>interbed</b> depth, cavern internal pressure, and cavern building time on stability safety factor (SSF). The results indicate: the value of SSF will be lower with the increase of cavern building time in solution mining and the increase of <b>interbed</b> depth and also this value remains a rise with the increase of cavern internal pressure Especially, we can conclude that the second-fracture of the <b>interbed</b> may take place when this pressure is lower than 6  MPa or after 6 days later of the <b>interbed</b> after initial fracture. According to above analysis, some effective measures, namely elevating the tube {{up to the top of}} the <b>interbed,</b> or changing the circulation of in-and-out lines, can be introduced to avoid the negative effects when the second-fracture of the <b>interbed</b> may occur...|$|R
5|$|Next is the Menefee Formation, {{the middle}} {{formation}} whose content features <b>interbedded</b> carbonaceous shales, siltstones, and sandstones. These were deposited in semi-marine environments of brackish water, such as swamps and lagoons. Due to its depositional {{environment and the}} organic material in its composition, there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation. At the top, this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone.|$|E
5|$|The Nama {{assemblage}} is best {{represented in}} Namibia. Three-dimensional preservation is most common, with organisms preserved in sandy beds containing internal bedding. Dima Grazhdankin believes that these fossils represent burrowing organisms, while Guy Narbonne maintains they were surface dwellers. These beds are sandwiched between units comprising <b>interbedded</b> sandstones, siltstones and shales – with microbial mats, where present, usually containing the fossils. The environment is interpreted as sand bars formed {{at the mouth}} of a delta's distributaries.|$|E
5|$|The oldest beds of this {{formation}} {{belong to}} the Dinosaur Canyon Member, a reddish, slope-forming rock layer with thin beds of siltstone that are <b>interbedded</b> with mudstone and fine sandstone. The Dinosaur Canyon, with a local thickness of , was probably laid down in slow-moving streams, ponds and large lakes. Evidence for this is in cross-bedding of the sediments and large numbers of fish fossils.|$|E
30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} influencing factors {{on the distribution of}} incremental oil displaced by a polymer flood (extra-displaced oil) using numerical reservoir simulation. These factors include the location, area and permeability of a thin low-permeability <b>interbed,</b> and the perforation location relative to the <b>interbed.</b> Simulation results show the locations from where the incremental oil was displaced by the polymer solution. The <b>interbed</b> position from the oil formation top affects the location of extra-displaced oil. The <b>interbed</b> area has a slight influence on the whole shape of extra-displaced oil. Larger <b>interbed</b> area leads to higher partition extent of extra-displaced oil. Higher vertical permeability of <b>interbeds</b> contributes to worse partition extent of extra-displaced oil and the partition effect disappears if the ratio of vertical to horizontal permeability is more than 0.05. The perforation location relative to the <b>interbed</b> affects polymer displacement efficiency, and also has a significant effect on the distribution of extra-displaced oil in polymer flooding.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} how {{the characteristics of}} <b>interbeds</b> affect hydraulic fracture propagation in the continental shale formation, a series of 300 mm × 300 mm × 300 mm concrete blocks with varying <b>interbeds,</b> based on outcrop observation and core measurement of Chang 7 - 2 shale formation, were prepared to conduct the hydraulic fracturing experiments. The results reveal that the breakdown pressure increases {{with the rise of}} thickness and strength of <b>interbeds</b> under the same in-situ field stress and injection rate. In addition, for the model blocks with thick and high strength <b>interbeds,</b> the hydraulic fracture has difficulty crossing the <b>interbeds</b> and is prone to divert along the bedding faces, and the fracturing effectiveness is not good. However, for the model blocks with thin and low strength <b>interbeds,</b> more long branches are generated along the main fracture, which is beneficial to the formation of the fracture network. What is more, combining the macroscopic descriptions with microscopic observations, the blocks with thinner and lower strength <b>interbeds</b> tend to generate more micro-fractures, and the width of the fractures is relatively larger on the main fracture planes. Based on the experiments, it is indicated that the propagation of hydraulic fractures is strongly influenced by the characteristics of <b>interbeds,</b> and the results are instructive to the understanding and evaluation of the fracability in the continental shale formation...|$|R
40|$|Most salt rock has <b>interbed</b> of {{mudstone}} in China. Owing to {{the enormous}} difference of mechanical properties between the mudstone <b>interbed</b> and salt rock, the stress-strain and creep behaviors of salt rock are significantly influenced by neighboring mudstone <b>interbed.</b> In order to identify the rules of wellbore shrinkage and casings equivalent stress in bedded salt rock stratum, three-dimensional finite difference models were established. The effects of thickness and elasticity modulus of mudstone <b>interbed</b> on the open wellbore shrinkage and equivalent stress of casing after cementing operation were studied, respectively. The {{results indicate that the}} shrinkage of open wellbore and equivalent stress of casings decreases with the increase of mudstone <b>interbed</b> thickness. The increasing of elasticity modulus will reduce the shrinkage of open wellbore and casing equivalent stress. Research results can provide the scientific basis for the design of mud density and casing strength...|$|R
5|$|The various {{formations}} of Siletzia {{are characterized}} as marine tholeiitic pillow basalts and volcanic breccia, often <b>interbedded</b> with sedimentary layers of continental origin, lying on oceanic crust. These are usually capped by {{a layer of}} alkalic volcanics deposited subaerially. All this suggests these formations were initially deposited in an oceanic environment, possibly as seamounts or an island arc.|$|E
5|$|In the Abrahams Creek watershed, 94 {{percent of}} the rock is <b>interbedded</b> {{sedimentary}} rock. The remaining 6 percent is sandstone. The main rock formations in the watershed of Abrahams Creek include the Catskill Formation, the Llwellyn Formation, the Pottsville Group, the Mauch Chunk Formation, and the Pocono Formation. These formations mainly consist of coal, limestone, sandstone, shale, and siltstone. The Catskill Formation mainly occurs in the watershed's upper reaches. The Mauch Chunk Formation, the Pocono Formation, and the Pottsville Group occur under the Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge. The Llwellyn Formation also occurs there, in addition to underlying the floodplain in the watershed. A considerable area in the watershed has been strip mined.|$|E
5|$|The depositional {{environment}} was a nearshore {{one where the}} seashore alternated between advance (transgression) and retreat (regression). At Zion, the limestones and fossils of the Timpoweap, Virgin Limestone, and Shnabkaib members of the Moenkopi Formation document transgressive episodes. Unlike the Timpoweap and Virgin Limestone members, the Shnabkaib contains abundant gypsum and <b>interbedded</b> mudstone resulting from deposition in a restricted marine environment with complex watertable fluctuations. Regressive, red bed layers separate the transgressive strata. Ripple marks, mud cracks, and thinly laminated bedding suggest that these intervening red shale and siltstone units were deposited in tidal flat and coastalplain environments.|$|E

40|$|Vadose zone lithology, {{hydrological}} {{characterization of}} <b>interbed</b> sediments, and hydrological data from subsurface monitoring of Idaho Nuclear Technology and Engineering Center wastewater infiltration are presented. Three-dimensional subsurface lithology of the vadose zone beneath the Vadose Zone Research Park {{is represented in}} a 2 dimensional (2 D) diagram showing interpolated lithology between monitoring wells. Laboratory-measured values for saturated hydraulic conductivity and porosity are given for three major <b>interbeds,</b> denoted as the B BC <b>interbed</b> (20 to 35 m bls), the C D <b>interbed</b> (40 to 45 m bls), and the DE 1 2 <b>interbed</b> (55 to 65 m bls), along with an overall physical description of the sediments and geologic depositional environments. Pre-operational pore water pressure conditions are presented to show the presence and location of perched water zones before pond discharge at the New Percolation Ponds. Subsurface infiltration conditions during initial high-volume discharge are presented to show water arrival times and arrival sequences. Steady-state conditions are then presented to show formation and locations of perched water zones and recharge sources after several months of discharge to the New Percolation Ponds...|$|R
40|$|A {{long-term}} {{assessment of}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) repository performance must consider the impact of gas generation resulting from the corrosion and microbial degradation of the emplaced waste. A multiphase fluid flow code, TOUGH 2 /EOS 8, was adapted to model the processes of gas generation, disposal room creep closure, and multiphase (brine and gas) fluid flow, {{as well as the}} coupling between the three processes. System response to gas generation was simulated with a single, isolated disposal room surrounded by homogeneous halite containing two anhydrite <b>interbeds,</b> one above and one below the room. The <b>interbeds</b> were assumed to have flow connections to the room through high-permeability, excavation-induced fractures. System behavior was evaluated by tracking four performance measures: (1) peak room pressure; (2) maximum brine volume in the room; (3) total mass of gas expelled from the room; and (4) the maximum gas migration distance in an <b>interbed.</b> Baseline simulations used current best estimates of system parameters, selected through an evaluation of available data, to predict system response to gas generation under best-estimate conditions. Sensitivity simulations quantified the effects of parameter uncertainty by evaluating the change in the performance measures in response to parameter variations. In the sensitivity simulations, a single parameter value was varied to its minimum and maximum values, representative of the extreme expected values, with all other parameters held at best-estimate values. Sensitivity simulations identified the following parameters as important to gas expulsion and migration away from a disposal room: <b>interbed</b> porosity; <b>interbed</b> permeability; gas-generation potential; halite permeability; and <b>interbed</b> threshold pressure. Simulations also showed that the inclusion of <b>interbed</b> fracturing and a disturbed rock zone {{had a significant impact on}} system performance...|$|R
5|$|The {{island of}} Lismore lies in Loch Linnhe, north east of Mull, in the Argyll and Bute council area. It is 15 km long and about 2 km wide, and {{oriented}} from SW to NE, roughly {{parallel to the}} Great Glen Fault. To the east is an arm of Loch Linnhe known as the Lynn of Lorn. Composed almost entirely of Dalradian limestone with <b>interbedded</b> black slate, Lismore has fertile soil and an abundance of trees and shrubs including ash and sycamore. The topography consists of sheltered furrows of land between raised areas that run longitudinally up the island's spine.|$|E
5|$|The limey oozes and mud {{were later}} lithified into the {{limestone}} and <b>interbedded</b> siltstone of the up-to-300foot (90m)-thick White Member of the Claron. This member erodes into white-colored monoliths {{that are found}} only at the highest elevations of the Paunsaugunt Plateau. Fossils are rare in the White Member and consist mainly of freshwater snails and clams, indicating that the lakes supported little life. Most arches and natural bridges in the park, including the famous Natural Bridge, were carved from sandstone beds in the Claron.|$|E
5|$|Next in the {{geologic}} {{column is}} the -thick Toroweap Formation (see 6c in figure 1). It consists {{of red and}} yellow sandstone and shaly gray limestone <b>interbedded</b> with gypsum. The formation was deposited in a warm, shallow sea as the shoreline transgressed (invaded) and regressed (retreated) over the land. The {{average age of the}} rock is about 273million years. In modern times it is a ledge- and slope-former that contains fossils of brachiopods, corals, and mollusks along with other animals and various terrestrial plants. The Toroweap is divided into the following three members: Seligman is a slope-forming yellowish to reddish sandstone and siltstone. Brady Canyon is a cliff-forming gray limestone with some chert. Wood Ranch is a slope-forming pale red and gray siltstone and dolomitic sandstone. An unconformity marks the top of this formation.|$|E

5|$|The soils in {{the lower}} part of the Kettle Creek {{watershed}} are highly acidic, deep, and well-drained. A total of 22 percent of the surface rock in this area is <b>interbedded</b> sedimentary rock, while sandstone makes up 78 percent. The Lower Kittanning coal seam is found in the Kettle Creek watershed. Rock formations in the Kettle Creek watershed include the Huntley Mountain Formation, the Burgoon Sandstone, the Pottsville Group, and the Allegheny Group. The Huntley Mountain Formation is from the Devonian period and the Mississippian epoch. The Burgoon Sandstone is from the Mississippian epoch and the Allegheny and Pottsville Groups are from the Pennsylvanian epoch. The Allegheny Group is the only rock formation in the watershed to contain coal that is economically worth mining.|$|E
5|$|Iran {{lies within}} the complex zone of {{collision}} between the Arabian Plate and the Eurasian Plate; near Qeshm {{the rate of}} convergence is about 25 millimeters annually. Part of this convergence is accommodated by shortening within the Zagros fold and thrust belt, with the remainder occurring {{to the north of}} the Iranian Plateau. The most active part of the Zagros is the 'Simply Folded Belt', which is characterised by large folds formed above a layer of late Neoproterozoic to Early Cambrian Hormuz salt, which locally reaches the surface in the crests of some anticlines as salt diapirs. The sedimentary rocks above the salt layer comprise a basal Cambrian conglomerate and a thick sequence of limestones of Palaeozoic to Upper Cretaceous age, known together as the 'Competent Group' due to their relatively high competence, followed by a sequence of mechanically weaker marls and <b>interbedded</b> limestones of latest Cretaceous to Lower Miocene age topped by Neogene sandstones and conglomerates. There is evidence of intermediate level detachment at some of the weaker layers, leading to folds at different stratigraphic levels have different locations, orientations or wavelengths. Earthquake focal mechanisms and hypocentral depths show that shortening is accommodated by a mixture of high-angle and low-angle reverse faulting, within either the lowest part of the sedimentary cover or in the basement beneath the Hormuz salt.|$|E

40|$|Research from {{biological}} and geological sources has highlighted {{the role of}} volcanoes in the outgassing of P, and thermal fixation and subsequent atmospheric oxidation of NOx in volcanic environments. The impact of these nutrient fluxes on biological systems has been demonstrated on present-day Hawai'i, and here we consider {{the impact on the}} plant communities within a large igneous province (LIP). The Miocene Columbia River Basalt Province, the youngest LIP on Earth, contains many sedimentary <b>interbeds</b> between the flows of the major extrusive phase, and these <b>interbeds</b> preserve variable but often diverse palynofloras. By integration of palynofloral analysis with analysis of macronutrient levels in the <b>interbeds</b> it can be suggested {{that there may have been}} significantly elevated levels of P within the lava field proximal to the source vents, a distribution mirrored by Ca and Mg. Evidence for potential volcanogenic eutrophication is restricted to > 103 year duration <b>interbeds,</b> contemporary with eruptive activity elsewhere in the LIP. The geochemistry and palynology of other <b>interbeds</b> demonstrate nutrient deficiency, with a potential route to nutrient sufficiency available from long-term symbiotic N-fixation. Elsewhere within the Columbia River Basalt Province, this process is short-circuited by the imput of felsic ash from the nearby Cascades Range of volcanoes...|$|R
