40|$|AbstractThe gene {{encoding}} a chlorophyll d-binding light-harvesting protein, pcbA from Acaryochloris marina (now {{called as}} accessory Chlorophyll Binding Protein CBPII) {{marked with a}} His-tag was transformed into the genome of Synechocystis PCC 6803. Protein gel electrophoresis and western blotting confirmed that this foreign chlorophyll d-binding protein CBPII was expressed and integrated into the thylakoid membrane and bound with chlorophyll a, the only type of chlorophyll present in Synechocystis PCC 6803. Native electrophoresis suggested that CBPII interacts with photosystem II of Synechocystis PCC 6803. Surprisingly, spectral analyses showed that the phycobiliproteins were suppressed in the transformed Synechocystis pcbA+, with a lower ratio of phycobilins to chlorophyll a.

40|$|A crucial {{issue in}} magnetically conﬁned plasmas {{characterized}} by relevant internal current redistribution, {{such as high}} beta and low ﬁeld toroidal devices, is the determination of their internal magnetic structure. The article presents a method for the integration of magnetic and nonmagnetic measurements in a model which considers a plasma described by stationary ideal magnetohydrodynamic equilibrium equations, with toroidal and poloidal plasma currents represented by distributed discrete ﬁlaments and current sheets. The model also includes the massive conductors representing the vessel, the shell, and the machine windings. The discrete current sets are determined by using as input data the total currents ﬂowing in the plasma, in the windings and in the vessel, as deduced by <b>external</b> <b>integral</b> magnetic measurements. The obtained ﬁlamentary current sets are then adjusted by imposing further constraints. One of the constraints is given by the set of local magnetic ﬁeld measurements provided by external pickup coils. A further and more signiﬁcant constraint is imposed by far infrared polarimeter, which gives an integral condition for each implemented measurement chord. The method is validated by using experimental data from the reversed ﬁeld pinch Reversed Field eXperiment, and {{the results suggest that}} the current density distribution is rather different from that usually predicted by conventional data inversion algorithms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{address the}} problem of {{computing}} the de-formed configuration of a drillstring, constrained to deform inside a curved borehole. This problem is encountered in applications such as torque-and-drag and directional drilling. In contrast to the traditional Lagrangian approach, the deformed drillstring is described by means of the distance from the borehole axis, in terms of the curvilinear coordinate defined along the borehole. This model is further implemented within a segmentation algorithm-where the borehole and the drillstring are divided into segments limited by contacts, which interest-ingly transforms the problem into a sequence of analogous auxiliary problems. This Eulerian view of the drillstring flow into the borehole resolves in one stroke a series of issues that afflict the classical Lagrangian approach: (i) the contact detection is reduced to checking whether a threshold on the distance function is violated, (ii) isoperimetric conditions are transformed into regular boundary conditions, instead of being treated as <b>external</b> <b>integral</b> constraints, (iii) the method yields a well-conditioned set of equations that does not degenerate with decreasing flexural rigidity of the drillstring and/or decreasing clearance between the drillstring and the borehole. Theoret-ical developments related to this Eulerian formulation of the drillstring are presented, along with an example illustrating the advantages of this approach. I...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{structural}} stabilization role of carotenoids in {{the formation}} of photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes is investigated theoretically. The π–π stacking and CH-π interactions between β-carotenes and their surrounding chlorophylls (and/or aromatic residues) in Photosystem I (PS 1) from the cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus were studied by means of the supermolecular approach {{at the level of the}} second-order Møller-Plesset perturbation method. PS 1 features a core <b>integral</b> <b>antenna</b> system consisting of 22 β-carotenes intertwined with 90 chlorophyll molecules. The binding environments of all 22 β-carotenes were systematically analyzed. For 21 out of the 22 cases, one or more chlorophyll molecules exist within van der Waals’ contacts of the β-carotene molecule. The calculated strengths of π–π stacking interactions between the conjugated core of β-carotene and the aromatic tetrapyrrole rings of chlorophyll are substantial, ranging from − 3. 54 kcal/mol for the perpendicular-positioned BCR 4004 …CHL 1217 pair to − 16. 01 kcal/mol for the parallel-oriented BCR 4007 …CHL 1122 pair. A strong dependence of the π–π stacking interaction energies on the intermolecular configurations of the two interacting π-planes is observed. The parallel-oriented β-carotene and chlorophyll pair is energetically much more stable than the perpendicular-positioned pair. The larger the extent of π–π overlapping, the stronger the interaction strength. In many cases, the β-ring ends of β-carotene molecules are found to interact with the tetrapyrrole rings of chlorophyll via CH-π interactions. For the latter interactions, the calculated interaction strengths vary from − 7. 03 to − 11. 03 kcal/mol, depending on the intermolecular configuration. This work leads to the conclusion that π–π stacking and CH-π interactions between β-carotene and their surrounding chlorophylls and aromatic residues play an essential role in binding β-carotenes in PS 1 from S. elongatus. Consequently, the molecular basis of the structural stabilization function of carotenoids in formation of the photosynthetic pigment-protein complexes is established...|$|R
