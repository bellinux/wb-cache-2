40|$|Inflammation plays {{a central}} role in the {{pathophysiology}} of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Exposure to cigarette smoke induces the recruitment of inflammatory cells in the airways and stimulates innate and adaptive immune mechanisms. Airway inflammation is involved in increased bronchial wall thickness, increased bronchial smooth muscle tone, mucus hypersecretion and loss of parenchymal elastic structures. Oxidative stress <b>impairs</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>integrity,</b> accelerates lung ageing and reduces the efficacy of corticosteroids by decreasing levels of histone deacetylase- 2. Protease-antiprotease imbalance <b>impairs</b> <b>tissues</b> and is involved in inflammatory processes. Inflammation is also present in the pulmonary artery wall and at the systemic level in COPD patients, and may be involved in COPD-associated comorbidities. Proximal airways inflammation contributes to symptoms of chronic bronchitis while distal and parenchymal inflammation relates to airflow obstruction, emphysema and hyperinflation. Basal levels of airways and systemic inflammation are increased in frequent exacerbators. Inhaled corticosteroids are much less effective in COPD than in asthma, which relates to the intrinsically poor reversibility of COPD-related airflow obstruction and to molecular mechanisms of resistance relating to oxidative stress. Ongoing research aims at developing new drugs targeting more intimately COPD-specific mechanisms of inflammation, hypersecretion and tissue destruction and repair. Among new anti-inflammatory agents, phosphodiesterase- 4 inhibitors have been the first to emerge. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Resolution of {{inflammation}} is defective after {{spinal cord}} injury (SCI), which <b>impairs</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>integrity</b> and remodeling and leads to functional deficits. Effective pharmacological treatments for SCI are not currently available. Maresin 1 (MaR 1) is a highly conserved specialized proresolving mediator (SPM) hosting potent anti-inflammatory and proresolving properties with potent tissue regenerative actions. Here, we provide evidence that the inappropriate biosynthesis of SPM in the lesioned spinal cord hampers the resolution of inflammation and leads to deleterious consequences on neurological outcome in adult female mice. We report that, after spinal cord contusion injury in adult female mice, the biosynthesis of SPM is not induced in the lesion site up to 2 weeks after injury. Exogenous administration of MaR 1, a highly conserved SPM, propagated inflammatory resolution after SCI, as revealed by accelerated clearance of neutrophils {{and a reduction in}} macrophage accumulation at the lesion site. In the search of mechanisms underlying the proresolving actions of MaR 1 in SCI, we found that this SPM facilitated several hallmarks of resolution of inflammation, including reduction of proinflammatory cytokines (CXCL 1, CXCL 2, CCL 3, CCL 4, IL 6, and CSF 3), silencing of major inflammatory intracellular signaling cascades (STAT 1, STAT 3, STAT 5, p 38, and ERK 1 / 2), redirection of macrophage activation toward a prorepair phenotype, and increase of the phagocytic engulfment of neutrophils by macrophages. Interestingly, MaR 1 administration improved locomotor recovery significantly and mitigated secondary injury progression in a clinical relevant model of SCI. These findings suggest that proresolution, immunoresolvent therapies constitute a novel approach to improving neurological recovery after acute SCI. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Inflammation is a protective response to injury or infection. To result in tissue homeostasis, inflammation has to resolve over time. Incomplete or delayed resolution leads to detrimental effects, including propagated <b>tissue</b> damage and <b>impaired</b> wound healing, as occurs after {{spinal cord injury}} (SCI). We report that inflammation after SCI is dysregulated in part due to inappropriate synthesis of proresolving lipid mediators. We demonstrate that the administration of the resolution agonist referred to as maresin 1 (MaR 1) after SCI actively propagates resolution processes at the lesion site and improves neurological outcome. MaR 1 is identified as an interventional candidate to attenuate dysregulated lesional inflammation and to restore functional recovery after SCI...|$|R

40|$|SummaryStem cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} <b>tissue</b> <b>integrity</b> during growth, aging, and pathogenic assaults. Adult gastrointestinal tract encounters numerous stimulations, and <b>impaired</b> <b>tissue</b> regeneration may lead to inflammatory diseases and cancer. Intestinal stem cells in adult Drosophila have recently been identified and shown to replenish the various cell types within the midgut. However, {{it is not known}} whether these intestinal stem cells can respond to environmental challenges. By feeding dextran sulfate sodium and bleomycin to flies and by expressing apoptotic proteins, we show that Drosophila intestinal stem cells can increase the rate of division in response to tissue damage. Moreover, if tissue damage results in epithelial cell loss, the newly formed enteroblasts can differentiate into mature epithelial cells. By using this newly established system of intestinal stem cell proliferation and tissue regeneration, we find that the insulin receptor signaling pathway is required for intestinal stem {{cell division}}...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{identify}} nursing diagnoses {{and theoretical}} frameworks used in neonatal units through a literature review. METHOD: Cinahl, Medline and Lilacs, database {{were used to}} perform this study. The descriptors used were: "Nursing Diagnosis" AND "Models, Nursing" OR "Nursing Theory" AND "Infant" OR "Newborn". The search was limited to articles published from 2000 to November 2013. Studies were selected only if they were written in English, Spanish, Portuguese and Italian. RESULTS: In the literature review two taxonomies and six major theoretical frameworks were identified. The most frequently detected nursing diagnoses were: activity intolerance, impaired spontaneous ventilation, ineffective breathing pattern, risk for aspiration, delayed growth and development, Ineffective breastfeeding, Ineffective infant feeding pattern, hyperthermia / hypothermia, risk for infection, <b>impaired</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>integrity,</b> Interrupted family processes, risk for impaired parenting, risk for impaired attachment, interrupted family processes. Diagnoses applying to parents' psychosocial sphere were identified, enabling the newborn's integral evaluation, including the family.

40|$|Objective: to {{validate}} the operational definitions of the defining characteristics and risk factors of the three NANDA International (NANDA-I) nursing diagnoses and to revise these diagnoses' definitions. Method: content validation of nursing diagnosis. 146 defining characteristics and risk factors were identified in the literature in Brazilian and international databases. This was followed by content validation of the definitions of these diagnoses (presented by NANDA-I) and of the operational definitions (developed by the researchers) of the defining characteristics and risk factors, carried out by six expert nurses, regarding relevance, clarity and comprehensiveness. Result: of the 146 defining characteristics and risk factors, 22 were considered redundant and were excluded. The experts proposed changing the definitions of the diagnoses of <b>Impaired</b> <b>Tissue</b> <b>Integrity</b> and Risk for Impaired Skin Integrity. It was possible to identify various defining characteristics and risk factors which are not present in the NANDA-I taxonomy but which are indicated in the literature. Conclusion: the process attained its objective of producing valid operational definitions for defining characteristics and risk factors, which will permit the undertaking of validation studies for these diagnoses. The study's contribution to advancing scientific knowledge consists in its presenting clearer operational definitions for these diagnoses and a higher number of defining characteristics and risk factors, which will assist the nurses in the identification {{and use of the}} same with greater accuracy in clinical practice...|$|E
40|$|Diabetic skin {{is known}} to have {{deficient}} wound healing properties, but little is known of its intrinsic biomechanical properties. We hypothesize that diabetic skin possesses inferior biomechanical properties at baseline, rendering it more prone to injury. Skin from diabetic and nondiabetic mice and humans underwent biomechanical testing. Real-time PCR was performed for genes integral to collagen synthesis and degradation. MMP- 2 and MMP- 9, and TIMP- 1 protein levels were assessed by ELISA and zymography. Collagen I and III content was assessed using Western blot analysis. At baseline, both murine and human diabetic skin was biomechanically inferior compared to nondiabetic skin, with decreased maximum stress and decreased modulus (P < 0. 001 and < 0. 05, respectively). Surprisingly, the expression of genes involved in collagen synthesis were significantly up-regulated, and genes involved in collagen degradation were significantly down-regulated in murine diabetic skin (P < 0. 01). In addition, MMP- 2 and MMP- 9 /TIMP- 1 protein ratios were significantly lower in murine diabetic skin (P < 0. 05). Collagen I levels and I:III ratios were lower in diabetic skin (P < 0. 05). These findings suggest that the predisposition of diabetics to wounds {{may be the result of}} <b>impaired</b> <b>tissue</b> <b>integrity</b> at baseline, and are due, in part, to a defect in the regulation of collagen protein synthesis at the post-transcriptional level...|$|E

40|$|In {{a recent}} review we {{addressed}} {{the role of the}} transcription factor NF-κB, in shaping the cancer microenvironment. NF-κB, which interacts with chromatin modulators by cell-specific dynamics, controls cell interactions during inflammation, and its abnormal feedback regulation is implicated in cancer. Inflammation normally reprograms cells through changes in key topological elements of chromosomal DNA. As a result, inflammation overrides cell phenotype: initially, reprogramming cell function halts processes that impede the response of a damaged tissue to the cause of the harm, and eventually, late reprogramming of cells will replenish tissue structure and restore function.
