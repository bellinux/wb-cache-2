40|$|A mask {{programmable}} {{technology to}} implement RF and microwave integrated circuits using {{an array of}} standard 90 -nm CMOS transistors is presented. Using this technology, three wideband amplifiers with more than 15 -dB <b>forward</b> <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> operating in different frequency bands inside a 4 - 22 -GHz range are implemented. The amplifiers achieve high gain-bandwidth products (79 - 96 GHz) despite their standard multistage designs. These amplifiers are based on an identical transistor array interconnected with application specific coplanar waveguide (CPW) transmission lines and on-chip capacitors and resistors. CPW lines are implemented using a one-metal-layer post-processing technology over a thick Parylene-N (15 mum) dielectric layer that enables very low loss lines (~ 0. 6 dB/mm at 20 GHz) and high-performance CMOS amplifiers. The proposed integration approach {{has the potential for}} implementing cost-efficient and high-performance RF and microwave circuits with a short turnaround time...|$|E
40|$|Surface {{acoustic}} wave (SAW) devices {{are well known}} for mass-sensitive sensor applications. In biosensing applications, chemical and biochemically evoked binding processes on surfaces are detected in liquid environments using delay line or resonator sensor configurations, preferably {{in combination with the}} appropriate microfluidic devices. All configurations share the common feature of analyzing the transmission characteristic of the propagating SAW. In this paper, a novel SAW-based impedance sensor type is introduced which uses only one interdigital transducer (IDT), simultaneously as the SAW generator and the sensor element. Here, the input port reflection coefficient S 11 is measured at the IDT instead of the commonly used S 21 <b>transmission</b> <b>forward</b> <b>gain</b> parameter. Thus, a sharp and distinct peak of the S 11 spectrum is obtained, enabling a comfortable direct readout of the sensor signal. Proof of the concept was gained by analyzing the specific binding of the 4 -mercaptophenylacetic acid gold nanoparticles (MPA–AuNP) directly to the IDT surface. The corresponding binding kinetic of the MPA–AuNP on the functionalized gold surface has been analyzed and a sensitivity of 7. 4 mΩ nM− 1 has been determined...|$|R

30|$|For a Fredkin gate {{operated}} with {{continuous control}} inputs the signal output is almost zero {{for a considerable}} range of small control inputs. However, for very high control inputs, i.e., significantly above ξ _ 0, the signal output decreases instead of staying constant as would be desirable for a step-function like profile. We found that this issue can be addressed by transmitting the control input through a single mode Kerr-nonlinear cavity, with resonance frequency chosen such that the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> |c'/c| is peaked close to c'=ξ_ 0. For input amplitudes larger than c, the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> is lower (although |c'| still grows monotonically with |c|) which extends the input range over which the subsequent Fredkin gate stays in the on-state.|$|R

We show that the problem is convex with respect to the squared norm of the <b>transmission</b> <b>gains,</b> and that a closed-form solution can be found using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our results indicate that a constant PD can be maintained with decreasing sensor transmit gain provided that the number of antennas increases at the same rate. This is contrasted with the case of a single-antenna FC, where PD is monotonically decreasing with transmit gain. On the other hand, we show that when the transmit power is high, the single- and multi-antenna FC both asymptotically achieve the same PD upper bound.

Once our C band link budget was fully performed to model our link and ready to work in real time with several received values (GPS position, roll, pitch and yaw) from the aircraft and other values from the Ground System (azimuth and elevation of the reception telemetry antenna), it was necessary to avoid a constant value of the transmitter antenna and estimate its values with better accuracy depending of the relative beam angles between the transmitter antenna and receiver antenna.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Investigate the {{effectiveness}} and frequency dependence of central drive transmission via the alpha-motoneuron pool to the muscle. METHODS: We describe {{a model for}} the simulation of alpha-motoneuron firing and the EMG signal as response to central drive input. The transfer in the frequency domain is investigated. Coherence between stochastical central input and EMG is also evaluated. RESULTS: The transmission of central rhythmicities to the EMG signal relates to the spectral content of the latter. Coherence between central input to the alpha-motoneuron pool and the EMG signal is significant whereby the coupling strength hardly depends on the frequency in a range from 1 to 100 Hz. Common central input to pairs of alpha-motoneurons strongly increases the coherence levels. The often-used rectification of the EMG signal introduces a clear frequency dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Oscillatory phenomena are strongly transmitted via the alpha-motoneuron pool. The motoneuron firing frequencies do {{play a role in the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>gain,</b> but do not influence the coherence levels. Rectification of the EMG signal enhances the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain,</b> but lowers coherence and introduces a strong frequency dependency. We think that it should be avoided.

40|$|In this study, a new {{theoretical}} {{foundation for}} the Discrete-Time Feedback Error Learning (DTFEL) method is proposed. This method {{is analogous to the}} original Continuous-Time Feedback Error Learning (FEL) originally proposed as a control model of the cerebellum in the field of computational neuroscience. DTFEL is superior to FEL since it is applicable for digital controllers which are commonly used nowadays. Based on the strictly positive realness, the stability of DTFEL has been validated. However, from the viewpoint of adaptive control, this condition is restricted since some required assumptions cannot be satisfied in real systems, such as the direct input-output <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> is required to be large. Moreover, the stability of the system is guaranteed by selecting a sufficiently large positive constant feedback gain, which is a vague requirement from the viewpoint of control system design. This study proposes another scheme for the DTFEL method which does not require any positive real condition and overcomes the direct input-output <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> requirement. This can be achieved by utilizing the error signal more effectively.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a fully integrated transmitter with embedded on-chip antennas to demonstrate on-wafer wireless testing. First, on-chip antenna characterization methods {{based on the}} measured <b>transmission</b> link <b>gain</b> are described. From the measured <b>transmission</b> link <b>gain,</b> the on-chip antenna gain is determined using the known transmitter gain, a path loss, and an off-chip antenna gain. The proposed two-step method utilizes a high-gain off-chip antenna transmission link for base line calibration data to obtain better gain accuracy. For wireless testing, a fully integrated a 1. 2 -GHz Hartley image-reject transmitter is implemented in an 40 -GHz ft InGaP/GaAs HBT process. The image rejection (IR) ratio is measured to demonstrate process control monitoring of device mismatches. Both dipole and loop antennas are integrated to study their radiation efficiency as their dimensions are much less than the wavelength. The loop antenna provides about 7 dB better <b>transmission</b> <b>gain.</b> The IR ratio is measured wirelessly from a number of samples to monitor the die-to-die variations in the in-phase/quadrature mismatch.
