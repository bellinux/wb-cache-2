30|$|<b>Prospective</b> <b>participants</b> were {{patients}} who were evaluated at our hospital for a history of ‘knee pain’, between November 2011 and May 2012, and who were diagnosed as having sustained a lesion in the avascular zone of the medial or lateral meniscus of the knee. The diagnosis was formed from the medical history, physical examination and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). <b>Prospective</b> <b>participants</b> were further assessed to exclude concomitant ligament deficiency, knee joint OA and injury to the articular cartilage. OA and articular cartilage injury were excluded on MRI preoperatively and by arthroscopy intraoperatively. Nineteen patients met our inclusion and exclusion criteria, provided informed consent, and {{were enrolled in the}} study. These patients subsequently underwent arthroscopic partial meniscectomy. The methods and procedures were approved by our institutional review board.|$|R

Since, for any given size of the buyer group, customers are better off outside than inside the group, opting out is a dominant strategy. Therefore, any buyer group that may emerge would be unstable, because all <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> would prefer to freeride.|$|R

40|$|In this essay, I {{argue that}} the privileging of romantic and {{familial}} ties by {{those who believe in}} the liberal state’s right to <b>exclude</b> <b>prospective</b> immigrants cannot be justified. The reasons that count in favour of these relationships count equally in favour of a great array of relationships, from friends to creative collaborators, and whatever else falls in between. The liberal partialist now faces a dilemma, either the scope of the right to exclude is much more limited or much broader than she previously assumed...|$|R

40|$|This study {{assessed}} self-expressed {{music education}} interests {{and described the}} music experi-ences of <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> in adult music education. Questionnaires were mailed {{to a sample of}} 800 music-performance attenders. Of the 275 people who returned question-naires, 183 indicated positive responses toward participation and 92 indicated negative responses. Among adults who expressed interest in music participation, piano was the instrument most frequently chosen for private study, followed by voice and guitar. Choral organizations ranked highest among preferred performance organizations, and aural analy-sis and introductory music history courses ranked highest among preferred areas of academ-ic study. Most of the previous formal experiences of <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> comprised pinvate lessons and participation in performance organizations; a surprising amount of self-direct-ed music experience and learning was reported. Results indicated several significant rela-tionships between course preferences and prior experiences with similar music activities. Positive attitude toward participation was found to be significantly related both to current involvement and to early participation in classroom general music. Parents and home were the most frequently cited positive influences in developing music interests...|$|R

Conventional research ethics emphasise the importance of weighing the risks and benefits for <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> as one of the key determinants of deeming a clinical trial ethical.

30|$|Ethics {{approval}} {{was obtained}} from the University Human Research Ethics Committee. Participants were recruited by convenience sampling methods and were gaming patrons at a gaming venue. Participants were recruited by direct contact on the evening in which the interview was conducted. <b>Prospective</b> <b>participants</b> included only those who were gambling when approached or who had been observed by the interviewer to be gambling at some stage during the evening. Interviews were conducted by the first author. All <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> who had been approached agreed to be interviewed. Semi-structured individual interviews were conducted in a room adjacent to the public bar in a hotel in a northwestern suburb of Melbourne. The interviews covered the topics in the same order, but participants decided how much they elaborated on each topic (See “Appendix” for interview questions). Themes reported in the research literature as correlates of gambling were discussed: the use of free time, familiarity with gambling, gambling of friends and family circles, stories about gambling, views on luck, fate, destiny, and religion. As recommended by Lumme-Sandt et al. (2000), the participants were encouraged to use their own words.|$|R

Scarne also went on to attempt to discredit Wilson's famous blackjack point count system. Scarne offered a challenge to blackjack card counters, but Scarne and the <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> were never able to agree upon the terms for the challenge.|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on two {{questions}} regarding the movement of persons across international borders: (1) do states {{have a right to}} unilaterally control their borders; and (2) if they do, are migration arrangements simply immune to moral considerations? Unlike open borders theorists, I answer the first question in the affirmative. However, I answer the second question in the negative. More specifically, I argue that states have a negative duty to <b>exclude</b> <b>prospective</b> immigrants whose departure could be expected to contribute to severe deprivation in their countries of origin. Countries have a right to unilaterally control their borders, but their exercise of this right is constrained by the demands of morality...|$|R
40|$|The {{motivation}} {{of participants in}} mandatory national youth service programs is a potentially important but often neglected factor in understanding why service programs do or do not reach the intended outcomes. The current study addresses this lacuna by testing competing theoretical frameworks on motivations for volunteering, namely functional, institutional and group identity theories and applying them to a mandatory national service program in a non-Western context: Ghana’s National Service Scheme (NSS). We analyse data from the National Service Scheme Survey, a web survey among almost 3000 university students and <b>prospective</b> NSS <b>participants.</b> Results indicate that the functional perspective on volunteering {{can be applied to}} mandatory community service and in a developing context. In addition, they illustrate that the institutional and group identity perspectives are complementary with this functional perspective, and can bring a substantial contribution to the explanation of the {{motivation of}} <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> in mandatory service. nrpages: 26 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|What role {{do people}} have in the Internet of Things? Compared to the {{impressive}} body of research that is currently tackling the technical issues of the Internet of Things, social aspects of agency, engagement, participation, and ethics, are receiving less attention. The goal of this 'Designing the Social Internet of Things' workshop is to contribute by shedding light on these aspects. We invite <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> to take a humanistic standpoint, explore people's relations with 'things' first, and then build on such relations so as to support socially relevant goals of engagement, relatedness, participation, and creativity...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of electronic marketplaces ahs been prolific {{in the last}} five years and the pressure for companies to participate, before they have determined how to recognise the benefits and pitfalls, has been intense. This has left <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> facing a wide variety of choices in the selection of potential trading sites, in a marketplace that is both dynamic and immature. Although there are different drivers pushing companies towards participation, an appreciation of how electronic marketplaces are developing their trading models can support the selection process and enhance the trading experience of the participants...|$|R
40|$|Experiments, where <b>prospective</b> <b>participants</b> are {{randomly}} assigned into {{experimental and control}} groups, are often regarded as the ideal approach to evaluation of manpower policies. This examination shows that such experimental designs can yield misleading and incomplete information about program impacts in cases where program effects vary among individuals. When individual heterogeneity is present, such designs at best provide unbiased estimates of average program effects, not of marginal effects. The latter are often more important for policy than the former. This paper proposes alternative experimental designs that permit estimation of the marginal as well as average program impacts. ...|$|R
50|$|Most {{competitions}} and contests held {{world over}} usually have an initial screening round {{in which they}} accept nominations or entries from <b>prospective</b> <b>participants.</b> After all the nominations and entries have been received, {{the organizers of the}} competition or contest evaluate and shortlist the required number of entries on the basis of certain parameters set by them, notify the participants whose entries have been shortlisted and invite them to participate in further rounds of the competition or contest. Those whose entries were not shortlisted may also be given feedback by the organizers with a reason for the rejection and tips for improvement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Prospective</b> <b>participants</b> {{were invited}} to visit an {{assessment}} centre,at which they completed an automated questionnaire and were interviewed about lifestyle, medical history and nutritional habits; basic variables such weight, height, blood pressure etc. were measured; and blood and urine samples were taken.

During the whole duration of the study it is intended that all disease events, drug prescriptions and deaths of the participants are recorded in a database, taking advantage of the centralized UK National Health Service.|$|R
40|$|How should states {{respond to}} the {{departure}} of talented individuals from the developing to the developed world [...] the so-called brain drain? In Debating Brain Drain, Gillian Brock and Michael Blake investigate whether restrictions on emigration can be justified {{in order to avoid}} the harmful effects of the brain drain. In this piece, I argue that the question of whether states have the right to limit the exit of their skilled citizens cannot be answered in isolation from the question of what global migration regime is best able to protect vulnerable persons. In particular, I argue that the responsibility to prevent the brain drain lies with recipient states, who are actually required to <b>exclude</b> <b>prospective</b> skilled immigrants when a number of conditions are met...|$|R
40|$|Haematological and {{rheological}} (plasma and serum viscosity, {{whole blood}} viscosity, and erythrocyte filterability) factors were studied in 31 age-sex matched pairs {{of patients with}} sickle cell haemoglobin C disease with and without proliferative sickle retinopathy (PSR). Patients with PSR had significantly higher mean cell haemoglobin and lower Hb F levels on average than the matched controls, but the viscosity and erythrocyte filtration indices did not differ between the 2 groups. There was, therefore, no evidence of rheological differences between patients with and without PSR {{at the time of}} the study, although transient rheological abnormalities at the time of development of PSR could not be <b>excluded.</b> <b>Prospective</b> longitudinal studies of rheology before, during, and after the development of PSR would be necessary to detect such changes...|$|R

During the interview, participants were asked to share what came to their mind as they reviewed the questions in the scale. At times, the interviewer also probed for clarifying questions and asked participants to consider how they would phrase items in their own words, how difficult the items were to answer, and suggestions about how we could modify the items to enhance relevance for the abortion counseling context [32].|$|R
