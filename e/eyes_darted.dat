2500|$|In four of Banville's novels (and one as Benjamin Black), he {{has used}} the trope of a character's <b>eyes</b> <b>darting</b> back and forth [...] "like a spectator at a tennis match".|$|R
6000|$|... "At {{least it}} cannot be your health," [...] said he, as his keen <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> over her, [...] "so ardent a bicyclist must {{be full of}} energy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I care not," [...] she exclaimed, {{wringing}} her hands; and {{the black}} pupils of her wide-open <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> wildly here and there like petrels before the storm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because I had {{suggested}} that he should come over. When he did not come I was surprised, and I naturally became alarmed for his safety when I heard cries upon the moor. By the way"--his <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> again from my face to Holmes's--"did you hear anything else besides a cry?" ...|$|E
60|$|Holmes had sat intently observant {{during this}} long discussion, missing no word that was said, with his keen <b>eyes</b> <b>darting</b> to right and to left, and his {{forehead}} wrinkled with speculation.|$|R
6000|$|With skill her <b>eyes</b> <b>dart</b> every glance, [...] Yet {{change so}} soon you’d ne’er suspect them; [...] For she’d persuade they wound by chance, [...] Though certain aim and art direct them.|$|R
6000|$|Mademoiselle, {{with that}} tigerish {{expansion}} of the mouth and her black <b>eyes</b> <b>darting</b> fire upon him, sits upright on the sofa in a rigid state, with her hands clenched--and her feet too, one might suppose--muttering, [...] "Oh, you Bucket, you are a devil!" ...|$|R
60|$|Presently a sharp knock {{was heard}} at the hall door. Mrs. March excused herself and went out. In the porch stood Theodosia Stapp {{and a woman}} whom Mrs. March did not at first glance recognize--a tall, aggressive-looking person, whose sharp black <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> in past Mrs. March and searched {{every corner of the}} hall before anyone had time to speak.|$|E
60|$|Those poor {{girls were}} in an agony. Everybody in the church was looking at our pew and smiling. We all felt that we were terribly disgraced; but we could do nothing. Peg was enjoying herself hugely, beyond all doubt. From where she sat {{she could see the}} whole church, {{including}} pulpit and gallery, and her black <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> over it with restless glances.|$|E
6000|$|... "It is I, my child," [...] {{said the}} old man. The face {{instantly}} disappeared, and soon after a wicket-door in the large portal opened. Antonio, who had ventured near to the building, caught a transient sight of a delicate female form. A pair of fine black <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> a look of surprise at seeing a stranger hovering near, and the door was precipitately closed.|$|E
60|$|At {{this moment}} Vivian {{was seized by}} the throat with a strong grasp. He turned round; it was Mr. Beckendorff, with a face deadly white, his full <b>eyes</b> <b>darting</b> from their sockets like a hungry snake's, and the famous Italian dagger in his right hand.|$|R
5000|$|In October 2007, he mocked Steve Staunton's {{physical}} and mental appearance, referring to [...] "the ways his <b>eyes</b> <b>dart</b> shiftily {{all over the place}} and he adopts that rictus grin" [...] before insulting those with a disability by concluding with the taunt, [...] "The Irish Special Olympics football team are looking for a player/ manager - if they'll have you".|$|R
5000|$|Giovanni Boccaccio {{provides}} one of {{the most}} memorable examples in his Il Filostrato, where he mixes the tradition of love at first sight, the <b>eye's</b> <b>darts,</b> and the metaphor of Cupid's arrow: [...] "Nor did he (Troilus) who was so wise shortly before... perceive that Love with his darts dwelt within the rays of those lovely eyes... nor notice the arrow that sped to his heart." ...|$|R
60|$|His <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> {{away the}} instant they met hers, but Betty had seen {{enough to show}} {{her that she had}} mistaken {{nervousness}} for truculence. Immediately, she was at her ease, and womanlike, had begun to control the situation. She made conversation pleasantly, praising the cats, admiring the birds, touching lightly on the general subject of domestic pets, until her woman's sixth sense told her that her host's panic had passed, and that she might now proceed to discuss business.|$|E
60|$|Miss Naylor's <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> bewildered {{glances at}} the roof where the {{crossing}} of the beams made such deep shadows; at the litter of brushes, tools, knives, and colours on a table made out of packing-cases; at the big window, innocent of glass, and flush with the floor, whence dangled a bit of rusty chain--relic {{of the time when}} the place had been a store-loft; her eyes were hastily averted from an unfinished figure of the nude.|$|E
60|$|Zenobia's <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> lightning, {{her cheeks}} flushed, the {{vividness}} of her expression {{was like the}} effect of a powerful light flaming up suddenly within her. My experiment had fully succeeded. She had shown me the true flesh and blood of her heart, by thus involuntarily resenting my slight, pitying, half-kind, half-scornful mention of the man who was all in all with her. She herself probably felt this; for it was hardly a moment before she tranquillized her uneven breath, and seemed as proud and self-possessed as ever.|$|E
60|$|Dola. For shame, my lord, {{if not for}} love, {{receive them}} With kinder eyes. If you confess a man, Meet them, embrace them, bid them welcome to you. Your arms should open, even without your knowledge, To clasp them in; your feet should turn to wings, To bear you to them; and your <b>eyes</b> <b>dart</b> out, And aim a kiss, ere you could reach the lips.|$|R
60|$|Gride hesitated. Ralph being, by this time, as furious as a baffled tiger, {{made for}} the door, and, {{attempting}} to pass Kate, clasped her arm roughly with his hand. Nicholas, with his <b>eyes</b> <b>darting</b> fire, seized him by the collar. At that moment, a heavy body fell with great violence on the floor above, and, in an instant afterwards, was heard a most appalling and terrific scream.|$|R

6000|$|... "Pull, pull, my good boys," [...] said Starbuck, in {{the lowest}} {{possible}} but intensest concentrated whisper to his men; while the sharp fixed glance from his <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> straight ahead of the bow, almost seemed as two visible needles in two unerring binnacle compasses. He did not say much to his crew, though, nor did his crew say anything to him. Only {{the silence of the}} boat was at intervals startlingly pierced by one of his peculiar whispers, now harsh with command, now soft with entreaty.|$|E
6000|$|Father Gatto's yellow <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> fire. 'You {{have not}} {{deserved}} it,' he uttered, {{in a voice}} like thunder, and seizing her he flung her into the jar of oil, where she was nearly suffocated. When {{she came to the}} surface screaming and struggling, the vengeful cat seized her again and rolled her in the ash-heap on the floor; then when she rose, dirty, blinded, and disgusting to behold, he thrust her from the door, saying: 'Begone, and when you meet a braying ass be careful to turn your head towards it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why {{should we}} not hate?" [...] she said. [...] "Who killed Chica's father, and blew her home to-rags? Who threw her out into this horrible England--pardon, mademoiselle, but it is horrible. Ah! les Boches! If my hatred could destroy them {{there would not be}} one left. Even my husband was not so mad about his {{painting}} when we lived at home. But here--!" [...] Her <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> at his face again, and then sank as if rebuked. Noel saw the painter's lips move. The sick woman's whole figure writhed.|$|E
6000|$|They look'd {{up to the}} sky, whose {{floating}} glow [...] Spread like a rosy ocean, {{vast and}} bright; [...] They gazed upon the glittering sea below, [...] Whence the broad moon rose circling into sight; [...] They heard the wave's splash, and the wind so low, [...] And saw each other's dark <b>eyes</b> <b>darting</b> light [...] Into each other--and, beholding this, [...] Their lips drew near, and clung into a kiss; ...|$|R

5000|$|The band's debut LP The Crucifucks—recorded in 1984 and {{released}} in 1985 on Jello Biafra's Alternative Tentacles label. Wisconsin followed in 1987, also on Alternative Tentacles. Between that album and 1996's L.D. <b>Eye,</b> <b>Dart</b> recorded two solo projects, Patricia, on Alternative Tentacles in 1990, and Black Tuesday, a self-released cassette, in 1991. After a long hiatus, Doc released an album entitled [...] "The Messiah" [...] on Crustacean Records in 2004. The moniker he {{used for this}} album is [...] "26".|$|R
60|$|But {{to return}} to my {{experience}} in Oppenheimer's cell. His body {{was that of a}} man long dead and shrivelled by desert heat. The skin that covered it was of the colour of dry mud. His sharp, yellow-gray eyes seemed the only part of him that was alive. They were never at rest. He lay on his back, and the <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> hither and thither, following the flight of the several flies that disported in the gloomy air above him. I noted, too, a scar, just above his right elbow, and another scar on his right ankle.|$|E
60|$|At {{sight of}} Felix, however, a sudden burst of frenzy seemed to possess at once all Tu-Kila-Kila's limbs. He brandished his spear violently, and set himself spasmodically in a posture of defence. His brow grew black, and his <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> out eternal hate and suspicion. It was evident he {{expected}} an instant attack, and was prepared {{with all his}} might and main to resist aggression. Yet he never offered to desert his post by the tree or to assume the offensive. Clearly, he was guarding the sacred grove itself with jealous care, and was as eager for its safety as for his own life and honor.|$|E
60|$|The {{red light}} was gone, the shudder was gone, and his gaze, which {{had come back}} to the boat for a moment, {{travelled}} away again. Wheresoever the strong tide met with an impediment, his gaze paused for an instant. At every mooring-chain and rope, at every stationery boat or barge that split the current into a broad-arrowhead, at the offsets from the piers of Southwark Bridge, at the paddles of the river steamboats as they beat the filthy water, at the floating logs of timber lashed together lying off certain wharves, his shining <b>eyes</b> <b>darted</b> a hungry look. After a darkening hour or so, suddenly the rudder-lines tightened in his hold, and he steered hard towards the Surrey shore.|$|E
500|$|Clear changed {{drastically}} in the sequel. Larter {{indicated that}} the character has gotten to a hardened place and has tucked herself inside because of the pain she experienced in her life. By having herself committed to a mental hospital, she has created a safehouse to avoid Death. In the draft screenplay of J. Mackye Gruber and Eric Bress, she is identified as while still beautiful, the young woman bears few traces of her former self. Her dark and haunted <b>eyes</b> <b>dart</b> around suspiciously, maddened by chronic ...|$|R
60|$|The lad {{continued}} his work without regarding us. I saw Holmes's <b>eye</b> <b>darting</b> to {{right and left}} among the litter of iron and wood which was scattered about the floor. Suddenly, however, we heard a step behind us, {{and there was the}} landlord, his heavy eyebrows drawn over his savage eyes, his swarthy features convulsed with passion. He held a short, metal-headed stick in his hand, and he advanced in so menacing a fashion that I was right glad to feel the revolver in my pocket.|$|R
6000|$|... "Were you {{too late}} also?" [...] asked the doctor, a solid prosperous-looking man, with {{conventional}} moustache and whiskers, but a lively <b>eye,</b> which <b>darted</b> over Kidd dubiously.|$|R
