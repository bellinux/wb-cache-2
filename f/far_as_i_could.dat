500|$|In {{many respects}} (to Kennan's consternation) the {{priorities}} of the administration emphasized creating alliances against the Soviets more than negotiating differences with them. In his memoirs, Kennan recalled, [...] "So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, we were expecting {{to be able to}} gain our objectives... without making any concessions though, only 'if we were really all-powerful, and could hope to get away with it.' I very much doubted that this was the case." ...|$|E

Although the film garnered a mixed reception among critics, {{it was a major}} box office success, earning over $80 million over its considerably smaller $9 million budget. In an interview with Entertainment Weekly, she noted that The Strangers was the most challenging role of her career.

500|$|In October 1955, Hans Stefan Santesson, an American writer, editor, and reviewer, began {{contributing}} [...] "Universe in Books", {{the regular}} book review column. A year later, with the September 1956 issue, Santesson took over from Margulies as editor. One immediate change {{was an increase}} in the number of articles about UFOs. Santesson ran several articles by Ivan T. Sanderson, among others, including articles on auras and on the abominable snowman. However, he also ran polemical articles opposed to the UFO mania, including strongly worded pieces by Lester del Rey and C.M. Kornbluth. Del Rey, at least, felt that Santesson was not a believer in UFOs: [...] "So <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> determine, Santessen [...] was skeptical about such things, but felt that all sides deserved a hearing and also that the controversies were good for circulation." ...|$|E

500|$|James Whale {{lived as}} an openly gay man {{throughout}} {{his career in the}} British theatre and in Hollywood, something that was virtually unheard of in the 1920s and 1930s. He and David Lewis lived together as a couple from around 1930 to 1952. While he did not go {{out of his way to}} publicize his homosexuality, he did not do anything to conceal it either. As filmmaker Curtis Harrington, a friend and confidant of Whale's, put it, [...] "Not in the sense of screaming it from the rooftops or coming out. But yes, he was openly homosexual. Any sophisticated person who knew him knew he was gay." [...] While there have been suggestions that Whale's career was terminated because of homophobia, and Whale was supposedly dubbed [...] "The Queen of Hollywood", Harrington states that [...] "nobody made a thing out of it as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> perceive".|$|E
500|$|There {{are several}} {{fundamental}} {{differences between the}} film and the original source material. For example, the comic {{is set in the}} 1990s, while the film is set sometime between 2028 and 2038: Alan Moore's original story was created as a response to British Thatcherism in the early 1980s and was set as a conflict between a fascist state and anarchism, while the film's story has been changed by the Wachowski [...] Brothers to fit a modern US political context. Alan Moore, however, charged that, in doing so, the story has turned into an American-centric conflict between liberalism and neo-conservatism, and abandons the original anarchist–fascist themes. Moore states that [...] "here wasn't a mention of anarchy as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see. The fascism had been completely defanged. I mean, I think that any references to racial purity had been excised, whereas actually, fascists are quite big on racial purity." [...] Furthermore, in the original story, Moore attempted to maintain moral ambiguity, and not to portray the fascists as caricatures, but as realistic, rounded characters. The time limitations of a film meant that the story had to omit or streamline some of the characters, details, and plotlines from the original story. Chiefly, the original graphic novel has the fascists elected legally and kept in power through the general apathy of the public, whereas the film introduces the [...] "St. Mary's virus", a biological weapon engineered and released by the Norsefire Party as a means of clandestinely gaining control over their own country.|$|E

The Post said “Political newcomer Saqib Ali has shown good command of issues and would bring new vigor to this district's delegation.” [...] On September Sept. 20, 2006, it was announced Ali had won the Democratic primary in Maryland's 39th Legislative District, defeating incumbent Delegate Joan F. Stern {{for a position on}} the slate with Del's Nancy J. King and Charles E. Barkley for the November general election. Stern had lost the outright endorsement of King and Barkley as she was not seen as a team-player. King noted that [...] "Ali was a 'breath of fresh air' to voters", while political veteran Gene Counihan said [...] "As <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> see, he followed the book on how to win an election.

2500|$|Nick was not {{away from}} Walford for long. In 1991, he {{returned}} with a heroin addiction but Dot initially shunned him and ignored his pleas for help. It was only after discovering Charlie had died that Nick was her only family left and was determined to reform him. Discussing the storyline, Altman has said: [...] "I found the heroin addiction quite exhausting actually, because I grew a really thick beard and my hair was always really filthy. When I was shooting those scenes I met {{with a guy who}} was an addict, and he told me things that you go through, like you can’t relax when you’re trying to come off it. You can‘t sleep so you drink loads of alcohol to try and kill the pain. The clock barely seems to move. For me as an actor, they really let me go as <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> <b>could</b> on that. We had letters as well from people saying how it‘s put them off heroin for life, so I guess we did a good job." [...] As the plot unfolded, Dot tried to curtail Nick's addiction by locking him in his room and forcing him to go cold turkey with the help of Pete Beale. During this period, The Queen Victoria landlord Eddie Royle is murdered. The murder was the key storyline of the show during the autumn of 1991. The episode Eddie was murdered was written by Tony McHale, it finished with a cliffhanger featuring Clyde Tavernier in the gardens standing over Eddie's body and holding a knife, which Nick witnessed from his bedroom window. Nick tells the police what he saw, leading to Clyde going on the run with the help of Michelle Fowler. Joe Wallace eventually came forward, saying he saw Nick out on the square on the night of Eddie’s murder, having escaped his room and climbed down a drain pipe. Nick confesses to Dot that he was responsible but insists that it was an accident. Nick is subsequently arrested and charged with Eddie’s murder and he stands trial in January 1993. A week's worth of episodes were devoted to the trial, and were all written by Tony Jordan. To present the story of Nick's trial the programme-makers themselves had to review the evidence and watch the episodes leading up to the death of Eddie. In the end, although it was clear that Nick was responsible for stabbing Eddie, it was not clear that it was murder and the jury returned a verdict of not guilty. Altman summarised: [...] "Through having a really good defence and lying his head off once again, he got away with murder".|$|E

Craigavon denied the assertions at length, ending with: [...] "Since we took up office we have tried to be absolutely fair towards all the citizens of Northern Ireland. Actually, on an Orange platform, I, myself, laid down the principle, to which I still adhere, that I was Prime Minister not of one section of the community but of all, and that <b>as</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> <b>I</b> possibly <b>could</b> <b>I</b> was going to see that fair play was meted out to all classes and creeds without any favour whatever on my part." ...|$|R
