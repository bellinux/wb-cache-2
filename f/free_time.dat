5|$|Specific {{findings}} in sociological studies of leisure are illustrated by John Robinson's late-1970s study of American leisure. Robinson found that Americans, on average, have {{four hours of}} leisure time each weekday, and more on weekends—six hours on Saturdays, almost eight on Sundays. Amount of leisure time diminishes with age, work, marriage, and children. However, the amount of <b>free</b> <b>time</b> does not significantly depend on an individual's wealth. People desire less <b>free</b> <b>time</b> if they are uncertain of their economic future, or if their job is their central interest. During {{the second half of}} the twentieth century, watching television became a major leisure activity, causing a substantial decrease in the time dedicated to other activities; in the early 1970s the average American had 4 hours of leisure per day, and spent 1.5 of them watching television. Shared leisure activities increase marital satisfaction.|$|E

5|$|After earning enough money, Kertész quickly {{bought his}} first camera (an ICA box camera) in 1912, despite his family's protests to {{continue}} his career in business.

50|$|In 2002, in {{an effort}} to stanch the {{bleeding}} at its paper in Los Angeles, NTI entered into an agreement with Village Voice Media (VVM), a competing chain that published a number of alternative newspapers including the Village Voice, LA Weekly and the Cleveland <b>Free</b> <b>Times.</b> VVM would sell the <b>Free</b> <b>Times</b> to NTI, and NTI would sell New Times LA to VVM. This resulted in the weaker, money-losing paper in each of the two markets being closed by their new owners, a reflection of the two companies’ belief that the L.A. and Cleveland markets could simply no longer sustain two competing alt-weeklies. After critics cried foul, the U.S. Department of Justice launched an antitrust investigation. The investigation resulted in a settlement that required the companies to sell off the assets and titles of the <b>Free</b> <b>Times</b> and NTLA to new potential competitors.|$|R
