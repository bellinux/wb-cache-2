50|$|A <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> on an {{aircraft}} is a mechanism that <b>locks</b> <b>control</b> surfaces and keeps open aircraft doors in place while the aircraft is {{parked on the}} ground and non-operational. <b>Gust</b> <b>locks</b> prevent wind from causing unexpected movements of the control surfaces and their linked controls inside the aircraft, as well as aircraft doors on some aircraft. Otherwise wind gusts could cause possible damage to the control surfaces and systems, or nearby people, cargo, or machinery. Some <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> are external devices attached directly to the aircraft's control surfaces, while others are attached to the flight controls inside the cockpit.|$|R
5000|$|A <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> {{can pose}} a serious safety hazard if its removal is omitted before an aircraft's takeoff, because it renders the flight control inoperative. Many {{internal}} <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> have a safety feature that locks out the aircraft's throttle or engine-start controls until removed and stowed. External-only <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> typically lack this safety feature, {{and must be}} tagged with a large red [...] streamer.|$|R
50|$|The {{very first}} example built of the Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress, the initial Model 299 aircraft, {{was lost in}} just this way on October 30, 1935, when its {{self-contained}} <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> were left engaged, with the resulting crash killing Boeing chief test pilot Leslie Tower, and United States Army Air Corps test pilot Ployer Peter Hill. Less than a year later, German Luftwaffe Generalleutnant Walter Wever lost {{his life in a}} similar accident from <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> neglect, when his Heinkel He 70 Blitz monoplane crashed on June 3, 1936, from the Blitz's aileron <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> not being disengaged before takeoff. Prince Gustaf Adolf of Sweden, the American singer and actress Grace Moore and 21 others were killed in 1947 during the crash of a KLM flight at Copenhagen Airport due to the flight crew forgetting to disengage the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> on the tail fin of the aircraft. The crash of Air Indiana Flight 216 occurred due to failure to remove the <b>gust</b> <b>locks.</b>|$|R
25|$|The AAIB {{investigation}} {{concluded that}} the accident {{was caused by the}} locked condition of the aircraft's elevators which prevented the aircraft rotating into a flying attitude. It was thought likely that the elevator <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> became re-engaged during the pilots' pre-takeoff checks, and that it was not noticed until the takeoff was so far advanced that a successful abandonment within the overrun area could not be made. The re-engagement of the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> was made possible by the condition of the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> lever gate plate and gate-stop strip, to which non-standard repairs had been made.|$|R

50|$|On December 5, 1978, Douglas C-53 N25656 of Caribe Air Sales crashed {{shortly after}} {{take-off}} and {{was destroyed by}} fire. The <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> had not been removed before flight and the aircraft was overloaded. All three people on board were killed.|$|R
50|$|One {{recent example}} of a tragedy {{involving}} a <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> left in place was a crash of a Gulfstream IV at Hanscom Field on May 31, 2014. This crash killed Philadelphia Inquirer co-owner Lewis Katz as well as 6 others.|$|R
50|$|The {{probable}} {{cause of the}} crash {{was determined to be}} failure to remove the <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> that had secured the aircraft's elevators while it was parked. It was the worst aviation accident in Denmark {{at the time of the}} crash.|$|R

The aircraft was departing to Atlantic City, New Jersey when it failed to take off because the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> was left engaged.|$|R
50|$|On 28 June 1971, Douglas C-47 N90627 of Lake Riverside Estates {{crashed on}} {{take-off}} on a domestic non-scheduled passenger flight to San Jose International Airport. Seventeen of the 24 {{people on board}} were killed. The cause of the accident was that flight was attempted with the rudder and elevator <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> in place. Inadequate pre-flight inspection was a contributory factor.|$|R
50|$|January 9, 1998 - a Cessna 208B Super Cargomaster, on {{take off}} from Maiden-Little Mountain Airport in Maiden, North Carolina on a flight to Greensboro, North Carolina, veered off the runway and hit trees.

5000|$|The Civil Aeronautics Board {{concluded}} {{the report on}} the accident by citing pilot error of the source. The report read: [...] "The Board determines that the probable cause of this accident was either {{the failure of the}} pilot to release the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> before take-off, or his decision to discontinue the take-off because of apprehension resulting from rapid use of a short runway under a possible calm wind condition." ...|$|R
5000|$|On December 13, 1977, Douglas C-53 N51071 of National Jet Services, {{operating}} as Air Indiana Flight 216, crashed on take-off from Evansville on a non-scheduled passenger flight to Nashville Metropolitan Airport, Tennessee. All 29 {{people on board}} were killed, including the entire University of Evansville basketball team. The cause of the accident was that the <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> had not been removed and the aircraft was improperly loaded, resulting in an aft CoG.|$|R
50|$|Dan-Air Flight 0034, a Hawker Siddeley 748 series 1 (registration G-BEKF) {{operating}} an {{oil industry}} support flight crashed on 31 July 1979 at Sumburgh Airport in the Shetland Islands. The aircraft failed to become airborne, {{ran through the}} perimeter fence, and crashed into the sea. The accident {{was due to the}} elevator <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> having become re-engaged, preventing the aircraft from rotating into a flying attitude. The aircraft was destroyed and 17 of the 47 people on board drowned.|$|R
25|$|Mechanical or {{manually}} operated flight control systems {{are the most}} basic method of controlling an aircraft. They were used in early aircraft and are currently used in small aircraft where the aerodynamic forces are not excessive. Very early aircraft, such as the Wright Flyer I, Blériot XI and Fokker Eindecker used a system of wing warping where no conventionally hinged control surfaces were used on the wing, and sometimes not even for pitch control as on the Wright Flyer I and original versions of the 1909 Etrich Taube, which only had a hinged/pivoting rudder {{in addition to the}} warping-operated pitch and roll controls. A manual flight control system uses a collection of mechanical parts such as pushrods, tension cables, pulleys, counterweights, and sometimes chains to transmit the forces applied to the cockpit controls directly to the control surfaces. Turnbuckles are often used to adjust control cable tension. The Cessna Skyhawk is a typical example of an aircraft that uses this type of system. <b>Gust</b> <b>locks</b> are often used on parked aircraft with mechanical systems to protect the control surfaces and linkages from damage from wind. Some aircraft have <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> fitted as part of the control system.|$|R
50|$|Following a {{checklist}} {{would have shown}} that the <b>gust</b> <b>lock</b> was engaged on the Gulfstream IV crash on May 31, 2014. The National Transportation Safety Board downloaded data from the aircraft's recorder and found it was a habit: 98% of the previous 175 takeoffs were made with incomplete flight-control checks. The National Business Aviation Association analyzed 143,756 flights in 2013-2015 by 379 business aircraft and only partial flight-control checks were done before 15.6% of the takeoffs and no checks at all on 2.03% of the flights.|$|R
50|$|According to {{researcher}} and writer Atul Gawande, {{the concept of}} a pre-flight checklist was first introduced by management and engineers at Boeing Corporation following the 1935 crash of the prototype Boeing B-17 (then known as the Model 299) at Wright Field in Dayton, Ohio, killing both pilots. Investigation found that the pilots had forgotten to disengage the crucial <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> (devices which stop control surfaces moving in the wind while parked) prior to take-off. Life magazine published the resulting lengthy and detailed B-17 checklist in its 24 August 1942 issue.|$|R
50|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{blamed the}} crash on the pilot's failure to remove <b>gust</b> <b>locks</b> {{on the right}} aileron and the rudder before takeoff, {{as well as an}} {{overloaded}} baggage compartment. The NTSB report said that the plane {{might have been able to}} stay airborne had only one of the problems existed. As it was, the extra baggage shifted the plane's center of gravity to the back end, and the locked rudder and aileron made it impossible to provide the needed lift to overcome the extra weight.|$|R

5000|$|Development {{continued}} on the Boeing Model 299, and on 30 October 1935, Army Air Corps test-pilot Major Ployer Peter Hill and Boeing employee Les Tower took the Model 299 {{on a second}} evaluation flight. The crew forgot to disengage the [...] "gust locks", a system of devices integral to the design that held the bomber's movable control surfaces in place while the aircraft was parked on the ground. After takeoff, due to the failure to manually disengage all of the <b>gust</b> <b>locks,</b> the aircraft entered a steep climb, stalled, nosed over, and crashed, killing Hill and Tower (other observers survived with injuries).|$|R

40|$|This report, {{which is}} a {{continuation}} of the "Preliminary report on free flight testing" (report no. NACA-TR- 70), presents a detailed theoretical analysis of statical stability with free and <b>locked</b> <b>controls</b> and also the results of many free flight test on several types of airplanes. In developing the theory of stability with <b>locked</b> <b>controls</b> an expression for pitching moment is derived in simple terms by considering the total moment as the sum of the moments due to wings and tail surface. This expression, when differentiated with respect to angle of incidence, enables an analysis to be made of the factors contributing to the pitching moment. The effects of slipstream and down wash are also considered and it is concluded that the C. G. Location has but slight effect or stability, and that stability is much improved by increasing the efficiency of the tail surfaces, which may be done by using an "inverted" tail plane. The results of free flight tests with <b>locked</b> <b>controls</b> are discussed at length and it is shown that the agreement between the experimental results and theory is very satisfactory. The theory of stability with free controls is not amendable to the simple mathematical treatment used in the case of <b>locked</b> <b>controls,</b> but a clear statement of the conditions enables several conclusions to be drawn, one of which is that the fixed tail surfaces should be much larger than the movable surfaces...|$|R
