40|$|SummaryTemporal {{resolution}} {{is essential to}} speech acoustic perception. It may be altered in subjects with auditory disorders, thus impairing the development of spoken and written language. Aim: The goal was to compare temporal resolution of children with normal hearing, with those bearing conductive hearing loss and auditory processing disorders. Materials and methods: The sample had 31 children, between 7 and 10 years of age, broken down into three groups: G 1 : 12 subjects with normal hearing; G 2 : 7 with conductive hearing loss and G 3 : 12 subjects with auditory processing disorders. This study was clinical and experimental. Selection procedures were: a questionnaire to be answered by the parents/guardians, audiologic and hearing processing evaluation. The study procedure was the test to detect breaks in silence at 50 dB HL above the mean values of 500, 1000 and 2000 Hz in both ears in 500, 1000, 2000 and 4000 Hz. To analyze the data we used the Wilcoxon Test with a 1 % significance level. Results: We noticed a difference between G 1 and G 2 and between G 1 and G 3 in all the frequencies. On the other hand, this difference was not seen between G 2 and G 3. Conclusion: conductive hearing loss and auditory processing disorders can <b>impact</b> <b>break</b> detection thresholds...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{new method}} is {{demonstrated}} to detect impacts of hypervelocity particles {{in real-time and}} to determine the size of particles. It uses a resistive grid on a thin substrate (here Duroid). Penetration of the substrate in an <b>impact</b> <b>breaks</b> lines on the grid, changing the overall resistance of the grid. The change in resistance {{is proportional to the}} width of the damaged area (i. e. number of resistive lines that are broken), which is in turn proportional to the impactor size. This method provides a large area, low mass, low power detector for measuring the flux of small dust particles in space. Based on experimental data (taken in a two-stage light gas gun), we show that impacts at 5 km s- 1 demonstrate that the principle works as described for particles 150 μm and above and that in theory could work for impacts down to size scales as small as 50 μm...|$|R

But are the benefits of mobility evenly distributed? Although the importance of mobility to the surrounding community is an intuitive idea, it has been difficult to test empirically with data until recently. Drawing from innovative mobility data provided by Chetty et al. (2014 a) for Metropolitan Statistical Areas (MSAs), I study the social consequences of intergenerational income mobility occurring across the local class structure. I use ordinary least squares (OLS) regression to investigate the impact of local mobility structures on median earnings and poverty, as well as how this <b>impact</b> <b>breaks</b> down by race/ethnicity and gender, for MSAs in the United States. Overall, I find that mobility has a significant positive relationship with median earnings, and a significant negative relationship with poverty, but these relationships are stratified by race/ethnicity and gender. The effects are strongest for white males. They weaken in magnitude and significance for females, Hispanics, and blacks in comparison, and are nonsignificant for blacks entirely...|$|R
40|$|There are {{widespread}} {{assumptions about}} the potential <b>impacts</b> of short <b>breaks</b> on family carers and disabled children. This review aims to evaluate the existing international research evidence concerning the <b>impacts</b> of short <b>breaks</b> on families with a disabled child. Electronic literature searches were conducted using ASSIA, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and Web of Science, and requests for information were sent to selected email lists. Of 60 articles or reports identified {{for inclusion in the}} review, the vast majority of studies were cross-sectional, with only eight studies using quasi-experimental pre-post designs or longitudinal designs. Nonetheless, the consistency with which some findings have been reported suggests that short breaks appear to have the potential to positively impact on not only the well-being of carers, but also the children receiving short breaks and their families as a whole. Additional research is warranted in a number of areas. First, research needs to consider the <b>impact</b> of short <b>breaks</b> on fathers. Second, {{there is a need to}} consider in more depth how short <b>breaks</b> can <b>impact</b> on the siblings of disabled children.

Fourth, research needs to look at the longer term <b>impact</b> of short <b>breaks</b> on outcomes for disabled children and their families. What is needed is evidence on what type of short breaks are best for children and families with particular characteristics at particular times during the course of the child's maturation towards adulthood...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. A novel {{mesoporous}} composite {{water purification}} material was synthesized from natural zeolite to possess certain water purification properties {{as well as}} in proper particle size range for optimal fluid flow, particle retention and mass transfer in fixed bed applications. The meerschaum was used as the framework material in the experimental manufacturing procedure, polyethylene alcohol with carboxylic methylic cellulose was used as cohesive reagent, and H 2 O 2 as bubble-forming agent. And the resulted granular product has good abrasion resistance ability with the measured <b>impact</b> <b>breaking</b> time reaching 12 hours. In addition, its decoloring rate is only 4. 4 % lower and its CODcr removing is only 13. 2 % lower than those of the original powder product, respectively. As a whole, the granulation potential and significantly expands the zeolite wastewater treatment application range with (only is not necessary) minor reduction of its treatment efficiency. Experiment When a water purification material is used there is a clear assumption, the smaller particle size is, the larger proportion of surface area is, getting more contact between the cleaning material and the pollutant, and ensuring a better purification effect. And many articles have been published on the topic of water purification material [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. However, in practical applications, the smalle...|$|R
