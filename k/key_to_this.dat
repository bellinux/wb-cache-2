5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} {{his ability to}} run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as they had all season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
5|$|In August, {{plans were}} {{in place for the}} Allied forces {{to break out of the}} ANZAC foothold. <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> was seizing the Sari Bair Range. On 7 August, the New Zealand Infantry Brigade {{commenced}} its assault on Chunuk Bair, the crest of the range, along what was known as Rhododendron Ridge. However, delays in getting the infantry battalions to their starting positions meant that the attack was launched in daylight rather than in the planned night time attack. As a result, heavy losses were incurred amongst the Auckland Infantry Battalion. Johnston, still in command of the brigade despite being clearly unfit for it, ordered Malone to take his battalion forward. Malone refused, arguing that his battalion could take Chunuk Bair that night. His refusal to advance in daylight meant that by the end of the day, his battalion was the only intact battalion in the brigade.|$|E

25|$|Other {{types of}} gates, namely AND gates and OR gates, can be {{constructed}} using a majority gate with fixed polarization on one of its inputs. A NOT gate, on the other hand, is fundamentally different from the majority gate, as shown in Figure 6. The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> design is that the input is split and both resulting inputs impinge obliquely on the output. In contrast with an orthogonal placement, the electric field effect of this input structure forces a reversal of polarization in the output.|$|E
25|$|Combining {{the brain}} bias towards facial {{processing}} and surface discovery, a follow-up study by Dr. Vuilleumier exposed subjects to paired visual stimuli in three phases. In the initial phase, stimuli were simply bilateral pairs, and extinction frequency was measured. In the next stage, the stimuli were surrounded with an oval, {{so that they}} appeared to represent eyes in a face. The extinction rate for this appearance was greatly reduced. Finally, the patients were shown the stimuli minus the contextual oval – however, the reduced extinction rate persisted, as though the patients had learned to group these stimuli. The effect did not occur when the stimuli were surrounded by a nonoval shape, pointing towards facial processing as being the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> phenomenon.|$|E

25|$|On September 16, Truscott's {{trial began}} in the then Supreme Court of Ontario in Goderich before Mr. Justice Ferguson and a jury. Steven Truscott was {{represented}} by Frank Donnelly; Glen Hays appeared for the Crown. All the evidence presented in court against the accused was circumstantial, and centred on placing Harper's death within a narrow time frame which implicated Truscott. <b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> narrow window was the autopsy doctor's testimony that the decomposition of Lynne's body {{and the state of}} partially digested food in her stomach indicated she had died near the precise time she was acknowledged to have been with Truscott. On September 30, the jury returned a verdict of guilty, with a recommendation for mercy. Mr. Justice Ferguson, then sentenced Truscott to death (to hang).|$|E
25|$|A {{defensive}} strategy {{becomes more}} {{apparent in the}} later part of Alfred's reign. It was built around the possession of fortified places and the close pursuit of the Danes to harass them and impede their preferred occupation of plundering. Alfred and his lieutenants were able to fight the Danes to a standstill by their repeated ability to pursue and closely besiege them in fortified camps at Nottingham, Wareham, Exeter, Chippenham, Rochester, Milton, Appledore, Thorney, Buttington, Chester and Hertford. It {{was only in the}} later part of Edward the Elder's reign that we see a type of war which a twelfth Century soldier would have recognised. In this phase of the war the West Saxons conquered land by building and holding burhs from which to threaten and dominate Danish territory. The fortification of sites at Witham, Buckingham, Towcester and Colchester persuaded the Danes of the surrounding regions to submit. The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> warfare was sieges and the control of fortified places. It is clear that the new fortresses had permanent garrisons, and that they were supported by the inhabitants of the existing burhs when danger threatened. This is brought out most clearly in the description of the campaigns of 917 in the Chronicle, but throughout the conquest of the Danelaw by Edward and Æthelflæd it is clear that a sophisticated and coordinated strategy was being applied.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s an {{estimated}} 50 million cases of smallpox {{occurred in the}} world each year. To eradicate smallpox, each outbreak had to be stopped from spreading, by isolation of cases and vaccination of everyone who lived close by. This process is known as [...] "ring vaccination". The <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> strategy was the monitoring of cases in a community (known as surveillance) and containment. The initial problem the WHO team faced was inadequate reporting of smallpox cases, as many cases {{did not come to}} the attention of the authorities. The fact that humans are the only reservoir for smallpox infection, and that carriers did not exist, played a significant role in the eradication of smallpox. The WHO established a network of consultants who assisted countries in setting up surveillance and containment activities. Early on, donations of vaccine were provided primarily by the Soviet Union and the United States, but by 1973, more than 80 percent of all vaccine was produced in developing countries.|$|E
500|$|<b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{sequence}} is the Codex Amiatinus, an almost complete Bible {{for which we}} have a very precise terminus ante quem, and within which, because of its size, developments in style can be seen in a single manuscript. [...] The Codex Amiatinus can be precisely located as leaving Wearmouth-Jarrow with a party led by Abbot Ceolfrith on 4 June 716, bound for Rome. [...] The codex was to be presented to Pope Gregory II, a decision only announced by Ceolfrith very shortly before the departure, allowing the dedication page to be dated with confidence to around May 716, though the rest of the manuscript was probably already some years old, but only begun after Ceolfrith succeeded as abbot in 689. [...] The script of the dedication page differs slightly from that of the main text, but is by the same hand and in the same [...] "elaborated text uncial" [...] style as some pages at Durham (MS A II 17, part ii, ff 103-11). [...] At the end of the sequence, {{it may be possible to}} date the Saint Petersburg Bede to 746 at the earliest, from references in memoranda in the text, although this remains a matter of controversy.|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. Tim Stack for Entertainment Weekly reviewed the episode positively, deeming it potentially {{even better than}} the season premiere. Stack wrote that the best aspect of the episode was the focus placed on previously more minor characters, such as Puck, Mercedes and Kurt. He praised Lynch as Sue and wrote, [...] "Stephen Tobolowsky’s Sandy is also {{becoming one of the}} most reliable characters for great lines and laughs." [...] He was disappointed that Garber did not sing in his role as Will's father, but hoped he would return for future episodes. Ryan Brockington for the New York Post stated that [...] "the <b>key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> show lies directly within the female leads", praising Michele as Rachel, Agron as Quinn and Riley as Mercedes, noting that in [...] "Acafellas", Riley [...] "finally got a chance to shine". Raymund Flandez of The Wall Street Journal praised Riley's rendition of [...] "Bust Your Windows" [...] as [...] "showstopping", Vocal Adrenaline's [...] "Mercy" [...] as [...] "leg-splits-over-shoulders exciting", and deemed the Acafellas performance of [...] "I Wanna Sex You Up" [...] "corny" [...] but noted: [...] "this is about high school. Corny is de rigueur." [...] Shawna Malcom for the Los Angeles Times wrote that although [...] "Bust Your Windows" [...] was [...] "over the top [...] the emotion behind the whole thing felt appropriately real." ...|$|E

2500|$|<b>Key</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> {{concept is}} the Hedonic Hypothesis, {{which states that}} {{individuals}} initiate use of the substance or behaviour for their pleasurable effects, but then take it compulsively to avoid withdrawal symptoms, resulting in dependence.
