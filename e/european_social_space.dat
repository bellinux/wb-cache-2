40|$|The issue, {{the period}} and the sources The {{purpose of this article}} is to explore two closely related questions: ❑ How did the theme of {{vocational}} train-ing come to form part of François Mitter-rand’s idea of a <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>space</b> be-tween 1981 and 1984 ? ❑ Over this same period, what factors made vocational training- for young people in particular- a priority of French European social policy? Why the focus on the period 1981 - 1984 ? Is this decision justified? In 1981 the left came to power in France. After being out of government for more than 20 years, this event was in itself a significant political turning point (Berstein, 1998). And 1984, although of lesser importance, was al-so a turning point since François Mitterrand carried out a major change in government following a serious social crisis centred on the conflict in education (Bertinotti, 2001) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to show the {{relationship}} between co-development projects with transnational interests and the governance of migration by the Spanish and Ecuadorian governments. On one hand, the emergence of co-development is linked with the political dimension of migration, and therefore, with the challenges that its management poses for both the sending and receiving states. Simultaneously, the state exists in a context of the reconfiguration of its traditional functions, and above all, the manner in which it goes about performing them. For these reasons, co-development projects form part of state governance strategies, based on a special understanding of the nexus between migration and development in <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>space,</b> involving international organizations, state governments, and civil society, linked by migratory flows. This is demonstrated in the case of Ecuador and Spain. Since Spain stimulated co-development, the implementation of projects with Ecuador has been emphasized, due to the dimensions achieved by Ecuadorian migration. Co-development politics and projects are analyzed in this paper as areas of intervention integrated by values, guide lines and cultural understandings about migration, including appropriate forms of control and management...|$|E

40|$|Tentative {{conclusions}} on {{the role}} of women in science and technology from the contributing studies are the following. First, even though they were limited to European societies and some developed non-European countries, these studies also identify gender differentiation as an undeniably universal phenomenon. The universality of gender differences was already noticed in earlier, especially comparative, studies. In our opinion, the contribution of this book is that it can encourage systematic comparisons of gender differentiation patterns, and not only comparisons of individual data or indicators, and that these comparisons may be continuously expanded to cover an increasing number of European and other countries. Second, in the light of these studies, gender inequalities prove to be impregnated with the effects of the given society, its economic, political, technoscientific and socio-cultural specificities. This is most obvious in cross-county comparisons, proving that relations between economic and technoscientific development on one hand, and gender (in) equality on the other, have no simple, regular, or even easily interpretable patterns. <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>space,</b> not to mention global space, is highly differentiated in terms of gender inequality, and certain types of European societies can also be identified and can be related to their socio-historical background (the post-socialist societies, for example). Third, despite the gender differences in research performance corroborated here, these same differences were also relativised by the findings of two very different scientific and social milieux, with far-reaching cognitive and social implications. These findings imply that simple comparisons of the number and visibility of publications should give way to more complex comparisons and studies on the efficiency and purpose of the publication strategies of men and women scientists, and also to re-examining the evaluation criteria for scientists' production. Fourth, it has been shown that, in terms of theory and methodology, the application, modification and development of theoretical models created in STS, but also in other social sciences, crucially directs empirical studies of gender differentiation in science and technology, thus enriching them with more relevant empirical insights. Fifth, although this book does not aim to offer a set of immediately applicable results for science and/or gender policy, all of its findings have a socially applicable dimension. This refers to the analysis of gender policy conceived and introduced by a powerful science funding agency whose experiences go beyond the national level, but also to all other studies from which recommendations for improving women’ s positions and roles in science and technology can be derived...|$|E
40|$|From the Introduction]. The European Convention and the {{preparations}} for the new Treaty have launched {{a new round of}} debates regarding the future of Europe, European unification and consequently the European social policy. It was obvious that the discussions about the essence of the European political institutions and structures, culminating on the issue of intergovernmentalism or federalism, would certainly have had a serious impact in the pursue of the social construction of Europe. Under these circumstances, the current form of development and implementation of the European employment and social policy which is going mostly through the Open Method of Coordination (OMC) inaugurated in an integrated way by the Lisbon Council of 2000 and after, has found a new context of appraisal of its results, of its nature as well as of its future. The title as well as the concept of the present conference should be perceived as a reflection of the overall political developments. As the historical experience shows, the process and the progress of Europeanization, by itself, brings back continuously to the foreground the issue of the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> <b>space,</b> in other words, the issue of Europe as a social union. In our paper we attempt to raise a number of questions about the prospects of social federalism in Europe taking into consideration the experiences accumulated by other federal states, as these are presented in the recent scientific literature. We will seek to link these experiences with the evolution of the European social policy as the latter is developed after the adoption of the OMC in the field of employment and social protection. Finally, we will attempt to locate several common issues of future initiatives. It is obvious that the projection of the federalist social experience onto social-political design with the form of OMC that takes place within non-federalist social structures, it appears as an extremely difficult undertaking. For this reason, our main aim is mostly to articulate some questions –not all– and to attempt to provide some preliminary answers. The first question that I want to pose refers to what we mean with the term social federalism, within the European context. This is a prerequisite so as to form a common base of understanding and dialogue. The second question, which includes a series of sub-questions, refers to the experience of social federalism in other countries. What conclusions, if any, can we draw from these, and what is their use for the European social policy? Does social federalism contribute to higher levels of social protection? Or is an impediment to the development and expansion of the welfare state? A third cluster of questions is related with the OMC and its role in formulating the future profile of the European social policy. In this particular context we pose some questions. Why just OMC? How can we estimate its contribution in the development of European social policy and European integration? Is OMC capable of producing results? What is its future development and its potential "federal content"? Finally, a fourth question is related with the form that a future OMC should take in order to support a federal social policy, as well as the conditions under which such an OMC would be successful. These are some of the many questions that we would like to pick for our discussion in the frame of a provocative and, we hope, fruitful framework of the conference about the relations between social federalism, subsidiarity and open method of coordination...|$|E

ABSTRACT: The {{evolution of}} the European Union law and {{of the right to}} religious freedom lies in the global process of internationalization of fundamental rights, the transformation of relations between States, the modification of the idea of sovereignty, the emergence of new conventional instruments. With reference to the <b>European</b> <b>social</b> and legal <b>space,</b> the transformation of the European Economic Community into a real political union has allowed the inalienable human rights of the people to become central in the process of integration. Because of that, the political and legal system of the European Union, characterized by the transition of the State monopoly of sovereignty to its sharing among different subjects, has affected the reality of relations between public powers and religious phenomenon. A particular configuration of the concept of secularism in the European continent has been established, by virtue, which the values of democracy, pluralism, human dignity and non-identification between public functions and religious experience would allow for peaceful coexistence between religion, institutional activity of the European Union and fundamental freedoms...|$|R

40|$|In European and {{national}} strategic documents, even Slovene ones, emphasis in physical and regional development, which is aligned to principles of sustainable development, is on goals and directions for balanced spatial development, while contemporary urbanisation processes, conditioned by global competitiveness of the post-industrial age, underline {{the leading role}} of large urban centres. On the other hand structural transformations in Europe are increasingly changing spatial relations between states, regions, cities and agglomerations. With growth of economic and infrastructure flows and strategic enforcement of transnational authority a uniform <b>European</b> economic and <b>social</b> <b>space</b> is emerging, in which different integrations are substituting the role of states. We are deliberating on the necessity of changing the viewpoint on prospective development of cities and urban regions, whereby focus of spatial policies and strategies is on integral dealings with space. Conditions for successful, competitive urban economy can be established only by connecting economic policies with other spatially-relevant departmental policies (transport, environment, agriculture etc.); with general welfare as the goal, another component is becoming significantly closer, which is social cohesion. In different chapters the article presents various global, regional and local factors and in European circumstances identifies the most typical factors affecting roles and functions in city development. Starting from various theoretical embarkation points and selected practical examples from different urban environments, the article tries to define possibilities for identifying initiatives and recommendations for designing development policies and strategies that are essential even in Slovene circumstances...|$|R
