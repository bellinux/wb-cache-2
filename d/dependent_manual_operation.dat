After developing requirements and a concept development plan, DFRC replaced one multiple-CPU mainframe with five specialized servers, distributing the processing workload and separating functions. Access to flight data was improved by buying and building client server automated retrieval software that {{takes advantage of the}} local area network, and by providing over 500 gigabytes of on-line archival storage space. Engineering customers see improved access times and continuous availability (7 -days per week, 24 -hours per day) of flight research data. A significant reduction in computer operator workload was achieved, and minimal computer operator intervention is now required for flight data retrieval operations. This new post-flight system architecture was designed and built to provide flexibility, extensibility and cost-effective upgradeability. Almost two years of successful operation have proven the viability of the system. Future improvements will focus on decreasing the elapsed time between raw data capture and engineering unit data archival, increasing the on-line archival storage capacity, and decreasing the automated data retrieval response time...|$|R
40|$|In {{the recent}} years, high {{prevalence}} of pelvic floor dysfunctions {{has led to}} more and more research work focus on the biological and biomechanical behavior of the related muscles and their relationships with the other pelvic organs [1]. Magnetic resonance imaging, due to some important issues, such as safety and enhanced resolution of soft tissues, is a preferred imaging modality for those works. However, the information provided in each slice (2 D image) discards the spatial continuity between the neighbored slices. Consequently, medical technicians cannot obtain an intuitive and comprehensive understanding of the imaging organs through the acquired 3 D slice volumes. Accurate 3 D models of pelvic organs, mainly of the pelvic floor muscles, are needed to assist a thorough scope on the structures in the pelvic cavity and are valuable for clinical diagnosis. The normal way to obtain 3 D models from 3 D slice volumes is to first sketch the boundaries of the different organs (or structures) in each 2 D slice, and then use the sequential contours to build the surfaces. Nevertheless, the complex background in MR images of pelvic cavity should be carefully handled. Additionally, the influence of noise and partial volume effect (PVE) tend to blur the boundaries of organs and structures. Usually, this feature makes the segmentation mainly <b>dependent</b> on <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> There are some algorithms already proposed to segment certain pelvic structure...|$|R
40|$|This work {{demonstrates}} {{the use of}} genetic algorithms in optimized view planning for 3 D reconstruction applications using small unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The quality of UAV site models is currently highly <b>dependent</b> on <b>manual</b> pilot <b>operations</b> or grid-based automation solutions. When applied to 3 D structures, these approaches can result in gaps in the total coverage or inconsistency in final model resolution. Genetic algorithms can effectively explore the search space to locate image positions that produce high quality models in terms of coverage and accuracy. A fitness function is defined, and optimization parameters are selected through semi-exhaustive search. A novel simulation environment for evaluating view plans is demonstrated using terrain generation software. The view planning algorithm is tested in two separate simulation cases: a water drainage structure and a reservoir levee, as representative samples of infrastructure monitoring. The optimized flight plan is compared against three alternate flight plans in each case. The optimized view plan is found to yield terrain models with up to 43 % greater accuracy than a standard grid flight pattern, while maintaining comparable coverage and completeness...|$|R

40|$|AbstractManual tasks play an {{important}} role in social sustainable manufacturing enterprises. Commonly, <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> are used for low volume productions, but are not limited to. Operational models in manufacturing systems based on “x-to-order” paradigms (e. g. assembly-to-order) may require <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> to speed-up the ramp-up time of new product configuration assemblies. The implications of <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> in any production line may imply that any manufacturing or assembly process become more susceptible to human errors and therefore translate into delays, defects and/or poor product quality. In this scenario, virtual and augmented realities can offer significant advantages to support the human operator in <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> This research work presents the development of a mixed (virtual and augmented) reality assistance system that permits real-time support in <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> A review of mixed reality techniques and technologies was conducted, where it was determined to use a projection mapping solution for the proposed assistance system. According to the specific requirements of the demonstration environment, hardware and software components were chosen.

40|$|This is {{a conference}} paper. In high-value {{manufacturing}} sectors, many manufacturing processes are still performed manually, such as polishing operations for small metallic parts. Increasing volume, {{the need for}} consistency in quality, and health and safety issues {{are some of the}} reasons for industry to search urgently for alternative solutions for manual polishing processes. This article reports the development of an intelligent automated polishing system to achieve consistent surface quality and removal of superficial defects from high-value components, such as those used in aerospace industry. The article reports an innovative method to capture manual polishing processes by skilled operators. The captured polishing parameters are then used to develop and control a robotic polishing system that can adopt various polishing patterns. A brief summary of existing fully and semi-automated polishing systems and their inadequacy for industrial applications are discussed. The need for building automation system based on <b>manual</b> <b>operations</b> are explained and a systematic data capturing process for a specific aerospace-based component is defined. The development of the process capturing device is explained, the data analysis and interpretations are discussed and the migration from <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> to an automated polishing system is reported. Further detailed information is given in relation with combining data from various sensors and building of an automated system based on learning from <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> The research results are also briefly discussed and conclusions are drawn regarding applicability of automated systems for highly skilled <b>manual</b> <b>operations...</b>|$|R

40|$|International audienceA simple {{assembly}} line balancing problem is considered provided that number m of working stations is fixed. In such a problem, denoted as SALBP- 2, {{it is necessary}} to minimize a cycle time for processing a partially ordered set of operations V = { 1, 2, [...] ., n} on a set of m linearly ordered (working) stations. An initial vector of the processing times t of the operations V is given. And for each automated operation, the processing time cannot vary during a life cycle of the {{assembly line}}. For each <b>manual</b> <b>operation,</b> the processing times may vary, since different workers may have different skill, experience, etc. We investigate a stability of the optimal line balance of the simple assembly line with respect to simultaneous variations of the processing times of the <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> An optimal line balance is stable if it remains optimal for any sufficiently small variations of the processing times of the <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> We propose an algorithm and a program in C++ for constructing all the stable optimal line balances for the problem SALBP- 2.

40|$|Camera {{calibration}} plays {{a critical}} role in 3 D computer vision tasks. The most commonly used calibration method utilizes a planar checkerboard and can be done nearly fully automatically. However, it requires the user to move either the camera or the checkerboard during the capture step. This <b>manual</b> <b>operation</b> is time consuming and makes the calibration results unstable. In order to solve the above problems caused by <b>manual</b> <b>operation,</b> this paper presents a full-automatic camera calibration method using a virtual pattern instead of a physical one. The virtual pattern is actively transformed and displayed on a screen so that the control points of the pattern can be uniformly observed in the camera view. The proposed method estimates the camera parameters from point correspondences between 2 D image points and the virtual pattern. The camera and the screen are fixed during the whole process; therefore, the proposed method does not require any <b>manual</b> <b>operations.</b> Performance of the proposed method is evaluated through experiments on both synthetic and real data. Experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve stable results and its accuracy is comparable to the standard method by Zhang...|$|R
