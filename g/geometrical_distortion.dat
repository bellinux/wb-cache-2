In consideration of the complexity and cost of existing correction methods which need camera to collect the feedback images, another algorithm was proposed to correct <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion.</b> Firstly, the pixels of the uncorrected image were mapped to the cylindrical screen with equal-arc length method. Then the correction of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion</b> was realized by transforming the pixels on the cylindrical screen to the 2 D coordinate of pre-corrected image according to perspective projection.

Factors such as registration, MR geometrical distortions and accuracy of digitizing device, are theoretically described in a general model of IGNS. The means of registering the patient to its image data is then studied, starting with the definition of registration error. Computer simulations of registration by homologous point matching are described along with a clinical study comparing homologous point matching and surface matching registration methods. A 3 -D MR <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion</b> experiment performed on a stereotactic frame is presented. These measurements demonstrate the discrepancy that can be observed in the geometry of the frame when imaged with differing read-out gradient directions, and quantitatively evaluate the <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion</b> associated with the image of the frame of known geometry. Since <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion</b> of MR images can adversely affect the accuracy of IGNS, the three-point-Dixon MR pulse sequence is evaluated as a means of estimating the magnetic field inhomogeneity, and hence potential geometrical errors in images. Finally, an experimental comparison of mechanical and optical localizing devices is described, resulting in a quantitative estimate of the precision and accuracy of both systems...|$|E

The embedding of the signature is done by extracting feature points of the image and performing a Delaunay tessellation on the set of points. The mark is embedded using a classical additive scheme inside each triangle of the tessellation. The detection is done using correlation properties on the different triangles. The performance of the presented scheme is evaluated after JPEG compression, geometrical attack and transformations.

40|$|The {{commonly}} used radial distortion model for camera calibration {{is in fact}} an assumption or a restriction. In practice, camera distortion could happen in a general geometrical manner that {{is not limited to}} the radial sense. This paper proposes a simplified <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion</b> modeling method by using two different radial distortion functions in the two image axes. A family of simplified geometric distortion models is proposed, which are either simple polynomials or the rational functions of polynomials. Analytical geometric undistortion is possible using two of the distortion functions discussed in this paper and their performance can be improved by applying a piecewise fitting idea. Our experimental results show that the <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortion</b> models always perform better than their radial distortion counterparts. Furthermore, the proposed geometric modeling method is more appropriate for cameras whose distortion is not perfectly radially symmetric around the center of distortion.

40|$|PURPOSE: Knowledge on low {{frequency}} (LF) tissue conductivity is relevant for various biomedical purposes. To obtain this information, LF phase maps arising from time-varying imaging gradients {{have been demonstrated}} to create a LF conductivity contrast. Essential in this methodology is the subtraction of phase images acquired with opposite gradient polarities to separate LF and RF phase effects. Here we demonstrate how sensitive these subtractions are with respect to <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortions.</b> THEORY AND METHODS: The effect of <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortions</b> on LF phase maps is mathematically defined. After quantifying typical <b>geometrical</b> <b>distortions,</b> their effects on LF phase maps are evaluated using conductive phantoms. For validation, electromagnetic simulations of LF phase maps were performed. RESULTS: Even sub-voxel distortions of 10 % of the voxel size, measured for a typical LF MR sequence, cause leakage of RF phase into LF phase of several milli-radians, leading to a misleading pattern of LF phase maps. This leakage is mathematically confirmed, while simulations indicate that the expected LF phase should be in order of micro-radians. CONCLUSION: The conductivity scaling of LF phase maps is attributable to the RF phase leakage, thus dependent on the RF conductivity. In fact, simulations show that the LF phase is not measurable.
