40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} if there is a difference in the way male and female authors of contemporary realistic fiction for young adults portray decision making by their male or female protagonists. Questions asked in the study were: (1) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice or an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care for male protagonists involved in moral decision making? (2) Do female writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice or an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making? (3) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice or an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care for male protagonists involved in moral decision making? and (4) Do male writers of contemporary young adult realistic fiction employ an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice or an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making? Content analysis was used as the method of collecting data. The sample consisted of 194 novels written from 1989 to 1998, 53 of which contained a moral dilemma. A discussion of the novels included examples of moral dilemmas, alternative solutions, dilemma resolutions, and resolutions based upon care or justice. Analysis of the data revealed: (1) Female writers employ an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care and an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice for male protagonists involved in moral decision making. (2) Female writers prefer an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care for female protagonists involved in moral decision making. (3) Male writers prefer an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice for male protagonists involved in moral decision making. (4) Male writers prefer an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice for female protagonists involved in moral decision making...|$|R
40|$|This article {{encourages}} {{community college}} leaders to employ ethical paradigms when constructing and considering alternative courses of action in decision-making processes. The authors discuss four previously articulated paradigms (e. g., <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> justice, <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> critique, <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care, and <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> the profession) and propose an additional paradigm—the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> local community. The <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> local community is a communitarian and utilitarian frame embodied by the philosophical underpinnings and mission of the community college. Questions designed for praxis are proffered following a discourse on how each paradigm is defined and described in extant literature.

5|$|Palmer {{does not}} {{explicitly}} connect Environmental Ethics and Process Thought to Animal Ethics in Context, her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, {{insofar as it}} offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics. In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> harming animals, Palmer asks, in Animal Ethics in Context, about the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> aiding animals, {{with a focus on}} the distinction between wild and domestic animals. She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a prima facie duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.|$|E

40|$|The <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> {{criticism}} has {{stood at the}} heart of western pedagogy for centuries. It has been the basis of science, morality and art {{as well as for the}} building of social and political institutions. The author argues that this <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> criticism is sometimes at odds with the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care, one that commits the carer to look after and take responsibility for the well-being of the cared-for. This <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care is further undermined by contemporary consumerism and its inroads into the fields of education and learning. The resulting perception of management as a field of study for young people is entirely instrumental— an effective stepping stone to launch a career, but one devoid of either intrinsic interest or social value. The author makes a plea for an enduring reconciliation <b>of</b> an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> care with an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> criticism as the basis for management education that is both interesting and socially useful...|$|R
5|$|Bartolomé de las Casas spent 50 {{years of}} his life {{actively}} fighting slavery and the violent colonial abuse of indigenous peoples, especially by trying to convince the Spanish court to adopt a more humane policy of colonization. Unlike the other priests who sought to destroy all of the indigenous peoples native books and writings, he was strictly opposed to this action. Although he failed to save the indigenous peoples of the Western Indies, his efforts resulted in several improvements in the legal status of the natives, and in an increased colonial focus on the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> colonialism. Las Casas is often seen {{as one of the first}} advocates for universal conception of human dignity (later human rights).|$|E
5|$|Contrasting against Caravaggio's sensual {{baskets of}} fruit, Chardin's plush peaches, or Cézanne's vibrant {{arrangements}} of apples, the mundane Campbell's Soup Cans gave {{the art world}} a chill. Furthermore, the idea of isolating eminently recognizable pop culture items was ridiculous enough to the art world that both the merits and <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> the work were perfectly reasonable debate topics {{for those who had}} not even seen the piece. Warhol's pop art {{can be seen as a}} relation to Minimal art in the sense that it attempts to portray objects in their most simple, immediately recognizable form. Pop art eliminates overtones and undertones that would otherwise be associated with representations.|$|E
5|$|French {{psychoanalyst}} Jacques Lacan linked psychoanalysis with Kantian {{ethics in}} his works The <b>Ethics</b> <b>of</b> Psychoanalysis and Kant avec Sade and compared Kant with the Marquis de Sade. Lacan argued that Sade's maxim of jouissance—the pursuit of sexual pleasure or enjoyment—is morally acceptable by Kant's criteria {{because it can}} be universalised. He proposed that, while Kant presented human freedom as critical to the moral law, Sade further argued that human freedom is only fully realised through the maxim of jouissance.|$|E
40|$|Weber’s {{discussion}} <b>of</b> <b>ethics</b> in {{his famous}} lecture (and then essay) Politics as a Vocation (1919) clearly indicates that two possible ethical stances, the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> conviction and the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility, are rooted in ‘distinct and irreconcilably opposed principles’. Throughout Politics as a Vocation, it is the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility {{that appears to be}} endorsed by Weber as suited for political life. Yet, Weber concludes his essay by claiming that a combined ethic is ideal for a political vocation. This makes Weber’s position regarding the ideal ethical stance for a man who has a ‘true political calling’ appear contradictory: the ethics are opposites but somehow to be combined. Commentators have mostly concluded that, for Weber, the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility is the ideal ethic for politics. That appears further in accord with the fact that a key concern of the speech in its historical context was to warn political students of the dangers associated with an <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> conviction. Weber, as a realist, was especially critical of a stance that disregarded the corrupted nature of the world, which the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility alone seems to accept. Politicians with single-minded convictions were responsible for Germany’s political stalemate, supporting the fact that the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> conviction should not be deemed acceptable in politics. And yet there is much this position neglects by opting for only one <b>of</b> the two <b>ethics,</b> by concluding that only the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility is appropriate for political vocation. My thesis offers something different; something I admit is ambitious. What I propose is the synthesis of the opposition, of finding a way to combine the two irreconcilably opposed ethics...|$|R

5|$|Hadley has {{considered}} the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> humans' relationships with wild animals and environments beyond his property rights theory. He argues {{that there is}} a duty to aid wild animals in need, and that these duties are essentially no different to humans' duties to aid distant strangers who are severely cognitively impaired. He argues that libertarian property rights, consistent with Robert Nozick's interpretation of the Lockean proviso, should limit the right to destroy human-owned natural environments.|$|E
5|$|Kant's {{conception}} of duty does not entail that people perform their duties grudgingly. Although duty often constrains people and prompts {{them to act}} against their inclinations, it still comes from an agent's volition: they desire to keep the moral law. Thus, when an agent performs an action from duty {{it is because the}} rational incentives matter to them more than their opposing inclinations. Kant wished to move beyond the conception morality as externally imposed duties and present an <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> autonomy, when rational agents freely recognise the claims reason makes upon them.|$|E

40|$|The article {{addresses}} the question: ‘To what extent can Max Weber’s <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility be a helpful resource {{in the search}} <b>of</b> Christian Social <b>Ethics</b> for an appropriate contemporary approach’?

The conclusion is that although some aspects of Weber’s view on the <b>ethic</b> <b>of</b> responsibility are unacceptable to Christian Social <b>Ethics,</b> the core <b>of</b> it is commendable.

5|$|Religions {{vary widely}} in {{their views of}} the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> birth control.

Views in Judaism range from the stricter Orthodox sect to the more relaxed Reform sect. Hindus may use both natural and artificial contraceptives. A common Buddhist view is that preventing conception is acceptable, while intervening after conception has occurred is not. In Islam, contraceptives are allowed if they do not threaten health, although their use is discouraged by some.|$|E

In developing countries the impact of HIV/AIDS has been profound; key organisations such as healthcare, defense and civil services have been severely disrupted. Life expectancy has fallen. In Zimbabwe, for example, life expectancy was 79 years in 1991 but by 2001 it had fallen to 39 years.|$|E

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and if all the arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the <b>ethics</b> <b>of</b> growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
