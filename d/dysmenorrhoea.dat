50|$|Most women, at {{some time}} in their lives, {{experience}} pelvic pain.

According to the CDC, Chronic pelvic pain (CPP) accounted for approximately 9% of all visits to gynecologists in 2007. In addition, CPP is the reason for 20—30% of all laparoscopies in adults. Pelvic girth pain is frequent during pregnancy.|$|E
50|$|During {{the second}} half of the 19th century many women were treated using {{bilateral}} oophorectomy for conditions recognised today such as amenorrhoea, <b>dysmenorrhoea,</b> menometrorrhagia, and various conditions that were variously referred to at the time as pelvic neurosis, oophoromania, oophoralgia, menstrual molimina (premenstrual syndrome), ovarian epilepsy and sexuologic (nymphomania) disorders. Battey himself is credited by E.P.

5000|$|In {{other parts}} of the world, P. incarnata is used for the {{treatment}} of partially different diseases.

In India however, it has been used to treat morphine dependence, but in Vietnam sleeplessness, anxiety and high blood pressure have been treated with extracts from this plant. In the Middle East P. incarnata has again slightly different applications, for example in Turkey, <b>dysmenorrhoea,</b> epilepsy, insomnia, neurosis and neuralgia are treated with P. incarnata. But it has also been used as a sedative and narcotic medicine in Iraq. [...] "In the African countries of Rwanda, Kenya and Congo P. incarnata is used as a folk remedy by herbalists and natural health practitioners for its sedative, nervine, anti-spasmodic and analgesic effects.

5000|$|The {{plant was}} an {{important}} treatment among the Native Americans and among the Eclectic medicine physicians for reproductive conditions.Scudder wrote:The Senecio exerts a specific influence upon the reproductive organs of the female, and {{to a less extent}} upon the male.

[...] It may be prescribed in all cases in which there is an atonic condition of ovaries or uterus, with derangement of function. It makes little difference whether it is amenorrhoea, <b>dysmenorrhoea</b> or menorrhagia, or whether it takes the form of increased mucous or purulent secretion, or displacement. The remedy acts slowly, and sufficient time must be given.In the male we prescribe it in cases of fullness and weight in the perineum, dragging sensations in the testicle, and difficult or tardy urination. In both male and female we sometimes use it with advantage in painful micturition with tenesmus.|$|E
