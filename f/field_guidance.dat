[...] He argues that Hwang Pyong-so, the First Deputy Head of the OGD, through his post as Director of the General Political Bureau of the Korean People's Army, is the real ruler of the country because (Jang believes) he controls the appointments and dismissals of military officers. He concludes that Kim Jong-un will remain a puppet as long as Kim Jong-il's old proteges still control the OGD.

Our method can be easily combined with most current local collision-avoidance methods and we use two such methods as examples to highlight the potential of our approach.

40|$|In visual search, {{observers}} {{try to find}} known target objects among distractors {{in visual}} scenes where {{the location of the}} targets is uncertain. This review article discusses the attentional processes that are active during search and their neural basis. Four successive phases of visual search are described. During the initial preparatory phase, a representation of the current search goal is activated. Once visual input has arrived, information about the presence of target-matching features is accumulated in parallel across the visual <b>field</b> (<b>guidance).</b> This information is then used to allocate spatial attention to particular objects (selection), before representations of selected objects are activated in visual working memory (recognition). These four phases of attentional control in visual search are characterized both at the cognitive level and at the neural implementation level. It will become clear that search is a continuous process that unfolds in real time. Selective attention in visual search is described as the gradual emergence of spatially specific and temporally sustained biases for representations of task-relevant visual objects in cortical maps...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a coordinated standoff tracking methodology of groups of moving targets using multiple UAVs. The vector <b>field</b> <b>guidance</b> approach is first applied to track {{a group of}} targets for a single UAV by defining a variable standoff orbit to be followed, which can keep all targets within the field-of view of the UAV. A new feedforward term {{is included in the}} guidance command considering variable standoff distance, and the convergence of the vector field to the standoff orbit is analysed and enhanced by adjusting radial velocity using two active measures associated with vector field generation. Moreover, for multiple group tracking by multiple UAVs, a two-phase approach is proposed as a suboptimal solution for an NP-hard problem, consisting of target clustering/assignment and cooperative standoff group tracking with online local replanning. Lastly, localisation sensitivity to the group of targets is investigated for different angular separations between UAVs and sensing configurations. Numerical simulations are performed using randomly moving ground vehicles with four UAVs to verify the feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
40|$|Practical Action Publishing, 2016. The definitive, peer-reviewed {{and edited}} {{version of this}} article (Version of Scholarly Record) is {{published}} at: [URL] latrine linings for emergency sanitation facilities require different performance criteria from those for pits used in longer-term development work. Various international initiatives are currently under way to develop new methods of supporting the pits used for latrines in emergencies, but before a solution can be found, the problem needs to be defined. Current <b>field</b> <b>guidance</b> lacks the level of detail required by humanitarian workers to construct durable pits in a timely manner. Consultations with international humanitarian field staff and UK-based geotechnical engineers were used in this research project to identify design, construction, and operational requirements of emergency pit-lining systems. However, rather than closely defined performance requirements, the study identified a wide range of criteria that need to be considered and clear distinctions between emergency and longer-term solutions. Latrines constructed in the initial stages of emergencies are likely to be communal, with long rectangular pits that require frequent emptying. Current knowledge of suitable pit support methods is sufficient to provide a limited range of standard designs that could be selected to meet local requirements...|$|E
