50|$|Keep the Fire Burnin is a {{compilation}} album from American musician/singer/songwriter Dan Hartman. It {{was his first}} album since 1989s New <b>Green</b> <b>Clear</b> Blue, and was released posthumously in 1994, following his death earlier in the year.

5000|$|Following the {{commercial}} failure of his 1989 album New <b>Green</b> <b>Clear</b> Blue, Hartman turned {{once again to}} producing, although he had revealed to be recording a new solo album immediately after the New <b>Green</b> <b>Clear</b> Blue album. By 1994, Hartman began to record a new album of contemporary pop and dance music. While in the studio during 1993, he noted that [...] "So many things have changed {{in terms of social}} and political issues, as well as the need for love and personal relationships. All of these things are the reasons why writing and recording new material is most meaningful to me." [...] In the end, a total of two songs were completed; [...] "Keep the Fire Burnin" [...] and [...] "The Love in Your Eyes". Hartman died on March 22, 1994, from an AIDS-related brain tumor.|$|R
50|$|Shortly {{before the}} album's recording, Hartman {{moved from the}} Schoolhouse, which he rented, and bought his own house, built on multi-levels, {{on the banks of}} the Saugatuck River in Westport. Dan used the small studio at the rear of the house to write and produce the New <b>Green</b> <b>Clear</b> Blue album and also lived there until his passing in 1994.|$|R
50|$|The album {{would become}} Hartman's final {{mainstream}} studio album, {{although he did}} record a follow-up album in 1986 titled White Boy. However MCA felt the songs did not suit Hartman's image and so the album was shelved, {{although it has been}} in circulation unofficially in recent years online. Hartman's final studio album was New <b>Green</b> <b>Clear</b> Blue from 1989, which was an instrumental new age-styled release.|$|R

50|$|White Boy was not {{the first}} album to suffer from {{rejection}} from MCA, as the I Can Dream About You album also had songs that never circulated. Many more songs were written by Hartman and Midnight for I Can Dream About You, but these were rejected by the record company due to the edginess of the music and lyrics. After White Boy was not released, Hartman returned to writing and producing for others, until his death in 1994. His final studio album New <b>Green</b> <b>Clear</b> Blue was released in 1989, and was an instrumental new age-styled album.|$|R
