500|$|Creators Murphy and Falchuk {{began working}} on American Horror Story before their Fox series Glee began production. Murphy {{wanted to do the}} {{opposite}} of what he had done previously and thus began his work on the series. He stated, [...] "I went from Nip/Tuck to Glee, so it made sense that I wanted to do something challenging and dark. And I always had loved, as Brad had, the horror genre. So <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> a natural for me." [...] Falchuk was intrigued by the idea of putting a different angle on the horror genre, stating that their main goal in creating the series was to scare viewers. [...] "You want people {{to be a little bit}} off balance afterwards," [...] he said.|$|E
500|$|Hill {{attended}} Columbia High School, {{where she}} was a member of the track team, a cheerleader and was a classmate of Zach Braff. She also took violin lessons, went to dance class, and founded the school's gospel choir. Academically, she took advanced placement classes and received primarily 'A' grades. School officials recognized her as a leader among the student body. Later recalling her education, Hill commented, [...] "I had a love for – I don't know if it was necessarily for academics, more than <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> for achieving, period. If it was academics, if it was sports, if it was music, if it was dance, whatever it was, I was always driven to do a lot in whatever field or whatever area I was focusing on at the moment." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera {{revealed}} {{that some of}} the inspiration for the music video came from her work in Burlesque, stating, [...] "There is dancing, and I learned so much also as a dancer doing the 'Burlesque' film, moving my body in ways that were, I feel, never as precise before [...] I really fell in love and I adapted that in the dancing for 'Not Myself Tonight,' but it was really, really fun to take what I learned from the movie." [...] She further elaborated, [...] "A lot of that [...] was based on my visual inspiration. I took Hype into my salon area in my home ... it's like my creative den. He took the ideas and then took other ideas and related to the ideas, and <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> really iconic imagery." [...] The video itself features a strong sexual theme with scenes of S and bondage, as well as scenes in a church and several prestigious-looking buildings. Aguilera wore several hairstyles and outfits, including many which were dominatrix-style.|$|E

2500|$|She {{returned}} to North Dakota for a tonsillectomy and was noticed by hotel owner Frank Bering {{while working at}} the Doll House in Palm Springs, California. It was here that she developed her trademark sultry purr – having decided {{to compete with the}} noisy crowd with subtlety rather than volume. Beringin offered her a gig at The Buttery Room, a nightclub in the Ambassador Hotel East in Chicago. There, she was noticed by bandleader Benny Goodman. According to Lee, [...] "Benny's then-fiancée, Lady Alice Duckworth, came into The Buttery, and she was very impressed. So the next evening she brought Benny in, because {{they were looking for a}} replacement for Helen Forrest. And although I didn't know, I was it. He was looking at me strangely, I thought, but it was just his preoccupied way of looking. I thought that he didn't like me at first, but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> that he was preoccupied with what he was hearing." [...] She joined his band in 1941 and stayed for two years.|$|E
2500|$|He {{slowed down}} his {{feelings}} about the album after that saying [...] "I don’t hate Relapse. I don’t hate it at all, but when I’m looking back at an album I do have a tendency, and especially with that album, to run things into the ground. That {{was one of those}} instances where I got in a zone, like, [...] "Yo I just want to be this demented serial killer on this album. And part of that was a growing process to get to Recovery, working through those steps, relearning how to rap, and relearning where I need to be at." [...] He reiterates this statement during his 2013 Q with Rolling Stone saying [...] "I don't hate the record. I want to rap and be able to always try to do my best lyrically, {{but at the same time}} find the right balance between that and making the right songs. And you know, I don't know if I necessarily found that balance yet, because I was just getting sober and just kind of finding my feet again and so there was a lot of songs that were just like [...] "Ha ha this is funny!" [...] You know, walking around and joking around with your friends and shit and it ends up on the record and you're laughing about it. Because when I got sober it was like – I've said this before – but <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> like [...] "Oh shit! I can think straight again!" [...] So I don't know if that record was particularly my best work as far as songs, writing songs that felt like something, that brought some kind of emotion. I ran accents into the grounds. I got stuck on that kind of serial killer, crazy vibe and just kind of went with it.|$|E

6000|$|... "Very right, very right," [...] said Mr. Wentworth, solemnly. He had {{arranged}} {{in his mind}} a little speech; but now it quite faded away. He felt almost frightened. He had never been looked at in just that way--with just that fixed, intense smile--by any woman; and it perplexed and weighed upon him, now, that {{the woman who was}} smiling so and who had instantly given him a vivid sense of her possessing other unprecedented attributes, was his own niece, the child of his own father's daughter. The idea that his niece should be a German Baroness, married [...] "morganatically" [...] to a Prince, had already given him much to think about. Was it right, was <b>it</b> <b>just,</b> <b>was</b> it acceptable? He always slept badly, and the night before he had lain awake much more even than usual, asking himself these questions. The strange word [...] "morganatic" [...] was constantly in his ears; it reminded him of a certain Mrs. Morgan whom he had once known and who had been a bold, unpleasant woman. He had a feeling that it was his duty, so long as the Baroness looked at him, smiling in that way, to meet her glance with his own scrupulously adjusted, consciously frigid organs of vision; but on this occasion he failed to perform his duty to the last. He looked away toward his daughters. [...] "We are very glad to see you," [...] he had said. [...] "Allow me to introduce my daughters--Miss Charlotte Wentworth, Miss Gertrude Wentworth." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{primitive}} type of {{life cycle}} probably had haploid individuals with asexual reproduction.

However, these eukaryotes probably are not primitively asexual, but have lost their sexual reproduction, or <b>it</b> <b>just</b> <b>was</b> not observed yet. Many eukaryotes (including animals and plants) exhibit asexual reproduction, which may be facultative or obligate in the life cycle, with sexual reproduction occurring more or less frequently.|$|E
