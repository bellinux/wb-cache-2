Great interest has been raised to unveil whether this investment into immunity also involves fitness costs associated to the individual or the group. Focusing on the immune {{responses of}} <b>honeybees,</b> we use the well-studied insect bumblebee for comparison. Bumblebees are capable of producing specific immune responses to infections whereas {{this has not been}} assessed for <b>honeybees</b> so far. We investigated whether a prior bacterial encounter provides protection against a later exposure to the same or a different bacterium in <b>honeybees.</b> Additionally, we studied whether the foraging activities of <b>honeybees</b> and bumblebees are affected upon immune stimulation by assessing the flight performance. Finally, the acceptance behavior of nestmates toward immune-challenged <b>honeybees</b> was determined. Results show that despite stimulating the immune system of <b>honeybees,</b> no protective effects to infections were found. Further, <b>honeybees</b> were not affected by an immune challenge in their flight performance whereas bumblebees showed significant flight impairment. Immune-challenged <b>honeybees</b> showed lower survival rates than naive individuals when introduced into a regular colony.

40|$|In plant-pollinator interactions, pollinating insects provide {{reproductive}} {{service to}} plants and receive food rewards. Flowers advertise {{the presence of}} nectar or pollen through various characteristics, including visual displays. In daisies (Chrysanthemum frutescens), {{the center of the}} inflorescence appears as a UV-absorbing bull's-eye that attracts pollinators, for example <b>honeybees.</b> Thomisus spectabilis crab spiders occupy daisies and prey on <b>honeybees.</b> They typically position themselves on the lingulate florets of daisies and create a color contrast that deceives <b>honeybees.</b> <b>Honeybees</b> prefer daisies with a T. spectabilis on the lingulate florets to vacant daisies.

40|$|Abstract. Two rare {{plant species}} {{protected}} by the Biodiversity Law – Astragalus dasyanthus and Haberlea rhodopensis – were observed, so as to list their flower visitors. The behaviour of the <b>honeybees</b> in close vicinity was recorded simultaneously. The aim was to test how they affect the pollination of these two plant species, presuming that <b>honeybees</b> may have neutral to {{negative impact on the}} pollination of rare plants. The observations revealed that <b>honeybees</b> preferred other plants for foraging in the studied communities. Since <b>honeybees</b> do not actually use A. dasyanthus and H. rhodopensis as foraging resources, they neither promote nor reduce the reproduction of these rare plants. Astragalus dasyanthus was actively visited by bumblebees – mainly Bombus hortorum and seldom by other bumblebee species, but not by <b>honeybees.</b> <b>Honeybees</b> were abundant in the vicinity but they collected food from Astragalus onobrychis, Dorycnium herbaceum, Onobrychis arenaria, Thymus sibthorpi,i and some other plants.

5|$|In {{individuals}} {{allergic to}} the venom (about 2–3% of the population), a sting sometimes causes anaphylactic shock. In comparison to other insects {{such as the}} western <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera) and the European wasp (Vespula germanica), their rates are only 1.4% and 0.6%. The annual sting exposure rates for the jack jumper ant, Western <b>honeybee</b> and European wasp are 12%, 7% and 2%. The median time from sting to cardiac arrest is 15 minutes, but the maximum period is around three hours. The ant allergy does not disappear; people with jack jumper allergies will most likely suffer from another allergic reaction if re-stung. Approximately 70 percent of patients {{with a history of}} systemic reaction to the ant's sting have another reaction when stung again. In comparison, systemic reaction figures for Apis mellifera and Vespula germanica after being stung show a rate of 50% and 25%. About half of these reactions were life-threatening and occurred predominantly in people who had had previous incidents with the sting. Anaphylaxis in jack jumper ant stings are not rare; 2.9% of 600 residents from semi-rural Victoria had allergic reactions to the ant's sting, according to a questionnaire. The sensitivity to stings is persistent for many years.|$|E
5|$|Invertebrate {{introductions}} {{have had}} an observable effect on Puerto Rican fauna. Native freshwater snails such as Physa cubensis have been adversely affected by introduced species. Currently, the most abundant freshwater snail in Puerto Rico is the Quilted Melania (Tarebia granifera), an introduced species. Another invertebrate introduced to Puerto Rico is the <b>honeybee.</b> This animal competes with the endangered Puerto Rican parrot for secondary nesting cavities at the Caribbean National Forest. Africanized bees, which pose an even greater threat for secondary cavity nesters, have recently extended their range to Puerto Rico.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comIn many previous studies {{of the effects of}} introduced <b>honeybees</b> on Australian ecosystems, it has been assumed that floral morphology is a primary factor determining whether introduced <b>honeybees</b> will be effective in pollinating endemic plants. Although both <b>honeybees</b> and birds contacted stigmas and anthers of the small-flowered Brachyloma ericoides (Epacridaceae), the exclusion of birds but not <b>honeybees</b> resulted in a significantly lower proportion of flowers producing capsules (12. 3 ± 2 vs 21. 0 ± 2 %). This suggests that native birds contributed significantly to fruit set even though <b>honeybees</b> were much more frequent visitors to flowers (5 – 6 vs 0. 7 – 2. 5 times per day) and moved more frequently between plants (25 vs 12. 2 % of movements).

5|$|The {{extent of}} the jack jumper sting problem differs among areas. Allergy {{prevalence}} rates are significantly lower in highly urbanised areas and much higher in rural areas. These ants represent a hazard towards people in the southern states of Australia, due to {{a high proportion of}} the population having significant allergies to the ant's sting. The ant is a significant cause of major insect allergies, responsible for most anaphylaxis cases in Australia, and rates of anaphylaxis are twice those of <b>honeybee</b> stings.

While the original controllers for the first Guitar Hero game were designed by Ryan Lesser, Rob Kay, Greg LoPiccolo and Alex Rigopulous of Harmonix and built by the <b>Honeybee</b> Corporation of China, subsequent iterations and future controllers were developed inhouse at RedOctane, with development led primarily by Jack McCauley.|$|E

40|$|Bumblebees (Bombus spp.) and <b>honeybees,</b> Apis mellifera, both use odour cues {{deposited}} on flowers by previous visitors {{to improve their}} foraging efficiency.

5|$|Six {{species of}} honeyeater have been {{observed}} feeding at its flowers, as have insects including <b>honeybees,</b> ants, butterflies, beetles and native bees.

5|$|In {{regions of}} the Old World where they are indigenous, honeybees (Apis mellifera) {{are among the most}} {{important}} pollinators, vital to sustain natural habitats there in addition to their value for human societies (to sustain food resources). Where <b>honeybee</b> populations decline, there is also a decline in plant populations. In agriculture, some plants are completely dependent on honeybees to pollinate them to produce fruit, while other plants are only dependent on honeybees to enhance their capacity to produce better and healthier fruits. Honeybees also help plants to reduce time between flowering and fruit set, which reduces risk from harmful factors such as pests, diseases, chemicals, weather, etc. Specialist plants that require honeybees will be at more risk if honeybees decline, whereas generalist plants that use other animals as pollinators (or wind pollinating or self-pollinating) will suffer less because they have other sources of pollination.|$|E
5|$|Nest size {{depends on}} species of bumblebee. Most form colonies of between 50 and 400 individuals, but colonies have been {{documented}} as small as ~20 individuals and as large as 1700. These nests are small compared to <b>honeybee</b> hives, which hold about 50,000 bees. Many species nest underground, choosing old rodent burrows or sheltered places, and avoiding places that receive direct sunlight {{that could result in}} overheating. Other species make nests above ground, whether in thick grass or in holes in trees. A bumblebee nest is not organised into hexagonal combs like that of a honeybee; the cells are instead clustered together untidily. The workers remove dead bees or larvae from the nest and deposit them outside the nest entrance, helping to prevent disease. Nests in temperate regions last only for a single season and do not survive the winter.|$|E

50|$|<b>Honeybees</b> are {{challenged}} to balance energy consumption and replenishment in {{their pursuit of}} nectar. High thoracic temperatures required for foraging flight pose a thermoregulatory imbalance that <b>honeybees</b> attempt to alleviate by targeting particular viscosities and temperatures of nectar resources. In lower environmental temperatures where energy loss is more pronounced, it has been shown through Apis mellifera scutellata that <b>honeybees</b> seek warmer, less-concentrated and less-viscous nectar, an energetically favorable behavior.|$|R
5|$|With that said, honeybees perform {{some level}} of {{pollination}} of nearly 75% of all plant species directly used for human food worldwide. Catastrophic loss of honeybees could have significant impact, therefore; {{it is estimated that}} seven out of the 60 major agricultural crops in North American economy would be lost, and this is only for one region of the world. Farms that have intensive systems (high density of crops) will be impacted the most compared to non-intensive systems (small local gardens that depend on wild bees) because of dependence on honeybees. These types of farms have a high demand for <b>honeybee</b> pollination services, which in the U.S. alone costs $1.25 billion annually. This cost is offset, however, as honeybees as pollinators generate 22.8 to 57 billion Euros globally.|$|E
5|$|A 1998 {{study in}} Bundjalung National Park in {{northern}} New South Wales found that B.aemula inflorescences are foraged {{by a variety}} of small mammals, including marsupials such as yellow-footed antechinus (Antechinus flavipes), and rodents such as pale field rat (Rattus tunneyi), Australian swamp rat (R. lutreolus) and grassland melomys (Melomys burtoni) and even the house mouse (Mus musculus). These animals carry pollen loads comparable to those of nectarivorous birds, making them effective pollinators. Grey-headed flying foxes (Pteropus poliocephalus) were also observed visiting B.aemula and their heads and bellies were noted to contact stigmas while feeding. Bird species that have been observed feeding at the flowers of B.aemula include rainbow lorikeet and scarlet and Lewin's honeyeaters. Several other honeyeaters were recorded on B.aemula inflorescences for The Banksia Atlas, including the New Holland, brown, white-cheeked, and tawny-crowned honeyeaters, noisy miner, little wattlebird and noisy friarbird. The Bundjalung field study found the brown honeyeater carried much higher loads of B.aemula pollen than other species measured, which included white-cheeked and yellow-faced honeyeaters and silvereyes. Insects such as ants and bees (including the introduced <b>honeybee)</b> have also been recorded.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters {{consume a}} wide range of insects; beyond a few distasteful {{butterflies}} they consume almost any insect from tiny Drosophila flies to large beetles and dragonflies. At some point bee-eaters have been recorded eating beetles, mayflies, stoneflies, cicadas, termites, crickets and grasshoppers, mantises, true flies and moths. For many species the dominant prey item are stinging members of the order Hymenoptera, namely wasps and bees. In a survey of 20 studies the proportion of the diet made up by bees and wasps varied from 20% to 96%, with the average being 70%. Of these honeybees can comprise {{a large part of the}} diet, as much as 89% of the overall intake. The preference for bees and wasps may have arisen because of the numerical abundance of these suitably sized insects. The giant <b>honeybee</b> is a particularly commonly eaten species. These bees attempt to congregate in a mass defence against the bee-eaters. In Israel, a European bee-eater was documented attempting to eat a small bat that it had caught, which probably couldn't fit down its throat.|$|E

50|$|Because they forage at {{the same}} sites, B. hortorum compete largely with <b>honeybees.</b> To resolve the issue and {{maximize}} their consumption during foraging, bumblebees forage {{early in the morning}} and evening while <b>honeybees</b> forage during the afternoon.|$|R
5|$|Four {{species of}} bird have been {{observed}} visiting the flowers of B.telmatiaea: the red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), silvereye (Zosterops lateralis), New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae) and the brown honeyeater (Lichmera indistincta). The introduced European <b>honeybee</b> (Apis mellifera) is also commonly observed, and visits by ants and Hylaeus plasterer bees have been recorded. Visits by nectarivorous mammals have not been directly observed, but their involvement in pollination is certain, as their scats have often been found on inflorescences, and studies of other Banksia species have consistently demonstrated their involvement. Moreover, a number of characteristics of the B.telmatiaea spike are purported to be adaptations to pollination by nocturnal mammals: the strong, musky odour, the occurrence of inflorescences hidden within the foliage close to the ground, the large amounts of nectar produced, and the pattern of nectar production, which peaks at dawn and dusk. This last adaptation is thought to favour visits by birds and mammals, which feed {{in the morning and}} evening respectively, as opposed to insects, which are most active during the day.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} spring, the queen {{comes out of}} {{diapause}} and finds a suitable place to create her colony. Then she builds wax cells in which to lay her eggs which were fertilised the previous year. The eggs that hatch develop into female workers, and in time, the queen populates the colony, with workers feeding the young and performing other duties similar to <b>honeybee</b> workers. In temperate zones, young queens (gynes) leave the nest in the autumn and mate, often more than once, with males (drones) that are forcibly driven out of the colony. The drones and workers die as the weather turns colder; the young queens feed intensively to build up stores of fat for the winter. They survive in a resting state (diapause), generally below ground, until the weather warms up in the spring with the early bumblebee being the species that is {{among the first to}} emerge. Many species of bumblebee follow this general trend within the year. Bombus pensylvanicus is a species that follows this type of colony cycle. For this species the cycle begins in February, reproduction starts in July or August, and ends in the winter months. The queen remains in hibernation until spring of the following year in order to optimize conditions to search for a nest.|$|E

Here we examine the impacts of <b>honeybees</b> and the bumblebee, Bombus terrestris, on native flower-visiting insects in Tasmania. To assess whether native insects have lower abundance or are excluded in areas that have been colonised by exotic bees, we quantified the abundance, diversity and floral preferences of flower-visiting insects at sites where bumblebees and <b>honeybees</b> were present, and compared them to sites where they were absent.
