5|$|In November 2013, a free {{mobile app}} {{entitled}} The Everyday Heroes of Postman’s Park was launched. The app provides detailed accounts {{of each of}} the fifty-four incidents recorded on the Memorial and reveals the lives of the sixty-two people commemorated. The app employs <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> technology and the built-in camera on the device to scan each tablet and then deliver the relevant information about the person. The app is the result of collaboration between Prossimo Ventures Ltd and Dr John Price of the University of Roehampton, supported by Creativeworks London, a Knowledge Exchange Hub for the Creative Economy funded by the Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC). The app can be used on a range of devices including iPhone, iPad and Android devices.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis was {{the first}} {{original}} video game developed by Square Enix exclusively for mobile phones, originally released on NTT DoCoMo's FOMA mobile devices, and the first action role-playing game exclusive to the platform. The company's first major mobile title, also in collaboration with NTT DoCoMo, was a remake of the original Final Fantasy. Using {{lessons learned from the}} development of the Final Fantasy port, the team worked hard to make Before Crisis a uniquely mobile experience, with gameplay features built to exploit mobile functions such as the camera and network capacity. The camera function used to generate Materia was based on a simple <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> that specifies the Materia generated based on the picture's general color. One of the challenges during development was to keep the framerate smooth during moments of high action, especially as no two mobiles would have identical components. In addition to these problems were issues with integrating the multiplayer functions, balancing the gameplay for different playstyles, creating a comfortable button layout, and adjusting the amount of content they could include for mobiles while maintaining the desired product quality.|$|E

40|$|<b>Image</b> Pattern <b>Recognition</b> {{attempts}} to infer {{properties of the}} world from image data. Such capabilities are crucial for making measurements from satellite or telescope images related to Earth and space science problems.

At present, the field of <b>image</b> pattern <b>recognition</b> lacks a unified scientific structure for developing and evaluating <b>image</b> pattern <b>recognition</b> applications. The overall goal of this project is to begin developing such a structure. This report summarizes results of a 3 -year research effort in <b>image</b> pattern <b>recognition</b> addressing the following three principal aims: (1) to create a software foundation for the research and identify <b>image</b> pattern <b>recognition</b> problems in Earth and space science; (2) to develop image measurement operations based on Artificial Visual Systems; and (3) to develop multiscale image descriptions for use in interactive image analysis...|$|R

He wrote that iMessage is [...] "becoming a platform all its own", and although he liked that extensions mean access to information from apps without needing to open the respective apps, he wrote that new iMessage interface is difficult to understand and that the use of [...] "third-party apps, stickers, crazy confetti effects, and emoji all over the place" [...] is a [...] "nightmare", although finishing with [...] "Or maybe that's a wonderland, not a nightmare. Your call." [...] Regarding third-party support in Siri, he called it [...] "great", while noting the limited class of apps ("calls, messaging, payments, photos, ride-sharing apps, some CarPlay systems, and workouts"), and that sometimes a button press was required to complete the process. Beyond app integrations, he criticized Siri, writing [...] "Siri doesn't seem to have gotten a whole lot smarter than you remember". Bohn enjoyed the new machine learning technology present in the Photos app, writing that he was [...] "impressed" [...] by Apple's <b>image</b> <b>recognition</b> technology, which he noted is done locally on the device, but did criticize the error rate, where he compares the technology to Google Photos as a step ahead. Bohn liked the new designs for the Music and Maps apps, saying both the redesigns were [...] "for the better". Bohn particularly enjoyed the new lock screen, where he highlighted that notification bubbles can be 3D Touch-ed to access more information, all without needing to unlock the phone. Other small bits of new features he liked included [...] "deletable" [...] apps, upgraded [...] "widgets" [...] when 3D Touch-ing a home screen icon, and breaking news notifications in Apple News. Overall, Bohn referred to iOS 10 as [...] "Still a walled garden, but with more doors".|$|E
