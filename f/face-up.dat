5|$|The {{huge number}} of clipped coins in the Hoxne Hoard has made it {{possible}} for archaeologists to observe the process of coin-clipping in detail. The coins were evidently cut <b>face-up</b> to avoid damaging the portrait. The average level of clipping is roughly the same for coins dating from 350 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Chest x-ray is {{the initial}} imaging {{technique}} used to diagnose TBI. The film {{may not have}} any signs in an otherwise asymptomatic patient. Indications of TBI seen on radiographs include deformity in the trachea or a defect in the tracheal wall. Radiography may also show cervical emphysema, air in the tissues of the neck. X-rays may also show accompanying injuries and signs such as fractures and subcutaneous emphysema. If subcutaneous emphysema occurs and the hyoid bone appears in an X-ray to be sitting unusually high in the throat, {{it may be an}} indication that the trachea has been severed. TBI is also suspected if an endotracheal tube appears in an X-ray to be out of place, or if its cuff appears to be more full than normal or to protrude through a tear in the airway. If a bronchus is torn all the way around, the lung may collapse outward toward the chest wall (rather than inward, as it usually does in pneumothorax) because it loses the attachment to the bronchus which normally holds it toward the center. In a person lying <b>face-up,</b> the lung collapses toward the diaphragm and the back. This sign, described in 1969, is called fallen lung sign and is pathognomonic of TBI (that is, it is diagnostic for TBI because it does not occur in other conditions); however it occurs only rarely. In as many as one in five cases, people with blunt trauma and TBI have no signs of the injury on chest X-ray. CT scanning detects over 90% of TBI resulting from blunt trauma, but neither X-ray nor CT are a replacement for bronchoscopy.|$|E
25|$|<b>Face-up</b> deal: In this variant, {{the dealer}} can lay out {{up to four}} cards per player face up {{as long as the}} same number is {{revealed}} for each player. Revealing the cards can also set up the psychological warfare of bidding and later playing, referred to as power checks, but <b>face-up</b> deals are sometimes done by dealers who set the deck to determine if the cut has disrupted their preparations. When a <b>face-up</b> deal is made, Blind Nil can still be bid if the player has not viewed any face-down cards.|$|E
25|$|A {{continuing}} effect which activates {{when the}} monster is played <b>face-up</b> and continues until the monster is destroyed or tributed.|$|E
25|$|An {{effect that}} {{activates}} when a face-down monster is flipped <b>face-up,</b> either from changing battle position, being targeted by an attack, {{or from a}} card effect.|$|E
25|$|Exile: Cards {{that have}} been exiled by {{specific}} effects are put here. Unless a card says otherwise, cards in this zone are <b>face-up.</b> Comparatively few cards and abilities affect cards in the exile zone.|$|E
25|$|In 1945–46, {{his next}} {{exposure}} to numismatics was a friend’s home {{in which a}} dozen or more Indian cents were embedded <b>face-up</b> in a concrete walk near the front door. In 1948, his family moved to Forty Fort, Pennsylvania (about an hour away from Honesdale).|$|E
25|$|After the pre-flop betting round, {{assuming}} {{there remain}} {{at least two}} players {{taking part in the}} hand, the dealer deals a flop, three <b>face-up</b> community cards. The flop is followed by a second betting round. This and all subsequent betting rounds begin with the player to the dealer's left and continue clockwise.|$|E
25|$|When Palatine {{police found}} the bodies, {{it was more}} than 5½ hours after the 9 p.m. closing. Michael Castro's parents called the police a couple hours after closing time. Later, Guadalupe Maldonado's wife called police, {{concerned}} that her husband had not returned home from work and that his car was still in the apparently closed Brown's Chicken parking lot. When officers arrived at the building, they spotted the rear employees' door open. Inside, they found the seven bodies, some face-down, some <b>face-up,</b> in a cooler and in a walk-in refrigerator.|$|E
25|$|Electronic {{paper was}} first {{developed}} in the 1970s by Nick Sheridon at Xerox's Palo Alto Research Center. The first electronic paper, called Gyricon, consisted of polyethylene spheres between 75 and 106 micrometers across. Each sphere is a janus particle composed of negatively charged black plastic {{on one side and}} positively charged white plastic on the other (each bead is thus a dipole). The spheres are embedded in a transparent silicone sheet, with each sphere suspended in a bubble of oil so that they can rotate freely. The polarity of the voltage applied to each pair of electrodes then determines whether the white or black side is <b>face-up,</b> thus giving the pixel a white or black appearance.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, the {{insurance}} bet {{is susceptible to}} advantage play. It is advantageous to make an insurance bet whenever the hole card {{has more than a}} chance of one in three of being a ten. Advantage play techniques can sometimes identify such situations. In a multi-hand, <b>face-up,</b> single deck game, it is possible to establish whether insurance is a good bet simply by observing the other cards on the table after the deal; even if there are just 2 player hands exposed, and neither of their two initial cards is a ten, then 16 in 47 of the remaining cards are tens, which is larger than 1 in 3, so insurance is a good bet. This is an elementary example of the family of advantage play techniques known as card counting.|$|E
25|$|During the Battle Phase of each turn, {{the player}} {{may choose to}} attack their {{opponent}} once with each monster in Attack Position (<b>face-up</b> in a vertical orientation), targeting one of the opponent's monsters or, if the opponent has no defending monsters, attacking them directly. When an attack is declared, the ATK points of the attacking monster is compared with the ATK or DEF points of the defending monster, depending on which position it is in. If both the attacking and defending monsters are in Attack Position, then the monster with the lowest ATK points is destroyed {{and sent to the}} Graveyard, with its owner losing Life Points based on {{the difference between the two}} monsters' ATK points. For example, if a monster with 1400 ATK destroys a monster with 1000 ATK, the owner of the losing monster will lose 400 Life Points. If both monsters have the same number of ATK Points, both monsters are destroyed and neither player takes damage. Monsters with 0 ATK cannot destroy anything, that is to say, if two monsters with 0 ATK battle, neither monster will be destroyed.|$|E
500|$|The train travels out of {{the station}} and up the [...] lift hill. The train then drops, {{reaching}} a top speed of [...] before entering an overbanked turn. This is followed by a zero-g roll and [...] "Fly-to-Lie" [...] element that turns riders from a face-down prone position to a <b>face-up</b> lying position. It then goes through a small tunnel and enters the vertical loop. Riders are then transitioned back to a prone position after entering the following [...] "Lie-to-Fly" [...] element, which travels over water. Riders then experience a double inline twist element, and a helix that turns to the left. The train enters the final brake run and follows a short path back to the station.|$|E
500|$|The visual {{opens with}} Suzuki's name, {{and the title}} [...] "Free Free", {{superimposed}} on several LED lights. It follows with the singer standing in the room, but only dim-lit to show her figure {{in front of the}} lights. The first verse has the singer laying down on a large platform, covering a screen of LED lights, and sings to the camera. She dances and sings the track in the room—taken with long shot and <b>face-up</b> directions—whilst posing next to a couple of TV screens that features Nakata's face. As the chorus plays, the scene with her in the room is digitally manipulated, showcasing several overlapping techniques to show a blurry-like vision. She returns to lying on the ground during the bridge section, and the final chorus has her dancing in the room.|$|E
500|$|Most of the tournaments {{played at}} the WSOP are {{variants}} of Texas hold'em, a game where each player may {{use a combination of}} the five community cards and two hole cards to make the best hand. [...] Another poker variant with community cards is Omaha, [...] in which each player is dealt four hole cards and must use two of them in conjunction with three of the five community cards to make the best possible five-card hand. [...] In contrast to games with community cards, some variants, such as stud or draw, deal each player separate hands with no common cards. [...] Seven-card stud deals each player two hole cards, followed by four <b>face-up</b> cards one at a time, and then another hidden card, with betting after each round. Other games {{played at the}} 2007 tournament included Razz, H.O.R.S.E., and Deuce-to-Seven. [...] Prior to 2000, seven-card stud was the most common game in U.S. casinos, but today hold'em has almost totally eclipsed the once popular game.|$|E
500|$|Hummer was a [...] back to {{the basket}} player who {{generally}} defended opposing high school centers. He had an underdeveloped <b>face-up</b> game yet he was undersized to play that style of game in power conferences. Power conference schools questioned how much potential he had in a league where his low post skills would likely be defended by larger, stronger and/or more athletic players who relegated him to perimeter play. When Princeton head coach Sydney Johnson recruited him, the only competition was mid-major schools and Hummer {{was not interested in}} any of them. During his campus visit with his father at his brother Alex's (Princeton Class of 2011) dorm room, he decided at midnight to go hang out at Dan Mavraides room across campus, signalling to his father that he was pretty comfortable with Princeton and likely to attend. Due to Hummer's relationship with former Princeton and current Georgetown Hoyas men's basketball head coach John Thompson III, he was able to train at the Georgetown University gym over the summers. He also played in the Kenner League (the only National Collegiate Athletic Association–sanctioned summer league in the Washington, D.C.) during the summer.|$|E
2500|$|Example: If {{the player}} has [...] "Stargazer Magician" [...] (Scale 1) and [...] "Timegazer Magician" [...] (Scale 8) in their Pendulum Zones, they can Pendulum Summon {{multiple}} monsters from their hand and/or <b>face-up</b> Pendulum Monsters from the Extra Deck with levels ranging from 2 to 7.|$|E
2500|$|Introduced {{with the}} Yu-Gi-Oh! Arc-V anime series. Pendulum Monsters are {{variations}} of the above monster types, represented by a green gradient over each type's respective color (for example, Effect Pendulum Monsters are orange/green while Xyz Pendulum Monsters are black/green). They are stored and summoned {{in the same manner}} as their original counterparts, but are sent to the Extra Deck <b>face-up</b> when they would be sent from the field to the Graveyard (monsters sent from the Hand or Deck will still go to the Graveyard). During the Main Phase, players can place any Pendulum Monsters in their hand into any open Pendulum Zones, where they become treated as spell cards and can utilise a Pendulum Effect listed separately from any Monster Effects (some Pendulum cards may not necessarily possess a Pendulum Effect). Pendulum Monsters possess indicators known as [...] "Scales", which are used to perform a Pendulum Summon. Once during a player's turn, if there are Pendulum Monsters with different Scales in both Pendulum Zones, the player may Special Summon multiple monsters from their hand, as well as any Pendulum Monsters <b>face-up</b> in the Extra Deck, whose levels are in between the two different Scale values. Pendulum Monsters that are stored in the Extra Deck face down must first be summoned using their respective summoning methods and can only be Pendulum Summoned when they are <b>face-up</b> in the Extra Deck (for example, an [...] "Xyz Pendulum" [...] Monster must first be Xyz Summoned before it can be Pendulum Summoned).|$|E
2500|$|With bidding, {{the player}} winning the bid {{declares}} trump, then lays all meld <b>face-up</b> on the table. The other player shows {{her or his}} melds as well. Meld points are tallied, and players return meld cards to their hands. Some varieties accept a [...] "round house", kings and queens of each suit, and earn a bonus 10 points awarding a total of 250 points.|$|E
2500|$|When an attacking monster targets {{a monster}} in Defense Position (horizontal orientation), then the attacking monster's ATK points will be {{compared}} with the defending monster's DEF points. If the attacking monster has more ATK points than the defending monster's DEF points, the defending monster is destroyed, but its owner will not receive any damage to their Life Points (unless the attacking monster possesses a [...] "Piercing Damage" [...] effect, in which case the defending player takes damage based on {{the difference between the two}} values). On the other hand, if the player attacks a defending monster whose DEF points are greater than their attacking monster's ATK points, neither monster is destroyed but the attacking player will take damage based on the difference between the two values. For example, if a monster with 1000 ATK attacks a defending monster with 1400 DEF, the attacking player will lose 400 Life Points. If the attacking monster's ATK points and the defending monster's DEF points are the same, neither monster is destroyed and neither player takes damage. If a monster in face-down Defense Position is targeted for an attack, it is automatically Flip Summoned into <b>face-up</b> Defense Position. The card will then remain <b>face-up</b> until it is either destroyed or tributed, or allowed to be flipped face-down again by a card effect.|$|E
2500|$|Deficient Hand: Sometimes a misdeal is {{also called}} {{if a player}} is dealt a [...] "deficient" [...] hand, such as one that {{contains}} one or no Spades or no face cards (players should agree beforehand on what constitutes a [...] "deficient hand"). A player wishing to declare a misdeal due to a deficient hand must throw down his hand <b>face-up,</b> so other players may verify, and declare [...] "misdeal" [...] before he or his team has bid. Declaring a misdeal on a deficient hand is optional; a player may try to bid [...] "nil" [...] if dealt such a hand.|$|E
2500|$|Flop: Alice now burns a {{card and}} deals the flop of three <b>face-up</b> {{community}} cards, [...] On this round, as on all subsequent rounds, the {{player on the}} dealer's left begins the betting. Bob checks, Carol opens for $2, and Alice raises another $2 (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol and $2 to raise), making the total bet now facing Bob $4. Bob calls (puts in $4, $2 to match Carol's initial bet and $2 to match Alice's raise). Carol calls as well, putting in $2. The pot now contains $18, $6 from the last round and $12 from three players this round.|$|E
2500|$|Gerald Earl Cavanaugh, a Canadian-American immigrant, is {{believed}} to be the Doodler's first victim. He was forty-nine at the time of his murder, which had occurred by stabbing. Cavanaugh's fully clothed body was located on January 24, 1974, lying <b>face-up</b> on Ocean Beach in San Francisco, California, in the early hours of the morning. He had died hours before. He was determined to have been conscious at the time he was killed and had attempted to resist his killer, as he had self-defense wounds noted. He initially remained unidentified, being temporarily known as [...] "John Doe #7" [...] by the medical examiner. He was a single man with few details about his personal life.|$|E
2500|$|The size of {{a diamond}} {{may also be a}} factor. Very small (< 0.02 carats [...] ) diamonds—known as melée—are usually given {{simplified}} cuts (i.e., with fewer facets). This is because a full-cut brilliant of such small size would appear milky to the human eye, owing to its inability to resolve the stone's dispersive fire. Conversely, very large diamonds are usually given fancy cuts with many extra facets. Conventional round brilliant or fancy cuts do not scale up satisfactorily, so the extra facets are needed to ensure there are no [...] "dead spots". Because large diamonds {{are less likely to be}} set in jewelry, their cuts are considered for how well they display the diamonds' properties from a wide range of viewing directions; in the case of more moderate-sized diamonds, the cuts are considered primarily for their <b>face-up</b> appeal.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} morning of [...] December 27, 1985, Fossey was {{discovered}} murdered in the bedroom of her cabin located at {{the far edge of}} the camp in the Virunga Mountains, Rwanda. Her body was found <b>face-up</b> near the two beds where she slept, roughly [...] away from a hole that her assailant(s) had apparently cut in the wall of the cabin. Wayne Richard McGuire, Fossey's last research assistant at Karisoke, was summoned to the scene by Fossey's house servant and found her bludgeoned to death, reporting that [...] "when I reached down to check her vital signs, I saw her face had been split, diagonally, with one machete blow." [...] The cabin was littered with broken glass and overturned furniture, with a 9-mm handgun and ammunition beside her on the floor. Robbery was not believed to be the motive for the crime, as Fossey's valuables were still in the cabin, including her passport, handguns, and thousands of dollars in U.S. bills and traveler's checks.|$|E
2500|$|Bidding {{begins at}} 300, or {{as little as}} 150 for [...] "under-the-gun" [...] bids, and {{increases}} in multiples of 10. The highest bidder wins the auction and turns up the three-card widow for all to see. The three widow cards are placed in the bid winner's hand. The bid winner then declares trump and lays down meld. The other two players also lay meld <b>face-up</b> for count. After the appropriate points have been tallied the bid winner must set aside any three cards {{that have not been}} melded, though if not enough cards remain in the hand they may be taken from melded cards. This will reduce the bid winner's hand to 15 cards. For all three players, meld is now returned to each respective player's hand, and the round is played. During the round, a player must take at least one trick to [...] "save one's meld", even if the trick contains no points; otherwise, no meld points will be counted for that player during that round.|$|E
2500|$|Shannan Maria Gilbert (October 24, 1986 – May 1, 2010) was {{an escort}} {{who may have}} been a victim of the Long Island serial killer. She left for a client's {{residence}} in Oak Beach after midnight on May 1, 2010. At 4:51 in the morning, 911 dispatchers received a panicked phone call from Gilbert who can be heard saying that there was someone [...] "after her" [...] and that [...] "they" [...] were trying to kill her. She was last seen a short time later banging on the front door of a nearby Oak Beach residence and screaming for help before running off into the night. After nineteen months of searching, police found Gilbert's remains in a marsh, half a mile away from where she was last seen. In May 2012, the Suffolk County medical examiners ruled that Shannan drowned while she ran through the marsh in a drug induced panic, ruling her death as [...] "death by misadventure" [...] or [...] "inconclusive." [...] Her family believes she was murdered. On November 15, 2012 a lawsuit was filed by Mari Gilbert (Shannan's mother) against the Suffolk County Police Department in the hopes of getting more answers about what happened to her daughter the night she went missing. Due to controversy surrounding the cause of Gilbert's death, in September 2014, famed forensic pathologist Dr. Michael Baden agreed to conduct an independent autopsy of Shannan Gilbert's remains in hopes of determining a clear cause of death. Upon examination of Gilbert's remains, Baden found damage to her Hyoid bone, suggesting that strangulation may have occurred. Baden also noted that her body was found <b>face-up,</b> which is not common for drowning victims. Despite this, her death is still officially listed as an accident. On July 23, 2016, Gilbert's mother, Mari Gilbert, was murdered in her home in Ellenville, New York. Later that day, Shannan's younger sister, Sarra Elizabeth Gilbert, {{was arrested and charged with}} the murder of her mother.|$|E
50|$|Players {{can play}} any card from their hand, {{or any of}} their <b>face-up</b> cards. If a <b>face-up</b> card is played that had covered a face-down card, the face-down card is flipped over and becomes a <b>face-up</b> card, and becomes {{eligible}} for play on the next trick.|$|E
5000|$|If the two cards played are {{of equal}} value, {{then there is}} a [...] "war". Both players place the next card of their pile face down, {{depending}} on the variant, and then another card <b>face-up.</b> The owner of the higher <b>face-up</b> card wins the war and adds all four (or six) cards on the table to the bottom of their deck. If the <b>face-up</b> cards are again equal then the battle repeats with another set of face-down/up cards. This repeats until one player's <b>face-up</b> card is higher than their opponent's.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>face-up</b> card {{be found}} in the stock after discarding, both players have a right to see it. The <b>face-up</b> card must be thrown aside, and the next card given instead.|$|E
5000|$|Five-card stud: Each {{player is}} dealt two face-down cards and three <b>face-up</b> cards. Some {{versions}} of this game may require players to compulsorily select any one face-down cards and any two <b>face-up</b> cards to make a three-card hand.|$|E
5000|$|Renew one of {{the hands}} on the table. (If they renew {{a hand on the}} table, they have the choice to place it <b>face-up</b> or face-down. If they choose <b>face-up,</b> their turn is over; if they choose face-down their turn continues.) ...|$|E
50|$|A player {{may only}} capture with a <b>face-up</b> piece {{of their own}} color, and may only capture a <b>face-up</b> piece of the {{opposing}} color. In all captures, the captured piece {{is removed from the}} board and its square is occupied by the capturing piece.|$|E
50|$|After the auction, if {{the dummy}} was dealt 15 cards the declarer may discard two cards from the dummy's {{hand and the}} dummy's hand is turned <b>face-up.</b> If playing with 13 cards in the dummy's hand, their hand is turned <b>face-up</b> without {{discarding}} any cards.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{is played}} by two players, 1-on-1 (heads-up), who are dealt five {{alternate}} <b>face-up</b> cards each, lined up in a row. In turn, each player draws a card from the deck and places it <b>face-up</b> {{on one of the}} five cards that they have, building a column or a hand. In each round, players must place one card on each of their columns before continuing to build the other columns: the columns must be equal in each round. The fourth card in each hand is played face-down, and the fifth card <b>face-up.</b> Four of the five cards in each hand are <b>face-up,</b> so both players are privy to their opponent’s hands. Eventually, each player will have five hands of five cards, each.|$|E
50|$|Minor {{aspects of}} the {{presentation}} are adjustable, for example the cards can be dealt either <b>face-up</b> or face-down. If they are dealt face-down then the spectator must look through each of the piles until finding which one contains the selected card, whereas if they are dealt <b>face-up</b> then an attentive spectator can immediately {{answer the question of}} which pile contains the selected card. Some performers deal the cards into <b>face-up</b> rows or columns instead of piles, which saves more time as all cards are partly visible.|$|E
