5|$|A plug-in hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> (PHEV or PHV), {{also known}} as a plug-in hybrid, is a hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> with {{rechargeable}} batteries that can be restored to full charge by connecting a plug to an external electric power source. A plug-in hybrid shares the characteristics of both a conventional hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicle</b> and an all-electric vehicle: it uses a gasoline engine and an electric motor for propulsion, but a PHEV has a larger battery pack that can be recharged, allowing operation in all-electric mode until the battery is depleted.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> {{has been}} seen by many nations as an {{effective}} measure to reduce toxic emissions in urban areas and reduce nation-wide carbon footprint. Uptake of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> in different markets is different. There are many factors which can influence deployment of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Government policies {{are the key to}} deployment of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Particularly, <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> require specific charge infrastructure to support their operation. China has considered deployment of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> as a key instrument to solve air pollution issues in urban areas. The Chinese national government and local authorities apply a number of policies and deploy various infrastructures to enable operation of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles.</b> However, there is a different attitude toward to <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> from the Brazilian public authorities. Lack of support of government policies and infrastructure has resulted in slow deployment in Brazil. This paper studies some best practices of deployment of infrastructure for <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> and analyses the social and economic context of such policies, their impacts on the market penetration of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> as well as their short and long term benefits.

40|$|Abstract — The {{need for}} a {{bidirectional}} DC/DC converter in <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> is studied. Here, a universal power electronic interface {{that can be used}} in any type of <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (EV), hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (HEV) and plug-in hybrid <b>electric</b> <b>vehicles</b> (PHEV) is discussed. This power electronic converter interfaces the energy storage device of the vehicle with the motor drive and the charging unit. The fully directional converter is capable of working in buck or boost modes in any direction with a non-inverted output voltage. The output of the converter is improved with a feedback control loop. This is verified with MATLAB/SIMULINK (MATLAB version R 2010 a).
