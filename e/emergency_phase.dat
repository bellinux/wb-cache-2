The military operation, known as Operation Lama, was to last {{for the duration of}} the <b>emergency</b> <b>phase</b> in the immediate aftermath. An initial deployment of 120soldiers and 40vehicles arrived on September25 from the Canadian Forces Base Gagetown in Oromocto, New Brunswick arrived in Newfoundland. Three ships and a fleet of helicopters were called in for the distribution of emergency aid and the military set up temporary bridges while long-term plans for reconstruction were made. Operation Lama also enabled partial repairs of several buildings, and simultaneously, emergency personnel surveyed roughly 500mi (900km) of roads in Newfoundland. On September27, government officials stated that it would take months for cleanup efforts to finish. Ten days after the storm, six towns were still isolated as progress on temporary road reconstruction was being made only slowly. Allocation of military aid continued through October6, though the number of on-scene personnel began to decrease two days earlier.|$|E

500|$|Supply {{distribution}} centers {{were established}} in Ormoc, providing residents with food, water, and materials, by November11. People were given a can of sardines and 1kg (2.2lb) of rice at these centers. These centers were only able to operate in daylight though {{due to a lack}} of fuel and transportation. Water was supplied in limited quantities from Cebu. Medical and sanitation teams were deployed throughout the province, with many coming from surrounding areas. Residents searched through debris for lumber to construct makeshift coffins while others stacked bodies to be picked up by wheelbarrows or trucks. Officials had difficulty determining how to best deal with mass casualties as bodies lay across the Ormoc region. Many were found in the coastal barangays of Linao, Camp Downes, and Bantigue as well as the Ormoc pier. In order to prevent the spread of disease, mass graves were dug, with 700bodies buried on November8. Dump trucks were used to transport the dead to these sites as quickly as possible. As decomposition set in, residents stated that [...] " [...] putrid smell was unbearable." [...] Even months after the storm, bodies were occasionally discovered, some found in drainage systems. By November10, four navy vessels were searching debris in the waters near Ormoc for bodies; 16 were recovered that day with more believed to be submerged in the bay. Roads surrounding the city were finally cleared by November12; however, electricity remained out. With the deployment of medical teams from Japan, hospitals in the region returned to full capacity. By November22, electricity and water had been 70percent and 60percent restored, respectively. The <b>emergency</b> <b>phase</b> of assistance ended on November29 and coordination of disaster relief was returned to the Philippines. By that time, national aid to Ormoc reached $1.1million, with more than half coming from a presidential grant.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} three {{questions}} are addressed concerning possible differences and their implications for planning between natural and technological disasters. First, are disaster for planning purposes best approached generically or in agent specific terms? The mostly research based {{answer is that}} the generic approach is more valid although this does not mean there are no meaningful differences along other dimensions between disasters. Thus, second, we ask along what lines disasters might be usefully differentiated or typologized? Eight key dimensions are discussed, mostly as they are significant for the <b>emergency</b> time <b>phases</b> of disaster occasions. Third, we conclude with asking whether whatever distinction are made, are they equally applicable across all phases of the disaster planning cycle, namely, mitigation or prevention, emergency preparedness, emergency response, and recovery? Our belief discussion takes the position that it appears the generic approach is clearly best applicable to the <b>emergency</b> times <b>phases,</b> somewhat less so for the mitigation phase with recovery falling in somewhat between the others. In the process of answering all three questions, implications for institutional and organizational behavior will be noted...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe Italian vessel Costa Concordia wrecked on January 13 th 2012 {{offshore}} the Giglio Island (Tuscany, Italy), {{with the}} loss of 32 lives. Salvage operation of the vessel started immediately after the wreck. This operation was the largest and most expensive maritime salvage ever attempted on a wrecked ship and it ended in July 2014 when the Costa Concordia was removed from the Giglio Island, and dragged in the port of Genoa where it was dismantled. The refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were monitored, in the period between 14 th and 27 th of July, exploiting SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) images acquired by the X-band COSMO-SkyMed satellite constellation in crisis mode. The main targets of the monitoring system were: (i) the detection of possible spill of pollutant material from the vessel and (ii) to exclude that oil slicks, illegally produced by other vessels, could be improperly linked to the naval convoy during its transit along the route between the Giglio Island and the port of Genoa. Results point out that the adopted monitoring system, through the use of the COSMO-SkyMed constellation, can be profitably employed to monitor <b>emergency</b> <b>phases</b> related to single ship or naval convoy over wide areas and with a suitable temporal coverage. Furthermore, the refloating and removal phases of the Costa Concordia were a success because no pollution was produced during the operations...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} present their field {{experiences}} as volunteers {{of the association}} “Psicologi per i Popoli − Trentino” {{in the aftermath of}} the 24 th August 2016 earthquake, which struck especially Amatrice and the neighbouring municipalities. From those experiences, the whish emerged to share an “operational model” concerning the psychologist’s role when collaborating with the technical team responsible for habitability assessment (engineers, architects, surveyors and fire fighters), and helping people to collect their personal belongings from their houses. Hence the need arises to promote an approach towards the integration of the various professional roles which preserves their specificity. A reflective approach would represent a collaborative way of working, a different intervention perspective, and would allow a constructive self-positioning in the situation and context in which everyone operates. Through some reports from the field experience, both with people and technical teams, this paper will underline the importance of an integrated work among professionals involved in the emergency situations with different roles. Some reflections for the future will be provided, particularly about the prevention of burn-out and the training of the technical teams involved in the maxi-emergency context. Thanks to this “operational model”, the inclusion of psychologists in multidisciplinary teams will help in keeping the focus on the fundamental elements of well-being for all the people involved in the different <b>emergency</b> <b>phases...</b>|$|R
40|$|Risks {{affecting}} coasts can be {{aggravated by}} climate change. Having adequate response mechanisms requires an integrated, multi-risk planning system, which should include from prevention to <b>emergency</b> <b>phases</b> of risk management, {{together with a}} wide range of authorities. This research aims at analyzing the social dimension of coastal risk management at two different levels – analysis of risk governance and of local risk perception -; introducing quantitative methods as the main tool of analysis. The approach of the research combines: (a) network analysis to draw relationships between competent stakeholders and plans, in prevention and in <b>emergency</b> <b>phases,</b> as well as to evaluate the level of integration of climate change into the current planning system; and (b) statistical analysis of a survey applied to key stakeholders to analyze the social perception at the local level. The use of unipartite graph models is introduced as a methodological innovation to visualize and analyze heterogeneous data. Quantitative methods are complemented by qualitative techniques such as planning analysis, secondary-documents review and semi-structured interviews to key stakeholders. Results from network analysis show the complexity of the legal and administrative framework of the Catalan coastal risk planning, which partly reflects the diversity of causes, origins, temporal and spatial scales characterizing hazards and risks. On the other hand, a dissimilar management tradition depending on each type of risk is observed. Flood risk management is coordinated by local and regional administration institutions with a more multi-risk perspective but unfortunately, they are not responsible for coastal erosion, a significant component of the global coastal risk in the Catalan littoral, which is managed from a higher administrative level. In turn, climate change is not present in the emergency phase: it is only explicitly considered in the Spanish Coastal Law and the Strategic Environmental Assessment. Concerning local perception, outcomes from the survey applied in two study areas (Maresme and Alt Empordà) reveal the impact of the geographic context to risk perception and to the priorization of quotidian concerns. The cohabitation for decades with natural hazards in coastal areas (especially in the case of Maresme) has led the population to acquire knowledge about the origin of these problems quite in line with scientific research. In contrast, confidence towards responsible stakeholders and management tools do not present differences according to the area. Scientists arise as the most trustworthy institution, and planning and coordination are the most prioritized management strategy. It is believed that answers from this part respond to ideological criteria more than geographical context, though further research would be required to confirm this assumption. In a few words, we argue that an overall planning system that guarantees integration amongst administrative levels and sectorial policies is required to increase overall coastal safety. In addition, public perception is a core issue in risk decisions, thus its inclusion into the design of risk planning is essential to achieve an integrated strategic coastal risk management...|$|R
