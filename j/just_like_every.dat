A minor scuffle ensues between Dita and Chi, before Zima restrains Dita, wishing to see the outcome of Hideki's decision and ultimately too falling under Chi's influence. Hideki confirms his love for Chi, only to find that Freya has taken control of her body. Learning that he that he can never engage in sexual intercourse with Chi without rebooting her systems, erasing everything that makes her a unique individual, Hideki states that he will love Chi regardless. Freya confirms that while Chi and herself are indeed the legendary Chobits, they possess neither sentience nor emotions, but rely on software programs <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>every</b> persocom. Again, Hideki stands by his love for Chi. Hideki declines her offer to tell him about Chi's special ability, and Freya vanishes after imploring him {{to take care of her}} sister. Chi awakens, embracing Hideki. The series ends with Chi holding Hideki's hand with visible rings Chi had chosen for the two of them.|$|E

He wrote, [...] "... this should be where the very serious folks at Philip Morris go point by point and explain where Oliver exaggerated and embellished, but they don't.

[...] He noted that Philip Morris does not deny making legal threats to suppress regulations on cigarette packaging and questions how the company: [...] " [...] {{to be taken seriously}} when it readily admits that the products it sells are 'harmful to health'". Furthermore, Morran takes aim at the company's claim that it [...] " [...] and [...] with thousands of regulations worldwide", writing: ... the tobacco industry doesn't support these regulations.

500|$|In the video, Dev {{is seen in}} a club {{scene with}} intense dancing. The main focus is black-painted hands and arms, which are {{prominent}} in several shots of Dev as she is standing naked while the hands are touching her body. Some of the hands were digitally added, {{but the majority of}} them were real, including the ones touching Dev. She explained, [...] "The extras were amazing, they let me paint their hands and bodies, and they stacked {{on top of each other}} and did that for hours. For takes and takes and takes." [...] The video also includes shots of an albino ball python and a tarantula. Cory Lamz of Westword wrote a positive review of the video: [...] "Watching 'In the Dark' is like dancing under a strobe light on ecstasy. In a sea of hands, literally, Dev manages to tease you, seduce you and entice you. She makes you want to touch her, <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>every</b> other hand in the video." [...] Contessa Gayles of AOL Music referred the video to as [...] "freaky" [...] and [...] "funky", writing [...] "Forget 'dancing in the dark,' Dev works it in a sea of dismembered, black-painted hands and arms in this freaky, funky new vid."

[...] Olivia Smith of Daily News noted that in the video, Knowles references Jane Fonda in the movie Barbarella (1968), Tin Woodman and Pamela Anderson through the different costumes she wears. Smith further compared the video with the one for [...] "Single Ladies", writing that Knowles reprises some of the moves as she [...] "can only swivel those hips in so many ways". Brandon Soderberg of Slant Magazine described the introductory part of the video as a David Lynch-like mixture of eroticism and symbolism. He {{wrote that the}} video was [...] "one part Victoria's Secret commercial, another part dream logic anti-narrative, and a CGI-assisted freakout all around". Soderberg commended the video for being [...] "an excess of body and action, not filmic techniques", adding that the dancing in the video [...] "blow our minds anew".|$|E

[...] In some cases, trust can be so severely damaged that repair strategies are fruitless. [...] With each transgression both transgressor and victim assume risks. [...] The transgressor’s efforts at reconciliation may be rejected by the victim, which results in loss of face and potentially an avenue of attack by the victim. [...] If the victim offers forgiveness, there is risk that the transgressor may view the forgiveness as a personality trait that may prompt future transgressions (e.g., “I’ll be forgiven by my partner <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>every</b> other time”).|$|E

[...] "Growing up...I was <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>every</b> other kid. I loved space, stars and dinosaurs. I always knew I wanted to explore.

30|$|<b>Just</b> <b>like</b> in <b>every</b> {{communication}} among entities, {{the reliability of}} information exchange between nanomachines depends {{on the characteristics of}} the communication medium. The ability to integrate the knowledge of the medium characteristics into the design and analysis of the nanomachines is dependent on the appropriateness of the model that is used to mimic the propagation behavior. Popular molecular propagation mechanisms include the use of molecular motors [17 – 19], bacteria [20, 21], and molecular diffusion [22, 23]. The focus of this paper is on the molecular diffusion technique for information exchange among nanomachines. In molecular diffusion technique, information in the form of molecular concentration or type is broadcasted and received by a nanoreceiver, which processes and decodes the information based on predefined biochemical algorithms.|$|R

The toy for Battle Base had three garages that could each hold a single smaller vehicle, and its control bridge seated two. In the series, not only could Battle Base contain all of the smaller vehicles, but even Trailblazer was seen to be able to enter it. The bridge was a rather large full room; <b>just</b> <b>like</b> Trailblazer, <b>every</b> member of the Lightning League can also pilot the Battle Base as well too.|$|R

However, unlike the more centralized kingdoms and city-states to the West, the Ekitis traditionally lived in smaller less politically centralized kingdoms that were largely independent of one another, although they traded together, and the ruling families of the various kingdoms were involved in dynastic marriages. Olomola traced the separation of Ekiti core areas through colonial boundaries fixed between 1894 and 1917 while looking at the balkanization of Ekitiland as part of developments of colonial era and creation of new territories. He observed that boundary of Ekitiland was shifted several times within a spate of 23 years without regard for the existing practice and norms for identifying or creating traditional boundaries in the African traditional society. [...] He noted {{that the use of}} mapping and survey changed the direction of boundary making in Ekitiland like other places where the modern techniques and method of boundary making was introduced.

This affected the working routine with long-time engineer and mixer Greg Reely: [...] "With this new record, ... when we have songs we'd send them to Greg, he would mix and send them back and we'd spend a week listening and be 'well, we like this' and 'we want to change that'."

60|$|I TELL {{these things}} about my boy, {{not so much}} because they were {{peculiar}} to him as because I think they are, many of them, common to all boys. One tiresome fact about boys is that they are so much alike; or used to be. They did not wish to be so, but they could not help it. They did not even know they were alike; and my boy used to suffer in ways that he believed no boy had ever suffered before; but as he grew older he found that boys had been suffering {{in exactly the same way}} from the beginning of time. In the world you will find a great many grown-up boys, with gray beards and grandchildren, who think that they have been different their whole lives through from other people, and are the victims of destiny. That is because with all their growing they have never grown to be men, but have remained a sort of cry-babies. The first thing you have to learn here below is that in essentials you are <b>just</b> <b>like</b> <b>every</b> one else, and that you are different from others only in what is not so much worth while. If you have anything in common with your fellow-creatures, it is something that God gave you; if you have anything that seems quite your own, it is from your silly self, and is a sort of perversion of what came to you from the Creator who made you out of himself, and had nothing else to make any one out of. There is not really any difference between you and your fellow-creatures; but only a seeming difference that flatters and cheats you with a sense of your strangeness, and makes you think you are a remarkable fellow.|$|E
