25|$|The PAM {{sequence}} {{appears to}} be important during spacer insertion in type I-E systems. That sequence contains a strongly conserved final nucleotide (nt) adjacent to the first nt of the protospacer. This nt becomes the final base in the first <b>direct</b> <b>repeat.</b> This suggests that the spacer acquisition machinery generates single-stranded overhangs in the second-to-last position of the <b>direct</b> <b>repeat</b> and in the PAM during spacer insertion. However, not all CRISPR-Cas systems appear to share this mechanism as PAMs in other organisms do not show {{the same level of}} conservation in the final position.

The generation of mul- 2 was attributable to recombination between the pair of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of “TCCC” (Figure  2 b). Mul- 3 and mul- 4 were a triplication and tetraplication of the 18 -bp sequence similar to the duplicated sequence of mul- 2, respectively. The generation of mul- 3 and mul- 4 was attributable to recombination between the pair of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of “TCCC”, similar to mul- 2. Another pair of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of the 3 -bp sequence “GGG” were present {{in relation to the}} duplication of mul- 1. Thus, recombination between a pair of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> was assumed {{to be involved in the}} generation of multiplications in a manner similar to the generation of deletions, on the region encompassing reiteration VII of HSV- 1, indicating the importance of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> in DNA rearrangement.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a system to}} measure the frequency of both deletions and duplications between <b>direct</b> <b>repeats.</b> Short 17 - and 18 -bp palindromic and nonpalindromic DNA sequences were cloned into the EcoRI site within the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene of plasmids pBR 325 and pJT 7. This creates an insert between <b>direct</b> <b>repeated</b> EcoRI sites and results in a chloramphenicol-sensitive phenotype. Selection for chloramphenicol resistance was utilized to select chloramphenicol resistant revertants that included those with precise deletion of the insert from plasmid pBR 325 and duplication of the insert in plasmid pJT 7. The frequency of deletion or duplication varied more than 500 -fold depending on the sequence of the short sequence inserted into the EcoRI site. For the nonpalindromic inserts, multiple internal <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> {{and the length of}} the <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> appear to influence the frequency of deletion. Certain palindromic DNA sequences with the potential to form DNA hairpin structures that might stabilize the misalignment of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> had a high frequency of deletion. Other DNA sequences with the potential to form structures that might destabilize misalignment of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> had a very low frequency of deletion. Duplication mutations occurred at the highest frequency when the DNA between the <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> contained no <b>direct</b> or inverted <b>repeats.</b> The presence of inverted repeats dramatically reduced the frequency of duplications. The results support the slippage-misalignment model, suggesting that misalignment occurring during DNA replication leads to deletion and duplication mutations. The results also support the idea that the formation of DNA secondary structures during DNA replication can facilitate and direct specific mutagenic events...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the rolling-circle mode of {{replication}} and the generation of single-stranded DNA (ss DNA) on plasmid deletion formation between short <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> in Bacillus subtilis were studied. Deletion units consisting of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> (9, 18, or 27 bp) that do or do not flank inverted repeats (300 bp) were introduced into various plasmid replicons that generate different amounts of ss DNA (from 0 % to 40 % of the total plasmid DNA). With ss DNA-generating rolling-circle-type plasmids, deletion frequencies between the <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> were 3 - to 13 -fold higher than in plasmids not generating ss DNA. When the <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> flanked inverted repeats the deletion frequencies in ss DNA-generating plasmids were increased {{by as much as}} 20 - to 140 -fold. These results support models for deletion formation based on template-switching errors during complementary strand synthesis of rolling-circle-type plasmids.

40|$|Small <b>direct</b> <b>repeats,</b> {{which are}} {{frequent}} in all genomes, are a {{potential source of}} genome instability. To study the occurrence and genetic control of repeat-associated deletions, we developed a system in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{that was based on}} small <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> separated by either random sequences or inverted repeats. Deletions were examined in the LYS 2 gene, using a set of 31 - to 156 -bp inserts that included inserts with no apparent potential for secondary structure as well as two quasipalindromes. All inserts were flanked by 6 - to 9 -bp <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of LYS 2 sequence, providing an opportunity for Lys+ reversion via precise excision. Reversions could arise by extended deletions involving either <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> or random sequences and by - 1 -or + 2 -bp frameshift mutations. The deletion breakpoints were always associated with short (3 - to 9 -bp) perfect or imperfect <b>direct</b> <b>repeats.</b> Compared with the POL+ strain, deletions between small <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> were increased as much as 100 -fold, and the spectrum was changed in a temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase delta pol 3 -t mutant, suggesting a role for replication. The type of deletion depended on orientation relative to the origin of replication. On the basis of these results, we propose (i) that extended deletions between small repeats arise by replication slippage and (ii) that the deletions occur primarily in either the leading or lagging strand. The RAD 50 and RAD 52 genes, which are required for the recombinational repair of many kinds of DNA double-strand breaks, appeared to be required also for the production of up to 90 % of the deletions arising between separated repeats in the pol 3 -t mutant, suggesting a newly identified role for these genes in genome stability and possibly replication...|$|R

A module in which the GAL 1 gene is flanked by <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of the bacterial CAT gene was constructed and used to disrupt one copy of the URA 3 gene in a gal 1 mutant. Gal(-) revertants were selected by plating on 2 -deoxy-D-galactose (2 DOG).

However, a RA responsive element (beta RARE) was previously identified in the promoter of the RAR beta 2 gene which contains two <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of the motif GTTCA spaced by a six nucleotide gap. We now demonstrate the ability of RAR alpha, beta and gamma to bind to and transactivate through this element and that the two <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> comprise the beta RARE. Surprisingly, the GTTCA motifs rearranged to form a palindrome do not confer RA responsiveness to a heterologous promoter. Furthermore, no significant level of transactivation is detected by ligand-activated RAR through the Moloney murine leukaemia virus T 3 RE, which comprises two <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> of the sequence GGTCA/C spaced by a five nucleotide gap. Similarly, T 3 R does not induce gene expression through the beta RARE. This study establishes the preference of T 3 R to transactivate through <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> spaced by a five nucleotide gap {{as opposed to a}} six nucleotide gap. In contrast, RAR appears to be more flexible with respect to spacing requirements between repeats, although higher levels of transactivation are obtained through <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> spaced by a six nucleotide gap.

In this work, quantitative binding studies and DNase I footprinting analysis were performed to calculate the equilibrium dissociation constant and further characterize the binding site of ComE.

Strain CH 107 GTF has three internal <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> deleted; the 59 carboxyl-terminal amino acids are identical to those of the parental strain. This deletion resulted in decreased enzyme activity but did not affect the amount of cell-associated GTF protein. The GTFs of strains CH 2 RPE and CH 4 RPE have six and eight <b>direct</b> <b>repeats,</b> respectively, but are both missing the 14 carboxyl-terminal amino acids. Strain CH 2 RPE had significantly decreased levels of cell-associated GTF; this decrease was not obviated by the increased number of <b>direct</b> <b>repeats</b> in strain CH 4 RPE. Thus, the carboxyl-terminal amino acids appeared to influence the amount of cell-associated GTF more than the <b>direct</b> <b>repeats.</b> The qualitative and quantitative differences in the GTFs did not affect the abilities of these strains to accumulate on hydroxyapatite beads in the absence of sucrose. However, when sucrose was added as a substrate for GTF, the mutant strains were unable to accumulate on these surfaces to the same extent as the parent.
