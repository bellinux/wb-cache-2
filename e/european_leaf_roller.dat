40|$|The {{distributions}} of <b>European</b> <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> egg masses, deposited in 2001 and 2002, were examined on Stark Crimson, Stark Spure Golden and Misket cultivars of apple (Malus communis L.) in Eastern Mediterranean Region of Turkey. From 70 - 80 % {{of the egg}} masses were found on main and secondary branches in the canopy of the trees. Regression model provided expected vertical distribution of total numbers of egg masses on all plant parts in several heights intervals. On main and secondary branches, females discriminated in ovipozition by laying more egg masses in the southern and eastern quadrant and 80 - 160 cm heights intervals rather than other parts and heights. There were statistically significant differences among {{the mean number of}} egg masses found on the three apple cultivars. The highest population of mean number of egg masses was found on Stark Crimson and Golden and the lowest population was on Misket...|$|E

40|$|The {{importance}} of mutualism is receiving more attention in community ecology. In this study, the fire ant Solenopsis invicta {{was found to}} take advantage of the shelters constructed by the <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> Sylepta derogata to protect mealybugs (Phenacoccus solenopsis) against their natural enemies. This protective effect of fire ant tending on the survival of mealybugs in shelters was observed when enemies and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> were simultaneously present. Specifically, fire ants moved the mealybugs inside the shelters produced by S. derogata on enemy-infested plants. Compared with that in plants without ants, the survival of mealybugs in shelters in the presence of natural enemies in plants with ants markedly improved. Both the protection of ants and the shelters provided by <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> did not affect the survival of mealybugs in the absence of enemies in plants. Ants and <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> significantly improved the survival of mealybugs in predator-infested plants, whereas no such improvement was observed in parasitoid-infested ones...|$|R

40|$|Field {{experiments}} were {{conducted during the}} 2012 and 2013 cropping seasons at the University of Maiduguri to compared the efficacies of selected aqueous plant extracts on {{the management of the}} population of eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> (Eublemma olivacea Wlk.) infesting eggplant (Solanum melongena L.). The extracts were from neem leaf; bitter melon; black current; ginger rhizome and wild onion. They were compared with a conventional insecticide, Lambdacot 500 EC and the absolute control. Extracts were applied at 5 % w/v while Lambdacot was applied at 1. 5 g a. i/ha. The results indicated that the mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> in treated plots were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower than the control. The highest mean number of <b>leaf</b> <b>rollers</b> was 3. 01 and 3. 93. Lambdacot 500 EC had the lowest eggplant <b>leaf</b> <b>roller</b> counts per plant followed by neem, ginger rhizome and wild onion. The mean number of leaves damaged per plant followed similar trend. There was significantly (P< 0. 05) higher number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield in the decreasing order of Lambdacot 500 EC, neem, wild onion, bitter melon and black current. The absolute control had the fewest number of eggplant fruits/plant, fruit weight and fruit yield. These aqueous extracts should be adopted by eggplant farmers as they are cost effective and friendly to the environment. However, the actual quantities of these extracts to be applied per plant depending on the variety of eggplant, season and weather condition of the cropping season and canopy architecture remain to be critically explored...|$|R
