50|$|It was Tim <b>Johns</b> (<b>1991),</b> however, {{who raised}} {{the profile of}} the use of {{concordancers}} in the language classroom with his concept of Data-driven learning (DDL). DDL encourages learners to work out their own rules about the meaning of words and their usage by using a concordancer to locate examples in a corpus of authentic texts. It is also possible for the teacher to use a concordancer to find examples of authentic usage to demonstrate a point of grammar or typical collocations, and to generate exercises based on the examples found. Various types of concordancers and where they can be obtained are described by Lamy & Klarskov Mortensen (2011).|$|E

40|$|Corpus {{studies of}} native speaker and learner {{language}} have been influential in informing syllabus design and course content in foreign or second language (L 2) teaching.

Such an approach {{is alleged to have}} many advantages, including fostering learner autonomy, increasing language awareness and noticing skills, and improving ability to deal with authentic language. Although such theoretical arguments may seem convincing, their power is mitigated by the fact that DDL has yet to filter down into mainstream teaching and learning practices. In other words, it may be fine in theory, but what about in everyday practice? Empirical evidence in support of the theory would seem essential...|$|E

40|$|URL] This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a small action research project conducted in a course on translation of general texts from German into Spanish. The project methodology combines creative writing techniques with those of data-driven learning put forward by <b>Johns</b> (<b>1991)</b> for foreign language learning and applied by Laviosa (2014, in press) to translator training, {{as well as with the}} methods of corpus use for learning to translate proposed by Marco and Van Lawick (2009). The aim of the project is threefold: (i) raising the students’ awareness on the possibility of interference between German and Spanish past tenses when translating narrative sequences; (ii) allowing the students practicing data-driven learning about translation issues, and (iii) observing if these interventions bring about a qualitative change in their translation performance, specifically in the decrease of interference when translating narrative sequences with past tenses from German into Spanish. In the paper, special attention will be paid to the theoretical basis of the project, as well as to the methodological decisions involved in its design...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a vast {{increase}} {{in the amount of}} materials such as dictionaries and grammars which are ‘corpus-based’ {{and it is difficult to}} dispute the contribution of corpus linguistics to English language description. There have also been many developments in the use of corpora in the classroom in data-driven learning (<b>Johns</b> <b>1991).</b> However, this rapid development in new technology has not been matched in teacher education provision. This paper aims to make a case for the inclusion of corpus linguistics in initial language teacher education. We argue that apart from enhancing teachers’ research skills and language awareness, language corpora can aid pedagogic awareness through the use of in-house classroom corpora, and raise sociocultural awareness through the comparative investigation of large-scale commercially available corpora. We also look at the theoretical and practical considerations that need to be taken into account in the integration of language corpora in a teacher education program. We conclude that it is vital, given the pervasive nature of language corpora and their findings (especially in published materials), that future teachers have the critical evaluative skills to discern and mediate for the needs of their learners.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{outlines}} how corpora (in printed, electronic or multi-modal form) {{can be used}} {{in language}} learning, an area often referred to as "data-driven learning" or DDL (<b>Johns</b> <b>1991).</b> The alleged advantages are numerous, but are in need of empirical support which is frequently claimed to be lacking in the field. However, over 80 studies have so far attempted to evaluate some aspect of corpus use by non-native speakers (Boulton 2010) : these are briefly reviewed as a whole, highlighting the general findings without ignoring problems. Empirical research is essential for the credibility of any aspect of language teaching and learning, and traditionally divides between qualitative and quantitative approaches (e. g. Richards 2009; Lazaraton 2005). Neither however is without its difficulties, as DDL research shows: quantitative studies tend to smooth over individual differences, and experimental design often leads to small or non-significant results; qualitative research can be difficult to interpret and extend beyond the initial context. The results of empirical DDL research are then reanalysed in the light of complex / dynamic systems theory (e. g. de Bot 2008; Larsen-Freeman & Cameron 2008), which allows for greater blending of qualitative and quantitative research methods, and better integration and evaluation of real classroom use...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the composition and}} application in teaching of the Contemporary written Italian corpus (CWIC), created at Griffith University {{as a resource for}} Italian students at intermediate level. Since 1998, CWIC has been used in our second-year and third-year courses, primarily as a reference tool while writing. Our rationale in introducing CWIC drew particularly on the idea that learners armed with a corpus can act as researchers who discover rules about language for themselves, by formulating and testing hypotheses with reference to authentic examples of word use in context, as outlined by <b>Johns</b> (<b>1991</b> b). We conducted a gradual and guided apprenticeship in corpus use over a whole semester, intended to prepare the students sufficiently to work independently with CWIC when a web-based version comes online. We then sought {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the students? investigations and identify the difficulties they encountered when working without a teacher. Although the students were very enthusiastic about using CWIC, our analysis of their investigations showed they were less successful than we had anticipated. In particular, it highlighted two types of problems ? in managing a hypothesis-testing process and in observation of data ? that significantly reduced their effectiveness in the ?learner as researcher? role. We are seeking to address these difficulties by changing the objectives and priorities of our training. A key element in our response is to introduce students to CWIC with an ?observe and borrow? mentality first, before progressing to an ?observe and derive rules? approach such as we had originally envisaged would be the norm.

40|$|The present {{investigation}} {{is intended to}} encourage reflection on culture and identity in the French as a foreign language classroom through work on selected French key-words relating to immigration and national identity. Following recent developments in the historiography of migrations (Teulières 2007; Létourneau 2009; Pitti 2008), a pedagogical approach to French multicultural society was proposed to tertiary students of French in Australia, through the exploration {{of a variety of}} vocabulary items relating to people, places and issues. Firstly the researcher identified relevant key-words in French media discourses, and then the students who participated in a pedagogical trial analyzed meanings and use of these key-words. The method of analysis was informed by Corpus Linguistics (Sinclair 1996; Tognini-Bonelli 2000) according to Data-Driven Learning (<b>Johns</b> <b>1991),</b> which was applied to concordances extracted from news websites and blogs. In order to work on up-to-date language and culture, key-words and their surrounding linguistic context were retrieved through the Web from current media discourses which form part of the contemporary collective memory (Moirand 2007). The key-words selected evoked issues related to the cultural diversity in French society. The methodologically-mixed approach to the project we designed and the subsequent implementation of a pedagogical trial led to the identification of lexical networks for four key-words: "identité nationale", "enfants de l’immigration", "Français de souche" and "jeunes des banlieues". Moreover, this investigation devoted extensive attention to learners’ views, with regard to both their evaluations of the concordance-based activities implemented in 2008, and their experiences of multicultural backgrounds shared during a "table ronde" with French guests. The learners’ perspective on concordance-based activities is believed to assume great importance in the framework of applications of Corpus Linguistics (see, for instance, Yoon & Hirvela 2004). The experiences of multicultural identities which were narrated by participants in the "table ronde" revealed several forms of "hybridation" of cultural identities (Pitti 2008). This thesis is addressed to teachers of Foreign Languages wishing to use linguistic analysis as a means for learners to gain access to cultural understanding. Outcomes of the implemented pedagogical trial represent a socio-constructivist model which highlights the valuable contribution of students in terms of interpreting vocabulary, assessing learning processes and bearing witness to experiences of multicultural identity...|$|E

40|$|Despite English {{being the}} {{dominant}} language in HK tertiary education, expectations regarding {{the effectiveness of}} initial EAP programs are ‘unrealistic’ (Bruce & Hamp-Lyons, 2015). EAP course effectiveness is typically measured via the triangulation of test scores and student-led post-course evaluations of course and teacher performance, which are [unfortunately] both summative and subjective in nature and do not generally take into account assessment of the actual linguistic data that was produced over time, tracking student production from pre- to post- training. Such an investigation would constitute a new 'affordance' among the 'multiple affordances' (Leńko-Szymańska & Boulton, 2015) of language corpora currently available to educators, and would be particularly useful if course teachers {{were involved in the}} corpus design (e. g. Urzúa, 2015). The methodology involved the construction, annotation and analysis of a pilot learner corpora according to the principles of Granger's (2015) Contrastive Interlanguage Analysis (CIA 2), where 350, 000 words were taken longitudinally (pre-, mid- and post-EAP training) from written academic essays and reports. The corpus' annotation scheme was derived from EAP course content alongside consultation with course teachers, and includes annotation for over 20 error categories, the use of interpersonal and intertextual metadiscursive language (following Hyland, 2000), and the use of in-text citation / reference lists. Post-hoc analysis also includes multidimensional analysis (e. g. Biber, 1988) using the MAT program, (Nini, 2014). Corpus building and annotation was performed using UAMCorpustool (O'Donnell, 2008). Results There is little impact of instruction on common L 2 errors found between pre- and post-training data in most (but not all) categories. Variation in the use of key stance features including hedging, boosting, epistemic nouns, attitude markers and self-mentions suggests our L 2 writers are able to produce more nuanced positions on an academic topic. The results of the multidimensional analysis exhibit considerable variation between data points in the direction of academic discourse across all five dimensions analysed, including a drop in the use of first person pronouns and the mechanical use of discourse connectives, alongside an increased emphasis on nominalisation. The results provide one of the first quantitative, corpus-driven measures of EAP course effectiveness. The findings suggest a warmly positive effect of EAP instruction on learner production after only a single semester. A number of pedagogical opportunities for the data are also outlined including the benefits of such analysis for written corrective feedback and future analysis of discipline-specific L 2 discourse. The results will hopefully lead to improved data-driven course provision (e. g. <b>Johns,</b> <b>1991),</b> and as such are likely to be of great importance for ELT course administrators and teachers...|$|E
40|$|Ankara : Institute of Humanitites and Letters of Bilkent University, 1994. Thesis (Master's) [...] -Bilkent University, 1994. Includes bibliographical refences. Needs {{analysis}} {{is crucial for}} ESP (English for Specific Purposes) curricula because it provides valuable data in order to set the goals, objectives, and aims of a curriculum and contributes to the appropriateness of a curriculum for students' needs and purposes. <b>Johns</b> (<b>1991)</b> {{emphasizes the importance of}} needs analysis for ESP curricula, and states that ESP practitioners should develop new techniques to reveal the language tasks the learners will have to perform in their target situation instead of guessing at learners' target needs. The students of the Tourism Education Department of the Trade Business and Tourism Education Faculty of Gazi University in Ankara, Turkiye, take 4 - 6 class hours of English per week for tourism purposes. The lectures who are in charge of teaching ESP at the department write their syllabuses and select the course materials depending only on their intuitions about the students' communication needs in their future work domain. However, according to the results of preliminary informal interviews, these students are generally unsuccessful in communicating with their foreign interlocutors in English in the job settings where they do their summer apprenticeships. Therefore, considering that the learners' purposes in learning English and the communication requirements of the situation in which the learners will use English should be revealed, this study attempted to reveal the students' perceptions of their communication needs, as well as the ESP lecturers' and the tourism subject lecturers' perceptions of the students' communication needs. This study also attempted to reveal whether what is provided for the students in ESP classes at the Tourism Education Department meets what is required by the students' future work domain. In this study, data were collected from three different subject groups by means of three versions of the questionnaire. The subject groups consisted of 100 students, 10 tourism subject lecturers, and 3 ESP lecturers from the Tourism Education Department. The most notable finding gathered from the responses of the students and the ESP lecturers shows that the students did not practise frequent or effective speaking and listening activities in their ESP classes although all subject groups assumed that speaking and listening were the most important language skills in the students' future work domain. Despite this agreement, there were also discrepancies among the subject groups' perceptions of some issues. For instance, the students and the tourism subject lecturers considered translation the least important language skill, whereas ESP lectures saw translation the third most important language skill for the students' target situation, after speaking and listening. It is hoped that {{the findings of this study}} will be useful in designing a curriculum for the ESP classes at the Tourism Education Department of Trade Business and Tourism Education Faculty of Gazi University.

40|$|Corpus {{data can}} be used as {{teaching}} material, either directly or in a pre-edited form (Partington 2001 : 63). Learners can be trained to use corpora by themselves in order to carry out investigations into language use to identify and learn recurrent patterns in relation to context. Concordancing can provide teachers and learners with data that may help understand syntactic phenomena. They enable the user to look for recurrent patterns in the co-text, which may offer clues to the meaning and usage of the search word itself. However, since concordances do not offer explanations but simply data which need further analysis, this enhances the role of learners as “researchers” (<b>Johns</b> <b>1991).</b> Bernardini (2001 : 227) underlines the journey-like nature of corpus-based language activities with attention focused on an in-between point in the learning experience and on the mind-broadening potential of activities which stimulate the learner to observe and reflect on aspects of language and culture which they may never have focused on before. However, despite the huge amount of corpus-based and corpus-driven research carried out in recent years, as Gavioli points out “the use of corpora as tools in the hands of teachers and learners is moving on very hesitatingly” (2005 : 1). This study was meant to check if and to what extent Corpus Linguistics can be effectively used in teaching English to students of non-linguistic Faculties. It was primarily aimed at enhancing the students’ awareness both of the specific lexico-grammatical and syntactic features characterising the discourse of Foreign Relations and of the links existing between political/diplomatic discourse strategies and global as well as local socio-political issues. It is premised on the belief that learning a language can be greatly facilitated if one understands how language works and operates in a given textual environment being embedded in the discoursal practices of professional communities. Such a view has appeared to foster a genuine interest of the learners in the use of language to achieve communicative goals and in the analysis of discoursal practices. This report is structured as follows. In the first part (section 2) we put forward arguments that appear to encourage the adoption of Corpus Linguistics in the teaching of English in the Faculty of Political Science. In the second part (section 3) we illustrate the work carried out in the English Language course on a seminar-like basis as follows: a theoretical introduction to the use of Corpus Linguistics in the study of political discourse; a practical introduction to the use of corpus tools and methodology {{with the assistance of the}} teacher, in order to analyse texts already encountered by the students in the classroom; a final report written by the students as the outcome of corpus analysis carried out autonomously on small specialised corpora consisting of official documents about terrorism issued both by the United Nations and the White House...|$|E
