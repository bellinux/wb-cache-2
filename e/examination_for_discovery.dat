50|$|In {{the law of}} the United States, a {{deposition}} is the out-of-court oral testimony of a witness that is reduced to writing for later use in court or for discovery purposes. It is commonly used in litigation in the United States and Canada, where it is called <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery,</b> and is almost always conducted outside of court by the lawyers themselves (that is, the judge is not present to supervise the examination). In other countries, testimony is usually preserved for future use by way of live testimony in the courtroom, or by way of written affidavit.|$|E
50|$|The {{extraordinary}} {{contrast between}} civil procedure in jurisdictions {{where there are}} no oral examinations for discovery, for example in Australia and England, and North American practice, can be discerned by reading an extract from the New South Wales Law Reform Commission Report in 1978. The process is described in detail and aimed at an Australian audience. It is clear that the North American process is unfamiliar to Australian lawyers as the author witnessed an <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery</b> in Toronto and outlines in intricate detail the rules in Ontario as they were in effect at that time.|$|E
50|$|In Canada, {{the process}} is nearly {{identical}} but is called an <b>examination</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery.</b> In Australia, and England and Wales, {{there is no right}} of oral examination of opposing parties in civil litigation, save that in England and Wales the pre-litigation discovery process allows for each party to make written questions and the answers to those questions will be relied upon during if there is any discrepancy in the oral evidence given in Court. Oral examination is typically completed after pleadings and requests for particulars by exchange of affidavits of documents and sometimes written questions and answers (interrogatories). Often affidavits are exchanged before trial, but the first opportunity to orally question the opposing party's evidence is usually at trial.|$|E
50|$|The {{process is}} {{considered}} in Canada to be time consuming and expensive when conducted without limits. As a result, Rule 31.05.1 of the Ontario Rules of Civil Procedure has, since January 1, 2010, limited <b>examinations</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery</b> to seven hours per party except with {{consent of the}} other parties or the leave of the Court. British Columbia implemented similar reforms on July 1, 2010, although the new Rule 7-2(2) can be read in two ways, {{it appears to be}} that each party can examine each other party for a maximum of seven hours unless the court orders otherwise. The alternative reading is that each party is only to be examined for a maximum of seven hours.|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of the association between HLA in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) on chromosome 6 p 21 with type 1 diabetes, but not with type 2 diabetes, suggested that these disease entities were of different genetic background and pathogenesis. The discovery that some individuals with diabetes had autoantibodies in their blood provided additional evidence that type 1 diabetes had an autoimmune origin. Recently, increasing knowledge of the genome, coupled with rapidly improving genotyping technology and availability of increasingly large numbers of samples, has enabled statistically robust, systematic, genome-wide <b>examinations</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery</b> of loci contributing to type 1 diabetes susceptibility, including within the MHC itself. Currently, there are over 50 non-HLA regions that significantly affect the risk for type 1 diabete...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2014 Baltovich's lawyers {{applied to}} amend his {{statement}} of claim. Media reported that during <b>examinations</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery</b> related to Baltovich's civil suit, previously undisclosed forensic evidence had surfaced indicating that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould {{had met with}} two forensic experts three days after Baltovich's arrest in November 1990 during which time {{he was told that}} the police theory of the crime - that Baltovich had killed Elizabeth Bain on June 19, 1990, hidden her body nearby in Colonel Danforth Park and that he had returned three days later to retrieve her body and drive it out of Scarborough in her car - was not supported by the forensic evidence found in Bain's car and that, according to Baltovich's lawyers, the theory presented at Baltovich's first trial was [...] "flawed and untenable." [...] It is also alleged that Det. Sgt. Brian Raybould doctored his notes in an effort to conceal the existence of the meeting by removing pages referencing the meeting and replacing them with another page from his notes from a later date.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this volume is to present in a {{convenient}} and usable form a comparative study of the expedients which are being employed in various American and English jurisdictions {{for the purpose of}} facilitating pre-trial practice, to describe the practical operation of the different devices, and to show their effect upon the general administration of justice. An analysis of the statutory and case law has been combined with data which shows the practical operation of the procedure in the everyday work of the lawyer and judge. Field studies were made by the author in different cities of the following fourteen jurisdictions for the purpose of ascertaining the experience of the profession with each type of device which is being used: Indiana, Kansas, Kentucky, Massachusetts, Missouri, Nebraska, New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Ontario, Quebec, Texas, and Wisconsin. Interviews were sought with representative judges, lawyers, and where there were such, officials in charge of discovery examinations. Other means employed in obtaining information included the study of trial court records of <b>examinations</b> <b>for</b> <b>discovery,</b> observation of actual examinations and· correspondence with lawyers in states other than those in which field investigations were made.
