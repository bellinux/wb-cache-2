In France, the Ministry of Agriculture commissioned an <b>expert</b> <b>group,</b> the Scientific and Technical Committee for the Multifactorial Study on Bees (CST), to study the intoxicating and sometimes fatal effects of chemicals used in agriculture on bees. Researchers at the Bee Research Institute and the Department of Food Chemistry and Analysis in the Czech Republic have pondered the intoxicating effects of various chemicals used to treat winter rapeseed crops. Romania suffered a severe case of widespread bee intoxication and extensive bee mortality from deltamethrin in 2002. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) even has published standards for testing chemicals for bee intoxication.|$|E

40|$|In every {{political}} system {{there is an}} inbuilt tension between how a government {{is supposed to be}} organized and operate and how it really functions. The official version of how a government is organized is always complemented and sometimes even contradicted by an informal version. How the informal structure or the shadow world of government is formatted, and by whom, is of crucial importance for how power and influence is distributed in a {{political system}}. This study has carried out an analysis of one part of the informal structure of the EU and its relationship with the formal structure. Thus the focus of the study has been on <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> and their primary instigator-the Commission. In this framework three questions have been raised. Firstly, taking into account the Commission's tight to set up <b>expert</b> <b>groups,</b> to what extent is this tool used and what type of <b>expert</b> <b>groups</b> ere set up?

25|$|However, {{according}} to a 2014 report by the World Health Organizations Expert Committee on Drug Dependence '"....in many cases of tramadol dependence, a history of substance abuse is present....but....the evidence for physical dependence was considered minimal. Consequently, Tramadol is generally considered as a drug with low potential for dependence. In a recent German study (including a literature study, an analysis of two drug safety databases, and questionnaires analyses), the low abuse and low dependence potential of Tramadol were re-confirmed. The German <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> found a low prevalence of abuse or dependence in clinical practice in Germany, and concluded that Tramadol has a low potential for misuse, abuse, and dependence in Germany”.|$|E

In February 2010, the All-Party Parliamentary Group on ME (APPG on ME) produced a legacy paper, which welcomed the recent MRC initiative, but felt {{that there has been}} far too much emphasis in the past on psychological research, with insufficient attention to biomedical research, and that it is vital that further biomedical research be undertaken to help discover a cause and more effective forms of management for this disease.|$|E
25|$|The 1st European Coastal Conservation Conference 1991, {{organised}} by the EUCC and the Dutch government, {{marked the}} start of the development of Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM) as a policy approach in the European Community.

EUCC was invited by the European Commission to join the EU ICZM Expert Group; Dr. Alan Pickaver was EUCC’s representative in this <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> until August 2013. As a result, a novel means for Member States to measure the progress they are making on ICZM implementation through the use of indicators was developed.

25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the SFR {{developed}} {{a proposal for}} a new east-west trunkline (German: Haupttransversale, NHT). This was considered by the Swiss Transport Commission (German: Schweizerischen Gesamtverkehrskommission, GVK). In 1977, after almost six years work, the GVK submitted a 400-page report, which recommended {{the construction of a new}} railway between Geneva and Lake Constance and between Basel and Olten. On these routes, a total of 120 kilometres of new line would allow operation of trains at up to 200 kilometres per hour, similar to the French TGVs. A Federal Government committee supported SFR's proposal but considered that investment should be initially concentrated on the sections of route between Basel, Olten and Bern. This proposal was widely seen as too narrow in its benefits and in mid 1984 the SFR established an <b>expert</b> <b>group</b> under the name Rail 2000 to develop a broader approach. This group developed a plan to improve rail transport throughout Switzerland based on the approach of co-ordinated regular interval trains. The federal parliament voted to approve Rail 2000 in May 1986. In particular, it granted CHF 5.4 billion for the Mattstetten–Rothrist new line between Olten and Bern and for a connection from near Herzogenbuchsee to Solothurn. This was endorsed by a referendum in 1987 with a majority of 57.0%.|$|E
