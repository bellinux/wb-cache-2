40|$|The debt {{collection}} process in Anglo-American law {{is based on}} the creditor 2 ̆ 7 s right to receive payment from liquidation of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets. Judicial procedures are available to the unsecured creditor for the purpose of converting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets to cash.

It is an economic necessity for creditors to have an efficient collection mechanism which gives them maximum protection in the event of default by <b>the</b> <b>debtor.</b> Nonetheless, all states shield <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> from complete destitution by keeping certain property, for example, life insurance proceeds, beyond the reach of creditors. By permitting <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> to keep those assets necessary for his economic survival, state exemption laws fulfill important social policies which must be balanced against the need for creditor protection. When a debtor files a petition in bankruptcy, the bankruptcy trustee takes title to most of <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s property, thereby enabling the trustee to liquidate <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> 2 ̆ 7 s assets for the benefit of creditors.

40|$|Several {{problems}} {{will be presented}} in this paper, which are, what are the reasons used by <b>the</b> bank in <b>determining</b> if <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> has violated <b>the</b> agreement and in <b>determining</b> <b>the</b> necessity of expropriating debtor's assets (ES), in form of land and building, to resolve failed credit? How is the execution of failed credit resolution process through <b>the</b> expropriation of <b>debtor's</b> assets (ES) in form of land and building, applied to <b>the</b> <b>debtor</b> violating <b>the</b> agreement? In analyzing the above-mentioned problems, the writer uses an empirical method, meaning that this research refers to the law and order connected with the discussed problems by observing literature materials or secondary data {{in connection with the}} subjects that will be discussed, connected to the practices in the site, thus, the data collected from the site are able to be examined using the utilized literature materials. Both kinds of the above-mentioned data (data collected from the site and literature materials) are processed using a qualitative analysis. In <b>determining</b> failed credit, <b>the</b> bank uses 3 (three) bases of assessment aspects, which are, business prospect, performance, and ability to perform credit payment. From those three aspects, the collectible levels can be determined, which are, smooth, under a certain attention, not so smooth, doubted, and failed. If the credit is failed, therefore, the bank will conduct various resolution measures; one of them is by conducting debtor's asset expropriation (ES) provided to the bank as security. ES is conducted because of the complicated matters of Security Rights and the rising number of failed credits in a short term, influencing negatively on the level of Sell- Buy Binding Agreement (SBBA) and Authority to Sell, which certainly bring risks to the bank itself because SBBA has not transferred the ownership status upon the security object to the buyer. This is conducted because there are still many obstacles in the execution of ES, such as, legal terms limiting subject who may have a property right upon land, high tax, expropriation process with a short tern, and so on. Therefore, a breakthrough in the terms of law and order that are able to accommodate all obstacles in ES execution is required. One of them is such as what have been applied to the Indonesian Banking Restructuring Agency. To realize the above terms of law and order, therefore, cooperation among the authorized institutions related to ES execution is required...|$|R
