O’Rourke has developed solutions for foundation performance, structure ground movement effects, <b>earth</b> <b>retaining</b> structures, pipelines, earthquake engineering, tunneling, and infrastructure rehabilitation. He assisted in development of advanced polymer and composite materials for the rehabilitation of infrastructure distribution systems. He developed techniques to evaluate ground movement patterns and stability for excavation, tunneling, micro-tunneling, and mining systems. He developed strategies to reduce damage during earthquakes, analyze and design high pressure pipelines, and established testing facilities for both transmission and distribution pipelines. O’Rourke developed geographical information systems and network analysis procedures for water supply systems in areas vulnerable to earthquakes and other natural disasters.|$|E

5000|$|O’Rourke is a Geotechnical {{engineer}} and a subject-matter expert on natural disasters {{and their impact}} on the infrastructure supporting civil society. Geotechnical engineers study the Earth’s near-surface crust and its performance under stress. They analyze how structures buried in the ground behave in an environment of change, structures such as subway systems, water and gas pipelines, etc. They, for instance, study underground spaces such as parking garages, skyscraper foundations and subfloors and they also evaluate how structures made of soil and/or rock behave, structures such as earth dams, highway embankments, and levies. [...] O’Rourke served on the National Academy of Engineering (NAE) team studying Hurricane Katrina and its effect on the Gulf Coast. Funded in part by the Charles L.

A specialist in geotechnical engineering including foundations, <b>earth</b> <b>retaining</b> structures, slope stability, soil/structure interaction, underground construction, laboratory testing, and elements of earthquake engineering, O’Rourke has written extensively on geotechnical, underground, and earthquake engineering.

50|$|During the {{relaunch}} of the Green Lantern {{series in}} The New 52, Jordan {{is back to}} his civilian life on Earth. He has been discharged from the United States Air Force. Jordan is arrested and Carol bails him out. She offers him a job, but not as a pilot. They go on a date but Carol is enraged when Jordan fails to propose marriage. He is then confronted by Sinestro who offers him a Green Lantern ring. A ring he created himself and has complete control over, telling Hal if he wants his real ring back he will help him destroy the Sinestro Corps who have enslaved Korugar during his absence. Before they leave for Korugar Green Lantern wants {{to say goodbye to}} Carol but Sinestro does not let him, stating that doing {{what needs to be done}} is more important than a failed romance. When the two arrive at Korugar, Green Lantern is tasked by Sinestro in deactivating the central yellow power battery, as he explains that only a Green Lantern can do it. However, when Green Lantern gets to the battery, it begins to disintegrate him. Before he is fully disintegrated, he expresses his belief that Sinestro set him up. The disintegration is revealed to be an opening portal to the Anti-Matter Universe, and when the battery realizes Green Lantern is not Sinestro, the transport is aborted, and an unconscious Green Lantern is deposited outside the battery, amidst a crowd of Yellow Lanterns. He is then imprisoned in a cell meant to foil escape attempts by draining power from his green ring. With his last power left in his ring Green Lantern creates an image of Carol. When Sinestro is caught and imprisoned in a nearby cell, Hal suggests using the last of Sinestro's power to split his ring into hundreds of copies to be used by the captive Korugarans. The plan works, but the Korugarans close in on Sinestro, preparing to take their revenge, before Hal convinces them to use their power against the Sinestro Corps instead. After they drain the Sinestro Corps power battery and defeat most of the Corps, Green Lantern is returned to <b>Earth</b> <b>retaining</b> the ring Sinestro gave him without any means of charging it. The next day he finds Carol and begs her to take him back, explaining that she was the last thing he wanted to see when he was absolutely certain that he was going to die.

5000|$|Superplume/superswell {{creation}} {{is a large}} upwelling of material. Normal upwellings in the mantle are a common occurrence, as it is generally accepted that these upwellings are {{the driving force behind}} mantle convection and subsequent plate motion. In the case of the upwelling in the mid-Cretaceous Period along the East Pacific Rise, its origin lies deep within the earth, near the core-mantle boundary. This conclusion is taken {{from the fact that the}} <b>earth</b> <b>retained</b> a constant field polarity at the same time that this upwelling occurred. [...] A more current superplume/superswell is in the southern and eastern region of Africa. Seismic analysis shows a large low-shear-velocity province, which coincides with a region of upwelling of semi-liquid material which is a poor conductor of seismic waves. [...] While there are several processes at work in the formation of these high topography zones, lithospheric thinning and lithospheric heating have been unable to predict the topographic upwelling on the African plate. Dynamic topography models have, on the other hand, been able to predict this upwelling utilizing calculations of the instantaneous flow of Earth's mantle.|$|R
