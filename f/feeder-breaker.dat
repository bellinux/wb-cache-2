40|$|In this U. S. Bureau of Mines study, four {{underground}} {{respirable dust}} surveys {{were conducted to}} determine factors affecting belt entry dust levels and how using belt air to ventilate work areas affected dust exposures. Belt entry dust levels on the surveyed longwall and continuous miner sections averaged 0. 59 and 0. 26 Mg/m 3, respectively. The stageloader-crusher contributed an additional 0. 5 to 0. 9 Mg/m 3 of dust to belt air, while the <b>feeder-breaker</b> contributed 0 to 0. 2 Mg/m 3 of dust. A 1, 000 -ft increase in belt entry length or a 200 - to 500 -st-per-shift increase in production resulted in roughly a 0. 1 -Mg/m 3 increase in dust. Using the belt entry as an intake entry on the continuous miner section appeared to reduce dust levels by 0. 1 to 0. 3 Mg/m 3 during cutting. Belt air {{was not used to}} ventilate the face on the longwall section. " - NIOSTHTIC- 2 NIOSHTIC no. 1001144...|$|E
40|$|At {{the request}} of the Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) the Bureau of Mines {{evaluated}} the potential hazards of three compressed oxygen self-contained self-rescuers (SCSR's) designed for use in under-ground coal mines. The evaluation followed the lines used in a similar investigation of chemical self-rescuers and involved laboratory experiments as well as field trials designed to simulate a mining environment. They included bullet impact, bonfire, <b>feeder-breaker</b> impact and feed-through, and mining machine runover tests. The work showed that the units were not inherently unsafe but that under certain conditions of extreme abuse they can present a potential ignition or explosion hazard. This, coupled with a survey of reported damage on SCSR's currently deployed in underground mines, which indicated a relatively high frequency of incidents leading to the destruc-tion of the units, led to new recommendations on the deployment of SCSR's. The recommendations formulated by MSHA state that the units should be either properly worn by the miner, stored in heavy containers, or otherwise protected from situations in which they might be accidentally ruptured or destroyed, such as runover by mobile mining equipment...|$|E
