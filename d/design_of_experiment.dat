Statistical <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> allows to set the level and to {{determine the influence of}} factors on the results of realized process as well as helps to improve its economic results. The aim of this article is the issue of the proper order of experimental trials realization of certain <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> {{in order to reduce the}} cost of its implementation. For this particular problem will be presented an algorithm of <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> which uses properly constructed matrix.

The <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> is then presented in chapters 3 and 4. Chapter 3 {{is divided into}} several subchapters in which its brief history is provided {{as well as its}} complex theoretic description (basic principles, steps for planning, etc.). Chapter 4 deals with particular types of the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiment</b> (Factorial experiments or Response surface design).

50|$|The Bayesian <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> {{includes}} a concept called 'influence of prior beliefs'. This approach uses sequential analysis techniques {{to include the}} outcome <b>of</b> earlier <b>experiments</b> in the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> the next <b>experiment.</b> This is achieved by updating 'beliefs' {{through the use of}} prior and posterior distribution. This allows the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> to make good use of resources of all types. An example of this is the multi-armed bandit problem.|$|R
40|$|The {{polynomial}} chaos expansion (PCE) is {{an efficient}} numerical method for performing a reliability analysis. It relates {{the output of}} a nonlinear system with the uncertainty in its input parameters using a multidimensional polynomial approximation (the so-called PCE). Numerically, such an approximation {{can be obtained by}} using a regression method with a suitable <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments.</b> The cost <b>of</b> this approximation depends on the size <b>of</b> the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments.</b> If the <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> is large and the system is modeled with a computationally expensive FEA (Finite Element Analysis) model, the PCE approximation becomes unfeasible. The aim of this work is to propose an algorithm that generates efficiently a <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> <b>of</b> a size defined by the user, {{in order to make the}} PCE approximation computationally feasible. It is an optimization algorithm that seeks to find the best <b>design</b> <b>of</b> <b>experiments</b> in the D-optimal sense for the PCE. This algorithm is a coupling between genetic algorithms and the Fedorov exchange algorithm. The efficiency of our approach in terms of accuracy and computational time reduction is compared with other existing methods in the case of analytical functions and finite element based functions...|$|R
