5|$|A judge banned all filming {{but this}} ruling was {{overturned}} by an injunction. Although officials were angry, the residents were not and Jackson {{was surrounded by}} crowds of enthusiastic onlookers during filming. One woman managed to push through security to hug Jackson who continued dancing while hugging her. Another woman appeared and <b>hugged</b> <b>him</b> from behind. He then {{fell to the ground}} as police pulled the two women off him and escorted them away. After the director helped Jackson get up off the street, he continued to sing and dance. This incident made it into the music video. 1,500 policemen and 50 residents acting as security guards effectively sealed off the Dona Marta favela. Some residents and officials found it offensive that Jackson's production team had negotiated with drug dealers in order to gain permission to film in one of the city's shantytowns.|$|E
25|$|Wojtyła {{became the}} 264th pope {{according}} to the chronological list of popes, the first non-Italian in 455 years. At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope since Pope Pius IX in 1846, who was 54. Like his predecessor, John PaulII dispensed with the traditional Papal coronation and instead received ecclesiastical investiture with a simplified Papal inauguration on 22 October 1978. During his inauguration, when the cardinals were to kneel before him to take their vows and kiss his ring, he stood up as the Polish prelate Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński knelt down, stopped him from kissing the ring, and simply <b>hugged</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Since 2005, Abdul-Jabbar {{has served}} as special {{assistant}} coach for the Lakers. Abdul-Jabbar had been interested in coaching since his retirement, and given the influence he had on the league, {{he thought that the}} opportunity would present itself. However, during his playing years, Abdul-Jabbar had developed a reputation of being introverted and sullen. He did not speak to the press, leading to the impression that he disliked them. In his biography My Life, Magic Johnson recalls instances when Abdul-Jabbar brushed him off when Magic (as a ball boy) asked for his autograph, Abdul-Jabbar froze out reporters who gave him a too enthusiastic handshake or even <b>hugged</b> <b>him,</b> and refused to stop reading the newspaper while giving an interview.|$|E

25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had put his arm around Kelvin and <b>hugged</b> <b>him</b> because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E

500|$|Several {{changes were}} made to the final shows in Los Angeles after the September 11 attacks: Madonna wore an American flag kilt during the show's opening segment as a display of patriotism, the closing of [...] "Mer Girl" [...] (part II) was altered to remove the staged {{shooting}} of a character; Madonna instead put the gun down, <b>hugged</b> <b>him</b> and they left the stage together.

Additionally, as a surprise for Madonna at the final concert date, her husband at the time, Guy Ritchie, appeared as the lost technician at the end of [...] "Beautiful Stranger", the Samurai during [...] "Sky Fits Heaven" [...] wore Los Angeles Lakers jerseys. Also, all of the dancers joined in for the final dance section of [...] "Holiday", which usually only featured Madonna and her two backing singers.

2500|$|After he {{concluded}} his eloquent arguments, Secretary of War Edwin Stanton <b>hugged</b> <b>him,</b> declaring [...] "Carpenter, you have saved us!" [...] Even McCardle's attorney Jeremiah S. Black lauded him as [...] "the first Constitutional {{lawyer in the}} country." [...] However, Radical Republicans in Congress feared that the reconstruction acts would be ruled unconstitutional, so they quickly pushed through a law repealing the Habeas Corpus Act of 1867, barring jurisdiction in pending cases and preventing a clear decision from being rendered by the court.|$|E

[...] Ever since they went on a scuba-diving trip together in 1993, he said, Lewis had referred to him as his [...] "diving buddy." [...] They occasionally dined together or met at political functions, Wilkes said.

2500|$|In 1945, Brando's agent {{recommended}} he take a co-starring role in The Eagle Has Two Heads with Tallulah Bankhead, {{produced by}} Jack Wilson. Bankhead had {{turned down the}} role of Blanche Dubois in A Streetcar Named Desire, which Williams had written for her, to tour the play for the 1946-1947 season. Bankhead recognized Brando's potential, despite her disdain (which most Broadway veterans shared) for method acting, and agreed to hire him even though he auditioned poorly. The two clashed greatly during the pre-Broadway tour, with Bankhead reminding Brando of his mother, being her age and also having a drinking problem. Wilson was largely tolerant of Brando's behavior, but he reached his limit when Brando mumbled through a dress rehearsal shortly before the November 28, 1946, opening. [...] "I don't care what your grandmother did," [...] Wilson exclaimed, [...] "and that Method stuff, I {{want to know what}} you're going to do!" [...] Brando in turn raised his voice, and acted with great power and passion. [...] "It was marvelous," [...] a cast member recalled. [...] "Everybody <b>hugged</b> <b>him</b> and kissed him. He came ambling offstage and said to me, 'They don't think you can act unless you can yell.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|To promote Music and Ray of Light, Madonna {{embarked}} on her fifth concert tour, the Drowned World Tour. It started in June 2001 and was Madonna's first tour {{in eight years}} since The Girlie Show World Tour (1993). The tour was to be started before the year 2000, but she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released Music that year, and married Guy Ritchie in December 2000. When Madonna finally decided {{to go on the}} tour, time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months. Jamie King was signed up as the creative director and the choreographer of the show. The tour was divided into five segments, namely punk, geisha, cowboy, Latin and ghetto. Each segment represented a phase of Madonna's career. Several changes were made to the final shows in Los Angeles after the September 11 attacks: Madonna wore an American flag kilt during the show's opening segment as a display of patriotism, the closing of [...] "Mer Girl" [...] (part II) was altered to remove the staged shooting of a character; Madonna instead put the gun down, <b>hugged</b> <b>him</b> and they left the stage together. The macabre cannibalism-themed [...] "Funny Song" [...] was removed. The tour received positive reviews. The tour was a commercial success, grossing a total of US$75 million, and it was the top concert tour of a solo artist in 2001. The tour received the Major Tour of the Year and Most Creative Stage Production awards nominations at the 2001 Pollstar awards, but lost them to U2. The concert was broadcast live on HBO from The Palace of Auburn Hills in Auburn Hills, Michigan [...] August 26, 2001. The Drowned World Tour 2001 DVD was released in all regions on November 13, 2001.|$|E
