25|$|Widespread {{distribution}} of Permo-Carboniferous glacial sediments in South America, Africa, Madagascar, Arabia, India, Antarctica and Australia {{was one of}} the major pieces of evidence for the theory of continental drift. The continuity of glaciers, inferred from oriented glacial striations and deposits called tillites, suggested the existence of the supercontinent of Gondwana, which became a central element of the concept of continental drift. Striations indicated <b>glacial</b> <b>flow</b> away from the equator and toward the poles, based on continents' current positions and orientations, and supported the idea that the southern continents had previously been in dramatically different locations, as well as being contiguous with each other.|$|E
2500|$|Erratics {{provide an}} {{important}} tool in characterizing the directions of glacier flows, which are routinely reconstructed used {{on a combination of}} moraines, eskers, drumlins, meltwater channels, and similar data. [...] Erratic distributions and glacial till properties allow for identification of the source rock from which they derive, which confirms the flow direction, particularly when the erratic source outcrop is unique to a limited locality. Erratic materials may be transported by multiple glacier flows prior to their deposition, which can complicate the reconstruction of the <b>glacial</b> <b>flow.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{evidence}} {{in favour of}} <b>glacial</b> <b>flow</b> was known by the early 19th century, other theories of glacial motion were advanced, such as the idea that melt water, refreezing inside glaciers, caused the glacier to dilate and extend its length. As {{it became clear that}} glaciers behaved to some degree as if the ice were a viscous fluid, it was argued that [...] "regelation", or the melting and refreezing of ice at a temperature lowered by the pressure on the ice inside the glacier, was what allowed the ice to deform and flow. [...] James Forbes came up with the essentially correct explanation in the 1840s, although it was several decades before it was fully accepted.|$|E

Dissecting that track further, the Punknews review found that “he structure of repeating themes with an underlying 'storyline' is more like the classical Aristotelean narrative than a song; with no conventional verses, choruses or anything else familiar to be found.” ...|$|E

50|$|In geology, a {{palimpsest}} is {{a geographical}} feature composed of superimposed structures created at different times.

50|$|The {{subglacial}} {{layout of}} valley tunnels/channels is predominantly oriented parallel to <b>glacial</b> ice <b>flow</b> lines - essentially they stretch from areas of thicker sheet ice toward areas of thinner sheet ice.

50|$|In {{addition}} to rock covered glaciers around mesas, {{the region has}} many steep-walled valleys with lineations—ridges and grooves—on their floors. The material comprising these valley floors is called lineated valley fill. In {{some of the best}} images taken by the Viking Orbiters, some of the valley fill appeared to resemble alpine glaciers on Earth. Given this similarity, some scientists assumed that the lineations on these valley floors might have formed by flow of ice in (and perhaps through) these canyons and valleys. Today, it is generally agreed that <b>glacial</b> <b>flow</b> caused the lineations.|$|E

However, models of <b>glacial</b> <b>flow</b> in the smaller present-day ice sheets show that a probable maximum value for sea level rise in the next century is 80 centimeters, based on limitations on how quickly ice can flow below the equilibrium line altitude and to the sea.|$|E

40|$|A {{finite element}} {{computer}} code {{for the analysis}} of mantle convection is described. The coupled equations for creeping viscous flow and heat transfer can be solved for either a transient analysis or steady-state analysis. For transient analyses, either a control volume or a control mass approach can be used. Non-Newtonian fluids with viscosities which have thermal and spacial dependencies can be easily incorporated. All material parameters may be written as function statements by the user or simply specified as constants. A wide range of boundary conditions, both for the thermal analysis and the viscous flow analysis can be specified. For steady-state analyses, elastic strain rates can be included. Although this manual was specifically written for users interested in mantle convection, the code is equally well suited for analysis {{in a number of other}} areas including metal forming, <b>glacial</b> <b>flows,</b> and creep of rock and soil...|$|R
