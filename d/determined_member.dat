50|$|Only a few Scots, {{such as the}} Browning family, {{remained}} in Sarasota along with a <b>determined</b> <b>member</b> of the developer's family, John Hamilton Gillespie. He was a manager for Florida Mortgage & Investment Company, and began to develop Sarasota following the plan for the failed colony. In 1887, he built the De Sota Hotel which opened on February 25 hosting a large social event and celebration. Eventually, tourists arrived at a dock built on the bay. In May 1886 he completed a two-hole golf course. By 1905, he had completed a 110 acre nine-hole course.|$|E
40|$|The {{trends for}} {{analysis}} {{and design of}} steel frames are indicated in this dissertation. The current practice consists of applying the first-order elastic analysis with amplification factors or second-order elastic analysis {{in combination with the}} AISC-LRFD interaction equations. Determination of the effective length factors and individual member capacity checks are necessary to select adequate structural member sizes. The direct analysis method is a second-order elastic analysis approach that eliminates the determination of effective length factors from the current AlSC-LRFD method. Unsupported member length is used to calculate the axial strength of a member. Equivalent notional loads and/or modified stiffness are applied together with the external loads to account for the effects of initial out-of-plumbness and inelastic softening. For both AlSC-LRFD and direct analysis methods, a structure is analyzed as a whole, but the axial and flexural strength of each member is examined individually. Inelastic redistribution of internal forces in the structural system cannot be considered. As a result, <b>determined</b> <b>member</b> forces are not correct and more conservative member sizes will be obtained. Moreover, member-based approaches cannot predict structural behaviors such as failure mode and overstength factor. The advanced analysis method considered in this work is a second-order refined plastic hinge analysis in which both effective length factors and individual member capacity checks are not required. In addition, advanced analysis is a structure systembased analysis/design method that can overcome the difficulties of using member-based design approaches. Thus, advanced analysis is a state-of-the-art method for steel structure design. Several numerical examples are provided to show the design details of all three methods. The design requirements corresponding to each analysis approach are illustrated in these examples. The pros and cons of each method are discussed by comparing the design results. Advanced analysis is also a computer-based analysis and design procedure consistent with the features of performance-based design. Applying advanced analysis to performance-based fire resistance and seismic design are proposed. This dissertation shows advanced analysis is efficient in predicting the duration that structures could support load under elevated temperature and capable of determining the performance level of a structure subjected to seismic forces...|$|E
40|$|A last interglacial (Marine Isotope Stage, MIS 5 e) marine-coastal {{sequence}} {{has been}} identified along the Galilee coast of Israel, with the type section located at Rosh Hanikra (RH). The microtidal regime and tectonic stability, along with the detailed stratigraphy of the RH shore, make the study region ideally suited for determining relative sea level (RSL) through the MIS 5 e interval in the eastern Mediterranean. The sequence contains fossilized microtidal subunits at a few meters above the current sea level. Unfortunately, all fossils {{were found to be}} altered, so that U-Th datings cannot be considered to represent initial deposition. We contend that U-Th dating of Strombus bubonius shells (recrystallized to calcite) suffices to indicate a lower limit of ? 110 ± 8 ka for the time sea level dropped below the RH sedimentary sequence. The RH-section comprises three main subunits of a previously <b>determined</b> <b>member</b> (the Yasaf Member) : (a) a gravelly unit containing the diagnostic gastropod Strombus bubonius Lamarck (Persististrombus latus), which was deposited in the intertidal to super-tidal stormy zone; (b) Vermetidae reef domes indicating a shallow-water depositional environment; and (c) coarse to medium-sized, bioclastic sandstone, probably deposited in the shallow sub-tidal zone. The sequence overlies three abrasion platforms that are cut by tidal channels at elevations of + 0. 8 m, + 2. 6 m and + 3. 4 m, and which are filled with MIS 5 e sediments. We present a detailed study of the sequence, with emphasis on stratigraphic, sedimentological, and palaeontological characteristics that indicate sea-level changes. Although without precise absolute dating, the stratigraphic sequence of RH through MIS 5 e allows us to identify a time-series of RSL positions, using the elevations of three stratigraphic subunits. Reconstructed RSL values range from + 1. 0 m to + 7 m (with uncertainly < 1 m), and most fall within a narrow range of + 1. 0 to + 3. 3 m. Toward the end of MIS 5 e, RSL exceeded about + 7 m. Glacial isostatic adjustment (GIA) modelling using multiple ice histories suggests that GIA corrections range between about ? 1. 8 m and + 5. 4 m. This implies that global mean sea level resided between ? 0. 8 m and + 8. 7 m during most of MIS 5 e. The absolute GIA correction would not be constant through the interglacial, and reduces to a range of ? 1. 2 m to+ 2. 4 m {{towards the end of the}} interglacial...|$|E

40|$|The {{traditional}} {{notion of}} community is typically {{tied to a}} specific population or geographical location. Contemporary communities, however, are not necessarily limited by geographical boundaries. Over time, practices and communication patterns have changed and {{an increasing number of}} people are now using the internet to create and maintain their social networks. It is argued, within this thesis, that an important role of new technologies, such as the internet, is to enable a sense of community 'togetherness' to be maintained regardless of time and location. The convergence of internet technologies and social networks has also fuelled the popularity of online social networking sites such as Facebook (www. facebook. com) and Ning (www. ning. com). The sites provide opportunities for individuals to participate in a range of social groupings. Grounded in 'people to people interactions, the ‘online communities’ have the potential to provide support, friendship, information and a sense of belonging to each of the members. They may also be sources of social capital. It is argued, within this thesis, that the presence of social capital is intrinsically linked to positive outcomes across a range of areas, including improved health and greater wellbeing. However, while the value of maintaining a sense of social connectedness has been well documented, there has been little empirical research examining the determinants of success of online communities. This thesis seeks to address that omission by empirically testing a conceptual model that suggests both technical and social factors impact on the success of online communities. Data was collected from 202 members of the general population via an online survey. A Partial Least Squares (PLS) approach was used to examine the conceptual model. The results strongly supported the applicability of the model. The findings of the study suggest that a member’s sense of belonging within an online group is {{critical to the success of}} an online community. The research findings also indicate that individuals who have a sense of belonging within the online community are more likely to be satisfied with the community. Individuals who have a sense of belonging within the online community are also more likely to have a sense of loyalty towards the online community. As such, it is important for those managing online communities to take steps to encourage members to feel that they are a part of the community. There were also notable similarities and differences between the outcomes of this thesis and a study conducted by Lin (2008). Most notably, Lin (2008) held the view that system characteristics <b>determined</b> <b>member</b> satisfaction. The findings of this study, however, highlighted the dominant contribution of sense of belonging towards member satisfaction. Lin (2008) also assumed that member satisfaction influenced sense of belonging. The findings of this study found the reverse to be true. The hypothesised path between sense of belonging and member satisfaction was found to be positive and significant...|$|E
