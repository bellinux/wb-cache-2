30|$|In contrast, labor-using {{technological}} change (Scenario 2) causes a reduction <b>in</b> the poverty <b>headcount</b> by 3.47 percent. 2.91 percent {{points of the}} 3.74 percentage point <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> poverty <b>headcount</b> are due to the growth effect. This means that if inequality did not change, poverty would be reduced by 2.91 percent. Thus, redistribution was responsible for 0.56 percentage points of poverty reduction. These {{findings are consistent with}} earlier evidence that unskilled labor-intensive agricultural activities have higher poverty-reducing capacity compared to high-skilled, capital-intensive activities (de Janvry and Sadoulet [2010]; Loayza and Raddatz [2010]). Similarly, an improved agricultural resource base (Scenario 3) reduces poverty by 2.71 percent. The growth effect contributes to 1.76 percentage points in poverty changes while the income distribution effect contributes to 0.94 percentage point.|$|R

There was a significant <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> the <b>headcount</b> poverty ratio between 1992 / 93 and 1999 / 00 although more recently this trend has reversed.

40|$|The newly {{independent}} Republic of Moldova joined the World Bank and the IMF in 1992. The World Bank designated it a ?middle-income? country, a status it retained for Bretton Woods lending until 1997. The middle-income designation {{implied that the}} government of Moldova was not eligible for concessionary lending from the World Bank and IMF, and would not receive concessionary finance from the major bilateral development agencies. After demonstrating that assigning middle-income status to Moldova was a mistake, which was implicitly conceded by the World Bank in 1997, this Country Study investigates the consequences. It uses a simple procedure for calculating counterfactual scenarios based on assigning Moldova low-income status in the early 1990 s. The counterfactual scenarios suggest that the development and welfare costs of the mistake were extremely high: a much greater <b>fall</b> <b>in</b> income per capita than would otherwise have been the case, with an associated increase <b>in</b> <b>headcount</b> poverty and lower life expectancy. There is a cruel irony associated with this mistake. Had Moldova been designated a low-income country in the early 1990 s, it would have been by the mid- 2000 s a middle-income country instead of remaining the poorest country in Europe. Thus, there is a strong case for multilateral compensation. Moldova; Income; Human Development Costs; Poverty...|$|R

40|$|This paper explores {{trends in}} poverty and {{inequality}}, {{and the role of}} growth, inequality and sectoral changes in the evolution of poverty in Ethiopia between 1996 and 2005. We find that while poverty remains widespread, it declined markedly over this period. However, while inequality remained unchanged in rural areas, there was a substantial increase in urban inequality. In Ethiopia, income growth reduces poverty and increases in inequality increase poverty; the income-poverty elasticity lies in the range of - 1. 7 to - 2. 2. In rural Ethiopia, the increase in consumption has led to a reduction <b>in</b> <b>headcount</b> poverty. Growth also occurred in urban areas but the rise in inequality in urban areas wiped out the poverty-reducing effect that this growth might have otherwise provoked...|$|R

Some Japanese sources claim that the Ming army had up to 200,000 soldiers, which was nearly triple the number of the total men the Ming sources said they deployed in the entire Korean campaign. The Ming sources said they had a combined strength of 30,000 at the siege, yet the Japanese source most widely cited claimed 37,000 heads were taken. Korean sources said the allies lost about 7 to 8 thousand men. Western historians estimate that the Chinese army had 36,700 troops, and more than 30,000 Chinese and Korean were killed.|$|R
40|$|Estimates of the {{elasticity}} of headcount poverty {{with respect to}} income suggested in many influential studies appear too high and imply a more important role for income-growth in poverty-reduction than is appropriate. Direct estimates based on aggregate data for several different periods are much smaller at about - 1, which (in absolute terms) is no larger than one-half of those suggested in the literature. Researchers and policymakers are urged to use the lower estimate for any real-world application in a global or cross-country context. In such contexts, when per capita income increases by X percent during any period, decline <b>in</b> <b>headcount</b> poverty during the period {{should be expected to}} be of the order of X percent, and not, as most influential studies suggest, 2 X percent.

This indicates that the pro-poor impact of economic growth using mean consumption per capita as a proxy of economic growth during decentralisation (a reduction of around 5. 7 percentage points <b>in</b> the <b>headcount</b> poverty rate) has been offset to a greater extent by rising income inequality (up from 0. 329 in 2002 to 0. 380 in 2010) and by the stronger negative impact of inequality on regional poverty rates. In combination, the stronger negative impact of rising inequality has contributed to an increase of around 1. 9 percentage points <b>in</b> the <b>headcount</b> poverty rate...|$|R

The legal industry also {{has a number of}} interesting features which should make the study of mergers within it particularly relevant. Law firms enjoy a monopoly over the provision of legal services in the UK, they must be formed in partnerships and they can only practice law. These distinct features of the industry make it an interesting testing ground for assessing current theories about mergers especially in light of forthcoming legislation to deregulate the industry. This study focuses particularly on four aspects of mergers: the effect of mergers on profits; the conditions leading to mergers; differences in levels of profitability between merger partners; and changes <b>in</b> <b>headcount</b> following merger...|$|R
