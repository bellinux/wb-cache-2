Human smuggling differs from, but is sometimes associated with, human trafficking. A <b>human</b> <b>smuggler</b> will facilitate illegal entry into a country for a fee, but on arrival at their destination, the smuggled person is usually free. Trafficking involves a process of using physical force, fraud, or deception to obtain and transport people, usually {{for the purpose of}} forced labor or prostitution at the destination.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} paper takes {{departure from the}} contradictions of understandings regarding the purpose of operation EUNAVFOR Med, which operates in the Mediterranean aiming at disrupting the business model of <b>human</b> <b>smugglers.</b> The alteration of opinions concerns the question(s) regarding, {{to what extent the}} operation should be considered a securitization, and if so, of what? Research has consequently been drawn from the Copenhagen’s School theory of securitization, looking deeper into the involvement of the main actors in the operation, the EU, the <b>human</b> <b>smugglers</b> and the migrants, in order to identify if this operation could indeed be considered a securitization act. By placing the main actors of the operation {{in the center of the}} theoretical framework this research has been able to identify how this operation can be understood from a securitization theory and also what has been securitized. The methodological approach is based upon Norman Fairclough’s critical discourse analysis, framing both the structure and the analytical apparatus of the {{research paper}}, enabling an even broader understanding of the case. The result showed that there are indeed indicators demonstrating that operation EUNAVFOR Med could be considered a successful securitization of <b>human</b> <b>smugglers.</b> Also, in line with this operation, there are several indicators that shows how the EU has managed to pull a securitization move of migration, arguing that the migrants has formed an ‘uncontrolled problem’ for the EU. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the dissonance between {{official}} (governmental) and unofficial (migrant) narratives of ‘irregular’ migration journeys {{and the role of}} <b>human</b> <b>smugglers</b> in these journeys. The paper explores the planning of boat journeys by asylum seekers between Indonesia and Australia facilitated by <b>human</b> <b>smugglers</b> and the interventions of the Australian government. Refugee politics in the Asia-Pacific region {{has a long history of}} contradictions and tough approaches to asylum seekers and refugee populations. Perhaps surprisingly from the vantage point of North America and Europe, Australia has led the charge in punitive policies toward asylum seeker arrivals, accompanied by official narratives of fear, risk, invasion and contagion and a frenzied rhetoric of <b>human</b> <b>smugglers</b> as ‘the scum of the earth’. Indeed, Australia is alone among the nations who have signed and ratified the 1951 Refugee Convention in the detention of asylum seekers including children without time limits and without access to judicial review; a system of off-shore detention and processing centres; and the refusal to resettle asylum seekers once their protection claim has been substantiated. With this backdrop in mind, the paper draws on 150 interviews with Afghani and Iranian asylum seekers in Indonesia seeking to make onward journeys. The interviews were conducted in in 2014 in various locations around the Indonesian archipelago and designed to better understand and illuminate the decision-making of asylum seekers in relation to their migration journeys. The research identifies narratives of risk, security and protection seeking undertaken by individuals and families. Counter to the assumption of governments of the utility of official campaigns of deterrence in countries of origin and countries of transit such as Indonesia, this research finds that migrant decision-making is mostly informed though familial, community and ethnic group networks that also include those who assist in facilitating irregular migration journeys – the human smuggle...|$|R

40|$|The {{number of}} unaccompanied asylum-seeking {{children}} (UASC) has increased significantly in Sweden since {{the summer of}} 2006. Due to Sweden’s high rate of asylum application approvals, {{it has become a}} main destination country. Concurrently, unaccompanied asylum-seeking children have decreased in other more traditional European destination countries, such as Germany, the United Kingdom, Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway. The majority of the UASC come from Afghanistan and Somalia. There is insufficient knowledge regarding these children’s reasons and patterns for the migration to Sweden. This is a case study based on semi-structured interviews with key informants that have been strategically chosen for this study. The Migration System theory, which is based on key mechanisms of the globalization theory, is used in this study. Restricted asylum regulations in Western countries have created a “migratory industry” with <b>human</b> <b>smugglers,</b> which facilitate and expand the irregular migration. The migratory industry greatly influences the children’s choice of destination. Without the assistance of <b>human</b> <b>smugglers,</b> a migration would be impossible for these children. The conclusion of this study demonstrates the importance of informal social networks that are the reason behind the increase of UASC in Sweden. ...|$|R

40|$|Human {{smuggling}} is {{a phenomenon}} that further blurs the already fuzzy boundaries between economic migrant and refugee, legal and illegal immigrant. Many state policy-makers and NGOs are concerned that if they admit immigrants or refugees who use <b>human</b> <b>smugglers,</b> this will encourage smugglers to further break immigration laws. This paper questions the assumption that illegal migrants are like any other illegal commodity crossing state borders. Kyle argues that most migrant smugglers are social bandits who may be considered unsavory and even dangerous by their home societies, but not as "criminals. " Even states that are "victims" of <b>human</b> <b>smugglers</b> do not uniformly paint them as criminal and evil. In contrast to common thieves and smugglers, there is a highly politicized historical dimension to both the motivations of social bandits and to those who see them as either criminals (i. e., transnational organized crime) or "freedom fighters. " Although migration research has a significant {{role to play in}} the understanding of transnational social banditry, current migration theory does not sufficiently explain the sharp rise in human smuggling around the world, especially in terms of how it conceptualizes "demand. " To illustrate these points, special attention will be given to emigration from Ecuador to the United States and Spain, including the organization of illicit "migrant export schemes. ...|$|R
