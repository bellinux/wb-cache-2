50|$|A {{gear motor}} (external gear) {{consists}} of two gears, the driven gear (attached to the output shaft {{by way of a}} key, etc.) and the idler gear. High pressure oil is ported into one side of the gears, where it flows around the periphery of the gears, between the gear tips and the wall housings in which it resides, to the outlet port. The gears then mesh, not allowing the oil from the outlet side to flow back to the inlet side. For lubrication, the gear motor uses a small amount of oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated <b>drain</b> <b>port</b> on the motor housing. An especially positive attribute of the gear motor is that catastrophic breakdown is less common than in most other types of hydraulic motors. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the motor gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E

Initially, the effects of residence time (30, 60, 90, 120 and 180 min) and substrate release (rapid/non-rapid) from the <b>draining</b> <b>port</b> of Cellruptor on biosludges were investigated to find the optimum operating conditions of Cellruptor. Under these optimum operating conditions, the effect of Cellruptor pre-treatment on batch reactors of various substrates and semi-continuous digester of biosludge were investigated at mesophil biosludge, dewatered sludge, digested sludge, fibre sludge, hay, maize silage, minced meat, orange peel, seaweed and yeast. From the initial study, 90 min residence time and rapid release of pre-treated substrate from <b>draining</b> <b>port</b> were found to be optimum operating conditions of Cellruptor. From the batch experiments, Cellruptor pretreatment showed maximum and minimum increase of methane yield in hay (32 %) and dewatered sludge (2 %) respectively. The semi-continuous digester experimental results showed increase in biogas production by 22. 4 % from Cellruptor pre-treatment of biosludge at HRT of 15 days and OLR of 2. 0 g VS/L/day. With further studies, Cellruptor pre-treatment may be deployed in large-scale biogas plants to improve biogas yield...|$|R

5000|$|Gear pumps (with {{external}} teeth) (fixed displacement) {{are simple}} and economical pumps. The swept volume or displacement of gear pumps for hydraulics will be between about 1 and 200 millilitres. They {{have the lowest}} volumetric efficiency ( [...] ) of all three basic pump types (gear, vane and piston pumps) These pumps create pressure through the meshing of the gear teeth, which forces fluid around the gears to pressurize the outlet side. For lubrication, the gear pump uses {{a small amount of}} oil from the pressurized side of the gears, bleeds this through the (typically) hydrodynamic bearings, and vents the same oil either to the low pressure side of the gears, or through a dedicated <b>drain</b> <b>port</b> on the pump housing. Some gear pumps can be quite noisy, compared to other types, but modern gear pumps are highly reliable and much quieter than older models. This is in part due to designs incorporating split gears, helical gear teeth and higher precision/quality tooth profiles that mesh and unmesh more smoothly, reducing pressure ripple and related detrimental problems. Another positive attribute of the gear pump, is that catastrophic breakdown is a lot less common than in most other types of hydraulic pumps. This is because the gears gradually wear down the housing and/or main bushings, reducing the volumetric efficiency of the pump gradually until it is all but useless. This often happens long before wear causes the unit to seize or break down.|$|E

40|$|The invention, {{a static}} phase {{separator}} (SPS), uses airflow and capillary wetting characteristics to passively separate a two-phase (liquid and air) flow. The device accommodates highly variable liquid wetting characteristics. The resultant design {{allows for a}} range of wetting properties from about 0 to over 90 advancing contact angle, with frequent complete separation of liquid from gas observed when using appropriately scaled test conditions. Additionally, the design accommodates a range of air-to-liquid flow-rate ratios from only liquid flow to over 200 : 1 air-to-liquid flow rate. The SPS uses a helix input section with an ice-cream-cone-shaped constant area cross section (see figure). The wedge portion of the cross section is on {{the outer edge of the}} helix, and collects the liquid via centripetal acceleration. The helix then passes into an increasing cross-sectional area vane region. The liquid in the helix wedge is directed into the top of capillary wedges in the liquid containment section. The transition from diffuser to containment section includes a 90 change in capillary pumping direction, while maintaining inertial direction. This serves to impinge the liquid into the two off-center symmetrical vanes by the airflow. Rather than the airflow serving to shear liquid away from the capillary vanes, the design allows for further penetration of the liquid into the vanes by the air shear. This is also assisted by locating the air exit ports downstream of the liquid <b>drain</b> <b>port.</b> Additionally, any droplets not contained in the capillary vanes are re-entrained downstream by a third opposing capillary vane, which directs liquid back toward the liquid <b>drain</b> <b>port.</b> Finally, the dual air exit ports serve to slow the airflow down, and to reduce the likelihood of shear. The ports are stove-piped into the cavity to form an unfriendly capillary surface for a wetting fluid to carryover. The liquid <b>drain</b> <b>port</b> is located at the start of the containment region, allowing for draining the bulk fluid in a continuous circuit. The functional operation of the SPS involves introducing liquid flow (from a human body, a syringe, or other source) to the two-phase inlet while an air fan pulls on the air exit lines. The fan is operated until the liquid is fully introduced. The system is drained by negative pressure on the liquid drain lines when the SPS containment system is full...|$|E
40|$|Abdominal {{compartment}} syndrome (ACS) is consistently {{reported to have}} significant morbidity and mortality. Major burn patients who receive massive fluid resuscitation are at high-risk for this condition. Close monitoring of ACS is necessary for these patients. Prolonged unrelieved intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) at greater than 20 mmHg can produce significant morbidity and mortality. The most widely accepted and feasible way to measure IAP is via the <b>draining</b> <b>port</b> of a standard urinary catheter. Siriraj burn unit developed its own device from simple equipment {{that can be found}} easily in the hospital. It proved to be useful, cheap, and effective in monitoring intra-abdominal pressure.

40|$|The Nuclear Regulatory Commission {{is seeking}} public comment {{on a study}} of how a truck cask for {{transporting}} spent nuclear fuel might perform in a severe tunnel fire. The report models {{the performance of the}} NAC International Model LWT (NAC) spent fuel cask under the conditions of the April 1982 fire in the Caldecott highway tunnel near Oakland, Calif., when a gasoline tanker carrying 8, 800 gallons of gasoline overturned and caught fire. Severe, intense fires such as the Caldecott fire are extremely rare. However, they provide an opportunity to study how transportation packages might perform under very severe accident conditions. The results of this study strongly indicate that any radioactive release from the NAC model or a similar spent fuel shipping cask involved in a severe tunnel fire such as that of the Caldecott highway tunnel accident would be within regulatory limits. The peak internal temperatures predicted for the NAC cask in the analysis of the Caldecott fire scenario were not high enough to result in rupture of the fuel cladding (protective metal tubing around the fuel). Therefore, it would not be expected that any radioactive material (including spent nuclear fuel particles or fission products) would be released from the fuel rods.

Although many {{studies have examined the}} risk factors for anastomotic leak, large prospective series that report on long-term survival rates are lacking. Methods Data of 1576 patients who underwent primary resection and anastomosis for colorectal adenocarcinoma at a single institution from 1984 to 2004 were prospectively collected. Anastomotic leaks (LEK) were classified as radiological (RAD), local (LOC), or generalised (GEN). Logistic regression analysis of 21 variables was undertaken. Overall survival, cancer-related survival, and disease-free survival were analysed using the Kaplan-Meier method. Results Mean age of the patients was 67 years (SD = 12. 5) and 834 (52. 9 %) were male. An LEK was more likely when relatively major gynaecological (tubo-oophorectomy, P = 0. 004; hysterectomy, P = 0. 006) or urological (total cystectomy, P = 0. 014) procedures were performed during the same operative session. Other significant factors were anterior resection (P/ 0. 001), anastomosis using an intraluminal stapling device (P = 0. 005), abdominal <b>drain</b> via laparoscopic <b>port</b> (P = 0. 024), postoperative blood transfusion (P/ 0. 001), primary cancer site at the rectum (P = 0. 016), and TNM stage of T 2 or higher (P = 0. 026). Having an LEK showed significant impact on overall (P = 0. 021), cancer-related (P = 0. 006), and disease-free (P = 0. 001) survival.
