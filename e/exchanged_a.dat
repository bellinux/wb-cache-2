25|$|Astraea {{went ahead}} {{in pursuit of}} the first French frigate, {{which turned out to be}} Étoile. Astraea <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> {{broadside}} and then crossed Étoiles bow and raked her. At this moment a shot took away Astraeas wheel and killed both quartermasters, causing Astraea to lose direction and momentum. Now the situation reversed, with French guns nearly touching Astraeas taffrail. She received broadsides that tore away her lower rigging, scarred her deck and destroyed one of her carronades. However, she suffered no damage forward. Astrea was able to get starboard to starboard with her opponent. The two vessels exchanged broadsides at close range for two hours until Étoile sailed off. During the engagement a pistol shot hit Eveleigh below the heart, mortally wounding him. Sultane came up and also <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> broadside with Astraea. Astraea, much damaged, broke off the engagement as the two French frigates too sailed away. Creole had suffered ten men dead and 26 wounded; Astraea lost nine men dead and 37 wounded. That evening the two British ships anchored in Porto Praya on Santiago to effect repairs.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{completion}} of the Mishnah, when the prohibition or reluctance against writing halakhot had in great part disappeared, the responsa literature began to appear, traces being preserved in the Talmud.

25|$|As {{a theater}} director, Savage (under the name Keenan Hollohan, {{combining}} his middle name and his paternal grandmother's maiden name) was {{a founder of}} Seattle's Greek Active Theater. Much of the group's work were queer interpretations of classic works, such as a tragicomic Macbeth with both the title character and Lady Macbeth played by performers of the opposite sex.

Though her feeling for the people round was benevolent, intercourse with them she never sought; nor, with very few exceptions, ever experienced. And yet she knew them: knew their ways, their language, their family histories; she could hear of them with interest, and talk of them with detail, minute, graphic, and accurate; but WITH them, she rarely <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> word.|$|E

After Levant drew off for repairs, he {{concentrated}} fire on Cyane. During this time, out of her crew of 145 men and 26 boys, Cyane had six killed and 13 wounded. She also took on five feet of water in her hold and had so much damage to her masts and rigging that she became unmanageable and had to soon strike her colors.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1834, the Crows (maybe led by chief Arapooish) tried to shut down Fort McKenzie at the Missouri in Blackfeet country. The {{apparent}} motive was to stop the trading post's sale to their Indian enemies. Although later described as a month long siege of the fort, it lasted only two days. The opponents <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> few shots and {{the men in the}} fort fired a canon, but no real harm came to anyone. The Crows left four days before the arrival of a Blackfeet band. The episode seems to be the worst armed conflict between the Crows and a group of whites until the Sword Bearer uprising in 1887.|$|E

When the pace of Soviet deportations picked up in 1948, the grandmother was deported to Siberia for the second time and died in exile. Laima and Meilutė went into hiding, changing their names and obtaining fake papers. Meilutė graduated from Kaunas Medical Institute and became a pediatrician. The sisters reconnected with their parents in 1957 and <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> few letters. Raštikis died before seeing his daughters again.

Norris then exited the vehicle, opened the passenger-side sliding door, and leaned into the van, with his head and shoulders obscured from view behind the door. When Lucinda Schaefer passed the van, Norris <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> few words with her before dragging her into the van and closing the door. Using a ruse they would repeat in most of their subsequent murders, Bittaker turned the radio to full volume as Norris bound the victim's {{arms and legs and}} gagged her with duct tape as Bittaker drove Schaefer to the fire road in the San Gabriel Mountains where, in April, the pair had previously switched the locks.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} {{alleged that the}} IRA had a {{co-operative}} relationship with Basque militant group ETA since the early 1970s. In 1973 it was accused of providing explosives for the assassination of Luis Carrero Blanco in Madrid. In the 1970s, ETA also <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> quantity of handguns for training in explosives with the IRA. In addition, {{the leaders of the}} political wings of the respective Irish republican and Basque separatist movements have exchanged visits on several occasions to express solidarity with each other's cause. Prominent former IRA prisoners such as Brendan McFarlane and Brendan Hughes have campaigned for the release of ETA prisoners. In the mid-1990s after the IRA ceasefire, Basque media outlets followed the process carefully, sending a team to follow the families of those killed on Bloody Sunday as they campaigned for apology.|$|E
25|$|On 28 June, the {{squadron}} off Môle-Saint-Nicolas sighted two sails {{close to the}} Haitian shoreline and closed to investigate. These were revealed to be the French heavy 44-gun frigate Poursuivante under Captain Jean-Baptiste Philibert Willaumez and the 16-gun corvette Mignonne under Captain Jean-Pierre Bargeau. The French ships had sailed with a reduced armament from Les Cayes in southern Saint-Domingue on 26 June with orders to visit Môle-Saint-Nicolas before returning to France. On identifying the ships as French, the British squadron separated under orders from Bayntun, the senior captain. Captain Brisbane was instructed to chase Mignonne, Goliath rapidly closing {{the gap between the}} ships as they <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> few distant shot without effect. Mignonne was becalmed close inshore, and when it became apparent that his ship would be caught by the far larger Goliath, Captain Bargeau surrendered without either side having suffered any damage or casualties. Mignonne was later commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS Mignonne.|$|E

The houses are cleaned and {{decorated}} with kandeel (known as akashdivo in Konkani), lamps, mango leaves, and marigold flowers. The utensils are made to shine, filled with water, and decorated for the holy bath the following morning. On the eve of Naraka Charurdashi, paper-made effigies of Narakasura, filled with grass and firecrackers symbolizing evil, are made. These effigies are burnt at around four o'clock in the morning. Firecrackers are burst, and people return home to take a scented oil bath. Lamps are lit in a line. The women of the house perform aarti of the men, gifts are <b>exchanged,</b> <b>a</b> bitter berry called kareet is crushed under the feet in token of killing Narkasur, symbolising evil and removal of ignorance. Different varieties of poha and sweets are made and eaten with family and friends. Festivities continue until Tulsi Vivah and lamps are lit every evening. Celebrations include Lakshmi puja on the Diwali day, Krishna puja or Govardhan puja and cattle worship on Balipratipada day, Bhaubeej, and Tulsi vivah.|$|E
25|$|Dundas was a {{cautious}} commander, {{who refused to}} send his force of 1,200 British soldiers from a patchwork of regiments and 2,000 untested Corsican irregulars against a French garrison he estimated {{to be more than}} 4,000 strong. He insisted that any attack must wait until reinforcements arrived from Gibraltar. Hood was furious, accusing Dundas of failing to press the attack and appealing to Dundas' junior officers, Lieutenant Colonels Moore and William Villettes. This was an egregious breach of the chain of command and when Moore told Dundas of Hood's overtures the British general was so furious that he and Hood <b>exchanged</b> <b>a</b> series of increasingly angry letters before resigning his post on 11 March, passing command to Colonel Abraham D'Aubant. Hood was unaware of the strength of the French garrison, assuming it to be far lower, partially on the advice of Nelson. Nelson however was well aware of the true size of the French force, and apparently withheld the information from his command in the hope of ensuring a frontal assault on the town.|$|E
25|$|The agrarian reforms {{sparked a}} massive {{movement}} among the socii to demand full citizenship. It also provoked an intense {{debate within the}} Roman élite {{about the extent to}} which those demands should be met. But it appears from the fragmentary evidence that the conservative majority in the Roman Senate succeeded, by both fair means and foul, in blocking any significant expansion of citizenship among the socii in the period following the agrarian law of 133 BC. Gracchus himself, aware of the problems caused by his own reforms, promised the socii large-scale extension of Roman citizenship. But he was assassinated before he could deliver. In 95, the Roman Censors passed the Lex Licinia Mucia specifically to curb irregular acquisition of citizenship by wealthy allies (presumably by bribing Roman magistrates to enter their names on the citizen-rolls). The last straw for the socii was the assassination in 91 BC of another of their champions, the tribune of the plebs Marcus Livius Drusus. Drusus had specifically promised citizenship to all the allies, of all classes. His death sparked a series of conferences among the socii, at which mutual oaths of allegiance and hostages were <b>exchanged.</b> <b>A</b> league was formed to fight the Romans.|$|E
