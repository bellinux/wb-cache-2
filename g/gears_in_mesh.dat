40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{characteristics}} of static torsional mesh stiffness, load sharing ratio, and transmission errors of <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> with and without a localised tooth crack. Gearing is {{perhaps one of the}} most critical components in power transmission systems. The transmission error of <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> is considered to be one of the main causes of gear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmission error measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis. There still, however, remains to be developed a general non-linear Finite Element Model capable of predicting the effect of variations of gear torsional mesh stiffness, transmission error, transmitted load and load sharing ratio. The primary purpose of this study was to develop such a model and to study the behaviour of the static torsional mesh stiffness, load sharing ratio, and transmission error over one completed cycle of the tooth mesh. The research outlined in this thesis considers the variations of the whole gear body stiffness arising from the gear body rotation due to tooth bending deflection, shearing displacement, and contact deformation. Many different positions within the meshing cycle were investigated and then compared with the results of a gear mesh having a single cracked tooth. In order to handle contact problems with the finite element method, the stiffness relationship between the two contact areas must be established. Existing Finite Element codes rely on the use of the variational approach to formulate contact problems. This can be achieved by insertion of a contact element placed in between the two contacting areas where contact occurs. For modelling of gear teeth in mesh, the penalty parameter of the contact element is user-defined and it varies through the cyclic mesh. A simple strategy of how to overcome these difficulties is ++also presented. Most of the previously published finite element analysis with gears has involved only partial teeth models. In an investigation of gear transmission errors using contact elements, the whole body of the <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> must be modelled, because the penalty parameter of the contact elements must account for the flexibility of the entire body of the gear not just the local stiffness at the contact point...|$|E

Gearing is {{perhaps one of the}} most critical components in power transmission systems and the transmission error of <b>gears</b> <b>in</b> <b>mesh</b> is considered to be one of the main causes of gear noise and vibration. Numerous papers have been published on gear transmission error measurement and many investigations have been devoted to gear vibration analysis. There still, however, remains to be developed a general Finite Element Model capable of predicting the effect of variations in rigid body gear tooth position, in which the critical stage is the prediction of gear behaviour with profile modifications (including tip-relief). In this thesis, FEA results have been obtained by using various techniques including: (a) adaptive re-mesh with contacts using quad (2 D) and brick (3 D) elements and (b) the element birth and death option. Tooth profile modifications can affect the behaviour of the gear meshing including the T.

In the high order end, the elastic strains of the gear-shaft system have also been investigated. The results in this thesis have shown the potential for using strain-vibration relationships to monitor or control the transmission system.

This type of load is also considered {{as one of the}} main criteria on contributing the high stresses happen to the teeth that lead to the fatigue breakage after in some duration of cyclic loading time. This effort of study is made to analyze theoretical forces that create stresses with the effect of axial misalignment to a spur <b>gear</b> <b>in</b> <b>meshing</b> condition. A 3 D CAD model of the pinion hobbing gear tooth was created with Autodesk Inventor 2010 and analyzes using ANSYS V 13 FEA method. The transmitted dynamic load was calculated with change of misalignment angle proportionally to the theoretical contact area on the tooth face. As a result the stress distribution at the contact region and the tooth root is clearly seen variant with the misalignment angle and the equivalent stress is directly proportional with the misalignment deviation. The values of equivalent stresses and its distribution are change with the changing of deviation angle. The stress concentration is higher at the contact region and the tooth root with augmentation of misalignment angle. The face load factor in align and misalign shows the increasing of the load deviation will cause the factor to increase and probably the major contribution to the vibration of the <b>gear</b> <b>mesh</b> <b>in</b> dynamic condition...|$|R
