500|$|While {{still at}} Stanford, Simon's first job was a {{newspaper}} sports cartoonist for The San Francisco Chronicle and The San Francisco Examiner. After graduating, {{he worked as}} a television storyboard artist, and later a writer, at Filmation Studios. There he worked on several animated shows, including The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse and Heckle & Jeckle and Fat Albert and the Cosby Kids (1979). Simon recalls Filmation approving of his work because he was [...] "self-taught and unschooled," [...] but Simon felt the majority of what the studio produced was [...] "awful". On the suggestion of Filmation producer Lou Scheimer who was impressed by Simon's writing ability, Simon submitted a spec script for the series Taxi which was produced and aired in 1981 during its third season. Simon was hired as a writer, quickly becoming showrunner for its fifth and final season in 1983. Simon next worked as a writer and producer on Cheers from seasons one to three (1982–1985), writing five episodes: [...] "Endless Slumper", [...] "Battle of the Ex's", [...] "Fairytales Can Come True", [...] "Cheerio Cheers" [...] and [...] "The Bartender's Tale". Simon created, wrote and produced the short-lived sitcom Shaping Up in 1984, alongside Ken Estin; the show starred Leslie Nielsen as a <b>gym</b> <b>owner</b> and ran for five episodes on ABC. Simon also wrote and produced for Best of the West (1981), Barney Miller (1982) and It's Garry Shandling's Show (1987–1988), and wrote the 1991 film The Super.|$|E
