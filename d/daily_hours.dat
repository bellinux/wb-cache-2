25|$|The Roman Breviary (Latin: Breviarium Romanum) is {{the liturgical}} {{book of the}} Latin liturgical rites of the Catholic Church {{containing}} the public or canonical prayers, hymns, the Psalms, readings, and notations for everyday use, especially by bishops, priests, and deacons in the Divine Office (i.e., at the canonical hours or Liturgy of the Hours, the Christians' daily prayer). The word breviary, in general, refers to a collection of Christian orders of prayers and readings, such as contained in Anglican or Lutheran resources. It may {{also be used to}} refer to an abridged version of any text or a brief account or summary of some subject, but is primarily used to refer to a Christian liturgical book. The volume containing the <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of Roman Catholic prayer was published as the Breviarium Romanum (Roman Breviary) until the reforms of Paul VI, when it became known as the Liturgy of the Hours. However, these terms are used interchangeably to refer to the Office in all its forms. This entry deals with the Roman Breviary prior to the changes introduced by Pope Paul VI in 1974.|$|E
25|$|The Daintree River Ferry is a cable ferry {{across the}} Daintree River in Cape Tribulation. The ferry {{is the only}} cable ferry {{operating}} within tropical Australia and its <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of operation are between 06:00 and midnight. In July 2003, the Shire of Douglas overturned a motion to investigate {{the construction of a}} low-lying single lane bridge with a boom gate and a second ferry across the Daintree. Residents feared a bridge would threaten the rainforest due to a potential increase in traffic. Where as tourist operators stated a bridge would have boosted the local economy. Over the 2011 Easter long weekend, during a period when the ferry was free, tourists using the ferry dramatically increased and resorts were booked out. After Easter local tourism operators expressed a desire for the ferry to be free year-round but their suggestion was ignored. As of 1 July 2011, the cost of a return ticket for private use motor cars and utilities was $22. Limited annual quantities of Daintree ferry concessional travel policy applies to the following people: Cairns Regional Council ratepayers, residents, business operators and employees who work north of the Daintree River and are within the former Douglas Shire area; Queensland Health or Blue Care who travel across the Daintree Ferry {{in the course of their}} duties; and Residents of the Wujal Wujal Aboriginal Shire and some Cook Shire Council residents.|$|E

500|$|Gordon {{decided that}} to make [...] "time travel in an X-Files way", the best way was with [...] "a guy {{that turns out to}} be you". He {{therefore}} added the plot about a regretful scientist trying to stop developments from ever occurring. The scientist's character was inspired by a story Gordon heard about Manhattan Project physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer berating Harry S. Truman on the 1945 atomic bombings of Japan, and the writer wondered [...] "What if Oppenheimer could go back to the past and 'uninvent' the bomb?". Eventually Gordon and Greenwalt found another philosophical question that becomes Jason's motivation to halt his own research—"Life itself is about the unknown and discovering what is in front of us. But if everyone, or maybe some people, knew what would happen, that would create a new set of horrors, and it would need to be stopped". The script took over a week of writing, with sessions of 15 <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> and the contributions of John Shiban, Frank Spotnitz and Ken Horton. Gordon was still reworking the teleplay the weekend before shooting began in Vancouver, including the removal of two [...] "useless characters" [...] that included a Stephen Hawking-inspired scientist in a wheelchair. David Duchovny declared that a few scenes were created during production [...] "because no one could know if the audience understood what was happening".|$|E
2500|$|The regular {{community}} members are known (though only for official reasons) as Workers, {{and they have}} the flexible option of changing their field and location of employment every single day, so as not to grow bored or stagnant during the week with their four-on-average <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of work. Available work often includes the necessary physical labor that goes into maintaining a community, such as basic building or repairing projects, cleaning duties, or agricultural work. Labor in Walden Two operates using a simple point system of units called [...] "credits," [...] in which more menial or unpleasant jobs (such as waste management) earn a Worker a higher number of credits than more relaxing or interesting jobs, ultimately allowing more free time for that Worker.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aeration}} method accrues to {{the bakery}} three production economies: material savings, time savings, and labour savings. As {{an illustration of}} the first of these economies, Dauglish estimated that, by eliminating the decomposition of the starches and gluten that occur from traditional fermentation (a loss equal to between three and six percent), this had a value {{in the middle of the}} 19th century of [...] "£5,000,000 in the total quantity of bread made, annually, in the United Kingdom" [...] (£ in current terms). The process is a highly automated one, and thus saves time and reduces labour costs. Whereas the traditional dough fermentation method required between eight and ten hours to ready a batch of dough for baking, the Dauglish method has dough ready for the ovens in approximately half an hour. And since the bread dough is ready for the ovens so quickly, the <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> worked can be reduced, obviating the need for the night shifts that were so prevalent in the baking industry at the time. Finally, the lack of most additives to enhance the fermentation process reduces the cost of factor inputs while also producing a virtually unadulterated product.|$|E

2500|$|In 1941, Anderson {{moved to}} Gautier, Mississippi, {{to live on}} his wife's father's estate (Oldfields) with his family. An {{extraordinarily}} productive period followed. Freed from {{his work at the}} Pottery, he had time to draw, paint and make block prints; to illustrate some of his favorite books; to experiment with theories of dynamic symmetry and with the drawing methods of the Mexican artist and educator Adolfo Best Maugard; and to translate from Spanish part of Jose Pijoan's history of art (probably without realizing that the work had already been translated into English). [...] He also built his own kiln and fired a new series of figurines, kept the house stocked with firewood, built a rental cottage, wrote short stories and aphorisms, went on marvelous adventures with his children, and celebrated the passing of the seasons and <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> in a series of watercolors and lyrical [...] "calendar drawings" [...] that capture the life around him. He put on puppet shows, depicted farm life in a series of large watercolors, and, using surplus linoleum and wallpaper, made huge linoleum blocks depicting the natural world and that of fairy tales. Some of these were 30' in length, the largest art prints ever produced by an American, predating those of Leonard Baskin and others, and when they were exhibited in 1949 at the Brooklyn Museum, the Museum's curator of prints, Una E. Johnson, said that she had “never seen block prints so finely executed and of such great dimension.” The fairy-tale linocuts were an attempt, Anderson said, to produce a series of imaginative “explosions” more powerful than the threat of the atomic bomb: explosions “so identified with the life of man that they stimulate, without destroying, life.” ...|$|E
60|$|But {{when all}} is said about the horror of idleness the broad fact remains that the hours of work are too long. If we could in {{imagination}} disregard for a moment all question of how the hours of work are to be shortened and how production is to be maintained and ask only what would be the ideal number of the <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of compulsory work, for character's sake, few of us would put them at more than four or five. Many of us, as applied to ourselves, at least, would take a chance on character at two.|$|E

Arsenio being his only compatriot at Condillac it was not wonderful that in his few <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of relief from his gaoler's duty [...] "Battista" [...] should seek out the fellow and sit in talk with him. The pair became intimate, and intercourse between them grew more free and unrestrained. Garnache waited, wishing to risk nothing by precipitancy, and watched for his opportunity. It came on the morrow of All Saints. On that Day of the Dead, Arsenio, whose rearing had been that of a true son of Mother Church, was stirred {{by the memory of}} his earthly mother, who had died some three years before. He was silent and moody, and showed little responsiveness to Garnache's jesting humour. Garnache, wondering what might be toward in the fellow's mind, watched him closely.|$|E

6000|$|As {{the astronomers}} {{tell us that}} it is {{probable}} that there are in the universe innumerable solar systems besides ours, to each of which myriads of utterly unknown and unseen stars belong, so it is certain that every man, however obscure, however far removed from the general recognition, is {{one of a group of}} men impressible for good, and impressible for evil, and that it is in the eternal nature of things that he cannot really improve himself without in some degree improving other men. And observe, this is especially the case when he has improved himself in the teeth of adverse circumstances, as in a maturity succeeding to a neglected or an ill-taught youth, in the few <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> remaining to him after ten or twelve hours' labour, in the few pauses and intervals of a life of toil; for then his fellows and companions have assurance that he can have known no favouring conditions, and that they can do what he has done, in wresting some enlightenment and self-respect from what Lord Lytton finely calls - ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{doubtful}} if John understood the drift of Felix's exordium, it {{is doubtful}} if he had quite listened--he having so much to not listen to at the Home Office that the practice was growing on him. A vested interest to John was a vested interest, culture was culture, and security was certainly security--none of them were symbols of age. Further, the social question--at least {{so far as it}} had to do with outbreaks of youth and enthusiasm--was too familiar to him to have any general significance whatever. What with women, labor people, and the rest of it, he had no time for philosophy--a dubious process at the best. A man who had to get through so many <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of real work did not dissipate his energy in speculation. But, though he had not listened to Felix's remarks, they had ruffled him. There is no philosophy quite so irritating as that of a brother! True, no doubt, that the country was in a bad way, but as to vested interests and security, that was all nonsense! The guilty causes were free thought and industrialism.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{dark room}} at that hour of six in the evening, when just the single oil reading-lamp under its green shade let fall a dapple of light over the Turkey carpet; over the covers of books {{taken out of the}} bookshelves, and the open pages of the one selected; over the deep blue and gold of the coffee service on the little old stool with its Oriental embroidery. Very dark in the winter, with drawn curtains, many rows of leather-bound volumes, oak-panelled walls and ceiling. So large, too, that the lighted spot before the fire where he sat was just an oasis. But that was what Keith Darrant liked, after his day's work--the hard early morning study of his [...] "cases," [...] the fret and strain of the day in court; it was his rest, these two hours before dinner, with books, coffee, a pipe, and {{sometimes}} a nap. In red Turkish slippers and his old brown velvet coat, he was well suited to that framing of glow and darkness. A painter would have seized avidly on his clear-cut, yellowish face, with its black eyebrows twisting up over eyes--grey or brown, one could hardly tell, and its dark grizzling hair still plentiful, in spite of those <b>daily</b> <b>hours</b> of wig. He seldom thought of his work while he sat there, throwing off with practised ease the strain of that long attention to the multiple threads of argument and evidence to be disentangled--work profoundly interesting, as a rule, to his clear intellect, trained to almost instinctive rejection of all but the essential, to selection of what was legally vital out of the mass of confused tactical and human detail presented to his scrutiny; yet sometimes tedious and wearing. As for instance to-day, when he had suspected his client of perjury, and was almost convinced that he must throw up his brief. He had disliked the weak-looking, white-faced fellow from the first, and his nervous, shifty answers, his prominent startled eyes--a type too common in these days of canting tolerations and weak humanitarianism; no good, no good! ...|$|E
