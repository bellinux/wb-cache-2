50|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> {{feeds on}} small crustaceans, worms, molluscs, insect larvae, insects and small fish.|$|E
50|$|The Banska River is {{inhabited}} {{by a large}} number of fish species, including the Mullet, <b>Danube</b> <b>Bleak,</b> the Carassius and the Common Nase.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> or Caspian shemaya (Alburnus chalcoides) is {{a species}} of {{freshwater}} fish in the family Cyprinidae. It is found in Iran, Austria, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Romania, Russia, Serbia, Slovenia, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan.|$|E
50|$|Male <b>Danube</b> <b>bleaks</b> {{assemble}} in May to July at spawning {{sites in}} fast flowing streams with gravel bottoms. The females arrive later and deposit about twenty thousand eggs which stick to stones and gravel. These hatch after {{two or three}} days and the larvae stay among the gravel for another ten days before moving to backwaters and shallows where they feed on zooplankton, insect larvae and algae. The juvenile fish migrate down stream in the autumn or the spring of the following year. They may become mature in four to five years.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> {{occurs in}} slow flowing {{stretches}} of rivers {{flowing into the}} Black Sea and the Caspian Sea and in the Aral Sea basin. It is a migratory fish, spawning in {{the headwaters of the}} rivers and then moving down to the lower parts, estuaries and brackish areas of sea. These migratory patterns have been disrupted by the building of dams across many of the rivers. Landlocked populations survive in small rivers and reservoirs, breeding in the small streams above the dams. The main Caspian Sea population has found ways of spawning below the dams. Overfishing and pollution in the Caspian Sea could impact on the <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> but in 2008 the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species listed it as being of [...] "Least concern".|$|E
50|$|The {{reservoir}} {{is rich in}} fish. It is {{stocked with}} perch, trout (rainbow, brown, brook), carp, European chub, common rudd, common roach, pumpkinseed, wels catfish, <b>Danube</b> <b>Bleak</b> and various members of Carassius. Trout are reared in cages within the reservoir. Most types of fishing are practiced: spinning with lures, fly fishing, and others.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> is an {{elongate}} slim fish {{which can}} reach 40 cm {{but a more}} normal size is 15 to 30 centimetres (6 to 12 in). There are 57 to 70 scales along the lateral line. The abdomen is compressed into a keel and the posterior end of this has no scales. The dorsal fin has eight to nine branched rays while the anal fin has fifteen to nineteen. This fish is morphologically quite variable which {{may be due to}} local adaptations to various habitats but {{is more likely to be}} due to several species being involved.|$|E
40|$|<b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> and sabrefish were {{important}} commercial fish species before catastrophic {{changes in the}} Aral Sea. Measures undertaken by Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan {{since the end of}} XX-th century allowed improving the environment state here. Hence, investigation of the modern state of these fish populations was a goal of our investigations of fishes in the Syr Darya River in the borders of the Republic of Kazakhstan. Data were collected since 2007 from the Shardara water reservoir to the estuary in the Small Aral Sea. Now both species are ones of the most common species along the investigated part of the River. Environmental conditions are sufficient for their reproduction. By the known data of the XX-th century <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> did not inhabit the middle reach of the Syr Darya River, but now it is usual here. <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> was found in some tributaries of the Syr Darya River too, but sabrefish was not. Variation of many of measurements and counts for the population of <b>Danube</b> <b>bleak</b> remains in the same limits as in the past. Two forms of gill rakers were revealed. The maximal length and weight become smaller. The condition factor and grow rate are good. Some changes in body shape were revealed in the sabrefish population. The condition factor and grow rate became worse then earlier. Generally, the revealed differences in the state of two indigenous fish species can point to ecosystem changes in the investigated part of the Syr Darya River...|$|E
