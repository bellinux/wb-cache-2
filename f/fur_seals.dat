5|$|Interspecific {{predation}} among pinnipeds does occur. The {{leopard seal}} {{is known to}} prey on numerous other species, especially the crabeater seal. Leopard seals typically target crabeater pups, which form {{an important part of}} their diet from November to January. Older crabeater seals commonly bear scars from failed leopard seal attacks; a 1977 study found that 75% of a sample of 85 individual crabeaters had these scars. Walruses, despite being specialized for feeding on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, occasionally prey on Arctic seals. They kill their prey with their long tusks and eat their blubber and skin. Steller sea lions have been recorded eating the pups of harbor seals, northern <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and California sea lions. New Zealand sea lions feed on pups of some fur seal species, and the South American sea lion may prey on South American <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Pinnipeds {{are also}} {{threatened}} by humans indirectly. They are unintentionally caught in fishing nets by commercial fisheries and accidentally swallow fishing hooks. Gillnetting and Seine netting {{is a significant}} cause of mortality in seals and other marine mammals. Species commonly entangled include California sea lions, Hawaiian monk seals, northern <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and brown <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> Pinnipeds are also affected by marine pollution. High levels of organic chemicals accumulate in these animals since they are {{near the top of}} food chains and have large reserves of blubber. Lactating mothers can pass the toxins on to their young. These pollutants can cause gastrointestinal cancers, decreased reproductivity and greater vulnerability to infectious diseases. Other man-made threats include habitat destruction by oil and gas exploitation, encroachment by boats, and underwater noise.|$|E
50|$|The brown <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus pusillus), {{also known}} as the Cape <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> South African <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> and the Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is a species of <b>fur</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{northern}} <b>fur</b> <b>seal's</b> range overlaps {{almost exactly}} {{with that of}} Steller sea lions; occasional cohabitation occurs at reproductive rookeries, notably in the Kurils, the Commander Islands, and Tyulen'i Islands. The only other <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> found in the Northern Hemisphere is the Guadalupe <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> which overlaps slightly with the northern <b>fur</b> <b>seal's</b> range in California.|$|R
25|$|In November 2005, a male New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Kaioko, {{arrives at}} Auckland Zoo, he is later {{joined by a}} female New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Moana, in June 2006 and a male Sub Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Orua, in August 2007.|$|R
5|$|Returning to New York on 13 June 1892, Concord {{made another}} cruise to the West Indies late that year, and arrived back at Norfolk, Virginia, on 5 December. She participated in International Naval Review held at Norfolk and New York in March and April 1893, and in June sailed from Norfolk for the Far East, calling at the Azores, Gibraltar, Malta, Port Said, Bangkok, and Saigon before {{arriving}} at Hong Kong on 30 October. She cruised on the Asiatic Station until 29 May 1894 {{when she arrived}} at Unalaska. She cruised on sealing patrol in the North Pacific {{to carry out the}} provisions of the treaty between the United States and United Kingdom, which empowered Concord to seize any vessel violating the laws protecting valuable <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> She gathered hydrographic information to correct Bering Sea charts and conduct scientific observations of the <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b>|$|E
5|$|Some {{species have}} become so {{numerous}} that they conflict with local people. In the United States, pinnipeds are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act of 1972 (MMPA). Since that year, California sea lion populations have risen to 250,000. These animals began exploiting more man-made environments, like docks, for haul-out sites. Many docks are not designed to withstand the weight of several resting sea lions. Wildlife managers have used various methods to control the animals, and some city officials have redesigned docks so they can better withstand use by sea lions. Sea lions also conflict with fisherman since both depend on the same fish stocks. In 2007, MMPA was amended to permit the lethal removal of sea lions from salmon runs at Bonneville Dam. The 2007 law seeks to relieve pressure on the crashing Pacific Northwest salmon populations. Wildlife officials have unsuccessfully attempted {{to ward off the}} sea lions using bombs, rubber bullets and bean bags. Efforts to chase sea lions away from the area have also proven ineffective. Critics like the Humane Society object to the killing of the sea lions, claiming that hydroelectric dams pose a greater threat to the salmon. Similar conflicts have existed in South Africa with brown <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> In the 1980s and 1990s, South African politicians and fisherman demanded that the <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> be culled, believing that the animals competed with commercial fisheries. Scientific studies found that culling <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> would actually {{have a negative effect on}} the fishing industry, and the culling option was dropped in 1993.|$|E
5|$|The Inuit of the Thule culture—whose {{descendants}} {{form the}} majority of the current population—arrived nearly a thousand years ago, with the first arrivals dated to approximately 13th and 14th century. The Thule people were more technologically advanced than their Dorset predecessors, although they still relied on subsistence hunting, with walruses, reindeer, and particularly the <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> constituting the base of the economy in the early period.|$|E
5000|$|Arctocephalus forsteri, the Australasian <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> South Australian <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Antipodean <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> or long-nosed <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> is {{a species}} of <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> found around the south coast of Australia, {{the coast of the}} South Island of New Zealand, and some of the small islands to the south and east of there. While male-only colonies were also located on the Cook Strait coast of the North Island near Wellington [...] there are also {{breeding}} colonies in the North Island. A large accessible breeding colony is located at Cape Palliser, on the south-easternmost tip of the North Island and vagrants are found as far north as New Caledonia. The name New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> is used by English speakers in New Zealand (kekeno is used in the Māori language), and southern <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> by speakers in Australia. As of 2014, the common name long-nosed <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> has been proposed for the population of seals inhabiting Australia. [...] Although the Australian and New Zealand populations show some genetic differences, their morphologies are very similar, and thus they remain classed as a single species.|$|R

5000|$|There are no {{native land}} mammals, nor {{amphibians}} or reptiles. Marine mammals include five breeding species of seal; the southern elephant <b>seal,</b> Australasian <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal,</b> Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> and the rare New Zealand sea lion, 95% of the world's population of which breed on the Auckland Islands.|$|R
5|$|A rugged, sparsely {{populated}} area, the Catlins features a scenic coastal landscape and dense temperate rainforest, {{both of which}} harbour many endangered species of birds, most notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin. The coast attracts numerous marine mammals, among them New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and Hooker's sea lions. In general terms the area enjoys a maritime temperate climate. Its exposed location leads to its frequently wild weather and heavy ocean swells, which are an attraction to big-wave surfers, and have also caused numerous shipwrecks.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species of}} marine animals exist and rely, {{directly}} or indirectly, on the phytoplankton. Antarctic sea life includes penguins, blue whales, orcas, colossal squids and <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> The emperor penguin {{is the only}} penguin that breeds during the winter in Antarctica, while the Adélie penguin breeds farther south than any other penguin. The southern rockhopper penguin has distinctive feathers around the eyes, giving the appearance of elaborate eyelashes. King penguins, chinstrap penguins, and gentoo penguins also breed in the Antarctic.|$|E
5|$|The Catlins coast often hosts New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and Hooker's sea lions, and {{occasionally}} southern elephant seals can be seen. Several species of penguin also nest along the coast, notably the rare yellow-eyed penguin (hoiho), as do other seabirds including mollymawks and Australasian gannets, and the estuaries of the rivers {{are home to}} herons, stilts, godwits and oystercatchers. Bitterns and the threatened fernbird (matata) can also occasionally be seen along the reedy riverbanks.|$|E

5|$|They harass smaller raptors such as swamp harriers, {{whistling}} kites, brahminy kites and ospreys, {{forcing them}} to drop any food that they are carrying. Other birds victimised include silver and Pacific gulls, cormorants and Australasian gannets. There is one record of a white-bellied sea eagle seizing a gannet when unsuccessful in obtaining its prey. They may even steal food from their own species, including their mates. The white-bellied sea eagle attacks these birds by striking them with outstretched talons from above or by flying upside down underneath the smaller predator and snatching the prey, all the while screeching shrilly. Southern <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> have also been targeted for their fish.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, {{sea otter}} populations became so depleted, {{commercial}} hunting {{was no longer}} viable. It had stopped the Aleutian Islands, by 1808, as a conservation measure imposed by the Russian-American Company. Further restrictions were ordered by the Company in 1834. When Russia sold Alaska to the United States in 1867, the Alaska population had recovered to over 100,000, but Americans resumed hunting and quickly extirpated the sea otter again. Prices rose as the species became rare. During the 1880s, a pelt brought $105 to $165 in the London market, but by 1903, a pelt could be {{worth as much as}} $1,125. In 1911, Russia, Japan, Great Britain (for Canada) and the United States signed the Treaty for the Preservation and Protection of <b>Fur</b> <b>Seals,</b> imposing a moratorium on the harvesting of sea otters. So few remained, perhaps only 1,000–2,000 individuals in the wild, that many believed the species would become extinct.|$|E
5|$|Other {{indigenous}} {{animals are}} represented by reptiles (tuatara, skinks and geckos), frogs, spiders, insects (weta) and snails. Some, such as the tuatara, are so unique {{that they have been}} called living fossils. Three species of bats (one since extinct) were the only sign of native land mammals in New Zealand until the 2006 discovery of bones from a unique, mouse-sized land mammal at least 16 million years old. Marine mammals however are abundant, with almost half the world's cetaceans (whales, dolphins, and porpoises) and large numbers of <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> reported in New Zealand waters. Many seabirds breed in New Zealand, a third of them unique to the country. More penguin species are found in New Zealand than in any other country.|$|E
50|$|Despite {{confusion}} {{stemming from}} its common name, the New Zealand <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> (Arctocephalus forsteri) is a pinniped native to South Australia. Efforts {{to overcome this}} confusion have led to increasing use of the common name, long-nosed <b>fur</b> <b>seal.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Fur</b> <b>Seal</b> Point, {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>Fur</b> <b>Seal</b> Beach, is a cape midway along the eastern coast of Clarence Island, the easternmost of the South Shetland Islands of Antarctica. Just off the headland lies the small Sugarloaf Island.|$|R
40|$|An {{immature}} Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> was sighted on Unguja Island, Zanzibar, Tanzania, in 2008. This is {{the most}} northerly record of a vagrant of this species. The nearest breeding colony is on the Prince Edward Islands, 4500 km distant. While {{it is likely that}} this is the natal site of the vagrant due to its proximity and population size, the actual location of origin is unknown. This is the second <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> sighted in this area. A <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> of unknown species was sighted on Pemba Island, 30 km north of the Unguja Island, in 2002. While the species of the latter animal could not be determined, it is likely also a Subantarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seal...</b>|$|R
5|$|Several {{species of}} {{pinniped}} {{continue to be}} harvested. The Convention for the Conservation of Antarctic Seals allows limited hunting of crabeater seals, leopard seals and Weddell seals. However, Weddell seal hunting is prohibited between September and February if the animal is over one year of age, to ensure breeding stocks are healthy. Other species protected are southern elephant seals, Ross seals and Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals.</b> The Government of Canada permits the hunting of harp seals. This has been met with controversy and debate. Proponents of seal hunts insist that the animals are killed humanely and the white-coated pups are not taken, while opponents {{argue that it is}} irresponsible to kill harp seals as they are already threatened by declining habitat.|$|E
5|$|Virtually {{every type}} of medium to large-sized oceanic animal sharing the habitat of the cookiecutter shark is open to attack: bite scars have been found on {{cetaceans}} (including porpoises, dolphins, beaked whales, sperm whales, and baleen whales), pinnipeds (including <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> leopard seals, and elephant seals), dugongs, sharks (including blue sharks, goblin sharks, basking sharks, great white sharks, megamouth sharks and smalltooth sand tiger sharks), stingrays (including deepwater stingrays, pelagic stingrays and sixgill stingrays), and bony fishes (including billfishes, tunas, dolphinfishes, jacks, escolars, opahs, and pomfrets). The cookiecutter shark also regularly hunts and eats entire squid with a mantle length of , comparable in size to the shark itself, as well as bristlemouths, copepods, and other prey of more modest dimensions.|$|E
5|$|Commercial sealing was {{historically}} just {{as important}} an industry as whaling. Exploited species included harp seals, hooded seals, Caspian seals, elephant seals, walruses and all species of fur seal. The scale of seal harvesting decreased substantially after the 1960s, after the Canadian government reduced {{the length of the}} hunting season and implemented measures to protect adult females. Several species that were commercially exploited have rebounded in numbers; for example, Antarctic <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> may be as numerous as they were prior to harvesting. The northern elephant seal was hunted to near extinction in the late 19th century, with only a small population remaining on Guadalupe Island. It has since recolonized much of its historic range, but has a population bottleneck. Conversely, the Mediterranean monk seal was extirpated from much of its former range, which stretched from the Mediterranean to the Black Sea and northwest Africa, and only remains in the northeastern Mediterranean and some parts of northwest Africa.|$|E
50|$|On May 21, 2011, the black-footed penguin exhibit (formerly the South African cape <b>fur</b> <b>seal</b> exhibit) {{opened to}} the public.

5|$|Lek {{systems are}} known to exist among some populations of walruses. These males cluster around females and try to attract them with {{elaborate}} courtship displays and vocalizations. Lekking may also exist among California sea lions, South American <b>fur</b> <b>seals,</b> New Zealand sea lions and harbor seals. In some species, including elephant seals and grey seals, males will try to lay claim to the desired females and defend them from rivals. Elephant seal males establish dominance hierarchies with the highest ranking males—the alpha males—maintaining harems {{of as many as}} 30–100 females. These males commonly disrupt the copulations of their subordinates while they themselves can mount without inference. They will, however, break off mating to chase off a rival. Grey seal males usually claim a location among a cluster of females whose members may change over time. Male harp seals, crabeater seals and hooded seals follow and defend lactating females in their vicinity—usually one or two at a time,—and wait for them to reach estrus.|$|E
5|$|The primary food of Galapagos {{sharks are}} benthic bony fishes (including eels, sea bass, flatfish, flatheads, and triggerfish) and octopuses. They also {{occasionally}} take surface-dwelling prey such as mackerel, flyingfish, and squid. As the sharks grow larger, they consume {{increasing numbers of}} elasmobranchs (rays and smaller sharks, including of their own species) and crustaceans, as well as indigestible items such as leaves, coral, rocks, and garbage. At the Galapagos Islands, this species has been observed attacking Galapagos <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> (Arctocephalus galapagoensis) and sea lions (Zalophus wollebaeki), and marine iguanas (Amblyrhynchus cristatus). While collecting fishes at Clipperton Island, Limbaugh (1963) noted that juvenile Galapagos sharks surrounded the boat, with multiple individuals rushing at virtually anything trailing {{in the water and}} striking the boat bottom, oars, and marker buoys. The sharks were not slowed by rotenone (a fish toxin) or shark repellent, and some followed the boat into water so shallow that their backs were exposed.|$|E
5|$|Aquatic mammals {{are also}} present in the bay. Before 1825, Spanish, French, English, Russians and Americans were drawn to the Bay Area to harvest prodigious {{quantities}} of beaver, river otter, marten, fisher, mink, fox, weasel, harbor and <b>fur</b> <b>seals</b> and sea otter. This early fur trade, known as the California Fur Rush, was {{more than any other}} single factor, responsible for opening up the West and the San Francisco Bay Area, in particular, to world trade. By 1817 sea otter in the area were practically eliminated. Since then, the California golden beaver has re-established a presence in the Alhambra Creek. The North American river otter which was first reported in Redwood Creek at Muir Beach in 1996, has since been spotted in the North Bay's Corte Madera Creek, the South Bay's Coyote Creek, as well as in 2010 in San Francisco Bay itself at the Richmond Marina. Other mammals include the internationally famous sea lions who began inhabiting San Francisco's Pier 39 after the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake and the locally famous Humphrey the Whale, a humpback whale who entered San Francisco Bay twice on errant migrations in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Bottlenose dolphins and harbor porpoises have recently returned to the bay, having been absent for many decades. Historically, this was the northern extent of their warm-water species range.|$|E
