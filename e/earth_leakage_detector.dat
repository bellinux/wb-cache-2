40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} a Carbon Monoxide (CO) gas <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> in vehicles. The number of sudden death incidents due to excessive CO inhalation has recently increased. Many cases are due to driver habits and awareness, for instance, air conditioning switches remain on while they are sleeping in the car. This habit is not a good practice because if there were gas leakage into the cabin, especially CO, the situation could result in sudden death. Basically the driver feels sleepy when excessive CO concentrations occur in the cabin. Based on that, a vehicle gas <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> system has been developed using a gas sensor and logic detector circuit. Subsequently, the signal from the sensor is fed to an 8 -bit PIC 16 F 84 microcontroller on-board system via appropriate interfacing devices, which will run on pre-programmed instructions.

40|$|A new {{approach}} to gas leakage detection in high pressure distribution networks is proposed, where two <b>leakage</b> <b>detectors</b> are modelled as a linear parameter varying (LPV) system whose scheduling signals are, respectively, intake and offtake pressures. Running the two detectors simultaneously allows for leakage location. First, the pipeline is identified from operational data, supplied by REN-Gasodutos and using an LPV systems identification algorithm proposed in [1]. Each <b>leakage</b> <b>detector</b> uses two Kalman filters where the fault is viewed as an augmented state. The first filter estimates the flow using a calculated scheduling signal, assuming {{that there is no}} leakage. Therefore it works as a reference. The second one uses a measured scheduling signal and the augmented state is compared with the reference value. Whenever there is a significant difference, a leakage is detected.

40|$|An <b>Earth</b> <b>Leakage</b> Circuit Breaker (ELCB) is an {{electrical}} device that disconnects protected circuit whenever it detects unbalance current between the phase conductor and the neutral conductor. Such an unbalance is sometimes caused by current leakage {{through the body}} of a person who is grounded when accidentally touching the energized part of the circuit. A lethal shock can result from these conditions. ELCB are designed to disconnect this fault fast enough to mitigate the harm caused by such shocks. Currently, there is no <b>Earth</b> <b>Leakage</b> Circuit Breaker (ELCB) with auto re-closer features in the market. The current ELCB that available in the market is a manual type and cannot differentiate between temporary disturbances and permanent faults. It’s means that, if a disturbance or fault occurs on the protected area (house or shop), the protection system will force ELCB to trip. One of the drawbacks of the common ELCB is that, it’s can’t turn on the power supply back to the normal operation condition although only a short disturbance occurs. Such disturbance is lightning strike on the transmission line in the distribution site near to the protected area. To turn the power back to normal operation, consumers need to do that manually. To overcome this problem, Auto Re-closer <b>Earth</b> <b>Leakage</b> Circuit Breaker (AR-ELCB) has been developed. This thesis presents the development of AR-ELCB.
