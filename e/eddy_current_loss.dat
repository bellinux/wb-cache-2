50|$|If {{the applied}} voltage is normal voltage then normal flux {{will be set}} up. Since iron loss is a {{function}} of applied voltage, normal iron loss will occur. Hence the iron loss is maximum at rated voltage. This maximum iron loss is measured using the wattmeter. Since the impedance of the series winding of the transformer is very small compared to that of the excitation branch, all of the input voltage is dropped across the excitation branch. Thus the wattmeter measures only the iron loss. This test only measures the combined iron losses consisting of the hysteresis loss and the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>loss.</b> Although the hysteresis loss is less than the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>loss,</b> it is not negligible. The two losses can be separated by driving the transformer from a variable frequency source since the hysteresis loss varies linearly with supply frequency and the <b>eddy</b> <b>current</b> <b>loss</b> varies with the square.|$|E
