40|$|Cyclic AMP and dibutyeyl cyclic AMP {{produced}} the inhibitory {{action on the}} spike activity and contraction of the cat small intestine Beta-stimulants also exhibited the inhibitory action. Caffeine, <b>diprophylline,</b> papaverine and DCI {{produced the}} inhibitory effect. The inhibitions caused by caffeine, <b>diprophylline</b> and papaverine were depended on those metabolic action but a part of inhibitory action by papaverine seems to caused by the inhibition of spike activity. The relaxing effects of cyclic AMP and dibutyryl cyclic AMP were not blocked by propranolol and DCI and were potentiated by caffeine and <b>diprophylline.</b> Quiuidine blocked the inhibitory action of noradrenaline, AMP and cyclic AMP. Those findings {{support the hypothesis that}} cyclic AMP in cells relates the motility of intestinal smooth muscle. The spike activity was little influenced by exogenously applied cyclic AMP and dibutyryl cyclic AMP. Therefore, the inhibitory action of those agents may due to the inhibition on electrical activity partially...|$|E
40|$|Background: Zebrafish embryos are {{emerging}} {{as a model for}} pharmacological and toxicological studies. We used zebrafish embryos to study the general toxicity and cardiovascular effects of eight methylxanthines: aminophylline, caffeine, <b>diprophylline,</b> doxofylline, etophylline, 3 -isobutyl- 1 -methylxanthine (IBMX), pentoxifylline and theophylline. Methods: Microinjections of the eight methylxanthines were performed in 1 - 2 cell stage zebrafish embryos and the general toxicity and cardiovascular effects were analyzed at different time points. Embryotoxicity and teratogenicity were evaluated to understand the general toxicity of these compounds. Structural and functional alterations of the heart were evaluated to assess the cardiovascular effects. Results: Our results showed different activity patterns of the methylxanthines drugs. Caffeine, IBMX, pentoxifylline and theophylline were highly embryotoxic and teratogenic; aminophylline, doxofylline and etophylline were embryotoxic and teratogenic only at higher doses, and <b>diprophylline</b> showed a minimal (< 10...|$|E
40|$|The airway {{response}} to the inhalation of four alkyl xanthines was studied in 17 subjects with moderately severe asthma (mean FEV 1 1. 19 litres, 42 % predicted). Theophylline (10 mg/ml), glycine theophyllinate (50 mg/ml), theophylline ethylenediamine (aminophylline 50 mg/ml), and <b>diprophylline</b> (125 mg/ml) were administered by nebulisation and the airway response was measured as percentage change from baseline of specific airway conductance (sGaw). All xanthine derivatives had an unpleasant taste and produced coughing {{at the onset of}} nebulisation. All four xanthines produced a significant increase in sGaw by comparison with saline placebo, with a maximum mean increase from baseline of 35 % for theophylline, 40 % for glycine theophyllinate, 60 % for aminophylline, and 32 % for <b>diprophylline.</b> Inhalation of 200 micrograms salbutamol from a metered dose inhaler produced an additional increase in sGaw of 149 %. Thus alkyl substituted xanthines administered by inhalation to patients with asthma cause significant short lived bronchodilatation, but this effect is small compared with that of a conventional dose of an inhaled beta 2 adrenoceptor agonist...|$|E
40|$|A large {{variation}} is observed in induction times measured under equal conditions in 1 ml solutions. Ruling out experimental errors, this variation originates from the nucleation process. The induction time distribution {{is explained by}} the stochastic nature of nucleation {{if the number of}} nuclei formed is approaching 1 per vial. Accurate heterogeneous crystal nucleation rates were determined from the induction time distributions on a 1 ml scale for racemic <b>diprophylline</b> in two solvents. The difference in nucleation behaviour in the two solvents originates from the energy barrier for nucleation, which is much higher in the solvent in which induction times are much longer. In addition the pre-exponential factor for the crystal nucleation rate in both solvents is rather low compared to predictions using Classical Nucleation Theory. Unfortunately, concentration and surface characteristics of the effective heterogeneous particles are not known which clouds a further molecular interpretation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Active coating is an {{important}} unit operation in the pharmaceutical industry. The quality, stability, safety and performance of the final product largely depend on the amount and uniformity of coating applied. Active coating is challenging regarding {{the total amount of}} coating and its uniformity. Consequently, there is a strong demand for tools, which are able to monitor and determine the endpoint of a coating operation. In previous work, it was shown that Raman spectroscopy is an appropriate process analytical tool (PAT) to monitor an active spray coating process in a pan coater [1]. Using a multivariate model (Partial Least Squares—PLS) the Raman spectral data could be correlated with the coated amount of the API <b>diprophylline.</b> While the multivariate model was shown to be valid for the process in a mini scale pan coater (batch size: 3. 5 kg cores), the aim of the present work was to prove the robustness of the model by transferring the results to tablets coated in a micro scale pan coater (0. 5 kg). Method: Coating experiments were performed in both, a mini scale and a micro scale pan coater. The model drug <b>diprophylline</b> was coated on placebo tablets. The multivariate model, established for the process in the mini scale pan coater, was applied to the Raman measurements of tablets coated in the micro scale coater for six different coating levels. Then, the amount of coating, which was predicted by the model, was compared with reference measurements using UV spectroscopy. Results: For all six coating levels the predicted coating amount was equal to the amounts obtained by UV spectroscopy within the statistical error. Thus, it was possible to predict the total coating amount with an error smaller than 3. 6 %. The root mean squares of errors for calibration and prediction (root mean square of errors for calibration and prediction—RMSEC and RMSEP) were 0. 335 mg and 0. 392  mg, respectively, which means that the predictive power of the model is not dependent on the scale or the equipment. Conclusion: The scale-down experiment showed {{that it was possible to}} transfer the PLS model developed on a mini scale coater to a micro scale coater...|$|E
40|$|Hyperspectral {{coherent}} anti-Stokes Raman scattering (CARS) microscopy {{is quickly}} becoming a prominent imaging modality {{because of its}} many advantages over the traditional paradigm of multispectral CARS. In particular, recording {{a significant portion of}} the vibrational spectrum at each spatial pixel allows image-wide spectral analysis at much higher rates than can be achieved with spontaneous Raman. We recently developed a hyperspectral CARS method, the driving principle behind which is the fast acquisition and display of a hyperspectral datacube as a set of intuitive images wherein each material in a sample appears with a unique trio of colors. Here we use this system to image and analyze two types of polymorphic samples: the pseudopolymorphic hydration of theophylline, and the packing polymorphs of the sugar alcohol mannitol. In addition to these solid-state form modifications we have observed spectral variations of crystalline mannitol and <b>diprophylline</b> as functions of their orientations relative to the optical fields. We use that information to visualize the distributions of these compounds in a pharmaceutical solid oral dosage form...|$|E
40|$|Solid dispersions are {{commonly}} used to overcome bioavailability issues of poorly water soluble drugs. Various preparation methods along with carrier systems {{have been used to}} develop solid dispersions. However, this study investigates the application of microwave heating methods in formulation development alongside associated analytical investigations. Formulations of poorly soluble drugs, namely, fenofibrate, gemfibrozil, ibuprofen, ibuprofen (+) S and phenylbutazone were prepared using a microwave technique and compared with standard formulation techniques. Mesoporous silicas and polyethylene glycol were used as excipients. Then in vitro dissolution analysis was carried out for the performance evaluation of the resultant formulations. It was found that effective products were produced as a result of microwave processing compared with the traditional techniques. Analytical techniques such as differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffraction (XRD), scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy ((FTIR) were employed to determine the solid state properties, i. e. thermal stability, crystalline state, physical appearance and chemical stability of developed formulations. The overall findings indicate that successful formulation can be achieved using microwave heating. Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) was used to probe the interactions of model drugs, namely, caffeine, <b>diprophylline,</b> etofylline, paracetamol and theophylline with excipients such as sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), sodium deoxycholate (NaDC) and PEG. Thermodynamic data suggests the successful use of ITC to investigate drug-excipient interactions. In summary, the potential of microwave heating in formulation development and ITC to characterise drug-excipient interactions was thoroughly investigated and both found as potential alternatives to more traditional techniques...|$|E
40|$|Crystallization is an {{essential}} step in many processes in chemical industries, ranging from bulk chemicals to special products. It is a separation and purification technique that results in a solid particulate product, which is generally preferred in the pharmaceutical industry. The crystal product quality {{is determined by the}} specific crystal form (polymorph) crystallized, and by the crystal size, morphology and purity. It depends heavily on the process conditions under which crystal nucleation occurs. During the crystal nucleation event, parameters that are essential for the product quality, in particular the polymorph formed, are not very well established. The nucleation event is still poorly understood and is therefore difficult to control and optimize. Crystal nucleation sets the initial crystal size distribution at the start of unseeded batch crystallization processes and is the first and most important step in this process (Chapter 1). A fundamental understanding of crystal nucleation is needed for the rigorous control and prediction of the crystalline product quality of any crystallization processes on industrial scale. Also the lead compounds in pharmaceutical industry become more and more complex. As a result crystallization research becomes increasingly fundamental while model compounds have shifted from bulk chemicals to high added-value chemicals. A fundamental understanding of molecular processes during crystallization is becoming increasingly important not in the least when applied on an industrial scale. In this thesis we improve the knowledge and understanding of crystal nucleation of organic compounds from solution. The research starts with comparing two newly developed methods to measure heterogeneous nucleation kinetics by determining crystal nucleation rates in stirred solutions (Chapter 2). Both methods make use of the stochastic nature of crystal nucleation by determining and analysing the variation in nucleation kinetic measurements. The values of the kinetic parameter (A) obtained in the present thesis are low compared to the theoretical values. This could be due to both a lower than expected attachment frequency of building units to the nucleus and a lower than expected concentration of active nucleation sites (heterogeneous particles) in the solution. It was further identified that the single nucleus mechanism, in which all crystals in the suspension originate from the same parent single crystal, might occur more generally than is currently recognized, even in larger volumes. In this thesis we used concomitant polymorphism as a tool to validate this single nucleus mechanism (Chapter 3). The single nucleus mechanism has important implications for the control of industrial crystallization processes of polymorphic compounds. In terms of crystal size distribution, control can be obtained by controlling the secondary rather than the primary nucleation event for which completely different control procedures are needed. In terms of polymorphism, the control can be achieved by controlling the primary nucleation event that leads to the single crystal, which in turn defines the crystal form of the secondary nuclei. One of the major challenges the pharmaceutical industry is faced in production, where often during cooling crystallization the product separates not as crystals but as a viscous liquid. This phenomenon is referred to as oiling out or liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS). The effect of LLPS on the crystallization of 4 -hydroxyacetophenon (4 HAP) in water, water-ethanol mixtures and ethyl acetate solutions were shown in Chapter 4. For HAP, the LLPS is a stable region above the saturation temperature of 52 °C, 36 °C and 30 °C of 4 HAP in water, water-ethanol (90 - 10 wt%) and water-ethanol (80 - 20 wt%) mixtures, respectively. Cooling crystallization experiments always resulted into mixtures of polymorphic fractions if the LLPS preceded 4 HAP crystallization. The results suggest that the crystallization behavior is strongly influenced by the presence of this LLPS. Due to the LLPS the nucleation may proceed on the droplet surface and the single nucleus mechanism does not hold anymore. The crystallization within the LLPS region seems to lead to agglomeration of the particles. One of the causes for the low kinetic parameter A of the nucleation rate equation was identified in Chapter 3 to be the building units that attach to the nucleus and thus determine the attachment frequency. The effect of these solution-building units or associates in solution was investigated in Chapter 5. The model compound used was isonicotinamide, which has an amide group that can form both homosynthons and heterosynthons by self-association. We show that, in a controlled and reproducible way, specific solvents lead to specific polymorphic forms of isonicotinamide. We argue on the basis of Raman and FTIR spectroscopy that the hydrogen bonding (self-association) in solution kinetically drives the nucleation towards a specific form. The self-association in solution reflects the crystal structure of the obtained polymorph. The method based on self-association of molecules in solution may help in reproducible production of polymorphs. In chapter 6 we propose a polymorph screening method based on the identification of crystal building units using Raman, FTIR and NMR techniques. We demonstrated this new approach by relating the structural outcome of the crystallization process of Isonicotinamide (INA), Nicotinamide (NA), Picolinamide (PA), Carbamazepine (CBZ) and <b>Diprophylline</b> (DPL) to the association and self-association processes in solutions, which are largely influenced by the hydrogen bonding capacity of the solvent. The screening method based on the identification of crystal building units may help to discover new polymorphs. The self-association method offers the ability to identify solvents or solvent mixtures that promote or avoid the presence of specific building units and in this way control the building unit towards polymorphs having specific structural features. As identified in chapter 3, another cause for the low kinetic factor in nucleation is the heterogeneous particle. Nothing is known about the actual concentration and functionality of these heterogeneous particles while they tremendously affect nucleation behavior. We therefore investigated the interplay between self-associates in solution and well-defined heterogeneous template surface by studying the crystallization behavior of isonicotinamide (INA) and 2, 6 -dihydroxy benzoic acid (DHB) (Chapter 7). Well-defined templates were prepared by making Self-Assembled Monolayers (SAM) onto a gold surface. The self-association of INA and DHB were investigated using spectroscopic techniques. Raman spectroscopy of the crystal-template surface after template crystallization suggests that molecular interactions between INA or DHB associates and the SAM are responsible for the formation of specific polymorphs. XRPD helped in the identification of the crystal orientation on the template surface further verifying the importance of solute interactions with the functionalized template surface. The systematic analysis of the association processes in solutions and the interplay with well-defined templates is beneficial in the development of polymorph discovery and preparation methods as well as control over crystallization processes. Industrially, the thesis results may not only help to discover new polymorphs but can also help in reproducible industrial production of polymorphs. On Industrial scale seeding approaches using only a single crystal can lead to the avoidance of primary nucleation and thus control over the polymorph obtained. The combination of well-defined template surfaces and the self-association method {{can be used as a}} screening method in the early drug discovery and development phase but also define robust conditions for industrial crystallization of polymorphs. This will not only help to discover and reproducibly prepare polymorphs, but a more comprehensive screening can be performed at reduced cost. Industries can implement the results to improve crystal product qualities and can also discover and optimize the quality of new crystal products by incorporating the methods in the development process. Scientifically, this thesis opened the route towards a thorough study of heterogeneous nucleation of polymorphic compounds taking into account self-association, template effects and relative stability of polymorphs. Such a study would result in an accurate molecular interpretation of crystal nucleation and would finally enable the validation of heterogeneous nucleation theories. As analytical techniques become more and more powerful, finding new and better ways to powerful insights in the crystal nucleation research become easier. Utilization of these principles and tools not only allow studying crystal nucleation, but also allows the understanding of nucleation processes to a new level. Molecular simulations are still needed to bridge the gap between solution chemistry and crystal nucleation rate analysis to come to a molecular interpretation of crystal nucleation of organic compounds. The new experimental approaches described in this thesis will boost the existing methods for polymorph prediction and in particular for predicting the conditions for polymorph formation.
