40|$|<b>Drop</b> <b>out</b> among school {{children}} {{especially at the}} basic school level has over the years gained the attention of many ministries of education, international organizations and scholars in the academia. It is said to inhabit threat to achieving universal primary education (UPE) everywhere, especially in Sub-Saharan Africa. To some recent studies, the phenomenon of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is said to be}} somewhat responsible for increased crime in some parts of Africa. It is the goal of this study to understand why students <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school in Ghana and also what strategies there are to mitigate it. The study does so by comparing rural <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> to that of the urban as it carried out field work in four schools in five different communities. The study used the qualitative research approach to address what factors there were in causing children to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school and what strategies are laid down by the government, better still the Ghana Education service in reducing <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The study employed semi-structured interviews to gather data from the various stake holders- directors of education, circuit supervisors, head teachers, teachers, parents and most importantly the <b>drop</b> <b>outs</b> themselves. Such data was collected from the four schools in the five communities in both the rural and urban areas chosen for this study. The study investigated six factors as influencing <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> among {{school children}} in the selected areas. It also identified both macro and micro- level strategies for mitigating <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in the rural and urban schools. The study shows how the contextual differences of children, among others can influence their decision to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school. The study indicates that <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> among school children in both rural and urban areas is predominantly caused by poverty, child labour, academic performance, pregnancy, corporal punishment (CP) and school context. The study makes clearer that such factors that cause children to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> of school are not adequately independent but there are cases where one factor may coincide with the other to bring about <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> decision. It makes explicit that that the individual and institutional related factors of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> sometimes work in connection with one another culminating in <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Like it has been said earlier, macro and micro level strategies are found for mitigating <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in rural and urban schools in Ghana. The macro strategies identified include, school feeding programme, free school uniform distribution and free education. The micro strategies include effective teaching, child safety, child friendly school environment, scholarship, guidance and counseling, introduction of kindergarten, role of NGOs, role of the family, communal by laws, among others.

40|$|Thesis (MCom (Industrial Psychology)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012 Student {{intention}} to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{is a concern}} for higher education institutions as well for their students. Students with the {{intention to}} <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> may eventually <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> and contribute towards the already high dropout rates, which are causing economic damage. Students leaving their institution have vast financial consequences for their institution, as institutions obtain grants from the government according to their success rates. Although previous {{research has been conducted}} on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out,</b> it is limited, especially when looking at possible predictors that are specific to the South African context. This study contributes towards the gap in research regarding the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The objectives of this study were to 1) conceptualise the possible predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> according to the literature; 2) determine if self-evaluation traits (self-esteem and self-efficacy) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 3) determine if student burnout and student engagement are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; 4) determine if social support (social support from parents and general social support) are significant predictors of student intention to drop out; and 5) determine if career decision-making difficulties are significant predictors of student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> A non-probability quota sample (N = 782) was used to investigate possible predictors of career student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in a sample of university students. Student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> was measured by one item consisting of two categories: I have no intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 501), and I have an intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> (n = 280). These two groups were enclosed as a dependent variable in the logistic regression. The variables included in the final model predicted between 13 % (Cox and Snell) and 18 % (Nagelkerke) of the variance in intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> The {{results of this study suggest}} that self-esteem had an influence on student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Furthermore, it was found that cynicism and dedication have a significant relationship with student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Lastly, lack of information about ways to obtain information also indicated a significant relationship with student intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Thus, it may be concluded that self-esteem, burnout and engagement and lack of information about ways of obtaining information have an influence on students’ intention to <b>drop</b> <b>out.</b> Recommendations were made for practice as well as for future research.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—The <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> {{rates in}} {{different}} longitudinal studies of musculoskeletal disorders range between 7 % and 57 %, and {{little is known}} about the characteristics of the subjects who <b>dropped</b> <b>out.</b> The aim was to analyse various consequences of <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> in a longitudinal study of musculoskeletal disorders and occupational risk factors during 1969 - 97.  METHOD—Data about occupational conditions and health in 1969  and in 1993  were analysed. Differences between those who participated throughout (participants) and <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects in these analyses formed the basis for recalculations of earlier reported analyses of associations between occupational conditions and low back pain. In the recalculation the data were weighted to compensate for the differences.  RESULTS—More female and male <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects than participants in 1993  had monotonous work, fewer women and more male <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects had heavy lifting in 1969.  In 1997, more female and male <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects had had heavy lifting and low stimulation at work in 1993.  At both occasions, there were differences between the <b>drop</b> <b>out</b> subjects and participants in occurrence of musculoskeletal disorders.
