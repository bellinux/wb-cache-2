40|$|The river can be {{considered}} as a complex term of relationships, for the ecological connections with territory and environment, towards the settlements of populations, towards the anthropological transformations, and, in particular, towards the projects and the management of the <b>fluvial</b> <b>resources.</b> The whole thing can be referred to the continuous becoming of the complex fluvial phenomenon, which is related - often problematically – to many processes, both environmental and social. Interpretative consequent criteria, of projects, participation, social involvement. Some study cases will be described.   </div...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a telemetry {{data acquisition system}} named EB. The EB itself is a subsystem of a greater one, named Affluence Foresight and Cistern Operation System, which manages the CESP’s (Electric Co. of São Paulo State) <b>fluvial</b> <b>resources.</b> Its main function is to collect hydrometeorological data from remote sites, linked by a telemetry network. The EB was developed in a PC-like microcomputer. Its source code {{was written in the}} C program-ming language and the development environment was a UNIX-like one named ANALIX. It is composed of 11 concurrent processes which carry out various tasks, such as the activation of periodic enquiry cycles, manual enquiry of instruments located at remote sites and reports emissions. The EB serves {{as an example of the}} usage of UNIX-like environments to design small microcomputer-based automation systems. Moreover, we present a framework for the design of such systems...|$|E
40|$|The {{monographic}} volume analyses {{the evolution}} of prehistoric population and settlement patterns in the western valleys of Cantabria (Spain). The work applies the theoretical basis of ecological history to develop a model of settlement pattern in prehistoric Cantabria. Its theoretical foundation {{is the concept of}} mode of resource Use -M. R. U. -, (Guha y Gadgil 1993) that examines the relations between human groups and its environment beyond an economic or a Marxist perspective. The model is geographically focused on the western Cantabrian valleys with their multiple different ecological zones, ranging from temperate coastal to the supalpine climate all compressed within 40 Km. The archaeological record in this area is characterized by a disparate settlement pattern in each prehistoric period, and is linked to different resource use strategies in each of them. Probably the more important contribution of this approach is the explanation of transitional moments and the Neolithisation process. Although the scarcity of data limits our knowledge, we suggest that the Mousterian focus on strategic points for hunting changes in the Upper Paleolithic to a preference for sea and <b>fluvial</b> <b>resources.</b> Settlements are typically located near the bottom valleys at the confluence of two rivers, and the ideological change is reflected in the presence of art in the main sites of this period (Fuente del Salín and Chufín). In the Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene, environmental changes reduce the coastal plain with people occupying the inland mountains such as at La Calvera rockshelter (1100 m.). Nevertheless, the distribution of the recent Mesolithic sites (Asturian shell-middens) shows an exclusive preference for the coast line. These groups develop a stable socio-economic system upon the exploitation of seasonal resources, as shown in Mazaculos Cave. In this context, the first Neolithic occurs around 5, 500 BP, and is reflected in the construction of megaliths. The first two Neolithic houses documented at the Pena Oviedo site (1250 m above sea level) demonstrate the strong relation between megaliths and habitat areas. This resulted in a new emphasis on pastoralism as an economic strategy. These nomadic practices change in the Calcolithic and the Bronze Ages when the first forthills were built...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe European InterReg IV GeDSeT project (2008 - 2013) is a {{contribution}} to a sustainable management of waterways sediments, {{in order to develop}} good practice for the development of regional <b>fluvial</b> transport, water <b>resource</b> protection and land resources preservation. The GeDSeT decision support tool (DST), one of the results of this project, carried out as a partnership between Ecole des Mines de Douai, ISSeP, CTP, INERIS and BRGM, members of the GIS- 3 SP cluster, aims to provide sediment management options with relevant quantitative data, in order to evaluate various scenarios taking into account cost and sustainability...|$|R
40|$|Disruption of flow {{regimes and}} {{sediment}} supplies, induced by anthropogenic or climatic factors, can produce dramatic alterations in river form, vegetation patterns, and associated habitat conditions. To improve habitat in these <b>fluvial</b> systems, <b>resource</b> managers may {{choose from a}} variety of treatments including flow and/or sediment prescriptions, vegetation management, or engineered approaches. Monitoring protocols developed to assess the morphologic response of these treatments require techniques that can measure topographic changes above and below the water surface efficiently, accurately, and in a standardized, cost-effective manner. Similarly, modeling of flow, sediment transport, habitat, and channel evolution requires characterization of river morphology for model input and verification. Recent developments by the U. S. Geological Survey with regard to both remotely sensed methods (the Experimental Advanced Airborne Research LiDAR; EAARL) and computational modeling software (the Multi-Dimensional Surface-Water Modeling System; MD_SWMS) have produced advanced tools for spatially explicit monitoring and modeling in aquatic environments. In this paper, we present a pilot study conducted along the Platte River, Nebraska, that demonstrates the combined use of these river science tools...|$|R
40|$|Present {{study on}} fishing methods {{in the upper}} Ganga River system was {{conducted}} during the period 2010 - 2012. Upper Ganga river system consists of two major rivers basins viz. Alaknanda and Bhagirathi rivers and number of their 1 st and 2 nd order tributaries which flows through Garhwal region (Central Himalaya). This large network of <b>fluvial</b> water <b>resources</b> harbours rich Ichthyofaunal diversity. The varied potential of fish resources from these water bodies permits the utilization of wide array of fishing methods. Most of the fishing methods of the Garhwal region are primitive, based on indigenous traditional knowledge and well suited to turbulent nature of the streams. In present study eighteen fishing methods and gears have been documented from the upper Ganga River system. Study observed season, habitat and species specificity of the fishing methods. The utilization of crude and unscientific fishing methods is frequent in the streams of remote areas resulting into decline in fish resource. All the fishing methods employed in upper Ganga River system are classified into four types. The classification is based on their utilisation up to the level which will allow the sustainable harvesting and proper management of valuable fish resources...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe Haute-Romanche valley, {{located in}} the Massif des Écrins, was widely glaciated during the LGM. Nowadays, the Romanche river is an {{effluent}} of two separated glaciers: the Clot des Cavales and the Plate des Agneaux. From the current glaciers fronts to the downstream neoglacial moraines, five successive rockfalls were identified. Their locations are probably linked to preferential areas of postglacial debutressing expression. These large rockfalls produce a semi-permanent environmental partitioning of the valley by controlling sediment flux and fluvial patterns. The objectives of the study are to quantitatively assess the partitioning functions of rockfalls of various volume on the streams long profiles, the downstream fluvial pattern succession and the spatial distribution of archaeological evidences. The topographic surveys of the Haute-Romanche valley floor and rockfalls were done using terrestrial multi-image photogrammetry coupled {{to a set of}} DGPS ground controlpoints. The long profiles of the rivers were achieved with DGPS survey. Volumes of rockfalls were estimated by topographic modeling and volumetric computation using GIS software <b>resources.</b> <b>Fluvial</b> pattern analysis and archaeological mapping were completed based on photo-interpretation and field observations. Results show that river channel morphology is highly dependent of rockfall location and volume. Consequently, the downstream river patterns succession is deeply disturbed inducing a long-term segmentation of the fluvial continuum. This longitudinal partitioning of hydro-sedimentary dynamics has potentially major ecological, geoarchaeological and management implications...|$|R
40|$|River deltas {{belong to}} the most densely settled places on earth. Although they only account for 5 % of the global land surface, over 550 million people live in deltas. These {{preferred}} livelihood locations, which feature flat terrain, fertile alluvial soils, access to <b>fluvial</b> and marine <b>resources,</b> a rich wetland biodiversity and other advantages are, however, threatened by numerous internal and external processes. Socio-economic development, urbanization, climate change induced sea level rise, as well as flood pulse changes due to upstream water diversion all lead to changes in these highly dynamic systems. A thorough understanding of a river delta’s general setting and intra-annual as well as long-term dynamic is therefore crucial for an informed management of natural resources. Here, remote sensing can {{play a key role}} in analyzing and monitoring these vast areas at a global scale. The goal of this study is to demonstrate the potential of intra-annual time series analyses at dense temporal, but coarse spatial resolution for inundation characterization in five river deltas located in four different countries. Based on 250 m MODIS reflectance data we analyze inundation dynamics in four densely populated Asian river deltas—namely the Yellow River Delta (China), the Mekong Delta (Vietnam), the Irrawaddy Delta (Myanmar), and the Ganges-Brahmaputra (Bangladesh, India) —as well as one very contrasting delta: the nearly uninhabited polar Mackenzie Delta Region in northwestern Canada for the complete time span of one year (2013). A complex processing chain of water surface derivation on a daily basis allows the generation of intra-annual time series, which indicate inundation duration in each of the deltas. Our analyses depict distinct inundation patterns within each of the deltas, which can be attributed to processes such as overland flooding, irrigation agriculture, aquaculture, or snowmelt and thermokarst processes. Clear differences between mid-latitude, subtropical, and polar deltas are illustrated, and the advantages and limitations of the approach for inundation derivation are discussed...|$|R
