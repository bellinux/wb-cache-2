50|$|The term <b>fixed</b> <b>maturity</b> is {{applicable}} to {{any form of}} financial instrument under which the loan is due to be repaid on a fixed date. This includes fixed interest and variable rate loans or debt instruments, whatever they are called, and also other forms of security such as redeemable preference shares, provided their terms of issue specify a date. It is similar in meaning to 'redemption date'. However some such instruments may have no <b>fixed</b> <b>maturity</b> date. Loans with no maturity date continue indefinitely (unless repayment is agreed between the borrower and the lenders at some point) and may be known as 'perpetual stocks'. Some instruments {{have a range of}} possible maturity dates, and such stocks can usually be repaid at any time within that range, as chosen by the borrower.|$|E

30|$|To {{investigate}} this further, daily time series of pure discount bonds were constructed from data on yields to maturity {{each day for}} a variety of maturities. The data comes at specific maturities that vary each day. By interpolation, pure discount bond prices were derived for the <b>fixed</b> <b>maturities</b> of 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months and 2, 5, 10, 15, and 20 years. The data set went from January 3, 2007, to August 29, 2017, for 2782 days. Beginning on December 19, 2007, and employing on a rolling basis of 252 days of past returns on each of the 10 time series, bilateral gamma parameters of motion were estimated for the logarithm of the pure discount bond prices (see the next section for further estimation details). One obtains as a result, 2530 sets of bilateral gamma parameters for each of the ten pure discount bonds.|$|R

We then investigate empirically whether current option prices at multiple maturities contain useful information in predicting future option prices and future implied volatility. We undertake this investigation using data on options on the euro-dollar, sterling-dollar, and dollar-yen exchange rates. We find that prices across maturities do indeed have predictive value. Moreover, we find that model-based forward volatility extracts this predicative information better than a standard “model-free ” measure of forward volatility and better than spot implied volatility.

50|$|With their <b>fixed</b> <b>maturity</b> date, fixed {{dividend}} rate and seniority over common stock, the preferred shares {{have many of}} the characteristics of a bond, and thus one might expect their value on the secondary market to vary inversely with the prevailing interest rates, just like a bond.

In practice credit risk appears to be a greater factor in the valuation of the relatively thinly traded preferred shares as opposed to the value of alternative (and more efficiently traded) conventional fixed-income instruments like bonds.|$|E

50|$|Until late 2014 {{there existed}} eight undated gilts, which {{made up a}} very small {{proportion}} of the UK government's debt. They had no <b>fixed</b> <b>maturity</b> date. These gilts were very old: some, such as Consols, dated from the 18th century. The largest, War Loan, was issued in the early 20th century. The redemption of these bonds was {{at the discretion of}} the UK government, but because of their age, they all had low coupons, and so for a long time there was little incentive for the government to redeem them. Because the outstanding amounts were relatively very small, there was a very limited market in most of these gilts. In late 2014 and early 2015 the government gave notice that four of these gilts, including War Loan, would be redeemed in early 2015.

50|$|As {{with many}} leading ideas, the {{principle}} of the timer call is remarkably simple: instead of a dealer needing to use an implied volatility to use in pricing the option, the volatility is <b>fixed,</b> and the <b>maturity</b> is left floating. As a result of this, the Timer Call allows the pricing of call and put options on underlyings for which ordinary options are not priced; dealers in a normal option are exposed to the difference between the volatility they estimate and the realised volatility, whereas in a Timer Call, this risk is much diminished.|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the modelling of the term structure of interest rates, with a particular focus on empirical aspects of the modelling. In this thesis, we explore the &# 952;-parameterised (&# 952; being the length of time to maturity) term structure of interest rates, corresponding to the traditional T-parameterised (T being the time of maturity) term structure of interest rates. The constructions of Australian yield curves are illustrated using generic yield curves produced by the Reserve Bank of Australia based on bonds on issue and by constructed yield curves of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia derived from swap rates. The data used to build the models is Australian Treasury yields from January 1996 to December 2001 for maturities of 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 years, and the second data used to validate the model is Australian Treasury yields from July 2000 to April 2004 for maturities of all years from 1 - 10. Both data were supplied by the Reserve Bank of Australia. Initially, univariate Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH), with models of individual yield increment time series are developed for a set of <b>fixed</b> <b>maturities.</b> Then, a multivariate Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution of the term structure of yield increments is developed. This model captures many important properties of financial data such as volatility mean reversion, volatility persistency, stationarity and heavy tails. There are two innovations of GARCH modelling in this thesis: (i) the development of the Matrix-Diagonal GARCH model with multivariate asymmetric t-distribution using meta-elliptical distribution in which the degrees of freedom of each series varies with maturity, and the estimation is given; (ii) the development of a GARCH model of term structure of interest rates (TS-GARCH). The TS-GARCH model describes the parameters specifying the GARCH model and the degrees of freedom using simple smooth functions of time to maturity of component series. TS-GARCH allows an empirical description of complete interest rate yield curve increments therefore allowing the model to be used for interpolation to additional maturity beyond those used to construct the model. Diagnostics of TS-GARCH model are provided using Australian Treasury bond yields...|$|R

This has not deterred the growth of the assumption that FLOSS is higher quality than traditionally developed software, despite of mixed research results. With this literature review, we found the reason for these mixed results is that that quality is being defined, measured, and evaluated differently. We report the most popular definitions, such as software structure measures, process measures, such as defect <b>fixing,</b> and <b>maturity</b> assessment models. The way researchers have built their samples has also contributed to the mixed results with different project properties being considered and ignored. Because FLOSS projects are evolving, their quality is too, and it must be measured using metrics that take into account its community’s commitment to quality rather than just its software structure. Challenges exist in defining what constitutes a defect or bug, and the role of modularity in affecting FLOSS quality...|$|R

The term structures have many interesting shapes, and we provide some empirical evidence from refined oil future prices at NYMEX defending our modeling idea. Motivated from these results, we present a cointegrated forward price dynamics using the Heath–Jarrow–Morton approach. In this setting, the concept of cointegration is extended to what we call cointegration in the limit, which is an asymptotic form of the notion. The Margrabe formula for spread option prices is shown to hold, with an explicit plug-in volatility. We present several numerical examples showing that cointegration leads to significantly cheaper spread options compared to the complete market case, where cointegration disappears with respect to the pricing measure...|$|R
