5|$|Furious {{with the}} marriage, Babli's family asked for {{intervention}} {{from the local}} khap panchayat, which annulled the marriage. The khap also announced a social boycott on Manoj's family. Anyone who kept ties with them would be fined ₨25,000. Ompati tried to persuade her family that Babli <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> dishonourable and that she and Manoj would move back home soon.|$|E

5|$|Scripps {{was convicted}} of his first crime in May 1974, when {{he was sentenced to}} a 12-month {{conditional}} discharge and fined £10 by Highgate Juvenile Court for burglary. The punishment <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to deter him from stealing, and by August 1976 he had stolen again three times. In June 1978, he was fined £40 for indecent assault.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier was {{influenced}} {{by a number of}} authors. Jean Price Mars's Ainsi parla l'oncle (So Spoke the Uncle) presents two arguments that Carpentier applied to his historical approach: firstly, {{from the perspective of a}} Haitian peasant, the Revolution <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> more than replace leaders, since the exploitation continued; secondly, Price Mars assumes the authenticity of the belief in African gods, in contrast with a shallow Catholicism. William Seabrook's The Magic Island made connections between religion and history and was considered a beautiful book by Carpentier.|$|E
5|$|King William {{appears to}} have left the {{initiative}} for Stigand's deposition to the papacy, and <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to hinder Stigand's authority until the papal legates arrived in England to depose the archbishop and reform the English Church. Besides witnessing charters and consecrating Remigius, Stigand {{appears to have}} been a member of the royal council, and able to move freely about the country. But after the arrival of the legates, William <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to protect Stigand from deposition, and the archbishop later accused the king of acting with bad faith. Stigand may even have been surprised that the legates wished him deposed. It was probably the death of Ealdred in 1069 that moved the pope to send the legates, as that left only one archbishop in England; and he was not considered legitimate and unable to consecrate bishops. The historian George Garnett draws the parallel between the treatment of King Harold in Domesday Book, where he is essentially ignored as king, and Stigand's treatment after his deposition, where his time as archbishop is as much as possible treated as not occurring.|$|E

5|$|Kutuzov {{was very}} {{strongly}} {{concerned that the}} French might take the New Smolensk Road around his positions and on to Moscow so placed the more powerful 1stArmy under Barclay on the right, in positions which were already strong and virtually unassailable by the French. The 2ndArmy under Bagration was expected to hold the left. The fall of Shevardino unanchored the Russian left flank but Kutuzov <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to change these initial dispositions despite the repeated pleas of his generals to redeploy their forces.|$|E
5|$|On 28 March 1902 the 4th Earl Temple died aged 55, {{succeeded by}} Algernon William Stephen Temple-Gore-Langton, 5th Earl Temple of Stowe. The Oxford & Aylesbury Tramroad Company, which by now <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> except collect £600 annual rent from the MR, pay the Winwood Charity Trust rent for their land near Quainton Road crossed by the rails, and pay Earl Temple an annual {{dividend}} of £400, remained independent {{under the control}} of the 4th Earl's trustees.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to chase them down throughout the race. It was on a section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) {{broke away from the}} lead group to try for the victory. As if the success of the breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E

5|$|The Pagan Empire {{disintegrated}} and anarchy ensued. The Mongols, {{who probably}} preferred the situation, <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> {{to restore order}} in the next ten years. In March 1297, they accepted the voluntary submission of King Kyawswa of Pagan although he controlled little beyond {{the capital city of}} Pagan (Bagan). But Kyawswa was overthrown nine months later, and the Mongols were forced to intervene, leading to their second invasion in 1300–01.|$|E
5|$|The {{dismissal}} of Constantine was not unanimously {{supported by the}} Entente powers; while France and Britain <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to stop Jonnart's actions, the Russian provisional government officially protested to Paris. Petrograd demanded that Alexander should not receive the title of king but only that of regent so as to preserve {{the rights of the}} deposed sovereign and the Crown Prince. Russia's protests were brushed aside, and Alexander ascended the Greek throne.|$|E
5|$|As {{tensions}} rose {{between the}} colonists and Britain {{in the early}} 1770s, Philipse remained loyal to the crown. He was arrested in August 1776 and held in Connecticut until a parole grant {{at the end of}} the year allowed him to return home as long as he <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to support the British war effort. He broke that promise the next spring: he attempted, perhaps at the behest of his wife, to inform the British that a passing column of Continental Army troops was headed south to attack a British camp at Morrisania, now in the Bronx. Shortly afterwards he fled to British-occupied New York; he would never return to his home along the Saw Mill.|$|E

5|$|Dissatisfaction {{became more}} evident during the 1880s, and some {{officers}} began to display open insubordination. The Emperor {{and the politicians}} <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to improve the military nor meet their demands. The dissemination of Positivist ideology among young officers brought further complications, as Positivism opposed the monarchy under the belief that a dictatorial republic would bring improvements. A coalition between a mutinous Army faction and the Positivist camp was formed and directly led to the republican coup on 15 November 1889. Battalions and even full regiments of soldiers loyal to the Empire, who shared {{the ideals of the}} older generation of leaders, attempted to restore the monarchy. Attempts at a restoration proved futile and supporters of the Empire were executed, arrested or forcibly retired.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} year of his administration, Jones and five others were {{traveling}} in a state helicopter from Frankfort to Fort Knox when a tail rotor blade snapped, causing the helicopter to crash in Shelby County. The pilot was able to guide the helicopter into a treetop to soften the impact. No one was killed, but Jones suffered a severe back strain and a bruised kidney. The National Transportation Safety Board later determined that the pilot and co-pilot had not properly attached an engine cowling that knocked off the tail rotor blade. Both pilots maintained that they <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> wrong, and Jones credited them for the survival of the passengers aboard the helicopter.|$|E
5|$|Eaton {{took his}} revenge on Calhoun. In 1830, reports had emerged {{accurately}} stating that Calhoun, as Secretary of War, had favored censuring Jackson for his 1818 invasion of Florida. These infuriated Jackson. For reasons unclear, Calhoun asked Eaton to approach Jackson {{about the possibility}} of Calhoun publishing his correspondence with Jackson {{at the time of the}} Seminole War. Eaton <b>did</b> <b>nothing.</b> This caused Calhoun to believe that Jackson had approved the publication of the letters. Calhoun published them in the United States Telegraph, a newspaper edited by a Calhoun protégé, Duff Green. This gave the appearance of Calhoun trying to justify himself against a conspiracy to damage him, and further enraged the President.|$|E

5|$|Even {{though the}} battle of San Lorenzo is {{acknowledged}} in Argentine historiography as an important battle for Argentine independence, it had little military influence in the conflict. Much of the recognition the battle generated is because San Martín fought in it, as {{the size of the}} forces involved and the length of the clash would normally mean it was considered a military engagement rather than a real battle and it did not influence the development of the Argentine War of Independence. This victory <b>did</b> <b>nothing</b> to prevent further raids from royalist ships as there were new raids at Tigre on August 18, 1813 and yet another one at San Fernando on August 22. William Brown ended the royalist naval supremacy the following year.|$|E
5|$|In 550, Artabanes was {{appointed}} magister militum per Thracias {{and sent to}} replace the aged senator Liberius in command of an expedition under way against Sicily, which had recently been overrun by the Ostrogoth king Totila. Artabanes failed {{to catch up with}} the expedition before it sailed for Sicily, and his own fleet was driven back and scattered by severe storms in the Ionian Sea. Eventually he arrived in Sicily and took command of the Byzantine forces there. He besieged the Gothic garrisons left behind by Totila after he left the island and soon forced them to surrender. Over the next two years, he remained in Sicily. According to Procopius, the inhabitants of the mainland city of Croton, which was being besieged by the Goths, repeatedly sent to him for help, but he <b>did</b> <b>nothing.</b>|$|E
