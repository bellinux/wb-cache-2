5|$|August 30, 1999– Hurricane Dennis {{parallels}} the state offshore, and {{five days later}} it executes a loop and makes landfall along Cape Lookout National Seashore as a strong tropical storm. The hurricane drops heavy rainfall peaking at 19.9inches (506mm) in Ocracoke, while its extended duration offshore causes localized severe beach erosion. The rainfall causes flooding along several rivers, which <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> effects of Hurricane Floyd just weeks later. Damage in the state amounts to over $50million.|$|E
5|$|GRCs {{have been}} criticized as {{creating}} unequal voting powers between electors. At present, one vote in a GRC ward returns five or six candidates into Parliament, compared with one vote in a SMC ward, which only returns one candidate. The GRC scheme has also diluted electors' voting power. For instance, in an SMC ward there are around 14,000 voters, compared to 140,000 voters in a five- or six-member GRC. Thus, the power of each vote in a GRC is lower than in an SMC, as each voter in a GRC finds it harder to vote out an MP {{that he or she}} does not like. The situation <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that a 30% deviation from equality of electoral divisions is tolerated. Another commentator has pointed out that the current MP-to-voter guide ratio is one MP to 26,000 voters, which implies that the number of voters in an electoral division can vary between 18,200 and 33,800. By extrapolation, a five-member GRC can have between 91,000 and 169,000 voters, a difference of 86%.|$|E
25|$|The Pirahã {{language}} is most notable {{as the subject}} of various controversial claims; for example, that it provides evidence for linguistic relativity. The controversy <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> sheer difficulty of learning the language; the number of linguists with field experience in Pirahã is very small.|$|E

25|$|The {{historical}} veiling of {{the relationship}} between Catholic saints and Orichás <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact {{that the vast majority of}} santeros in Cuba, Puerto Rico, and the Dominican Republic, are also Roman Catholics, have been baptized, and often require initiates to be baptized in Roman Catholicism as well.|$|E
25|$|The {{prevalence}} {{of child sexual}} abuse in Africa <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> virgin cleansing myth that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure a man of HIV or AIDS. The myth is prevalent in South Africa, Zimbabwe, Zambia and Nigeria and is being blamed for the high rate of sexual abuse against young children.|$|E

25|$|Organ {{transplant}} recipients in China {{are generally}} not told {{the identity of the}} organ donor, nor are they provided with evidence of written consent. In some cases even the identity of the medical staff and surgeons may be withheld from patients.

25|$|Fungi {{tend to be}} {{composed}} of soft tissues, making fossilization difficult and the discovery of fungal fossils incredibly rare. This <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> microscopic size and ephemeral nature of ectomycorrhizas and their structure. However, some exquisitely preserved specimens have been discovered in the middle Eocene Princeton Chert of British Columbia. These ectomycorrhizal fossils show clear evidence of a Hartig net, mantle and hyphae, demonstrating well-established EcM associations at least 50 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The grid's {{inherent}} {{high street}} and intersection frequencies produce {{large areas of}} impermeable surfaces in the street pavement and the sidewalks. In comparison to recent networks with discontinuous street types, grids can be up to 30% higher in impermeable surfaces attributable to roads. The emerging environmental priority of retaining as much as 90% of rain water on site becomes problematic with high percentages of impermeable surfaces. And since roads constitute the largest share of the total impermeable surfaces of a development, the difficulty <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> grid type of layout. For these reasons modern planners have attempted to modify the rigid, uniform, classic grid.|$|E

25|$|Two {{young men}} {{dominate}} the Comédie humaine: Lucien de Rubempré and Eugène de Rastignac. Both are talented but poor youths from the provinces, both attempt to achieve greatness in society through the intercession {{of women and}} both {{come into contact with}} Vautrin, but only Rastignac succeeds while Lucien de Rubempré ends his life by his own hand in a jail in Paris. The difference in outcome is partly explained by Balzac's views on heredity: Rastignac comes from a noble family, while only Rubempré's mother comes from a noble family (he had to obtain royal permission to use his mother's family name instead of his father's name Chardon). This deficit <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that his mother had not only married a commoner far beneath her in rank, but she had also performed menial labour to support herself when her husband died.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} some {{confusion}} about the biological effects of synephrine because of the similarity of this un-prefixed name to the names m-synephrine, Meta-synephrine and Neosynephrine, all of which refer to a related drug and naturally-occurring amine more commonly known as phenylephrine. Although there are chemical and pharmacological similarities between synephrine and phenylephrine, they are nevertheless different substances. The confusion <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that synephrine has been marketed as a drug under numerous different names, including Sympatol, Sympathol, Synthenate, and oxedrine, while phenylephrine has also been called m-Sympatol. The synephrine with which this article deals is {{sometimes referred to as}} p-synephrine in order to distinguish it from its positional isomers, m-synephrine and o-synephrine. A comprehensive listing of alternative names for synephrine may be found in the ChemSpider entry (see Chembox, at right). Confusion over the distinctions between p- and m-synephrine has even contaminated the primary research literature.|$|E
25|$|Roads are, {{by their}} nature, used by {{vehicles}} {{and it is}} clearly foreseeable that a person left lying on the road is {{at risk of being}} further injured by an inattentive driver. Hence, if A leaves B on the road with knowledge of that risk and a foreseeable event occurs, A remains the more proximate cause. This leaves whether the test of foresight should be subjective, objective or hybrid (i.e. both subjective and objective). Obviously, there is no difficulty in holding A liable if A had actual knowledge of the likelihood that B would be further injured by a driver. The fault which caused the initial injury <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> omission to move B to a safer place or call for assistance. But let us assume that A never averts the possibility of further injury. The issue is now the extent to which knowledge may be imputed objectively.|$|E

25|$|Mining {{presents}} a different problem, as the mines have been abandoned, but the pollution continues. Near Penistone, ochre discharged {{into the river}} from old ganister mine workings, giving it an orange colour for about six miles, eventually remedied, while at Beeley Wood, the ochre comes from a pile of waste metal on the river bank. A nearby paper mill {{has also been a}} significant polluter of the river. Some of the problem has been mitigated by the construction of lagoons, into which mine discharges have been diverted. Water quality on the Dearne and the Rother has not improved as much as on the Don, and pollution of the lower reaches <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that the pollutants, which include dioxins, are locked up in the river bed sediments. Despite the steady improvement in water quality, restocking of the river with fish, attempted on several occasions between 1981 and 1994, was largely ineffective, caused by intermittent discharges of pollutants. In November 2011, the Environment Agency announced that they had recently re-stocked the Don with 1,000 barbel. A spokesman said that the fish in the river were now at a sustainable level with a breeding population and these would be the last fish added as part of a 10-year programme to help the Don recover from an industrial heritage that had depleted fish stocks.|$|E
500|$|Because of its {{extended}} conversations, intricate {{descriptions and}} lengthy asides, {{the book is}} considered [...] "heavy" [...] by some critics. In later editions its chapter breaks were removed (though some versions now restore them), and the work is in three sections – the final of which comprises nearly half the novel. The novel's feel <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> lack of clarity on some points; some characters' motives are unclear even at the end, and the chaotic sequence of events is difficult to track.|$|E
500|$|The mayoral {{administration}} of the CUA is empowered to govern the city with de jure autonomy; {{a wide range of}} mechanisms have been established to facilitate governance, although they are of limited effectiveness. An urban master plan guides major policies for city management but personnel within the mayoral office commonly lack the urban planning and management ability to effectively implement the plan in response to long-term and immediate needs. This challenge <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> high turnover rate of mayors and staff that frequently disrupts initiatives begun by previous CUA administrations. A mayor under former president Didier Ratsiraka created [...] "red zones"; areas where public gathering and protests were prohibited. On 28 June 2001, Ravalomanana abolished these areas, liberalizing freedom of assembly.|$|E

500|$|Johnson {{was also}} known as a staunch Tory; he {{admitted}} to sympathies for the Jacobite cause during his younger years but, by the reign of George III, he came to accept the Hanoverian Succession. It was Boswell who gave people the impression that Johnson was an [...] "arch-conservative", and it was Boswell, more than anyone else, who determined how Johnson would be seen by people years later. However, Boswell was not around for two of Johnson's most politically active periods: during Walpole's control over British Parliament and during the Seven Years' War. Although Boswell was present with Johnson during the 1770s and describes four major pamphlets written by Johnson, he neglects to discuss them because he is more interested in their travels to Scotland. This <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> fact that Boswell held an opinion contradictory to two of these pamphlets, The False Alarm and Taxation No Tyranny, and so attacks Johnson's views in his biography.|$|E
500|$|German {{scholars}} such as Brigitte Schön and Gerald Willms have {{commented that}} rhetoric dominates public discourse around Scientology in Germany: in their view, efforts to [...] "frame" [...] information {{in such a way}} as to shape opinion have long been more important than the underlying realities. In Schön's words, this includes both the [...] "efforts of German politicians to enhance their popularity with strong-worded statements" [...] and [...] "Scientology's efforts to present itself as the victim of unjust persecution"; commenting on foreign reporting on Scientology in Germany, she adds that [...] "the American press may prefer sensationalist news to boring investigation and may frame the issue according to American stereotypes". Both Willms and Schön assert that the situation <b>is</b> <b>compounded</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> general paucity of scientific studies of Scientology. Schön as well as Irving Hexham, Professor of Religious Studies at the University of Calgary in Canada, have remarked in particular on the lack of academic studies by German scholars. Hexham attributes this situation to the strong influence of the Christian churches in Germany, which has made German academics wary of approaching the subject, because they fear repercussions for their research funding and for their prospects of future employment if they involve themselves in the debate.|$|E
