50|$|Distributed generation, also {{distributed}} energy, on-site generation (OSG) or district/decentralized {{energy is}} generated or stored {{by a variety}} of small, grid-connected devices referred to as distributed energy resources (DER) or <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> systems.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> at the distribution grid level creates concerns about their successful {{integration in the}} existing electric grid, designed for centralized generation by large power plants. Failure to the proper integration of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> might lead to violation of technical limits in the grid, thus lower power quality for the end-user, and reduces {{the efficiency of the}} electricity market. Nevertheless, the coexistence of generation and consumption at the premises of a neighborhood, caused by the increasing penetration of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> such as photovoltaic generators in the distribution grid, diminishes the power transmission losses, inherent to a grid based on central power generation. Moreover, it enables the creation of a local electricity market, a step towards the market and technical integration of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> if combined with the concept of market-based control. While market-based control seems to be the dominant solution for the control of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> the implementation of market-based control can be distributed or centralized and depends on the electricity market design. This work focuses on identifying the characteristics of the participants of the electricity market for the case study of residential customers with photovoltaic generation, residential energy storage and inelastic demand. Design choices are derived based on these characteristics in order to realize market-based control for the coordination of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> via an efficient local electricity market...|$|R

But increasing share of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> penetration in electric utilities poses a serious threat to the existing protection coordination schemes of the distribution systems. <b>Distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> connected distribution networks become interconnected in nature and protection coordination schemes, which are designed for unidirectional flow of fault currents become ineffective/non-functional.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper aims at {{modelling}} an electronically coupled <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> with {{an adaptive}} protection scheme. The electronically coupled <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> is a microgrid framework formed by coupling the {{renewable energy source}} electronically. Further, the proposed adaptive protection scheme provides a suitable protection to the microgrid for various fault conditions irrespective of the operating mode of the microgrid: namely, grid connected mode and islanded mode. The outstanding aspect of the developed adaptive protection scheme is that it monitors the microgrid and instantly updates relay fault current according to the variations {{that occur in the}} system. The proposed adaptive protection scheme also employs auto reclosures, through which the proposed adaptive protection scheme recovers faster from the fault and thereby increases the consistency of the microgrid. The effectiveness of the proposed adaptive protection is studied through the time domain simulations carried out in the PSCAD⧹EMTDC software environment...|$|E

40|$|Distribution {{systems are}} {{undergoing}} a dramatic {{transition from a}} passive circuit that routinely disseminates electric power among downstream nodes to the system with <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources.</b> The <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> {{come in a variety}} of technologies and typically include photovoltaic (PV) arrays, thermostatically controlled loads, energy storage units. Often these resources are interfaced with the system via inverters that can adjust active and reactive power injections, thus supporting the operational performance of the system. This paper designs a control policy for such inverters using the local power flow measurements. The control actuates active and reactive power injections of the inverter-based <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources.</b> This strategy is then incorporated into a chance-constrained, decentralized optimal power flow formulation to maintain voltage levels and power flows within their limits and to mitigate the volatility of (PV) resources...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—With {{increasing}} {{penetration of}} distributed genera-tion {{in the distribution}} networks (DN), the secure and optimal operation of DN has become an important concern. In this paper, an iterative quadratic constrained quadratic programming model to minimize voltage deviations and maximize <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> (DER) active power output in a three phase unbalanced distribution system is developed. The optimization model {{is based on the}} linearized sensitivity coefficients between controlled variables (e. g., node voltages) and control variables (e. g., real and reactive power injections of DERs). To avoid the oscillation of solution when it is close to the optimum, a golden search method is introduced to control the step size. Numerical simulations on modified IEEE 13 nodes test feeders show the efficiency of the proposed model. Compared to the results solved by heuristic search (harmony algorithm), the proposed model converges quickly to the global optimum.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the operation of}} the central controller for a microgrid. The central controller is responsible to maintain the voltage and frequency of the microgrid within the acceptable ranges while the <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> supply the required power demand of the loads based on the droop control. The desired ratio among the output active power of the <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources</b> is determined by the distribution network tertiary controller. To achieve a dynamic variation for the output active power ratios among the <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resources,</b> the central controller has to adjust the references of the rated active power and the droop control coefficients. As this may lead to unacceptable voltage and frequency in the microgrid, the central controller has to adjust the references of the voltage and frequency consequently. The proposed central controller strategy for the microgrid is validated through PSCAD/EMTDC simulations...|$|R

40|$|A key and {{important}} aspect of future power and energy systems is the integration of renewable and distributed energy resources. In order to develop, test and implement such distributed energy resources appropriate methods, procedures and guidelines are necessary. In 2009 a consortium of sixteen partners from industry and research started the DERri project (Distributed Energy Resources Research Infrastructures) to examine this issue. A special focus {{of the work in}} the DERi project is related to the improvement of simulation methods, with emphasis on the real-time domain, in order to support {{the development and implementation of}} DER devices. Currently no standardized modelling and simulation procedures as well as data formats for the exchange of realtime models exist; the DERri consortium has begun work on developing suitable exchange mechanisms. This paper presents and examines an approach to providing a standards-based model representation, especially for the real-time simulation of <b>distributed</b> <b>energy</b> <b>resource</b> devices. The main aim of this concept is the improvement of the exchange of model information and results from offline and realtime simulations between different research groups.

With this new methodology, the system operators can consider both the costs and voltage stability. Priority can be assigned to one objective function according to the operating scenario. Additionally, it is possible to evaluate the impact of the distributed generation and the electric vehicles in the management of voltage stability in the future electric networks.
