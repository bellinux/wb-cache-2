Using focal ionophoresis and pressure injections to apply glutamate and other agonists including NMDA, AMPA, and kainate to {{different regions of the}} neurons, he noticed that certain hot spots were <b>desensitized</b> more rapidly that other sites on the neuron. Fischbach and his collaborators hypothesized that these hot spots may be located at synapses between neurons, where clusters of glutamate receptors were present.|$|E
5|$|As {{with similar}} {{substances}} with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as barbiturates and benzodiazepines, withdrawal from alcohol dependence {{can be fatal}} {{if it is not}} properly managed. Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the GABAA receptor, promoting central nervous system depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are <b>desensitized</b> and reduced in number, resulting in tolerance and physical dependence. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled synapse firing. This can result in symptoms that include anxiety, life-threatening seizures, delirium tremens, hallucinations, shakes and possible heart failure. Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially dopamine, NMDA and glutamate.|$|E
5|$|Raskolnikov's dreams have a {{symbolic}} meaning, which suggests a psychological view. The {{dream of the}} mare being whipped has been suggested as the fullest single expression of the whole novel, symbolizing gratification and punishment, contemptible motives and contemptible society, depicting the nihilistic destruction of an unfit mare, the gratification therein, and Rodion's disgust and horror, {{as an example of}} his conflicted character. Raskolnikov's disgust and horror is central to the theme of his conflicted character, his guilty conscience, his contempt for society, his rationality of himself as an extraordinary man above greater society, holding authority to kill, and his concept of justified murder. His reaction is pivotal, provoking his first taking of life toward the rationalization of himself as above greater society. The dream is later mentioned when Raskolnikov talks to Marmeladov. Marmeladov's daughter, morally chaste and devout Sonya, must earn a living as a prostitute for their impoverished family, the result of his alcoholism. The dream is also a warning, foreshadowing an impending murder and holds several comparisons to his murder of the pawnbroker. The dream occurs after Rodion crosses a bridge leading out of the oppressive heat and dust of Petersburg and into the fresh greenness of the islands. This symbolizes a corresponding mental crossing, suggesting that Raskolnikov is returning to a state of clarity when he has the dream. In it, he returns to the innocence of his childhood and watches as a group of peasants beat an old mare to death. After Raskolnikov awakes, he reflects on it as a “such a hideous dream,” the same term he earlier used to describe his plot to kill the old woman (62). This diction draws a parallel between the two, suggesting that the child represents the part of him that clings to morality and watches horrified as another facet, represented by the peasants, is driven by hardship and isolation to become cold and unfeeling. The constant laughing of the peasants in the face of brutal slaughter reveals {{the extent to which they}} have been <b>desensitized</b> by their suffering, which is a reflection of Raskolnikov’s own condition. This interpretation is further supported by fact that the main peasant, Mikolka, feels that he has the right to kill the horse, linking his actions to Raskolnikov’s theory justifying murder for a select group of extraordinary men. The comparison between the cruel slaughter of the old mare and the plan to murder Alyona Ivanovna delineates the brutality of Raskolnikov’s crime, which is often downplayed by his habitual dehumanizing referral to the old woman as simply a “louse.” While awake, Raskolnikov’s view of the old woman is spiteful, defined by his tenacious belief in his extraordinary man theory. However, the dream acts as a conduit for Raskolnikov’s subconscious, and without the constraints of his theory the horrific nature of his crime becomes apparent. Therefore, in order for Raskolnikov to find redemption, he must ultimately renounce his theory.|$|E

40|$|AbstractObjectiveTooth {{sensitivity}} is a common, painful dental condition. Consumer dental products, mostly dentifrices, play {{an important}} role in sensitivity treatment. The objective of this review is to describe a new mouthwash-based <b>desensitizing</b> technology. DataBackground literature concerning <b>desensitizing</b> products is reviewed. Potassium salts are the most commonly used active ingredients in <b>desensitizing</b> dentifrices. Clinical studies show that while potassium salt dentifrices are generally effective; most formulations require several weeks to exert their <b>desensitizing</b> effect. Recently, a new <b>desensitizing</b> dentifrice containing the amino acid arginine was introduced. This dentifrice acts to occlude the dentinal tubules, and has been shown to be highly effective in multiple clinical studies. This arginine-containing dentifrice has also been shown to provide instant relief of sensitivity pain when applied directly to the sensitive tooth surface. In contrast to dentifrices, there are few <b>desensitizing</b> mouthwashes available. Building on the success of the arginine-based dentifrice, an arginine-based mouthwash formula was developed and tested. SourcesPublished studies in peer-reviewed publications. Study selectionControlled and blinded clinical studies to provide evidence of efficacy. In vitro studies are included to indicate the mechanism of action. This review includes studies testing the new arginine-based <b>desensitizing</b> mouthwash. ConclusionClinical findings indicate that this new <b>desensitizing</b> mouthwash, based on the Pro-Argin™ mouthwash technology effectively reduces sensitivity symptoms and can be used alone or as a adjunct to the use of the arginine-containing dentifrice in the home treatment of tooth sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|Currents {{activated}} by extracellular ATP were studied in single voltage- clamped bullfrog atrial cells. Rapid application of ATP elicited currents carried through two different conductance pathways: a rapidly <b>desensitizing</b> conductance reversing near - 10 mV, and a maintained, inwardly rectifying conductance reversing near - 85 mV. ATP activated the <b>desensitizing</b> component of current with a K 1 / 2 of approximately 50 microM and the maintained component with a K 1 / 2 of approximately 10 microM. Both types of current were {{activated by}} ATP {{but not by}} adenosine, AMP, or ADP. The <b>desensitizing</b> current was selectively inhibited by alpha, beta-methylene ATP, and the maintained, inwardly rectifying current was selectively suppressed by extracellular Cs. The <b>desensitizing</b> component of current was greatly reduced when extracellular Na was replaced by N-methylglucamine, but was slightly augmented when Na was replaced by Cs. GTP, ITP, and UTP were all ineffective in activating the <b>desensitizing</b> current, and {{of a variety of}} ATP analogues, only ATP-gamma-S was effective.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare {{in vitro}} the {{efficacy}} of five resin-based <b>desensitizing</b> agents at reducing human dentin permeability and to compare their cytotoxicity. The tested hypothesis was that their different curing techniques cause variations in efficiency and cytotoxicity. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dentin slices (0. 5 +/- 0. 05 mm thick) were prepared from human third molars (10 per group) and their hydraulic conductance was recorded before and after application {{of one of the}} <b>desensitizing</b> agents with a Flodec device. Six <b>desensitizing</b> agents were studied: one light curing agent (Seal and Protect); one self-curing agent (Pain Free); the resin-based agents without any polymerization initiator (Health-Dent, Gluma Desensitizer, Isodan); one oxalate-based agent served as a control (Protect). A MTT assay on L 929 fibroblasts was performed to measure the cytotoxicity of the six <b>desensitizing</b> agents applied onto additional dentin slices (10 per group). RESULTS: All the <b>desensitizing</b> agents resulted in a large decrease in dentin permeability. The best results were obtained with Gluma Desensitizer, Isodan, Pain Free and Protect. A statistically significant difference was found among the materials (P = 0. 001). All the materials were non-cytotoxic. Cell viability ranged from 88 % for Seal and Protect to 100 % for Isodan.

25|$|SSRIs prevent 5-HT from binding to SERT which {{prevents}} absorption of 5-HT {{back into the}} presynapse terminal, where it is metabolized by monoamine oxidase or stored in secretory vesicles. As a result, the 5-HT concentration increases at the somatodendritic area of the 5-HT neuron {{but not so much}} at the axon terminal area (demonstrated in figure 2). This increase in 5-HT concentration causes desensitization of somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors. When these 5-HT1A autoreceptors have been downregulated, they will no longer restrict the impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. The impulse flow is turned on and as a result 5-HT is released at the axon terminal. However, this increase of 5-HT does not happen quickly compared to the increase of 5-HT at the somatodendretic area of the 5-HT neuron. This delay is caused by the time it takes 5-HT to downregulate 5-HT1A autoreceptors and turn on the neuro impulse flow of the 5-HT neuron. This delay can explain the reason why antidepressants do not have effect on depression immediately. This can also be the reason why the antidepressant mechanisms can be connected to the increasing neuro impulse flow from 5-HT neurons, where as the concentration of 5-HT increases at the axon terminal before SSRIs start to work properly. When SSRIs have (1) inhibited the re-uptake pump, (2) increased somatodendritic 5-HT, (3) <b>desensitized</b> somatodendritic 5-HT1A autoreceptors, (4) turned on the impulse flow and (5) increased the release of 5-HT from axon terminal, the last step might be desensitization of postsynaptic 5-HT receptors. This desensitization could be the reason for reduction of adverse effects of SSRIs as tolerance develops.|$|E

However, there is concern regarding application effect of <b>desensitizing</b> agent on shear bond strength of the adhesive system used. The purpose of our study was to compare the shear bond strength of adhesive system in two different dentin surface treatments, with and without <b>desensitizing</b> agent. Sixteen extracted human premolars were sectioned off at the coronal portion to expose the flat dentin surfaces. The surfaces were finished using 600 Grit Wet Silicon Carbide abrasive papers.

The specimens were treated with one of four <b>desensitizing</b> agents: Bifluorid 12, Fluoridin, Thermoline and PrepEze. The remaining 20 specimens served as untreated controls. All groups were further divided into 2 subgroups in which a dual polymerized resin cement (Bifix QM) or a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (AVANTO) was used.
