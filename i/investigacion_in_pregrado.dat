The original publication is available at: [URL] role of biotic forcing in fluvial geomorphology is understudied. This paper investigates {{the suggestion that}} the activities of signal crayfish (Pacifastacus leniusculus) can increase suspended sediment fluxes in rivers. Previous field work, supported by mesocosm experiments, suggests that crayfish nocturnalism can cause night time increases in turbidity, but field data are limited to a 16 -hour period from a single site where suspended sediment time-series are not available. Here, field data collected over a 28 -day period on the Brampton Branch of the River Nene, UK, are used to quantify the impact of diel fluctuations in suspended sediment concentration on sediment fluxes. Field observations and laboratory experiments are used to evaluate the likelihood that crayfish, which are abundant in this river, are responsible for the diel patterns. Turbidity and water stage were measured at 2 -minute intervals at a single site. Water was sampled for suspended sediment concentration on a diel cycle and during storm events. A relation between suspended sediment concentration and turbidity, along with a local discharge time-series, permitted calculation of sediment flux and sediment loads. Aquarium experiments with one or two crayfish were used to directly observe the relative impacts of crayfish activity and conspecific interactions on sediment suspension. Over the 28 -day period, turbidity and suspended sediment exhibited a strong diel pattern, characterised by night-time increases in the frequency and magnitude of spikes in the turbidity data and by increases in ambient suspended sediment concentrations. Small diel fluctuations in stage were also measured, but the rises in stage were out of phase with turbidity and there was no correlation between stage and turbidity at any frequency. In the absence of a credible hydraulic explanation for the increases in night-time suspended sediment concentration, several lines of evidence, including results from the aquarium experiments, strongly suggest that crayfish are the most likely cause. We estimate that crayfish activity contributed at least 20...|$|R

40|$|The {{limits of}} copper homeostatic {{regulation}} in humans are not known, {{making it difficult}} to define the milder effects of early copper excess. Furthermore, a robust assay to facilitate the detection of early stages of copper excess is needed. To address these issues, we assessed changes in relative mRNA abundance of methallothionein 2 A (MT 2 A), prion (PrP), amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP 2), Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) and its copper chaperone (CCS) in peripheral mononuclear cells (PMNCs) from healthy adults representing the 5 % highest and lowest extremes in the distribution curve of serum ceruloplasmin (Cp) concentrations of 800 individuals. The intracellular Cu content was also determined. PMNCs were isolated from individuals before and after exposure to a single daily dose of 10 mg Cu (as CuSO 4) for 2 months. Results showed that although there were fluctuations in serum Cp values of the samples assessed before copper exposure, no significant differences were observed in cell copper content or in the relative abundance of MT 2 A, PrP and APLP 2 transcripts in PMNCs. Also, these values were not modified after copper supplementation. However, CCS and SOD 1 mRNA levels were reduced in PMNCs after copper supplementation in the individuals with the high Cp values, suggesting that they should be further explored as biomarkers of moderate copper overload in humans.

40|$|Due to {{the large}} {{potential}} of electroactive materials in novel tissue engineering strategies, {{the aim of this}} work is to determine if the crystalline phase and/or the surface electrical charge of electroactive poly(vinylidene fluoride), PVDF, have influence on the biological response in monolayer cell culture. Non-polar -PVDF and electroactive -PVDF were prepared. The -PVDF films were poled by corona discharge to show negative or positive electrical surface charge density. It has been concluded that hydrophilicity of the PVDF substrates depends significantly on crystalline phase and polarity. Further, by means of AFM and ELISA test {{it has been shown that}} positive or negative poling strongly influences the behaviour of -PVDF supports with respect to fibronectin adsorption, varying the exhibition of adhesion ligands of adsorbed fibronectin. Culture of MC 3 T 3 -E 1 pre-osteoeblasts proved that cell proliferation depends on surface polarity as well. These results open the viability of cell culture stimulation by mechanical deformation of a piezoelectric substrate that results in varying electrical charge densities on the substrate surface.

40|$|Poly(vinylidene fluoride) /Pb(Zr 0. 53 Ti 0. 47) O 3 ([PVDF] 1 −x/[PZT]x) {{composites}} {{of volume}} fractions x and (0 – 3) type connectivity were prepared {{in the form}} of thin films. The films were prepared by solvent casting with PZT powder of 0. 84, 1. 86, and 2. 35 μm average size with filler contents up to 40 % volume. The crystalline phase of the polymer matrix was the nonpolar α-phase and the polar β-phase. Dielectric measurements were performed in order to evaluate the influence of the filler size and content as well as the effect of the polymer matrix in the overall response of the material. No nucleation effect of any of the phases was observed for the used fillers. The spherulitic structure of the pure α-PVDF and the characteristic porosity of the β-phase material are destroyed for high PZT volume fractions. The inclusion of ceramic particles in the PVDF polymer matrix increases the complex dielectric constant of the composites independently of the PVDF polymer matrix. The dielectric properties of the composites are mainly affected by the amount of the ceramic particles. With respect to the relaxation processes of the polymer, the activation energy of the a-relaxation increases and the glass transition temperature decreases with increasing particle size and content. The high-temperature conductivity decreases with increasing filler content and there is an important contribution of the Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars effect to the overall dielectric response.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this investigation was}} to evaluate in vitro, the coronal microfiltration of two types of cements –zinc oxide-eugenol/silicone- using the obturation technique with lateral condensation. For this, 60 single-rooted teeth were used of recent extraction, to which the anatomical crown was sectioned to them; all the pieces were prepared crown-apical with gates-glidden drills and soon they were used Flex-o-file files with the step-back technique; the pieces were distributed at random in two groups: one of 30 pieces were obturated with cement sealant with zinc-eugenol oxide (ENDOFILL®) in conjunction with laterally condensed gutta-percha, and another group of 30 pieces were obturated with cement sealant with silicone (Roeko Seal Automix®) using the same technique. The samples were covered by varnish of nails in all the extension by the root, except in the coronal part and soon they were introduced in Chinese ink by 21 days for the entrance of the same one by passive filtration. The samples by fracture were sectioned to observe the coronal microfiltration of the Chinese ink, registering digital photographies of high precision. The coronal microfiltration was registered using the program Corel Draw X 3. In order to analyze the data statistically, the test was used t-student with which it determined that significant difference between the training groups exists One concludes that the teeth obturated with the cement sealant with silicone displayed minor coronal microfiltration, in degrees and millimeters, that the samples obturated with the cement sealant with zinc oxide - eugenol.
