Of course, when he did start to get brave, he was too old for going around and picking up what he might enjoy. He was the first of our mega stars; there seem to be mega stars everywhere now. In those days, living in such a Sleepy Hollow like Melbourne, he found his life terribly, terribly difficult. And you can understand in those days. The times have changed.

After {{the fall of}} the Crispi government {{as a result of the}} lost Battle of Adwa in March 1896, he served as the leader of the opposition conservatives against the liberal Giovanni Giolitti. In January 1897, Sonnino published an article titled Torniamo allo Statuto (Let's go back to the Statute), in which <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> the alarm about the threats that the clergy, republicans and socialists posed to liberalism. He called for the abolition of the system of parliamentary governments and the return of the royal prerogative to appoint and dismiss the Prime Minister without consulting parliament, as the only possible way to avert the danger. In 1901 he founded a new major newspaper, Il Giornale d'Italia.|$|E

500|$|After {{planning}} {{for over a}} year– largely in secret– Barrymore played his first Shakespeare part, the title role in Richard III. Conscious of the criticism of his vocal range, he underwent training with Margaret Carrington, the voice and diction trainer, to ensure <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> right for the part, and the pair worked together daily {{for up to six}} hours a day for six weeks. After the debut in March 1920, the critics were effusive in their praise. The Washington Herald observed that the audience were [...] "held by the sheer power of Barrymore's performance", which was [...] "remarkable for... unexpected vocal richness", while Woollcott, in The New York Times, thought the performance [...] "marked a measurable advance in the gradual process of bringing [...] technical fluency abreast with his winged imagination and his real genius for the theatre".|$|E
500|$|... "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] {{was written}} {{to replace the}} song [...] "We'll Make a Man of You" [...] after the film's {{original}} songwriter Stephen Schwartz departed from the project in favor of working on DreamWorks' The Prince of Egypt (1998). Prior to Mulan, Osmond had auditioned {{for the role of}} Hercules in Disney's Hercules (1997), a role for which he was ultimately turned down by the directors because they felt that <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> too old. Disney eventually cast Osmond as the singing voice of Shang because his singing voice is similar to Wong's speaking voice. An up-tempo military-style song, [...] "I'll Make a Man Out of You" [...] is performed by Shang during a rigorous training montage in which his young, inexperienced soldiers attempt to justify their worth. The song's title is considered ironic because Mulan, who relies on intelligence, ultimately proves more competent than her male comrades, including Captain Li Shang, who takes a liking to her.|$|E

Before Como could reply, Ted Weems spoke up, saying that Como was part of the session or it was over. By the time Como had been with Ted Weems about a year, he was mentioned in a 1937 Life magazine NBC Radio ad for Fibber McGee and Molly as [...] "causing cardiac flutters with his crooning." [...] The weekly radio show, Beat the Band, which ran on NBC from 1940 – 1944, was a [...] "stump the band" [...] type musical quiz show where Weems and his orchestra were the featured band from 1940 – 1941.|$|E

He would later claim that he {{intended}} the record as a gift for his mother, or that he was merely interested in what he [...] "sounded like", although there was a much cheaper, amateur record-making service at a nearby general store. Biographer Peter Guralnick argues that he chose Sun in the hope of being discovered. Asked by receptionist Marion Keisker what kind of singer he was, Presley responded, [...] "I sing all kinds." [...] When she pressed him on who <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> like, he repeatedly answered, [...] "I don't sound like nobody."

Explaining why he had called a local police station and not 999, Bamber told police on the night that he had not thought it would make a difference to how soon they would arrive. He said he had spent time looking up the number, and even though his father had asked him to come quickly, he had first telephoned his girlfriend, Julie Mugford, in London, then had driven slowly to the farmhouse. He acknowledged that he could have called one of the farm workers, but had not considered it. In his early witness statements, Bamber said he had telephoned the police immediately after receiving his father's call, then telephoned Mugford. During later police interviews, he said he had called Mugford first. He said he was confused about the sequence of events.|$|E

In addition, Dutt stated in an interview that he did not read Gandhi's autobiography My Experiments with Truth as a preparation for Lage Raho Munna Bhai. Rather, he comments, his father, Sunil Dutt (who portrays Munna Bhai's father in the first film, Munna Bhai M.B.B.S.) and his mother (the late actress Nargis) were his role models as they [...] "were basically Gandhians.

Bindi Sue is jointly named after two of Steve Irwin's favourite animals: Bindi, a saltwater crocodile, and Sui, a Staffordshire Bull Terrier who died on 23 June 2004. Irwin was as enthusiastic about his family as he was about his work. He once described his daughter Bindi as [...] "the reason [...] was put on the Earth." [...] His wife once said, [...] "The only thing that could ever keep him away from the animals he loves are the people he loves even more." [...] Although the Irwins were happily married, they did not wear wedding rings; they believed that in their line of work, wearing jewellery could pose a hazard to them and/or the animals.|$|E

[...] To create the episode's auditory effects, sound editor Bruce Tanis explained his production steps in an interview with Designing Sound, [...] "'Earthling' was a really good episode for strange sounds. It starts out with the appearance of a smoke monster that kills its victims by enveloping them and leaving behind an exact life-like looking corpse only the body is made of ash which crumbles horribly when touched. The smoke creature moved rapidly as opposed to gently drifting so I had some movement to play off of in creating a sound for him. I came up with some stuttering, fluttery whooshes that kind of vibrated which made him more dangerous than if <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> like a puff of steam moving along the hall. The smoke monster requires a host body to live in when he's not vibrating around killing people.

500|$|Azaria {{made his}} film {{debut in the}} direct-to-video release Cool Blue (1990), as Buzz. His first theatrically {{released}} feature film appearance came the same year in Pretty Woman, as a police detective. His next major film role was as television producer Albert Freedman in the 1994 film Quiz Show, which was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Picture. In 1996, Azaria played gay Guatemalan housekeeper Agador Spartacus in the film The Birdcage. For the role, which Azaria considers to be his [...] "big break", he was nominated for the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role, and critically branded [...] "the most hilarious performance in the film," [...] by Alison Macor of The Austin Chronicle, while Empire wrote that he [...] " [...] the show." [...] For the role he used a Guatemalan accent, and made himself sound as effeminate as possible. He had chosen two possible voices, an effeminate one and a tougher one. After advice from a drag queen, he chose the effeminate voice. Three weeks into production, he realized <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> exactly like his grandmother, which aided his performance. Agador was originally {{going to be a}} single scene part, with the larger role of the housekeeper being played by David Alan Grier. With the producers fearing the racial connotations of a black actor in such a part, Azaria inherited the full role.|$|E
500|$|In {{his first}} year with Dorsey, Sinatra {{recorded}} over forty songs. Sinatra's first vocal hit was the song [...] "Polka Dots and Moonbeams" [...] in late April 1940. Two more chart appearances followed with [...] "Say It" [...] and [...] "Imagination", which was Sinatra's first top-10 hit. His fourth chart appearance was [...] "I'll Never Smile Again", topping the charts for twelve weeks beginning in mid-July. Other records with Tommy Dorsey issued by RCA Victor include [...] "Our Love Affair" [...] and [...] "Stardust" [...] in 1940; [...] "Oh!

As his success and popularity grew, Sinatra pushed Dorsey {{to allow him to}} record some solo songs. Dorsey eventually relented, and on January 19, 1942, Sinatra recorded [...] "Night and Day", [...] "The Night We Called It a Day", [...] "The Song is You" [...] and [...] "Lamplighter's Serenade" [...] at a Bluebird recording session, with Axel Stordahl as arranger and conductor. Sinatra first heard the recordings at the Hollywood Palladium and Hollywood Plaza and was astounded at how good <b>he</b> <b>sounded.</b> Stordahl recalled: [...] "He just couldn't believe his ears. He was so excited, you almost believed he had never recorded before. I think this was a turning point in his career. I think he began to see what he might do on his own".|$|E
500|$|By early 1955, Presley's regular Hayride appearances, {{constant}} touring, and well-received record releases {{had made}} him a regional star, from Tennessee to West Texas. In January, Neal signed a formal management contract with Presley and brought the singer {{to the attention of}} Colonel Tom Parker, whom he considered the best promoter in the music business. Having successfully managed top country star Eddy Arnold, Parker was now working with the new number-one country singer, Hank Snow. Parker booked Presley on Snow's February tour. When the tour reached Odessa, Texas, a 19-year-old Roy Orbison saw Presley for the first time: [...] "His energy was incredible, his instinct was just amazing.... I just didn't {{know what to make of}} it. There was just no reference point in the culture to compare it." [...] Presley made his television debut on March 3 on the KSLA-TV broadcast of Louisiana Hayride. Soon after, he failed an audition for Arthur Godfrey's Talent Scouts on the CBS television network. By August, Sun had released ten sides credited to [...] "Elvis Presley, Scotty and Bill"; on the latest recordings, the trio were joined by a drummer. Some of the songs, like [...] "That's All Right", were in what one Memphis journalist described as the [...] "R idiom of negro field jazz"; others, like [...] "Blue Moon of Kentucky", were [...] "more in the country field", [...] "but there was a curious blending of the two different musics in both". This blend of styles made it difficult for Presley's music to find radio airplay. According to Neal, many country-music disc jockeys would not play it because <b>he</b> <b>sounded</b> too much like a black artist and none of the rhythm-and-blues stations would touch him because [...] "he sounded too much like a hillbilly." [...] The blend came to be known as rockabilly. At the time, Presley was variously billed as [...] "The King of Western Bop", [...] "The Hillbilly Cat", and [...] "The Memphis Flash".|$|E
