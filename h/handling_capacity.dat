5|$|A$330million {{expansion}} programme for Terminal 2 {{was announced}} in 2007 and was completed in 2012. The objectives of this project include new lounges and retail facilities, a new satellite terminal, increased luggage capacity and a redesign of customs and security areas. A new satellite terminal features floor-to-ceiling windows offers views of the North-South runway. The new concourse includes three double-decker aerobridges which are gates 16, 18 and 20, each accommodating an A380 aircraft or two smaller aircraft and one single aerobridge. The baggage <b>handling</b> <b>capacity</b> will be increased, and two new baggage carousels will cater to increased A380 traffic. Work commenced in November 2007 and will be completed in 2011 but was opened in 2012.|$|E
5|$|The A4 {{motorway}} is {{a significant}} northsouth motorway in the northern Croatia connecting the nation's capital, Zagreb, to the Hungarian M7 motorway at the Goričan border crossing The southern terminus of the A4 motorway at the interchange in Ivanja Reka represents its junction {{with the rest of}} the Croatian motorway network via the A3 motorway. As a part of the road network of Croatia, the motorway is a part of European route E65 and European route E71. The motorway is of major importance to Croatia in terms of the development of its economy, notably tourism, as it represents the shortest and the most comfortable route between Budapest, Hungary and the Adriatic Sea. This particularly applies to tourist resorts on the Istria and Kvarner Gulf islands and to the Port of Rijeka, but it is also true for resorts in the Dalmatia region, served via the A1 motorway. The genuine importance of the motorway as a transit route will be demonstrated upon completion of the proposed expansion of the Port of Rijeka and Rijeka transport node. This expansion is planned to encompass the growth of the Port of Rijeka's cargo <b>handling</b> <b>capacity,</b> improved railroad links and a new Rijeka bypass motorway linking the A6, via a new interchange, to the present routes of the A7 and A8 motorways. The project is, among other goals, aimed to increase traffic along the Croatian part of Pan-European corridor Vb, of which the A4 motorway is a part.|$|E

40|$|International audienceIntracellular {{partitioning}} of {{trace metals}} {{is critical to}} metal detoxification in aquatic organisms. In the present study, we assessed metal (Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn) <b>handling</b> <b>capacities</b> of mummichogs () in metal-polluted salt marshes in New York, USA by examining metal intracellular partitioning. Despite the lack of differences in the whole body burdens, partitioning patterns of metals in intracellular components (heat-stable proteins, heat-denaturable proteins, organelles, and metal-rich granules) revealed clear differential metal <b>handling</b> <b>capacities</b> among the populations of mummichogs. In general, mummichogs living in metal-polluted sites stored {{a large amount of}} metals in detoxifying cellular components, particularly metal-rich granules (MRG). Moreover, only metals associated with MRG were consistently correlated with variations in the whole body burdens. These findings suggest that metal detoxification through intracellular partitioning, particularly the sequestration to MRG, may have important implications for metal tolerance of mummichogs living in chronically metal-polluted habitats...|$|R

40|$|This paper characterises {{smallholder}} milk {{outlets in}} Nakuru district {{one of the}} major milk producing Districts in Kenya, and also analyses factors that influence their current operating and <b>handling</b> <b>capacities.</b> Data comes from four divisions of the district. A sample of 137 smallholder milk retail outlets was made using systematic random sampling methodology. Both descriptive and ordinary regression methods were used in the analysis. A characterisation of the retail outlets is brought out and the factors that affect their current operating capacities presented. Results show that a unit change in education, experience and selling prices leads to 0. 29, 0. 18 and 0. 23 significant changes in milk <b>handling</b> <b>capacities</b> by the retail outlets respectively. These imply that there is an efficiency gain from education and better prices through higher consumer incomes in the industry. Enhancement of milk retailers' value addition through provision of physical facilities such as cooling equipment and stability in prices should be encouraged through policy intervention to promote informal sector investments in the sub-sector. milk supply chain, smallholder retail outlets, Kenya, Industrial Organization, Marketing,...|$|R

25|$|Rated Power– Nominal (or even continuous) power, and peak (or maximum short-term) power a {{loudspeaker}} can handle (i.e., maximum input power before destroying the loudspeaker; {{it is never}} the sound output the loudspeaker produces). A driver may be damaged at much less than its rated power if driven past its mechanical limits at lower frequencies. Tweeters can also be damaged by amplifier clipping (amplifier circuits produce large amounts of energy at high frequencies in such cases) or by music or sine wave input at high frequencies. Each of these situations might pass more energy to a tweeter than it can survive without damage. In some jurisdictions, power handling has a legal meaning allowing comparisons between loudspeakers under consideration. Elsewhere, the variety of meanings for power <b>handling</b> <b>capacity</b> can be quite confusing.|$|E

40|$|The {{dimensioning}} {{of appropriate}} process equipment and material <b>handling</b> <b>capacities</b> for wafer fabs {{by means of}} simulation technique demands for an accurate prediction of the operational fab behavior. In order to get reliable data of maximum WIP and throughput of the fab, {{the implementation of the}} most crucial constraints and dispatching policies of the shop floor in the simulation model is an important prerequisite. This in turn is the information which is necessary for the fab design such as to designate storage capacities. Hence, future dispatching strategies should already be considered when performing simulation studies for the determination of process equipment capacities and the dimensioning of material handling systems. This gains even more importance for complex make-to-order manufacturing environments with a large quantity of process flows and strongly varying production orders. The paper points out the requirements of simulation models which are needed for an accurate analysis of process equipment and material <b>handling</b> <b>capacities</b> for highly complex wafer fabrication, especially in make-to-order manufacturing environment.
