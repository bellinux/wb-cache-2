However, with irrigation from the Colorado River, this area has become truly an agricultural center. The Cerro Prieto <b>geothermal</b> <b>province</b> is near Mexicali as well (this area is geologically {{part of a large}} pull apart basin); producing about 80% of the electricity consumed in the state and enough more to export to California. Laguna Salada, a saline lake below sea level lying between the rugged Sierra de Juarez and the Sierra de los Cucapah, is also in the vicinity of Mexicali. The state government has recently been considering plans to revive Laguna Salada. The highest mountain in the Sierra de los Cucapah is the Cerro del Centinela or Mount Signal.

Also, various other geo-scientific investigations followed consisting of geological, geochemical and shallow geophysical studies, which altogether highlight {{the significance of this}} region (Azeez and Harinarayana 2007).

30|$|It is {{well known}} that the major <b>geothermal</b> <b>provinces</b> are located at {{structurally}} favorable settings dominated by step-over/transferring, overlapping, or terminating normal faults. They are preferably striking parallel to the maximum horizontal stress (Faulds et al. 2011). The majority of the Molasse basin fault zones identified are ENE-WSW-trending normal faults (Lemcke 1988). In relation to the roughly N-S-oriented maximum horizontal stress (Reinecker et al. 2010), the N-S or NNE-SSW (approximately N 30 °E)-oriented fracture systems show a high tendency to develop tensile or shearing character. Recent seismic investigations revealed inhomogeneities near normal faults, which may {{have a significant impact on}} the hydraulic properties of the reservoir (Lueschen et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Our {{studies and}} those of our colleagues in Idaho {{indicate}} that the western Snake River Basin is a major <b>geothermal</b> <b>province,</b> {{similar in some ways}} to the Imperial Valley <b>Geothermal</b> <b>Province.</b> Deep drilling should encounter high temperature fluids in permeable rocks below 2 km and at shallower depths where permeability has developed, as along faults and fracture zones. The Cow Hollow area seems to have the necessary conditions for a high-temperature geothermal reservoir: high heat flow, permeable rocks at depth, and a barrier to migration or trap. Prior to drilling a deep exploratory well, more geologic and geophysical work and more detailed structural geologic studies should be done, more heat-flow holes should be drilled, and additional gravity and magnetic surveys should be done. In addition, some geochemical electrical resistivity, and seismic studies should be made to further define the anomaly. After these more definitive investigations are made, the only sure method of determining if geothermal fluids exist in commercial quantities is to drill enough wells to define the base temperature and production capabilities of the reservoir...|$|E

The area is characterized by high heat flow and high geothermal gradient and hosts several thermal and warm springs whose chemistry indicates a high temperature reservoir within the granites. The geophysical data indicated that the thermal fluids are fault controlled. The residence time of the fluids, estimated based on C- 14, is about 33 kilo years. Oxygen isotope shift suggests that the reservoir temperature is around 220 degrees C. It is estimated that the province can generate electricity {{of the order of}} 134 x 10 (6) kW h which can be effectively utilized to meet future fresh water demand and save CO 2 emissions by decreasing the domestic oil and gas consumption.

40|$|International audienceThe need to {{understand}} the geological context of the Bouillante <b>geothermal</b> <b>Province</b> (Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, French West Indies) has led to numerous onshore and offshore geophysical investigations. This work presents a compilation of all available, subaerial and marine, gravity and magnetic, electric and magnetotelluric data acquired during the last 30 years. Oldest electric and magnetotelluric data were digitalized from manuscripts (area of interest from Mahaut to Basse-Terre). Although we faced different problems related to missing acquisition parameters, we partially reconstruct MT tensors to provide a qualitative interpretation of resistivity distribution at depth. The previous interpretations have been improved and evidenced well developed conductive anomalies overlying more resistive ones at the location of, but also beyond, the geothermal field area. The large-scale gravity signal (from Montserrat to La Dominique) is used to explore existence and geometry of deep dense intrusive complexes beneath La Soufrière and the Bouillante Chain (if existing) volcanoes which could be interpreted as heat sources for the geothermal systems. Modelling has been initiated to constrain the geometry of such structures together with the distribution of more or less dense products both onshore and offshore. Because Guadeloupe volcanism spars the Brunhes-Matuyama geomagnetic reversal (0. 78 Ma), analysis of magnetic anomalies highlight areas predominantly composed of formations either younger or older than the reversal. Modeling is used to reconstruct a generalized topography of the island at 0. 78 Ma. The detailed analysis of the offshore magnetic lineaments will be tentatively used {{to understand}} the inheritance of the lithosphere structure in the island evolution. An updated large-scale model of the geothermal system will be proposed based on geological constraints and previous geophysical interpretations. This synthesis could act as a guide in the implantation of upcoming surveys in order to better constrain the Bouillante <b>geothermal</b> <b>Province,</b> and to improve the knowledge the island evolution as a whole.

30|$|To {{understand}} {{the circulation of}} the water through the Gugi granite, we conducted water-rock interaction experiment for selected granite samples. The granite samples were crushed to < 1  mm. The water-rock interaction experiment {{was carried out in}} a glass chamber with fluid/solid ratio of 10 : 1 at 100 °C. Rainwater was utilized in the experiment as the interacting fluid. Water-rock interaction experiment with samples derived from the granites shows wide range of geochemical variation. Most of them fall in the Na-SO 4 field (Singh et al. [2012]), while the thermal springs and the surface waters fall in the Ca-HCO 3 field (Figure  5). It indicates circulation of meteoric water within the granites (host of the thermal reservoir) and emerging through the Deccan Basalt flows, after mixing with the near-surface groundwater and thus becoming rich in Ca-HCO 3 component. It further strengthens our earlier view (Chandrasekharam and Chandrasekhar [2010]) that the granites are the main source of heat for the thermal springs in several <b>geothermal</b> <b>provinces</b> of India.|$|R

30|$|At {{the present}} time, {{we do not}} have clear {{geologic}} evidence to adopt a variable heat-flow model. Therefore, we adopted a constant heat-flow model for the whole modeling period, which extended from the Cretaceous to the present, as the first step of the modeling process. Scarce volcanic material in the sedimentary units in Urakawa implies that the <b>geothermal</b> <b>province</b> of the inner arc was far from our study area during the analyzed period; hence, present-day data of 40  mW/m 2 that were calculated on the basis of temperature logging and thermal conductivity records at a drilling site in central Hokkaido (Tamaki et al. 2009) were adopted for use in this study. As for the Kitakawaguchi SK- 1 and MITI Rumoi, a constant value of 48  mW/m 2 (20 % higher than Urakawa) was adopted through the consideration of prolonged igneous activities within the adjacent Rebun-Kabato Belt.|$|E
40|$|The {{west coast}} <b>geothermal</b> <b>province</b> in Maharashtra hosts {{a number of}} thermal springs along the 350 km linear stretch. Major and trace element {{analyses}} of thermal springs from 15 locations along with groundwater and surface water samples have been studied. The thermal waters had temperatures ranging from 40 to 71 degrees C, pH from 7. 1 to 8. 8 and total dissolved solids between 337 and 8698 mg/l. Most of the thermal waters are Na-Ca-Cl or Ca-Na-Cl type except one which is of Na-HCO 3 type. The major ion data is comparable over three decades suggesting a mature geothermal system in the west coast. Trace elements concentrations were low in case of some elements such as< 0. 1 ppb of Ag and Cd, 1 - 3 ppb of Cr, Zn, Co, Cu, Pb and Ni, whereas elements like Li (19 - 386 ppb), B (104 - 1362 ppb), Sr (16 - 13, 560 ppb), Rb (13 - 220 ppb), Cs (0. 75 - 44 ppb) and Ba (3 - 2077 ppb) were much higher in concentration.

40|$|Cappadocia <b>Geothermal</b> <b>Province</b> (CGP), central Turkey, {{consists}} of nine individual geothermal regions controlled by active regional fault systems. This paper examines the age dating of alteration minerals and the geochemistry (trace elements and isotopes) of the alteration minerals and geothermal waters, {{to assess the}} evolution of CGP in relation to regional tectonics. Ar-Ar age data of jarosite and alunite show that the host rocks were exposed to oxidizing conditions near the Earth 2 ̆ 7 s surface at about 5. 30 Ma. Based on the delta O- 18 -delta D relationhip, water samples had a high altitude meteoric origin. The delta S- 34 values of jarosite and alunite indicate that water samples from {{the southern part of}} the study area reached the surface after circulation through volcanic rocks, while northern samples had traveled to the surface after interacting with evaporates at greater depths. REY (rare earth elements and yttrium) diagrams of alteration minerals (especially illite, jarosite and alunite) from rock samples, taken from the same locations as the water samples, display a similar REY pattern to water samples. This suggests that thermal fluids, which reached the surface along a fault zone and caused the mineral alteration in the past, had similar chemical composition to the current geothermal water. The geothermal conceptual model, which defines a volcanically heated reservoir and cap rocks, suggests there are no structural drawbacks to the use of the CGP geothermal system as a resource. However, fluid is insufficient to drive the geothermal system as a result of scanty supply of meteoric water due to evaporation significantly exceeding rainfall...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} {{we show that}} the main springs of the central Apennine {{transport}} a total amount of heat of ∼ 2. 2 109 J s− 1. Most of this heat (57 %) {{is the result of}} geothermal warming while the remaining 43 % is due to gravitational potential energy dissipation. This result indicates that a large area of the central Apennines is very hot with heat flux values 4300 mWm− 2. These values are higher than those measured in the magmatic and famously <b>geothermal</b> <b>provinces</b> of Tuscany and Latium and about 1 / 3 of the total heat discharged at Yellowstone. This finding is surprising because the central Apennines have been thought to be a relatively cold area. Translated by CO 2 rich fluids, this heat anomaly suggests the existence of a thermal source such as a large magmatic intrusion at depth. Recent tomographic images of the area support the presence of such an intrusion visible as a broad negative velocity anomaly in seismic waves. Our results indicate that the thermal regime of tectonically active areas of the Earth, where meteoric waters infiltrate and deeply circulate, should be revised on the basis of mass and energy balances of the groundwater systems...|$|R
40|$|Surface {{features}} {{observed on}} Mars and evidence from martian meteorites both suggest that hydrothermal systems have operated in the crust of the planet. Hydrothermal systems are a potential habitat for living organisms and identifying these on Mars is, therefore, {{important in the}} search for life beyond the Earth. One of the surface expressions of hydrothermal systems on Earth are silica sinters, deposited during the cooling of hydrothermal solutions. In this paper we present analyses of the mineralogy, textures, chemistry and organic chemistry of silica sinters from two very different <b>geothermal</b> <b>provinces,</b> Waiotapu, New Zealand and Haukadalur, Iceland, in order to determine common features by which silica sinters can be identified. Infrared reflectance spectroscopy was utilised in combination with textural studies to evaluate the mineralogy of sinter deposits in terms of the abundances of different polymorphs of SiO 2. Concentrations of organic molecules, principally lipids, within regions of the sinters in which there is textural evidence for micro-organisms were identified in the infrared spectral data and their presence was confirmed using gas chromatography mass spectroscopy. The results {{of this study indicate that}} reflectance spectra in the wavelength region from 2. 5 to 14 μm, when calibrated against natural terrestrial analogues, can be used to identify silica sinters, as well as the possible presence of recent microbial communities on Mars...|$|R

40|$|Bouillante {{geothermal}} field (Basse-Terre, Guadeloupe, French West Indies) is {{located near the}} Western coast of Guadeloupe Island, about 15 km from the presently active Soufrière volcano. We have studied the subsurface structure of a zone encompassing the geothermal area using geophysical data. The {{need to understand the}} geological context of the Bouillante <b>geothermal</b> <b>Province</b> has led to numerous onshore and offshore geophysical investigations. This work presents a compilation of all available, subaerial and marine, gravity and magnetic, electric and magnetotelluric data acquired during the last 30 years. To the first order, this synthesis could act as a guide in the implantation of upcoming surveys in order to better constrain the Bouillante <b>geothermal</b> <b>Province,</b> and to improve the knowledge the island evolution as a whole. Oldest electric and magnetotelluric data were digitalized from manuscripts. Although we faced different problems related to missing acquisition parameters, we partially reconstruct MT tensors to provide a qualitative interpretation of resistivity distribution at depth. Geophysical models have been initiated based on geological constraints and previous geophysical interpretations. We are able to differentiate structures pre- and post-dating the different magnetic inversions using the magnetic measurements according to the polarity of the anomalies. The gravity measurements are used to detect and characterise the dense complexes from the low dense areas, allowing us to complete the magnetic measurements in regard {{of the nature of the}} Bouillante Chain formations. The electromagnetic surveys allow us to determine the distribution of electrical resistivities which we interpret in terms of water saturation of rocks, hydrothermal alteration and the presence of hydrated mineral. The integration of the geophysical results has allowed us to build up an updated model of the geothermal system based on geological constraints and previous geophysical interpretations. At the scale of the Province of geothermal Bouillante, the previously proposed conceptual model is clarified through a formations layering associated with petrophysical parameters (density, magnetization, resistivity), in agreement with the classical scheme of geothermal reservoirs. The distribution of resistivities in depth highlights the succession of resistive-conductive-resistive layers, classic in volcanic field. The shallow resistant is relatively well explain in terms of massive formations, dense (not affected by hydrothermal alteration) and recent, associated with the Axial Chain or Chain Bouillante. The conductive intermediate layer marks the intermediate clay cover (cap rock) of the geothermal system, associated with low dense and demagnetized rocks altered by hydrothermal action (at least in the productive areas recognized on the surface). The deep resistive layer is associated with dense formations, older according to depth (oldest formations of the Axial Chain or lava flows from the northern chain). This latter could correspond to the deep geothermal reservoir whose morphology and extension are discussed. Based on our geophysical data and modeling, the geothermal activity could be more developed toward the north compared to the previously proposed extension. Moreover, a major volcano-structural control is evident on various configurations of the {{geothermal field}}. The various faults recognized in this key sector seem to affect significantly the internal structure of the Province of Bouillante, and consequently the development of geothermal activity. The horst and graben structure in conditions undoubtedly the morphology of the clay cover and operation of the field.

40|$|Integrated {{geophysical}} surveys using vertical electrical sounding (VES), {{very low}} frequency (VLF) EM, radiation counting, total magnetic field and self-potential (SP) measurements are carried out to characterize the geothermal area around a hot spring in the Nayagarh district, Orissa, India that lies in the East Indian <b>geothermal</b> <b>province.</b> The study was performed to delineate the fracture pattern, contaminated groundwater movement and possible heating source. VES interpretations suggest a three- to four-layer structure in the area. Resistivity survey near the hot spring suggests that weathered and fractured formations constitute the main aquifer system and extend to 60 m depth. Current flow measured at various electrode separations normalized by the applied voltage suggests that fractures extend to a greater depth. Detailed VLF study shows that fractures extend beyond 70 m depth. VLF anomaly has also very good correlation with the total magnetic field measured along the same profiles. Study results suggest that a gridded pattern of VLF survey could map the underground conductive fracture zones that can identify the movement of contaminated groundwater flow. Therefore, precautionary measures {{can be taken to}} check further contamination by delineating subsurface conducting structures. Self potential (SP) measured over the hot spring does not show a large anomaly in favor of the presence of a sulphide mineral body. A small positive (5 – 15 mV) SP anomaly is measured which may be streaming potential due to subsurface fluid flow. A high radiation is measured about four kilometers from the hot spring, suggesting possible radiogenic heating. However, the exact nature of the heating source and its depth is not known in the area. Deep resistivity followed by a magneto-telluric survey could reveal the deeper structures...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Bouillante {{high-temperature}} {{geothermal field}} (Guadeloupe, French Lesser Antilles) {{is located on}} the west coast of Basse-Terre Island, about 15 km from the currently active Soufrière volcano. We have studied the shallow structure of the geothermal zone using a compilation of all available gravity, magnetic and resistivity data, both subaerial and marine, acquired during the last 30 years. Geophysical models have been developed based on geological constraints and previous geophysical interpretations. The resistivity distribution from electromagnetic surveys is interpreted in terms of water saturation of rocks, hydrothermal alteration and presence of hydrated minerals. Gravity is used to distinguish and characterize the denser formations from the low density areas. Finally, we are able to differentiate structures which pre- and post-date various recent magnetic inversions using the polarity of the magnetic anomalies. By integrating these results the previous conceptual model for the <b>geothermal</b> <b>province</b> has been improved, with the layering of the geological formations as defined by geophysical parameters now being taken into account, in agreement with the classical scheme of geothermal reservoirs. The shallow resistive layer is explained in terms of recent massive formations. The conductive intermediate layer marks the low density, demagnetized clay cover of the altered geothermal system. The deep resistive layer is associated with dense formations increasing in age with depth, and corresponds to the deep geothermal reservoir. Based on our geophysical data, the geothermal activity could be more developed towards the east and north compared to the previously proposed area. A volcano-structural control seems to affect the internal structure of the province, and consequently the development of geothermal activity.

The work is the result of synergistic activity between the classical regional geology and the analytical processing methods typical of the geostatistics and geological. The main objective was to reconstruct, on the basis of available data, the Variscan top surface, preceding the pre-Alpine sedimentary cycle (Upper Carboniferous - Permian) and the Alpine properly Mesozoic and Tertiary, over an area covering the italian peninsula and the Adriatic Sea. The integration of surface geology with the underground information and the interpreted seismic reflection data has been the base of the computation, first on small scale using geostatistical tools and then on large scale with the development of a detailed 3 D geologic volume model detail in a geothermal area of ​​Tuscany. The geostatistical processing has produced a series of maps on a national scale relating to the depth of the investigated surface. Available crustal seismic profile were used to this aim, and the first reconstruction was done in the time domain. Then, the velocity was calibrated using subsurface information from deep weel stratigraphy, and the obtained model were used to obtain the surface depth values. The 3 D geological model constructed on the basis of subsurface data, widespread in the Tuscan <b>geothermal</b> <b>provinces,</b> has instead highlighted the volumes and geometric relationships between the various rocks taken into account, and defined in detail the shape of the Variscan surface. The resulting degree of confidence in the results is uneven, depending on the data distribution of subsurface information from weels.

40|$|International audienceMost {{previous}} geodynamic studies treat subduction zones with backward migration (rollback), slab tearing or slab breakoff by numerical {{or laboratory}} experiments and by integrating seismicity, tomography data and geochemical studies. Here we investigate these {{processes in the}} Aegean-Anatolian domain and particularly {{the western side of}} Turkey (western Anatolia) by incorporating thermal regime of the crust, and in particular the geothermal fields as anomalies that could reflect the thermal state of Aegean subduction zone at depth. This domain is characterized by 1) extensional crustal deformation which progressively localized during the Aegean slab retreat from late Eocene to Present, enabling the development of a hot backarc domain; this extension accelerated between 15 and 8 Ma coeval with a fast rotation of the Hellenides and 2) since the latest Miocene, extension is coupled with the development of the North Anatolian Fault that accommodates the westward escape of the Anatolian block. Both the acceleration of extension in the Middle Miocene and the recent escape of Anatolia have been proposed to result from several slab tearing events, the first one being located below western Turkey and the Eastern Aegean Sea, a second one below eastern Turkey and a last one below the Corinth Rift (Faccenna et al., 2006; Jolivet et al., 2013). The distribution of magmatism and mineral resources has been suggested to be largely controlled by these retreat and tearing events (Menant et al., submitted). The development of a widespread active <b>geothermal</b> <b>province</b> in western Anatolia is unlikely to simply result from the Quaternary magmatism whose volcanism part has a too limited extent. Conversely, the long wavelength east-west variation of surface heat flow density could reflect deep thermal processes in the lower crust and/or deeper, and we thus look for possible connections with larger-scale mantle dynamics. We use the distribution of thermal anomalies at different scales and the 3 D shape of the Aegean slab to discuss mantle and crustal dynamics. In order to constrain the development and the propagation of slab tears during subduction beneath western Anatolia, we used spatial and temporal data on magmatic activity, geochemical signatures of this activity (e. g. increase of mantle source component), seismic tomography models and seismicity data. We also discuss the origin of the thermal anomalies propagating {{all the way to the}} surface, whether they relate to deep-seated mantle processes only (western Anatolia, Turkey) or to more superficial volcanic processes above a hot mantle like in Central and Eastern Anatolia...|$|E
