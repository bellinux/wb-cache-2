Salvador Dalí, who was in New York to attend the MoMA opening, was present at its first screening. During the screening, Dalí became outraged at Cornell's movie, claiming he had <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> same idea of applying collage techniques to film. After the screening, Dalí remarked to Cornell that he should stick to making boxes and stop making films. Traumatized by this event, the shy, retiring Cornell showed his films rarely thereafter.|$|E

He first pitched this episode at a story retreat to Al Jean and Mike Reiss, who said the episode was a little crazy and thought he should try some other material first. O'Brien had previously pitched episodes where Lisa had a rival and where Marge gets a job at the power plant and Mr. Burns falls in love with her; both went well. James L. Brooks [...] "absolutely loved" [...] this episode when O'Brien presented it.|$|E

[...] He then shifted to opposing the war: [...] "I no longer {{believe that it was}} necessary for us to get involved in South Vietnam to stop Communist aggression in Southeast Asia." [...] Decrying the [...] "tragic" [...] conflict, he urged [...] "a sound peace in South Vietnam at an early time." [...] Thus Romney disavowed the war and reversed himself from his earlier stated belief that the war was [...] "morally right and necessary".|$|E

500|$|With {{the club}} failing {{to live up}} to its high {{spending}} potential, Ford became a target for doubters due to his physical playing style and his arguments with teammate and former record-breaking signing, Len Shackleton. During a match against Chelsea in February 1952, Ford scored a first-half hat-trick during the match as the Mackems found themselves 4–0 up at half-time, Shackleton having also scored. In the second- half of the match, Shackleton was believed to have [...] "switched off" [...] as he considered the match already won, leaving Ford to largely play up-front on his own against the opposition defense, resulting in a frustrated Ford to claim to members of the local press after the game that Shackleton never deliberately passed to him during games. Things became so heated between the pair that, during a friendly match against a Netherlands B side, Shackleton dribbled past the opposition goalkeeper before stopping on the goal-line and passing the ball back to Ford before commenting [...] "Here, don't say I never give you a pass" [...] in reference to Ford's displeasure at his belief that Shackleton would play the ball in areas Ford did not want it. Billy Bingham, who played alongside the pair at Sunderland, later commented [...] "He (Ford) never seemed to know what Shackleton was going to do with the ball and subsequently Trevor believed that Shackleton was ignoring him on the field of play". Stan Anderson, another former teammate of the pair, believed that Shackleton was jealous of Ford's perceived good looks and also supported Ford's claims of Shackleton deliberately misplacing passes to Ford on at least one occasion, commenting [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> feeling he (Shackleton) never wanted Trevor to score, which made me really angry".|$|E

I {{want him to know}} this: the man who has <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> honour of bestowing this distinction upon him values and admires him more than ever." [...] De Gaulle and Churchill maintained a friendly relationship after World War II. Upon Churchill's death on 24 January 1965 de Gaulle wrote to Queen Elizabeth, [...] "In the great drama he was the greatest of all." ...|$|E
2500|$|Evangelical {{organisation}} Andrew Wommack Ministries declared {{support for}} the bill.

Uganda had <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> United Nations try to pressure them into passing pro-homosexual legislation in order to obtain a large sum of money offered to them (a bribe). They responded with this legislation in order to stop the strong arm tactics of the pro-homosexual western influence. Would to God American leaders had enough integrity to not be bribed or badgered into compliance. Although I knew the situation was being misrepresented, I didn't feel qualified to deal with this personally. But Leland Shores who runs our office in Kampala, Uganda is well aware of the details and has written a response worthy of everyone who has an interest in this reading. He has included a letter from over 200 Ugandan Christian leaders explaining the situation." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1984, he was {{appointed}} {{as a member of}} the Order of the Companions of Honour (CH) by Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom on the advice of the British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher for his [...] "services to the study of economics". Hayek had hoped to receive a baronetcy, and after he was awarded the CH he sent a letter to his friends requesting that he be called the English version of Friedrich (Frederick) from now on. After his twenty-minute audience with the Queen, he was [...] "absolutely besotted" [...] with her according to his daughter-in-law, Esca Hayek. Hayek said a year later that he was [...] "amazed by her. That ease and skill, as if she'd known me all my life." [...] The audience with the Queen was followed by a dinner with family and friends at the Institute of Economic Affairs.

He later participated in the final [...] "lance on lance" [...] action of the war on 7 September 1914 at Moncel when he led a charge of two troops of B Squadron of his Regiment and overthrew a squadron of the 1st Guard Dragoons. In this second charge, Campbell was wounded several times; the medical officer of the 4th Dragoon Guards, Captain Arthur Osburn, found him sprawled in a field of clover and treated him for [...] "a revolver wound in his leg, a lance wound in his shoulder, and a sword wound in his arm". Despite this, Campbell told the doctor [...] "I've <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> best quarter of an hour I've ever had in my life!" [...] In November 1914 Campbell was promoted to command 6th Cavalry Brigade, then in May 1916 came further promotion to command 21st Division. He retained that command for the rest of the war. His divisional staff gave him the further nickname of [...] "Barbara", the reason for which is no longer known.|$|E
