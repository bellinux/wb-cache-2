5|$|The slime glands {{along the}} body of the <b>hagfish</b> secrete {{enormous}} amounts of mucus when it is provoked or stressed. The gelatinous slime has dramatic effects on the flow and viscosity of water, rapidly clogging the gills of any fish that attempt to capture hagfish; predators typically release the <b>hagfish</b> within seconds (pictured above). Common predators of <b>hagfish</b> include seabirds, pinnipeds and cetaceans, but few fish, suggesting that predatory fish avoid <b>hagfish</b> as prey.|$|E
5|$|In the jawless fish (lampreys and <b>hagfish),</b> true lymphoid {{organs are}} absent. These fish rely on regions of lymphoid tissue within other organs to produce immune cells. For example, erythrocytes, macrophages and plasma cells are {{produced}} in the anterior kidney (or pronephros) and {{some areas of the}} gut (where granulocytes mature.) They resemble primitive bone marrow in <b>hagfish.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{position}} of <b>hagfish</b> in the phylum Chordata is not settled. Phylogenetic research in 1998 and 1999 supported {{the idea that}} the <b>hagfish</b> and the lampreys form a natural group, the Cyclostomata, that is a sister group of the Gnathostomata.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Anti-predator {{adaptation}} in action: {{the seal}} shark Dalatias licha (a-c) and the wreckfish Polyprion americanus (d-f) attempt to prey on <b>hagfishes.</b> First, the predators approach their potential prey. Predators bite {{or try to}} swallow the <b>hagfishes,</b> but the <b>hagfishes</b> have already projected jets of slime (arrows) into the predators' mouths. Choking, the predators release the <b>hagfishes</b> and gag {{in an attempt to}} remove slime from their mouths and gill chambers.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>hagfishes</b> and {{lampreys}} {{have just}} one gonad, but for different reasons. In <b>hagfishes</b> it is because only a single gonad is developed during their ontogeny, while it is achieved through the fusion of gonads in lampreys.|$|R
50|$|Unlike jawed vertebrates, {{which have}} three semicircular canals in each inner ear, {{lampreys}} {{have only two}} and <b>hagfishes</b> just one. But the semicircular canal of <b>hagfishes</b> contains both stereocilia and a second class of hair cells, apparently a derived trait, whereas lampreys and other vertebrates have stereocilia only. Because the inner ear of <b>hagfishes</b> has two forms of sensory ampullae, their single semicircular canal {{is assumed to be}} a result of two semicircular canals that have merged into just one.|$|R
5|$|The first {{vertebrates}} appeared over 500million {{years ago}} (Mya), during the Cambrian period, {{and may have}} resembled the modern <b>hagfish</b> in form. Sharks appeared about 450Mya, amphibians about 400Mya, reptiles about 350Mya, and mammals about 200Mya. Each species has an equally long evolutionary history, but the brains of modern hagfishes, lampreys, sharks, amphibians, reptiles, and mammals show a gradient of size and complexity that roughly follows the evolutionary sequence. All of these brains contain {{the same set of}} basic anatomical components, but many are rudimentary in the <b>hagfish,</b> whereas in mammals the foremost part (the telencephalon) is greatly elaborated and expanded.|$|E
5|$|The {{hindbrain}} (or metencephalon) {{is particularly}} involved in swimming and balance. The cerebellum is a single-lobed structure that is typically the biggest {{part of the}} brain. <b>Hagfish</b> and lampreys have relatively small cerebellae, while the mormyrid cerebellum is massive and apparently involved in their electrical sense.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{brains are}} divided into several regions. At the front are the {{olfactory}} lobes, a pair of structures that receive and process signals from the nostrils via the two olfactory nerves. The olfactory lobes are very large in fish that hunt primarily by smell, such as <b>hagfish,</b> sharks, and catfish. Behind the olfactory lobes is the two-lobed telencephalon, the structural equivalent to the cerebrum in higher vertebrates. In fish the telencephalon is concerned mostly with olfaction. Together these structures form the forebrain.|$|E
5000|$|However, the {{validity}} of the taxon [...] "Craniata" [...] was recently examined by Delarbre et al. (2002) using mtDNA sequence data, concluding the Myxini are more closely related to Hyperoartia than to Gnathostomata - i.e., that modern jawless fishes form a clade called Cyclostomata. The argument is that if the Cyclostomata are indeed monophyletic, Vertebrata would return to its old content (Gnathostomata + Cyclostomata) and the name Craniata, being superfluous, would become a junior synonym. The current classification supported by molecular analyses (which show that lampreys and <b>hagfishes</b> are sister taxa), as well as the fact that <b>hagfishes</b> do, in fact, have rudimentary vertebrae places <b>hagfishes</b> in Cyclostomata.|$|R
25|$|Rattails and {{brotulas}} are common, {{and other}} well-established families are eels, eelpouts, <b>hagfishes,</b> greeneyes, batfishes and lumpfishes.|$|R
50|$|The lamprey {{intestine}} has a typhlosole {{that increases}} the inner surface like the spiral valve does in some jawed vertebrates. The spiral valve in the latter develops by twisting the whole gut, while the lamprey typhlosole is confined to the mucous membrane of the intestines. The mucous membranes of <b>hagfishes</b> have a primitive typhlosole {{in the form of}} permanent zigzag ridges. This trait could be a primitive one, since it is also found in some sea squirts such as Ciona. The intestinal epiphelia of lampreys also have ciliated cells, which have not been detected in <b>hagfishes.</b> Because ciliated intestines are also found in Chondrostei, lungfishes and the early stages of some teleosts, it is considered a primitive condition that has been lost in <b>hagfishes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The diet of {{tilefish}} larvae is unknown, but it {{is believed}} to be zooplankton. Juvenile and adults are omnivorous with a preference for small benthic invertebrates, with a staple being crabs and lobster. Great northern tilefish also consume bivalve molluscs, salps, squid, Atlantic dogfish, mackrel, <b>hagfish,</b> and herring. Human trash is also eaten, including potato peels and meat bones. They also eat other tilefish in a display of cannibalistism.|$|E
5|$|The various fish groups {{account for}} more than half of {{vertebrate}} species. There are almost 28,000 known extant species, of which almost 27,000 are bony fish, with 970 sharks, rays, and chimeras and about 108 <b>hagfish</b> and lampreys. A third of these species fall within the nine largest families; from largest to smallest, these families are Cyprinidae, Gobiidae, Cichlidae, Characidae, Loricariidae, Balitoridae, Serranidae, Labridae, and Scorpaenidae. About 64 families are monotypic, containing only one species. The final total of extant species may grow to exceed 32,500.|$|E
5|$|Compared {{to other}} deep-sea sharks, the Izak {{catshark}} {{has a large}} heart suggestive of a relatively active lifestyle. It is a generalist that feeds {{on a wide variety}} of bony fishes, crustaceans, and cephalopods; larger sharks consume proportionately more crustaceans and fewer fishes. At least some part of its recorded diet probably represents scavenging from fishery discards, given the presence of fast-moving, pelagic species that the shark is unlikely to have captured live. Polychaete worms, hydrozoans, gastropods, and <b>hagfish</b> eggs may also be occasionally ingested. This species often has nematode and flatworm parasites in its stomach.|$|E

5000|$|Lampreys have {{vertebral}} arches, {{but nothing}} resembling the vertebral bodies {{found in all}} higher vertebrates. Even the arches are discontinuous, consisting of separate pieces of arch-shaped cartilage around the spinal cord {{in most parts of}} the body, changing to long strips of cartilage above and below in the tail region. <b>Hagfishes</b> lack a true vertebral column, and are therefore not properly considered vertebrates, but a few tiny neural arches are present in the tail. <b>Hagfishes</b> do, however, possess a cranium. For this reason, the vertebrate subphylum is sometimes referred to as [...] "Craniata" [...] when discussing morphology. Molecular analysis since 1992 has suggested that the <b>hagfishes</b> are most closely related to lampreys, and so also are vertebrates in a monophyletic sense. Others consider them a sister group of vertebrates in the common taxon of Craniata.|$|R
5|$|Deterioration of whale {{carcasses}} happens {{though a}} series of three stages. Initially, moving organisms such as sharks and <b>hagfish,</b> scavenge the soft tissues at a rapid rate over a period of months, and as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulfide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
5|$|Evolution of the {{adaptive}} immune system occurred in an ancestor of the jawed vertebrates. Many of the classical molecules of {{the adaptive}} immune system (e.g., immunoglobulins and T-cell receptors) exist only in jawed vertebrates. However, a distinct lymphocyte-derived molecule has been discovered in primitive jawless vertebrates, such as the lamprey and <b>hagfish.</b> These animals possess a large array of molecules called Variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) that, like the antigen receptors of jawed vertebrates, are produced from {{only a small number}} (one or two) of genes. These molecules are believed to bind pathogenic antigens in a similar way to antibodies, and with the same degree of specificity.|$|E
5|$|Vision is an {{important}} sensory system for most species of fish. Fish eyes {{are similar to those}} of terrestrial vertebrates like birds and mammals, but have a more spherical lens. Their retinas generally have both rods and cones (for scotopic and photopic vision), and most species have colour vision. Some fish can see ultraviolet and some can see polarized light. Amongst jawless fish, the lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the <b>hagfish</b> has only primitive eyespots. Fish vision shows adaptation to their visual environment, for example deep sea fishes have eyes suited to the dark environment.|$|E

5|$|Climatic and osmotic {{pressure}} places physiological constraints on organisms, {{especially those that}} fly and respire at high altitudes, or dive to deep ocean depths. These constraints influence vertical limits of ecosystems in the biosphere, as organisms are physiologically sensitive and adapted to atmospheric and osmotic water pressure differences. For example, oxygen levels decrease with decreasing pressure and are a limiting factor for life at higher altitudes. Water transportation by plants is another important ecophysiological process affected by {{osmotic pressure}} gradients. Water pressure {{in the depths of}} oceans requires that organisms adapt to these conditions. For example, diving animals such as whales, dolphins, and seals are specially adapted to deal with changes in sound due to water pressure differences. Differences between <b>hagfish</b> species provide another example of adaptation to deep-sea pressure through specialized protein adaptations.|$|E
5|$|There is {{considerable}} {{variation in the}} size and shape of the cerebellum in different vertebrate species. In amphibians, it is little developed, and in lampreys, and <b>hagfish,</b> the cerebellum is barely distinguishable from the brain-stem. Although the spinocerebellum is present in these groups, the primary structures are small, paired-nuclei corresponding to the vestibulocerebellum. The cerebellum is a bit larger in reptiles, considerably larger in birds, and larger yet in mammals. The large paired and convoluted lobes found in humans are typical of mammals, but the cerebellum is, in general, a single median lobe in other groups, and is either smooth or only slightly grooved. In mammals, the neocerebellum is the major part of the cerebellum by mass, but, in other vertebrates, it is typically the spinocerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Upon death, whale {{carcasses}} fall to {{the deep}} ocean and provide a substantial habitat for marine life. Evidence of whale falls in present-day and fossil records shows that deep sea whale falls support a rich assemblage of creatures, with a global diversity of 407 species, comparable to other neritic biodiversity hotspots, such as cold seeps and hydrothermal vents. Deterioration of whale carcasses happens though {{a series of three}} stages. Initially, moving organisms, such as sharks and <b>hagfish,</b> scavenge soft tissue at a rapid rate over a period of months to as long as two years. This is followed by the colonization of bones and surrounding sediments (which contain organic matter) by enrichment opportunists, such as crustaceans and polychaetes, throughout a period of years. Finally, sulfophilic bacteria reduce the bones releasing hydrogen sulphide enabling the growth of chemoautotrophic organisms, which in turn, support other organisms such as mussels, clams, limpets, and sea snails. This stage may last for decades and supports a rich assemblage of species, averaging 185 species per site.|$|E
50|$|There are {{exceptions}} in both cases, however. Similarities in the cartilage and {{muscles of the}} tongue apparatus also provide evidence of sister-group relationship between lampreys and <b>hagfishes.</b> And at least one molecular phylogeny has supported the vertebrate hypothesis. The embryonic development of <b>hagfishes</b> was once held to be drastically {{different from that of}} lampreys and gnathostomes, but recent evidence suggests that it is more similar than previously thought, which may remove an obstacle to the cyclostome hypothesis. There is at present no consensus on the correct topology.|$|R
5000|$|Pteraspidomorphs {{have been}} first {{regarded}} {{as related to}} bony fishes, then to sharks, then ancestral to <b>hagfishes,</b> and finally as the closest jawless relatives of the gnathostomes.|$|R
50|$|Some {{species of}} cartilagenous fish possess A-delta fibres, however, C fibres are either absent orfound in very low numbers. The Agnatha (<b>hagfishes</b> and lamprey) {{primarily}} have Group C fibres.|$|R
25|$|Extant jawless {{fish are}} either lamprey or <b>hagfish.</b> Juvenile lamprey feed by sucking up mud {{containing}} micro-organisms and organic debris. The lamprey has well-developed eyes, while the <b>hagfish</b> has only primitive eyespots. The <b>hagfish</b> coats itself and carcasses it finds with noxious slime to deter predators, and periodically ties {{itself into a}} knot to scrape the slime off. It is the only invertebrate fish and the only animal which has a skull but no vertebral column. It has four hearts, two brains, and a paddle-like tail.|$|E
25|$|The {{primitive}} lampreys and <b>hagfish,</b> however, have {{a simpler}} system. The inner ear in these species {{consists of a}} single vestibular chamber, although in lampreys, this {{is associated with a}} series of sacs lined by cilia. Lampreys have only two semicircular canals, with the horizontal canal being absent, while <b>hagfish</b> have only a single, vertical, canal.|$|E
25|$|Taxonomists place {{lampreys}} and <b>hagfish</b> in the subphylum Vertebrata of the phylum Chordata, {{which also}} includes the invertebrate subphyla Tunicata (sea-squirts) and the fish-like Cephalochordata (lancelets or Amphioxus). Recent molecular and morphological phylogenetic studies place lampreys and <b>hagfish</b> in the superclass Agnatha or Agnathostomata (both meaning without jaws). The other vertebrate superclass is Gnathostomata (jawed mouths) and includes the classes Chondrichthyes (sharks), Osteichthyes (bony fishes), Amphibia, Reptilia, Aves, and Mammalia.|$|E
40|$|Robert L. Wisner (1999) Description {{of two new}} subfamilies and a new genus of <b>hagfishes</b> (Cyclostomata: Myxinidae). Zoological Studies 38 (3) : 307 - 313.
