But we find, by experience, that burning their empty towns has not the desired effect. They can soon build others. They must be {{followed}} up and beaten, or the British, whom they draw their support from, totally driven out of their country. I believe if Detroit was demolished, it would be a good step toward giving some, at least, temporary ease to this country.|$|E

I've had some conversations with people saying 'it's {{getting a bit}} expensive Alan' and I know <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> think the obvious route is the Geoffrey Watling stand, whether you put another layer on it or take it down and re-build, I don't know. Probably the sensible {{thing to do is}} bite the bullet, take it down and build a new stand, but it means 18 to 24 months without revenue and the people in that stand tend to be {{the people who have been}} the supporters for many generations.|$|E

Nor did thy goodness fetch me again unto thee, after that I for thy transgressions have hid my face, and withdrawn my presence from thee. The way of backsliding was thine, but the way and means of thy recovery <b>was</b> mine. <b>I</b> invented the means of thy return; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that made an hedge and a wall, when thou wast beginning to turn to things in which <b>I</b> delighted not. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that made thy sweet bitter, thy day night, thy smooth way thorny, and that also confounded all that sought thy destruction. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that set Mr. Godly-Fear to work in Mansoul. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that stirred up thy conscience and understanding, thy will and thy affections, after thy great and woful decay. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that put life into thee, O Mansoul, to seek me, that thou mightest find me, and in thy finding find thine own health, happiness, and salvation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that fetched the second time the Diabolonians out of Mansoul; and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>I</b> that overcame them, and that destroyed them before thy face.|$|R

25|$|A {{primary source}} has {{reported}} a functional neuroimaging experiment, where participants were scanned while they imitated an experimenter performing constructions with small objects {{and while the}} experimenter, while performing such a manipulation, imitated the participants. Across both conditions, the participants' sense of ownership (the sense that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>I</b> who am experiencing the movement or thought) {{as well as the}} visual and somatosensory inputs were similar or coincided. What differed between imitating and being imitated was the agent who initiated the action. The primary source reports that several key regions were involved in the two conditions of reciprocal imitation compared to a control condition (in which subjects acted differently from the experimenter), namely in the superior temporal sulcus, the temporoparietal cortex (TPJ), and the medial prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And I certainly never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. <b>It</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E

500|$|In Frankfurt she met {{and married}} a white German man named Alexander.

When she and Alexander went to get their marriage license, the registrar greeted Alexander, wrote down his name, and then asked [...] "Where is the bride?" [...] As they were descending the courthouse steps after their wedding, a passerby offered wedding congratulations to the maid of honor.

500|$|This {{episode was}} {{generally}} well received by critics. Abby West of Entertainment Weekly stated that [...] "one {{of the many}} things I love about the show is how current <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> <b>I</b> love the pop-culture references, like Losts Dharma Initiative, Deal or No Deal, and that soon-to-be classic SNL/Chronicles of Narnia sketch. IGN's Brian Zoromski said that although the episode had [...] "a few hit and miss moments", it [...] "was a very well done episode that carried through on three main storylines" [...] and [...] "began and ended beautifully". Aaron from eTV Review said that even if it [...] "wasn’t as good as last week’s episode", it was still [...] "another great one". In a poll done by OfficeTally.com, [...] "Initiation" [...] was ranked by viewers as the thirteenth funniest of the twenty-three episodes of the third season.|$|E
500|$|Euan Ferguson, {{writing in}} The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, stated that [...] "It's good. Which {{is to say}} it's better than it could have been. It is not, however, that good." [...] He noted that Faulks [...] "evokes scenes with deft skill: recreates a time and a world with great brio, and manages it with the block script of Fleming's journalistic nature rather than his own more cursive style." [...] Ferguson {{remained}} unsatisfied by the book, although he absolves {{the author of the}} blame, saying [...] "the problem isn't Faulks, it's Bond. With Fleming's untimely death, the link was broken". Ferguson is pessimistic about Bond's future and predicted that [...] "Bond's tux now flaps in the wind and despite Faulks having made such a well-finessed fist of this, <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> suspect, a last hurrah for 007, destined to die on the page, if not the screen".|$|E
500|$|In {{reporting}} on Ballo's death, United Press International noted, [...] "Critics say the break-you-down-build-you-up recruitment tool of Scientologists is controversial." [...] The issue received {{a significant amount}} of coverage in Norway news publications; and media attention focused criticism on the Church of Scientology. Both Verdens Gang and Dagbladet devoted several cover stories investigating the matter. News media received criticism regarding the amount of coverage given to the incident. A representative of the National Association for Suicide Survivors in Norway regarded it as excessive. News editor of Dagbladet, Peter Raaum, defended the amount of news coverage given to the incident: [...] "We write about this because the survivor has made criticism of the Scientology test that Kaja took just before she took her life. The family wanted a debate about this. What makes this so important is this test. What kind of test is this? Is it so reprehensible, and significant to what happened? If <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> mean it's something that's extremely important to focus on." [...] Ballo's family agreed to discuss the incident with the media. In an interview Ballo's father said he did not have issues with the case being front-page news in newspapers.|$|E
