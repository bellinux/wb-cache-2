40|$|<b>Inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> at {{one and two}} loci are {{evaluated}} for recurrent selection and overlapping generations selection schemes. These mating schemes have found great use in plant and animal breeding. The <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> are derived in terms of probability measures that genes are identical by descent. The procedures demonstrated here {{can be applied to}} any regular system of mating between individuals or groups of individuals. For individual mating systems, two digametic individual measures are defined and employed in the derivation of a recurrence formula for the one-locus <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Two further classes of individual measures, trigametic and quadrigametic, are required for transition {{from one generation to the}} previous one to allow the calculation of the <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> for the two-locus case. This process is illustrated for the case of recurrent selection. For recurrent selection populations with various imposed assumptions, numerical values of the average <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> at the end of the breeding cycles are listed to demonstrate the effects of linkage and population size on the accrual of inbreeding and hence of homozygosity. For group mating systems, gametic set measures are needed in addition to the average individual measures. Transition equations relating values in successive generations of gametic set measures are established for the calculation of the group <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients.</b> As an illustration of this process, the one- and two-locus <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> for populations with overlapping generations {{are evaluated}}.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews and}} {{discusses}} {{what is known}} about the relationship between identity in state, allele frequency, <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients,</b> and identity by descent in various uses of these terms. Generic definitions of <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> are given, as ratios of differences of probabilities of identity in state. Then some of their properties are derived from an assumption in terms of differences between distributions of coalescence times of different genes. These <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> give an approximate measurement of how much higher the probability of recent coalescence is for some pair of genes relative to another pair. Such a measure is in general not equivalent to identity by descent; rather, it approximates a ratio of differences of probabilities of identity by descent. These results are contrasted with some other formulas relating identity, allele frequency, and <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients.</b> Additional assumptions are necessary to obtain most of them, and some of these assumptions are not always correct, for example when there is localized dispersal. Therefore, definitions based on such formulas are not always well-formulated. By contrast, the generic definitions are both well-formulated and more broadly applicable...|$|R

40|$|A new {{deterministic}} method for predicting simultaneous <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> at {{three and four}} loci is presented. The method involves calculating the conditional probability of IBD (identical by descent) at one locus given IBD at other loci, and multiplying this probability by the prior probability of the latter loci being simultaneously IBD. The conditional probability is obtained applying a novel regression model, and the prior probability from the theory of digenic measures of Weir and Cockerham. The model was validated for a finite monoecious population mating at random, with a constant effective population size, and with or without selfing, and also for an infinite population with a constant intermediate proportion of selfing. We assumed discrete generations. Deterministic predictions were very accurate when compared with simulation results, and robust to alternative forms of implementation. These simultaneous <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> were more sensitive to changes in effective population size than in marker spacing.

40|$|It {{is crucial}} to {{understand}} the genetic health and implications of inbreeding in wildlife populations, especially of vulnerable species. Using extensive demographic and genetic data, we investigated the relationships among pedigree <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients,</b> metrics of molecular heterozygosity and fitness for a large population of endangered African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in South Africa. Molecular metrics based on 19 microsatellite loci were significantly, but modestly correlated to <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> in this population. Inbred wild dogs with <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> of C 0. 25 and subordinate individuals had shorter lifespans than outbred and dominant contemporaries, suggesting some deleterious effects of inbreeding. However, this trend was confounded by packspecific effects as many inbred individuals originated from a single large pack. Despite wild dogs being endangered and existing in small populations, findings within our sample population indicated that molecular metrics were not robust predictors in models of fitness based on breeding pack formation, dominance, reproductive success or lifespan of individuals. Nonetheless, our approach has generated a vital database for future comparative studies to examine these relationships over longer periods of time. Such detailed assessments are essential given knowledge that wild canids can be highly vulnerable to inbreeding effects over a few short generations...|$|R
40|$|The {{nonlinear}} {{effects of}} inbreeding were studied by comparing linear and curvilinear regression models of phenotypic performances on <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> for production traits (milk, fat, and protein yields) of Holstein cows {{in their first}} lactation. Three different regression models (linear, quadratic, and cubic) were introduced separately into a single-trait, single-lactation, random regression test-day model. The significance of the different regression coefficients was studied based on a t-test after estimation of error variances and covariances associated with the different regression coefficients. All of the tested regression coefficients were significantly different from 0.

40|$|Fluctuating {{asymmetry}} (FA), {{a measure}} of developmental stability, has been proposed as a simple technique for identifying populations suffering from inbreeding {{and a loss of}} genetic diversity. However, there is controversy regarding the relationship between FA and both allozyme heterozygosity and pedigree <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> (F). FA of sternopleural bristle number in Drosophila melanogaster was measured in populations maintained at effective sizes of 25 (8 replicates), 50 (6), 100 (4), 250 (3) and 500 (2) for 50 generations (<b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 05 — 0. 71). FA was calculated from the same data set using three different indices (FA₁, FA₅ and FA₆). There was no significant relationship of FA with pedigree <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> for any of the three indices. The relationship between FA and allozyme heterozygosity was non-significant for indices FA₅ and FA₆ (the more powerful indices) and only significant for FA₁ 1. A second comparison of highly inbred (F ~ 1) populations with their outbred base population showed significantly greater FA in the inbred populations only when analysed with FA₆. Analysis of the same data using FA₁ and FA₅ showed non-significant relationships in the opposite direction. If a relationship between FA and genetic diversity does exist, it is weak and inconsistent. Consequently, our results do not support the use of FA as a monitoring tool to detect inbreeding or loss of genetic diversity. 8 page(s...|$|R

A method {{adapted to the}} dairy cattle situation is presented to approximate inbreeding when the stored population pedigree is incomplete.

These groups were linked to contemporary reference groups with known parents. An explicit model considered that polygenic breeding values in a censored group were centred on {{a function of the}} average breeding value in the corresponding reference group and deviated independently. <b>Inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> were obtained progressively over birth dates starting from founders.

Data were 50, 000 simulated markers and 39, 985 actual markers for 2391 genotyped Holstein bulls. Gene content of relatives and gene frequencies {{in the base}} (founder) population were estimated using pedigrees and a linear model. Ancestors born since 1950 were included, {{for a total of}} 22, 088 animals. Because pedigrees were very complete, only one unknown-parent group was used. Convergence to 5 digits of accuracy required about 1000 iterations. Total time was 2 processor days and proportional to number of animals times markers, but actual clock time was reduced by processing loci on separate chromosomes in parallel. Simple allele frequencies were obtained from only the known genotypes. True base frequencies were correlated with estimated base frequencies by 0. 98 versus 0. 94 with simple frequencies. Genomic predictions and <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> were computed in four ways, using true or estimated base frequencies, simple frequencies, or an “estimate” of. 5 for each marker. When allele frequencies estimates were used instead of 0. 5 to assign mixed model coefficients, solutions converged more slowly but predictions were more accurate. From simulated data, realized reliabilities for young bulls were 62. 8 % using either true or estimated base frequencies, 62. 6 % using simple frequencies, and 62. 0 % using frequencies set to 0. 5. Pedigree and genomic <b>inbreeding</b> <b>coefficients</b> were correlated by 0. 73 using true base frequencies, 0. 67 using estimated base frequencies, 0. 12 using simple frequencies, and 0. 72 when frequencies were set to 0. 5.
