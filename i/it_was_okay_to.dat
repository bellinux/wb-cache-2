The WHA All-Stars were coached by Jacques Demers, and Demers asked Howe if <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> <b>to</b> put him on a line with Gretzky and his son Mark.

Vaughan wrote, [...] "In its lewd, spontaneous, hysterical and glamorous way, Vazaleen defined a new Toronto aesthetic, a playful and {{endlessly}} inventive mode of presentation that encompassed everything from lesbian prog- rock to tranny camp to vintage punk revival to good old-fashioned loud-mouthed drag." [...] In {{an editorial in}} C magazine, Amish Morrell wrote, [...] "At [...] {{it was not only}} okay to be gay, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> <b>to</b> be other than gay. One could be just about anything. The effect was that it completely destabilized all preconceptions of gender and sexual identity, in a hyperlibidinous environment where everyone became a performer." [...] Benjamin Boles of Now wrote, [...] "These days it’s normal in Toronto for hip gay scenes to flourish outside of the queer ghetto and to attract a wide spectrum of genders and orientations, but that didn’t really happen until Vazaleen took off and became a veritable community for everyone who didn’t fit into the mainstream homo world. For too long, it was too rare to see dykes, fags, trans people, and breeders hanging out together, and Munro changed that." [...] Vazaleen became a launching pad for such musical acts as Peaches and Lesbians on Ecstasy. Other bands performing at Vazaleen early in their careers were The Hidden Cameras, Crystal Castles, and The Gossip. At the height of the event's popularity, Munro appeared on the cover of Now magazine (made up to look similar to David Bowie's Aladdin Sane album cover), musical guests included Carole Pope, Tracy + the Plastics, Vaginal Davis, Glen Meadmore and Nina Hagen, and Vazaleen appeared on [...] "best-of" [...] nightclub lists internationally.|$|E

[...] The character has also received positive attention from feminist critics; in her article [...] "12 Life Lessons 'Kim Possible' Taught Us That Are Still Pretty Relevant", Kadeen Griffiths of Bustle described Kim as an [...] "amazingly feminist" [...] character [...] "that taught girls that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> <b>to</b> overachieve, that worrying about boys didn't make you any less of a hero, and that you could invent your own slang and still sound (sort of) cool."

And so can all of us." [...] BuzzFeed ranked Kim ninth on its list of [...] "17 Characters From Your Childhood That Were More Feminist Than You Remember", with author Ellie Bate crediting the character with [...] "break the sexist stereotype that all cheerleaders are nothing but bimbos". Bustle writer Sarah Freymiller agreed that [...] "Kim offers a model for femininity that both bolsters and works against the typical 'high school cheerleader' stereotype." [...] Pride ranked Kim 11th on its list of [...] "13 Cartoon Characters Who Defied Gender Stereotypes". In her article [...] "Power feminism, mediated: Girl power and the commercial politics of change", Rebecca C. Hains of Salem State College cited Kim among several [...] "strong powerful girl [...] heroes" [...] who are responsible for [...] "breaking the mold by placing girls at the center of narratives with active agency and unfettered power" [...] during the early 2000s. MTV compared the character to American spy Virginia Hall in their article [...] "9 Cartoon Feminists Who Remind Us of Real-life Badass Women". While ranking Kim Possible: So the Drama the 12th most feminist Disney Channel Original Movie, Priya Krishna of BuzzFeed described Kim as [...] "obviously great". Comparing Kim to comic book superheroine Wonder Woman, Kathryn Shattuck of The New York Times wrote, [...] "MOVE over, boy wonders. The newest superhero on the block doesn't need a gimmicky mask or a jolt of testosterone to get the job done ... Kim Possible is ready and able to rescue humankind from evildoers without sacrificing her interest in boys and clothes." [...] However, in her book Girlfighting: Betrayal and Rejection, author Lyn Mikel Brown dismissed Kim as both a feminist and role model because of her alleged reliance on Ron's intelligence, as well as the observation that [...] "Her biggest threat is not evil, in fact, but the head cheerleader". Since her debut, Kim has proven herself a popular character among both girls and boys, although McCorkle admitted that [...] "whenever you have a girl in the lead doing all the action stuff, there’s a certain age group of boys who won’t admit they like the stuff. They really want to see the boy in that role." [...] McCorkle recalled an incident in which a fan of the show was very much surprised to learn that the writers were actually men upon meeting them; the fan had always just assumed that they were both young women because of the way in which they characterized Kim. At one point, fans of the character had sent her over one million e-mails via her interactive website.|$|E

And I’m not an advocate for that. However, I {{think that we need}} to prioritize our law enforcement efforts. And if somebody’s gonna smoke a joint in their house and not do anybody else any harm, then perhaps there are other things that our cops should be looking at to engage in and try to clean up some of the other problems that we have in society that are appropriate for law enforcement to do and not concentrate on such a, relatively speaking, minimal problem that we have in the country." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{increased}} media exposure {{was difficult}} for Fox, who acknowledged being shy and insecure, to adjust to. It also positioned her as a potential role model, and later led to her being typecast. She stated that people sometimes avoided her to remain out of the media's spotlight, {{and that she was}} a different role model for girls that maybe America was not comfortable with. She rejected the notion of preaching to kids about appropriate behaviors, or about what women should be, but said that she could make young girls feel [...] "strong and intelligent and be outspoken and fight for what they think is right." [...] Fox viewed her constant references to sex as feminist commentary and not simply headline-seeking, and wanted women and young girls to believe that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> <b>to</b> feel sexy and find power in that. She did not view being typecast as attractive as bad and felt that it can enable her to surprise people when she gives a good performance in a film, and inspire her to be an overachiever, but said she is interested in portraying less sexualized characters. MTV's Craig Flaster said that although Fox has [...] "been typecast as the big-budget sex symbol", she has shown comedic range.|$|E

When the Carolina-Kansas result news got through, Mike Krzyzewski asked the team if they felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>okay</b> <b>to</b> lose since that meant they would do no worse than the Tar Heels, and some nodded. Krzyzewski understood but then added, [...] "Flush it. Let's go kick their ass." [...] Duke then stunned the sports world by defeating UNLV 79–77 and then went one better by beating Kansas 72–65 in the championship game to win its first national title. Chansky writes that one UNC athletic department staffer in Indianapolis was so distraught that he did not leave his hotel room the day after the national championship game, while when Duke arrived back in Durham, Krzyzewski is said to have asked the team at a turnoff to Chapel Hill if the team wanted to cruise down Franklin Street. In the wake of the Final Four, when talking about how close the two rivals came to meeting for the national championship, Krzyzewski said that he never wanted to see it happen because regardless of who won, the pain of losing that game would be unbearable for the defeated school and its fans.|$|E
