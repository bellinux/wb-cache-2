2500|$|What's {{known as}} the skins game is a {{variation}} on the match play where each hole has an amount of money (called [...] "skin") attached to it. The lump sum may be prize money at the professional level (the most famous event to use these rules was the [...] "LG Skins Game", played at Indian Wells Golf Resort in California until 2008), or an amount wagered <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>hole</b> among amateur players. The player with the lowest score on the hole wins the skin for that hole; if two or more players tie for the lowest score, the skin carries over to the next hole. The game continues until a player wins a hole outright, which may (and evidently often does) result in a player receiving money for a previous hole that they had not tied for.|$|E
2500|$|Metal stoves {{came into}} {{use in the}} 18th century. An early and famous example of a metal stove is the Franklin stove, {{said to have been}} invented by Benjamin Franklin in 1742. It had a labyrinthine path for hot exhaust gases to escape, thus {{allowing}} heat to enter the room instead of going up the chimney. The Franklin stove, however, was designed for heating, not for cooking. Benjamin Thompson at the turn to the 19th century {{was among the first to}} present a working metal kitchen stove. His Rumford fireplace used one fire to heat several pots that were also hung into holes so that they could be heated from the sides, too. It was even possible to regulate the heat individually <b>for</b> <b>each</b> <b>hole.</b> His stove was designed for large canteen or castle kitchens, though. It would take another 30 years until the technology had been refined and the size of the iron stove been reduced enough for domestic use. Philo Stewart's Oberlin stove was a much more compact, wood-burning cast-iron [...] stove, patented in the U.S. in 1834. It became a huge commercial success with some 90,000 units sold in the next 30 years. In Europe, similar designs also appeared in the 1830s. In the following years, these iron stoves evolved into specialised cooking appliances with flue pipes connected to the chimney, oven holes, and installations for heating water. The originally open holes into which the pots were hung were now covered with concentric iron rings on which the pots were placed. Depending on the size of the pot or the heat needed, one could remove the inner rings.|$|E

Those described in Mann's paper Hydraulophone design considerations use water jets striking perforated spinning disks, shafts, or valves, to create a pulsating water flow, similar to a siren disk. A single disk, shaft, or valve assembly can have rings or passages with different numbers of holes for different notes.
