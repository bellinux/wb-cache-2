40|$|The {{construct}} of teacher efficacy has been explored {{by a number}} of researchers in recent years. Teachers’ efficacy beliefs are regarded as an important criterion in increasing the productivity and motivation during the teaching and the learning process and in defining the <b>general</b> <b>framework</b> of the <b>requirements</b> of the teaching profession. Consequently, teacher education programs have great responsibility for shaping the self-efficacy beliefs of pre-service teachers. The {{purpose of this study was}} to explore pre-service English teachers’ self-efficacy beliefs. Another purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of some variables (gender, perceived academic achievement, grade level, department preference and the attitude of the faculty as perceived by the pre-service teachers) upon self-efficacy of pre-service English teachers. Data in this study were collected from a total number of 353 pre-service English teachers (263 girls, 90 boys) enrolled in teacher education programs of the two selected universities in Turkey. Teacher self-efficacy scale (Kan, 2007) and information sheet which was developed by the researcher were utilized in the study. Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal Wallis H tests were used to data regarding the sample. Data analysis indicated that pre-service English teachers generally expressed positive efficacy beliefs regarding English language teaching profession. At the same time, results showed that pre-service teachers’ self-efficacy differentiated according to perceived academic achievement and grade level...|$|R

The principal motivation for such a re-examination arises from the current and anticipated evolution of CPUs, where multiple cores, hyper-threading and wide vector registers require a shift to a concurrent programming model. Such a model requires extensive changes in the current Gaudi/Athena frameworks and offers the opportunity to consider how HLT and offline processing can be better accommodated within the ATLAS framework.

40|$|Different {{simulation}} applications require {{different levels}} of model detail. As the complexities and flexibilities of manufacturing systems are ever increasing, the flexibility of simulation system to model real world systems with arbitrary levels of detail becomes important. Existing simulation systems provide predefined models that limit their flexibility. In this thesis, the author develops a conceptual modeling strategy that combines the Event-Scheduling strategy and the Object-Oriented paradigm. A basic element is developed to model any resource and is mapped to an extended Parallel DEVS formalism. This strategy provides <b>general</b> <b>framework</b> and system <b>requirements</b> for further computerized development. Such a system is able to implement recursive hierarchical modeling, which provides the environment to model real world systems at any level of detail. The basic element also provides simplified functions and syntaxes that make the system easy to learn and maintain. A two-layer object construction framework is also discussed to pushing down 2 ̆ 2 low-level 2 ̆ 2 aspects of simulation to the systems level, {{and away from the}} user. Several examples are developed in this thesis, which illustrate DOBIS has the potential to outperform existing systems in several aspects. Dept. of Industrial and Manufacturing Systems Engineering.

40|$|Abstract. There {{are many}} {{detectors}} for simple Least Significant Bit (LSB) steganography in digital images, {{the most sensitive}} of which make use of structural or combinatorial properties of the LSB embedding method. We give a <b>general</b> <b>framework</b> for detection and length estimation of these hidden messages, which potentially makes use of all the combinatorial structure. The framework subsumes some previously known structural detectors and suggests novel, more powerful detection algorithms. After presenting the <b>general</b> <b>framework</b> we give a detailed study of one particular novel detector, with experimental evidence {{that it is more}} powerful than those previously known, in most cases substantially so. However there are some outstanding issues to be solved for the wider application of the <b>general</b> <b>framework.</b> ...|$|R
