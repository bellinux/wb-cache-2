25|$|Cyclopropenylidene, or c-C3H2, is an {{aromatic}} molecule {{belonging to}} a highly reactive class of organic molecules known as carbenes. Due to its reactivity, cyclopropenylidene is only seen terrestrially in the laboratory. However, it is found in significant concentrations in the interstellar medium (ISM) due to the <b>extreme</b> <b>environment.</b> The linear isomer of c-C3H2 {{is also found in}} the ISM, but its column density is generally about an order of magnitude lower.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} {{materials}} at extreme conditions, high pressure and high temperature uses {{a wide array}} of techniques to achieve these conditions and probe the behavior of material while in the <b>extreme</b> <b>environment.</b> Percy Williams Bridgman, the great pioneer of high-pressure research {{during the first half of}} the 20th century, revolutionized the field of high pressures with his development of an opposed anvil device with small flat areas that were pressed one against the other with a lever-arm. The anvils were made of tungsten carbide (WC). This device could achieve pressure of a few gigapascals, and was used in electrical resistance and compressibility measurements. The principles of the DAC are similar to the Bridgman anvils but in order to achieve the highest possible pressures without breaking the anvils, they were made of the hardest known material: a single crystal diamond. The first prototypes were limited in their pressure range and there was not a reliable way to calibrate the pressure.|$|E

In addition {{to a number of}} broadcast towers, the mountain is the site of a non-profit scientific observatory reporting the weather as well as other aspects of the subarctic climate of the mountain. The <b>extreme</b> <b>environment</b> creates strong winds and ice at the top of Mount Washington making the use of unmanned equipment problematic. The observatory also conducts research, primarily the testing of new weather measurement devices. The Sherman Adams summit building, which houses the observatory, is closed to the public during the winter and hikers are not allowed inside the building except for emergencies and pre-arranged guided tours.|$|E
500|$|Extremophiles are {{microorganisms}} {{that have}} adapted {{so that they}} can survive and even thrive in extreme environments that are normally fatal to most life-forms. Thermophiles and hyperthermophiles thrive in high temperatures. Psychrophiles thrive in extremely low temperatures. – Temperatures as high as , as low as [...] Halophiles thrive in high salt conditions, up to saturation. Alkaliphiles thrive in an alkaline pH of about 8.5–11. Acidophiles can thrive in a pH of 2.0 or less. Piezophiles thrive at very high pressures: up to 1,000-2,000 atm, down to 0 atm as in a vacuum of space. A few extremophiles such as Deinococcus radiodurans are radioresistant, resisting radiation exposure of up to 5k Gy. Extremophiles are significant in different ways. They extend terrestrial life into much of the Earth's hydrosphere, crust and atmosphere, their specific evolutionary adaptation mechanisms to their <b>extreme</b> <b>environment</b> can be exploited in biotechnology, and their very existence under such extreme conditions increases the potential for extraterrestrial life.|$|E

500|$|The Eagle {{had been}} stocked with safety {{equipment}} such as guns, snowshoes, sleds, skis, a tent, a small boat (in {{the form of a}} bundle of bent sticks, to be assembled and covered with balloon silk), most of it stored not in the basket but in the storage space arranged above the balloon ring. These items had not been put together with great care, or with any acknowledgement of adopting indigenous peoples' techniques for dealing with the <b>extreme</b> <b>environment.</b> In this, Andrée contrasted not only with later but also with many earlier explorers. Sven Lundström points to the agonizing extra efforts that became necessary for the team due to Andrée's mistaken design of the sleds, with a rigid construction that borrowed nothing from the long proven Inuit sleds, and were so impractical for the difficult terrain. Andrée called it [...] "dreadful terrain", with channels separating the ice floes, high ridges, and partially iced-over melt ponds. The men's clothes included no furs but were woollen coats and trousers, plus oilskins. They wore the oilskins but the explorers reported always seeming to be damp or wet from the half-frozen pools of water on the ice and the typically foggy, humid Arctic summer air, and preoccupied with drying their clothes, mainly by wearing them. Danger was everywhere, as it would have meant certain death to lose the provisions lashed to one of the inconvenient sleds into one of the many channels that had to be laboriously crossed.|$|E

40|$|This review {{summarizes}} the current understanding on plant and algal {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) production and emission in <b>extreme</b> <b>environments,</b> where temperature, water availability, salinity or other environmental factors pose stress on vegetation. Here, the <b>extreme</b> <b>environments</b> include terrestrial systems, such as arctic tundra, deserts, CO 2 springs and wetlands, and marine systems such as sea ice, tidal rock pools and hypersaline environments, with mangroves and salt marshes at the land-sea interface. The emission potentials at fixed temperature and light level or actual emission rates for phototrophs in <b>extreme</b> <b>environments</b> are frequently higher than for organisms from less stressful environments. For example, plants from the arctic tundra appear to have higher emission potentials for isoprenoids than temperate species, and hypersaline marine habitats contribute to global dimethyl sulphide (DMS) emissions in significant amounts. DMS emissions are more widespread than previously considered, for example, in salt marshes and some desert plants. The reason for widespread VOC, especially isoprenoid, emissions from different <b>extreme</b> <b>environments</b> deserves further attention, as these compounds may have important roles in stress resistance and adaptation to extremes. Climate warming is likely to significantly increase VOC emissions from <b>extreme</b> <b>environments</b> both by direct effects on VOC production and volatility, and indirectly by altering {{the composition of the}} vegetation. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Life, {{as we know}} it, is {{constrained}} by various environmental parameters (physical and chemical) and these vary both in space and time. Combinations of specific ranges {{for each of these}} parameters within a particular area define biotopes or environmental conditions. Environments where {{one or more of the}} these parameters show values permanently close to the lower or upper limits known for life are considered <b>extreme</b> <b>environments.</b> In 2003, the European Science Foundation (ESF) initiated a new research support activity " Investigating Life in Extreme Environments" (ILEE). The key event of this initiative was an interdisciplinary workshop held in November 2005 and attended by 128 European scientists. The headline conclusions of this initiative expressed the need for a more coordinated approach to improved future opportunities for funding research on life in <b>extreme</b> <b>environments.</b> It was emphasised that such an approach should be interdisciplinary. The CAREX project (Coordination Action for Research Activities on life in <b>Extreme</b> <b>Environments)</b> is an FP 7 Coordination Action funded for three years (2008 - 2010) in the field of life in <b>extreme</b> <b>environments.</b> This interdisciplinary project will i) set up an interactive information platform, ii) develop open databases gathering information on life in <b>extreme</b> <b>environments</b> experts, research projects and specific infrastructures and technologies, iii) identify research priorities in order to define a European roadmap for research on life in <b>extreme</b> <b>environments,</b> and iv) promote the exchange of knowledge through the organisation of field trips, a laboratory seminar, a summer school and the award of short visit grants...|$|R
