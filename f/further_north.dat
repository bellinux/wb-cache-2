5|$|While Allen {{participated in}} some of the actions to drive {{surveyors}} away, he also spent much time exploring the entire territory, probably ranging as far north as the site of Burlington in his wanderings. After selling off some of his Connecticut properties, he began buying wild lands <b>further</b> <b>north</b> in the territory, which he sold at a profit as the southern settlements grew and people began to move <b>further</b> <b>north.</b>|$|E

5|$|Later that day, {{the ship}} {{captured}} a barge {{out from under}} the guns of Fort Powell, a fortification guarding another entrance to Mobile Bay <b>further</b> <b>north.</b> Chickasaw fired 25 shots at the fort and was struck once, another hit on her smokestack. On 6 August, the ship bombarded Fort Gaines for two hours in support of troops besieging the fort. Beginning on 13 August, she intermittently bombarded Fort Morgan until the fort surrendered on 23 August. Between 15–17 August, Chickasaw was operating <b>further</b> <b>north</b> in Mobile Bay and engaged several of the ships defending Mobile without result.|$|E

5|$|A brick privy with a {{gabled roof}} clad in {{corrugated}} asbestos sheeting is located {{to the north}} of the cottage building.

It features a flat and skillion roof, and concrete mounting blocks. Its most recent use was as a fishermen's cabin.|$|E
5|$|A broad {{outline of}} the Norte Chico diet has been suggested. At Caral, the edible domesticated plants noted by Shady are squash, beans, lúcuma, guava, pacay (Inga feuillei), and sweet potato.

5|$|A last {{option was}} to attack fighter factories, {{which was not}} {{attempted}} on 18 August. Only the Spitfire factory at Southampton and the Hawker factory in Surrey were within range of escorted bombers. Without the Bf 109s, the bombers would suffer heavy casualties attempting to attack factories <b>further</b> <b>north</b> in daylight. Still, {{the attacks on the}} southern factories would require large concentrations of bombers and fighters which would be powerful enough to destroy them without sustaining heavy losses.|$|E
5|$|After Plunder the II Canadian Corps, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Guy Simonds, struck west and seized Emmerich, approaching the IJssel from the east. Crerar {{saw an opportunity}} to take Arnhem and open a route between the city and Zutphen to the north, and ordered his two Corps commanders to coordinate their advances accordingly. However, he was wary of trying to seize Arnhem before the IJssel had been bridged <b>further</b> <b>north.</b>|$|E
5|$|As a {{tropical}} storm, Iris produced heavy rainfall {{across much of}} the Leeward Islands. In the southern Lesser Antilles, high waves caused coastal flooding in Trinidad, while in Martinique <b>further</b> <b>north,</b> significant amounts of precipitation led to flooding and landslides. The threat from the hurricane halted airplane evacuations on Montserrat, which was being threatened by the eruption of the Soufrière Hills volcano. There were five deaths in association with Irisfour in Martinique, and one in Guadeloupe.|$|E

He then started to play for local teams, including Adwick Juniors, Bullcroft Main Colliery and Denaby United and had an unsuccessful trial at Huddersfield Town.|$|E
5|$|Despite passing {{closest to}} the Florida Keys, impact was minimal, limited to {{tropical}} storm-force winds and light rainfall. The outerbands of Isaac produced heavy precipitation <b>further</b> <b>north,</b> especially in Palm Beach, St. Lucie and Indian River counties. In the former, the resultant flooding left numerous residents in Royal Palm Beach and Loxahatchee isolated. There was extensive street flooding, and water entered a few houses. Damage in Palm Beach County alone was nearly $71.6million (2012USD). Inland flooding was also reported in several other counties, though losses were generally minor. A tornado in Indian River County damaged 118mobile homes and 15single family homes. <b>Further</b> <b>north</b> in Central Florida and the Panhandle, the storm spawned four other tornadoes. Tides along the Gulf Coast of Florida caused erosion and coastal flooding in Bay, Collier, Franklin, Gulf, and Wakulla counties. Though winds caused little damage, around 113,000customers were left without electricity in South Florida. The storm resulted in two indirect fatalities, both caused by vehicles driving on slick roads in Palm Beach and Okeechobee counties. Throughout the state, damage reached approximately $91.45million.|$|E

5|$|Fieldfares often nest {{in small}} colonies, {{possibly}} {{for protection from}} predators. The nest is built in a tree where five or six eggs are laid. The chicks are fed by both parents and leave the nest after a fortnight.
