40|$|The idea of 'family practices' is now quite {{widely used}} in British family sociology. The aim {{of this article is}} to locate this {{reformulation}} by looking, firstly, at the term's place within more general discussions of practices and, secondly, to explore the implications of a more specific focus on <b>family</b> <b>practices.</b> Through a comparison with some other possible and overlapping approaches, I consider the extent and ways in which the <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> approach successfully goes 'beyond' more established understandings of <b>family.</b> <b>Family</b> <b>Practices,</b> <b>Family</b> Theory, Intimacy, Personal Life, Configurations...|$|R

40|$|Studying {{families}} {{has been}} of interest to scholars in many disciplines. The focus of these scholarly pursuits has most often been on “the family” rather than the process of “doing family,” or <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> (DeVault, 2000; Morgan, 2011). <b>Family</b> <b>practices</b> involve action, have temporal and spatial dimensions, and are shaped by larger social structures and discourses. Studying <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> has global societal implications. Understanding what families do, the taken-for-granted ways things are done, are considered {{in the development of}} policies, such as school readiness and family leave. However, within occupational science, the study of <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> has been surprisingly limited in scope and method. To broaden the conversation on <b>family</b> <b>practices,</b> this institute will address issues in the interdisciplinary field of family studies, from how families are conceptualized to how activity and practices are addressed. Next, how family occupation has been addressed in occupational science will be reviewed. The focus of the institute, however, will be on methods that illuminate family occupation as transactional, methods that take into account <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> within local and broader social landscapes and public discourses. The value of utilizing multiple methods, such as participant observation, visual methods, and discourse analysis, to uncover hidden processes that may otherwise be missed (Fontana 2 ̆ 6 Frey, 2003) will be emphasized. Challenges to conducting research on occupation with diverse families will be discussed, including conducting research in private and public spaces, the family as a unit of analysis, and obtaining and making sense of multiple perspectives.

40|$|This article {{presents}} data arising from {{a project that}} explored 22 children and young people’s experiences of having a parent with dementia. A key theme from the interviews highlighted the implications dementia has {{for the relationship between}} children and their parents – specifically, how individuals ‘do’ and display family when their parent’s personality and capacity to function as previously has been undermined. The data illustrate how these young people experience disruptions to existing <b>family</b> <b>practices,</b> and how they perpetuate a relationship with their parent in the face of dementia. It also indicates that these changes in practices – the disruption and acquired significance – contribute to children’s reconceptualisation of their relationship with their parent. This article seeks to add to the literature on <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> (Morgan, 2011) and display (Finch, 2007) by using the experience of dementia to illustrate the importance of <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> when a <b>family</b> experiences ‘crisis’. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether environmental factors and practice characteristics influence {{the existence of}} patient-centered medical home elements in <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> in Virginia.

A negative association was found between competition and medical home elements. Medicare and managed care penetration were not associated with medical home elements.

40|$|<b>Family</b> <b>Practices,</b> Law and the Construction of Differences (15 th- 19 th centuries). B. Derouet. Should {{one look}} to the {{regional}} diversity in private law under the Old Regime to explain the variety of <b>family</b> <b>practices</b> in France during this period? These two forms of diversity, however, cannot be entirely superimposed, nor do they correspond term for term. In reality, the difference between law and social practices cannot simply {{be understood in terms}} of respect for or transgression of specific norms, {{but in terms of the}} categories which the law uses to formalize these practices, make sense of them and confer upon them a certain legitimacy. Several examples show that certain kinds of law, with the same basic principles, were able to serve in cases of strikingly different <b>family</b> <b>practices.</b> The relationship between these two levels is less a problem of direct reflexion or influence but that of translation.
