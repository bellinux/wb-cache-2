This phenomenon provided a more intimate mixing in binary composites, yielding a higher dispersion, allowing ZrO 2 particles to be present mostly at grain boundaries, without agglomerates. Thus, the prepared samples were fully densified with small isolated voids, as shown in Figure 2 c.|$|R

Mathematical modeling and thermodynamic properties of coffee mois-ture adsorption process were accomplished. It was concluded that particle size didnot signiﬁcantly affect water content of coffee, independently of roast degree. Sigma-Copace model best represented hygroscopic equilibrium of roasted coffee.

Analysis of the results leads to the following conclusions: width variations of the opposition surge can be related to differences in porosity or grain size distribution on the various domains, with little or no effect from suspended dust. As the biggest effects are observed on dark and bright materials, intermediate behaviors on average-bright regions cannot result from a mixing process, but are more likely to come from either cementation processes or modification of the grain size distribution under the influence of wind, which under Martian conditions preferentially removes the biggest particles.
