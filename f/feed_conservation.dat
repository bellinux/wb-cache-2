40|$|AbstractWe {{assessed}} land use/land cover {{changes from}} remotely sensed satellite imagery and compared this with community perceptions on availability/use of livestock feed resources and feed deficit management strategies since the 1973 s in three districts representing the pastoral, agro-pastoral and mixed crop-livestock eco-environments of Ethiopia. We found that land use/land cover changes are proceeding in all eco-environments and that transitions are from grasslands, and forest lands to bush/shrub lands and crop {{lands in the}} pastoral site (Liben), from bush/shrub lands and grasslands to crop lands in agro-pastoral site (Mieso) and from bush/shrub lands, forest lands and grasslands to crop lands in the mixed crop-livestock site (Tiyo). The changes significantly affected livestock feed resources and feed deficit management strategies available to households. Over the last 30 – 40 years, grazing resources available to livestock keepers have been declining with resultant increase in the contribution of crop residues and other feeds from crop lands (weeds and crop thinnings) as compared to feeds from grasslands. The feed deficit management strategies of households are also changing significantly from mobility to herd management and <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> in the pastoral areas; from mobility to <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> and purchasing of feed in the agro-pastoral areas and from transhumance to <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> and purchase of feed in the mixed crop-livestock areas. Hence feed resources and their availability vary with time and eco-environments indicating {{the need for the}} development of eco-environment/site specific feed management strategies in order to support productive stock in the study areas and similar eco-environments...|$|E

40|$|Smallholder {{dairy farmers}} in {{developing}} countries face many feed constraints such as inadequate feed quality and quantity, poor storage facilities for <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> as well as insufficient water. However, feeding of livestock continues to pose many problems {{due to lack of}} information on composition and utilization of locally available feed resources. These problems are aggravated by lack of access to and high cost of feed inputs. The use of cheap and readily available local feed resources has great potential to increase livestock productivity. The East African Dairy Development project in Kenya, through use of various participatory rapid appraisal tools conducted a rapid appraisal study of three project areas. The objective was to assess feeds and feeding practices in smallholder dairy systems, identify feed resources available year round and where the gaps are as well as to determine what practices are available for improving production and utilization of feed resources in order to raise smallholder dairy production. Established opportunities for improvement include on-farm production and utilization of fodder, efficient storage, processing and utilization of crop residues, pasture improvement, appropriate water harvesting technologies, formulation of feed rations amongst small scale farmers, small scale <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> as well as development of fodder markets. Given the complex farming system within which smallholder farmers operate, changes are needed in both the technologies used for improving feeds and feeding systems and in the institutional and policy arrangements surrounding feed supply. In addition, technical interventions need to be developed in a participatory manner along with farmers and other stakeholders within the system to make them relevant and sustainable...|$|E

40|$|Agroecosystems play an {{important}} role in providing economic and ecosystem services, which directly impact society. Inappropriate land use and unsustainable agricultural management with associated nutrient cycles can jeopardize important soil functions such as food production, livestock <b>feeding,</b> and <b>conservation</b> of biodiversity. The objective of this study was to integrate remotely sensed land cover information into a regional land management model (LMM) to improve the assessment of spatially explicit nutrient balances for agroecosystems. Remotely sensed data and an optimized parameter set contributed to an improved LMM output, allowing for a better land allocation within the model. The best input parameter combination was based on two different land cover classifications with overall accuracies of 98 %, improving the land allocation performance compared with using nonspatially explicit input. We conclude that the combined use of remote sensing data and the LMM has the potential to provide valuable guidance for farm practices. It further helps to generate a spatial description of farm-level nutrient balance, a crucial ability when choosing policy options related to sustainable management of agricultural soils...|$|R

A completely randomized design, with four treatment and six replicates was used and this study. Four treatment consisting of cassava meal were supplemented in each ration at graded level of 0 %, 10 %, 20 %, and 30 %. Each treatment contains 22. 5 % protein and 3000 cal/kg ration metabolized energy. The result showed {{there were no}} significant effects of the four level of cassava meal on body weight, feed consumption, feed conservasion, percentage of abdominal fat. The average body weight for each treatment was 1508. 91, 1454. 99, 1417. 31 and 1401. 95 gram, respectively. <b>Feed</b> <b>conservation</b> was 1. 72, 1. 72, 1. 72 and 1. 74 gram, respectively.

In 2012, {{it was reported that}} the unsanctioned flight of light aircraft from adjacent islands was disrupting the reproductive and social behaviors of the species. Via Verde, a gas pipeline grid proposed by the Luis Fortuño administration, raised concerns among conservationists due to further deforestation of the regions where the birds <b>feed.</b> New <b>conservation</b> efforts have also begun during this timeframe. In 2011, a research team of the University of Puerto Rico at Mayagüez sequenced the amazon's genome. On August 15, 2013, the discovery of non-assisted nests in the Río Abajo State Forest was announced. Experts considered this a sign of expansion, impliying that the reintroduced amazon population was fully adapting to wild life and was dispersing throughout the region. This was noted as a significant advance, since El Yunque is not an ideal habitat for the bird due to its humidity, which precipitates sickness in some of the individuals. This was accompanied by a second announcement, which noted that added to the known number of amazons in the wild (fluctuating between 64 and 112 specimens) there is an unmonitored population of approximately 50 birds dispersed throughout Puerto Rico.|$|R

Two hundred forty 1 -day-old commercial Arbor Acres broilers were randomly assigned to 4 groups: CON group (fed basal diets), SB group (fed basal diet with 0. 05 % sodium butyrate), CLI group (fed basal diet with 1 % clinoptilolite), and CLI-B group (fed basal diet with 1 % CLI-B). The results showed that supplementation of CLI-B significantly decreased (P < 0. 05) <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> ratio at both 21 and 42 days of age, improved the pancreatic digestive enzymes activities (P < 0. 05), increased the villus length and villus/crypt ratio (P < 0. 05), and decreased the crypt depth of intestine (P < 0. 05) as compared to the other experimental groups. Furthermore, the CLI-B environment improved the antioxidant capacity by increasing the antioxidant enzyme activities (P < 0. 05) in intestine mucosal, and decreasing the NO content and iNOS activity (P < 0. 05) in serum. In addition, CLI-B supplementation had improved the development of intestine and antioxidant capacity of broilers than supplementation with either clinoptilolite or butyrate sodium alone. In conclusion, 1 % CLI-B supplementation improved the health status, intestine development and antioxidant capacity in broiler chickens, thus appearing as an important feed additive for the poultry industry...|$|E
40|$|Chicken coccidiosis, {{caused by}} Eimeria spp., occurs {{in almost all}} poultry farms and causes huge {{economic}} losses in the poultry industry. Although this disease could be controlled by vaccination, the reduced <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> ratio limits the widespread application of anticoccidial vaccines in broilers because some intermediate and/or low immunogenic Eimeria spp. only elicit partial protection. It is of importance to enhance the immunogenicity of these Eimeria spp. by adjuvants for more effective prevention of coccidiosis. Cytokines have remarkable effects on the immunogenicity of antigens. Interleukin 2 (IL- 2), for example, significantly stimulates the activation of CD 8 + T cells and other immune cells. In this study, we constructed a transgenic Eimeria mitis line (EmiChIL- 2) expressing chicken IL- 2 (ChIL- 2) to investigate the adjuvant effect of ChIL- 2 to enhance the immunogenicity of E. mitis against its infection. Stable transfected EmiChIL- 2 population was obtained by pyrimethamine selection and verified by PCR, genome walking, western blotting and indirect immunofluorescence assay. Cellular immune response, E. mitis-specific IFN-γ secretion lymphocytes in the peripheral blood mononuclear cells, stimulated by EmiChIL- 2 was analyzed by enzyme-linked immunospot assay (ELISPOT). The results showed that EmiChIL- 2 stimulated a higher cellular immune response {{compared with that of}} the wild-type parasite infection in chickens. Moreover, after the immunization with EmiChIL- 2, elevated cellular immune response as well as reduced oocyst output were observed These results indicated that ChIL- 2 expressed by Eimeria spp. functions as adjuvant and IL- 2 expressing Eimeria parasites are valuable vaccine strains against coccidiosis...|$|E

ABSTRACT: This study was carried out to assess the types, sources, seasonality and marketing practices of feed, and the feeding practices of dairy cattle. Irrespective of locational and seasonal variation, basal diets like commonly natural pastures (grasses, legumes, herbs, shrubs and trees foliage) and recently crop residues (straws of teff, wheat, maize and sorghum, haulms of haricot beans) were available in lowland. Straws of barely, vines of sweet potato, and by-products of banana and Enset were exclusive to mid-highland along with above mentioned. Industrial by-products apt for enhancing dairy cattle productivity were commonly purchased during prolonged dry season and drought outbreak of both agro-ecologies. Standing hay (Kallo) and collected pods of acacia trees in lowland, and piled hay and crop residue in mid-highland area were means of <b>feed</b> <b>conservation.</b> During the dry season, adult cattle of lowland and mid-highland area were, respectively, walking an average of 7. 75 km and 4. 5 km in search of drinking water. Calves, lactating cows and bulls were the first, second and third locally prioritized categories of dairy cattle for supplementation. It will be paramount to quantitatively estimate the annual production potential, and wisely utilize the prevailing feed resources and design the strategy to avail water for boosting the dairy cattle productivity.

40|$|A {{system of}} pasture yield {{measurement}} {{was developed for}} New Zealand’s pasture based, rotationally grazed farming systems. Pasture yield measurement is complex because the pasture biomass has to be measured in-situ, pre and post grazing so that pasture consumption and utilisation can be calculated. The “C-Dax Pasture Meter ” was initially developed by Massey University and subsequently commercialised by C-Dax Ltd of New Zealand. The pasture management solution has gained traction in the market-place and is considered a valuable management tool for dairy farmers in New Zealand and Australia. The method of measurement is simple but highly effective and provides reliable measurement of pasture cover {{in a range of}} pasture types regardless of weather and light conditions. The measurement unit is pulled behind an ATV and can be used at speeds of up to 20 kmh- 1. Two technology levels are available, either as a basic system deriving average cover for individual paddocks, or with the incorporation of a GPS to allow pasture production to be mapped. Recent independent calibration results from New Zealand based research organisations have shown the C-Dax Pasture Meter to have a higher level of accuracy than traditionally used methods as well as increased utility. The system has also proved to be reliable in measuring post grazing residual levels which are known as Key Performance Indicators (KPI’s) to achieving good pasture management and maintaining pasture quality. Measuring pasture covers allows farmers to make timely decisions regarding <b>feed</b> <b>conservation,</b> fertiliser use and stocking policies as well as giving farmers greater certainty in budgeting feed resources.

40|$|Availability {{and access}} to feed {{resources}} are important constraints to livestock productivity in East Africa. This study examined the production and marketing of livestock feeds in Central and North Rift regions in Kenya. Looking at existing fodder value chains to assess constraints and opportunities using the value chain approach, a rapid reconnaissance survey was conducted in which 93 actors were interviewed along the value chain in November 2010. Fodder marketing takes place at two levels: location (a cluster of 2 - 3 villages) and district. Trading at location level involved input sellers, producers selling directly to rural retailers, rural consumers, or if they were near major district towns, to wholesalers. District level trading involved traders who sourced for fodder outside the district and retailed to wholesalers in major consumer markets within districts {{and to a lesser}} extend retailed in local areas. Service providers such as transporters and feed processors operated at all levels. Input providers comprised of agrovet and general retail shops. Traders comprised of individual traders and cooperative societies. Feed trading is seasonal commonly occurring during the dry season with seasonal price variations at all levels. Feed price have increased by about 15 % within the past year. In all the sites, local feed markets are dominated by livestock keepers selling excess fodder. There are few “specialized” fodder sellers, i. e. non livestock keepers who grew fodder as a source of income. Commonly traded feeds in the dry season were Rhodes grass, maize stovers, oat straws and Lucerne hay that were preferred due to longer storage period. Others forages were Napier grass and roadside harvested grass. Most traded fodder had low gross margins (GM) although foodfeed crops such as oats, sweet potato, etc tended to have higher GM. Actors reported an increasing demand for purchased fodder although they all operated in uncoordinated manner. Cooperative societies {{played a key role in}} linking buyers and sellers, stimulating demand and providing credit. Lack of input capital is perceived as a major constraint more than lack of market because demand for feed is strong during the dry season. This study concludes that there is need to promote feed marketing as a package alongside <b>feed</b> <b>conservation,</b> feed processing as well creating platform for that provide linkages for all actors to operate in coordinated way.

40|$|Utilizaram-se 144 leitões mestiços, sendo 72 machos castrados e 72 fêmeas, com peso médio inicial de 6, 91 kg ± 1, 32 kg, aos 28 dias de idade, para determinar o efeito da adição ou não de duas fontes de lipídeos (óleo de soja e gordura de coco), em diferentes níveis (2, 4, 6 e 8 %), sobre o desempenho (ganho de peso médio diário, consumo de ração médio diário e conversão alimentar). O delineamento utilizado foi o DBC, em um arranjo fatorial 2 x 4 (fontes x níveis) e um tratamento adicional (ração controle, sem adição de lipídeo). As rações experimentais foram isocalóricas, isoprotéicas e isolisínicas, formuladas à base de milho, farelo de soja, farinha de peixe e leite em pó desnatado, suplementadas com minerais, vitaminas e lisina. Não houve interação significativa entre as fontes e níveis testados (P> 0, 05), para nenhum dos parâmetros de desempenho estudados. Não se observou diferença significativa (P> 0, 05) no ganho de peso médio diário de leitões que receberam ou não óleo de soja ou gordura de coco, nos diferentes níveis. Comparando-se em conjunto as médias dos tratamentos (2, 4, 6, 8 % de óleo de soja e de gordura de coco), com a ração-controle (sem adição de lipídeo), foram observados maior (P A {{total of}} 144 {{crossbred}} piglets were utilized, being 72 castrated males and 72 females, with average initial weight of 6. 91 kg ± 1. 32 kg, at 28 days old, {{to determine the}} effect of the addition or not of two sources of lipids (soybean oil and coconut oil) at different levels (2, 4, 6 and 8 %) over pigs performance (daily average weight gain, daily average feed intake and feed conversion). It was utilized a randomized block design using a factorial arrangement 2 x 4 (sources and oils levels) and an additional treatment (control ration without lipids addition). The experimental rations were isocaloric, isoprotein and isolysine, formulated based on corn, soybean meal, skimmed milk powder fish meal supplemented with minerals, vitamins and lysine. There was no significant interaction between sources and oils levels tested (P> 0. 05) for none of the performance parameters studied. Significant difference was not observed (P> 0. 05) in the daily average weight gain of pigs receiving or not soybean oil or coconut oil, in different levels. Comparing the means of treatments (2, 4, 6, 8 % soybean oil and coconut oil) with the control ration (without lipid addition), it was observed larger (P< 0. 01) daily average feed intake and worse (P< 0. 01) <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> when lipid was not added to the diet. The addition of lipids in the piglets diets is beneficial due to smaller ration intake for a same weigh gain and better feed conversion...|$|E
40|$|The {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Metema District of Amhara Region and the objectives of the study were to assess the major livestock feed resources, to analyze the chemical composition of major feeds, to assess the rangeland condition and investigate the floristic composition and dry matter biomass yields of herbaceous species in the District. The livestock feed resources were assessed by formal and informal survey and analyzed by descriptive statistics. In the assessment range condition, grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, soil erosion, soil compaction, seedling count, age distribution and woody density enumeration, canopy cover and hedging effect were collected and analyzed by GLM and LSD is used for mean comparison. The chemical analysis of the major feeds, a statistical model Yij= μ + Si + Lj + eij were used. Natural pasture (55. 7 %), crop residues (20. 7 %), stubble (14. 3 %) and hay (9. 3 %) were the major feed resources for dry season where as in the wet season, only natural pasture serves as feed resource. The estimated feeds from crop residues (827. 16) ton DM per annum, grazing land and stubble (780750 and (51954) ton DM per annum could be obtained, respectively and total estimated available feed supply was 833531. 16 ton DM per annum. Crop residues utilization, hay making and amount of supplementation is not appropriate. 33 herbaceous species were identified; of these, 14 and 19 were different grasses and non-grass species. From the non-grass species 6 legumes and 13 sedges and others species were recorded. Of the grasses, 23. 07 %, 38. 46 % and 30. 77 % were highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. Of the identified 20 woody species, 15 %, 35 %, and 50 % were highly desirable, desirable and less desirable, respectively. The height of 41. 2 % of trees and shrubs in communal grazing areas, 38. 5 % in road side grazing and 33. 3 % in enclosed areas were grouped within the height class of (1 - 3 m). The range condition assessment factors (basal cover, litter cover, grass species composition, woody vegetation density, canopy cover, hedging effect, age distribution and total condition score) in communal grazing areas of SBFS were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than CBFS. The grass species composition, basal cover, litter cover, age distribution, and woody species density score in enclosed areas had a significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than in communal grazing areas and roadside grazing areas. The total grass biomass, highly desirable grasses, desirable grasses species and legumes and others in the SBFS were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher than in the CBFS. The total dry matter biomass, dry matter biomass of grass and highly desirable grasses, and legumes were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the enclosed areas than the communal and the road side grazing areas. The finding {{of this study indicate that}} the rangeland condition of communal and roadside grazing areas of the district need rehabilitation, proper management and regulatory activity. The duration and managements of <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> and amounts of supplementation should be improved. Canadian International Development Agenc...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we are {{concerned}} with some economic aspects {{of the use of}} artificial nitrogen fertilisers in New Zealand agriculture. With the prospect of much cheaper nitrogen fertiliser in the future (and possibly more expensive phosphatic fertiliser), some agriculturalists looking well to the future have suggested that New Zealand should and will move progressively towards systems of farming which are much more dependent than at present on nitrogenous fertilisers. The most comprehensively argued approach comes from Dr K. J. Mitchell, Director of the Plant Physiology Division of the New Zealand Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. In a number of recent papers [14, 15] he has argued that fertiliser nitrogen should be progressively substituted for clover as a source of nitrogen in New Zealand agriculture. Also, this should be coupled with a change in farming systems away from conventional clover based pasture towards continuous cropping and storage of maize and annual winter ryegrass. Though we propose in the paper to touch on some of the wider aspects of nitrogen use, our attention will be concentrated mainly on Dr Mitchell's suggested system which is important enough to justify a preliminary economic appraisal. In subjecting Dr Mitchell's proposals to a critical economic appraisal, we are not indulging in the negative criticism that is so often implied when criteria of profit and loss are applied to a new and important idea. Indeed, we started out with the contrary hope, namely that we would find increased profits or reduction in costs in the suggested new approach. At the least we felt that an economic appraisal of this sort would lay bare just where the economic advantages and disadvantages of the nitrogen storage system lay by comparison with conventional systems of producing livestock fodder. Also, in what directions further technical research should proceed if the maximum cost reductions or profit increases were to be achieved. In tackling this subject we have laboured under two major disadvantages. The first concerns the fact that there does not exist a great volume of research data relating to the agronomy of nitrogen fertiliser in New Zealand, especially in relation to grassland. Thus we have had to fall back in many cases on the opinions and guesses of agricultural scientists with whom we have discussed the matter. The second problem is that there is very little data available on costs of production of conventional pasture and, imperfect as our methods are, we found it necessary to tackle this question first, in order to provide a bench mark against which to compare the production costs of the new technology. We proceed as follows: In Section II we discuss the economics of conventional clover based pasture production. This is followed in Section III by a brief description and case study of a Mitchell type farm, and in Section IV by an economic appraisal of both this and other types of farms. In Section V the original budgets are recalculated to give return to land rather than the conventional return to capital. Some general criticisms are given in Section VI, followed in Section VII with a discussion of costs of <b>feed</b> <b>conservation</b> and storage of alternatives. Some alternative nitrogen using approaches are canvassed in. Section VIII before the whole matter is summed up in the concluding Section IX...|$|E
40|$|Sesbania sesban {{is one of}} {{the exotic}} {{multipurpose}} fodder trees introduced in the Ethiopian highlands for livestock <b>feed</b> and soil <b>conservation.</b> Several on-station studies showed that supplementation with Sesbania improved intake and digestibility of basal diet and growth rate of animals. However, information about farmers' feeding practices of Sesbania and farmers' perception of the effect of Sesbania feeding on animal performance is limited. The present study was conducted to assess farmers' feeding practices and their perception about effects of Sesbania supplementation on sheep performance in annual (one wheat-based (WheatCL) and one teff-based (TeffCL)) and perennial (coffee-based (CoffeeCL)) crop-based livestock systems in the Ethiopian Highlands. Data were collected from 98 households by interviews using a structured questionnaire. Farmers had on average 6. 9 years of experience using Sesbania as a cut and carry supplementary feed. Farmers in the WheatCL and TeffCL fed Sesbania throughout the dry season while farmers in the CoffeeCL had no specific season for feeding Sesbania. Farmers in WheatCL and TeffCL offered significantly (...|$|R
5000|$|A {{profitable}} ecotourism {{industry has}} arisen around this species involving organized [...] "shark feeds", in which groups of reef sharks {{are attracted to}} divers using bait. Some US$6,000,000 is spent annually on shark viewing in the Bahamas, where at some sites a single living Caribbean reef shark has a value between US$13,000 and US$40,000 (compared to a one-time value of US$50 - 60 for a dead shark). This practice has drawn controversy, as opponents argue that the sharks may learn to associate humans with food, increasing {{the chances of a}} shark attack, and that the removal of reef fishes for bait may damage the local ecosystem. Conversely, proponents maintain that shark <b>feeds</b> contribute to <b>conservation</b> by incentivizing the protection of sharks and educating people about them. Thus far, there has been little evidence that shark feeds have increased the risk of attack in the surrounding area. Shark feeding has been outlawed off the coast of Florida, but continues at other locations in the Caribbean.|$|R
30|$|Remote sensing {{along with}} {{household}} surveys is an innovative approach to assess farm system dynamics. LULC change, grain production pressure, and pressure on feed resources {{are the three}} major indicators that measure land conversion and food and <b>feed</b> balance. <b>Conservation</b> structures, woodlands, water resources, irrigation activities, afro-alpine reserves, access to road and local market, and recently introduced practices—such as highland fruits, malt barley seeds, tree lucerne seedlings, and improved animal breeds—are important interventions to improve land productivity, economic gains, and food security. Increased numbers of endangered tree species, high grazing pressure, and intensive land conversions are, however, potential threats to enhance the management of improved land resources. Settlement and plantation have increased tremendously, {{in line with the}} increasing human population. The rising population is also causing a concomitant shrinkage in natural vegetation. If the underlying crop-livestock dynamics affecting the system remain unchanged, competition for land resources and environmental damage is certain to accelerate. This situation warrants further investment in sustainable land resource management and efficient institutional arrangements that can preserve the natural landscape and minimize the extent of crop-livestock competition. Promoting multipurpose forage and crop varieties could provide enough biomass {{to meet the needs of}} humans and livestock as well as enhance soil fertility. Increasing crop production alone will not be sufficient to meet the farmers’ animal feed. We conclude that the adoption of improved forages and fodder species and better integrating crop-livestock production can sustainably alleviate human food and animal feed demands in the highlands of Ethiopia.|$|R
