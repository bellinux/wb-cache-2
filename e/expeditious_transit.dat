50|$|Transit {{passage is}} a concept of the Law of the Sea, which allows a vessel or {{aircraft}} the freedom of navigation or overflight solely {{for the purpose of}} continuous and <b>expeditious</b> <b>transit</b> of a strait between one part of the high seas or exclusive economic zone and another. The requirement of continuous and <b>expeditious</b> <b>transit</b> does not preclude passage through the strait for the purpose of entering, leaving or returning from a state bordering the strait, subject to the conditions of entry to that state.|$|E
5000|$|Agreeing an {{amendment}} to the Palau Arrangement Purse-seine Vessel Days Management Scheme that provides a clear and unambiguous definition of the Fishing Day. In particular, clarifying that any calendar day in which any fishing activity takes place will be counted as a full fishing day, with limited exemptions for days in which the only activities during that day are bona-fide emergencies, breakdowns, refuelling, repairs, or <b>expeditious</b> <b>transit</b> with fully stowed fishing gear.|$|E
40|$|In {{cooperation}} with David Mastronarde at the Boulder Laboratory for 3 D Electron Microscopy of Cells, {{we have developed}} methods for high resolution, large area ET of thick, stained plastic sections for the 3 D reconstruction and analysis of mammalian membrane architecture at high fidelity in the insulin-secreting beta cells of the endocrine pancreas. This approach, when employed in conjunction with high-pressure freezing and freeze-substitution, has allowed us to generate tomograms of comparatively large cellular volumes (each typically measuring at least 4 × 4 × 0. 4 μm) with which to study the key organelles and compartments involved in the synthesis, processing, and trafficking of insulin with unprecedented reliability. These data have afforded us new insights into beta cell biology and function that include: (1) the complexity of structural relationships among the Golgi, ER, and compartments of the endosomal-lysosomal system (Marsh et al., 2001 a); (2) evidence that multiple transport mechanisms act in concert in the same region of the Golgi ribbon (Marsh et al., 2001 b); (3) a role for the ER in regulating membrane traffic/sorting at the trans-Golgi, the presumptive site where proinsulin is sorted and packaged into nascent secretory granules (Marsh et al., 2001 a,b); (4) evidence that multiple, distinct trans-cisternae, frequently {{referred to as the}} TGN, detach and fragment as membrane is consumed in the process of packaging secretory cargo for exit (Marsh et al., 2001 a); and (5) the unequivocal demonstration of direct intra-Golgi connections that facilitate "cisternal bypass" to provide a continuous lumen for the <b>expeditious</b> <b>transit</b> of Golgi traffic (Marsh et al., 2004) ...|$|E
