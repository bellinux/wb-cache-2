He was interested on Guayaki because there were a <b>few</b> <b>researches</b> on them since Alfredo Stroessner's dictatorship forced them to live under territorial restriction and launched a pacifying campaign between 1959 and 1962. In the book, the author describes Guayaki culture {{with a focus on}} their cycle of life and their [...] "daily struggles for survival." [...] He describes their mores on rites of passage, marriage, hunting, warfare, and death, as well as their relation with non-Indian people and nature. In 1976 Paul Auster, then a [...] "penniless unknown", translated the book into English but it was only {{published in}} 1998 by Zone Books.

Martin Kay's [...] "proper" [...] paper 1After the ALPAC {{report in}} 1966, the {{conclusion}} was made as [...] "There is no immediate or predictable prospect of useful MT producing useful translation of general scientific texts." [...] 2 And {{because of this}} result, the field of machine translation entered into a dark period. From 1966 to 1976, almost ten years, <b>few</b> <b>researches</b> were done. However, in 1980s, the Renaissance period was coming. 3 [...] "The Proper Place of Men and Machines in Language Translation" [...] attracted more attention on the machine translation. In this paper, new thoughts were achieved {{about the relationship between}} machine translation and human translation. At that time, with the application of cheaper computers and broad usage of domains in machine translation, high quality outputs were badly needed. And the theory of Fully Automatic High Quality Translation was just the ideal level for machine translation after the criticisms by Bar-Hillel in his 1960s review of MT progress: “The goal of MT should not be the fully automatic high quality translation (FAHQT) that can replace human translators. Instead, MT should adopt less ambitious goals, e.g. more cost-effective human-machine interaction and aim at enhancement of human translation productivity.” 4 The useful of human translation was promoted to a new higher level. According to this thought, Martin Kay proposed a more practical idea about the relationship between human and machine in the process of machine translation, called [...] "translator's amanuensis".|$|E
