Originally a home section, the Oak Road End {{was turned into a}} stand for away fans only {{at the start of the}} 1991–92 season. Early in the 2013–14 season, the Oak Road End was re-opened for home supporters for fixtures where visiting support was predicted to be especially low, with the section for away fans moved to A Block of the Kenilworth Stand for these games. Later that season, it was announced that the stand was available for shared use between both home and away supporters, increasing Kenilworth Road's home capacity by 15%. The Oak Road End has an entrance that is often considered unusual, requiring spectators to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> entrance built into the row of houses and up stairs to the stand.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Cyclone Lin (RSMC Nadi designation: 14F, JTWC Designation: 15P) {{formed on}} March 31, 2009 as a {{tropical}} depression within a monsoon trough {{to the northwest}} of Fiji. Over the next few days, the depression moved towards the southeast through the Fijian archipelago until late on April 3, when the Regional Specialized Meteorological Center in Nadi reported that the depression had intensified into a category one cyclone, and named it Lin. The JTWC did not start issuing warnings on Lin {{until the next day}} as it was approaching its 10-minute peak windspeeds of 110km/h (70mph) and 1-minute peak windspeeds of 100km/h (65mph). Cyclone Lin then reached its peak windspeeds early on April 5 as it passed directly over Tonga. Later that day as it approached the edge of RSMC Nadi's area of responsibility Lin started to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> extratropical transition with the JTWC issuing their last advisory on it. As it crossed into TCWC Wellington's area of responsibility the cyclone was declared extratropical, however TCWC Wellington kept issuing warnings on Lin until late on April 8.|$|E

25|$|The entire {{decision-making}} process surrounding the stadium, including its design and cost, was heavily criticised, both by supporters, {{media and the}} political opposition in Gothenburg. Points of criticism included the big mystery making and hastiness around the decision, the lack of visions including the tight budget, and the involvement of too much politics in the process. Some of the criticism was addressed: the budget was increased slightly to allow closed corners, but several issues were never discussed. One such issue was having Brøndby Stadion as an inspiration for the stadium, since this arena later had to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> overhaul since the commercial areas were deemed insufficient.|$|E

Unlike the other colleges at CMU, where switching between undergraduate programs within the student's currently enrolled college is relatively straightforward, switching to a different school within CFA often requires the student <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> application process similar to that of a High School student.

25|$|Admission {{for senior}} high schools, {{especially}} selective high schools, is somewhat {{similar to the}} one for universities in China. Students will <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> application system where they may choose the high schools at which they wish to study in an order to their preference before the high schools set out their entrance requirements. Once this is completed and the high schools will announce their requirements based on this information and the places they will offer in that year. For instance, if the school offers 800 places in that year, the results offered by the 800th intake student will be the standard requirements. So effectively, this ensures the school selects the top candidates in all the students who have applied to said school in that academic year. However, the severe competition only occurs in the very top high schools, normally, most students will have sufficient results for them to continue their secondary education if they wish to.|$|E
25|$|The 2012–13 season saw a {{more stable}} squad than had been seen by Grimsby Town in recent years, {{with a total of}} 12 players from the {{previous}} season's squad remaining. The previous season's top scorer Liam Hearn suffered an Achilles tendon injury in pre-season, and although he appeared to be on the road to recovery when he came on as a substitute against Stockport County, just three days later he injured his leg in training, and tests showed it was an Achilles tendon rupture and he would be out for several months. However, despite the loss of such an important player, and despite not winning 5 games into the season, Grimsby were top of the table by Christmas, with two crucial loan players Ross Hannah and Scott Neilson breathing new life into the Grimsby team. The turn of the year, however, appeared to be a turning point for Grimsby, with Nathan Pond returning from loan to Fleetwood Town and Scott Neilson signing for league rivals Luton Town. The team appeared to lack the quality they had shown {{towards the end of the}} previous year, and despite not losing until mid-February, a run of 4 consecutive losses in March saw them give up the top spot and ultimately fall away from the title race. Despite this, they reached the FA Trophy final, where they played Wrexham at Wembley Stadium on 24 March 2013. Grimsby went ahead in the second half with 20 minutes left to <b>go,</b> <b>through</b> <b>an</b> Andy Cook strike. However, they conceded a penalty with 9 minutes left and Wrexham equalised. This took the game to extra time, and then penalties, where Grimsby lost the shoot-out 4–1. Grimsby finished the season in good form, with a 9 match unbeaten run, finishing the season with a 3–0 win against Newport County. This led them to finish in 4th place with 83 points. They faced Newport County again straight away in the play-off semi-finals, where they were knocked out by a 1–0 loss in both legs. The managerial duo was broken up on 6 September 2013 due to Rob Scott being suspended and Paul Hurst was placed in sole charge of the team.|$|E
