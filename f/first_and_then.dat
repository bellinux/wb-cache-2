Alabama opened the scoring with a 28-yard Jeremy Shelley field goal in the <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> scored a trio of second-quarter touchdowns. Mark Ingram scored on runs of six and one—yard with the third coming on a 19-yard Marquis Maze touchdown pass to Michael Williams on a wide receiver pass. Florida got on the board late in the second with a 39-yard Chas Henry field goal to bring the halftime score to 24–3. After a second Henry field goal, C. J. Mosley returned an interception 35-yards for a touchdown to make the final score 31–6.|$|E
5|$|In the Kalika Purana, Varaha - Vishnu’s boar avatar - had amorous dalliance {{with the}} earth goddess. He and his three boar sons then created mayhem in the world, which necessitated Shiva to {{take the form of}} Sharabha, to kill the Varaha form. Even, Vishnu {{requests}} Shiva to destroy Varaha, unable to control his own form. Here, Narasimha appears to aid Varaha. Sharabha kills Narasimha <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> kills Varaha, allowing Vishnu to reabsorb the energies of both his fierce forms. Finally, Vishnu defeats Sharabha.|$|E

5|$|San Martín {{proposed}} to mediate between Buenos Aires and the Federal League led by Artigas. He {{thought that the}} civil war was counter-productive to national unity, and that an end to hostilities would free resources needed for the navy. He calculated that Artigas might condition the peace on a joint declaration of war to colonial Brazil; so San Martín {{proposed to}} defeat the royalists <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> demand {{the return of the}} Eastern Bank to the United Provinces. O'Higgins recommended caution, fearing that San Martín might be captured. Pueyrredón rejected the mediation, as he did not recognize Artigas as an equal to negotiate with him.|$|E
5|$|The first {{match was}} {{played at the}} end of the Australian tour of England in 1884, and was held at Lord's in aid of the Cricketers' Fund Friendly Society. Eight of the {{tourists}} took part; four on each side. The Non-Smokers batted <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> forced their opponents to follow on, aided by a strong batting performance from George Bonnor. The Smokers, batting twice, only finished thirteen runs ahead, a total which was chased down without the need for the scheduled third day of the contest.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} African nations {{did not show}} up in time, for various reasons such as {{difficulties}} flying through Istanbul, and finalisation of monetary arrangements (teams must pay <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> get reimbursed later). Former Kenyan Olympic participant and owner of the website Kenya Chess Masala said that the issue just paints Africa in bad image. On 5 September, the organisers confirmed at a press-conference that the host-nation was ready to pay for the poorer nations to travel. Bhari confirmed that the travel expenses were the main problem and wrote that 116 out of the planned 187 federations were on a travel subsidy, including his native Kenya whose players had not shown in the first rounds, though. He also explained that one of the biggest issues was the timing of the funding and that the teams were expected to pay on their own and be reimbursed upon arrival. Finally, Bhari had already reminded other federations to start planning their travel expenses for the 43rd Chess Olympiad in Batumi in 2018. In the end, 10 African nations did not arrive (Kenya, Cameroon, Mali, Rwanda, Sierra Leone, Burundi, Liberia, Seychelles, Senegal, Central African Republic).|$|E
5|$|Chelsea {{have only}} had one home ground, Stamford Bridge, where they have played since the team's foundation. It was officially opened on 28 April 1877 {{and for the first}} 28 years of its {{existence}} it was used almost exclusively by the London Athletic Club as an arena for athletics meetings and not at all for football. In 1904 the ground was acquired by businessman Gus Mears and his brother Joseph, who had also purchased nearby land (formerly a large market garden) with the aim of staging football matches on the now 12.5acre (51,000m²) site. Stamford Bridge was designed for the Mears family by the noted football architect Archibald Leitch, who had also designed Ibrox, Craven Cottage and Hampden Park. Most football clubs were founded <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> sought grounds in which to play, but Chelsea were founded for Stamford Bridge.|$|E
5|$|In each {{of their}} {{following}} two matches, at home against Hampshire and away to Worcestershire, Somerset batted <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> enforced the follow-on after bowling their opponents out cheaply. In each their opponents managed to avoid defeat, and both matches resulted in draws. During the Worcestershire match, Langer's first innings 107 took him past Sir Donald Bradman's total of 28,067 first-class runs to become the highest-scoring Australian batsman. Successive draws against Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Sussex and Hampshire meant that Somerset travelled to Durham requiring a victory to maintain any realistic hopes of claiming the County Championship title. No play was possible on {{the third and fourth}} days, and the match resulted in another draw, leaving Somerset with only a slim mathematical chance of the title. Another draw, against Lancashire, while Durham beat Nottinghamshire, meant that Durham clinched the title. Somerset drew with Worcestershire (their ninth draw in a row in the competition), and finished third in the first division.|$|E

5|$|Relatively new {{cells in}} a groove {{on the edges}} of the mantle secrete {{material}} that extends the periostracum. These cells are gradually displaced to the underside of the mantle by more recent cells in the groove, and switch to secreting the mineralized material of the shell valves. In other words, {{on the edge of the}} valve the periostracum is extended <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> reinforced by extension of the mineralized layers under the periostracum. In most species the edge of the mantle also bears movable bristles, often called chaetae or setae, that may help defend the animals and may act as sensors. In some brachiopods groups of chaetae help to channel the flow of water into and out of the mantle cavity.|$|E
5|$|The most {{prominent}} temple of Varaha is the Sri Varahaswami Temple in Tirumala, Andhra Pradesh. It {{is located on}} the shores of a temple pond, called the Swami Pushkarini, in Tirumala, near Tirupati; {{to the north of the}} Tirumala Venkateswara Temple (another temple of Vishnu in the form of Venkateswara). The region is called Adi-Varaha Kshestra, the abode of Varaha. The legend of the place is as follows: at the end of Satya Yuga (the first in the cycle of four aeons; the present one is the fourth aeon), devotees of Varaha requested him to stay on earth, so Varaha ordered his mount Garuda to bring his divine garden Kridachala from his abode Vaikuntha to Venkata hills, Tirumala. Venkateswara is described as having taken the permission of Varaha to reside in these hills, where his chief temple, Tirumala Venkateswara Temple, stands. Hence, pilgrims are prescribed to worship Varaha <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> Venkateswara. In the Atri Samhita (Samurtarchanadhikara), Varaha is described to be worshipped in three forms here: Adi Varaha, Pralaya Varaha and Yajna Varaha. The image in the sanctum is of Adi Varaha.|$|E
5|$|The second common parasitoid, Elasmus polistis, {{also has}} {{disastrous}} {{effects on the}} P. exclamans nest. Up to 80 E. polistis will hatch out of a single cell. The males emerge <b>first,</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> will exit the nest and wait until the females emerge. Once the female moths emerge, the males will mate and reproduce, quickly destroying the P. exclamans population. In some cases the invading E. polistis will hide larvae in the nest so that the P.exclamans cannot find them. This {{is important to the}} survival of P.exclamans. The hosts will attempt to remove as many parasitoids as possible to prevent them from spreading to nearby nests. This defense mechanism has not been proven to be effective, as more often than not the E. polistis larvae go undetected by the hosts. In one experiment conducted, it was found that over 60% of all nests lost brood to the parasitoids E. polistis or C. iphitalis in 1981. It was also observed that larger satellites have a greater risk of being parasitized. This {{is due to the fact}} that the large nests are typically older. This relationship between age and parasitism can be seen with the fact that older queens’ nests tend to be parasitized more than younger queens’ nests.|$|E

5|$|Two {{competing}} {{theories have}} arisen {{about the cause}} of the explosion. The first is that the bomb detonated in or near the black powder magazine used for the ship's saluting guns and catapult charges. This would have detonated <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> ignited the smokeless powder magazines which was used for the ship's main armament. A 1944 Navy Bureau of Ships report suggests that a hatch leading to the black powder magazine was left open, possibly with flammable materials stocked nearby. The Naval History and Heritage Command explained that black powder might have been stockpiled outside the armored magazine. The alternative explanation is that the bomb penetrated the armored decks and detonated directly inside one of the starboard magazines for the main armament, but smokeless powder is relatively difficult to detonate. Thus the 14-inch powder bags required a black powder pad to quickly ignite the powder. The time elapsed from the bomb hit to the magazine explosion was shorter than experience suggested burning smokeless powder required to explode. It seems unlikely that a definitive answer to this question will ever be found, as the surviving physical evidence is insufficient to determine {{the cause of the}} magazine explosion.|$|E
5|$|Challenges for the {{localization}} teams include space limitation (due to {{data storage}} and/or on-screen space), achieving a natural dialogue flow despite multiple plot branches and script lines being stored out of order, and, when voiced footage is not re-recorded for lip movement, dealing with file length and lip-synch limitations. When {{the same team}} works on different games in a series such as Final Fantasy, they often need to adopt different writing styles depending on the setting of their games. Another point to consider is humorous elements that do not translate properly into English, and different cultural expectations about character interactions. The localization process depends on {{factors such as the}} development teams' wishes, as well as budget and schedule. Traditionally, translation usually started late in development or after the original Japanese release, but recent titles have been translated during initial development, making the translators appear more like additional planners or consultants and not just translators-this was the case for Final Fantasy XI, Final Fantasy XIII, Final Fantasy XIV and Final Fantasy XV. A few titles, like The Bouncer, have actually been recorded in English <b>first</b> <b>and</b> <b>then</b> adapted to Japanese. The Last Remnant also adopted this approach, featuring motion-capture and dialogue synched to English rather than Japanese actors. This was done due to the company's wish to create a title for the international market.|$|E
