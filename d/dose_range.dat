25|$|Rivaroxaban has {{predictable}} pharmacokinetics {{across a}} wide spectrum of patients (age, gender, weight, race) and has a flat dose response across an eightfold <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> (5–40mg).|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{concentrations}} achieved, progesterone by intramuscular injection at the usual clinical <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> is able to suppress gonadotropin secretion from the pituitary gland, demonstrating antigonadotropic efficacy (and therefore suppression of gonadal sex steroid production).|$|E
25|$|Dydrogesterone has {{predictable}} pharmacokinetics. The single-dose kinetics are linear in {{the oral}} <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> of 2.5–10mg. The pharmacokinetics do not change during repeated administration of up to 20mg dydrogesterone once daily. Steady state is attained after 3days of treatment.|$|E

25|$|Citalopram is {{considered}} safe and well tolerated in the therapeutic <b>dose</b> <b>range.</b> Distinct {{from some other}} agents in its class, it exhibits linear pharmacokinetics and minimal drug interaction potential, making it a better choice for the elderly or comorbid patients.|$|E
25|$|A 10 nm wide, 10 nm long assist feature region, at {{a target}} non-printing dose of 15 mJ/cm2, with 10% absorption, {{is defined by}} just over 100 photons, {{which leads to a}} 6s noise of 59%, {{corresponding}} to a stochastic <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> of 6 to 24 mJ/cm2, which could affect the printability.|$|E
25|$|The usual <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> for {{induction}} of anesthesia using thiopental is from 3 to 6mg/kg; however, {{there are}} many factors that can alter this. Premedication with sedatives such as benzodiazepines or clonidine will reduce requirements, as do specific disease states and other patient factors. Among patient factors are: age, sex, and lean body mass. Specific disease conditions that can alter the dose requirements of thiopentone {{and for that matter}} any other intravenous anaesthetic are: hypovolemia, burns, azotemia, hepatic failure, hypoproteinemia, etc.|$|E
50|$|There {{have been}} several {{clinical}} studies to examine the pharmacokinetics of deramciclane, which can readily cross the blood-brain barrier. Overall, studies show that deramciclane follows linear pharmacokinetics in humans with oral daily <b>doses</b> <b>ranging</b> from 3-150 mg and twice daily <b>doses</b> <b>ranging</b> from 10-60 mg. Additionally, no differences {{have been found in}} adsorption, distribution, metabolism, or elimination when an oral dose is administered in tablet or capsule form.|$|R
50|$|Beraprost is {{administered}} orally as a pill available in strength of 20 mcg. <b>Dose</b> <b>ranges</b> from 60 to 180 mcg in divided doses after meals.|$|R
50|$|Reported {{modalities}} of intake include oral consumption, insufflation, smoking, rectal and intravenous use. It {{is supposedly}} active at 3-5 mg, with typical <b>doses</b> <b>ranging</b> between 5-20 mg.|$|R
25|$|For {{the last}} 100 years {{there has been}} not a case of {{overdose}} on probiotics, which substantiates L. bulgaricus GLB44 as an extremely safe product, without limitations of the quantity consumed. It is also recommendable for the elderly as it helps reduce infections such as the common cold, as well as for young children (i.e. when they suffer from acute diarrhea). , published by Harvard Medical School, recommends a GLB44 <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> of between 1 and 10 billion colony forming units (CFU) per day, the amount contained in a capsule or two several days a week.|$|E
25|$|Diazepam was {{detected}} in 26% {{of cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs in Sweden, and its active metabolite nordazepam {{was detected}} in 28% of cases. Other benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone also were found in high numbers. Many drivers had blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic <b>dose</b> <b>range,</b> suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines and zolpidem and zopiclone. In Northern Ireland in cases where drugs were detected in samples from impaired drivers who were not impaired by alcohol, benzodiazepines were found in 87% of cases. Diazepam was the most commonly detected benzodiazepine.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone {{and other}} {{sedative}} hypnotic drugs are detected frequently {{in cases of}} people suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of drugs. Other drugs, including the benzodiazepines and zolpidem, are also found in high numbers of suspected drugged drivers. Many drivers have blood levels far exceeding the therapeutic <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> and often in combination with other alcohol, illegal, or prescription drugs of abuse, suggesting a high degree of abuse potential for benzodiazepines, zolpidem, and zopiclone. Zopiclone, which at prescribed doses causes moderate impairment the next day, has been estimated to increase the risk of vehicle accidents by 50%, causing an increase of 503 excess accidents per 100,000 persons. Zaleplon or other nonimpairing sleep aids were recommended be used instead of zopiclone to reduce traffic accidents. Zopiclone as with other hypnotic drugs is sometimes abused to carry out criminal acts such as sexual assaults.|$|E
30|$|There were no {{significant}} differences between low-dose CT screening and follow-up standard diagnostic CT for lung cancer screening in all 11 criteria. The concordance rate for the diagnoses was approximately 80 % (p[*]<[*] 0.001) for all categories. Agreement of the evaluation of all categories in the final diagnosis exceeded 94 % (p[*]<[*] 0.001). Five physicians detecting and characterizing the pulmonary nodules did not recognized the difference between low-dose CT screening and follow-up standard diagnostic CT. With low-dose CT, the effective <b>dose</b> <b>ranged</b> between 1.3 and 3.4  mSv, whereas in the follow-up diagnostic CT, the effective <b>dose</b> <b>ranged</b> between 8.5 and 14.0  mSv.|$|R
40|$|The total dose {{effects of}} 50 MeV lithium (Li 3 +) ions on 200 GHz (8 HP) silicon-germanium {{heterojunction}} bipolar transistors (SiGe HBTs) are studied in total <b>doses</b> <b>ranging</b> from 300 krad to 10 Mrad. The different electrical characteristics, {{such as the}} Gummel characteristics, dc current gain (h(FE)), neutral base recombination, avalanche multiplication of carriers (M - 1) and output characteristics (I-C-V-CE), were studied before and after Li 3 + ion irradiation. The results of 50 MeV Li 3 + ion irradiation on SiGe HBTs are compared with Co- 60 gamma irradiation results in the same <b>dose</b> <b>ranges...</b>|$|R

25|$|The {{effect sizes}} of very-low-dose doxepin in the {{treatment}} of insomnia range from small to medium. These include subjective and objective measures of sleep maintenance, sleep duration, and sleep efficiency. Conversely, very-low-dose doxepin shows relatively weak effects on sleep initiation and does not significantly separate from placebo on this measure. This is in contrast to benzodiazepines and nonbenzodiazepine (Z-drug) hypnotics, which are additionally effective in improving sleep onset latency. However, it is also in contrast to higher doses of doxepin (50 to 300mg/day), which have been found to significantly reduce latency to sleep onset. A positive dose–response relationship on sleep measures was observed for doses of doxepin between 1 and 6mg in clinical studies, whereas the incidence of adverse effects remained constant across this <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> in both young and older adults. However, the incidence of adverse effects appeared to increase with longer treatment duration. A dose of doxepin as low as 1mg/day was found to significantly improve most of the assessed sleep measures, but unlike the 3 and 6mg/day doses, was not able to improve wake time during sleep. This, along with greater effect sizes with the higher doses, was likely the basis for the approval of the 3 and 6mg doses of doxepin for insomnia and not the 1mg dose.|$|E
2500|$|Fluoxetine {{has been}} {{detected}} in aquatic ecosystems, especially in North America. There {{is a growing}} body of research addressing the effects of fluoxetine (among other SSRIs) exposure on non-target aquatic species. [...] As of 2003 there was little research on environmental effects; the research showed little effects on aquatic plants at relevant exposure levels; toxicological studies had been done on the model fish, Medaka and found little effect on adult behavior or physiology, but developmental abnormalities were observed more frequently in spawn of fish that had been exposed to relevant doses. [...] Studies had also been conducted on mesocosms that included sunfish, that were exposed to three dose ranges of the combination of fluoxetine, ibuprofen, and ciprofloxacin, with the highest <b>dose</b> <b>range</b> set well beyond environmental exposures; [...] almost all the fish died at the doses in the highest ranges and half the fish died in the middle dose ranges, while almost none died in the low range and in the controls. [...] The reason for this was studied but the investigators were not able to identify the cause. [...] Subsequent studies showed that fluoxetine may be an endocrine disruptor in some fish species.|$|E
50|$|The {{absolute}} bioavailability of lobeglitazone is about 95% in rat. In human, the mean steady state clearance (CLss/F) was 1.13 L/h across in 1 to 4 mg <b>dose</b> <b>range.</b> In the <b>dose</b> <b>range,</b> the mean half-life was 10.3 h.
