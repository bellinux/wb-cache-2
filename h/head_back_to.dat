5|$|As Bryan spoke {{his final}} sentence, recalling the Crucifixion of Jesus, {{he placed his}} hands to his temples, fingers {{extended}}; with the final words, he extended his arms to his sides straight out to his body and held that pose for about five seconds as if offering himself as sacrifice for the cause, as the audience watched in dead silence. He then lowered them, descended from the podium, and began to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his seat as the stillness held.|$|E

5|$|Rundgren {{had become}} {{confident}} enough at other instruments beyond his standard guitar and keyboards {{that he had}} tackled in earlier releases, and this, coupled with a general dissatisfaction with other studio musicians, led him to temporarily relocate to Los Angeles {{in an attempt to}} record an entire album single-handedly. After he had created significantly more material than would fit on a standard LP, an earthquake struck LA. He decided to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York for some live sessions, with the help of Moogy Klingman, to lighten the mood. The final sessions were in Bearsville, where the remainder of the recording and mixing took place, and this created enough material for a double album.|$|E

Meanwhile, on the alien spacecraft, the two aliens converse with their leader who shows them footage of Billy using the cannon, prompting the aliens to turn their ship around to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Earth.

5|$|Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) celebrates his winning of the Vice President {{position}} on a golf outing with Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), Robert California (James Spader), and Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). After playing, Robert tells Jim that he dislikes the business plan for the Sabre store, citing the poor quality of the products; he only approved it because Jo Bennett wanted it, but he plans to sandbag it at a high-level meeting, and Jim is stunned when Robert strongly hints {{he is going to}} fire Dwight over it. Jim makes several attempts to stop Dwight from attending the meeting with Robert, but Dwight is heedless and continually insults Jim, who finally decides to leave Dwight to his fate. However, a guilt-inducing phone call to Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) makes Jim decide he has to keep parsing Dwight's insults until he directly tells him {{that he is going to}} lose his job. Dwight ignores the news, thinking Jim is jealous of him, so Jim resorts to wrestling with Dwight outside the conference room. In the meantime, Nellie has Todd Packer (David Koechner) stand in as VP in Dwight's absence. When Dwight makes it into the conference room, he hears Robert planning to fire the VP, so he sneaks out of the conference room and lets Packer take the fall in front of those present. Dwight then silently extends a hand to Jim, and they <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Scranton with Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), who has reverted to his old grumpy self over the thought of leaving Florida.|$|E

5|$|However, the {{possible}} {{defeat of the}} Jurchens threatened {{the power of the}} new emperor of the Southern Song, Gaozong and his premier Qin Hui. The reason for this was that Qinzong, the last emperor of the Northern Song was living in Jin-imposed exile in Manchuria and had a good chance of being recalled to the throne should the Jin dynasty be destroyed. Although Yue Fei had penetrated into enemy territory as far as Luoyang, he was ordered to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the capital and halt his campaign. Emperor Gaozong signed the Treaty of Shaoxing in 1141 that fixed the borders at the Huai River, as well as conceded territory regained through the efforts of Yue Fei, while Yue was killed during imprisonment. As part of the treaty, the Song were also forced to pay tribute to the Jin, much as it had to the Liao. With the treaty of Shaoxing, hostilities ceased between the Jin and Song dynasties for the next two decades. In the meantime, Emperor Gaozong negotiated with the Jin over his mother's ransom while he commissioned a symbolic art project about her, the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute, originally based upon the life of Cai Wenji (b. 177). Gaozong's mother was eventually released and brought south, but Qinzong was never freed from his confinement in the north.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Aldermach Maggotbone {{is ready}} to hand over his title {{as the leader of}} Hell to his daughter, Callie. However, Callie does not want to take over his job. A {{competition}} is held to choose which one will overtake the title and Callie tries to lose every challenge, but Twayne makes sure that she wins each time. At the studio where Dishonorable Discharge was filmed, Grimes forces some bystanders to act in his ending of the series, which reveals the memory Grimes had repressed: While trying to take down Aldermach when he became the new leader of Hell, Grimes accidentally killed a disguised Jimmy. In present time, Mark, Grimes and Randall <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York to sabotage the new ceremony. At the ceremony, Aldermach unexpectedly chooses to give the Slitherix (a big snake one has to swallow to become the leader of Hell) to his secretary, Cathy, to spare Callie from getting the job. Just as Cathy is about to receive the snake, Grimes crashes the car into the church and shoots her. It is then revealed that she is really Grimes' old partner Jimmy, who had worked undercover in Hell for 35 years. Embarrassed, Grimes begins to repress his memories again, which Mark believes is for the best. The episode ends with an angel waking up, suggesting that the episode was her dream.|$|E

Andy and Erin decide to bail, but Jessica returns from her morning run. After staying a while, Andy asks Jessica into the kitchen where she deduces that he is breaking up with her. Erin is surprised however when Jessica said that Andy told her he did not think Erin was relationship material.

In the car, Andy says he made those comments about Erin because he was with Jessica before Erin falls asleep. Andy decides to <b>head</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the cabin to tell Jessica and her party that he broke up with her because he wanted to be with Erin and that she is relationship material, while Erin overhears. Jessica and her party chase Andy and Erin back to the car. Erin passionately kisses Andy inside the car while the party throws cake at them, prompting a quick getaway.|$|E
