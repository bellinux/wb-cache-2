Systems of pork {{production}} changed from a forest-based to pasture-based to dirt lots and finally into specially-designed buildings. The world pork industry is variable and complex not just in production methods but in economics and cultural value. A systematic analysis of pork industry sustainability was performed. Sustainable production methods are considered at three levels using three examples in this paper: production system, penning system and for a production practice. A sustainability matrix was provided for each example. In a comparison of indoor vs. outdoor systems, the food safety/zoonoses concerns make current outdoor systems unsustainable. The choice of keeping pregnant sows in group pens or individual crates is complex in that the outcome of a sustainability assessment leads to the conclusion that <b>group</b> <b>penning</b> is more sustainable in the EU and certain USA states, but the individual crate is currently more sustainable in other USA states, Asia and Latin America. A comparison of conventional physical castration with immunological castration shows that the less-common immunological castration method is more sustainable (for a number of reasons). This paper provides a method to assess the sustainability of production systems and practices that take into account the best available science, human perception and culture, animal welfare, the environment, food safety, worker health and safety, and economics (including the cost of production and solving world hunger).

Siberian husky sled dogs from a commercial sled-dog kennel (n= 9), were exposed to four different housing conditions and filmed to record behaviours for analysis. Filming took place at the sled dog kennel. The conditions consisted of six-months with no-exercise/tethered (Condition A), exercise (daily running) /tethered (Condition B), four weeks no-exercise/tethered (Condition C) and no exercise/un-tethered in <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> with 3 dogs per pen (Condition D). The dogs were returned to baseline (Condition A) after three months in <b>group</b> <b>pen</b> housing to control for order effects. Subjects were then filmed after a two-week habituation period. The tethered housing conditions (A,B and C) produced evidence of more repetitive behaviours and fewer social behaviours than the un-tethered housing condition. Although un-tethering subsequently reduced rebound and repetitive behaviours, the variable of tethering without exercise (conditions A and C) revealed the greatest difference in behaviour. Long term tethering with no exercise produced agonistic behaviours indicative of frustrative non-reward heightened by the intermittent delivery of the reward of exercise. Increased aggression vigorously directed at neighbouring dogs and an overall increase in vigilance was the direct consequence of the frustration of non- reward. Un-tethering significantly reduced interdog aggression (p=. 05), but the dogs remained vigilant. Therefore, long-term tethering without exercise or with the intermittent reward of exercise produces an increase in frustrative maladaptive behaviours such as aggression and increased vigilance...|$|R

40|$|The {{traditional}} housing of {{veal calves}} in individual crates without roughage has received prolonged and serious criticism, since it denies the animals various social activities, {{freedom of movement}} and the possibility to consume roughage and to ruminate. In order to develop an economically acceptable alternative to this housing system, which would provide a significant improvement in calf welfare, the housing of calves in groups of five was evaluated with regards to husbandry, health and ethological aspects. The present study focussed mainly on the behaviour of the calves in individual crates and <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> (chapter IV) {{and it was only}} casually concerned with the production and health of the animals (chapter III). A major problem in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> was the occurrence of preputial sucking and urine drinking, which had a negative influence on production, health and behaviour. The development of these activities was described (chapter V) and several experiments concerning their prevention were presented (chapter VI). The influence on lying behaviour of the tethering of the calves during the first 6 - 8 weeks after arrival - as a preventive measure against preputial sucking and urine drinking - was studied in chapter VII. Finally, restrictions to particular lying postures in the crates were investigated with respect to their effect on sleep (chapter VIII). In five consecutive experiments, a total of 94 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 65 x 0, 65 m) and provided with 100 g straw/calf/day. whereas 99 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 20 x 3, 83 m) on concrete slatted floors with straw bedding and an ad libitum supply of straw in baskets. The group housed calves were not tethered during the first weeks after arrival. In four other experiments, a total of 47 calves were housed in individual crates (1, 70 x 0, 70 m) and given 200 g straw cobs/calf/day from week 7 or 9 onwards, whereas 139 calves were kept in groups of five in pens (2, 40 x 3, 05 m) on wooden (and in some pens partly concrete) slatted floors. 1 kg straw cobs was supplied daily from week 7 or 9 onwards in one trough per <b>group</b> <b>pen.</b> During the first 6 weeks after arrival, the calves were tethered to the feeding gate, separated individually by partitions. All calves were male and predominantly black and white (FH x HF). In three out of the nine experiments, male red and white (MRY) calves were used. The influence of this breed difference was not discussed. The calves were fed a milk replacer in open buckets twice daily at approximately 8. 00 and 16. 00 h. In chapter III, limited data on production, health and labour requirements of the calves in these housing systems are reported, which provide a first impression on how individual crates and <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> compare. Growth rate (about 1200 g /day) and feed conversion (about 1, 5) of the calves slaughtered at a normal weight in <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> with and without straw bedding {{on the one hand and}} individual crates on the other were comparable and quite favourable. Slaughter quality, which was satisfactory in general, was also similar in these different housing systems. Haemoglobin levels at slaughter were fairly high (8 - 110 g/ 100 ml), but meat colour was still acceptable. A relatively large number of group housed calves, however, died or had to be culled or eliminated. The total of these losses amounted to 10, 1 % in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> with straw bedding, against 4, 3 % in the corresponding crates; in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> with slatted floors the total losses were 9, 4 % against 2, 2 % in the crates. These high losses in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> mainly occurred because in this housing system it was difficult to treat diseased calves individually (for example by supplying a medicinated milk replacer) since they were often pushed away by penmates. When disregarding these losses, the health status of the calves, as measured by the frequency and duration of the different medical treatments imposed,seemed no worse in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> than in the individual crates. In the <b>group</b> <b>pens,</b> the provision of 23, 3 kg strawlcalf for feeding and 106, 3 kg straw/ calf for bedding took 138, 7 min/calf in total during the entire fattening period, against 32, 6 min/calf for supplying 7, 1 kg straw/calf in the individual crates. In the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> with bare slatted floors and the corresponding crates, the total amount of straw cobs provided from week 9 onwards (13 - 14 kg/calf) and the time required to do this (15 - 17 min/calf) were about equal. In the first series of experiments, when the calves were tethered for the first 6 weeks after arrival, preputial sucking did not occur. The muzzling of preputial suckers was not satisfactory, since it obstructed smelling, licking and the intake of straw and moreover, it did not stop the ingestion of urine. Abomasal lesions (erosions, ulcers, scars), which were mainly located in the pyloric region, were observed in calves housed in individual crates and <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> alike. In only 14 - 37 % of the animals, the abomasums were not affected by lesions. It was concluded that group housing with or without straw bedding is not incompatible with fast growth, favourable feed conversion and adequate slaughter quality. The high losses in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> may perhaps be reduced by restraining the calves at feeding with a self- yoking feeding gate, which facilitates not only the treatment of illnesses but also their detection. The latter seems particularly valuable on practical farms, when health inspection is not as intensive as in the present study. The supply and removal of straw as a bedding is extremely labour intensive and therefore wooden slatted floors without straw are preferred in further research. The study of the causation and prevention of preputial sucking and urine drinking has a high priority, since preventive tethering restricts freedom of movement, social contact and exploratory behaviour. In chapter IV, it was investigated to what extent calves in individual crates were restricted in their behaviour in comparison to calves in <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> and how they dealt with their situation. For this purpose, the behaviour of the same calves whose production characteristics were described in the previous chapter was registered. Observations were carried out on all individual calves in both housing systems over one period of 23 hours (24 hours with exception of feeding periods) in weeks 8, 12, 16 and 20 after arrival by means of instantaneous sampling in 10 minute intervals. Subsequently, an analysis of variance was executed to calculate the average frequency and trend for each behaviour and both housing systems were compared on the basis of these parameters. The percentages quoted are close approximations of average values over the second series of four experiments (with <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> on slatted floors without straw bedding and the corresponding crates). The calves in the crates spent more time lying than those in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> (74 against 68 %). This is probably above all the result of a greater variety of stimuli in the <b>group</b> <b>pens,</b> but occasional mounting and treading of penmates may also have contributed to this difference. Lying on the side or on the brisket with both hindlegs stretched in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> amounted to 2 and 8 % of total lying time respectively. Lying was severely restricted by the sidewalls of the crates and consequently, these postures only rarely occurred in the crates at the end of the fattening period. It is argued that these restrictions may interfere with the relaxation of the body. Moreover, these limitations seemed to affect behavioural thermoregulation; the crated calves regulated heat loss by stretching their forelegs forwards during lying (27 % of total lying) or by bending them under the body, whereas the group housed calves increased or decreased body. contact with the floor often by stretching and bending their hindlegs instead of their forelegs (hindlegs stretched: 10 % of total lying; forelegs stretched: 15, 5 % of total lying). Lying with the head turned backwards, which is the usual posture for supporting the head (in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> 20 - 25 % of total lying) became increasingly restricted in the individual crates towards the end of the fattening period. In the crates, the duration of this lying posture as a proportion of total lying decreased from 25 % in week 8 to 5 % in week 20. Although the head was supported forwards on the floor more often (10 % instead of 5 % of total lying) or against the partitions (1 - 2 % of total lying), the duration of lying with the head supported was clearly reduced in the crates in comparison to the group pens: 16 % and 30 % respectively. The latter percentage includes lying with the head on penmates in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> (5 % of total lying). Since supporting the head is necessary for the relaxation of the neck muscles during certain states of sleep, the restriction of these tying postures in the crates may interfere with sleep as a physiological process. Furthermore, the licking of the belly, back, thighs or hindlegs (1, 7 % in the crates and 3, 2 % in the <b>group</b> <b>pens)</b> and the scratching of the head, neck or shoulders (0, 05 against 0, 16 %) were also hindered by the sidewalls of the crate, whereas rubbing (0, 6 - 0, 7 %) was not impaired. On the other hand, the licking of the forelegs (1, 0 against 0, 7 %) and the muzzle (1, 9 against 1, 1 %), which are easily accessible, was more frequently performed by the crated calves than by the group housed ones. The increase of the latter activities in the individual crates may be related to conflict situations. Self stretching was reduced in the crates as compared to the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> (0, 14 against 0, 25 %). In the individual crates, physical interactions between neighbouring calves were usually limited to licking and sucking at feeding times when the front was opened, whereas in the <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> mutual licking occurred regularly throughout the day (2, 5 %) and head butting and mounting (together 1, 0 %)|$|R

An experiment was conducted in which the effect of hiding places, straw and territory on aggression in intermittent group-housed rabbit does was studied. The group-housing system consisted of four adjacent enriched individual cages that had been transformed into one <b>group</b> <b>pen</b> for four does by taking out three side walls. <b>Group</b> <b>pens</b> were 1. 0 m × 1. 5 m × 0. 6 m (length × width × height). Does were housed individually until 18 days of lactation. As of day 18 of lactation, four multiparous hybrid does (Hycole) with their kits were housed in a group until 35 days of lactation. All combinations of the following factors were randomly assigned: hiding places (platform and PVC pipe), straw and territory (i. e. familiarity with the cage before grouping) (8 treatments). Sixteen pens were used during 5 successive lactations of 35 days (n = 10 /treatment). Behavioural observations were performed at two afternoons at the start {{and end of the}} group-housing period of each lactation and skin injuries were registered on 4, 7, 10, 14 and 17 days after being group-housed. Does were resting 70 % of the observed time. Does with territory showed significantly more comfort behaviour than does without territory (13 % vs. 9 % of the observed time, respectively; P < 0. 05). At start does showed less comfort behaviour and more locomotion than {{at the end of the}} group-housing period (7 % vs. 15 % and 2 % vs. 1 % of the observed time, respectively; P < 0. 05). Occupation with straw, stereotyped behaviour and fights were only observed in 4 %, 3 % and 0. 3 % of the does, respectively. There were no differences in skin injuries between treatments. Overall 52 % of the does had injuries. The percentage of does that had severe injuries ranged between 13 % and 39 %. Treatments with hiding places had the lowest numerical percentage of severe injuries and there was a tendency (P < 0. 1) for less culled does in this treatment. In conclusion, does do not defend a territory within a <b>group</b> <b>pen.</b> Hiding places can help to reduce severe skin injuries. However, the high amount of does with skin injuries merits further study...|$|R

We studied the effect of environmental enrichment and territory on aggression in group-housed rabbit does. The group housing system consisted of four adjacent individual cages that were transformed into one group-housing system for four multiparous lactating hybrid does by taking away three side walls at d 18 of lactation. Until d 18 of lactation, does were housed individually in the cages of the <b>group</b> <b>pen</b> (territory (T)) or in other individual cages (no territory (NT)). Does were housed in groups until weaning of the kits at 35 d of lactation. Within T and NT the following enrichments were provided (split-plot design) : hiding places (HP), straw (S), hiding places and straw (HP+S) or no enrichment (NE)). Sixteen <b>group</b> <b>pens</b> were used for five subsequent rounds (n= 10 /treatment). Behavioural observations were performed and skin injuries and technical performance were registered. Treatments {{did not differ in}} frequency of agonistic interactions at 1 and 3 days after placement in the groups (average number of agonistic interactions for all treatments, day 1 148 ± 24; day 3 51 ± 27). Overall 52. 2 % of the animals had injuries (range 13 - 39 %). Treatments with hiding places did have the lowest percentages of wounds and injuries numerically (% does with wounds: HP 13 %; HP+S 27 %; NE 31 %; S 39 %; average T 24 %, NT 31 %) but no significant treatment effects were found. There was a tendency for less does culled in HP and HP+S (0. 25 and 0. 3) compared with NE (0. 8) and S (0. 65) (...|$|R
