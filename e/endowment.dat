5|$|As {{a public}} university, McGill {{is not as}} {{dependent}} on its <b>endowment</b> for operating revenue as some of its international peers. The McGill <b>endowment</b> only provides approximately 10 per cent of the school's annual operating revenues. Nonetheless, McGill's <b>endowment</b> rests within the top 10 percent of all North American post-secondary institutions' endowments. While McGill's conservative investment policy has protected it from the more substantial losses experienced at many other universities during the market crisis of 2008–2009, it still faced a 20% <b>endowment</b> decline from approximately $920 million to $740 million. Currently valued at $39,323 per student, the university's <b>endowment</b> is the second largest among Canadian universities on a per-student basis.|$|E

Inconsistent with better monitoring, program expenditures toward the charitable good are lower for firms with excess <b>endowments,</b> and CEO pay and total officer and director pay are greater for firms with excess <b>endowments.</b> Overall, we find that excess <b>endowments</b> are associated with greater agency problems...|$|R

5|$|These {{additional}} {{revenues were}} expected, {{when combined with}} spending cuts including a reduction of $200 million in higher education spending, to meet the state's balanced-budget requirement. A clause was also inserted into the budget cutting state aid for schools that hold over $1 billion in endowments. The only school in New Jersey that fell into this category was Princeton University, which had an <b>endowment</b> with assets over $11 billion in 2006. The university that had the largest <b>endowment</b> next to Princeton {{at the time was}} Drew University which had a $225 million <b>endowment</b> fund.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between vertical intra-industry trade (VIIT) and differences in <b>endowments.</b> We present evidence that the share of VIIT between the European Union (UE) and its 51 major trading partners tends to increase for small differences in <b>endowments</b> and to decrease for wider differences in <b>endowments.</b> This suggests that the relation between VIIT and <b>endowments</b> does not follow the pattern of either horizontal IIT (HIIT) or of the net trade flows (as assumed by most former empirical studies about VIIT). This paper suggests a more complex relationship between VIIT and <b>endowments,</b> arguing that this is {{in accordance with the}} theoretical models. To study this we introduce new variables that relate VIIT to horizontal IIT and VIIT to net trade flows. The results suggest that the share of VIIT in total IIT increases with differences in <b>endowments,</b> and that net trade tends to increase more than VIIT when differences in <b>endowments</b> become wider. This evidence contributes to explain the pattern of VIIT. The results also suggest that VIIT assumes {{a leading role in the}} exchanges of factor services between countries with moderate differences in factor <b>endowments</b> while net trade dominates the net exchanges of factor services between countries with wider differences in factor <b>endowments.</b> ...|$|R
