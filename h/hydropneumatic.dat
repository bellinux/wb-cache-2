5|$|The bore {{evacuator}} and the gun's thermal sleeve, {{designed to}} regulate {{the temperature of the}} barrel, are made of glass-reinforced plastic, while the barrel has a chrome lining to increase barrel life. Originally the gun had an EFC barrel life of ~1,500 rounds, but with recent advances in propellant technology the average life has increased even further. The gun's recoil mechanism is composed of two hydraulic retarders and a <b>hydropneumatic</b> assembly.|$|E
5|$|The car was {{initially}} designed in 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. The car was fitted with controversial <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|The fan car and <b>hydropneumatic</b> {{suspension}} exploited loopholes in {{the sporting}} regulations. In the early 1980s, Brabham {{was accused of}} going further and breaking the regulations. During 1981, Piquet's first championship year, rumours circulated of illegal underweight Brabham chassis. Driver Jacques Laffite was among those {{to claim that the}} cars were fitted with heavily ballasted bodywork before being weighed at scrutineering. The accusation was denied by Brabham's management. No formal protest was made against the team and no action was taken against them by the sporting authorities.|$|E

5000|$|Suspension and {{springing}} {{technology is}} not generally well understood by consumers, {{leading to a}} public perception that <b>hydropneumatics</b> are merely [...] "good for comfort". They also have advantages related to handling and control efficiency, solving {{a number of problems}} inherent in steel springs that suspension designers have previously struggled to eliminate.|$|R
40|$|The people’s {{life and}} {{activity}} {{in nature and}} society depends primary by air, water, light, climate, ground and by using the aeolian, hydraulic, mechanic and electrical energies, generated by the dynamics of these environments. The dynamics of these phenomena from the nature is linear and majority nonlinear, probabilistic – inducing a mathematical modeling – for the optimal control, with the equations with a big complexity. In the paper the author presents new mathematical models and methods in the optimization of these phenomena with technical applications: the optimization of the hydraulic, aeolian turbine’s blades or for the eliminating air pollutants and residual water purification; the actions <b>hydropneumatics</b> (robotics) to balance the ship in roll stability, optimizing the sails (wind powered) for extreme durability or propelling force, optimizing aircraft profiles for the drag or the lift forces, directing navigation, parachute brake, the wall, etc. The scientific results are accompanied by numerical calculations, integrating in the specialized literature from our country and foreign...|$|R
5|$|The team {{used the}} BT49 over four seasons. In the 1980 season Piquet scored three wins {{and the team}} took third in the Constructors' Championship with Piquet second in the Drivers' Championship. This season saw the {{introduction}} of the blue and white livery that the cars would wear through several changes of sponsor, until the team's demise in 1992. With a better understanding of ground effect, the team further developed the BT49C for the 1981 season, incorporating a <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension system to avoid ride height limitations intended to reduce downforce. Piquet, who had developed a close working relationship with Murray, took the drivers' title with three wins, albeit amid accusations of cheating. The team finished second in the Constructors' Championship, behind the Williams team.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydropneumatic</b> active suspension, {{which allows}} it to adjust its stance and absorbs recoil when firing.|$|E
25|$|The barrel, {{much longer}} than that of older designs, was fitted with an {{interrupted}} screw breechblock with recoil devices consisting of hydraulic recoil buffer and <b>hydropneumatic</b> recuperator. The recoil length was variable. Gun shield provided the crew with limited protection from bullets and shell fragments.|$|E
50|$|Since Citroën was undercapitalised, its {{vehicles}} had {{the tendency}} to be underdeveloped at launch, with limited distribution and service networks outside France, consequently the early DS models experienced teething issues with the novel suspension but, eventually, the <b>hydropneumatics</b> were sorted out and became reliable.Licensing such a technological leap forward was pursued to a limited extent: in 1965 the Rolls-Royce Silver Shadow did include this suspension, while the 1963 Mercedes-Benz 600 and Mercedes-Benz 300SEL 6.3 tried to replicate its advantages with a costly, complex and expensive to maintain, air suspension, that avoided the Citroën patented technology. By 1975, the Mercedes-Benz 450SEL 6.9 could finally be produced with this proven system and Mercedes-Benz continues to offer variations on this technology today.During Citroën's 1968-1975 venture with Maserati, the Citroën high-pressure hydraulic system was used on several Maserati models : for power clutch operation (Bora); power pedal adjustment (Bora); pop-up headlights (Bora, Merak); brakes (Bora, Merak, Khamsin); steering (Khamsin) and the entire Quattroporte II prototype, which was a four-door Citroën SM under the skin.|$|R
25|$|The {{barrel of}} the M-30 was of {{built-up}} construction and consisted of a liner, jacket and breech. The breechblock was of interrupted screw type, with forced cartridge case extraction. The gun was equipped with a hydraulic recoil buffer and <b>hydropneumatic</b> recuperator. A panoramic sight was used for both indirect and direct fire.|$|E
25|$|For {{so light}} a weapon, it {{embodied}} a remarkable number of modern construction features. It had a Schneider type, <b>hydropneumatic</b> independent recoil system, a Krupp type horizontal sliding-wedge breechblock, split trails with spade plates for stabilizers, pintle traverse, and an equalizing arrangement which gave it three-point suspension. Since it was trunnioned {{at the center}} of balance, it did not require equilibrators. It could be fired with trails closed or open.|$|E
25|$|The barrel {{was adapted}} from the 3 inch Gun T9; it had rifling with a uniform right hand twist, with 28 grooves and one turn in 25 inches. Barrel length was 13.16 feet. It was {{combined}} with breech, recoil system and carriage from the 105 mm Howitzer M2. The breech was of horizontal sliding type, manual; the recoil system <b>hydropneumatic.</b> The carriage was of split trail type, equipped with a single equilibrator spring beneath the breech and wheels with pneumatic tires.|$|E
25|$|The M1 {{was very}} similar in {{construction}} and appearance to the 155mm Howitzer M1. The only significant difference was its tube of 4.5 inch (114mm) caliber. The tube had uniform right hand twist, with one turn in 32 calibers. The unbalanced weight of the barrel was supported by two equilibrator springs. The breach was of interrupted screw type; the recoil system <b>hydropneumatic,</b> variable length. The carriage was of split trail type, unsprung and had wheels with pneumatic tires. In firing position, the weapon {{was supported by a}} retractable pedestal. The gun was equipped with M12 panoramic sight.|$|E
25|$|Although {{occasionally}} {{mentioned as}} {{a copy of the}} French Schneider et Cie Canon de 75 Mle 1933, this connection is dubious. The Type 95 essentially utilized the Model 38 (improved) weapon with sliding-wedge type breechblock and <b>hydropneumatic</b> recoil mechanism on the split trail carriage used on the Type 90. This hybrid design addressed the issue of the heavy weight of the Type 90, which had created problems with field commanders, as well as the need for a simpler, more rugged design that could be transported by a team of six horses. As with the Type 90, the Type 95 was built in two versions: one with wooden wheels suitable for animal draft, and another with solid rubber tires and a stronger suspension for towing by motor vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Arjun Mark II has a {{total of}} 93 upgrades, {{including}} 13 major improvements. The major upgrades are missile-firing capability against long-range targets, panoramic sight with night vision to engage targets effectively at night, containerisation of the ammunition, enhanced main weapon penetration; additional ammunition types, explosive reactive armour, an advanced air-defence gun to engage helicopters; a mine plough, an advanced land navigation system and a warning system which can fire smoke grenades to confuse laser guidance. Other upgrades are an enhanced Auxiliary power unit providing 8.5 KW (from 4.5 KW) and an improved gun barrel, changes in the commander's panoramic sight with eye safe LRF, night vision capability including for driver, digital control harness, new final drive, track and sprocket. The Arjun Mk.2 has an advanced <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension system which provides very good comfort to the crew, This tank is also fitted with auxiliary power unit which powers all systems when the main engine is turned off and It can be also fitted with a mine plough.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of its operation, the BMD-1 had no analogues abroad. Its main {{armament}} was a 73mm smoothbore gun with a coaxial 7.62mm PKT machine gun. It also had a launcher rail for the 9M14 Malyutka. Additional armaments include two bow-mounted 7.62mm PKT machine guns in the front part of the vehicle, in addition to one ball joint firing port on either side and cover of the rear hatch to fire from individual weapons. The vehicle also featured a <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension system capable of changing its ground clearance. A low weight of 7.5 t allowed it to be light enough to parachute from any types of military-transport aircraft. This airborne infantry fighting vehicle (IFV) also possessed one of the highest power-to-weight ratios at 32hp/tonne. The BMD-1 was the first domestically produced vehicle equipped with aluminum armor to ensure its light weight. The engineering incorporated in the BMD-1 allowed it {{to be used as a}} base vehicle for multiple variants including the BMD-1K and the BTR-D.|$|E
25|$|The engine {{compartment}} {{is located in}} the rear of the vehicle and consists of: a 2V-06-02 water-cooled diesel engine developing 450hp, a main clutch, a gearbox, a final drives, and brakes. The suspension of the vehicle consists of five rubber-tyred road wheels on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear, an idler at the front, and four track-return rollers. The BMD-3 is fitted with a new hydromechanical transmission with hydrostatic steering mechanism. This adjustable suspension gives a ground clearance between 130 and 530mm with 450mm being the default. This <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension allows the BMD-3 to decrease its height to be able to board transport aircraft like the Il-76M. The ground clearance is adjusted by the driver and it takes 10 seconds to lower or raise the suspension. The maximum road speed is 70km/h and the maximum off-road speed is 45km/h. The vehicle can achieve an operational range of up to 500km on paved roads and can climb up to 60% gradient and move on a 30% side slope. The ground pressure exerted by the BMD-3 is 0.48 kg/cm2 with standard tracks and 0.32kg/cm2 with broader tracks.|$|E
25|$|Like its predecessor, the BMD-4 {{is capable}} of {{parachuting}} from aircraft with the entire crew and passengers inside the vehicle which allows target engagement after landing to be instant. An Il-76 is able to transport two of these vehicles {{at a time in}} comparison to three BMD-1s and BMD-2s. Its engine is the 2V-06-2; the same as the BMD-3. This engine develops a total power of 450 horsepower (hp). The BMD-4 is also fully amphibious with two water jets mounted {{on each side of the}} back of the hull and can swim at speeds of up to 10km/h in a Beaufort scale of 2. With a high power-to-weight ratio, the BMD-4 features superior acceleration in comparison to other infantry fighting vehicles. The maximum speed on a highway is 70km/h and the BMD-4 can maneuver on a 60° gradient and a 35° side slope. The BMD-4 can cross 1.8 m trenches and climb 0.8 m tall obstacles. This vehicle's suspension is <b>hydropneumatic</b> and giving an adjustable ground clearing of 130–530mm with the normal road clearance being 450mm. The clearance is changed by the driver and can be changed within 10 seconds.|$|E
25|$|The 2S6 combat vehicle {{uses the}} GM-352 and later GM-352M chassis {{developed}} and {{produced by the}} Minsk Tractor Plant (MTZ) which has six road wheels with <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension on each side, a drive sprocket at the rear and three return rollers. An NBC system is also integrated into the chassis, which is protected -as the entire vehicle- from small arms fire (7,62) and shell splinters by the armor, {{as well as an}} automatic fire suppression system, an automatic gear change and diagnostic capability are available with latest Tunguska-M1 which uses the new GM-5975 chassis developed and produced by MMZ. GM-5975.25 has a cruising range of 500km and a maximum speed of 65km per hour. It can function at a relative humidity of 98 per cent at 35 degrees C, in ambient temperatures of −50 degrees C to 50 degrees C and up to an altitude of 3,000 m. It has an ability of climb up to 35 degrees, can cross slopes of 25 degrees, 2 m width ditch, 1 m depth ford. Overall, the layout is similar to the previous ZSU-23-4 with a large central 360-degree rotating turret (designated the 2A40) containing the armament, sensors and three of the crew: the commander, gunner and radar operator. The driver sits in the front left of the hull, with a gas turbine APU to his right and the multi-fuel diesel engine {{in the rear of the}} hull.|$|E
500|$|In the 1960s, Brabham was the world's largest {{manufacturer}} of open-wheel racing cars {{for sale to}} customer teams; by 1970 it had built more than 500 cars. During this period, teams using Brabham cars won championships in Formula Two and Formula Three. Brabham cars also competed in the Indianapolis 500 and in Formula 5000 racing. In the 1970s and 1980s, Brabham introduced such innovations [...] as in-race refuelling, carbon brakes, and <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension. [...] Its unique Gordon Murray designed [...] "fan car" [...] won its only race before being withdrawn.|$|E
500|$|In 1963, Germany and the United States {{had already}} {{embarked}} on a joint tank program, known as the MBT-70. The new tank carried a three-man crew, with the driver in the turret, an automatic loader for the main gun, a [...] autocannon as secondary armament, an active <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension and spaced armour on the glacis plate and the front turret. The new tank concept also had improved armament, a [...] missile-launching main gun, designed to fire the MGM-51 Shillelagh anti-tank missile. However, the German Army was interested in a tank gun which could fire conventional ammunition. Although there were attempts to modify the [...] tank gun to do so, the process proved extremely difficult, and the Germans began development of the future Rheinmetall 120mm gun instead.|$|E
500|$|Disagreement {{between the}} teams and the sport's administrators over the {{technical}} regulations for the 1981 Formula One season contributed to Goodyear's temporary withdrawal from Formula One and {{meant that the}} 1981 South African Grand Prix was run by the teams to 1980 regulations using cars with sliding skirts. Piquet finished second in a BT49B, but the race did not count towards the championship. The season proper opened with the United States Grand Prix West, at which the BT49C was introduced. To the team's surprise, {{it was the only}} car to exploit the [...] "obvious" [...] loophole in the new ground clearance regulation by lowering itself, but the BT49Cs raced with conventional suspension after the <b>hydropneumatic</b> system repeatedly jammed. The team revised the system continuously over the next three races and used it to set pole position at the Brazilian and Argentine Grands Prix and win the Argentine and San Marino races while continuing to suffer from the system not rising or lowering correctly.|$|E
500|$|Since 1995, BT49s have competed {{regularly}} in the FIA Historic Formula One Championship. The championship is open to cars that competed in Formula One in the DFV era, between 1967 and 1985, in several classes to allow for equal competition. The BT49 competes in class C, for post 1971 ground effects cars. In 1999, Motor Sport magazine tested a BT49D from the series featuring [...] from its developed DFV at 11,200rpm, but the championship has since introduced rules to restrict engines to 10,500rpm to keep costs down. While the cars' original skirts can be kept, they must be set up such that there is [...] clearance beneath the car, a rule that removes most of the advantage of ground effect. The <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension employed during 1981 is not permitted. The carbon-carbon brakes originally used in 1981 and 1982 are also banned and the cars must run with conventional brake pads and steel brakes. The cars use Avon slick tyres. Christian Glaesel won the 2005 FIA Historic Formula One Championship driving a BT49D and Joaquin Folch won the 2012 championship in a BT49C.|$|E
500|$|For the 1981 season, a BT49C {{specification}} {{was produced}} with a chassis lightened through {{increased use of}} carbon composite materials. Five of this variant were built {{and two of the}} previous year's cars converted to this specification. That year a minimum ride height of [...] was introduced and sliding skirts were banned, with the intention of limiting ground effect and slowing the cars. The BT49C regained its front wings to compensate in part for the downforce lost. More significantly, Murray devised a <b>hydropneumatic</b> suspension system for the BT49C in which soft air springs supported the car at the regulation height for checks while stationary. At speed, where the ride height could not be measured, downforce compressed the air and the car settled to a much lower height, creating more downforce. Because the skirts now had to be fixed, the suspension had to be very stiff to allow them to consistently seal around the sides of the car: {{by the end of the}} 1981 season, total suspension movement was only , half of which came from the compression of the tyres. A lightweight qualifying chassis was produced, featuring a small fuel tank and lighter reinforced carbon-carbon brake discs and pads.|$|E
