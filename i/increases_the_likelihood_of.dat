5|$|Illegal logging of {{precious}} hardwoods, such as rosewood and ebony, {{has become one}} of the greatest threats to the silky sifaka's habitat, especially since the 2009 Malagasy political crisis. Its two largest protected areas, Masoala National Park and Marojejy National Park, have been the hardest hit. The disturbance caused by selective logging <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> forest fires, helps invasive species take root, impairs habitat, and causes the loss of genetic diversity.|$|E
5|$|Some studies shows {{correlation}} of reduced hippocampus volume and {{posttraumatic stress disorder}} (PTSD). A study of Vietnam War combat veterans with PTSD showed a 20% reduction in the volume of their hippocampus compared with veterans having suffered no such symptoms. This finding was not replicated in chronic PTSD patients traumatized at an air show plane crash in 1988 (Ramstein, Germany). A 2016 study strengthened theory that a smaller hippocampus increases the risk for post-traumatic stress disorder, and a larger hippocampus <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> efficacious treatment.|$|E
5|$|An {{interesting}} {{example of}} a bottleneck causing unusual genetic distribution is the relatively high proportion of individuals with total rod cell color blindness (achromatopsia) on Pingelap atoll in Micronesia. After a bottleneck, inbreeding increases. This increases {{the damage done by}} recessive deleterious mutations, in a process known as inbreeding depression. The worst of these mutations are selected against, leading to the loss of other alleles that are genetically linked to them, in a process of background selection. For recessive harmful mutations, this selection can be enhanced {{as a consequence of the}} bottleneck, due to genetic purging.This leads to a further loss of genetic diversity. In addition, a sustained reduction in population size <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> further allele fluctuations from drift in generations to come.|$|E

5|$|Nucleosidic solid supports. In a {{historically}} first and still popular approach, the 3'-hydroxy {{group of the}} 3'-terminal nucleoside residue {{is attached to the}} solid support via, most often, 3’-O-succinyl arm as in compound 3. The oligonucleotide chain assembly starts with the coupling of a phosphoramidite building block respective to the nucleotide residue second from the 3’-terminus. The 3’-terminal hydroxy group in oligonucleotides synthesized on nucleosidic solid supports is deprotected under the conditions somewhat milder than those applicable for universal solid supports. However, the fact that a nucleosidic solid support has to be selected in a sequence-specific manner reduces the throughput of the entire synthetic process and <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> human error.|$|E
5|$|The dental {{effects of}} {{long-term}} methamphetamine use are often attributed to {{its effects on}} saliva. The reduction in saliva <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> dental caries, enamel erosion, and periodontal disease. Although {{it is clear that}} use of the drug decreases saliva, the mechanism by which it does so is unclear. One theory is that the drug causes vasoconstriction (narrowing of the blood vessels) in salivary glands, decreasing salivary flow. This constriction is thought to be due to the activation of alpha-adrenergic receptors by both methamphetamine itself and norepinephrine, the levels of which are dramatically increased by methamphetamine use. These factors can be compounded by dehydration, which occurs in many methamphetamine users after drug-induced increases in metabolism. The characteristics of the saliva produced during use of the drug, which includes high protein content, may also contribute to the sensation of dry mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{those with}} cirrhosis, {{the risk of}} {{developing}} hepatic encephalopathy is 20% per year, and at any time about 30–45% of people with cirrhosis exhibit evidence of overt encephalopathy. The prevalence of minimal hepatic encephalopathy detectable on formal neuropsychological testing is 60–80%; this <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> developing overt encephalopathy in the future. Once hepatic encephalopathy has developed, the prognosis is determined largely by other markers of liver failure, such as the levels of albumin (a protein produced by the liver), the prothrombin time (a test of coagulation, which relies on proteins produced in the liver), the presence of ascites and the level of bilirubin (a breakdown product of hemoglobin which is conjugated and excreted by the liver). Together with the severity of encephalopathy, these markers have been incorporated into the Child-Pugh score; this score determines the one- and two-year survival and may assist in a decision to offer liver transplantation.|$|E

5|$|While Cabernet Sauvignon {{can grow}} {{in a variety}} of climates, its {{suitability}} as a varietal wine or as a blend component is strongly influenced by the warmth of the climate. The vine {{is one of the last}} major grape varieties to bud and ripen (typically 1–2 weeks after Merlot and Cabernet franc) and the climate of the growing season affects how early the grapes will be harvested. Many wine regions in California give the vine an abundance of sunshine with few problems in ripening fully, which <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> producing varietal Cabernet wines. In regions like Bordeaux, under the threat of inclement harvest season weather, Cabernet Sauvignon is often harvested a little earlier than ideal and is then blended with other grapes to fill in the gaps. In some regions, climate will be more important than soil. In regions that are too cool, there is a potential for more herbaceous and green bell pepper flavours from less than ideally ripened grapes. In regions where the grape is exposed to excess warmth and over-ripening, there is a propensity for the wine to develop flavours of cooked or stewed blackcurrants.|$|E

25|$|Males can {{ejaculate}} {{multiple times}} in a row, and this <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> pregnancy as well as decreases the number of stillborns.

Males also copulate at shorter intervals than females. In group mating, females often switch partners.|$|E
40|$|The Texas Statewide Youth Leadership Forum (TXYLF) {{provides}} self-advocacy {{training to}} high school youths with disabilities. TXYLF is an enhanced version of the Youth Leadership Forum (YLF) that is comprised of an initial five day training, a nine month support phase, regional YLFs, and the opportunity for participants {{to return to the}} five day training to serve as a mentor to their peers. This study?s purpose was to examine the TXYLF participants? post-training outcomes and the relationships among advocacy involvement and adult outcomes. To achieve this purpose, former TXYLF participants were surveyed between one and six years after their participation in TXYLF. The correlational study analyzed descriptively the participants? outcomes and inferentially, through logistic regression, the relationships among participants? adult outcomes, self-advocacy involvement, and the various TXYLF participation components. The results demonstrated that TXYLF participants? post-training postsecondary education attendance was higher than the national average for adults with disabilities. Participants with low incidence disabilities were involved in inclusive employment more often than the national average. A minority status <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> involvement in secondary education advocacy, having a high incident disability <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training employment, and being under 21 years old <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> living independently post-training, involvement in postsecondary education advocacy, and involvement in employment advocacy. Involvement in TXYLF for one full year, including involvement as a mentor, <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training employment; involvement in TXYLF?s nine month support phase and involvement as a mentor <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training postsecondary education attendance, postsecondary education advocacy, and employment advocacy. Attending a regional YLF further <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> postsecondary education and postsecondary education advocacy. Furthermore, involvement in TXYLF as a mentor <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>likelihood</b> <b>of</b> post-training employment, postsecondary education, and independent living.
