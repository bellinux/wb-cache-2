5|$|The nasals make {{up most of}} the crest. Brown {{assumed that}} they {{extended}} from the beaks' tip to the highest spot along the crest and that, unlike those in other genera, the nasals meet in the centre and are not separated in front by an ascending premaxillary process. Brown however, mistook the praemaxillae for the nasals; the snout is actually largely formed by them and they do separate the nasals. Brown also thought that on the top and back of the crest, the whole <b>external</b> <b>face</b> is covered by the frontals. Again he made a mistake: what he assumed to be the frontals are in fact the nasals. The nasals end {{at the back of the}} squamosals in a hooked, short process. The prefrontals also make up part of the crest; however, Brown mistook the lower upper branch of the praemaxilla for the prefrontal. The actual prefrontal, triangular in shape, is located at the side of the crest base; it was by Brown seen as a part of the frontal. The real frontals, largely internal to the crest base structure, are not visible from the side.|$|E

500|$|The Glassin Tower is a {{round tower}} {{that was built}} into the {{south-east}} corner of the ancient curtain wall, probably around 1550. The derivation of 'Glassin' is unknown. The purpose of the tower was to provide additional accommodation and to give the castle a more imposing appearance. Gunholes that allowed fire to be directed along the <b>external</b> <b>face</b> of the curtain wall improved defence. The tower has a vaulted basement for storing water, accessed separately from the courtyard. The basement has separate channels to allow water to be collected from the loch and waste water to be drained through a slop-drain. The lower chamber has an oriel window which would have given views over the loch. The upper chamber served as a bedchamber. At the very top a small room, accessible only from the wall walk, was possibly a study or library.|$|E

2500|$|Most ABC {{transporters}} that {{mediate the}} uptake of nutrients and other molecules in bacteria {{rely on a}} high-affinity solute binding protein (BP). BPs are soluble proteins located in the periplasmic space between {{the inner and outer}} membranes of gram-negative bacteria. Gram-positive microorganisms lack a periplasm such that their binding protein is often a lipoprotein bound to the <b>external</b> <b>face</b> of the cell membrane. Some gram-positive bacteria have BPs fused to the transmembrane domain of the transporter itself. The first successful x-ray crystal structure of an intact ABC importer is the molybdenum transporter (ModBC-A) from Archaeoglobus fulgidus. Atomic-resolution structures of three other bacterial importers, E. coli BtuCD, E. coli maltose transporter (MalFGK2-E), and the putative metal-chelate transporter of Haemophilus influenza, HI1470/1, have also been determined. The structures provided detailed pictures of the interaction of the transmembrane and ABC domains as well as revealed two different conformations with an opening in two opposite directions. Another common feature of importers is that each NBD is bound to one TMD primarily through a short cytoplasmic helix of the TMD, the [...] "coupling helix". This portion of the EAA loop docks in a surface cleft formed between the RecA-like and helical ABC subdomains and lies approximately parallel to the membrane bilayer.|$|E

40|$|Soil nailing is an {{economic}} and efficient method to reinforce soils, involving the insertion of threaded bars into natural unstable slope for increasing the overall stability or into cut slopes during the top-down process of excavation. The retained soil, the resisting reinforcements and the <b>external</b> <b>facing</b> are {{the main components of}} a soil-nailed structure.

To this aim, some tests with various facing types, differing in stiffness and continuity, were carried out so far in 1 g small scale physical model.

40|$|International audienceIn {{previous}} works, a semi-analytical model {{allowing the}} simulation of heat transfer in a mini-channel has been presented. This model does {{not rely on}} the local internal heat transfer coefficient distribution. The focus of this study concerns the experimental characterization of the conjugate heat transfer in a vertical flat mini-channel of 1 mm thickness. The objective here is to validate experimentally the previous approach on an experimental bench by using infrared thermography measurements on the <b>external</b> <b>faces</b> of the channel. The temperature observations are used then within an inverse approach in order to recover the external heat transfer coefficient (air) over the <b>external</b> <b>faces</b> (parameter estimation problem) {{as well as the}} internal boundary conditions (function estimation inverse problem). The interest of such an inverse approach, coupling a model and measurements, is to avoid introducing an intrusive instrumentation at this scale. It allows to validate a semi-analytical heat transfer model that takes into account conduction and advection in the fluid as well as conduction in the solid (conjugate heat transfer) without the use of any internal heat transfer coefficient...|$|R

Azay is a most perfect and beautiful thing; I should place it third in any list of the great houses {{of this part of}} France in which these houses should be ranked according to charm. For beauty of detail it comes after Blois and Chenonceaux, but it comes before Amboise and Chambord. On the other hand, of course it is inferior in majesty to either of these vast structures. Like Chenonceaux, it is a watery place, though it is more meagrely moated than the small château on the Cher. It consists of a large square corps de logis, with a round tower at each angle, rising out of a somewhat too slumberous pond. The water--the water of the Indre--surrounds it, but it is only on one side that it bathes its feet in the moat. On one of the others stretches a little terrace, treated as a garden, and in front prevails a wide court formed by a wing which, on the right, comes forward. This front, covered with sculptures, is of the richest, stateliest effect. The court is approached by a bridge over the pond, and the house would reflect itself in this wealth of water if the water were a trifle less opaque. But there is a certain stagnation--it affects more, senses than one--about the picturesque pools of Azay. On the hither side of the bridge is a garden overshadowed by fine old sycamores--a garden shut in by greenhouses and by a fine last-century gateway flanked with twin lodges. Beyond the château and the standing waters behind it is a so-called parc, which, however, it must be confessed, has little of park-like beauty.

The soberness of the main lines, the harmony of the empty spaces and those that are filled out, the prominence of the crowning parts, the delicacy of all the details, constitute an enchanting whole." [...] And then the Abbé speaks of the admirable staircase which adorns the north front and which, with its extension inside, constitutes the principal treasure of Azay. The staircase passes beneath one of the richest of porticos--a portico over which a monumental salamander indulges in the most decorative contortions. The sculptured vaults of stone which cover the windings of the staircase within, the fruits, flowers, ciphers, heraldic signs, are of the noblest effect.

6000|$|Without fastidiousness, it {{was fair}} to declare, {{on the other}} hand, that the little inn at Azay-le-Rideau was very bad.

I attached great importance to this incongruous hostess, for she uttered the only uncivil words I heard spoken (in connection with any business of my own) during a tour of some six weeks in France. Breakfast not at Azay-le-Rideau, therefore, too trustful traveller; or if you do so, be either very meek or very bold. Breakfast not, save under stress of circumstance; but let no circumstance whatever prevent you from going to see the admirable chateau, which is almost a rival of Chenonceaux. The village lies close to the gates, though after you pass these gates you leave it well behind. A little avenue, as at Chenonceaux, leads to the house, making a pretty vista as you approach the sculptured doorway.

The only defect of the house is the blankness and bareness of its walls, which have none of those delicate parasites attached to them that one likes to see on the surface of old dwellings. It is true that this bareness results in a kind of silvery whiteness of complexion, which carries out the tone of the quiet pools and even that of the scanty and shadeless park.|$|E
