50|$|There {{are various}} devices {{used to measure}} and {{regulate}} humidity. Calibration standards for the most accurate measurement include the gravimetric hygrometer, chilled mirror hygrometer, and <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hygrometer.</b> The gravimetric method, while the most accurate, is very cumbersome. For fast and very accurate measurement the chilled mirror method is effective.|$|E
40|$|Design of {{polymeric}} <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hygrometer</b> {{improved to}} meet need for reliable measurements of relative humidity in harsh environments of pulpmills and papermills. Redesigned sensor head features shorter, more-rigidly-held sensing element, less vulnerable than previous version to swell {{and loss of}} electrical contact. Useful for control of batch dryers in food and pharmaceutical industries...|$|E
40|$|An {{improved}} flow-through <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hygrometer</b> {{is described}} which utilizes a long lasting oxidation-resistant, hollow fiber formed from persulfonic acid substituted polytetrafluoroethylene having closely spaced noble metal electrodes {{in contact with}} the inner and outer surfaces of the fiber. The fiber is disposed within a chamber so that the moisture-bearing gas passes in contact with at least one surface of the fiber. The electrodes are connected in series to a dc voltage supply and an ammeter. As the gas passes through the chamber, moisture absorbed into the wall of the fiber is electrolyzed to hydrogen and oxygen by the closely spaced electrodes. The amount of electricity required for electrolysis is proportional to the absorbed moisture and is observed on the ammeter...|$|E
50|$|Resistive <b>electrolytic</b> <b>hygrometers</b> use a {{sensing element}} {{in the form of}} a liquid {{electrolyte}} held in between of two small glass rods by capillary force. The electrolyte changes resistance if it absorbs or loses water vapor. The resistance is directly proportional to relative air humidity, and also to water activity of the sample (once vapor-liquid equilibrium is established). This relation can be checked by either a verification or calibration using salt-water mixtures, which provide a well-defined and reproducible air humidity in the measurement chamber.|$|R
40|$|A solid <b>electrolytic</b> type <b>hygrometer</b> is described, which {{operates}} with high reliability while providing rapid and sensitive response. A gold foil electrode (16) is wrapped about a hollow glass cylinder (18), a sheet (12) of hygroscopic-electrolytic material is wrapped about the foil, and a wire (14) is wound {{around the outside}} of the electrolytic sheet. Moisture passing between wire turns can be absorbed by the electrolytic material (12), and then dissociated by current passed by the electrodes (14, 16) through the electrolytic material. The cylinder has a slit (20) extending along its length, to allow resilient expansion to press the sheet of electrolytic material firmly against the electrodes. The wire turns lie against one another to cause rapid dissociation of moisture throughout the electrolytic material. Additional guard wires (42, 44, FIG. 2) lie at opposite ends of the electrolytic sheet, and currents pass through them to avoid moisture buildup at the ends of the main wire coil. The electrical current through the sheet or membrane is proportional to the partial pressure of the water-vapor...|$|R
