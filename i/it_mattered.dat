25|$|Tchaikovsky {{is said to}} {{have argued}} with a friend who wagered that the {{composer}} could not write a melody based on a one-octave scale in sequence. Tchaikovsky asked if <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> whether the notes were in ascending or descending order, and was assured it did not. This resulted in the Adagio from the Grand pas de deux, which, in the ballet, nearly always immediately follows the Waltz of the Flowers. A story is also told that Tchaikovsky's sister had died shortly before he began composition of the ballet, and that his sister's death influenced him to compose a melancholy, descending scale melody for the adagio of the Grand Pas de Deux.|$|E

Then {{followed}} two matches in the National League, a 5-run loss to Middlesex first, before C Trophy champions Hampshire were bowled out for 69, giving Glamorgan a 151-run victory. Their Championship season was rounded off on 18 September with another loss, their fourteenth of the season, and they also lost their final League match to Gloucestershire.|$|E
25|$|The {{successor}} to Albert Sing had large shoes to fill; average performance {{was no longer}} acceptable to the discriminating Bernese supporters.

Although Geni Meier, Ernst Wechselberger and other players from the championship years continued to play, <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> little. Merkle was a hard coach of the German school, however, {{and was able to}} keep YB in {{the top half of the}} table, with finishes of second, fifth, and seventh. The mixture of old and young players did not provide the results the Bernese sought, however.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{his team}} being well on top, Waugh {{struggled}} {{in the early}} part of the Ashes series and he scored only 106 runs in four innings in the first three Tests. <b>It</b> <b>mattered</b> little to the match results; Australia crushed England in the First Test by 384 runs and proceeded to record consecutive innings victories. In the Fourth Test at the MCG, he scored 77 in the first innings and took his first Test wicket in four years; he did not bowl himself often as captain. However, his score of 14 in the second innings was characterised by many inside edges and false strokes led to increased speculation that he would be dropped. Australia managed to reach their target with five wickets down, despite a stumble on the final morning.|$|E
25|$|Symonds and Hussey {{batted out}} 15 overs, but Symonds {{struggled}} to hit runs and eventually smashed {{a drive to}} Andrew Strauss, who took a grateful catch, thus ending Symonds' innings for 29 – off 71 balls, a good innings in Test cricket but in ODI cricket virtually useless. Michael Vaughan then used a strange bowling change, keeping spinner Ashley Giles on for an over more than required and thus borrowing one from Andrew Flintoff who wasn't allowed to bowl a full ten. In the event, <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> little. Flintoff had ample time to rip out Brett Lee and Jason Gillespie, and, with Harmison taking care of Brad Hogg and Glenn McGrath committing batting suicide with a shot not exactly out of the textbook, Australia were all out for 196 – and England were comfortably in the drivers' seat.|$|E
25|$|Sammy led the West Indies in the 2012 World Twenty20 {{hosted by}} Sri Lanka. For {{the first time}} in a long time, the West Indies were {{considered}} realistic contenders for the title, a measure of how the team has matured under the auspices of Sammy. However, it was as an individual player that he came under scrutiny in the tournament. In the journey from group stages to the final, Sammy contributed 27 runs with the bat from four visits to the crease and overall bowling figures of 2/125, and drew a lot of criticism as many people felt he was keeping better players out of the side. But in the final, when <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> most, Sammy scored 26 not out from 15 balls and took two key wickets (almost matching his batting and bowling tally for the rest of the tournament) to help his team overcome a slow start and defeat Sri Lanka.|$|E

25|$|In 2008 Bath {{won their}} first {{silverware}} in 10 years, beating Worcester {{to win the}} European Challenge Cup. After defeat in the 2003 and 2007 finals, it was third time lucky for the English team who ground out an impressive win over Worcester Warriors at Kingsholm. Outgoing skipper Steve Borthwick led by example and was a tower of strength in the lineout {{on his way to}} becoming FedEx Man of the match. Bothwick, who joins Saracens next season, was carried aloft by his jubilant teammates after a titanic tussle in appalling conditions. Worcester won the toss and opted to play with the wind at their backs in the first period. <b>It</b> <b>mattered</b> not as Bath dominated possession and territory in the first quarter, and deservedly took the lead on 15 minutes with an Olly Barkley penalty. Barkley went on to score a second penalty a drop goal and a conversion, but it was tries from Jonny Fa'amatuainu and Nick Abendanon that put the game beyond the reach of brave Worcester. Bath won 24–16.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the match}} got on, Jones and Harmison {{putting on the}} {{pressure}} and eventually having Hayden lbw on 14 – after {{he had failed to}} score from the last 11 deliveries. Damien Martyn then faced five dot-balls, and Jones served up a wicket maiden, and Australia were at 46 for 2 {{at the end of the}} tenth over. However, that was as good as it got for England. Andrew Flintoff dug out skipper Ricky Ponting for 34, but <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> little, as Martyn and Andrew Symonds took advantage of the bowling. Michael Vaughan tried to put himself on, but Symonds smashed him over midwicket for six – the first of the match, displaying the despair. With some no-balls from Gough, and Simon Jones getting smashed early on, Australia were 220 for 4 after 42 overs, and looked on course for 300. However, the run-out of Symonds for 74 changed the course of the innings. Michael Clarke departed for three, a good catch by Geraint Jones behind the stumps, and Harmison then served up a wicket-maiden in the 46th over, of all things. With Brad Hogg and Jason Gillespie giving soft catches to Gough, that redeemed his figures somewhat, but he still conceded 70 runs. The last over from Flintoff was very good, however, conceding only three runs with yorkers directed at the feet of the batsmen, and Australia had to be content with 261 for 9.|$|E
25|$|On March 26 3rd-seeded Notre Dame faced {{off against}} Wichita State for a berth to the Elite Eight. Notre Dame {{defeated}} Wichita State 81 to 70 {{to set up}} a meeting with Kentucky two nights later. On March 28 Kentucky and Notre Dame met for a berth to the Final Four. In a game that was considered one of the greatest in NCAA Tournament history, Kentucky defeated Notre Dame 68 to 66. Kentucky needed its players to step up in a big game with such high stakes. Towns was foremost among players stepping up when <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> most. The 6-foot-11 forward played through foul trouble to score nine of his career-best 25 points over that final stretch, including the game-tying basket in the post with 1:12 left.The big 3 came with 3:15 on the clock. The Cats, {{in the midst of a}} rally after previously trailing by six points with 6:14 to go, trailed by just two when Aaron Harrison pulled up from the right wing. With six seconds left in an Elite Eight matchup with Notre Dame, Andrew Harrison drove and drew a foul on Notre Dame's Demetrius Jackson. Following a timeout called by the Fighting Irish, he toed the line in a 66-66 game and sank two free throws to give Kentucky a 68 to 66 lead. The margin remained intact as Notre Dame's Jerian Grant missed a contested 3-pointer as time expired. The game between Kentucky and Notre Dame was the highest rated college basketball game on cable of all-time.|$|E

500|$|The {{episode was}} written and is {{presented}} in a five-act structure to mirror theatrical norms. This allowed for jumps in time within the episode, as well as marking it out from others in the series. The plot is essentially based on Macbeth, leading Pemberton {{to suggest that the}} episode might be used [...] "on an O Level syllabus" [...] in the future. Unlike other episodes in the series, [...] "The Understudy" [...] did not take place in a family home, and for this reason, the writers were keen not to alienate viewers. After the initial idea of a group of characters backstage at a production of Macbeth, the writers re-scripted several times, unsure of whether the characters should be amateurs, members of a touring company or professionals. This meant that the script-writing took longer for [...] "The Understudy" [...] than for any other episode of the first series of Inside No. 9. The script eventually settled on actors at a West End theatre. For Shearsmith, <b>it</b> <b>mattered</b> that the actors had a [...] "real chance" [...] and that there were high stakes. The episode, he suggested, reflected happenings in a real theatre, rather than a television version.
