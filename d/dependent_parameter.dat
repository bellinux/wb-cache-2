For the first time, the work has experimentally captured the decrease of internal resistance at an increasing current of up to the C-rate of 25 and developed an equivalent circuit model (ECM) with current <b>dependent</b> <b>parameters.</b> The model is integrated to extended Kalman filter (EKF) to improve SOC estimation, which is validated by experimental data collected in dynamic stress testing (DST).

We aimed to define and completely analyze new parameters, such as the number of Taylor cones per square meter, the spinning performance for one Taylor cone, total spinning performance, fiber diameter uniformity coefficient and non-fibrous area percentage. Also, new measurement methods were developed and explained to analyze these parameters. According to the experimental results, strong and significant relationships between independent and <b>dependent</b> <b>parameters</b> of roller electrospinning were found. These independent and depend-ent parameters were affected by varying the concentrations of polyurethane and tetraethylammoniumbromide (TEAB) salt. In particular, the spinnability of the polymer solution, which is the most important factor for the roller electro-spinning method, significantly increased with the TEAB concentration. If the spinning performance is positive, a specific solution is spinnable. However, the solution is not spinnable if the spinning performance is zero...|$|R
