5|$|Barkley's message {{sparked a}} great public {{debate about the}} nature of role models. He argued, I think the media demands that athletes be role models because there's some jealousy involved. It's as if they say, this is a young black kid playing a game for a living and making all this money, so we're going to make <b>it</b> <b>tough</b> on him. And what they're really doing is telling kids to look up to someone they can't become, because not many people can be like we are. Kids can't be like Michael Jordan.|$|E

Coincidentally, her husband, Shankar, is in Saudi Arabia, his new workplace. Meera finds <b>it</b> <b>tough</b> without her husband but they manage to stay in touch. Shankar regularly sends his wages home to support his family that includes his father, Randhir Singh (Girish Karnad), mother, Gowri Singh (Prateeksha Lonkar), his paternal grandmother (Uttara Baokar) and Meera. One day, Meera does not find the remittance from Shankar. Time passes and when there are neither any further remittances nor any correspondence from her husband, Meera gets worried. When frantic inquiries are made, she is devastated to know that Shankar was killed in a freak accident that was allegedly caused by his Muslim roommate.|$|E

Sol {{has never met}} a girl like Naz before, and Cole said Naz {{probably}} has not met boys like Sol before either. Hussen said {{that there is something}} about Sol that attracts Naz. She is stronger than he is so Naz likes to take him in and teach him things. Cole explained that Sol is attracted to Naz because she is different from other girls and they are complete opposites. and Sol depends on him. Looking after Sol takes a toll on Asher, however. One of Cole's first scenes to film was a kiss between Sol and Naz. Cole found <b>it</b> <b>tough</b> and awkward as the actors had only just met, and would have preferred it to be filmed later on, but said that the scene was awkward anyway so {{he did not have to}} act much for it. Sol has also been described as shy, caring, sweet, thoughtful, soft, easily hurt and reserved.|$|E

It was killed for food; Gemelli Careri found the meat tasty, but Gundlach considered <b>it</b> <b>tough.</b> Archaeological evidence suggests the Cuban macaw was hunted in Havana in the 16th–18th centuries. It may also have been persecuted as a crop pest, though it did not live near dwellings.|$|E

500|$|Although a {{male voice}} actor was sought for the Japanese {{adaptation}} of the Naruto role, the actress Junko Takeuchi was chosen instead over many male applicants. Before recording the first episode, Takeuchi noticed several lines from the script that ended with exclamation marks, which helped her to define Naruto's voice. She noted difficulties in transitioning from the young Naruto to the older Naruto in the animated adaptation of Part II. She had to record the first episode of Part II when Naruto's character was older and more mature only one week after voicing the younger, immature character. Nine years after first voicing the character, while still finding <b>it</b> <b>tough</b> to voice Naruto, Takeuchi's opinion of him changed with her feeling he was [...] "a very reliable young man". She admired his ability to prioritize and calmly make important decisions, and believes these traits will inspire viewers worldwide.|$|E

500|$|Marrara Oval {{became the}} 89th Test venueand the eighth in Australia.

[...] All four Australian bowlers chimed in, as Glenn McGrath and Brett Lee took three wickets apiece. McGrath and Jason Gillespie surpassed the duo of Keith Miller and Ray Lindwall as Australia's most successful opening-bowling combination. Bangladesh's shot selection did not impress coach Dav Whatmore who said, [...] "A few players presented their wickets and that's just the area we're trying to improve." [...] Australia initially struggled {{to come to terms with}} the pitch, falling to 2/43 when Ricky Ponting was dismissed for 10. Darren Lehmann started the carnage, scoring his second Test century (110). Steve Waugh then became only the second player after Gary Kirsten to score a century against all Test playing nations. Upon reaching the milestone, he promptly declared Australia's innings on 7/407. Only Bangladesh's fastest bowler, Mashrafe Mortaza proved threatening, taking three wickets for 74 runs (3/74) in 23 overs. After the days play, Lehmann said, [...] "It was hard work out there.

500|$|Upon its {{publication}} in English in early 2009, The Kindly Ones received mixed reviews. The New Republics literary critic Ruth Franklin called it [...] "one {{of the most}} repugnant books I have ever read [...] if getting under {{the skin of a}} murderer were sufficient to produce a masterpiece, then Thomas Harris would be Tolstoy." [...] Michiko Kakutani, the principal book critic of The New York Times, called the novel [...] "illfully sensationalistic and deliberately repellent" [...] and went on to question the [...] "perversity" [...] of the French literary establishment for praising the novel. In a reply to Kakutani, writer and novelist Michael Korda wrote, [...] "You want to read about Hell, here it is. If you don’t have the strength to read <b>it,</b> <b>tough</b> shit. It’s a dreadful, compelling, brilliantly researched, and imagined masterpiece, a terrifying literary achievement, and perhaps the first work of fiction {{to come out of the}} Holocaust that places us in its very heart, and keeps us there." [...] Writing for Time, American writer and journalist Lev Grossman compared it to Roberto Bolaño's 2666, similar in [...] "their seriousness of purpose, their wild overestimation of the reader's attention span and their interest in physical violence that makes Saw look like Dora the Explorer," [...] but added that while far from perfect, The Kindly Ones [...] "is unmistakably the work of a profoundly gifted writer, if not an especially disciplined one." [...] In her review for Los Angeles Times, novelist and essayist Laila Lalami wrote: [...] "Jonathan Littell has undertaken a very ambitious project in The Kindly Ones, and I think his boldness deserves to be commended. In the end, however, his highly problematic characterization and awkward handling of point of view make this book far more successful as a dramatized historical document than as a novel." [...] British historian Antony Beevor, author of Stalingrad and The Fall of Berlin 1945, reviewing The Kindly Ones in The Times, called it [...] "a great work of literary fiction, to which readers and scholars will turn for decades to come," [...] and listed it as one of the top five books of World War II fiction.|$|E
