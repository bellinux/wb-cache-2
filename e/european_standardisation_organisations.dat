40|$|For the {{optimization}} of {{the performance}} and reliability of advanced integrated, application specific circuits (ASICs) during the development phase, {{it is necessary to}} assess the design related, inherent characteristics and limits of the respective semiconductor technology. An important prerequisite is a well defined and accepted technology assessment system acting as interface between semiconductor suppliers and chip designers. The strategy for such a transparent, fully foundry independent characterisation system has already been developed during {{the first phase of the}} project JESSI AC 41. The following report describes the work carried out at Alcatel SEL during phase 2 to realize and to verify this common, widely automated technology assessment system for submicrometer semiconductor technologies, which consists of: common, technology supplier independent test structures and mini test chips; compact, physical transistor model for submicrometer CMOS technologies; agreed test methods for technology and reliability parameters; agreed parameter extraction procedures; common data exchange format.

40|$|Standards are an {{important}} part of the codified knowledge of a society. In contrast to industry standards, formal standards are created in a consensus-based procedure open to all interested parties. Only if an economic interest for application exists will formal standards be produced. Interested parties have to shoulder participation costs themselves, which enforces economic interest. Up to a certain extent, governments also trigger and finance formal standardisation processes through the new approach, which creates a framework that is filled by private activity. Standards stand at the end of intellectual property rights if the totality of the value chain of knowledge production is looked at. One important aspect is their accessibility and the inclusion of all necessary intellectual property rights, especially patents, at reasonable prices. Conversely, consortia may exclude groups from the use of their standards. By preventing the licensing of those patents included in a standard, they can effectively block market entry. Thus, “successful” standards often face antitrust problems. Formal standards reduce costs of production through economies of scale, economies of scope and network-economies. Goods and processes that are standardized signal quality, the inclusion of high technological standards and permanent presence in the markets, which again accelerates market dissemination. Firms face a dilemma: On the one hand, the penetration of a markets with industry standards offers potentials for high profits; on the other hand, this has to be balanced against the risk of failure, especially if clients are hesitant because they do not know which standard will be successful in the end. Formal standards create and stabilize trust markets. This is especially true in the area of globalisation. Europe, which has to face an enormous competition in the international knowledge economy, needs an institutionally efficient approach to formal standardisation.

40|$|This {{report has}} been {{developed}} within the project “Technical support for Environmental Footprinting, material efficiency in product policy and the European Platform on LCA” (2013 - 2016) funded by Directorate General Environment, {{and focused on the}} development of a standardisable method with a verifiable metric to assess the reversible disassembly of electrical and electronic equipment (EEE). The main motivation of this study was the need for a robust method to evaluate the ability to access or remove certain components from products to facilitate their repair, reuse or recycling. Such a method is developed to serve different purposes, such as product design optimization, compliance to policies and end-of-life treatment improvement. Such a work is particularly relevant to the 2015 Circular Economy action plan that will “promote reparability, upgradability, durability and recyclability of products” through Ecodesign Directive and to the mandate addressed to <b>European</b> <b>standardisation</b> <b>organisations</b> in 2015 to develop standards on material efficiency of energy related products (ErP). The report provides a scientific background, with the review of current methods available in the literature, which were grouped into: 1) methods to categorise manual operations and disassembly actions and 2) methods to calculate the ease of disassembly of products. Based on the presented literature review, the proposed method focused on the identification of relevant product parameters and disassembly actions to be used for the calculation of a disassembly index. In particular, the authors have identified six basic and relevant disassembly actions of an average disassembly process: 1) Tool change, 2) Identifying connectors, 3) Manipulation of the product, 4) Positioning, 5) Disconnection and 6) Removing. For each of them, and for each type of fastener, a table of reference values was determined. Successively, an innovative disassembly index has been proposed and named as “ease of Disassembly Metric” (eDiM). Given a product and the sequence of actions to disassemble it, the eDiM calculation consists of associating a value of the reference table to each of these actions. The summation of these values finally results in the eDiM for the considered product and disassembly sequence. The eDiM index assesses the effort needed to completely or partially disassemble a product. The index is also representing an estimation of the time necessary for the disassembly and therefore it is expressed in standards unit of measurement for time (seconds). The eDiM index was tested on a 14 ” flat panel monitor (LCD), a small electronic device with a weight of 2. 6 kg that can be disassembled on a workbench. The eDiM was calculated for the complete disassembly and also for the selective extraction of certain components, as the Printed Wiring Boards. The calculated values were also compared to the disassembly performed by a professional operator, in order to measure the possible deviations. Considering the complete disassembly, the comparison between calculated eDiM and measured values resulted in a limited difference (the calculated eDiM was 8. 5 % higher than the measured value), with the largest deviation observed for the disassembly action of “Identifying connectors”. Based on {{the results of the present}} analysis, the authors positively concluded on the feasibility to develop a robust and potentially standardisable method to assess the ease of disassembly of EEE. The method is based on information about the product composition and fastening that can be directly verified on the product. Authors also concluded that the proposed method is suitable to support product design for disassembly and policies for ecodesign.  JRC. H. 8 -Sustainability Assessmen...|$|E
40|$|The European Commission has {{published}} in May 2009 a recommendation "on {{the implementation of}} privacy and data protection principles in applications supported by radio-frequency identification", {{which is designed to}} provide "guidance to Member States on the design and operation of RFID applications in a lawful, ethical and socially and politically acceptable way, respecting the right to privacy and ensuring protection of personal data. " This recommendation requires RFID operators to conduct a "Privacy and Data Protection Impact Assessment" before an RFID application is deployed, and make its results available to the competent authority. The RFID recommendation is also designed to promote "information and transparency on RFID use", in particular through the development of "a common European sign developed by <b>European</b> <b>Standardisation</b> <b>Organisations,</b> with the support of concerned stakeholders", designed "to inform individuals of the presence of readers". The RFID PIA (Privacy and Impact Asssessment) process aims to reach several objectives: * to favour "privacy by design" by helping data controllers to address privacy and data protection before a product or service is deployed, * to help data controllers to address privacy and data protection risks in a comprehensive manner. an opportunity to reduce legal uncertainty and avoid loss of trust from consumers, * to help data controllers and data protection authorities to gain more insight into the privacy and data protection aspects of RFID applications. The industry has proposed a RFID PIA framework which classifies a RFID application into 4 possible levels: Level 0 applications, which essentially cover RFID applications that do not process personal data and where tags are only manipulated by users, and which are rightly excluded from conducting a PIA. Level 1 applications cover applications where no personal data is processed, yet tags are carried by individuals. Level 2 applications process personal data but where tags themselves do not contain personal data. Level 3 applications where tags contain personal data. If the RFID application level is determined to be 1 or above, the RFID operator is then required to conduct a four part analysis of the application, with a level of detail that is proportionate to identified privacy and data protection implications. The first part is used to describe the RFID application. The second part allows highlighting control and security measures. The third part addresses user information and rights. The final part of the proposed PIA framework requires the RFID operator to conclude whether or not the RFID application is ready for deployment. As a result of the PIA process, the RFID operator will produce a PIA report that will be made available to the competent authority. For the industry, only levels 2 and 3 are to be submitted to a PIA because it considers that information contained in a tag at level 1 are not personal. However level 1 arises concerns of Article 29 Working Party because tagged items carried by a person contain unique identifiers that could be read remotely. In turn, these unique identifiers could be used to recognize that particular person through time. It raises the possibility that a person will be tracked without his knowledge by a third party. When a unique identifier is associated to a person, it falls in the definition of personal data set forth in Directive 95 / 46 /EC, regardless {{of the fact that the}} "social identity" (name, address, etc.) of the person remains unknown (i. e. he is "identifiable" but not necessarily "identified"). Additionally, the unique number contained in a tag can also serve as a means to remotely identify the nature of items carried by a person, which in turn may reveal information about social status, health, or more. Thus, even in those cases where a tag contains solely a number that is unique within a particular context, and no additional personal data, care must be taken to address potential privacy and security issues if this tag is going to be carried by persons. The Working Party has urged the industry to fully address this issue, by clearly mentioning it in the framework as part of a revised risk assessment approach for level 1. This chapter will address the issue of protecting privacy of RFID tag carriers in a privacy by design model which puts them in a position to decide if they accept or not to be tracked at level 1. In case of a negative decision, tags have to be deactivated. Security measures have also to be taken to protect personal information on RFID tags against information leak which could lead to identity theft...|$|E
