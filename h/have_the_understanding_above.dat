This research is quasi experiment. Sample selection was done by using random class technique twice, where the first class was taught problem solving model while the second class was taught conventional learning. The instrument which was used consisted of the tests of problem solving ability and test of <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> concept. The data in this research was analyzed by using two way anova. The result of this research showed that the students 2 ̆ 7 problem solving ability who was taught problem solving model was better than the students 2 ̆ 7 problem solving ability who was taught conventional, the students 2 ̆ 7 problem solving ability with <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> concept <b>above</b> the average showed a better result than <b>the</b> students with <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> concept below the average, and there was an interaction between problem solving model and <b>understanding</b> <b>the</b> concept on the students 2 ̆ 7 problem solving abilit...|$|R
