It discusses three virtues that Gawande considers to be most important for success in medicine: diligence, <b>doing</b> <b>right,</b> and ingenuity. Gawande offers examples {{in the book of}} people who have embodied these virtues. The book strives to present multiple sides of contentious medical issues, such as malpractice law in the US, physicians' role in capital punishment, and treatment variation between hospitals.|$|E

It's going to go to zero in 2010. And then in 2011, it's going to go to 55 percent. And we have to make sure that the tax cuts that went into effect, that that level remains. Otherwise, we're going to have one of the biggest tax increases in history in 2011. And I would look to try to regularize the rates and look for some marginal reduction, even beyond what we're <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> now.|$|E

25|$|Hashtags (#topic) and user tags (@username) {{make use}} of {{metadata}} in order to track “trending” topics and to alert users of their name’s use within a post on a social media site. Used by various social media websites (most notably Twitter and Facebook), these features add internal linkage between users and themes. Characteristics of a multimodal feature can be seen through the status update option on Facebook. Status updates combine the affordances of personal blogs, Twitter, instant messaging, and texting in a single feature. The 2013 status update button currently prompts a user, “What’s on your mind?” a change from the 2007, “What are you <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> now?” This change was added by Facebook to promote greater flexibility for the user. This multimodal feature allows a user to add text, video, image, links, and tag other users. Twitter's 140 character in a single message microblogging platform allows users the ability to link to other users, websites, and attach pictures. This new media is a platform that is affecting the literacy practice of the current generation by condensing the conversational context of the internet into fewer characters but encapsulating several media.|$|E
500|$|Tom Noonan, {{who played}} killer Francis Dollarhyde, {{initially}} researched other serial killers {{to study for}} the role, but was repulsed by it.

[...] "I wanted to feel this guy was doing the best he could", Noonan explained, [...] "that he was doing this out of love". Noonan credits his casting to improvisation during his audition, recalling that he was reading lines alongside a young woman. During a reading of the scene featuring the torture of Freddy Lounds, Noonan noticed that the woman began to seem frightened, and deliberately tried to scare her more. He believed that this is what secured the role for him.|$|E

Michael's later conversation with David Wallace set an important foundation for both the season and the series, as it established that several people would be competing for a corporate job and solidified the CFO as an important character.

500|$|Once the {{abolition}} of slavery in the rebel states became a military objective, as Union armies advanced south, more slaves were liberated until all three million of them in Confederate territory were freed. Lincoln's comment on the signing of the Proclamation was: [...] "I never, in my life, felt more certain that I was <b>doing</b> <b>right,</b> than I do in signing this paper." [...] For some time, Lincoln continued earlier plans to set up colonies for the newly freed slaves. He commented favorably on colonization in the Emancipation Proclamation, but all attempts at such a massive undertaking failed. A few days after Emancipation was announced, 13 Republican governors met at the War Governors' Conference; they supported the president's Proclamation, but suggested the removal of General George B.

500|$|The {{second season}} of Homicide drew several {{comparisons}} to NYPD Blue, an ABC police drama series that had debuted in September 1993. It received {{a large amount}} of publicity and better ratings than Homicide, which some reviewers attributed to the violence and nudity featured in the show. Like Homicide, NYPD Blue featured an ensemble cast and intertwined subplots, and commentators suggested its success may have encouraged NBC to support Homicide. Levinson said he was not deterred by comparisons to NYPD Blue because Homicide debuted before that series. In a news article, Fontana quoted a friend who described NYPD Blue as [...] "the television version of Homicide". Baldwin was even more critical of the show, and said in an interview: [...] "The ultimate compliment that can ever be paid [...] to be mimicked by someone else. So, thank you, NYPD Blue, because it's the knockoff of Homicide." [...] NYPD Blue co-creator Steven Bochco took exception to that characterization, saying he believed his reputation and experience in television proved he was capable of conceiving his own material. Bochco said: I don't think it's a knock-off. It was conceived as its own show. I wish Homicide the best [...] and they should be so lucky as to do as well as we're <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> now." ...|$|E

The video was filmed completely on location, {{with none of the}} scenes shot on green screens. The video primarily consists of Spears, whilst wearing cowboy boots, performing the song whilst standing {{on the edge of a}} cliff, and inside a cave: despite her [...] "trepidation" [...] and heavy winds which [...] "almost dropped [...] over", she performed the scene without a safety cable. Isham praised Spears' attitude to the filming of the scene, claiming that she [...] "had not a blink of fear" [...] during the shoot, Spears is sitting on top of a cliff, surrounded by cliffs. Isham also considered the music video one of his favorites, commenting that he had [...] "nothing but positive things to say about my experience with her and what she's <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> now" [...] and that Spears [...] "stepped into it with positive energy. She ended up stepping out and kicking ass, There are 3 versions of the video, Version 1 and 2 has clips from the movie [...] "Crossroads" [...] and Version 3 is the original version." [...] The music video won the award for [...] "International Music Video of the Year Short-Form" [...] on the 2003 Japan Gold Disc Awards.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} {{for the song}} was {{directed}} by long-time collaborator Melina Matsoukas and Knowles under the alias Bee-Z. The video took two-three weeks of preparation and one day to film in Los Angeles on Mount Olympus. The main set of the video was a house owned by a wealthy 95-year-old man who allowed Knowles and Matsoukas to use his house and collectible cars for the video shoot. During an interview with USA Today on January 28, 2010, Knowles announced {{that she would be}} taking a break from her music career saying [...] "to live life, to be inspired by things again". She was then inspired to shoot a music video for the bonus track. In an interview with People magazine in August 2010, Knowles explained: [...] "I came up with the concept for that video because lately I decided to take a break, and I’ve been home, being a wife. I figured it could be nice to give a little wink toward the things that I’ve been doing, so that’s why I’m a housewife in the video." [...] However, she explained that the video is [...] "an exaggerated, over-the-top version" [...] of what she was <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> then, just living her life, being a woman at home, relaxing and trying to enjoy her life other than performing and creating music. For instance, dusting off her Grammys and getting under the hood of a car while wearing six-inch heels are not regular occurrences for Knowles.|$|E
500|$|Like God of War, {{the game}} uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine. Senior combat {{designer}} Derek Daniels {{said that for}} God of War II, they were basing the magical attacks on elements (e.g., air and earth). He said the combat system was updated so that it flowed smoothly between attacks and switching between weapons and magic. He {{said that they were}} working for a similar balance of puzzle solving, exploration, and combat seen in the first game, and they used elements that worked in that game as a base for the overall balance. Unlike God of War where magic had a small role, Daniels said that for God of War II, their goal was to make magic {{an integral part of the}} combat system and to make it more refined. Barlog said the game would feature new creatures and heroes from the mythology, and he wanted to put more boss battles in it. Commenting on multiplayer options, Barlog said that [...] "there are possibilities for that but it is not something we are <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> now." [...] He said that he felt that God of War is a single-player experience, and although multiplayer [...] "would be cool," [...] it did not appeal to him to work on. As for a PlayStation Portable (PSP) installment, he said that he thought it [...] "would be freaking awesome," [...] but not something he had time to work on and it was Sony's decision whether or not to make a PSP installment.|$|E

She knows if she's trying something on that doesn't fit right for her. She's like, 'No, that's not me.' She's not one to strap {{on some sort of}} fake image." [...] Christy also claimed to be impressed with Spears's vocal ability during the recording of [...] "Shadow". Steve Anderson, Lisa Greene and Stephen Lee wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] at Metrophonic Studios in London, England. Before meeting with the other writers, Anderson thought of two concepts for songs specifically for Spears: one he had worked on [...] "for ages", and [...] "Breathe on Me", which he drafted {{on the morning of the}} sessions. Greene and Lee did not like the first concept, and they wrote [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] with Anderson. The song was produced by Mark Taylor, who kept most of the programming done by Anderson. With Taylor, Spears recorded [...] "Breathe on Me" [...] and [...] "And Then We Kiss", which did not make the album. Before the album was released, Spears's manager Larry Rudolph commented that it was important for Spears to continue moving away from a traditional pop sound, citing [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U" [...] and [...] "Boys" [...] from Britney as departures from her previous music. Barry Weiss, then-president of Jive Label Group, added, [...] "She has achieved what she set out to achieve, which was to make a mature album that didn't sound like something she would have done three years while still making a commercial album that has hit singles. [...] It's the kind of record she should be <b>doing</b> <b>right</b> now, and it came down to her to make it." [...] In the Zone was recorded at Battery Studios and The Dojo in New York City, 3:20 Studios, Decoy Studios, Pacifique Studios, Record Plant in Los Angeles, California, Westlake Recording Studios in West Hollywood, California, The Chocolate Factory, in Chicago, Illinois, Triangle Sound Studios in Atlanta, Georgia, Metrophonic Studios and Olympic Studios in London, England, and Murlyn Studios in Stockholm, Sweden. Throughout the beginning of 2003, Spears started testing tracks by playing them in nightclubs such as Show in New York City.|$|E
