500|$|Steinbeck {{continued}} {{to write in}} late 1953 while Hammerstein and Rodgers went to London to produce the West End production of The King and I. As Hammerstein received new material from Steinbeck, he and Rodgers began to map out the musical, conceiving scenes and deciding where songs should be placed. On January 1, 1954, following the completion of Steinbeck's novel, Hammerstein began to write dialogue and lyrics. Sweet Thursday was published in early 1954 to mixed reviews. Steinbeck later commented, [...] "Some of the critics are so concerned for my literary position that they can't read a book of mine without worrying where it will fit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place</b> in history. Who gives a damn?" [...] By that time, Rodgers and Hammerstein were busy producing {{the film version of}} Oklahoma! ...|$|E
500|$|Alexandra {{undertook}} {{many public}} duties; {{in the words}} of Queen Victoria, [...] "to spare me the strain and fatigue of functions. She opens bazaars, attends concerts, visits hospitals <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place...</b> she not only never complains, but endeavours to prove that she has enjoyed what to another would be a tiresome duty." [...] She took a particular interest in the London Hospital, visiting it regularly. Joseph Merrick, the so-called [...] "Elephant Man", was one of the patients whom she met. Crowds usually cheered Alexandra rapturously, but during a visit to Ireland in 1885, she suffered a rare moment of public hostility when visiting the City of Cork, a hotbed of Irish nationalism. She and her husband were booed by a crowd of two to three thousand people brandishing sticks and black flags. She smiled her way through the ordeal, which the British press still portrayed in a positive light, describing the crowds as [...] "enthusiastic". As part of the same visit, she received a Doctorate in Music from Trinity College, Dublin.|$|E

2500|$|The marble gravestone of a Saracen {{girl named}} Majmuna (pr. My-moona), {{found in a}} pagan temple in the Xewkija area of Gozo dates back to 1173. Written in Kufic, it concludes saying, [...] "You who read this, see that dust covers my eyelids, <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place</b> and in my house, nothing but sadness and weeping; what will my resurrection be like?" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "My fellow {{directors}} of Little River Band {{at the time}} {{wanted to do a}} five-month tour. I felt that a three-month commitment was sufficient. They had another agenda and I was informed by fax that they would be employing a substitute vocalist <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place.</b> I attempted to stop them, I sought advice, stepped down, and accepted a financial settlement in lieu of earnings." [...] Glenn Shorrock (2005) ...|$|E
2500|$|On August 23, 1939, Adolf Hitler's Germany and Joseph Stalin's USSR {{signed a}} non-aggression agreement, {{known as the}} Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, which {{contained}} a secret addendum (revealed only in 1945), dividing Eastern Europe into spheres of influence. Latvia was thereby assigned to the Soviet sphere. Following a Soviet ultimatum in October 1939, Ulmanis had to sign the Soviet–Latvian Mutual Assistance Treaty and allow Soviet military bases in Latvia. In June 17, 1940, Latvia was completely occupied by the Soviet Union. Ulmanis ordered Latvians to show no resistance to the Soviet Army, saying in his radio speech [...] "I will remain <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place</b> and you remain in yours".|$|E

2500|$|That is {{when the}} man Herrera had {{believed}} to be his father gave him the stunning news of his Mexican birth, and said, [...] "Son, you don't have to go, they can't draft you...you aren't an American citizen." [...] Even {{in the face of}} these multiple shocks, and a perfect opportunity to dodge the war, Herrera was unswayed. [...] As he later related, [...] "I thought, I'm going anyway. [...] I didn't want anybody to die <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place...</b> I felt that I had my adopted country that had been so nice to me. [...] I thought, I have an American wife and the kids and one on the way." [...] It was only the first of several life-changing acts of heroism Herrera would take.|$|E
2500|$|When the war ended, Laine {{soon found}} himself [...] "scuffling" [...] again, and was {{eventually}} given {{a place to}} stay by Jarvis. Jarvis also did his best to help promote the struggling singer's career, and Laine soon had a small, regional following. In the meantime, Laine would make the rounds of the bigger jazz clubs, hoping that the featured band would call him up to perform a number with them. In late 1946, Hoagy Carmichael heard him singing at Billy Berg's club in Los Angeles, and this was when success finally arrived. Not knowing that Carmichael was in the audience, Laine sang the Carmichael-penned standard [...] "Rockin' Chair" [...] when Slim Gaillard called him up to the stage to sing. This eventually led to a contract with the newly established Mercury records. Laine and Carmichael would later collaborate on a song, [...] "Put Yourself <b>in</b> <b>My</b> <b>Place,</b> Baby".|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} year, the Dodgers {{advanced to}} the World Series {{for the first time}} in 29 years. Despite many Dodgers fans petitioning Scully to come out of retirement, including Fox Sports announcer Joe Buck (who was quoted as saying, [...] "I swear on my late father, to have Vin come do some of the series with us and <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place</b> would be an honor"), Scully declined, preferring to keep a low profile and responding that [...] "I’ve done enough of them." [...] Scully's decision echoed that of Myron Cope, who had retired after the 2004 season as the Pittsburgh Steelers color commentator, only to see the team advance to Super Bowl XL the following season and an unsuccessful fan petition to have Cope call that game. Scully did, however, take part in the first pitch ceremony prior to Game 2 with Steve Yeager and Fernando Valenzuela, teammates on the Dodgers team that won the 1981 World Series.|$|E

60|$|LUBIN. It {{leaves me}} sitting, and quite comfortable, thank you. Go on sweeping. When you {{are tired of}} it, come back; {{and you will find}} England where it was, and me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> {{accustomed}} <b>place,</b> with Miss Savvy telling me all sorts of interesting things.|$|R
2500|$|Our {{mechanic}} {{and general}} runner was David Nice, an Englishman from Colchester, {{who was not}} unlike me in a way, for his nose appeared to be, profile view anyway, very similar to mine (poor lad!) and I hit on the splendid idea of putting him out on the track <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place</b> during the neutralised period. Tracksuited, a scarf over {{the lower part of}} his face and a Russian hat that I had bought completed the disguise. He was me to anyone giving a cursory glance at the figures plodding round the track. The get-up was quite in order for it became very cold there at night as they used to turn off all the heating. Everything went well for the first night of the wheeze and I congratulated myself on the plan. It could not go on [...] for ever, though, worse luck, for on the very next night the game was up. Dave was trundling round wrapped up to the eyebrows as before when, horrors upon horrors, the track manager, who often rode a bike round himself during the quiet time, started to talk to him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I didn't know I looked white," [...] {{says the}} trooper, passing {{his hand over}} his brow, [...] "and I didn't know I looked shocked, and I'm sorry I do. But the truth is, that boy who was taken <b>in</b> at <b>my</b> <b>place</b> died {{yesterday}} afternoon, and it has rather knocked me over." ...|$|R
6000|$|Julian {{kept his}} temper perfectly. [...] "Pardon me," [...] he rejoined, [...] "you forget {{that you and}} Lady Janet meet {{now for the first}} time. Try to put {{yourself}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> aunt's <b>place.</b> How is she to know that you are the late Colonel Roseberry's daughter?" ...|$|R
60|$|Once <b>in</b> <b>my</b> new <b>place</b> of concealment, I {{watched them}} as they {{approached}} the tree. There were about thirty men in the party and one woman--a girl whose hands seemed to be bound behind her and who was being pulled along by two of the men.|$|R
60|$|A man <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place</b> {{might have}} known what to do. Being only a woman, I yielded to the {{compassionate}} impulse of the moment.|$|E

60|$|MARY DRISCOLL: (Indignantly) I'm {{not a bad}} one. I bear {{a respectable}} {{character}} and was four months <b>in</b> <b>my</b> last <b>place.</b> I was in a situation, six pounds a year and my chances with Fridays out and I had to leave owing to his carryings on.|$|R
60|$|ANN. [thoughtfully] I don't {{think there}} would be any harm in that, Jack. You are my guardian: you stand <b>in</b> <b>my</b> father's <b>place,</b> by his own wish.

60|$|I had not {{had enough}} of it, and I should have been quite content to have made one of the mob for some time longer. But I saw that Oscar would be seriously vexed if I persisted <b>in</b> keeping <b>my</b> <b>place.</b> So I took leave of my nice old lady, and left the {{pleasant}} sands--not very willingly.|$|R
60|$|What {{would the}} Good Samaritan have done <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>place?</b> Assuredly {{he would have}} run the risk and opened the door. I imitated the Good Samaritan.|$|E

60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. I {{hear you}} have such {{pleasant}} society in America. Quite like our own <b>in</b> <b>places,</b> <b>my</b> son wrote to me.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I saw her,’ {{he went on}} to say, not answering, but {{engaged in}} the same slow pursuit of his own thoughts. ‘There she stood: trembling! “How does she look, Richard? Does she ever speak of me? Is she thinner? <b>My</b> old <b>place</b> at the table: what’s <b>in</b> <b>my</b> old <b>place?</b> And the frame she taught me our old work on—has she burnt it, Richard!” There she was. I heard her say it.’ ...|$|R
