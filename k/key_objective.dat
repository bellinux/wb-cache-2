5|$|Operation Graffham formed part of Operation Bodyguard, a broad {{strategic}} military deception {{intended to}} confuse the Axis high command as to Allied intentions during the lead-up to the Normandy landings. One of the key elements of Bodyguard was Operation Fortitude North, which promoted a fictional threat against Norway via wireless traffic and visual deception. Fortitude North played on German, and particularly Adolf Hitler's, belief that Norway was a <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> for the Allies (although they had earlier considered and rejected the option).|$|E
5|$|Calais was {{virtually}} razed {{to the ground}} during World War II. In May 1940, it was a <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> of the invading German forces and became {{the scene of a}} last-ditch defence—the Siege of Calais—which diverted a sizable amount of German forces for several days immediately prior to the Battle of Dunkirk. 3,000 British and 800 French troops, assisted by Royal Navy warships, held out from 22 to 27 May 1940 against the 10th Panzer Division. The town was flattened by artillery and precision dive bombing and only 30 of the 3800-strong defending force were evacuated before the town fell. This may have helped Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of Allied forces at Dunkirk, as 10th Panzer would have been involved on the Dunkirk perimeter had it not been busy at Calais. Between 26 May and 4 June 1940, some 330,000 Allied troops escaped from the Germans at Dunkirk.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Snow Hill tunnel re-opened and {{the former}} LCDR City Branch {{formed the basis of}} the new Thameslink route. Network Rail began a major upgrade of the route in 2009. A <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> of the Thameslink Programme was {{allowing}} more trains to travel between central London and Brighton, which was prevented by a bottleneck between London Bridge and Blackfriars on a viaduct through the historic Borough Market. Network Rail initially suggested widening the viaduct and demolishing part of the market, but the public backlash against this plan prompted Network Rail to consider permanently routing all Thameslink trains to/from Brighton via Herne Hill, avoiding London Bridge and the market. This would have required the grade separation of the two lines through Herne Hill, which would have been achieved by constructing a new viaduct immediately to the east of the existing viaduct and using a fly-over to connect {{the southern end of the}} new viaduct to the line between Tulse Hill and North Dulwich (taking the tracks over the Chatham Main Line and towards Tulse Hill). This proposal was rejected in 2004 because of its environmental impact on Herne Hill and the larger number of interchanges offered on the London Bridge route; the Borough Market viaduct was widened instead. From December 2008 to May 2012, Thameslink trains serving Herne Hill did not run most weekends or after 22:30 every week-night because of construction work on the Thameslink route through central London as part of the Thameslink Programme.|$|E

5|$|Thief {{takes place}} from a first-person {{perspective}} in a 3D environment, with the game's story taking place over {{a series of}} missions, in which the player character is able to perform various actions such as leaning, crouching, swimming, climbing, running and fighting, amongst other abilities. Levels are largely unscripted, and allow for emergent gameplay; while non-player characters (NPCs) may either remain stationary or walk about on a patrol route, players {{have the freedom to}} choose how to get around them and the obstacles in a level's environments in order to complete specific tasks, such as getting through a locked door. In each level, the player is given a set of objectives to complete, such as stealing a specific object, which they must complete in order to progress to the next level; the player can choose to play on one of three difficulty settings before starting a level, which they can change between missions, with higher difficulties adding additional objectives such as not killing human NPCs or stealing a certain amount of loot from the amount available in a level, changing the amount of health the player character has, and changing how sensitive a NPC is to their environment. In some missions, players may find objectives being changed or new ones being added, due to certain circumstances they encounter, while failing a <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> or dying, will fail a level, forcing a player to either replay it or load up a previous save.|$|E

25|$|In early November, US {{forces had}} landed around Cape Torokina and {{established}} a beachhead, as part of Allied efforts to advance towards the main Japanese base around Rabaul, the isolation and reduction {{of which was a}} <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> of Operation Cartwheel. Facing the American beachhead at Cape Torokina were troops of the Japanese 17th Army, commanded by General Harukichi Hyakutake, the main elements of which were drawn from Lieutenant General Masatane Kanda's 6th Division. In response, the Japanese attempted a counter landing at Koromokina Lagoon, and began moving reinforcements north from southern Bougainville.|$|E

Situated south-east of New Britain, Bougainville offered the Allies another step in their advance towards the main Japanese base that had been established around Rabaul, the reduction and isolation of which was a <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> of the Allied Operation Cartwheel. Seizure of Bougainville offered the Allies forward airfields from which to launch attacks against Rabaul, as well as anchorages around Empress Augusta Bay and Soraken, which could be utilised for Allied shipping.|$|E

25|$|When McLane entered Jackson’s cabinet he {{immediately}} assumed {{a position of}} leadership. Articulate, persuasive and energetic, he had mastered the issues under debate and was confident he could lead {{the others in the}} administration, including the President. Recognizing there was a difference of opinion with Jackson over the Bank, he sought to work out a plan with the bank president, Nicholas Biddle, to provide for the upcoming renewal of the bank’s charter in return for the accomplishment of a <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> of the President, the retirement of the national debt. On December 7, 1831 he proposed a sweeping plan to accomplish that and more. Acclaimed for its Hamiltonian creativity, McLane had taken the initiative on the administration’s agenda, and was acting very much in the role of a Prime Minister. With enough time he was certain Jackson would soften his position and consent to the approach.|$|E
25|$|In Battlefield 2, {{players are}} divided into two {{opposing}} teams (which factions they represent is dependent upon the map). The <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> in Battlefield 2 {{is to reduce the}} opposing teams tickets. Tickets represent an army's ability to reinforce their position on the battlefield; each team has only a limited supply of tickets, and each casualty on the battlefield reduces the number of available tickets. Control points represent key points on the map, and are represented by flags. Control points are Battlefield 2s spawn points, and one team possessing a significant majority of the control points causes the other teams tickets to gradually decrease, regardless of casualties. A round ends when one team's tickets gone, the round's timer ends, or if at any point a team holds no control points, and has no soldiers alive on the battlefield (meaning they are not present in any way on the battlefield).|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of the {{invasion}} force the Japanese garrison on Tarakan and Borneo was subjected to intensive air and naval attacks from 12 April to 29 April. The RAAF and USAAF also mounted air attacks against Japanese bases in China, French Indochina and the NEI to suppress Japanese air units throughout the region. These attacks destroyed all Japanese aircraft in the Tarakan area. The aerial bombing of Tarakan increased in intensity five days before the landing. These attacks were focused on the areas adjoining the planned landing beaches at Lingkas and sought to neutralise the Japanese defences in these areas. The oil storage tanks at Lingkas were a <b>key</b> <b>objective</b> as it was feared that the oil in these tanks could be ignited and used against Allied troops. These bombardments forced much of Tarakan's civilian population to flee inland. At least 100 civilians were killed or wounded.|$|E
