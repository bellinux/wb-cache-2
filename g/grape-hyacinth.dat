5000|$|Scilla litardierei (syn. S. amethystina, S. pratensis, S. albanica, S. italica, S. nutans, Chouardia litardierrei) the Amethyst Meadow Squill (or Dalmatian Scilla) is a bulbous perennial, {{grown for}} its blue <b>grape-hyacinth</b> like flowers, {{blooming}} in late spring, much {{later than the}} more popular Siberian squill and later than Muscari which it resembles. Originating in the western Balkans, hence Dalmatian Scilla, it was introduced to western Europe (England) in 1827. It {{has become much more}} easily available since 2004.|$|E
5000|$|Muscari armeniacum is a {{bulbous plant}} {{of the genus}} Muscari with basal, simple leaves and short, {{flowering}} stems. It {{is one of a}} number of species and genera known as grape hyacinth, in this case Armenian grape hyacinth or Garden <b>Grape-hyacinth.</b> The flowers are purple, blue (with a white fringe), white (var. [...] "Album") or pale pink (var [...] "Pink Sunrise") and the plants are usually 15 cm tall. M. armeniacum blooms in mid-Spring (April or May in the Northern Hemisphere) for 3-4 weeks. Some selections are fragrant. Established bulbs leaf in the autumn. M. armeniacum is widespread in the woods and meadows of the Eastern Mediterranean, from Greece and Turkey to the Caucasus.|$|E
40|$|This guide {{discusses}} the {{various aspects of}} forcing spring flowering bulbs, including planting, cold treatment, forcing, care, and forcing in water. Introduction Spring flowers can be a bright addition to any home. With just a little effort, many types of spring flowering bulbs can fill your home with flowers throughout the winter. Tulips, narcissus (daffodils), hyacinths, crocus, <b>grape-hyacinths,</b> scillas and other bulbs can be forced into midwinter bloom. The term forcing {{can be a bit}} misleading. There is little force involved, but rather the bulbs receive their cold treatment early and are allowed to bloom out of season. The term forcing will be used throughout this publication for clarity...|$|R
60|$|They clambered {{down the}} terraced ravines sometimes, {{a day or}} two later, to arid banks by a dry torrent's bed where Italian primroses really grew, {{interspersed}} with tall <b>grape-hyacinths,</b> and scented violets, and glossy cleft leaves of winter aconite. But even the primroses were not the same thing to Herminia as those she used to gather on the dewy slopes of the Redlands; they were so dry and dust-grimed, and the path by the torrent's side was so distasteful and unsavory. Bare white boughs of twisted fig-trees depressed her. Besides, these hills were steep, and Herminia felt the climbing. Nothing in city or suburbs attracted her soul. Etruscan Volumnii, each lolling in white travertine on the sculptured lid of his own sarcophagus urn, and all duly ranged in the twilight of their tomb at their spectral banquet, stirred her heart but feebly. St. Francis, Santa Chiara, fell flat on her English fancy. But as for Alan, he revelled all day long in his native element. He sketched every morning, among the huddled, strangled lanes; sketched churches and monasteries, and portals of palazzi; sketched mountains clear-cut in that pellucid air; till Herminia wondered how he could sit so long in the broiling sun or keen wind on those bare hillsides, or on broken brick parapets in those noisome byways. But your born sketcher is oblivious of all on earth save his chosen art; and Alan was essentially a painter in fibre, diverted by pure circumstance into a Chancery practice.|$|R
