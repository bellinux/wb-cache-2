2500|$|The {{title of}} the album comes from the lyrics to a then {{unreleased}} Swans song entitled [...] "Oxygen" [...] (which was later released on To Be Kind) that depicts Gira dying and ascending to Heaven and several reviewers have noted spiritual themes on the album. Tiny Mix Tapes sums up its review with, [...] "The real bravery is for an album whose title equates religion with suicide to end almost {{at the other end}} of the spectrum: 'Teach me please, to cease to resist,' Gira asks. 'May <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> way to the reason to come home/ May <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> way to the foot of your throne.'" [...] Gira's interest in spirituality developed with this album and his goal was to create music, [...] "to elevate, to make you levitate, almost like having it erase your body and lift you up to Heaven." ...|$|E

What is it, this one thing, {{and how do}} <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> way to it? Traces of this perfect thing appear in many guises – and {{everything}} that is unimportant falls away. Tintinnabulation is like this. Here I am alone with silence. I have discovered that it is enough when a single note is beautifully played. This one note, or a silent beat, or a moment of silence, comforts me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Writing for Artspeak, Cindy Richmond has {{described}} Campbell's {{work as a}} [...] "confirmation of Minimalism's continued vitality. Her monochrome paintings, site-specific installations and sculptures allow her to explore issues implicit to a stripped-down aesthetic and examine {{the context in which}} art is experienced." [...] However, Neil Campbell (no relation) of Emily Carr University of Art and Design has argued that while [...] "Arabella's paintings concern themselves with conceptual or formal strategies, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>my</b> main response is to the aesthetic character of the work. The surfaces of her monochromes are rendered carefully, step by step, through a reverential application of paint. It's that observance that affects me." [...] This, Neil Campbell argues, is intended on Arabella Campbell's part.|$|E
