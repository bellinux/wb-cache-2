40|$|The inter-related {{dynamics}} of <b>dual</b> <b>job-holding,</b> human capital and occupational choice between {{primary and secondary}} jobs are investigated, using a panel sample (1991 - 2005) of UK employees from the British Household Panel Survey (BHPS). A sequential profile of the working lives of employees is examined, investigating, first, the determinants of multiple job-holding, second, the factors affecting the occupational choice of a secondary job, third, the relationship between multiple-job holding and job mobility and, lastly, the spillover effects of multiple job-holding on occupational mobility between primary jobs. The evidence indicates that <b>dual</b> <b>job-holding</b> may facilitate job transition, as it may act as a stepping-stone towards new primary jobs, particularly self-employment. ...|$|E

This note examines {{some of the evidence}} regarding these differences, focusing on shifts in the regional pattern of employment and unemployment, especially for New England.; The recovery from the recent recession has been unusually weak or gradual, especially in terms of employment. Moreover, the recession displayed an industry pattern noticeably different from earlier recessions. Partly as a result, white collar workers suffered more unemployment than is usual in a recession, and job losers {{were more likely to have}} been terminated from their jobs rather than temporarily laid off. In New England, where the slowdown has been longer and deeper, labor markets appear to be responding to the downturn in an unprecedented way, with sizable declines in <b>dual</b> <b>job-holding</b> and an increase in self-employment. A key question is whether these apparent changes in the operation of the job market will be reversed as the recovery continues to unfold. Employment (Economic theory); New England...|$|E
