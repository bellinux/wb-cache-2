5|$|The <b>hymenium</b> has cystidia {{both on the}} gill {{edge and}} face (cheilo- and pleurocystidia respectively), which are slender and filament-like, {{typically}} measuring 40–65 by 8–10.5μm.|$|E
5|$|The white, porous <b>hymenium</b> has a {{thickness}} of 1–2mm and turns brown when bruised. Per millimeter, {{there are two}} to three square pores. When dried, the hymenium's color becomes pinkish-brown. The <b>hymenium</b> extends slightly down the stipe, and is sharply defined. Dried tissue smells similar to fenugreek. The morphology of the mycorrhiza {{has not yet been}} described; however, as with all other types of Boletopsis {{it is likely to be}} ectomycorrhizal.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic {{cells with}} an oily content (gloeocystidia) {{are found in}} the <b>hymenium.</b> In Russulaceae, these show a {{positive}} colour reaction when treated with sulfoaldehydes (sulfovanillin is mostly used). They are also present in the hyphal sheath of ectomycorrhizal roots colonised by Russulaceae.|$|E
5|$|Due {{partly to}} their ready {{availability}} and {{the ease with}} which they may be grown in the laboratory, C.micaceus and other coprinoid mushrooms were common subjects in cytological studies of the 19th and 20th centuries. The German botanist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link reported his observations {{of the structure of the}} <b>hymenium</b> (the fertile spore-bearing surface) in 1809, but misinterpreted what he had seen. Link thought that microscopic structures known today as basidia were thecae, comparable in form to the asci of the Ascomycetes, and that each theca contained four series of spores. His inaccurate drawings of the <b>hymenium</b> of C.micaceus were copied in subsequent mycological publications by other authors, and it was not until microscopy had advanced that mycologists were able to determine the true nature of the basidia, when nearly three decades later in 1837 Joseph-Henri Léveillé and August Corda independently published correct descriptions of the structure of the <b>hymenium.</b> In 1924, A. H. Reginald Buller published a comprehensive description and analysis of the processes of spore production and release in the third volume of his Researches on Fungi.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the spore shape, the species is readily identified {{with the use of}} a microscope because of its setae. Setae are a kind of unusual cystidia unique to the family Hymenochaetaceae, and, in P.ellipsoideus, are found in the <b>hymenium.</b> In shape, the setae are ventricose, with distinctive hooks on their tips. In colour, they are yellow-brown, and they have thick cell walls. They measure 20 to 30 by 10 to 14μm. Neither more standard cystidia nor cystidioles (underdeveloped cystidia) can be found in the species, but there are a number of rhomboid crystals throughout the <b>hymenium</b> and the flesh.|$|E
5|$|Multifurca: agaricoid; caps zonate (also {{visible in}} cut through trama); gills {{regularly}} forked; only M. furcata exuding latex; spore print orange; spores very small; microscopical trama and <b>hymenium</b> features very variable.|$|E
5|$|The spores {{are seen}} ochre-brown in mass, but pale yellow when viewed {{with a light}} microscope. They are {{fusiform}} (tapered at each end), sized 8–10.5 by 3–4.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells of the <b>hymenium)</b> are four-spored.|$|E
5|$|Cantharellus lateritius, {{commonly}} known as the smooth chanterelle, is a species of edible fungus in the Cantharellaceae family of mushrooms. A ectomycorrhizal species, it is found in Asia, Africa, and North America. The species has a complex taxonomic history, and has undergone several name changes since its first description by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz in 1822. The fruit bodies of the fungus are brightly colored yellow to orange, and usually highly conspicuous against the soil in which they are found. At maturity, the mushroom resembles a filled funnel with the spore-bearing surface along the sloping outer sides. The texture of the fertile undersurface (<b>hymenium)</b> of the caps is a distinguishing characteristic of the species: unlike the well-known golden chanterelle, the <b>hymenium</b> of C.lateritius is much smoother. Chemical analysis has revealed the presence of several carotenoid compounds in the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|In 1914, Zeller {{published}} {{a study of}} the development of the mushroom, made possible by the prolific fruiting of the fungus in Seattle in the fall of 1912. Development was studied by examining thin sections of tissues in different stages of development, and the differentiation of tissues and structures followed by using histological stains. The growth form of Xerocomellus zelleri is called gymnocarpic, meaning that the <b>hymenium</b> appears and develops to maturity in an exposed state, not enclosed by any protective membrane. In this type of development, the cap is formed from hyphae {{at the top of the}} stem and subsequently expands by growth along the margins; the <b>hymenium</b> forms later beneath the cap in a direction away from the center.|$|E
5|$|The apothecium—a {{specialized}} structure {{important in}} sexual reproduction in the ascomycetes—is a cup-shaped fruit {{body that is}} often macroscopic and holds the <b>hymenium,</b> a layer of tissue containing the spore-bearing cells. The fruit bodies of the basidiomycetes (basidiocarps) and some ascomycetes can sometimes grow very large, and many are well known as mushrooms.|$|E
5|$|The colour of the {{spore print}} is brownish, with pink, reddish, or rosy tints. Spores are {{somewhat}} fuse-shaped, smooth, and measure 11–17 by 3–5µm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 18–25.6 by 7.0–10.2µm. Cystidia {{on the walls}} of the tubes (pleurocystidia) are fuse-shaped with a central swelling, thin-walled, and have granular contents. They possess sharp to tapered tips, and have overall dimensions of 36–44 by 8.0–11.0µm. On the pore edges, the cheilocystidia are similar in shape to the pleurocystidia, measuring 24.8–44.0 by 7.3–11.0µm. The <b>hymenium</b> of Smith and Thiers's variety uliginosus, when mounted in Melzer's reagent, shows reddish globules of pigment measuring 2–8µm that appear in the hyphae and throughout the <b>hymenium,</b> and a large (8–12µm) globule in the pleurocystidia.|$|E
5|$|The spores are , amyloid (meaning {{they turn}} bluish-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent), and measure 7–9 by 4–5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing {{cells in the}} <b>hymenium)</b> are 30–35 by 7–8μm, and four-spored. The cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill edge) are {{embedded}} in the <b>hymenium</b> and inconspicuous, measuring 20–28 by 6–12μm. They are irregular in form; some have short rodlike projections on the upper part, others have irregular branched finger-like protuberances, while others have wavy walls and an elongated contorted apex. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face) in Mycena maculata. The gill tissue is hyaline or very faintly vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The cap tissue has a thin , and the region directly under it is made of hyphae with only slightly enlarged cells, while the remainder is filamentous, and stains yellowish to slightly vinaceous-brown in iodine. The mycelium of M.maculata is bioluminescent; this property has not been reported for the fruit bodies.|$|E
5|$|The spores are smooth, spindle-shaped, {{and measure}} 13.5–19.8 by 5.0–7.2µm—rather large for {{a member of}} the Boletaceae. Grayish-yellow or greenish yellow when mounted in a dilute {{potassium}} hydroxide, they are dextrinoid (yellowish- or reddish-brown) when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the <b>hymenium)</b> are club-shaped, hyaline (translucent), four-spored, and measure 28.8–42.3 by 7.2–11.7µm. The <b>hymenium</b> contains basidioles (immature or aborted basidia), which are club-shaped and measure 20.7–35.1 by 7.2–9.0µm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia {{on the surface of the}} tubes) range in shape from somewhat spindle-shaped to cylindrical, and are hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled, with dimensions of 41.4–61.2 by 7.2–10.8µm. Cystidia on the edges of the pores (cheilocystidia) are 31.5–49.5 by 7.2–13.5µm, spindle-shaped to centrally swollen, hyaline, smooth, and thin-walled. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|With the {{exception}} of A.laevigatum, all species have a thin separating layer, the cortex, between the <b>hymenium</b> and the tomentum. A cortex is also present on many Stereum fungi (on a broader front) and serves to bend up the fruit body. As this cortex is missing on A.laevigatum, its fruit body lies flat on the bark.|$|E
5|$|Amanita rubrovolvata {{produces}} a white to cream-colored spore print. The spores are spherical or nearly so, and typically measure 7.5–9.0 by 7.0–8.5µm. They are inamyloid, {{meaning that they}} will not absorb iodine stain from Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells in the <b>hymenium)</b> are club-shaped, four-spored (rarely two-spored), and measure 25–44 by 10–14µm. The sterigmata (slender extensions at the basidial tips that attach to the spores) are 3–4µm long, and clamps are not found on the bases of basidia.|$|E
5|$|Exipulum is a {{term used}} to refer to the tissue or tissues {{containing}} the <b>hymenium</b> of an ascomycete fruit body. The ectal excipulum (outer tissue layer) is thin (20–30µm thickness), made of a tissue type known as texura porrecta, consisting of more or less parallel hyphae all in one direction, with wide lumina and non-thickened walls. The medullary exipulum (middle tissue layer) is thick (200–600µm) and made of textura intricata, a tissue layer made of irregularly interwoven hyphae with distinct spaces between the hyphae. The asci (filamentous structures in which the ascospores develop) are cylindrical with gradually tapering bases, eight-spored, and measure 240–280 by 12–15µm. The ascospores have ellipsoidal to roughly cylindrical shapes, usually with blunt ends, and measure 19–22 by 10–12µm. They have smooth surfaces and usually contain two large oil drops. The paraphyses (sterile, filamentous hyphae present in the <b>hymenium)</b> are cylindrical, 2–3µm thick, barely enlarged at their apices, straight, and mostly unbranched above. They may sometimes anastomose, but do not form a conspicuous network. The paraphyses contain numerous red granules.|$|E
5|$|In 1906, Charles Horton Peck {{described}} the variety magna from material collected in North Elba, New York. Peck {{explained that the}} variety differed from the typical species in several ways: var. magna grew among fallen leaves under balsam fir trees, or among mosses on the ground, not on buried wood; it lacked a stem, and was instead broad and rounded underneath; its <b>hymenium</b> was more yellow-brown then the nominate variety; and, its spore were slightly longer.|$|E
5|$|In mass, {{the spores}} are whitish. The spores are elliptical, smooth, hyaline, devoid of oil {{droplets}} (eguttulate), and have dimensions of 13–18 by 7–9µm. They are thin walled and germinate and grow rapidly in vitro {{in the absence}} of external stimuli. The asci are 190–225 by 9–10µm. The paraphyses are slightly club-shaped, unbranched, and have irregular orange-brown granules, with tips up to 5µm wide, and are not forked or lobed. The hypothecium, the layer of cells below the <b>hymenium,</b> is made of densely packed, small irregular cells.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the peridium to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true <b>hymenium.</b> In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are long}} and cylindrical, and taper into a short stem-like base; they measure 300–375 by 14–16µm. Although in most Pezizales all of the ascospores are formed {{simultaneously}} through delimitation by an inner and outer membrane, in S.coccinea the ascospores located in the basal parts of the ascus develop faster. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae present in the <b>hymenium)</b> are about 3µm wide (and only slightly thickened at the apex), and contain red pigment granules.|$|E
5|$|The asci {{are roughly}} {{cylindrical}} {{with a long}} stem-like base; the entire ascus is often as long as 300–325µm and about 15µm in diameter at the thickest point. The spores are round, smooth, translucent (hyaline), and have diameters of about 12–14µm. They are filled with many small oil droplets. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphae in the <b>hymenium)</b> are enlarged at their tips and filled with brown colored matter, about 4µm thick.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hymenium</b> is {{developed}} on the under (outer) {{side of the}} fruit body. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) consist of a globular part (the hypobasidia) to which inflated or elongated epibasidia are attached. In Guepinia, the hypobasidia are egg-shaped to , measuring 12–16 by 9–12 μm, and attached to fibril-like epibasidia that are 20–45 by 3–4μm. The spore deposit is white, while the spores are 9–11 by 5–6μm, hyaline (translucent), cylindrical to elongated ellipsoid in shape, and have a large oil drop.|$|E
5|$|The {{spore print}} is white. Spores are {{elliptic}} (or narrowly so), and measure 8–12 by 4.8–6.2µm. There are clamp connections {{present in the}} hyphae. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored, club-shaped, and measure 23–30 by 8–10µm. The <b>hymenium</b> lacks cystidia. The cap flesh comprises homogenous, interwoven hyphae that are 3–5µm in diameter, while the cap cuticle is a 200–300-micrometer thick layer of interwoven, gelatinous hyphae up to 4µm in diameter.|$|E
5|$|The spores are {{spindle-shaped}} or elliptical, thick-walled, smooth, {{and have}} dimensions of 13–16 by 5.5–6.5μm. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells, are club-shaped (clavate), attached to 1 to 4 spores, and have dimensions of 35–90 by 9–12μm. The cystidia (sterile, non-spore-bearing cells found interspersed among the basidia) in the <b>hymenium</b> have dimensions of 33–60 by 8–12μm. Clamp connections are absent in the hyphae of B.pulcherrimus.|$|E
5|$|Viewed with a microscope, {{the wall}} of the {{apothecium}} is made of three tissue layers of roughly equal thickness. The first layer of tissue is black, leathery and compact, and covered with a fine layer of brownish-black hairs (a tomentum); the second layer consists of loosely interlaced brown hyphae suspended in a gelatinous matrix. The third layer is the fertile, spore-bearing surface, the brownish-black <b>hymenium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Details of {{the fruit}} bodies' appearance, color in particular, are {{somewhat}} variable and dependent on growing conditions. For example, specimens growing on logs in oak and hickory forests in the spring {{tend to have more}} yellowish-white, depressed caps than those found in the same location in autumn, which are light yellow brown and more convex in shape. The fruit body development of M.rotula is hemiangiocarpous, with an <b>hymenium</b> that is only partially enclosed by basidiocarp tissues. Robert Kühner showed that a -like tissue covers the young gills before the expanding cap breaks away from the stem. In unfavorable weather conditions, however, the mushrooms may fail to develop normally and instead produce semi-gasteroid basidiocarps.|$|E
5|$|Hydnellum peckiis cells (the hyphae) {{also present}} various {{characters}} useful for its characterization. The hyphae {{that form the}} cap are hyaline (translucent), smooth, thin-walled, and 3–4µm thick. They collapse when dry, but may be readily revived with a weak (2%) solution of potassium hydroxide. Those in the cap form an intricate tangle with a tendency to run longitudinally. They are divided into cellular compartments (septa) and have clamp connections—short branches connecting one cell to the previous cell to allow passage of the products of nuclear division. The basidia, the spore-bearing cells in the <b>hymenium,</b> are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 35–40 by 4.7–6µm.|$|E
5|$|In ascomycetes, dikaryotic hyphae of the <b>hymenium</b> (the spore-bearing tissue layer) form a {{characteristic}} hook at the hyphal septum. During cell division, {{formation of the}} hook ensures proper distribution of the newly divided nuclei into the apical and basal hyphal compartments. An ascus (plural asci) is then formed, in which karyogamy (nuclear fusion) occurs. Asci are embedded in an ascocarp, or fruiting body. Karyogamy in the asci is followed immediately by meiosis {{and the production of}} ascospores. After dispersal, the ascospores may germinate and form a new haploid mycelium.|$|E
5|$|Mushrooms {{produce a}} spore print with a color ranging from pinkish to salmon. Spores are elliptical, smooth, and measure 6.5–10 by 4.5–6.5μm. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club-shaped, four-spored, and measure 19–43 by 6–11μm. Pleurocystidia (cystidia that {{occur on the}} gill face) are usually spindle shaped, but have a widely {{variable}} morphology; they are abundant in the <b>hymenium,</b> and have dimensions of 26–122 by 8–57μm. The cheilocystidia (on the gill edge) are similar in morphology and abundance, some may feature knobs held {{at the end of}} slender projections up to 20μm long; dimensions are in the range of 26 and 144μm long by 8–46μm wide. Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae of V.bombycina.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Dennis McCabe {{studied the}} {{development}} of the fruit body using specimens grown in pure culture. Starting out as a hyphal tuft, the fungus grows into a cup shape before eventually closing in completely to create the spherical structure of the mature fruit body. When the fungus is in the cup stage, the exposed <b>hymenium</b> is immature; typically, spores develop after the fruit body is fully closed. In some cases, the fruit body stops developing at the cup stage while the <b>hymenium</b> continues to mature. This results in a cup-shaped fungus with an exposed layer of basidia bearing normal and mature spores. Limnoperdon incarnatum is a structurally simple fungus, and relatively easy to grow in culture, suggesting it may have potential as a model organism for fruit body development in general. Under the experimental conditions used, fruit bodies matured to produce spores about 72 hours after the fungus started growing. The aborted cups resemble the sporocarps of the cyphelloid fungi, but can be distinguished by their orthotrophic spore attachment and the lack of ballistospory (forceful spore discharge). McCabe and Escobar later suggested that the fungus may have evolved the loss of ballistospory by being compensated with the cup-shaped fruit body closing at maturity. Halocyphina villosa is another small cup-shaped Basidiomycete fungus that has adapted to a marine environment; in contrast to L.incarnatum, however, it starts out with a closed fruit body that later opens up to become cup-shaped.|$|E
5|$|The Amylostereaceae {{possess a}} dimitic trama, meaning {{that there are}} in its mycelia two kinds of hyphae. The first type is {{brownish}} skeletal hyphae, which provide stability to the fruit body. These hyphae run parallel to the bark and often have hairpin-like turns, so that the loops form thick-walled, cystidium-like structures, the so-called pseudocystidia. The second type is generative hyphae. They are translucent (hyaline) and serve to promote {{the growth of the}} fungus. Genuine cystidia arise in the <b>hymenium</b> and the layer directly below, the subhymenium. Both pseudocystidia and cystidia are encrusted, meaning that they feature crystal-like structures on the top.|$|E
5|$|The asci are 400–500 by 12–14µm, cylindrical, and operculate. The ascospores are {{elliptical}} to cylindrical with rounded ends, uniseriate, hyaline, {{and measure}} 26–40 by 10–12µm. They contain two large oil drops at either end; the oil drops are useful taxonomic characters {{that may be}} used to help distinguish S.dudleyi from some other Sarcoscypha species. The spores are covered with a sheath of mucilage, which typically causes the eight spores of the ascus to be ejected together. The paraphyses (sterile filamentous hyphal end cells in the <b>hymenium)</b> are slender, slightly enlarged above, and contain numerous red granules. The granules contain carotenoid pigments such as plectaniaxanthine or beta carotene, and give the fruit body its color.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies are}} {{typically}} found growing in large numbers, sometimes in clumps, though solitary specimens are occasionally encountered. Several bodies can be connected at their bases, or younger bodies can {{grow out of}} the bases of older ones. The youngest fruit bodies are conical in shape. When the body reaches around 2mm in length, {{the tip of the}} cone begins to expand, forming the head. This is the stage at which the <b>hymenium</b> becomes differentiated {{from the rest of the}} body, and the bodies quickly reach their mature form, maturing only through growth after that point. Fruit bodies can be infected by the mould Hypomyces leotiarum.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing <b>hymenium</b> during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit body}} {{formation}} of L.torminosus is pileostipitocarpic. In {{this type of}} development, the <b>hymenium</b> forms early {{on the underside of}} the cap and upper stem of the mushroom primordium. As the cap enlarges, the margin, made of flaring filamentous hyphae that grow outward and downward, tends to curve inward, eventually forming a flap of tissue roughly parallel to the stem surface. As further development takes place, these hyphae make contact with and adhere to the hymenial surface of the stem, covering basidia and macrocystidia (very long cystidia) already present. The junction between the two tissues produces a cavity that provides some temporary protection to the basidia, although they are already fertile when the cap margin starts to grow.|$|E
5|$|The fruitbodies (ascocarps) of Geopyxis carbonaris are cup shaped, 1–2cm wide, {{and have}} fringed whitish margins. The inner spore-bearing {{surface of the}} cup, the <b>hymenium,</b> is brick red and smooth, while the {{exterior}} surface is a dull yellow, and may be either smooth or have blister-like spots (pustules). The stipe is small (1–1.5mm long and 1–2mm wide), whitish in color, and expands abruptly into the cup. The brownish flesh of the fungus is thin and brittle. It {{does not have any}} distinctive taste, but has an unpleasant smell when crushed in water. The edibility of the fungus is not known, but the fruitbodies are insubstantial and unlikely to be harvested for eating.|$|E
