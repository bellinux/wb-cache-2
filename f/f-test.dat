In this study, we developed an <b>F-T</b> assimilation algorithm for the NASA Goddard Earth Observing System, version 5 (GEOS- 5) modeling and assimilation framework. The algorithm includes a newly developed observation operator that diagnoses the landscape <b>F-T</b> state in the GEOS- 5 Catchment land surface model. The <b>F-T</b> analysis is a rule-based approach that adjusts Catchment model state variables in response to binary <b>F-T</b> observations, while also considering forecast and observation errors. A regional observing system simulation experiment was conducted using synthetically generated <b>F-T</b> observations. The assimilation of perfect (error-free) <b>F-T</b> observations reduced the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of surface temperature and soil temperature by 0. 206 C and 0. 061 C, respectively, when compared to model estimates (equivalent to a relative RMSE reduction of 6. 7 percent and 3. 1 percent, respectively). For a maximum classification error (CEmax) of 10 percent in the synthetic <b>F-T</b> observations, the <b>F-T</b> assimilation reduced the RMSE of surface temperature and soil temperature by 0. 178 C and 0. 036 C, respectively. For CEmax= 20 percent, the <b>F-T</b> assimilation still reduces the RMSE of model surface temperature estimates by 0. 149 C but yields no improvement over the model soil temperature estimates.

40|$|Incorporation of probe {{molecules}} {{has been}} widely used in elucidation of the mechanism of the Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> reaction. In this study, we used acetylenic molecules, including 1 -hexyne, 2 -hexyne, 4 -phenyl- 1 -butyne, and 1 -phenyl- 1 -propyne as well as acetylene as probes with cobalt and iron catalysts. Experiments were carried out in a tubular microreactor of 3 / 8 inch diameter. Long chain alkynes were added via a saturator or a syringe pump. Acetylene was introduced from a cylinder containing carbon monoxide and hydrogen plus 1 % of acetylene. We found that acetylenic compounds can initiate the <b>F-T</b> synthesis at temperatures more than 100 oC lower than those at which normal <b>F-T</b> reactions are carried out. Since products obtained from linear alkyne-initiated <b>F-T</b> and those from normal <b>F-T</b> synthesis are indistinguishable, we used phenyl-substituted acetylenes as probes to distinguish the alkyne initiated products from normal <b>F-T</b> products. At low temperatures, only alkyne-initiated <b>F-T</b> reactions take place; at normal <b>F-T</b> temperatures, both alkyne initiated reactions and normal initiated <b>F-T</b> reactions occur. Although the degree of incorporation of internal alkynes is much {{less than that of}} the terminal alkynes, they can also initiate <b>F-T</b> chain growth to form mostly branched products. Under the same reaction conditions, internal olefins have little effect on the <b>F-T</b> reaction. When an acetylenic probe molecule is added to cobalt catalyzed <b>F-T</b> reactions, aldehydes or alcohols with one carbon more than the added probe molecule are the only oxygenates formed, perhaps by a hydroformylation type of reaction. Incorporation of alkynes (with carbon number n) on iron catalysts increased the rate of formation of Cn+ 1 + oxygenates, via Anderson-Schulz-Flory distribution. The <b>F-T</b> synthesis is a complex process in which a large number of hydrocarbon and oxygenated species are present on the catalyst surface. The nature of these adsorbates and how they react differ as reaction conditions {{and the nature of the}} catalyst changes. This work, combined with results of experiments on incorporation of ethylene, lends credence to the postulation that unsaturated two-carbon entity, possibly vinylidenes or ethylidynes, may be involved in initiation of the <b>F-T</b> synthesis...|$|R

As for the previous rheologies, the first analyses used a single rheological value for the whole run-out path (Table  2 : <b>F-t</b> 1 with δ[*]=[*] 10 °, <b>F-t</b> 2 with δ[*]=[*] 8 °, <b>F-t</b> 3 with δ[*]=[*] 7 °).

40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> {{catalytic}} conversion {{process can be}} used to synthesize diesel fuels from a variety of feedstocks, including coal, natural gas and biomass. Synthetic diesel fuels can have very low sulfur and aromatic content, and excellent autoignition characteristics. Moreover, Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuels may also be economically competitive with California B- diesel fuel if produced in large volumes. overview of Fischer-Tropsch diesel fuel production and engine emissions testing is presented. Previous engine laboratory tests indicate that <b>F-T</b> diesel is a promising alternative fuel because it can be used in unmodified diesel engines, and substantial exhaust emissions reductions can be realized. The authors have performed preliminary tests to assess the real-world performance of <b>F-T</b> diesel fuels in heavy-duty trucks.

40|$|The {{objective}} of the DOE-NETL Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> Production and Demonstration Program was to produce and evaluate <b>F-T</b> fuel derived from domestic natural gas. The project had two primary phases: (1) fuel production of ultra-clean diesel transportation fuels from domestic fossil resources; and (2) demonstration and performance testing of these fuels in engines. The project also included a well-to-wheels economic analysis and a feasibility study of small-footprint <b>F-T</b> plants (SFPs) for remote locations such as rural Alaska. During the fuel production phase, ICRC partnered and cost-shared with Syntroleum Corporation to complete the mechanical design, construction, and operation of a modular SFP that converts natural gas, via <b>F-T</b> and hydro-processing reactions, into hydrogensaturated diesel fuel. Construction of the Tulsa, Oklahoma plant started in August 2002 and culminated {{in the production of}} over 100, 000 gallons of <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel (S- 2) through 2004, specifically for this project. That fuel formed the basis of extensive demonstrations and evaluations that followed. The ultra-clean <b>F-T</b> fuels produced had virtually no sulfur (less than 1 ppm) and were of the highest quality in terms of ignition quality, saturation content, backend volatility, etc. Lubricity concerns were investigated to verify that commercially available lubricity additive treatment would be adequate to protect fuel injection system components. In the fuel demonstration and testing phase, two separate bus fleets were utilized. The Washington DC Metropolitan Area Transit Authority (WMATA) and Denali National Park bus fleets were used because they represented nearly opposite ends of several spectra, including: climate, topography, engine load factor, mean distance between stops, and composition of normally used conventional diesel fuel. Fuel evaluations in addition to bus fleet demonstrations included: bus fleet emission measurements; <b>F-T</b> fuel cold weather performance; controlled engine dynamometer lab evaluation; cold-start test-cell evaluations; overall feasibility, economics, and efficiency of SFP fuel production; and an economic analysis. Two unexpected issues that arose during the project were further studied and resolved: variations in NOx emissions were accounted for and fuel-injection nozzle fouling issues were traced to the non-combustible (ash) content of the engine oil, not the <b>F-T</b> fuel. The <b>F-T</b> fuel domestically produced and evaluated in this effort appears to be a good replacement candidate for petroleum-based transportation fuels. However, in order for domestic <b>F-T</b> fuels to become a viable cost-comparable alternative to petroleum fuels, the <b>F-T</b> fuels will need to be produced from abundant U.

Alternatively, we could carry out pairwise tests among the treatments (for instance, in the medical trial example with four treatments we could carry out six tests among pairs of treatments). The advantage of the ANOVA <b>F-test</b> is that we do not need to pre-specify which treatments are to be compared, and we do not need to adjust for making multiple comparisons.

The chemistry of the <b>F-T</b> consists of the kinetics, catalyst performance, activation process and selectivities.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} of this project is the three phase development of an Early Entrance Coproduction Plant (EECP) which uses petroleum coke to produce at least one product from {{at least two of}} the following three categories: (1) electric power (or heat), (2) fuels, and (3) chemicals using ChevronTexaco's proprietary gasification technology. The objective of Phase I is to determine the feasibility and define the concept for the EECP located at a specific site; develop a Research, Development, and Testing (RD&T) Plan to mitigate technical risks and barriers; and prepare a Preliminary Project Financing Plan. The objective of Phase II is to implement the work as outlined in the Phase I RD&T Plan to enhance the development and commercial acceptance of coproduction technology. The objective of Phase III is to develop an engineering design package and a financing and testing plan for an EECP located at a specific site. The project's intended result is to provide the necessary technical, economic, and environmental information needed by industry to move the EECP forward to detailed design, construction, and operation. The partners in this project are Texaco Energy Systems LLC or TES (a subsidiary of ChevronTexaco), General Electric (GE), Praxair, and Kellogg Brown & Root (KBR) in addition to the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE). TES is providing gasification technology and Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> technology developed by Rentech, GE is providing combustion turbine technology, Praxair is providing air separation technology, and KBR is providing engineering. Each of the EECP subsystems was assessed for technical risks and barriers. A plan was developed to mitigate the identified risks (Phase II RD&T Plan, October 2000). Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 identified as potential technical risks to the EECP the fuel/engine performance and emissions of the <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel products. Hydrotreating the neat <b>F-T</b> diesel product reduces potentially reactive olefins, oxygenates, and acids levels and alleviates corrosion and fuel stability concerns. Future coproduction plants can maximize valuable transportation diesel by hydrocracking the <b>F-T</b> Synthesis wax product to diesel and naphtha. The upgraded neat <b>F-T</b> diesel, hydrotreater <b>F-T</b> diesel, and hydrocracker <b>F-T</b> diesel products would be final blending components in transportation diesel fuel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully carried out fuel lubricity property testing, fuel response to lubricity additives, and hot-start transient emission tests on a neat <b>F-T</b> diesel product, a hydrocracker <b>F-T</b> diesel product, a blend of hydrotreater and hydrocracker <b>F-T</b> diesel products, and a Tier II California Air Resources Board (CARB) -like diesel reference fuel. Only the neat <b>F-T</b> diesel passed lubricity inspection without additive while the remaining three fuel candidates passed with conventional additive treatment. Hot-start transient emission tests were conducted on the four fuels in accordance with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Federal Test Procedure (FTP) specified in Code of Federal Regulations, Title 40, Part 86, and Subpart N on a rebuilt 1991 Detroit Diesel Corporation Series 60 heavy-duty diesel engine. Neat <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel reduced oxides of nitrogen (NO{sub x}), total particulate (PM), hydrocarbons (HC), carbon monoxide (CO), and the Soluble Organic Fraction (SOF) by 4. 5 %, 31 %, 50 %, 29 %, and 35 %, respectively, compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. The hydrocracker <b>F-T</b> diesel product and a blend of hydrocracker and hydrotreater <b>F-T</b> diesel products also reduced NO{sub x}, PM, HC, CO and SOF by 13 %, 16 % to 17 %, 38 % to 63 %, 17 % to 21 % and 21 % to 39 % compared to the Tier II CARB-like diesel. The fuel/engine performance and emissions of the three <b>F-T</b> diesel fuels exceed the performance of a Tier II CARB-like diesel. Phase II RD&T Task 2. 6 successfully met the lubricity property testing and <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel hot-start transient emissions test objectives. The results of the testing help mitigate potential economic risks on obtaining a premium price for the <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel in the marketplace.

40|$|Alternative fuels for Diesel engines include ester-based fuels (derived {{from sources}} such as rapeseed, {{soybeans}} and palm oil), dimethyl ether, and various synthetic fuels. Use of these fuels could contribute to a cleaner environment, reduce global warming and improve the human health by reducing levels of harmful emissions. One such fuel is Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> fuel, a synthetic fuel that can be produced from coal, natural gas or biomass, the properties of which heavily depend on the catalyst used in its production. Various published {{studies have shown that}} use of <b>F-T</b> fuels could reduce emissions of soot, NOx, HC and CO, to varying degrees, since they have a number of desirable properties, including low sulfur and aromatic contents, high cetane numbers and low density. To further explore the performance of <b>F-T</b> fuels, and the emissions generated when they are used, engine tests were performed at Chalmers in both HCCI and conventional Diesel combustion modes. The engine used in the investigations was a single cylinder, 0. 5 liter, research engine, and the performance of two <b>F-T</b> Diesel fuels derived from natural gas, produced by Statoil in Trondheim, was compared with that of two conventional Diesel fuels (Swedish low sulfur Diesel and European EN 590 Diesel). In HCCI combustion mode the soot emissions were too low for meaningful comparison between the fuels. However, HC and NOx emissions were lower when using the <b>F-T</b> fuels. There were no significant between-fuel differences in emissions of CO and CO 2, or fuel consumption. In HCCI combustion mode, the combustion was phased by using exhaust gas recirculation (EGR), thus there were no between-fuel differences in ignition delay, despite the early injection (which is a key feature of HCCI combustion). However, higher levels of EGR were needed for the <b>F-T</b> fuels than for the standard Diesel fuels, which reduced the thermal efficiency of the engine. In conventional Diesel combustion mode the soot emissions were markedly lower (by up to 30 percent) when using the <b>F-T</b> fuels than when using the already clean Swedish low-sulfur Diesel. Reductions were also found in HC and CO emissions, while CO 2 and fuel consumption values obtained with the different fuels were similar. The high cetane number of the <b>F-T</b> fuels resulted in shorter ignition delays for the pilot injections. A challenge that had to be met before widespread use of <b>F-T</b> fuels could be economically viable was to minimize their production costs. However, these costs have fallen sharply, through a combination of intense research efforts and the construction of <b>F-T</b> plants with high production capacities, and they are now competitive with oil from fossil sources, so long as the price of the latter is higher than $ 25 /barrel. The possibilities of producing Fischer-Tropsch fuels from several feed-stocks and using existing engines without modifications are major advantages with <b>F-T</b> fuels. Moreover, <b>F-T</b> fuels can be blended in any proportions with petroleum-based Diesel, and existing refueling and maintenance infrastructure can be used for vehicles running on them.

Iron-based (Fe) catalysts are preferred catalysts for <b>F-T</b> when using low CO/H{sub 2 } ratio synthesis gases derived from modern coal gasifiers. This is because in addition to reasonable <b>F-T</b> activity, the <b>F-T</b> catalysts also possess high water gas shift (WGS) activity. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{reported}} that Fischer Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> diesel fuel is a high quality fuel, and therefore it has received attention as a low emission alternative fuel. Having low aromatic compounds, high cetane rating and almost zero sulfur content, the <b>F-T</b> diesel fuel shows advantages over conventional diesel fuel. However, in order to generalize such deductions and to fill the confirmation gaps, further investigation and combustion analysis have to be conducted. The aim of this investigation was to reveal and analyze the effects of the Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> fuels on a research diesel engine performance. Since the engine performance is closely related to in-cylinder processes, a detailed thermodynamic analysis is performed by Burst to File high frequency sampling code and by the Dragon software, revealing the real thermochemistry history. This program has been tested on thousands of measured points and is today regularly used while analyzing test results from the single cylinder diesel engine. Experimental results have shown that <b>F-T</b> fuels have a remarkable impact not only on the emissions levels, but also on other energetic parameters of the engine. Heat release analysis (evaluated according to the “Dragon” software program and acquisition from “Burst to File” PC based sampling system) have shown that ignition delay, cylinder peak pressure, heat release gradient and indicated efficiency are affected as well. As <b>F-T</b> fuels have some other combustion characteristics than conventional diesel fuels, the most expected effect would be observed on emission levels, particularly on NOx and soot formation. However, it was observed that other emissions such as HC and CO were remarkably affected as well. Also, a combination of the different <b>F-T</b> fuels mixture would lead to a better engine performance and lower emission levels.

40|$|Polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{have been}} shown to disrupt thyroid hormone (TH) functions on experimental animals, and one of the proposed disruption mechanisms is the competitive binding of PBDE metabolites to TH transport proteins. In this report, a nonradioactive, site-specific fluorescein-thyroxine (<b>F-T</b> 4) conjugate was designed and synthesized as a fluorescence probe to study the binding interaction of hydroxylated PBDEs to thyroxine-binding globulin (TBG) and transthyretin (TTR), two major TH transport proteins in human plasma. Compared with free <b>F-T</b> 4, the fluorescence intensity of TTR-bound conjugate was enhanced by as much as 2 -fold, and the fluorescence polarization value of TBG-bound conjugate increased by more than 20 -fold. These changes provide signal modulation mechanisms for <b>F-T</b> 4 as a fluorescence probe. Based on fluorescence quantum yield and lifetime measurements, the fluorescence intensity enhancement was likely due to the elimination of intramolecular fluorescence quenching of fluorescein by T 4 after <b>F-T</b> 4 was bound to TTR. In circular dichroism and intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence measurements, <b>F-T</b> 4 induced similar spectroscopic changes of the proteins as T 4 did, suggesting that <b>F-T</b> 4 bound to the proteins at the T 4 binding site.

40|$|The Fisher-Tully (<b>F-T)</b> '' 10 Mpc Catalog of Late-Type Galaxies'' {{is remarkably}} complete. Despite the {{considerable}} effort {{that has been}} spent searching for and cataloging low surface brightness (LSB) galaxies, almost no new HI-rich galaxies {{have been added to}} the volume to which the <b>F-T</b> observations were both sensitive [d < 10 (M-HI/ 10 (8. 2) M-.) (5 / 12) Mpc] and intended to be complete (d < 10 Mpc). It has not yet been demonstrated by the new surveys that HI-rich LSB galaxies are not properly represented in this catalog of nearby galaxies. Although new optical surveys are discovering heretofore uncataloged galaxies at greater distances than the depth of the <b>F-T</b> catalog, they do not alter the completeness of the <b>F-T</b> catalog for H I-rich LSB objects. Thus, unless the galaxy population of the local volume is atypical, there is at present no evidence for a significant, new population of gas-rich galaxies that has escaped recognition until now...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} retain {{stability}} and integrity over years {{of exposure to}} the destructive forces of weathering {{is one of the most}} important aspects of cementitiously stabilized layers (CSL) in pavement design. However, the changes of the CSL properties over time and their distress models have not been adequately addressed in the Mechanistic-Empirical Pavement Design Guide (MEPDG). The objectives of this study were to identify mechanical properties changes of CSLs which are undergoing exposure to weathering, such as freeze-thaw (<b>F-T)</b> and wet-dry (W-D) cycling, and also to validate and develop durability performance models. Unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and vacuum saturation were also examined for correlation with the durability performance of the CSLs. Ultrasonic pulse velocity measurement was conducted as a non-destructive test to monitor the effect of <b>F-T</b> and W-D cycling on base and subgrade soils with cement, fly ash, and lime stabilization. Laboratory durability tests involved <b>F-T</b> cycling, W-D cycling, and vacuum saturation on nine cementitiously stabilized mixtures (CSM). P-wave velocity measurement after each <b>F-T</b> and W-D cycle and UCS at the end of <b>F-T</b> and W-D cycling were conducted. <b>F-T</b> cycling was an aggressive test, which resulted in degradation in the constrained modulus (D) (up to 71 %) and UCS (up to 69 %) of all CSMs. The <b>F-T</b> durability performance of the mixtures was greatly affected by the binder content, binder type, and also soil type. Reduction in normalized constrained modulus after the first <b>F-T</b> cycle indicated the frost susceptibility of CSM. Some mixtures showed high resistance to degradation during the first <b>F-T</b> cycle (constrained modulus reduction < 10 %), including silt-lime-fly ash, sand-cement, gravel-cement, gravel-fly ash, and sand-fly ash. Mixtures with higher initial UCS had less reduction in constrained modulus after the first <b>F-T</b> cycle and less reduction after the W-D cycling as well. Cement-stabilized soils were more durable to <b>F-T</b> cycling with generally higher residual constrained modulus and UCS. Class C fly ash was less effective than lime-fly ash (Class F) with respect to improvement in the durability, strength, and stiffness of silt. Binder content influenced <b>F-T</b> durability significantly; the greater the cement content, the stronger the <b>F-T</b> durability. An exponential modulus decay model is proposed to account for the effect of <b>F-T</b> cycling. A regression constant, k, can be used as a quantitative index of <b>F-T</b> susceptibility to characterize the performance of CSM. The smaller the k value, the more susceptible the mixtures were to <b>F-T</b> cycling. The effect of initial constrained modulus and UCS on the k value was investigated: mixtures with higher initial constrained modulus or UCS had smaller k, with the exception of clay-cement and gravel-cement mixtures. The <b>F-T</b> susceptibility was divided into four categories: ?high?, ?moderate?, ?low?, and ?negligible? based on several criteria. W-D cycling was not as detrimental as <b>F-T</b> cycling to CSM except for clay-lime and sand-fly ash mixtures. Some CSM had continuing cementation in cement mixtures and pozzolanic reactions in fly ash or lime mixtures, reflected in the enhancement in constrained modulus and UCS after the first W-D cycle. Cement-stabilized soils were the most durable to W-D cycling, having the largest residual constrained modulus and UCS among all CSM except gravel, for which fly ash was more effective. The combinations of silt with cement or lime-fly ash significantly improved the stiffness and W-D durability, but not with Class C fly ash. A basic W-D durability model involving a reduction factor (fR) for D is proposed for CSM subjected to W-D cycling. A larger fR means more reduction in D when subject to W-D cycling. Generally, fR for stabilized fine-grained soil (silt and clay) are larger than that for stabilized coarse-grained soil (sand and gravel), except for gravel-cement with 3 % cement content. Generally, fR increases with increasing void ratio for CSM. The vacuum saturation procedure fully saturated the specimens. The vacuum-saturated specimens generally had lower UCS compared to that of unsaturated specimens. Although the correlation between residual UCS after <b>F-T</b> cycling versus UCS after vacuum saturation was not very strong, the vacuum saturation test can still serve as a fast way to predict the sensitivity to <b>F-T</b> of CSM when the complete <b>F-T</b> cycling test is not available. Effect of curing progress, moisture content, and compaction characteristics on the P-wave velocity for CSM was investigated as an extension of this study. In general, the P-wave velocity or constrained modulus of the mixtures increased with curing time. The increase in P-wave velocity and constrained modulus from the first to seventh curing days was more pronounced than the increase from the seventh to twenty-eighth curing days for cement-stabilized soil. A slow pozzolanic reaction in lime and fly ash stabilization was also detectable with the ultrasonic wave testing. Unsaturated specimens with higher P-wave velocity had a much smaller increase in P-wave velocity after saturation. The saturation-stiffening effect on the P-wave velocity tended to be larger for soft CSM specimens with low P-wave velocity. The trend between UCS versus dry density or compaction water content was the same as the trend of the P-wave velocity versus dry density. Therefore, the specimens with higher P-wave velocity possessed higher strength (i. e., UCS) for each CSM mixture. For stabilized fine-grained soils, there was a peak in P-wave velocity coinciding with the maximum dry density, whereas for stabilized sand or granular base materials, this trend was not present. The P-wave velocity and constrained modulus were strongly correlated to the UCS and elastic modulus (e. g., E 0 and E 50). The strength of CSM increased with increasing P-wave velocity. The predicted UCS was less proportional using prediction model determined from P-wave velocity than constrained modulus. The prediction model was also verified by the unsaturated UCS. Linear relationships between VP and E 0, VP and E 50, D and E 0, and D and E 50 were observed. Constrained modulus correlated best with E 0, with R 2 = 0. 71. In this study, the durability performance of CSM was studied and a distress model corresponding to freeze-thaw cycling and wet-dry cycling was proposed. Vacuum saturation techniques were used to correlate to <b>F-T</b> cycling. The characteristics of ultrasonic P-wave in CSM were investigated...|$|R
40|$|The Fischer-Tropsch (<b>F-T)</b> {{reaction}} {{provides a}} way of converting coal-derived synthesis gas (CO+H{sub 2 }) to liquid fuels. Since the reaction is highly exothermic, {{one of the major}} problems in control of the reaction is heat removal. Recent work has shown that the use of slurry bubble column reactors (SBCRs) can largely solve this problem. Iron-based (Fe) catalysts are preferred catalysts for <b>F-T</b> because they are relatively inexpensive and possess reasonable activity for <b>F-T</b> synthesis (FTS). Their most advantages trait is their high water-gas shift (WGS) activity compared to their competitor, namely cobalt. This enables Fe <b>F-T</b> catalysts to process low H{sub 2 }/CO ratio synthesis gas without an external shift reaction step. However, a serious problem with the use of Fe catalysts in a SBCR is their tendency to undergo attrition. This can cause fouling/plugging of downstream filters and equipment, make the separation of catalyst from the oil/wax product very difficult if not impossible, an d result in a steady loss of catalyst from the reactor. The objectives of this research were to develop {{a better understanding of the}} parameters affecting attrition of Fe <b>F-T</b> catalysts suitable for use in SBCRs and to incorporate this understanding into the design of novel Fe catalysts having superior attrition resistance...|$|R
