Its first public steaming took place on 8 July 2017 at Alan Keef Ltd. Lyn was delivered to Woody Bay in September 2017, and first ran there on 28 September.|$|E
500|$|A <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> {{manufacturing}} plant {{was set up}} by Bharat Heavy Electricals Limited (BHEL), India's largest public sector engineering company, in May 1965. This was followed by a [...] steel plant and a boiler auxiliaries plant. In 2010, the Tiruchirappalli unit of the company contributed to nearly 30 per cent of its total sales, making it the largest of all units. As of 2011, the Tiruchirappalli division employed about 10,000 people, and is supported by a number of ancillary industries producing almost [...] of fabricated materials. These ancillary units together with BHEL contribute nearly 60 per cent of India's steel fabrication, earning the city the title, [...] "Energy equipment and fabrication capital of India". Other important industries in Tiruchirappalli include Trichy Distilleries and Chemicals Limited (TDCL), which was established at Senthaneerpuram in the former Golden Rock municipality in 1966. and the Trichy Steel Rolling Mills, which was started as a private limited company on 27 June 1961. The Trichy Distilleries and Chemicals Limited manufactures rectified spirit, acetaldehyde, acetic acid, acetic anhydride and ethyl acetate. It {{is one of the biggest}} private sector distilleries in Tamil Nadu and produced [...] of spirit alcohol between December 2005 and November 2006. The Ordnance Factories Board runs a weapons manufacturing unit and a Heavy Alloy Penetrator Project (HAPP) facility; the latter was set up in the late 1980s and comprises a flexible manufacturing system (FMS)—the first of its kind in India.|$|E

50|$|The first <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> were a large drum with {{a central}} flue, such as the Cornish and Lancashire boilers. Simple tubes were {{inserted}} across this flue.|$|R
50|$|Antilla and {{her sisters}} had turbo-electric transmission. Each ship had two oil-fired <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> that fed a single AEG turbo generator. This {{produced}} current for an AEG electric propulsion motor that drove a single propeller shaft.|$|R
5000|$|The Sentinel Waggon Works built {{numerous}} geared shunting locomotives {{to several}} designs mainly with vertical water-tube boilers and high-speed, enclosed, poppet-valve engines. These combined <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> with high-reduction gearing to provide high torque at low speeds.|$|R

50|$|A 4-6-4 {{streamlined}} express passenger locomotive, using a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler.</b> Each of {{the three}} driven axles {{had a pair of}} three-cylinder double-acting uniflow steam motors, giving 18 cylinders in total.|$|E
25|$|Used as an {{accommodation}} ship and troopship during World War II, she {{was seized by}} the Allies in 1945 and renamed Empire Jewel. She was converted to a troopship in 1946 but her <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> proved troublesome and the ship was rebuilt in 1947 and renamed Empire Fowey.|$|R
50|$|Developments in <b>high-pressure</b> {{water-tube}} <b>boilers</b> {{for marine}} use placed more demands on safety valves. Valves of greater capacity were required, to vent safely the high steam-generating capacity of these large boilers. As the force on their valves increased, {{the issue of}} the spring's increasing stiffness as its load increased (like the Naylor valve) became more critical. The need to reduced valve feathering became even more important with <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers,</b> as this represented both a loss of distilled feedwater and also a scouring of the valve seats, leading to wear.|$|R
25|$|A {{water-tube}} boiler {{is a type}} of boiler {{in which}} water circulates in tubes heated externally by the fire. Water-tube boilers are used for <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers.</b> Fuel is burned inside the furnace, creating hot gas which heats up water in the steam-generating tubes. The water-tube boiler was co-invented and co-patented by George Herman Babcock and Stephen Wilcox in 1867.|$|R
50|$|The {{evaporation}} engine has broadly comparable {{theoretical efficiency}} to simple Rankine steam turbines, without need for <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> or condenser. The evaporation engine can function well on industrial waste heat, particularly the exhaust gas of open-cycle gas turbines.|$|E
50|$|In 1925, {{locomotive}} 17 206 {{was given}} a Schmidt-Hartmann <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> with a boiler overpressure of 5.884 MPa (58.84 bar), and the drive was converted to a compound configuration. The increased performance of the H 17 206 designated locomotive compared with the production design did not justify the higher construction costs however; the engine was converted back to the standard design in 1929 and retired in 1936.|$|E

25|$|Each {{ship had}} turbo-electric transmission, {{with a pair}} of steam turbo {{generators}} generating current that powered propulsion motors on the twin propeller shafts. General Electric built the turbo generators and propulsion motors for President Coolidge but Westinghouse built the turbo generators and propulsion motors for President Hoover. 12 oil-fired Babcock & Wilcox <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> supplied the steam for President Hoovers turbo-generators. The electric propulsion motors produced 26,500 shp at 133 RPM.|$|R
50|$|The H02 1001 {{locomotive}} was {{the only}} example of the Schwarzkopff-Löffler <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> system, a complex technology in which heat was extracted from the firebox by tubes filled with steam rather than boiling water. It was delivered in 1930 to the Deutsche Reichsbahn (DRG). Schwarzkopff guaranteed in the purchase contract a coal saving of 42% over a standard 01 locomotive design, but in the event the DRG never bought the locomotive.|$|E
50|$|The Schmidt {{system used}} a sealed ultra-high-pressure circuit that simply {{transferred}} heat to a high-pressure circuit, {{by means of}} heating coils inside a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler.</b> If this latter was fed with ordinary water, scale could form {{on the outside of}} the heating coils, but it could not cause overheating because the ultra-HP tubes were quite capable of withstanding their internal steam temperature, though not the firebox flame temperature.|$|E
50|$|The MZA {{commissioned}} {{an enhanced}} 1700 type, designed with a streamlined casing á la mode and designated the 1800 type. The Spanish Civil War interrupted construction and the ten machines were only completed {{after the war}} was ended in 1939. Although well designed and good performers in theory, they lacked the advantages of streamline casing and especially suffered from {{problems associated with the}} <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> that needed specially designed lubricators that were not available in the impoverished post-war Spain.|$|E
50|$|It all {{begins at}} the Praça do Carvão (Coal Square), the {{reception}} space, also a venue for exhibits and events; it was here in this location that, arriving from the Tagus River, tons of coal was unloaded to supply the boilers. In this same square, visitors can observe the sieve, the silos and the bucket elevators that mixed and carried the coal to the building’s upper section and the <b>High-Pressure</b> <b>boilers.</b>|$|R

50|$|He was {{the third}} son of John Martineau, the elder, of Stamford Hill. Through the mining {{interests}} of the Martineau family, he {{came into contact with}} his cousins John Taylor and Philip Taylor, who became business partners. At that point the Taylors were running a chemical business, backed by Martineau money. John Martineau's uncles worked in dyeing, textiles and sugar. Under the influence of the Martineaus, the Taylors introduced a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> manufactured by John Braithwaite the younger.|$|E
50|$|A sudden steam leak {{into the}} firebox is perilous enough with a {{conventional}} boiler- {{the fire is}} likely to be blasted out of the firebox door, with unhappy results for anyone in the way. With a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> the results are even more dangerous because of the greater release of energy. This was demonstrated by the Fury tragedy, though the reason for the tube failure in that case was concluded to be overheating due to lack of steam flow rather than scaling.|$|E
5000|$|Exploding rat - dead rats were {{prepared}} {{for use by the}} British Special Operations Executive in World War II against Germany. Rat carcasses were filled with plastic explosives, to be left in locations such as factories where, it was hoped, the stoker tending a boiler would likely dispose of the unpleasant discovery by shoveling it into the furnace, causing it to explode. The rats contained only a small amount of explosive; however, a puncture of a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler</b> could trigger a devastating boiler explosion.|$|E
50|$|The {{availability}} of cheap steel allowed building larger bridges, railroads, skyscrapers, and ships. Other important steel products—also made using the open hearth process—were steel cable, steel rod and sheet steel which enabled large, <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers</b> and high-tensile strength steel for machinery which enabled {{much more powerful}} engines, gears and axles than were previously possible. With large amounts of steel it became possible to build much more powerful guns and carriages, tanks, armored fighting vehicles and naval ships.|$|R

5000|$|In 1938, Bulleid gained {{approval}} {{to build the}} Merchant Navy class of modern 4-6-2 [...] "Pacifics", undoubtedly inspired by Gresley but also drawing on his experiences from across Europe {{and with all the}} most modern equipment: a partially welded boiler and firebox rather than traditional rivetted designs, thermic syphons and a <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler.</b> It also included chain-driven valve-gear immersed in an oil bath, a feature that was controversial and later caused problems if not maintained properly, which was difficult, due to conditions, after WW2.|$|E
50|$|Locomotion Enterprises, a {{training}} {{company in the}} North-East of England, got the task of building the new engine whilst W Bertram & Sons of South Shields provided a new <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boiler,</b> fittingly to the same design as the Ffestiniog Railway's locomotive Prince. Vickers shipyard itself undertook the task of making the new hull, using it as an engineering exercise for the apprentices, probably more {{at home with the}} hulls of nuclear submarines!

5|$|The Admiral Hipper-class {{ships were}} powered by {{three sets of}} geared steam {{turbines}}. Admiral Hippers and Blüchers engines were built by Blohm & Voss, while Prinz Eugens turbines were built by Germaniawerft. The turbines installed on Seydlitzs and Lützows engines were manufactured by Deschimag. Steam was provided {{in the first three}} ships by twelve ultra-high-pressure boilers. Seydlitz and Lützow were equipped with nine double-ended <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers.</b> Admiral Hippers and Prinz Eugens boilers were manufactured by Wagner, while the boilers for the other three ships were built by La Mont.|$|R
50|$|Conway's {{states that}} the first three ships were to have been armed with the SS-N-9 anti-ship missile but Soviet naval {{doctrine}} changed with greater emphasis on anti-submarine warfare. The surface-to-air missiles comprised more advanced SA-N-3 missiles with two twin launchers. New 3D search radar and new fire control radars were also fitted. 4 30mm CIWS guns were also fitted for improved anti-missile defence. A more advanced sonar led to the bow being more sharply raked. The machinery suite comprised two TV-12 steam turbines with <b>high-pressure</b> <b>boilers,</b> identical to the Kresta I class.|$|R
