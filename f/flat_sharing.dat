40|$|Many cluster {{management}} systems (CMSs) {{have been proposed}} to share a single cluster with multiple distributed computing systems. However, none of the existing approaches can handle distributed machine learning (ML) workloads given the following criteria: high resource utilization, fair resource allocation and low sharing overhead. To solve this problem, we propose a new CMS named Dorm, incorporating a dynamically-partitioned cluster management mechanism and an utilization-fairness optimizer. Specifically, Dorm uses the container-based virtualization technique to partition a cluster, runs one application per partition, and can dynamically resize each partition at application runtime for resource efficiency and fairness. Each application directly launches its tasks on the assigned partition without petitioning for resources frequently, so Dorm imposes <b>flat</b> <b>sharing</b> overhead. Extensive performance evaluations showed that Dorm could simultaneously increase the resource utilization {{by a factor of}} up to 2. 32, reduce the fairness loss by a factor of up to 1. 52, and speed up popular distributed ML applications by a factor of up to 2. 72, compared to existing approaches. Dorm's sharing overhead is less than 5 % in most cases...|$|E

5000|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} forms of <b>flat</b> <b>shares</b> also, from the more established <b>flat</b> <b>shares</b> where the flatmate will get their own room that is furnished to [...] "couch surfing" [...] where people lend their sofa for a short period.Sharehome residents are typically unrelated {{to each other in}} that they generally come from different families, although they may be composed of some siblings and sometimes single parents and their children. Perhaps because of the social cohesion required for their formation, sharehomes will often be composed of members of the same peer group. For example, university students who have relocated to a new area to commence a course of study often need to form a sharehome. Share housing often occurs in the 18-35 age bracket - during a life stage between leaving home and having children. Sharehome residents may have pre-existing friendships or other interpersonal relationships or they may form new relationships whilst living together.|$|R
