However, some computer users have abused the technology {{used to drive}} these communications, by sending out {{thousands and thousands of}} spam emails with little or no purpose other than to increase traffic or decrease bandwidth. With the electronic mail emerging as the primary means of communication, sorting of electronic mails is of prime importance. Most current sorting techniques are rule based, in which the user is supposed to give a set of rules, according to which mails are sorted. But configuring these rules is a tedious and often impossible task due to the variety of emails.

40|$|International audienceThis work {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} document image analysis, and more particularly the topic of document structure recognition in old, damaged and handwritten document. The goal {{of this paper is}} to present the interest of the human perceptive vision for document analysis. We focus on two aspects of the model of perceptive vision: the perceptive cycle and the visual attention. We present the key elements of the perceptive vision that can be used for document analysis. Thus, we introduce the perceptive vision in an existing method for document structure recognition, which enable both to show how we used the properties of the perceptive vision and to compare the results obtained with and without perceptive vision. We apply our method for the analysis of several kinds of documents (archive registers, old newspapers, <b>incoming</b> <b>mails...)</b> and show that the perceptive vision signicantly improves their recognition. Moreover, the use of the perceptive vision simplies the description of complex documents. At last, the running time is often reduced...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} a complete system able to categorize handwritten documents, i. e. to classify documents {{according to their}} topic. The categorization approach {{is based on the}} detection of some discrim- inative keywords prior {{to the use of the}} well known tf-idf representation for document categorization. Two keyword extraction strategies are explored. The rst one proceeds to the recognition of the whole document. However, the performance of this strategy strongly de- creases when the lexicon size increases. The second strat- egy only extracts the discriminative keywords in the handwritten documents. This information extraction strategy relies on the integration of a rejection model (or anti-lexicon model) in the recognition system. Ex- periments have been carried out on an unconstrained handwritten document database coming from an indus- trial application concerning the processing of <b>incoming</b> <b>mails.</b> Results show that the discriminative keyword ex- traction system leads to better recall/precision trade- o s than the full recognition strategy.

40|$|Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) is a {{well known}} attack in which a {{malicious}} webpage instructs the victim's browser to send out requests to legitimate sites {{on behalf of the}} victim, while piggybacking on the authorized sessions of the victim. CSRF attacks are typically transparent for the victim, and for legitimate websites it is hard to differentiate between requests initiated by the victim, and requests initiated by the malicious webpage. Although this type of vulnerability is already known for about a decade, CSRF recently gained much more attention because of its impact on contemporary e-society. In November 2007, a vulnerability in GMail was exploited to forward <b>incoming</b> <b>mails</b> of the victims to an arbitrary account.

40|$|Abstract — Data leakage is {{a process}} in which a data {{distributor}} has given important data to a supposedly trusted agents and some of the data is leaked and found in an unauthorized place or unauthorized user. An enterprise data leak is a scary statement. Security practitioners have always had to deal with data leakage issues that spring up from various ways like email, IM and other Internet channels. One or more agents can leak the data. Moreover, data can also be leaked from within an organization via e-mails. So, there is need to filter these e-mails. The mail can be filtered by blocking e-mails which contains images, videos or sensitive data of an enterprise. The e-mail is one of the sources of data leakage. Principle used in e-mail security is we classify e-mail, sensitive data into the white and black lists with document’s digital signature value. The data can also be changed by the trusted agents. The system will detect such a changes of the sensitive data and if founds same as black list it will block the mail or stop for review. Then the distributor will decide to allow or disallow the <b>incoming</b> <b>mails</b> from the agent’s. The system will prevent the enterprise data from data leakage. E-mail security system will make the data more secure. Index Terms – Black List, SHA, TF, White List...|$|E
