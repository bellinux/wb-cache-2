40|$|In {{the frame}} of the present {{doctoral}} thesis the <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> was developed to enable an effective assessment of the cohesion {{and at the same time}} adhesion strength of thin hard coatings. During this test, a spherical indenter impacts periodically on the coated surface under a desired maximum load at a constant impact inclination angle. The initial aim was to clarify the dominating mechanisms that act on during the coating failure initiation, by the <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test.</b> The mentioned experimental procedure is supported by a recently developed FEM simulation model that predicts the coating failure initiation, considering the mechanical properties of all materials and the adhesion strength in the coating-substrate interface. Through this model, it is possible to calculate the critical stresses in the coating and to quantify the bonding strength between the coating and the substrate as a constant of these materials compound. The <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> was applied also on coated specimens in non lubricated environment, as well as on specimens of the same type and coating that were placed in lubricating emulsion. With the application of this emulsion and with the determination of appropriate experimental conditions, the diminishing of the fatigue effect from the failure mechanisms was achieved, in order to investigate exclusively the coating microabrasive behaviour. The possibility to test the coatings as deposited on bearing ring surfaces, i. e. directly on the final product, is pivotal, because the PVD process significantly affects the attained film properties and adhesion. Hereupon, the coating mechanical properties and the adhesion were investigated through the procedures based on the present doctoral thesis, in order to exhibit the application of such methodologies in a practical application that displays singularities in the conduct of the experimental procedures. Finally, especially for coatings with larger thicknesses, such as the thermal spray ones, a methodology that can quantify the coating removal rate was developed, in order to enable the direct comparison of the impact test performances of various coatings, which could be used to enhance the lifetime of parts used in specific applications. ...|$|E

40|$|The <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> is an {{efficient}} method for characterizing the fatigue strength of interfaces of nanocrystalline diamond coatings (NCD). During this test, an oscillating oblique load induces repetitive shear stresses {{into the region}} between film and its substrate. Inclined impact tests were conducted on NCD coated specimens with a thickness of ca. 5 mu m at forces up to 850 N and 1. 5 million loading cycles. The related imprints were evaluated by confocal microscopy measurements and EDX micro-analyses. Dependent on the applied load, after {{a certain number of}} impacts, damages in the film interface region develop resulting in coating detachment In this way, residual stresses of the film are released leading to its lifting (bulge formation). The bulges are destroyed by further repetitive impacts and the coating is totally removed. The geometry of the developed NCD coating's bulges can be effectively described by appropriate Finite Element Method (FEM) supported calculations. Based on the attained impact test results, Woehler-like diagrams were developed for monitoring the fatigue failure or endurance of NCD coatings at various impact conditions. Employing such diagrams, the fatigue strength of NCD coatings can be assessed. According to the attained Woehler-like diagrams, a threshold load of 730 N exists for the film delamination by fatigue in the investigated case...|$|E

40|$|The cutting {{performance}} of coated tools can be significantly improved by tailoring the coatings properties to application of specific requirements. For achieving this target, optimised PVD processes {{as well as}} appropriate substrate pre- and posttreatments of the coated surfaces have to be employed. To check the effectiveness of all these methods, innovative quality inspection tests should be applied. In the recent 3 years, various innovative methods for characterising the coatings properties towards explaining their performance in cutting applications have been developed. Characteristic related methods are {{presented in this paper}} and applications results are provided for demonstrating the effectiveness of these methods. In this context, nano-impact test is an effective tool for assessing the coatings strength and their brittleness as well. With the aid of its FEM simulation, a theoretical explanation of the nano-impact test results, concerning the film fracture initiati on and evolution, is attained. For investigating the effect of strain rate on the surface response and film fatigue fracture of coated specimens subjected to cyclic impact loads, an impact tester was developed, facilitating the impact force modulation concerning its signal pattern. The surface response depends, among others, on the substrate and coating strain, strain rate properties. Repetitive impact loads with variable duration are exercised on coated cutting edge in interrupted machining operations, depending on the applied kinematics and cutting conditions, as for example in milling. The coated tool life under certain cutting conditions was correlated to the film strain rate-dependent fatigue behaviour. In this way, the coated inserts cutting performance at various conditions was explained, considering the impact test results with modulated repetitive force. Finally, <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> is a further procedure, which is analytically described appropriately by (FEM- based techniques, allowing the determination of films adhesion, in cases where the Rockwell indentation tests fail to deliver reliable results...|$|E
40|$|The {{interface}} {{fatigue strength}} of coated tools with nano-crystalline diamond (NCD) coatings affects their milling performance. Depending on the developed cutting loads and temperatures, the repetitive {{impacts on the}} tool deteriorate progressively the coating-substrate interface strength, thus influencing the effective NCD film adhesion. Aiming at a comprehensive investigation of this effect, NCD coated cemented carbide inserts with improved or insufficient adhesion were manufactured. Hereupon, a parameter characterizing the coatings' interface adhesion strength, the shear failure stress (SFLS) was estimated by inclined impact tests and FEM calculations at ambient and elevated temperatures. This metric is significantly affected, among others, by the compressive residual stresses developed in the NCD film during cooling after its deposition and the coating operational temperature. A correlation between the determined SFLS at the investigated adhesion levels and the FEM calculated maximum shear stress in the coating interface during milling AA 7075 T 6 contributed to the explanation of the wear evolution on the employed NCD coated tools. Prime novelty statement The submitted paper aims at investigating {{the effect of the}} interface fatigue strength of NCD coated hardmetal inserts on their cutting performance in milling. The fatigue strength of the NCD coating-substrate interface is a dominant mechanical property for the NCD coated tool life. In the submitted work, NCD coated cemented carbide inserts with different adhesion qualities were manufactured. The interface fatigue strength at temperatures up to 400 [*]Â°C was quantified using a critical shear failure stress (SFLS). This was attained by conducting appropriate FEM supported evaluation of the <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> results at ambient and elevated temperatures. A correlation between the determined SFLS at various adhesion levels and the FEM calculated maximum shear stress in the film interface during milling AA 7075 T 6 contributed to the explanation of the wear evolution on the employed NCD coated tools.

Abstract Wood pallets are often put in circulation for several years. In a palletâ€™s lifetime it goes through several wet-dry cycles. In this study, softwood pallet specimens were compressed statically and impacted at different water contents through an accelerated drying process for three repeated wet-dry cycles.

The films used were deposited on cemented carbide inserts by employing cathodic arc evaporation. For determining coating strength properties, nanoindentations were carried out. Based on the data acquired and a FEM continuous simulation of nanoindentation, elasto-plastic laws for the films were determined. The adhesion of the coatings was evaluated by <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> and by Rockwell indentations.

According to these laws, the TiSiN films possess enhanced mechanical properties in comparison to TiAlN and TiN coatings. Moreover, in perpendicular impact experiments at various temperatures, the TiSiN films exhibited the best resistance and fatigue behaviour. Additionally, Rockwell C indentations and <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> were performed to assess qualitatively and quantitatively the films' adhesion on the substrate.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of the coating deposition technologies led, among others, {{to the production of}} nano-structured coatings. Such coatings are often deposited on cutting tools since they contribute to an impressive enhancement of the coated tool life. Hereupon, attention has to be given for avoiding a rapid crack propagation due to a potential coating brittleness increase and for achieving a sufficient film adhesion. In this context, film residual stresses and structure may affect the film adhesion. This paper introduces characteristic measures for an effective application of nano-structured PVD and diamond coatings on cemented carbide tools in milling. More specifically, the adhesion of PVD HPPMS nano-structured coatings can be improved via an appropriate adhesive interlayer. Besides, the coating brittleness can be restricted through the application of nano multi-layer film structures. Furthermore, for improving the diamond coated tool performance, the diamond film nano-structure may be interrupted by micro diamond layers. The introduction of successive nano- and micro-structured layers restricts the film brittleness since micro-structured layers are more deformable compared to nano-structured ones. Finally, the interfacial fatigue strength of diamond coatings is affected by the film residual stresses. <b>Inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> supported by appropriate FEM simulations facilitate the quantitative adhesion characterization of such films...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} two {{different}} treatments of cemented carbide substrates, prior to the deposition of a nanocrystalline diamond (NCD) coating, on the film interface fatigue strength was investigated at ambient and elevated temperatures. The first substrate treatment of the cemented carbide substrate was a selective chemical Co-etching and the second one the deposition of a Cr-adhesive layer. <b>Inclined</b> <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> at 25 [*]Â°C and 300 [*]Â°C were performed on the NCD coated specimens. The related imprints were evaluated by confocal microscopy measurements and EDX micro-analyses. The thermal residual stresses developed in the film structure at various temperatures were estimated by Finite Element Method (FEM) calculations. A fatigue damage in the NCD coating interface region was induced by the repetitive impacts. After this damage, the compressive residual stresses in the NCD film are released leading to its lifting from the substrate (bulge formation) and subsequent coating failure. The NCD film-substrate interface fatigue behavior is significantly affected by the test temperature. Based on the attained results at diverse substrate treatments, Woehler-like diagrams were developed for monitoring the fatigue failure of NCD coating interface area at 25 [*]Â°C and 300 [*]Â°C. The interfacial fatigue strength worsens as the <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> temperature grows in both examined substrate treatment cases.

These treatments were grinding at a medium roughness level, or grinding with subsequent polishing for enhancing the surface integrity and finally, in all cases, micro-blasting by fine Al 2 O 3 grains. After Ar-ion etching, graded Cr/CrN adhesive layers with different thicknesses were deposited by HPPMS technology on the variously pretreated substrates.

Purpose. The {{object of}} the {{presented}} work is the finite element analysis of Charpy <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> in the two-dimensional and three-dimensional formulations. Design/methodology/approach. Charpy specimens <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> are one of more simple and inexpensive method to determine the mechanical properties of materials. The results of these tests {{can be used to}} estimate the strength and durability of large-scale structures. Numerical simulation of Charpy specimens <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> can give more information about the features of of crack initiation and propagation in materials under dynamic loading. Findings. Numerical modelling of Charpy specimens <b>impact</b> <b>tests</b> was performed using Gurson?Tvergaard?Needleman (GTN) damage material model. According to the results of numerical simulation the diagrams of normal stresses and strains in the crack tip were plotted and the crack propagation velocities for the case of ductile and quasi-brittle fracture were calculated. Originality/value. The results of numerical modelling of Charpy specimens <b>impact</b> <b>test</b> can be used to evaluate the strength and lifetime of construction elements. ???? ????????? ????????? ????????????? ??????? ????????? ???????? ????? ? ?????????? ? ?????????? ??????????? ??????? ???????? ????????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ?????????????? ????????? ???????-?????????-????????. ???????? ?????? ???????? ??? ? ??????? ??????? ??? ?? ?????????? ? ??????????????? ? ????????? ??????? ?????. ????????? ??????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????? ?? ??????? ??? ????????? ???? ??????????. ???????? ?????? ??????? ???? ???????????? ????????? ?? ??? ? ??????? ??????? ? ?? ???????? ?? ???????????????...|$|R
40|$|In {{disruptive}} {{hot plasma}} wall interaction a dense and rather cold plasma shield is formed from evaporated material {{in front of}} the target at an early stage of the interaction. Electric potential distributions in the plasma shield hot plasma interaction region and energy deposition profiles were calculated both for perpendicular {{and for the first time}} also for <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> of the hot magnetized plasma along the guiding magnetic field. For perpendicular impact, the calculation of the electric potential in the plasma shield is based on the Poisson equation and the condition of zero electric current. The analysis for <b>inclined</b> <b>impact</b> of magnetized hot plasma uses a non-stationary Vlasov Maxwell model, the condition of zero current perpendicular to the target and the existence of an uncompensated current in toroidal direction. In the hot plasma region a significant potential drop occurs resulting in a lateral drift motion (deflection) of the impacting hot plasma. The evolution of an additional magnetic field could result in a self compression of the plasma shield. The dynamics of this self compression and its consequences for the plasma shield stability and for erosion still need more detailed investigations. (orig.) 24 refs.
