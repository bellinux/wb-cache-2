In southern California habitats, black abalones are thought to feed on the <b>giant</b> <b>kelp</b> (Macrocystis pyrifera) and feather boa kelp (Egregia menziesii), while in central and northern California habitats they feed on the bull kelp (Nereocystis leutkeana).|$|E
25|$|The {{environmental}} factors necessary for kelp to survive include hard substrate (usually rock or sand), high nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus), and light (minimum annual irradiance dose > 50 E m−2). Especially productive kelp forests {{tend to be}} associated with areas of significant oceanographic upwelling, a process that delivers cool, nutrient-rich water from depth to the ocean’s mixed surface layer. Water flow and turbulence facilitate nutrient assimilation across kelp fronds throughout the water column. Water clarity affects the depth to which sufficient light can be transmitted. In ideal conditions, <b>giant</b> <b>kelp</b> (Macrocystis spp.) can grow as much as 30-60 cm vertically per day. Some species, such as Nereocystis, are annuals, while others such as Eisenia are perennials, living for more than 20 years. In perennial kelp forests, maximum growth rates occur during upwelling months (typically spring and summer) and die-backs correspond to reduced nutrient availability, shorter photoperiods, and increased storm frequency.|$|E

50|$|Laminaria {{expresses a}} haplo-diplophasic life history {{in which it}} {{alternates}} from a macroscopic thallic sporophyte structure, consisting of the holdfast, a stipe, and the blades, to a filamentous, microscopic gametophyte. The sporophyte structure of laminaria can grow to 7 m, which is large in comparison to other algae, but still smaller than the <b>giant</b> <b>kelps</b> such as Macrocystis and Nereocystic that can grow up to 40 - 50 m. The gametophyte structure, however {{is no more than}} a few millimeters in length. In opposition to the gametophyte phase, which only consists of one type of tissue, the more complex sporophyte phase is made up of different types of tissue. One of these tissues includes a sieve-like element which translocates photassimilates(Schmitz 1982). These structures are very similar to mesophyll cells found in higher plant leaves.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{variety of}} marine coastal environments of Mexico has been scientifically recognized; {{allowing}} the high diversity of organisms. The floristic richness (macroalgae species) includes <b>giant</b> <b>kelps</b> of cold environments of the Pacific coast, which are economically and ecologically important. This {{also includes a}} wide variety of macroalgae species from temperate and tropical environments. This ecological diversity is currently threatened and affected by the impact of climate change and by the non-native species introduction related by increased tourist routes and commercial navigation to Baja California shores. Based on a monitoring program of introduced macroalgae species, in the last 15 years several non-native species have been collected in the facilities of the port of Ensenada, Baja California. The species Sargassum muticum, Sargassum filicinum, Grateloupia turuturu and Grateloupia lanceolata, grow on different substrates in the Port, and because they grow abundantly, tend to displace native species and are therefore considered biological contamination. This work includes a review of the introduced macroalgae to the Port of Ensenada, their current distribution in Mexico and discusses its probable origin and possible vectors of introduction...|$|R

40|$|As on land, {{plants are}} the real {{producers}} in the sea, and on them depend all marine living resources and the basic sustainability of ecosystems. Primary production is performed by chlorophyll-bearing plants ranging from the tiny phytoplankton to the <b>giant</b> <b>kelps</b> {{through the process of}} photosynthesis. Zooplankton play an important role as secondary producers and together with phytoplankton they support the vast assemblages of marine food chain with all their diversity and complexity. Data on chlorophyll pigments, phytoplankton and zooplankton are regarded as a sound basis for environmental appraisal of ecosystems. This paper presents and discusses a set of data collected from the Saudi Arabian coastal waters near the desalination plants in AI-Jubail. Materials were collected from six different sites covering the intake and discharge zones during cruises carried out in 1997 - 98. Analyses of Chlorophyll pigments were made using the spectrophotometric method. Plankton samples were collected using a Nansen plankton net of 75 µ mesh size, and analyzed following standard procedures. Chlorophyll a,b,c and Phaeophytin are the most commonly occurring pigment in seawater. Their concentrations showed wide fluctuation. The phytoplankton community was composed of 35 genera representing the Diatoms, Dinoflagellates and Blue- green algae. Zooplankton was composed of Protozoa, Coelentrata,Ctenophora, Aschelminthes, Annelida, Mollusca, Arthropoda, Echinodermata and Chordata. Arthropoda, represented by Cladocera, Copepoda and Crustacean larvae, formed the largest group followed by Chordata. The distribution of phyto and zooplankton are examined and discussed on a seasonal, annual and inter annual basis. In terms of species, over all species composition has not been affected b...|$|R

50|$|Macrocystis pyrifera, {{commonly}} known as <b>giant</b> <b>kelp</b> or giant bladder kelp, is a species of kelp (large brown algae), and one of four species in the genus Macrocystis. <b>Giant</b> <b>kelp</b> is common {{along the coast of}} the eastern Pacific Ocean, from Baja California north to southeast Alaska, and is also found in the southern oceans near South America, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. Individual algae may grow to more than 45 m long at a rate of as much as 60 cm per day. <b>Giant</b> <b>kelp</b> grows in dense stands known as kelp forests, which are home to many marine animals that depend on the algae for food or shelter. The primary commercial product obtained from <b>giant</b> <b>kelp</b> is alginate, but humans also harvest this species on a limited basis for use directly as food, as it is rich in iodine, potassium, and other minerals. It can be used in cooking in many of the ways other sea vegetables are used, and particularly serves to add flavor to bean dishes.|$|E
30|$|Phytoplankton {{diversity}} in the ocean may influence the functioning of marine ecosystems through overall productivity, nutrient cycling and carbon export (Goebel et al. 2013). The productivity of a specific water body depends {{on the amount of}} plankton present in the same water body (Guy 1992). The plankton growth and distribution depend on the carrying capacity of the environment, availability of the inorganic nutrients and the physico-chemical characteristics of the coastal waters. The nutrient contents in any coastal water determine its potential fertility (Harvey 1960), and the nutrient supply to phytoplankton subsequently enhances the species composition, population abundance, richness and rates of primary production (Hobday et al. 2006). The species composition and abundance of phytoplankton determine the zooplankton diversity and finally affects the fish production as indicated by Schroeder (1983). Variability in primary production may influence the fishery productivity and a strong link between phytoplankton and fisheries variability is proposed by Bainbridge and Mckay (1968) and Cushing (1975). All these factors in turn collectively support the fishery resources of coastal ecosystem. Any changes including depletion of nutrients and biological parameters would therefore affect the health of the coastal ecosystem and alternatively reduce the fish productivity. The knowledge of phytoplankton spatial variations of primary production, nutrient concentration and community structure is fundamental for the understanding of ecosystem dynamics (Bootsma and Hecky 1993). The health of coastal and marine ecosystems is depending upon the primary productivity and productivity potential of the coastal depends upon the primary producers. Although photosynthesis is a key component of the global carbon cycle, its spatial and temporal variability is poorly constrained observationally (Carr et al. 2006). Primary production has been performed by chlorophyll bearing plants ranging from the tiny phytoplankton to the <b>giant</b> <b>kelps</b> through the process of photosynthesis. Phytoplankton alone contributed to about 90.0  % of the total marine primary production (Satpathy et al. 2010). The physical process such as hydrodynamic conditions and current patterns are influencing the primary productivity and determining the phytoplankton’s distribution (Dickie and Trites 1983). Consequently, physical processes that can bring nutrients into the photic zone are of prime importance (Jayasiri and Priyadarshani 2007). Chlorophyll ‘a’ (Chl-‘a’) is a unique parameter that influences the primary productivity of aquatic ecosystems and initiates the marine food chain. In marine ecosystem, Chl-a pigment is closely connected with photosynthesis and playing major role in fishery productivity in coastal and marine waters. Buttler and Tibbits (1972) reported that the Chl-‘a’ above 0.2  mg/l the presence of sufficient fish food to sustain a viable commercial fishery. The hydrographic conditions along the east coast of India undergo significant changes with seasons.|$|R
50|$|An urchin barren {{is an area}} of the subtidal {{where the}} {{population}} growth of sea urchins has gone unchecked, causing destructive grazing of kelp beds or kelp forests (specifically the <b>giant</b> brown bladder <b>kelp,</b> Macrocystis). The transition from kelp forest to barren is defined by phase shifts in which one stable community state is shifted to another. There is a theory that both sea urchin barrens and kelp-beds represent alternative stable states, meaning that an ecosystem can exist under multiple states, each with a set of unique biotic and abiotic conditions (i.e. barren except for urchins or flourishing with kelp). Those who argue for this theory propose several criteria: that different self-replacing communities dominate the site; each state exists longer than one complete turnover of the dominant community or species; and that following a disturbance (e.g. a storm), the system returns to the previous state.|$|R
40|$|In {{marine habitat}} mapping, single beam echo {{sounders}} {{are widely used}} to derive information about the geophysical properties of the seabed, while underwater video can provide supplementary information about the physical structure of the seabed and associated marine biological communities. In this thesis, data from both systems are integrated and used to classify seabed habitats. The habitat classification is based on categories within a hierarchical system that is conducive to information from different instruments or collected at different spatial scales. The classification of single beam echo sounder data {{at different levels of}} the hierarchical classification is the focus {{of the first half of}} the thesis. The first data chapter examines the effect of depth, bottom slope, prevailing weather conditions, and vessel speed on measured acoustic return from the seabed, and the subsequent capacity to classify this data at the substrate level. The following three chapters are case studies that progressively develop techniques for classification of single beam acoustic data at lower levels of the hierarchical classification including identification of soft sediment habitats in commercial scallop fishing grounds; mapping the distribution of urchin barrens on rocky reefs; and detection and mapping of sub-surface <b>giant</b> string <b>kelp,</b> Macrocystis pyrifera. Each of the case studies develops analysis and classification techniques that are applicable for mapping at levels below substrate in the hierarchical classification. At lower levels of the hierarchical classification, biological communities and species distributions are commonly used as habitat descriptors. The second half of this thesis focuses on extracting information from video for the classification of biological communities. In the first of these chapters, methods are compared for extracting estimates of algal cover on temperate rocky reef substrates from towed underwater video. The algal cover data is then used to examine the capacity of a towed video to detect changes in algal community structure at two spatial scales. The following chapter describes the design, construction and evaluation of a stereo video system developed to measure sponge morphological metrics. These metrics are then used to establish a quantitative classification of sponge functional morphology. Differences in sponge functional morphology are examined between sponge communities in two different regions with differences detected in both the composition of functional groups and the size of those functional groups. The thesis presents a framework and methodologies for extracting both physical and biological information from single beam echo sounder and underwater video systems. These methods can easily be incorporated into existing seabed mapping programs, and provide information that will improve our understanding of the spatial distribution of subtidal habitats. This information is directly beneficial to marine resource management, including marine protected area planning and fisheries management, and will allow baseline documentation of habitats for future climate change research...|$|R

40|$|Data about {{breeding}} {{populations of}} {{birds in the}} Antarctica are rare and fragmented. Thus, information {{about the status of}} the breeding populations of Antarctic birds is crucial given the current scenario of climate change, which is particularly acute in Antarctica. This paper presents new information about the populations of the Antarctic tern Sterna vittata, the kelp gull Larus dominicanus, the southern giant petrel Macronectes giganteus, the Antarctic skua Catharacta antarctica lonnbergi, the chinstrap penguin Pygoscelis antarctica and the gentoo penguin Pygoscelis papua on Byers Peninsula (Livingston Island, South Shetland Islands). We used line transects counts to estimate both densities and numbers of nests of the different species. We estimate that there are 398. 96 birds km- 2 of southern giant petrels (2793 individuals), 62. 4 birds km- 2 of Antarctic tern (3746 individuals) and 269. 1 birds km- 2 of kelp gull (1884 individuals). Furthermore, we found 15 nests of Antarctic skua in 25 km 2, from which we can estimate that 60 - 91 birds must breed on Byers Peninsula. We also censused two colonies of gentoo penguins (3000 and 1200 pairs) and 50 pairs of chinstrap. Compared to previous estimates, gentoo penguins seem to have increased whereas chinstrap penguin have decreased. Finally, the populations of Antarctic tern, southern <b>giant</b> petrel and <b>kelp</b> gull have stabilized or slightly increased. Copyright © Antarctic Science Ltd 2013. José A.
