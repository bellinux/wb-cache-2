40|$|The known Rieger {{periodicity}} (ranging {{in literature}} from 150 up to 160 d) is obvious in numerous solar indices. Many subharmonic periodicities {{have also been}} observed (128 -, 102 -, 78 - and 51 -d) in flare, sunspot, radio bursts, neutrino flux and flow data, coined as Rieger-type periodicities (RTPs). Several attempts are focused {{to the discovery of}} their source, as well as the explanation of some intrinsic attributes that they present, such as their connection to extremely active flares, their temporal intermittency as well as their tendency to occur near solar maxima. In this paper, we link the X-ray flare observations made on <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Satellites</b> (GOES) to the already existing theoretical Lou model, suggesting that the mechanism behind the RTPs is the Rossby-type waves.

For our study, we used the monochromatic MgXII Imaging Spectroheliometer (MISH), Full-disk EUV Telescope (FET) and Solar PHotometer in X-rays (SphinX) instruments onboard the Complex Orbital Observations Near-Earth of Activity of the Sun-Photon (CORONAS-Photon) spacecraft because of their high sensitivity in soft X-rays. The peak flare flux (PFF) for solar microflares was found to depend on the strength of the magnetic field and total unsigned magnetic flux as a power-law function. In the spectral range 2. 8 - 36. 6 Å which shows very little increase related to microflares the power-law index of the relation between the X-ray flux and magnetic flux for active regions is 1. 48 ± 0. 86, which is close to the value obtained previously by Pevtsov et al. (Astrophys. J. 598, 1387, 2003) for different types of solar and stellar objects.

The focus of this study will be on CCDs for optical astronomy, astrometry and photometric applications. This study will be of particular interest to GAIA the European Space Agency's (ESA) cornerstone optical astronomy mission to further explore and map sections of our galaxy in greater detail. The results will also have implications for future X-ray astronomy missions like the X-ray Evolving Universe Spectroscopy Mission (XEUS). Both the above missions will require large area focal planes incorporating many CCD detectors. The sources of the instrument background are both solar and galactic and if a probe is launched around the peak in the next solar cycle (2010), the possible false detection rate or the amount of data that could be lost during a mission must be determined.

40|$|Correct {{modeling}} {{of the space}} environment, including radiative forces, is {{an important aspect of}} space situational awareness for geostationary (GEO) spacecraft. Solar radiation pressure has traditionally been modeled using a rotationally-invariant sphere with uniform optical properties. This study is intended to improve orbit determination accuracy for 3 -axis stabilized GEO spacecraft via an improved radiative force model. The macro-model approach, developed earlier at NASA GSFC for the Tracking and Data Relay Satellites (TDRSS), models the spacecraft area and reflectivity properties using an assembly of flat plates to represent the spacecraft components. This 'box-wing' approach has been adapted for the UNIX version of the Goddard Trajectory Determination System (GTDS) at the MIT/Lincoln Laboratory. This thesis presents background and mathematical development of the macro-model approach. This thesis also describes software development and testing, including incorporation of a one-panel spacecraft model along with the full macro-model. A model for Earth albedo and Earth infrared radiation and related software development is also described. Additionally, this thesis gives details about the TDRSS macro-model, and explains the development of a macro-model for the NASA <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Satellites</b> (GOES) I-M spacecraft. Results of simulated data testing using the improved radiative force models are presented. The real data testing detailed in this thesis is an investigation into improving GEO orbit determination using the new force models along with observation data from the Space Surveillance Network (SSN). For the TDRSS spacecraft, HANDS optical observations are used in conjunction with the SSN data. (cont.) NOAA ranging observations are included in some of the tests for the GOES- 10 spacecraft. The space-based visible (SBV) observation model has also been incorporated into GTDS, and SBV observations are included in the orbit determination testing. The tests combine the various types of observation data, and implement various observations corrections and biases. The results of this thesis give {{a better understanding of the}} process of determining precise orbits for GEO spacecraft with the box-wing model and SSN observations. by Richard Harry Lyon.

40|$|Abstract This article {{discusses}} {{statistical models}} for solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions. We analyzed solar flare data in 55 active regions that {{are listed in}} the <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Satellite</b> (GOES) soft X-ray flare catalog for the years from 1981 to 2005. We discuss some problems with a conventional procedure to derive probability density functions from any data set and propose a new procedure, which uses the maximum likelihood method and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) to objectively compare some competing probability density functions. Previous studies on solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions only dealt with constant or time-dependent Poisson process models, and no other models were discussed. We examine three models—exponential, lognormal, and inverse Gaussian—as competing models for probability density functions in this study. We found that lognormal and inverse Gaussian models are more likely models than the exponential model for solar flare interval distribution in individual active regions. Possible mechanisms of solar flare for the distribution models are briefly mentioned. We also investigated a time-dependence of probability density functions of solar flare interval distribution briefly, and found that some active regions show time-dependence for lognormal and inverse Gaussian distribution functions. The results suggest that solar flares do not occur randomly in time; rather, solar flare intervals appear to be regulated by solar flare mechanisms. Determining of a solar flare interval distribution is an essential step in probabilistic solar flare forecasting method in space weather research. We briefly mention a probabilistic solar flare forecasting method as an application of a solar flare interval distribution analysis. The application of our distribution analysis to a probabilistic solar flare forecasting method {{is one of the main}} objectives of this study...|$|E
40|$|The {{work was}} {{presented}} a s a poster on the Monday of the meeting. There {{was a reasonable}} number of visitors to the poster and some useful discussion. Most of the discussion of this event {{took place in a}} session on Tuesday, with two oral presentations. I was a co-author on one of them. Both of them referred to my poster, but of course since it was already gone, this did not help much. I had fruitful discussions with the main authors of both papers. Howard Singer I knew from before and had worked a bit on this with. Bill Denig I had never met and he pointed out some useful information. I will work with Howard in the near future on an article about the event and hope to also follow up with Bill. At the meeting I did not have much time to interact with my main co-authors on this study, who are Chris Russell and Vassilis Angelopoulos of UCLA, both prominent and very busy scientists. Since in any case airfare was lower doing it that way (and covering other expenses form other funds) I came back from San Francisco via Los Angelesand had two working days at UCLA with Chris Russell. This way the groundwork for a basic change in our approach to the event by refocusing on electric fields. We had been trying to publish a general description of the event in prominent journals through the latter part of 2010 and not having much success in getting editors to send out for review (please note that this does not reflect quality but a subjective judgment by the editor on this wide significance. The refocus allowed us to submit to the letters section of Annales Geophysicae and we have submitted there and had the editor send out for review (which we await). The feeling was reinforced at the meeting {{that this is a very}} important event to study. I also attended the THEMIS team meeting at Berkeley and made a brief (and in my opinion not very good) presentation on the event. Luckily, Howard singer made a much better presentation after mine which stimulated discussion, including questions for me. The high degree of interest means at this will be discussed at the next THEMIS team meeting in March. Howard is working on an article on more general aspects and I will contribute that and we will see if that ends up being just one article, or possibly two with me being lead author on one that emphasizes ground magnetic perturbations. On April 5, 2010 around 09 UT, the NOAA <b>Geosynchronous</b> <b>Operational</b> <b>Environmental</b> <b>Satellites</b> (GOES) observed a large reconfiguration of the magnetospheric magnetic field in the midnight to dawn local time sector. Specifically, near midnight, the GOES- 11 Hp (north-south) magnetic field increased by approximately 100 nT in 15 minutes. This is one of the largest dipolarizations of Earth:s field ever observed by GOES. At the same time, there were large increases in the flux of energetic electrons and protons and large ground magnetic perturbations. While the auroral electrojet index (AL) was extreme, being less than - 2000 nT during this event, the preliminary, real-time Dst storm index was only on the order of - 30 nT during the event (although it reached somewhat more intense values during the following day). The Active Magnetosphere and Planetary Electrodynamics Response Experiment (AMPERE) monitored currents at low altitude during this event, and these observations can be used to place the localized measurements at geosynchronous orbit in a global context. Additional measurements were made by the Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms (THEMIS) spacecraft just tailward of the GOES satellites. Minutes after the initiation of this intense substorm, at 0948 UT, Galaxy 15, located at geosynchronous orbit, just a few degrees away from GOES- 11, suffered a serious anomaly and to date, contact has not been restored. At the time, it was reported that this anomaly was likely related to the solar generated event; however, the anomaly is still under investigation. The purpose of this presentation is not to evaluate the anomaly, but rather to describe the large response of the magnetosphere and ionosphere system to the solar and solar wind conditions that caused this extremely large substorm...|$|R
