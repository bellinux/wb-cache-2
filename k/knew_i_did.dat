2500|$|In {{the second}} game of the 2005–06 season, O'Neal injured his right ankle and {{subsequently}} missed the following 18 games. Upon O'Neal's return, Van Gundy resigned, citing family reasons, and Pat Riley assumed head coach responsibilities. Many critics stated that Heat coach Riley correctly managed O'Neal {{during the rest of}} the season, limiting his minutes to a career low. Riley felt doing so would allow O'Neal to be healthier and fresher come playoff time. Although O'Neal averaged career lows (or near-lows) in points, rebounds, and blocks, he said in an interview [...] "Stats don't matter. I care about winning, not stats. If I score 0 points and we win I'm happy. If I score 50, 60 points, break the records, and we lose, I'm pissed off. 'Cause I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> something wrong. I'll have a hell of a season if I win the championship and average 20 points a game." [...] During the 2005–06 season, the Heat recorded only a [...]500 record without O'Neal in the line-up.|$|E
2500|$|I want to {{make this}} {{absolutely}} clear, I never raped anyone. Ever. And the charges of rape were dropped against me back in December [...] Even the state prosecutor involved in this case admitted that he didn't believe I ever raped anyone. The person that made these accusations against me changed her story about what happened that night every single time she told it. So, despite the fact that I never, ever, forced this girl to make out with me, touch me, or anything, {{and despite the fact that}} it was extremely difficult for me to plead guilty to something I absolutely did not do, I chose to take the charge of misdemeanor indecent assault for the sake of avoiding yet more emotional and financial strains on my family, my loved ones, and myself. It's fair to say that the guys in Love Equals Death freaked out when all of this happened. I don't blame them for that – there isn't a guide book to follow in a situation like this. They made it clear to me that they needed to focus on the band and their career as best as they could, and that it would be best for me to focus on my defense. It hurt at the time, but I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> have to focus on defending myself.|$|E
60|$|I thanked my good aunt, in my heart, for her {{tenderness}} towards my wife; and I {{was sure}} that she <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E
6000|$|But at {{this point}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> manage a word in. [...] "I <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it all. It was I who {{suggested}} to Harold that he should lengthen the meditations, and insisted on his inviting Percy to stay." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "The artist's?" [...] I repeated. And I laughed, frantically, wildly, gloomily, incoherently, disagreeably. I am {{sensible}} that <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
60|$|I {{continued}} {{along the}} bridge to the forecastle head and purposely remained there half an hour ere I returned to the cabin {{by way of the}} main deck.

6000|$|... 'I passed {{within five}} {{miles of the}} camp. It {{was in the middle}} of a march, you see, and the carts were {{breaking}} down every few minutes, and I couldn't get 'em over the ground till ten o'clock that night. But I wanted to come awfully. You <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> didn't you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How often, {{when you}} were a girl, have you said to me, with one of your saucy looks--'Mr. Knightley, I am going to do so-and-so; papa says I may, or I have Miss Taylor's leave'--something which, you <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not approve. In such cases my {{interference}} was giving you two bad feelings instead of one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> hardly <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> this--that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> more towards refusing {{him than}} {{accepting}} him; that I must {{have much more}} love for any man <b>I</b> <b>do</b> marry than <b>I</b> have for him at present; and that after what has passed, I think we had better not go to Damascus together." ...|$|R

6000|$|Now we {{were near}} to each other, now I was passing her, I {{who might not}} stay. My hand brushed hers, and oh! {{it was as though}} I had drunk a cup of wine. A spirit entered into me and, bending, I whispered in her ear, {{speaking}} in the Latin tongue, since Greek, which all <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not dare to use, [...] "Ave post secula!" [...] Greeting after the ages! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{arranged}} the ear-piece very carefully, and covered my other ear with my hand. Immediately {{she began to}} speak to me, and every word {{came to me in}} clear and beautiful English! But I knew, as well as I knew that I lived, that the words she spoke were Burmese, or belonged to some other language which she <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not understand. The proof of this was in the words themselves.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not at all; Miss Jardine is not dull. I soon saw she {{understood}} my importance, {{but did not}} mean to use her charm. Her friendliness was marked by some reserve. In fact, it was plain she acknowledged my business was to judge if she were the girl for you and she would not persuade me. Well, I liked her pride, and although we did not talk about it, I rather think she <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> approve." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I?" [...] he replied. [...] "Ah, I {{dare say}} <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> Deuce take me," [...] he added, suddenly, [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> find I am not quite {{unscrewed}} yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My mind is much occupied," [...] he said. [...] "And {{you want}} to know why! Well, sir, I can assure you that not only <b>do</b> <b>I</b> not <b>know</b> why <b>I</b> <b>do</b> these things, but <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not even <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> them. Come to think, it is just as you say; I never have been beyond that field.... And these things annoy you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Dear Laura, you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not ridicule you. You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> {{love you}} for what you are <b>doing.</b> Would not <b>I</b> <b>do</b> the same, and fight for him down to my nails if I had a brother?" ...|$|R
60|$|I felt in peculiarly high spirits, and I {{looked about}} for someone on whom to vent my good humour. I {{caught sight of}} Giulia. I had seen her once or twice since my return to Forli, but had never spoken to her. Now I felt sure of myself; I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not care two straws for her, but I thought it would please {{me to have a}} little revenge. I looked at her a moment. I made up my mind; I went to her and bowed most ceremoniously.|$|E
6000|$|At length {{we reached}} the {{overhanging}} beach; a cottage stood beside the path; we knocked {{at the door and}} it was opened: the bed within instantly caught my eye; something stiff and straight lay on it, covered by a sheet; the cottagers looked aghast. The first words that they uttered confirmed what I before <b>knew.</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not feel shocked or overcome: I believe that I asked one or two questions and listened to the answers. I har[d]ly know, but in a few moments I sank lifeless to the ground; and so would that then all had been at an end! ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not hate her. I had pretended to, but {{the words}} came from the mouth. In my heart I loved her still, more passionately than ever. What did I care if she was heartless and cruel and faithless and vicious! It was nothing to me as long as I could hold {{her in my arms}} and cover her with kisses. I did despise her; I knew her for what she was, but still I loved her insanely. Oh, if she would only come back to me! I would willingly forget {{everything}} and forgive her. Nay, I would ask her forgiveness and grovel before her, if she would only let me enjoy her love again.|$|E

5000|$|The term, [...] "Socratic paradox" [...] {{can also}} {{refer to a}} self-referential paradox, {{originating}} in Socrates' utterance, [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not think <b>I</b> know", often paraphrased as [...] "I <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> nothing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be disturbed, mother; I {{am trying}} to tell you all I think. We were friends, but I imagine Kit knows his {{drawbacks}} from our point of view. Besides, after father quarreled with Peter Askew I never sent Kit a message, and he must have thought I acquiesced. In a way, I did acquiesce; {{it was the best thing}} to be done. You see what this implied? If I had loved him, it meant I had no pluck and was ashamed to acknowledge a farmer's son. But he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not love him and understood that our friendship would not bear the strain of father's disapproval. Either way, it hinted that I was weak and not worth pursuing. Well, he met me without embarrassment and we talked about nothing important. I may meet him now and then, but that, I think, is all." ...|$|E
60|$|I had a double-caped great-coat on, {{and over}} my arm another thick coat. That I got them off, closed with her, threw her down, and got them over her; that I dragged the great cloth {{from the table}} for the same purpose, and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst, and all the ugly things that {{sheltered}} there; that {{we were on the}} ground struggling like desperate enemies, and that the closer I covered her, the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself,--that this occurred I knew through the result, but not through anything I felt, or thought, or <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table, and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air, which, a moment ago, had been her faded bridal dress.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{come from}} the South, where my work lay. One of us they slew by the roadside. Hast thou heard?' Kim shook his head. He, of course, knew nothing of E's predecessor, slain down South {{in the habit of}} an Arab trader. 'Having found a certain letter which I was sent to seek, I came away. I escaped from the city and ran to Mhow. So sure was I that none <b>knew,</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not change my face. At Mhow a woman brought charge against me of theft of {{jewellery}} in that city which I had left. Then I saw the cry was out against me. I ran from Mhow by night, bribing the police, who had been bribed to hand me over without question to my enemies in the South. Then I lay in old Chitor city a week, a penitent in a temple, but I could not get rid of the letter which was my charge. I buried it under the Queen's Stone, at Chitor, in the place known to us all.' ...|$|E

60|$|Richard was now {{seated on}} the stool again, and, the black taking the hind seat, the steeds were put in motion toward home, As they dashed down the hill on a fast trot, the driver {{occasionally}} turned his face to Aggy, and continued speaking; for, notwithstanding their recent rupture, the most perfect cordiality was again existing between them, “This goes to prove that I turned the horses with the reins, for no man who is shot in the right shoulder can have strength enough to bring round such obstinate devils. I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it from the first; but I {{did not want to}} multiply words with Marmaduke about it.—Will you bite, you villain? —hip, boys, hip! Old Natty, too, that is the best of it!—Well, well—’Duke will say no more about my deer—and the Judge fired both barrels, and hit nothing but a poor lad who was behind a pine-tree. I must help that quack to take out the buckshot for the poor fellow.” In this manner Richard descended the mountain; the bells ringing, and his tongue going, until they entered the village, when the whole attention of the driver was devoted to a display of his horsemanship, to the admiration of all the gaping women and children who thronged the windows to witness the arrival of their landlord and his daughter.|$|E
6000|$|... "Three {{years ago}} Mother was very ill--so ill that any shock would kill her, so the doctor Father {{brought from the}} lake told us. A man--a young sea captain--came here to see Father. His name was Frank Harmon and he had known Father well in the past. They had sailed together. Father seemed {{to be afraid of}} him--I had never seen him afraid of anybody before. I could not think much about anybody except Mother then, but I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not quite like Captain Harmon, {{although}} he was very polite to me and I suppose might have been called handsome. One day Father came to me and told me I must marry Captain Harmon. I laughed at the idea at first but when I looked at Father's face I did not laugh. It was all white and drawn. He implored me to marry Captain Harmon. He said if I did not it would mean shame and disgrace for us all--that Captain Harmon had some hold on him and would tell what he knew if I did not marry him. I don't know what it was but it must have been something dreadful. And he said it would kill Mother. I knew it would, and that was what drove me to consent at last. Oh, I can't tell you what I suffered. I was only seventeen and there was nobody to advise me. One day Father and Captain Harmon and I went down the lake to Crosse Harbour and we were married there. As soon as the ceremony was over, Captain Harmon had to sail in his vessel. He was going to China. Father and I came back home. Nobody knew--not even Emily. He said we must not tell Mother until she was better. But she was never better. She only lived three months more--she lived them happily and at rest. When I think of that, I am not sorry for what I did. Captain Harmon said he would be back in the fall to claim me. I waited, sick at heart. But he did not come--he has never come. We have never heard a word of or about him since. Sometimes I feel sure he cannot be still living. But never a day dawns that I don't say to myself, 'Perhaps he will come today'--and, oh--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As a rule he {{said very}} little to me about these subjects, as he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not approve of them, and on this {{occasion}} I did not fail to scold him, and {{to point out the}} folly of being amused by such things, especially at a time when his attention should be occupied with more serious matters. 'Oh, but I have only told you half,' he replied; 'that was just the beginning,' and then {{he went on to say}} that, encouraged by the exactitude of the little girl's description of Madame de Nancre's room, he resolved to put to her a more important question, namely, as to the scene that would occur at the death of the king. The child had never seen any one who was about the court, and had never even heard of Versailles, but she described exactly and at great length the king's bedroom at Versailles and all the furniture which was in fact there at the date of his death. She gave every detail as to the bed, and cried out on recognising, in the arms of Madame de Ventadour, a little child decorated with an order whom she had seen at the house of Mademoiselle la Sery; and again at the sight of M. le duc d'Orleans. From her account, Madame de Maintenon, Fagon with his odd face, Madame la duchesse d'Orleans, Madame la duchesse, Madame la princesse de Conti, besides other princes and nobles, and even the valets and servants were all present at the king's deathbed. Then she paused, and M. le duc d'Orleans, surprised that she had never mentioned Monseigneur, Monsieur le duc de Bourgogne, Madame la duchesse de Bourgogne, nor M. le duc de Berri, inquired if she did not see such and such people answering to their description. She persisted that she did not, and went over the others for the second time. This astonished M. le duc d'Orleans deeply, as well as myself, and we were at a loss to explain it, but the event proved that the child was perfectly right. This seance took place in 1706. These four members of the royal family were then full of health and strength; and they all died before the king. It was the same thing with M. le prince, M. le duc, and M. le prince de Conti, whom she likewise did not see, though she beheld the children of the two last named; M. du Maine, his own (Orleans), and M. le comte de Toulouse. But of course this fact was unknown till eight years after." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I don't want to pain you--you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not,' he {{said more}} gently. 'Only it just exasperates me--this {{you are going}} to <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> wish you would not.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{indifferent}} about it, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{right under}} the same circumstances again." ...|$|R
6000|$|He considered, but he met it. [...] "Ah, but one <b>does</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> at least--and by instinct. I don't fail. That {{will always}} protect me." ...|$|R
