40|$|Operation Unified Protector (Libya, 2011) is {{the latest}} example of how a limited-means {{military}} intervention in a humanitarian crisis can stop the murder of innocent civilians. Proponents of intervention in the name of "responsibility to protect" (R 2 P) have stated that the air campaign strategy used in Libya could be the model for future U. S. military engagement overseas. This begs the question of when the United States should insert itself militarily into a humanitarian crisis. For instance, Syria is a potential candidate for military intervention. The following article takes the reasons for military intervention in Libya, as explained by President Obama in his address to the nation in March 2011, and creates criteria for future humanitarian military intervention. By defining and applying these criteria to a humanitarian crisis such as Syria, it is revealed that the Libya campaign model does not fit Syria now, nor does the model provide a panacea for all future humanitarian crises. While the tenets of the Libya strategy could apply to other humanitarian crises, proponents for military intervention must meet the criteria laid out <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> <b>or</b> the United States may find itself committed to a futile air campaign unable to achieve the nation's strategic objectives...|$|R
5000|$|Toffler {{emphasizes}} {{that any of}} the elements of power can be transformed from one to another such that the individual has the Trinity no matter where they started from. For example, force, like a gun/knife (or silent threat of a gun/knife) can be used to obtain Knowledge (information) or Wealth (money). Wealth can be used to obtain Force, like hiring a hit man or buying poison. Wealth can be used to obtain knowledge, like bribing or buying a book. But ultimately, knowledge is emphasized as the most effective (efficient) way to start off. Through knowledge, like the knowledge <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> <b>or</b> other sources on the internet, methods can be found to obtain Force (ex. connections to the [...] "under world") and Wealth (ex. stock tips). A Wealth of Knowledge is now available on the internet and at the disposal of the user through the finger tips. In particular, information related to cybernetics, the modern word for things like casting voodoo spells is freely found on YouTube and other sources. Cybernetics also relates to other fields like numerology and symbology which are powerful tools for obtaining Force and Wealth. Considering Toffler refers to our civilization and economy based upon symbology, or a [...] "symbolic economy", then this is indeed powerful for any individual.|$|R
40|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{traditional}} prerequisites for a class action have been met, courts have four choices: (1) order the dispute to be resolved in an individualized arbitration, thereby denying plaintiffs either a litigation or arbitration venue for their class claims; (2) refuse to mandate arbitration, and instead allow plaintiffs to litigate their class claims; (3) order that the dispute be resolved through an arbitral class action, also known as classwide arbitration; or (4) order the dispute to arbitration but allow the arbitrators to make the determination {{as to whether the}} dispute should be resolved individually or on a class basis. In short, it is telling that in all of the arbitral class actions that attorneys have discussed with this author, the judge rather than the arbitrators decided all the critical class action issues. When the parties have agreed to a broad arbitration clause, it is not appropriate to exclude an entire class of disputes from arbitration, unless permitting class arbitration would violate constitutional, statutory, or contractual interests. Legislation will be needed to prevent companies from using binding arbitration clauses to eliminate class actions entirely, to the extent we decide it would be undesirable to allow companies to insulate themselves from class actions, {{and to the extent that}} courts fail to accept the statutory and contractual arguments set out <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>Article</b> <b>or</b> elsewhere...|$|R
25|$|Because the pseudonymous authors write from {{perspectives}} {{which are}} not Kierkegaard's own, some of the philosophy mentioned <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> may <b>or</b> may not necessarily reflect Kierkegaard's own beliefs. Just as other philosophers bring up viewpoints in their essays to discuss and criticize them, Kierkegaard assigns pseudonyms to explore a particular viewpoint in-depth, which may take up a whole book or two in some instances, and Kierkegaard, or another pseudonym, critiques that position. For example, the author, Johannes Climacus is not a Christian and he argues from a non-Christian viewpoint. Anti-Climacus, as mentioned earlier, is a Christian to a high degree and he argues from a devout Christian viewpoint. Kierkegaard places his beliefs in-between these two authors.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The aim of <b>this</b> <b>article</b> is the {{parameters}} determination of equipment for measuring temperature fields in air using an infrared camera. This method {{is based on}} the visualization of temperature fields in an auxiliary material, which is inserted into the non-isothermal air flow. The accuracy of air temperature measurement (or of surface temperature of supplies) by this method depends especially on (except for parameters of infrared camera) the determination of the static and the dynamic qualities of auxiliary material. The emissivity of support material is the static quality and the dynamic quality is time constant. Support materials with a high emissivity and a low time constant are suitable for the measurement. The high value of emissivity results in a higher measurement sensitivity and the radiation temperature independence. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> the emissivity of examined kinds of auxiliary materials (papers and textiles) is determined by temperature measuring of heated samples by a calibrated thermocouple and by thermography, with the emissivity setting on the camera to 1 and with the homogeneous radiation temperature. Time constants are determined by a step change of air temperature in the surrounding of auxiliary material. The time constant depends mainly on heat transfer by the convection from the air into the auxiliary material. That is why the effect of air temperature is examined <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> (<b>or</b> a temperature difference towards the environmental temperature) and the flow velocity on the time constant with various types of auxiliary materials. The obtained results allow to define the conditions for using the method of measurement of temperature fields in air during various heating and air conditioning applications. 1...|$|R
