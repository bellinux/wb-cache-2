5000|$|Canada {{laws on the}} {{recognition}} of unmarried cohabitation for legal purposes vary significantly by province/territory; {{and in addition to}} this, federal regulations also have an impact across the country. (see Common-law marriage#Canada) Family formation has undergone significant changes in Canada during the last decades of the 20th century, but the patterns vary widely across the country, suggesting differing cultural norms in different regions. Since the mid 1990s, births to cohabiting parents have increased, particularly in Quebec. In Canada, it is difficult to obtain exact data on the percentage of births outside of marriage, {{due to the fact that}} data on the marital status of mothers is collected differently across the provinces and territories of Canada, and in some (such as Alberta) it is not broken down in detail in regard to whether the mother was legally married or not at the birth of her child. As of 2012, the statistical category of [...] "single mothers"(defined as never married at the time of the birth) encompassed 28.3% of mothers, the category [...] "divorced" [...] (i.e. mothers who were unmarried at the time of birth, but had been previously married during their lives) encompassed 1%, while for 10% of mothers the marital status was unknown ("not stated").There are, however, very significant differences by province/territory; for example in 2012, 77.8% of births in Nunavut were listed to [...] "single mothers", by contrast, less than 20% of mothers in Ontario were listed in this category. Latest data from the Quebec Statistical Institute shows that as of 2015, in Quebec, 63% of children were born to unmarried women. In Canada, legal issues regarding cohabitation are very complicated by the fact that family law in this regard differs by province/territory, which is very confusing to the public, especially as this contrasts to criminal law which is the same across Canada, as well as to marriage and divorce law, which is also the same across the country, under the 1986 Divorce Act (Canada) (although provinces/territories have jurisdiction over some marital issues, including the solemnization of marriage, spousal and child support, and property division). The marital status of Canadians also varies by province/territory: in 2011, 46.4% of the population aged 15 and over was legally married; ranging from the lowest percentage of married people being in Nunavut (29.7%), Northwest Territories (35.0%), Quebec (35.4%), and Yukon (37.6%); to highest being in Newfoundland and Labrador (52.9%), Prince Edward Island (51.7%), Ontario (50.3%) and Alberta (50.2%). While today Quebec is known for liberal family formation and cohabitation, this is a recent development: during the first half of the 20th century, family life in the province was conservative and strongly dominated by Roman Catholicism; before 1968, there was no provincial divorce legislation in Quebec, and spouses could only end their marriage if they obtained a private Act of Parliament. One of the explanations of the current high rates of cohabitation in Quebec is that the traditionally strong social control of the church and the Catholic doctrine over people's private relations and sexual morality has led the population to rebel against traditional and conservative social values. While some provinces were early to modernize family law, in others this only happened in the 1990s and the 21st century, such as in Alberta, through the Family Law Act (Alberta) which came into force in 2005. This Act overhauled <b>family</b> <b>legislation,</b> replacing the Domestic Relations Act, the Maintenance Order Act, the Parentage and Maintenance Act, and parts of the Provincial Court Act and the Child, Youth and Family Enhancement Act, which were seen as outdated. Also, the Adult Interdependent Relationships Act (S.A. 2002, c. A-4.5) amended 69 Alberta laws. The Canadian Prairies provinces of Manitoba and Saskatchewan have strong common-law spouses regulations, imposing rights and obligations on common-law couples. Nova Scotia has also been very slow to advance family law - it was only in 1999 that this province abolished discrimination against [...] "illegitimate" [...] children with regard to inheritance (through section 16 of NS Intestate Succession Act amended in 1999). In general, today, provinces in Western Canada give more rights to common-law spouses than those in Atlantic Canada and in Quebec. This may seem quite paradoxical, because it is the eastern provinces which have the strongest tradition of cohabitation; according to a study [...] "unmarried cohabitation seems to be more common in Eastern Canada than in Western Canada, which might be related to internal and international migration". (as of 2012, 48% of births in New Brunswick, 47.1% in Newfoundland and Labrador, and 45.2% in Nova Scotia, were listed to [...] "single mothers", way above the national average). In British Columbia, the Family Law Act came into force in 2013.|$|E

All four European nations have been concerned with promoting childbearing and assisting parents to balance work and family responsibilities. They have also increased national responsibility for the care and education of children ages 3 - 5 and employer responsibility for parental leave. In contrast to the state-run systems in France, the United States has a market-based system with middle- and upper-income parents making the choices and being reimbursed by the state for part of those expenses. Low-income parents receive targeted subsidies. Recent parental leave legislation brings the United States only slightly closer to Europe because the leave is unpaid...|$|E

40|$|Family' {{remains a}} site of ideological struggles. What {{constitutes}} a family and who can become/have/define a family {{is a matter of}} ongoing political and other debates and discourses.

The problem became generalized however, and schools were seen as having a responsibility in recognizing and referring children who evidenced a much broader range of characteristics than those originally associated with the battered child syndrome.

40|$|Purpose of this paper: To {{demonstrate}} how traditional definitions of family, {{in the context}} of employment, have not kept pace with actual family formation in the U. S. and {{much of the rest of}} the world, and how this disadvantages individuals from atypical (i. e., non-nuclear), but increasingly common, families. Design/methodology/approach: A wide range of literature from disciplines spanning industrial relations, gerontology, management, and family studies is invoked to illustrate how employers’ definitions of “family” are often incompatible with actual contemporary family structures, and how this poses difficulties for employed individuals in non-traditional families. Findings: Many family structures are not accounted for by employment legislation and thus organizational work-family policies. These include same-sex couples, multi-generational and extended families (e. g., including parents or other elders; members from outside the bloodline or with grandparents providing primary care for grandchildren) and virtual families. Practical implications (if applicable) : We discuss a number of problems associated with current provision of work-family policy and practice among organizations, and recommend that governments and organizations expand upon the traditional definition of “family” to better enable employees in a variety of familial configurations to successfully balance their work and family demands. What is original/value of paper: This paper identifies current failings in employment legislation and suggests improvements so that both governments and organizations can better facilitate employees’ work-life balance. As such, it will be of use researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers interested in the interface between work and family.

40|$|The {{following}} article {{deals with}} the challenges created by legal regulations concerning divorced or separated couples and focuses {{on the rights of}} separated parents with children. The article analyzes the problems associated with law enforcement practices in this area, the gaps in existing family law, as well as the disputed aspects of theory concerning parents ’ legal relations. Suggestions for legislative developments in Russia concerning the protection of family rights within separated families are given. The authors of this paper argue for a rethink of existing approaches to legal regulations in this field of law {{due to the fact that}} existing <b>family</b> <b>legislation</b> does not take into consideration many of the challenges and realities of modern parenthood. Furthermore, current legal regulations in Russia do not fully correspond to international legal norms. The authors contend that this will lead to the curtailment of the legal rights of the separated parents. Such status is characterized, on the one hand, by unreasonable restrictions on parental rights. On the other hand, it permits only a limited degree of responsibility for a child’s upbringing and financial support on the part of a parent living separately from their child. The authors propose that, in this respect, it is necessary to rethink disputed legal decisions relating to family law and the implementation of family law in practice. By analyzing such implementation, the authors single out a number of interrelated factors that must be overcome in order to effectively protect separated parents’ relationships with their children. The aim of the article is to initiate a new approach to parental legal relations after divorce or separation and to propose new legislative regulations concerning the legal status of a parent who lives separately from their child. New developments in family law are proposed in order to ensure a balance between parental responsibilities and rights as well as the rights of the child. </p...|$|E

40|$|Morocco is oftentimes {{praised by}} academics, {{development}} workers, and women’s rights activists as a trailblazer for {{the empowerment of}} women in the Middle East and North African region. Its reforms in the realm of <b>family</b> <b>legislation</b> and progress made in human development place the country at the helm of liberalising Arab Muslim-majority societies, even more so after the Arab Spring and Morocco’s peaceful transition to a ‘new’ constitutional order. However, a closer look at women’s rights discourses, legal reforms, its texts and implementation, and the public attitudes towards the enhancement of women’s rights reveals a less empowering situation. The purported goals of the Family Code, as the extolled document showcasing Morocco’s attempt at ameliorating (married) women’s rights, of ‘doing justice to women’ while ‘preserving men’s dignity’ mask the reformed law’s reconsolidation of patriarchal family relations. Many legal grey areas within this particular law, as well as clashing principles emanating from other laws such as the Penal Code, allow judges and the ʿaduls (religious notaries) to exercise discretion and apply the law as they see fit and, to a large extent, as it conforms to their and the community’s vision of the ideal moral order. Moreover, because ‘doing justice to women’ affects men’s and family’s honour, the project of the enhancement of women’s rights has had as a result retraditionalisation of family relations and hierarchical gender structures. Nowhere is this more poignant than in the status of educated single adult girls from provincial areas. They may be poster girls for the development community, but they are pitied by their own communities because they fail to become complete women––married (non-employed) mothers. The story of Morocco’s professed progress is a story of empowering its citizens, but one which does so on paper only. It is also a story which hides the salient details of poorly written reformed laws, obstructed access to justice, continuing widespread misogyny, material poverty and social marginalisation, and cohesive socio-economic programmes, which are rarely followed through.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} {{new emphasis on}} childhood in France {{that came from the}} destructiveness and trauma of the First World War. After the Great War, the French sought to rebuild their nation by redefining both young people 2 ̆ 7 s social responsibilities and adults 2 ̆ 7 duties towards children. Politicians, educators, scientists, a social activists sought greater control over what seemed to be an increasingly valuable and potentially volatile social group. From 1918 to 1949, I argue, in public debates about the fashioning of a new, post-war youth culture, traditionalist, idealist, and scientific conceptions of childhood were competing alternatives. Each of these ways of thinking and talking about the social and cultural role of the next generation expressed different visions of the French nation in response to national crisis. Through the schools, <b>family</b> <b>legislation,</b> and leisure culture such as youth groups and the children 2 ̆ 7 s press, the younger generation assumed a new social and cultural position. French youth began {{to be seen as a}} national community, set apart by their age status from the rest of society, yet reflecting patriotic ideals and deeply-rooted French values. The new and distinct youth culture developed as part of post-war recovery served to mediate young people 2 ̆ 7 s relationship the nation, circumventing the earlier primacy of family relationships as the basis for social identity. During this time, French children were pulled out of the more private space of the family. This increased the sense of the power of youth as a collective entity, which also contributed to new fears of youth rebellion. These underlying tensions, between tradition and science and between heroism and rebellion, also led to the implementation of official regulation of French youth culture, notably through the passage in 1949 of a law censoring children 2 ̆ 7 s periodicals. Throughout this period, with state support, scientific theories gained the greatest authority over constructing the French child 2 ̆ 7 s world, but this new public space retained a deep-seated connection to adult-envisioned national ideals. In reforming the role of the younger generation after the war, the French found grounds for hope and national rejuvenation. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{addresses the}} following questions: Which are the leitmotifs underlying the social-democratic understanding {{of marriage and}} family? What are the historical developments, modifications and changes which these motifs underwent during more than one-hundred years from 1863, when the SPD was founded, until 2005, {{the beginning of the}} so-called Great Coalition ? Did the social-democratic leitmotifs of marriage and family succeed in becoming leitbilders accepted by the community? If yes: under which political and social framework and within which constellation of participating actors does the change from leitmotif to leitbild take place? In its nucleus, the social-democratic understanding is composed of three leitmotifs: i) equal rights for men an women in marriage and family, ii) an extended understanding of the definition of family which encompasses different types of familial life, and iii) marriage as a secular private contract of loving together with other forms of cohabitation being of equal value. Since leitbilders develop in public discourse about values and rules, the sources used in this dissertation are analysed by the method of sociological discourse analysis and, with respect to their content, allocated to a frame of a family leitbild. This work focuses on relevant discursive events in the area of matrimonial and <b>family</b> <b>legislation.</b> Discourse careers and the development of social-democratic leitmotifs to leitbilder are essentially presented chronologically {{along the lines of the}} creation of the German Civil Code (1900), the Weimar Constitution (1919), the Basic Law of the German Federal Republic (1949), the First Equal Rights Law (1957), the reform of the Illegitimacy Law (1969), the reform of the Marital and Family Law (1977) and the Life-Partnership Law (2001 / 2005). The analysis demonstrates constant efforts of the SPD in the historical context to have its leitmotifs accepted and codified, in most cases against the zeitgeist, against a conservative-bourgeois majority, against the dogmatic teaching of the churches and fraught with the dilemma of system competition with the German Democratic Republic (DDR). During its time in power, the SPD takes the chance to embody the principles of its marriage and family leitmotifs in the legislation. Through social changes, but also by the political fight of the SPD for its leitmotifs, these have now become socially accepted leitbilders...|$|E
