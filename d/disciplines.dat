5|$|For {{purposes}} of Pan American Games competition, the Pan American Sports Organization (PASO) makes {{a distinction between}} sports and <b>disciplines.</b> A sport, in Pan American Games terms, is a single or group of <b>disciplines</b> as represented by an international governing body, namely an International Federation. For example, aquatics, represented at the Olympic level by the International Swimming Federation, is a sport at the Pan American Games that includes the swimming, diving, synchronized swimming and water polo <b>disciplines.</b>|$|E

5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be done as part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other <b>disciplines</b> {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other <b>disciplines</b> to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other <b>disciplines.</b> On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E

One hundred and three parents appraised their ways of children <b>disciplining,</b> their attitudes towards the ways of <b>disciplining,</b> the context of experiencing, modes of implementing <b>discipline</b> and ways of <b>disciplining</b> of their mother and father when they were 10 years old.

5|$|Each clan has {{specific}} <b>Disciplines,</b> {{which can}} be used in combat and to create approaches to quests. Although some powers overlap clans, no two clans share the same three <b>Disciplines.</b> More physical vampires can enhance themselves to become fast and lethal killers or summon spirit allies to attack their foes; others can mentally dominate their targets to force their cooperation or render themselves invisible to hide from detection; and others can boil their opponent's blood from afar. Some <b>Disciplines,</b> such as Auspex (which boosts perception, highlighting other characters' auras through obstacles) and Blood Buff (which temporarily upgrades strength, dexterity, stamina and lockpicking), are common to all vampires. Several abilities can be active at the same time. Blood is a primary currency in Bloodlines, used to activate <b>Disciplines</b> and abilities. It is drained with each use, and can be replenished by drinking from rats, visiting blood banks or drinking from humans by attacking or seducing them; the player can feed on enemies during combat. Drinking from innocents for too long can kill them, costing a character humanity points.|$|E

5|$|Another {{difficult}} area was feats. Although common feats worked well, with a random {{chance of success}} or failure, uncommon ones would appear to fail more often. To avoid this, randomization {{was replaced by a}} degree of difficulty in accomplishing the feat. Although pen-and-paper falling damage is random, the computer game bases damage on the distance of the fall. The team's biggest challenge was adapting <b>disciplines.</b> The pen-and-paper version may require a little blood that requires a long time to use, or have no blood cost and can be used at will; upgraded <b>disciplines</b> had additional requirements considered too confusing for a computer game. Troika attempted to equalize the <b>disciplines,</b> keeping the effect intact and normalizing the cost, so a first-level power requires one blood point, a second-level two points and so on. To balance the clans, the aristocratic Ventrue were only allowed to feed on noble blood, though this was changed to allow them to feed on lower-class humans, receiving less blood. During character creation, the game had an optional character biography with unique positive and negative characteristics (increasing one ability while limiting another). This was removed from the released game; Activision felt that there was insufficient test time, and removing it was a more stable option.|$|E
