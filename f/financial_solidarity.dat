Although, there is a direct influence from political actors to determine the policy, decisions processes, objectives and methods should be made within the partnership programme.

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1990 s, health service reforms were implemented in public health institutions in most African countries South of the Sahara. In the Ivory Coast, the imposition of user fees for public services was adopted in 1994. Such fees require each person to have adequate financial resources in order to access modern health care services. Many poor people [...] despite their poverty [...] are able to access modern health care services that have become quite expensive. The factor that allows this access lies within the solidarity of parents, friends or members of a social network. In Africa, illness is a social phenomenon and a state of illness is negative. The sick human being is one who cannot fully participate in community life. The treatment of a sick person is, then, an act, which is tied to the systems of life, which are produced and maintained collectively. Once the causes of illness are identified and consequences evaluated, it is the entire family or group that participates in the finances which bring about treatment. In this study, we show the role of social capital in the processes of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> for access to modern health care services that now require payment. Our investigation provides valuable insights on the role of social capital with respect to social strategies and community financing mechanisms for the acquisition of modern health care in Africa.

This article analyses the experience of mutuals in the Netherlands over the past 20 years.

Results illustrate that mutuals are well equipped to insure risks that are uninsurable in the commercial market. This {{is especially true for}} animal and crop disease risks. Mutuals are furthermore able to fulfil the EU conditions for receiving premium support hence opening up the opportunity for farmers to insure against multi-peril weather risks. Experience has however demonstrated that mutuals are not always successful, even with substantial public support. Lack of members caused several mutuals to be discontinued only a few years after their foundation. In order to secure the benefits of mutuals, it is shown {{that there is a need}} to carefully balance size of risk, affordability of premiums, <b>financial</b> robustness and <b>solidarity.</b> These issues are even more important in the case of mutuals providing income stabilisation tools as these have the added responsibility of data and (classified) market information management...|$|R

This raises the question whether financial gifts to and from friends and to and from family are related. Do people give more to their friends if they give less to their children? Or, are people who receive money from one relation {{also more likely to}} receive money from others? And, does the relationship with friends change when people have children? In this paper we explore the simultaneity of the transfers from and to children and friends to improve our understanding of the motives for <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity.</b> To this aim we use data from Netherlands Kinship Panel Study 2005 in which respondents (here called anchors), reported transfers from and to their children and friends. We first relate these financial transfers to individual characteristics of both the anchor and respective donors or beneficiaries and secondly investigate the correlations between each pairs of transfers for the main sample and different sub-groups. Our findings suggest that there exist a strong correlation between transfers from and to both children. A similar though less strong correlation is found when comparing relationships with children and friends simultaneously. In contrast with parent-child relationships we find a strong tendency for reciprocity between friends. With the increase of number of children reported, the reciprocity of the anchors towards their friends declines. The findings support ‘warm glow ’ related motives, and do not support the altruism hypotheses as an explanation for <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity.</b> ...|$|E

In recent years, such a situation has confronted the traditionally poorer states of Western Germany and the traditionally poorer nations of the European Union. Both have had to worry that systems of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> that benefited them in the past might change to benefit a new set of potential (and arguably needier) recipients. In the German case, reforms of the tax equalization system might channel funds to the new eastern Länder while in the EU case, reforms of the structural funds might channel funds to states in Central and Eastern Europe. It turns out that funding was generous in the East German case but decidedly not in the CEE case. Why? Neither partisanship nor feelings of solidarity towards these “poor cousins” seem to have much explanatory purchase. Rather, the strong institutional positions of the traditionally poorer states in both cases, meant that the key factors shaping the outcomes are the electoral exposure of the respective central governments and the presence or absence of hard budget constraints on that political center.

40|$|The {{regional}} development policy of European Union deals with spatial localisation {{of production and}} affects the daily life of {{more than half of}} the 500 million persons living in the European Union. Conceived at European level as a solidarity policy, it bases especially on <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> through the distribution of a part of the European budget obtained through the contribution of Member States to the less prosper social categories and regions. Regional development policy of European Union for the programming period 2007 - 2013 is based on the diversity, opportunities and challenges offered by the regions in Europe. It puts into practice the solidarity between European nations and focuses on a fundamental objective: strengthening the economic, social and territorial cohesion through diminishing the development discrepancies between its regions. The present paper identifies the new directions of the European {{regional development}} policy and aims to highlight the importance of this policy for the economic growth and development of Romania.

40|$|The {{institutional}} framework and the tools for economic governance {{provided by the}} Treaty of Lisbon were inadequate for preventing or resolving the recent banking and sovereign debt crisis in the EU. For instance, the Treaty did not provide any instruments for stabilizing euro area finances, and the existing economic governance instruments, such as the Stability and Growth Pact or the Broad Economic Policy Guidelines, were not applied adequately by the Member States. In addition, the institutional decision-making procedures foreseen by the Treaty proved too sluggish during the crisis. Therefore, most of the measures taken to remedy the situation were agreed through intergovernmental decision-making, with the European Council evolving as the key player in the governance process, rather than through standard EU procedures (with the “Community Method”). The deepening of euro governance, alongside the EU governance framework, resulted {{from the fact that}} the euro area required a coherent and efficient economic governance structure. The willingness to offer <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> within the euro area correlates with the willingness of distressed Member States to implement sustainable national fiscal policies.

With the opening of a new round of negotiations over the next multi-annual financial perspectives for the period 2007 - 2013, in a context of slow growth, competing objectives and tight financial situations in most EU 15 member states, the future size and composition of the European budget are open to debate and the choices that have to be made will, to a large extent, shape the future of the common policies and of the existing instruments of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity,</b> with likely consequences on economic growth and its distribution amongst member states.

It then extends the analysis to broader considerations about common policies, most notably the Common agricultural policy (CAP) and the structural and regional policies, and collective goods for the EU, and about the various institutional and budgetary arrangements, as well as sources of financing, that may be contemplated to implement European policies or to achieve common objectives by means of a more decentralized budgetary system.

40|$|The {{recurrent}} {{crises in}} the EMS have bolstered a lively {{debate about the}} transition to EMU. Indeed {{the political economy of}} regional integration is at odds with the theory of optimum currency areas. Essentially static and based on real criteria alone, the latter is not suited to deal with a process which has historical roots, political ends, real and nominal dimensions. The relevant concept is convergence.; Part I first discusses the interplay of nominal and real convergence, then examines the structural and behavioural asymmetries between European countries. It shows why convergence is not the outcome of spontaneous market mechanisms. Resting on deep-rooted asymmetries, market forces interfere with ill-conceived policies to induce a divorce between nominal and real convergence. Three types of asymmetries, which raise concern for the transition to EMU, are highlighted: the conditions of competitiveness, the disparities in the transmission of monetary policies, the difficulties of fiscal consolidation.; Part II draws lessons from the structural analysis which enables us to define the principles and the operational procedures of a workable transition. Three principles are emphasized: self-selection of countries respective to EMU membership according to their own convergence paths; achievement of the highest stability of exchange rates compatible with the progress of real convergence; compliance with the institutional procedures written down in the Treaty. These principles have strong operational consequences: the emergence of a hard core working as a stable center to guarantee the coherence of multiple transitions; the set-up of a two-tier exchange rate arrangement within the wide bands; the strengthening of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> and monetary co-responsibility within the hard core.

40|$|This paper {{proposes to}} {{evaluate}} {{the heart of the}} concept of citizenship of the European Union: namely, freedom of movement and residence. The evolution of citizenship, from its inception in the Maastricht Treaty, as a political concept will be treated. Freedom of movement and residence, with its rights and limitations, historically and legally accrued to economically active persons. Non-economically active persons have been given rights in secondary legislation to move and to reside subject to specified conditions and limitations. The jurisprudence of the European Court of Justice, in accordance with which the link with economic in dependence and the freedom to move and reside has been broken, will be critically appraised. Resort to the principle of non discrimination on grounds of nationality in Article 12 of the European Community Treaty, read in conjunction with the citizenship provisions in Articles 17 and 18 EC, has resulted in legal rights for nationals of European Union Member States who are lawfully resident in, and who do not become an unreasonable burden on, the host Member State. Enforceable at the suit of individuals, EU citizenship has given rise to social advantages for non-economic actors. Citizenship has become a legal source of rights be yond those agreed to by the Member States, the legitimacy for which lies with the degree of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> accorded under the principle of non-discrimination and the level of integration of a particular EU citizen into the society of the host Member State. The need to establish a real link and the proportionate legitimate interests of the Member State are limits to citizenship as a source of rights. Nevertheless, it is the intention of this paper to examine the potential for citizenship to transform the polity of the European Union, from one based on economic and social rights, to one based on fundamental right...|$|E
40|$|The {{paper offers}} a {{rational}} {{explanation for the}} notorious inefficient farm support policies within the EU with an optimization model of legislative behavior and legislative institutions. It is argued that inefficient agricultural policies can be rationally explained if {{it is assumed that}} legislative decision making is determined by informal norms derived in the shadow of formal institutional rules. First, maximization of political support implies that different institutional actors do prefer different levels of subsidization for the different national farm sectors. Second, according to the applied specific decision norm legislators' preferred policy positions are aggregated to a specific Common Agricultural Policy. In the formal model informal norms correspond to a specific organization of political exchange, where on a macro level legislators exchange political rights to control policies in specific policy domains, and on a micro level within a policy domain network political control rights are exchanged over specific policy dimensions. Beside the importance of the "principle of ministry government", that is political control rights over agricultural policies are generally obtained by actors that are politically strongly related to the farm sector, the model emphasizes the impact (1) of external effects of political exchange and (2) of the principle of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> on the efficiency of CAP. Since the foundation of the EU norms have been changed from less efficient norms, i. e. the Luxembourg Compromise corresponding to Weingast's norm of a universal coalition, to more efficient norms reflecting qualified majority voting within the Council. Observed changes of norms are interpreted as legislators choosing {{the rules of the game}} maximizing their expected benefits, where the enlargement of the EU is identified as a main factor forcing legislators uniquely to choose new norms...|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on political economy analyses of agricultural protection mainly {{focus on the}} impact of economic and demographic structures on the level of agricultural protection (Tyers/Anderson 1992, Swinnen 1994, Rausser et al. 1974), although it is commonly accepted that beyond economic and demographic structures political institutions do {{have an impact on the}} political power of different interest groups and hence on agricultural policy output (Gardner 1987 as well as Binswanger et al. 1997). The impact of political institutions, e. g. the organization of legislature, election and party systems, on agricultural protection has hardly been taken into account explicitly in theoretical and empirical studies, yet. In this framework the paper investigates to what extent political institutions explain observed variances in the political power of the agrarian population in the ten Central and Eastern European Countries/Candidates (CEEC) applying for an accession of the EU. Moreover, it is analyzed to what extent EU-accession will be politically feasible given the specific political and economic framework conditions of the individual states. In particular, empirical analyses imply the following results: (i) the political power of the agrarian population varies significantly among the analyzed countries ranging from a relative low political weight of 0. 115 of the agrarian population in Lativa up to an absolute political dominance of the agrarian population in Slovenia given a weight of 0. 887. (ii) The political weights are significantly determined by political institutions. In particular, the more the election systems corresponds to a proportional representation and the more the parliamentary organization allows for a specialized representation of agrarian interests, e. g. bicameralism where a second chamber representing regional interests, and the more efficient the organization of agrarian interests, e. g. existence of a peasent party, the higher is the political weight of the agrarian population. (iii) Analyzing to what extent EU-accession is politically feasible in the CEEC-states we can show that, assuming national financing of EU-policy, EU-accession would be hardly politically feasible in any CEEC-countries. An exception might be seen in Slovenia. Thus political feasibility of EU-accession crucially depends on keeping the rule of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity.</b> Moreover, assuming a comprehensive pre-accession CAP-reform will take place, possible options to achieve political feasibility in the CEEC-states under these conditions would be undertaking constitutional reforms. In particular, the implementation of electorate system corresponding closer to a proportional representation or the establishment of bicameralism would be, at least theoretically, possible options.

40|$|Abstract editor: European Union law has {{developed}} a concept of Union citizenship based on a right of exit from one’s country and a consequential right of entry in another Member State of the Union. ‘Empowering’ European citizens and enabling them to integrate into other Member States’ territories is its main purpose. If we seek to analyse further the concept of Union citizenship, it is almost inevitable that we inquire into the social background of this construction, the individual skills and resources it entails, the state structures and collective goods it affects. This is the puzzle with which the most acute commentators engage. Looked at this way, Union citizenship is about integration of Union citizens into national communities, <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> with other Member States’ nationals and recognition of their personal identities. Ultimately it is about transnational integration and new forms of social justice within the Member States. There is, however, another way to engage with the concept. The focus on social integration {{is replaced by a}} somewhat more ambitious project: to empower the Union citizens to connect with Europe as a whole. This approach assumes that a proper regime of Union citizenship constitutes not only a right to free movement but a right to enjoy a common way of living. It would allow Union citizens to live, at least partially, in social and moral conditions which denote a far-reaching European society. If we take this project seriously, the problem, then, is as follows: {{how are we going to}} shape this project within a conceptual framework based on transnational integration? What does it mean practically to create ties between individuals who have been allowed to disaffiliate from their country of origin? To which ‘whole’ shall we refer that is not a structured state and yet does not boil down to a mere sphere of individual interests and particular social interactions? The essays presented here suggest two ways to approach this problem. The first explores the concept of ‘the territory of the Union’ enshrined in the EU legal discourse as a possible venue for this shift in understanding the project of European citizenship. The second approach tells the story of an individual who feels strongly about being a ‘European’ with the right to be recognized everywhere in Europe without being part of any definite community. The first paper is an academic article which was commissioned by Dimitry Kochenov for a forthcoming edited volume on EU Citizenship and Federalism: The Role of Rights (CUP, 2015). The second is more of a narrative or a tale and is written in French. The first essay builds upon the second. The reason for bringing them together is to show that the literary form may contribute to an understanding of complex legal issues simply by showing a state of legal affairs in its most stylised form. ...|$|E

Moreover, it is analyzed to what extent EU-accession will be politically feasible given the specific political and economic framework conditions of the individual states. In particular, empirical analyses imply the following results: (1) the political power of the agrarian population varies significantly among the analyzed countries ranging from a relative low political weight of 0. 115 of the agrarian population in Latvia up to an absolute political dominance of the agrarian population in Slovenia given a weight of 0. 887. (2) The political weights are significantly determined by political institutions. In particular, the more the election systems corresponds to a proportional representation and the more the parliamentary organization allows for a specialized representation of agrarian interests, e. g. bicameralism where a second chamber representing regional interests, and the more efficient the organization of agrarian interests, e. g. existence of a peasant party, the higher is the political weight of the agrarian population. (3) Analyzing to what extent EU-accession is politically feasible in the CEEC we can show that, assuming national financing of EU-policy, EU-accession would be hardly politically feasible in any CEEC-countries. An exception might be seen in Slovenia. Thus political feasibility of EU-accession crucially depends on keeping the principle of <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity.</b> Moreover, assuming a comprehensive pre-accession CAP-reform will take place, possible options to achieve political feasibility in the CEEC under these conditions would be undertaking constitutional reforms. In particular, the implementation of electorate system corresponding closer to a proportional representation or the establishment of bicameralism would be, at least theoretically, possible options. ' (author's abstract) Der vorliegende Beitrag untersucht, in welchem Ausmass politische Institutionen beobachtete Abweichungen der politischen Macht der landwirtschaftlichen Bevoelkerung in den zehn zentral- und osteuropaeischen Laendern erklaeren koennen, die der Europaeischen Union beitreten moechten. Darueber hinaus wird analysiert, in welchem Ausmass der Zugang zur EU durchfuehrbar ist, wenn die spezifischen politischen und oekonomischen Rahmenbedingungen zu Grunde gelegt werden. Empirische Analysen fuehren zu folgenden Resultaten: (1) die politische Macht der landwirtschaftlichen Bevoelkerung schwankt in den untersuchten Laendern erheblich und reicht von einem relativ niedrigen politischen Gewicht in Lettland bis zu einer absoluten politischen Dominanz in Slowenien. (2) Das politische Gewicht wird erheblich von den politischen Institutionen determiniert. Je mehr die Wahlsysteme einer proportionalen Repraesentation entsprechen, je mehr die parlamentarische Organisation eine Darstellung der landwirtschaftlichen Interessen zulaesst und je effizienter die agrarischen Interessensorganisationen arbeiten, desto mehr politisches Gewicht ist vorhanden. (3) Es wird deutlich, dass fuer einige Laender eine EU-Mitgliedschaft politisch kaum durchfuehrbar ist. Eine Ausnahme koennte Slowenien darstellen. Die politische Moeglichkeit des EU-Zuganges haengt aber entscheidend vom Aufrechterhalten der Grundregel der finanziellen Solidaritaet ab.

40|$|Although the European Court of Justice has {{sometimes}} even {{been called the}} "motor of integration" and {{the driving force of}} integration that influences the level of integration through its case law, this notion has not been commonly adopted and accepted by all theoretical approaches dealing with European integration. Debates on the ways how the role and influence of the Court of Justice on the EU integration process should be interpreted are still topical. The choice of subject for this Bachelor's thesis is {{based on the fact that}} the free movement of students in the EU and studies in other Member States have become such a common part of everyday life that the author of the thesis became interested in finding out whether and which changes have taken place in connection with the rights of students. The subject of the thesis is topical as the number of students who use the opportunity to move freely in the EU area without internal borders and to study in another Member State has statistically been growing yearly. The aim of the Bachelor's thesis was to analyse the influence of the Court of Justice on the integration level of the European Union and to find an answer to the question whether and in which cases the decisions of the Court of Justice can influence this integration level. The thesis concentrated on the analysis of the rights of students and the European Communities’ competence for education and the role of the Court of Justice in this process. The thesis posed the following hypothesis: the European Court of Justice has a dominant effect on the integration level of the European Union, but this is true only if the Member States lack a common position on the issue brought before the Court of Justice. The empirical data comprised five of the most important rulings of the Court of Justice on students' rights, which were also referred to most frequently in specialised literature. The aim of the methodological framework created for analysing the empirical data and of the analysis was to determine which of the integration theories dealt with in the thesis, i. e. neofunctionalism or liberal intergovernmentalism, better explains European integration. The empirical analysis was carried out separately for each case, but the analysed data were compared to test the hypothesis, and general conclusions were drawn on this basis. The results of the analysis did not confirm the hypothesis of the thesis and the influence of the Court of Justice on the integration level had to be affirmed even in situations where the Member States had a common position which was almost without exception contrary to the opinion of the Court of Justice on the specific issue. The ruling of the Gravier case showed that the Court of Justice does not allow Member States to dictate the way how to interpret Community law or how to define a specific term (in this case the term "vocational training") in Community law. Basically the court stated in the Gravier ruling that the possibilities for obtaining education and internships and participation in studies are regulated by Community law, which is why it is forbidden to discriminate against students from other Member States on the basis of citizenship, which also applies to prescribing an enrolment fee as a precondition to being admitted to a vocational training course. The court ruling in the Blaizot case where the Court found that the term "vocational training" does not exclude university education and extended this term on certain conditions also to university studies was one step forward in increasing integration in the field of the Community's competence for education. The change in the integration level could not be considered defined in the ruling made in the Brown case where the Court stated clearly that the development level of Community law regarding competence for education during the preliminary ruling does not allow for subsistence and education allowances given to university students of other Member States to be considered to belong within the scope of the Treaties. While in the Gravier and Blaizot case, the Member States submitting their comments lacked the necessary number of votes to have a blocking minority in the Council of the European Union during the preliminary ruling procedure, which would have allowed them to block unfavourable decisions taken via qualified majority voting in the Council of the European Union, the blocking minority was reached in the Brown case. In the Grzelczyk case the Court of Justice dealt with rights stemming from European Union citizenship and solved issues related to the conditions of receiving social benefits. The Court of Justice stated in its ruling that developments have taken place in the EU’s competence for education, making it necessary to change previous case law, i. e. the statements of the Brown case, and to take the position that the EU law recognises certain <b>financial</b> <b>solidarity</b> between Member States and hence also the right of students from other Member States to receive social benefits if certain conditions are met. Despite the existence of a common position of the Member States contradicting the Court of Justice in the Grzelczyk case, the Court made a ruling that could be considered as reinforcing the level of integration. The Member States laid a significantly strong emphasis on the preliminary ruling procedure in the Bidar case, which dealt with issues on receiving study loans, and they took the common position that subsistence allowances do not fall within the scope of the Treaties. Despite the strong opposition by the Member States and the European Commission, the Court found that education allowances in the form of study loans and stipends belong within the scope of the Treaties, and hence extended the rights of students. As the Court of Justice made decisions that clearly increased the rights of students and the Community's competence for education and did this despite the common opposition by the Member States, it can be said that the neofunctionalist integration approach proved to be more accurate. However, the court rulings analysed in this thesis alone are not a sufficient basis to state unambiguously that the Court made rulings reinforcing the integration level regarding the competence for education with the clear aim of increasing its own influence and role, which is why the accuracy of the neofunctionalist integration theory cannot be definitively affirmed. The thesis concludes that the European Union integration process is essentially such a multifaceted and complex process that neither approach alone, i. e. either neofunctionalism or liberal intergovernmentalism, can fully explain the European integration process and the role of intergovernmental institutions in it, which is why further research in this field will be necessary...|$|E
