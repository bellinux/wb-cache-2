The Rejang {{are the largest}} group in Kepahiang and dominate the local cultural life. Because the various groups have coexisted for a long time, cultural influences by others groups (Palembang, Serawai, Javanese, Sundanese, Padangnese, Batak, Acehnese or Chinese) can be identified as well. The <b>heterogenous</b> <b>backgrounds</b> of Kepahiang society caused the development of social aptitudes and manners within society, enabling peaceful coexistence.|$|E
40|$|We {{examined}} the effects of spatial frequency similarity and dissimilarity on human contour integration under various conditions of uncertainty. Participants performed a temporal 2 AFC contour detection task. Spatial frequency jitter up to 3. 0 octaves was applied either to background elements, or to contour and background elements, or to none of both. Results converge on four major findings. (1) Contours defined by spatial frequency similarity alone are only scarcely visible, suggesting the absence of specialized cortical routines for shape detection based on spatial frequency similarity. (2) When orientation collinearity and spatial frequency similarity are combined along a contour, performance amplifies far beyond probability summation when compared to the fully heterogenous condition but only to a margin compatible with probability summation when compared to the fully homogenous case. (3) Psychometric functions are steeper but not shifted for homogenous contours in <b>heterogenous</b> <b>backgrounds</b> indicating an advantageous signal-to-noise ratio. The additional similarity cue therefore not so much improves contour detection performance but primarily reduces observer uncertainty about whether a potential candidate is a contour or just a false positive. (4) Contour integration is a broadband mechanism which is only moderately impaired by spatial frequency dissimilarity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Tracking the 2 D contour of {{a moving}} object has widely {{been used in}} the past years. So called active contour models have been proven to be a {{promising}} approach to real–time tracking of deformable objects. Also tracking 2 D contours, which are projections of rigid 3 D objects, is reduced to tracking deformable 2 D contours. There, the deformations of the contour are caused by the movement in 3 D and the changing perspective to the camera.

40|$|A {{depressive}} {{disorder is}} a disease characterized by a <b>heterogenous</b> <b>background.</b> The important processes observed and diagnosed in depressed patients indicate that the etiology of depression may include disturbances in thyroid hormone (TH) levels and the occurrence of immune‑inflammatory activation. Type 1 (DIO 1) and type 3 (DIO 3) iodothyronine deiodinases are the enzymes which determine the peripheral and tissue levels of TH, but also interfere with immunological cells and inflammatory processes. We aimed to investigate the levels of DIO 1 and DIO 3 in the patients suffering from recurrent depressive disorders (rDD). Data collected from 91 rDD patients and 105 healthy controls were analyzed. The diagnoses were made based on the ICD‑ 10 criteria (F 33. 0 –F 33. 8). The expression levels of DIO 1 and DIO 3 were estimated using the polymerase chain reaction method and the enzyme‑linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The expression of DIO 1 on mRNA/protein levels in the rDD patients was reduced {{in comparison to the}} control subjects, while the expression of DIO 3 was higher in the patients suffering from depression. No significant relationship was found between the investigated DIOs and other clinical parameters. Our results indicate and suggest a role of DIO 1 and DIO 3 ‑related pathways in the pathophysiology of depression. The results represent a promising way to investigate the biological markers of depression...|$|R
40|$|A {{mutation}} called beige, with a phenotype {{similar to}} that of the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome, has occurred independently in two inbred strains of mice. Beige-J (bgj) occurred as a spontaneous mutation in the C 57 B 1 / 6 J strain and beige (bg) was radiation-induced in mice of <b>heterogenous</b> <b>background</b> which were then inbred as strain SB/Le (bg/bg), the subject of the present study. As in the previously characterized C 57 Bl/ 6 J beige-J mutant, there is a correlation between abnormal lysosome structure and defective lysosome function in SB/Le beige mice. They secrete much less than normal amounts of lysosomal enzymes from proximal tubule cells and, hence, have increased lysosomal enzyme activity in kidney. In addition, after treatment of either beige strain with androgen, numerous giant beta-glucuronidase-containing lysosomes are present in kidney proximal tubule cells near the corticomedullary border. By directly measuring the rate of beta-glucuronidase synthesis in androgen-treated SB/Le beige mouse kidney, it was shown that the greater accumulation of this lysosomal enzyme in proximal tubule cells was not due to an increase in its rate of synthesis. Genetic analysis of the beige mutations in the two mutant strains demonstrated that both mutant genes are recessive and, in fact, are allelic. The results suggest that both beige strains are defective in intracellular motility of lysosomes and/or their fusion with cellular membranes, and that both mutant strains are suitable experimental models for the human Chediak-Higashi syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Fimbriae {{have been}} shown to play an {{essential}} role in the adhesion of pathogenic gram-negative bacteria to host cells. In the enteroinvasive bacterium Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, we characterized a previously unknown 11 -kb chromosomal locus involved in the synthesis of type IV pili. The locus consists of 11 open reading frames forming a polycistronic unit and encoding putative Pil proteins, PilLMNOPQRSUVW. When introduced into Escherichia coli, the Y. pseudotuberculosis operon reconstituted bundles of filaments at a pole on the bacterial surface, demonstrating that the pil locus was functional in a <b>heterogenous</b> genetic <b>background.</b> Environmental factors regulated transcription of the Y. pseudotuberculosis operon; in particular, temperature, osmolarity, and oxygen tension were critical cues. Deletion of the type IV pilus gene cluster was associated with a reduction of Y. pseudotuberculosis pathogenicity for mice infected orally. Forty-one percent of Y. pseudotuberculosis strains isolated from human or animal sources harbored the type IV pilus locus. Therefore, the pil locus of Y. pseudotuberculosis might constitute an “adaptation island,” permitting the microorganism to colonize a vast reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Retinitis pigmentosa is a {{hereditary}} {{eye disease}} causing progressive loss of photoreceptor cells, {{which leads to}} an irreversible sight handicap and eventually complete blindness. It is {{a major cause of}} visual handicap or blindness with very <b>heterogenous</b> genetic <b>background.</b> There are four genes accounting for retinitis pigmentosa that encode splicing factors necessary for spliceosomal assembly and function. Unlike any of the other known genes associated with this disease, these are all expressed ubiquitously throughout the human body. Intriguingly, the mutant forms of these vital splicing factors cause cell-type specific disease affecting only photoreceptor cones and rods. Molecular mechanisms underlying this cell-type specific effect remain elusive. One of these splicing factors is the hPrp 31 protein. Its mutant form known as AD 29 is the focal point of this thesis. Some of the effects of this mutation on the cellular level have been discovered recently. A creation of the expression vector followed by expression and purification of the truncated hPrp 31 protein carrying the AD 29 mutation is presented in this thesis. The purified product has been used for production of a αhPrp 31 polyclonal rabbit antibody, whose applicability to western blot and immunofluorescence staining has been verified. Moreover [...] ...|$|R
30|$|The lack of {{significance}} in the published results also {{may be attributed to}} the consistently small sample sizes that have been used to explore the effect of CI vs. IB. The typical study cohort size has varied from 10 to 531 patients but the majority of these trials studied less than 60 patients [52, 75, 77, 78, 80 – 82, 84, 86, 88] (Table 2). The small sample sizes and <b>heterogenous</b> patient <b>background</b> in the clinical studies contribute to insufficient power to investigate the value of both dosing methods. Further to this, if the population of interest is critically ill patients, a single intervention in this setting in very unlikely to influence mortality and clinical cure [31] and, as a consequence, a much larger sample size is needed to show significance [21, 40, 80]. For instance, Roberts et al. calculated that a sample size of 560 patients in each dosing protocol would be needed to detect difference in bacteriological outcomes [75]. Considering the difficulties in achieving these numbers in critically ill patients, perhaps it is time for clinicians to fully acknowledge the importance of surrogate endpoints in the setting of a study. Clinical cure and ICU-free days are suitable surrogate endpoints and may be used as primary outcomes in a phase II study of this intervention.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{contribute}} more knowledge about how arts educational practice in the school context can be understood and developed. The cooperation between Tentahaus Oslo (TO), an initiative driven by artists, and the basic education section for minority students at an upper secondary school is brought forward as an alternative to more traditional forms of encounters with art and art communication in basic education and in the voluntary music and performing arts school. The article points out how the didactic thinking meets structural challenges and opens up spaces where participatory artistic processes and pedagogical processes are integrated. Didactic components like time, space and exchange, an extended time perspective, the placement of an atelier in school, a public exhibition space attached to the atelier, as well as exchange between teachers and the artist, appear as constitutive elements in the systematic cooperation between the fields. In a cross curricular perpsective on learning the article suggests that experiences from the cooperation might have transfer value to a more general school context and to the organization of the music and performing arts school and its teaching practice. The article also directs the attention to didactic arrangements that might increase the amount of students with a <b>heterogenous</b> cultural <b>background</b> in the music and performing arts school. In a larger perspective the importance of encounters with art in an educational context might enhance democratic thinking. The methodological approach is aletic hermeneutics, where empirical material is generated through narrative and critical dialogue...|$|R
