40|$|Innovation <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> {{have been}} used for centuries. In the United States, a recent federal policy change—the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2010 — {{clarified}} and simplified a path by which all federal agencies can offer innovation in-ducement prizes, thus intensifying interest in how government agencies can most effectively design and apply such prizes. This paper aims to review and synthesize the academic literature on innovation <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes,</b> to clarify what has been learned that is relevant to current policy discussions, and to highlight unresolved questions that would be fruitful areas for future academic research and policy experimentation. Relative to the existing literature, this paper aims to bridge two gaps. First, I synthesize the academic literature in this area with an eye toward drawing lessons for the types of innovation <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> under consideration by federal agencies under the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act. Second, I discuss {{the problem of how to}} evaluate the success or failure of innovation <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes,</b> arguing that careful empirical evaluations of innovation <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> are needed in order to provide guidance to federal agencies (and others) on how to most effectively apply and design innovation <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes.</b> C © 2012 by the Association for Public Policy Analysis and Management...|$|R

40|$|Stabilizing {{atmospheric}} {{concentrations of}} greenhouse gases at double their pre-industrial levels (or lower) will require emission reductions far in excess {{of what can be}} achieved with current or projected levels of technology at a politically acceptable cost. Substantial technological innovation is required if {{the nations of the world}} are to come anywhere close to proposed emission reduction targets. Neither traditional federal support for research and development of new technologies nor traditional command-and-control regulations are likely to spur sufficient innovation. Technology <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes,</b> on the other hand, have the potential to incentivize and accelerate the rate of technological innovation in the energy sector. This paper outlines the theory behind the use of <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> to encourage and direct inventive efforts and technological innovation and identifies several comparative advantages <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> have over traditional grants and subsidies for encouraging the invention and development of climate-friendly technologies. While no policy measure guarantees technological innovation, greater reliance on <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> would increase the likelihood of developing and deploying needed technologies in time to alter the world’s climate future.

40|$|Debate {{over the}} merits of patents versus <b>inducement</b> <b>prizes</b> has tended to ignore the {{signaling}} roles of patents, and totally ignores the impact of patent signaling on prize contests. This paper asks: How does patent signaling affect the strategic choices of firms considering entering prize contests? First, we consider contests that do not allow patenting, then contests that do. If patenting is not allowed, we argue, patent-holders, {{both internal and external}} to the contest, can adversely impact prize contests by claiming prize winner violation of their patents, and suing for damages. The likelihood of such challenges being made can deter entry, particularly in contests requiring large sunk costs. Furthermore, the firm's decisionmaking process will discriminate against entering prize contests and favor R&D projects with patentable outcomes. Together, these problems may circumscribe any future wider role for prize contests, and limit their major putative welfare advantage: the ability to place prize winning solutions into the public domain. In contests where entrants may patent their inventions, entry is subject to basically the same problems as above (although such contests may carry some advantages as regards contest design). Our overall conclusion is that prize contests are liable to fail {{due to the lack of}} potential entrants, particularly as regards entry on the part of larger commercial firms...|$|R

40|$|Hackathons are techno-creative events {{during which}} {{participants}} get {{together in a}} physical location. They may be hosted by civic communities, corporations or public institutions. Working individually or in teams, usually for several days, participants develop projects such as hardware or software prototypes. Based on a digital ethnography of two events in the Netherlands and Denmark, this article investigates project development practices at hackathons. In particular, it analyses how participants organized their project work and which technologies were used in support of their creative endeavours. Hackathons are increasingly competitive rather than collaborative events, involving time pressure, <b>inducements</b> such as <b>prizes,</b> and requiring efficient skills utilization. I argue that this facilitates the following tendencies: Firstly, strategic effort is put into final presentations. Projects need to be convincingly presented, and persuasively pitching an idea becomes crucial. Secondly, there is only limited time for personal learning, since participants’ existing skills need to be efficiently applied if a team wants to stay competitive. This encourages division of labour within groups: a tendency which seems especially problematic given that IT skills biases are often {{expressed in terms of}} gender. Thirdly, participants are more inclined to use technologies that are proprietary but appear ‘open enough’. In light of this observation and by drawing on the concept of technology as resource and opportunity, I discuss the techno-political implications of utilized technologies. With this analysis, I aim at contributing to the critical debate on hackathons as productive but likewise ideologically significant fields of ‘hacking cultures’...|$|R

The winning devices must {{also be able to}} continuously record and stream the 5 main vital signs: Blood Pressure, Heart Rate, Oxygen Saturation, Respiratory Rate and Temperature. The name is taken from the Tricorder device from the science fiction TV series Star Trek which can be used to instantly diagnose ailments. The prize was initially announced by the X PRIZE Foundation on 10 May 2011 and subsequently launched on 10 January 2012 at CES 2012. Devices were sent to the University of California San Diego to be independently tested on patients during the winter and spring of 2015, and again in late 2016 at the Altman Clinical and Translational Research Institute (ACTRI) at UCSD. Although no team successfully met all the requirements of the grand prize, the competition was concluded in April 2017 when the XPRIZE Foundation awarded reduced prizes to the strongest performing teams. Most notably, Final Frontier Medical Devices was awarded US$2.6 million and Dynamical Biomarkers won US$1 million. A third team, Cloud DX, was named [...] "Bold Epic Innovator" [...] and awarded US$100,000 for achieving the main milestones of the competition while missing a crucial deadline. Earlier in 2016, some of the funds from the original prize purse were awarded to semi-finalist teams for hitting technology milestones. For the first time at any XPRIZE, the leftover funds from the main prize purse have been earmarked for further development, consumer testing and commercialization of Tricorder prototypes for the two finalists and four semi-finalist teams as part of the Post Prize Initiative.|$|E
40|$|<b>Inducement</b> <b>prize</b> contests, where a {{monetary}} prize is offered for a specified technological achievement, are increasingly popular means of incentivising research and innovation. Such prizes are often modelled by the rent-seeking Tullock contest, or an all-pay auction. However, the direct application of such models can overlook some particular features of technological competition. This thesis addresses three such features. The first model notes that preliminary prizes are often part of contest designs. A two-round Tullock model {{is used to}} investigate a potential motivation for offering such prizes when contestants have different productivities. A designer can identify and purchase {{the rights to the}} more productive technology where the award of the preliminary prize is conditional on the winner licensing his technology to other contestants. In this way, endowing a preliminary round results in the potential for increased second round productivity, but at the cost of a reduced second round prize. Such a structure is optimal when the productivities are sufficiently different. In the second model, it is noted that expenditures in <b>inducement</b> <b>prize</b> contests are often too large to be explained by the cash prize alone. There usually exists a final consumer application of the research. This chapter examines how different types of prizes arise by considering the informational content of winning and the effect this has on quality differentiation in when there is an established quality leader. A purely informational 2 prize influences investment decisions and also the qualities offered in the market. The main result is that some prizes may aim to select the highest quality firm as often as possible, whereas other prizes may aim to reward the entrant only if a significant improvement in quality is made. In the third model, prizes are not the only instruments available to contest designers. In particular, subsidy of spending may be possible. This chapter uses an intuitive interpretation of the Tullock contest to offer a matching-funds instrument to a budget constrained principal. It is shown that symmetric prize/subsidy contest designs may be optimal even in the context of contestant asymmetry, in contrast to most existing contest design models. It is also shown that if only one subsidy is offered, it is always to the weaker contestant. The role of contest accuracy in these findings is also considered This thesis is not currently available via ORA...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{contributions}} in the environmental literature {{seem to suggest that}} incentives to environmental research is lower than incentives to ordinary research, arguing in favor for additional support for environmental R&D. Their arguments are based on the conjecture of the commitment problem. Since the government influences incentives implicitly through their environmental policy, they may be tempted to expropriate rents from the successful innovation with strategic taxation. In this thesis I analyze whether the incentives to environmental R&D is systematically lower, due to both the appropriability problem and the commitment problem. Secondly I investigate how an <b>inducement</b> <b>prize</b> to environmental innovations can remedy these market failures. My conclusion on the standard commitment problem confirm the results in Greaker and Hoel (2011) where a ranking of incentives is arbitrary, depending on parameter values. This gives no reason to frequently use of innovation prizes to environmental R&D. I therefore expand the analysis and introduce a political disturbance, investigating whether this gives a specific ranking. It turns out that intermediate disturbance gives a distinct underprovision of environmental R&D. For this special case innovation prizes will restore the optimal level of incentives. The thesis contains of a historical introduction and a discussion of innovation prizes as an inducement mechanism for environmental R&D...|$|E
