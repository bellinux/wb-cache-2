50|$|The disability-adjusted life {{year is a}} {{societal}} measure of the disease or disability burden in populations. DALYs are calculated by combining measures of life expectancy {{as well as the}} adjusted quality of life during a burdensome disease or disability for a population. DALYs are related to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) measure; however QALYs only measure the benefit with and without medical intervention and therefore do not measure the total burden. Also, QALYs tend to be an <b>individual</b> <b>measure,</b> and not {{a societal}} measure.|$|E

5000|$|The {{internal}} measurement {{is one of}} {{the measurement}} theories. From, we introduce the definition of the internal measurement. The experience consists of [...] "unremitting measurements". These [...] "unremitting measurements" [...] appear only in the experience. In the experience, if any individual has a relation to another individual then this is a [...] "measurement which identifies another individual", where this measurement enable if the individual can specify the effects from another individual. Moreover, a [...] "measurement which identifies another individual" [...] is unremitting in the experience. As above a measurement such that if any <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> another individual then this measurement inherent in [...] "unremitting measurements" [...] is called the internal measurement. This theory is found by Kouichirou Matsuno and is developed by Yukio-Pegio Gunji.|$|E

30|$|The {{use of an}} <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of {{technical}} change is crucial. First, {{we believe that the}} obsolescence of individual skills starts from the very entry of individuals into the labor market. Enduring into a certain industry is the product of pre-entry individual skills like the education level and on-the-job training and learning (which we do not observe). 11 Second, early retirement occurs because the working-life horizon elderly individuals face is short enough to make on-the-job training too costly to bear compared to the potential benefits of remaining in the labor market, net of all demographic, health, and socio-economic characteristics. However, the focus on the last years before retirement {{does not take into account}} the progressive depreciation of individual skills and the role that individual work trajectories play in the decision to retire early. In other words, our measure of working-life technical change allows us to reduce the individual unobserved heterogeneity that is not captured by, e.g., individual fixed effects. Third, an <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> generates the necessary heterogeneity in technical change across individuals that belong to the same sector that allows us to distinguish sectoral and time effects from the actual technical change faced by individuals.|$|E
40|$|Energy {{consumption}} (heat and coolness) {{of buildings}} depends on numerous factors. In the diploma thesis, I {{have focused on}} the influence of construction elements. I have analysed the measures for improvement of energy efficiency of a building, on the level of development of transparent and nontransparent building envelope. Relative efficiency of an <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> was tested in relation to the climate parameters of the selected locations in Slovenia. Using a computer programme for calculation of energy balance TOST, I have analysed the influence of five selected measures for improvement of energy efficiency of a building. The efficiency of an <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> and the combined efficiency of all measures are discussed, with regards to the calculated amount of heat required for heating of the building, and coolness required for cooling. For the research of location influence on energy consumption, I have selected ten locations in Slovenia that differ the most in terms of solar radiation (kWh/m 2) and the average air temperature (°C). I have successfully proven that the location of a building and its climate characteristics are important factors in planing of building construction and renovation...|$|E
30|$|Many {{adaptive}} {{hypothesis testing}} procedures rely on {{estimates of the}} proportion of true null hypotheses in the initial pool using plugins, a single step, in multiple steps, or asymptotically [4]. Plug-in procedures use {{an estimate of the}} proportion of true null hypotheses [15]. Thresholding-based multiple testing procedures, reject hypotheses with p-values less than a threshold [15]. Storey and Tibshirani [22] have proposed a strategy that assigns each hypothesis an <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of significance in terms of expected FDR called q-value. Most q-value based strategies rely on some estimate of the proportion of true null hypotheses.|$|E

30|$|Our {{goal here}} is to explore in a {{quantitative}} manner the relationship between performance, an <b>individual</b> <b>measure,</b> and success, a collective measure capturing the societal acknowledgement of a given level of performance. Previous research, some using Google search results {{as a proxy for}} fame, have suggested that performance can indeed drive success [24 – 31]. Here, by exploring the time-lines of both achievement and its recognition, we uncover how performance affects success over the career of an individual. We do so through sports, an area where performance is accurately recorded in terms of number of wins, place in rankings or career records [32 – 38].|$|E

There are important caveats to our analysis: (a) our estimates of the relationship between within - school segregation and outcomes are not causal; and (b) friendships may not be the only relevant cross-race social interaction that occurs within a school...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explored}} the concurrent {{validity of the}} Quick Test (QT) as a brief <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of intelligence by correlating it with the Wechsler Preschool and Primary Scale of Intelligence (WPPSI). The subjects were 72 urban preschool children (15 black, 57 white) from Muncie, Indiana. The subjects {{ranged in age from}} 4 ½ to 6 ½ years, and were chosen from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds. Subjects were randomly assigned to two groups, each comprised of 36 females and 36 males. Tests were administered by two graduate students in clinical psychology and rotated to control for the effects of testing order. The correlation coefficients between the QT and WPPSI Full, Verbal and Performance Scale IQs were r =. 64, r =. 67 and r =. 52, respectively. All correlations were significant at the. 001 level. The strong correlation (r =. 67) between the WPPSI Verbal and QT IQ suggests that the QT may be a good brief measure of verbal intelligence. The mean IQs for the WPPSI Full (102), Verbal (99), and Performance (106) were all significantly different (p <. 001) from the QT mean IQ of 92. This seems to suggest that the WPPSI and QT mean IQs should not be used interchangeably. Standard deviations for the WPPSI Verbal, Performance, Full Scale, and QT IQs were 14. 63, 16. 85, 15. 92, and 20. 51, respectively. The present concurrent validity is strong enough to support the use of the QT as a brief <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of verbal intelligence. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|E
30|$|It {{is clear}} from the wording of the NLES {{question}} that the instrument does not measure problem gambling prevalence or prevalence for any of the items. It asks respondents if gambling has …been a problem for you, your family or close friends during the last year. Therefore, the NLES gambling problem item measures the reach or extent of gambling problems throughout peoples’ social and family networks and is not an <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> of problem gambling. This broader conceptualisation of gambling-related harm is consistent with the Australian definition of problem gambling which states that “problem gambling is characterised by difficulties in limiting money and/or time spent on gambling which leads to adverse consequences for the gambler, others, or for the communities” (Neal et al. 2005, p 126).|$|E

The key determinants of the contract form for any <b>individual</b> <b>measure</b> are the expected joint surplus from an agreement and the expected loss to the constrained government. The loss is higher for domestic subsidies and nonviolations because these are the policies most likely to correct domestic distortions.
