40|$|Many lakes have positive, <b>heterograde</b> {{vertical}} oxygen (O 2) profiles with a metalimnetic maximum usually {{assumed to}} be the result of biological O 2 production. However, supersaturated metalimnetic O 2 maxima are formed by biological processes (net photosynthetic production of O 2) and physical processes (warming of gas-ses trapped below the thermocline). Although the mechanisms contributing to supersaturated metalimnetic O 2 peaks are understood, the contribution of biological vs. physical processes is not well known in lakes. To examine these contributions, we measured O 2 and argon (Ar) saturation anomalies in the metalimnia of 17 lakes. Unlike O 2, Ar is biologically inert and, therefore, can be used to quantify physical processes. There was a positive Ar anomaly at the depth of the O 2 maximum in every lake. On average, only 14 % of the O 2 maxi-mum could be attributed solely to biological production of O 2, but this percentage varied widely among lakes. Additionally, in a subset of lakes, the relative saturation of O 2 at the metalimnetic maximum was lower than Ar due to net biological consumption, creating a weaker O 2 maximum than would be expected based on the physical processes alone. Some lakes were sampled multiple times during summer and net ecosystem production (NEP) was also calculated. There were many instances of positive NEP in the metalimnion; how-ever, net autotrophy was usually transient instead of persistent. Overall, biological production of O 2 alone i...|$|E

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Water column characteristics of three coastal cave systems in Quintana Roo, Mexico on the Yucatan Peninsula were profiled from January 1996 to July 1997. A Hydrolab Data Sonde 3 Multiprobe Logger was used to acquire in situ water column data on temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, and pH of the caves. Water columns were divided into three zones, brackish, transition, and saline, and a new method was employed to define these boundaries by using "best it" calculations and subsequent regression coefficients for comparisons. Profiled Hydrolab data displayed the striking and perennially stratified nature of these cave systems while statistical analyses revealed their highly dynamic character. Temperature profiles remained stable and persistent throughout the study. In these systems the presence of a thermal discontinuity or thermocline, is the norm. Salinity profiles exhibited sharp density gradients, or haloclines, one to three meters in thickness. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were consistently low and revealed negative <b>heterograde</b> oxygen curves, otherwise known as oxygen minima, residing at the transition zone. Hydrogen ion concentrations (pH) varied and also displayed a marked decrease at the transition zone. Transition zone thickness changed considerably over time and from system to system. Statistical analysis indicated a significant difference in temperature, salinity, DO, pH, and transition zone depth from profile to profile and between dry and rainy seasons...|$|E
40|$|Lake Mead is a deep, subtropical, {{moderately}} productive, desert impoundment with {{a negative}} <b>heterograde</b> oxygen profile occurring during; the summer stratification. investigations of the Boulder Basin of Lake Mead by the University of Nevada were initiated in November 1971. The primary objective {{of the study was}} to determine what effects industrial and sewage effluent from the Las Vegas metropolitan area, discharged into Las Vegas Bay, have had on the water quality and limnological conditions of Boulder Basin. Data from the 1975 - 76 period are presented in detail, with earlier data included in the summaries and discussions. Measurements of water temperature, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH. Alkalinity, nutrient concentrations, phytoplankton numbers, chlorophyll a, primary productivity, zooplankton concentrations, and coliform bacteria were made monthly or biweekly. Success patterns for both phytoplankton and zooplankton are described. Physical factors affecting the distribution arid deposition of enteric bacteria (including those of special public health importance) in Las Vegas Bay are discussed. The distribution of water arid of enteric bacteria of possible fecal origin into Las Vegas Bay from Las Vegas Wash were determined. The unreliability of thoroughly referenced techniques and methods, generally accepted as standard for enteric bacteria, are treated in detail. Water from Las Vegas Wash forms a density current in Las Vegas Bay. The density current is located on the bottom during isothermal conditions and in the metalimnion during summer stratification. The metalimnetic oxygen minimum was examined in some detail and found to be caused by biological respiration. Estimations of zooplankton and phytoplankton respiration indicate that they could account for the majority of the oxygen lost in the metalimnion. Primary production and algal biomass were higher in Las Vegas Bay because of nutrient enrichment from Las Vegas Wash. The inner portion of Las Vegas Bay would be classified as eutrophic and the outer portion of Las Vegas Bay and Boulder Basin as mesotrophic. Nitrogen is likely to be the most limiting nutrient...|$|E
40|$|The Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, Division of Fisheries, {{has been}} {{considering}} Holland Lake for stocking with brown trout. Holland Lake, a Twin Cities Metro Area lake, with a {{surface area of}} 0. 14 km 2 and a maximum depth of about 61 ft (18, 8 m) is located in Dakota County, The lake has two shallow subbasins with {{a substantial amount of}} rooted vegetation and a deep subbasin, which is thermally suitable for brown trout, However, due to a high oxygen depletion rate in summer, the lake becomes anoxic below the surface mixed layer, A combination of high water temperatures in the surface mixed layer and low dissolved oxygen below the surface mixed layer makes it difficult for brown trout to survive in summer, For possible future aeration of the lake, the dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics of the lake were studied. Historical records show that DO depletes at a rate of 0. 47 mg. l"]. day-] after spring oveliu 11 l in the upper stratum of the metalimnion (from 10 to 20 ft depth), such that the lake develops a negative <b>heterograde</b> DO profile by early July. DO depletes at a lower rate (0. 22 mg. 1 "]. day-I) in the lower stratum of the metalinmion (from 20 to 30 ft depth). By mid-August, the entire metalimnion becomes completely anoxic, To better understand and to quantify the processes that contribute to the DO dynamics in the lake, temperature, DO, Secchi depth, photosynthetically active radiation (P AR), total suspended solids (TSS), total organic carbon (TOC), total respiration rate and chl-a concentrations were monitored or measured at three locations during the SUlIDner of 1999. The Secchi depth varied from 5 to 10 ft (1. 5 to 3. 0 m) in the deep subbasin and from 2. 5 to 9 ft (0. 75 to 2. 7 m) in the easte 11 l shallow subbasin. The PAR measurements showed ail attenuation coefficient of about 0. 25 ft-I in the deep subbasin; it varied with depth by two orders of magnitude (from 0. 2 ft-) to 25 fr]) in the shallow subbasins, indicating increasing macrophyte density with depth. In the deep subbasin, the TSS concentration varied from 1 to 3 mgll with a maximum of 5 mgll in the upper stratum of the metalimnion. About 76 % of the TSS were volatile, which indicates that most if not all TSS is organic material. Carbonaceous biological oxygen demand (CBOD) was estimated using the TOC profiles. The average CBOD was 18. 7 mg/l, with a maximum of 24 mgll in the upper stratum of the metalimnion. Metro Region Fisheries, Minnesota Department of Natural Resource...|$|E
