5|$|C-SPAN {{offers a}} number of public {{services}} related to the network's public affairs programming. C-SPAN Classroom, a free membership service for teachers, began in July 1987 and offers help using C-SPAN resources for classes or research. The C-SPAN School Bus, introduced in November 1993, traveled around the U.S. educating the public about government and politics using C-SPAN resources, {{and served as a}} mobile television studio. The bus also recorded video footage of the places that it visited. A second bus was introduced in 1996. The two original buses were retired in 2010, and the C-SPAN <b>Digital</b> <b>Bus</b> was inaugurated, introducing the public to C-SPAN's enhanced digital products. C-SPAN has also equipped six Local Content Vehicles (LCVs) to travel the country and record unique political and historical stories, with each vehicle containing production and web-based technologies to produce on-the-spot content.|$|E

5000|$|DCB (<b>Digital</b> Control <b>Bus,</b> <b>Digital</b> Connection <b>Bus</b> or <b>Digital</b> Communication <b>Bus</b> in some sources) was a {{proprietary}} data interchange interface by Roland Corporation, developed in 1981 and introduced in 1982 in their Roland Juno-60 and Roland Jupiter-8 products. [...] DCB functions were {{basically the same}} as MIDI, but unlike MIDI (which is capable of transmitting {{a wide array of}} information), DCB could provide note on/off, program change and vcf/vca control only. DCB-to-MIDI adapters were produced for a number of early Roland products. The DCB interface was made in 2 variants, the earlier one used 20-pin sockets and cables, later switching to the 14-pin Amphenol DDK connector vaguely resembling a parallel port.|$|R
