50|$|The {{monument}} {{was eventually}} commissioned in 1931 from sculptor Bohumil Kafka, {{a professor at}} Prague's Academy of Visual Arts, outside the tender. The sculpture {{was intended to be}} monumental and realistic. It took Kafka ten years to complete the sculpture, and an advisory board of nine people was established to supervise his work, consisting of specialists, historians and hippologists. For this job, Bohumil Kafka had a new studio built in Ořechovka, Prague, 27m high and 18m wide. Firstly he began work on model of a horse without the rider. Several men then modelled for the rider part, conceiving the rider's position, body and head. Experts in historical armament provided information not only on the rider's clothing style, but also many other details, such as the design of the <b>foot</b> <b>frame.</b> Kafka made a plaster model of Žižka's statue in November 1941 and died shortly afterwards.|$|E
40|$|Background: Orthopaedic {{surgeons}} {{are being}} increasingly confronted with complex ankle problems that cannot be reliably treated by conventional arthrodesis procedures. The Ilizarov technique {{can be an}} alternative salvage method in such cases. Methods: Twenty-two Ilizarov tibiotalar arthrodeses were retro-spectively reviewed. There were 16 men and six women (mean age 49 years). The underlying pathology was infection after internal fixation of ankle or plafond fractures in 16 patients, posttraumatic ankle arthritis in five, and septic arthritis after an infected Achilles tendon repair in one. Five patients {{had at least one}} failed previous arthrodesis. Primary iliac crest bone grafting was done in two patients. Proximal tibial lengthening was done in six patients. Results: Twenty-one patients were followed for an average of 29 months. A solid fusion was achieved in all patients by the end of treatment. The external fixation time averaged 27. 7 (range 12 to 84) weeks. The mean time spent in a <b>foot</b> <b>frame</b> was 22. 3 weeks. Complications occurred in 11 patients, including two nonunions that healed after revision and renewed frame application and four pin track infections. Conclusions: The use of the Ilizarov frame provides a successful salvage method that offers solid bony fusion, optimal leg length, and eradication of infection in complex ankle pathology or failed previous arthrodesis...|$|E
30|$|The usual {{corticotomy}} {{site for}} leg lengthening {{is at the}} junction of the proximal and the middle thirds of the tibia. Eralp et al. [21] reported that the Gigli saw technique for tibial lengthening gave a lower healing index (HI) in 16 patients with post-poliomyelitic deformities compared with percutaneous multiple drill hole osteotomy. Kristiansen and Steen [22] suggested a bifocal osteotomy for tibial lengthening of more than 6  cm {{in order to reduce}} HI and the period of external fixation. The technique of percutaneous osteotomy with an osteotome, as performed in this series, preserves the periosteum and permits an earlier start to distraction (5  days after surgery) at the rate of 1  mm per day in the beginning and 0.75  mm daily subsequently. In this report, we found the healing index was 1.7 for those cases that underwent leg lengthening, a result comparable with other authors’ studies. Ankle equinus occurs frequently during or after the tibial lengthening, and the incidence will depend on the distraction rate, the amount of lengthening, the patient’s age, the aetiology of tibial shortening and the technique of wire or pin insertion. Previous investigators have reported the incidence of ankle equinus after tibial lengthening to vary from 10 % to 50 % and dependent on the aetiology of shortening [20, 23, 24]. Eldridge et al. [25] and Lehman et al. [26] recommend prophylactic foot fixation during the lengthening phase with a <b>foot</b> <b>frame</b> in order to avoid ankle equinus and its removal during the consolidation phase for patients with tibial lengthening beyond 10 % of the original length or more than 6  cm. Huang [19] reports 11 cases of ankle equinus and 2 cases of knee flexion contracture in 35 lengthenings of poliomyelitic tibiae. He recommends prophylactic tendon Achilles lengthening (TAL) as a concomitant procedure during tibial lengthening. In all cases in this series, we fixed the foot in the fixator, which then enabled for the correction of the deformity by the closed method. Song [27] had 4 procurvatum deformities at the proximal tibia in 14 cases during lengthening. We choose to apply the proximal tibial ring obliquely in order to prevent this complication during lengthening of the tibia as we are able to correct procurvatum at the end of distraction.|$|E

50|$|Sennett Federated Church and Parsonage is a {{historic}} church formed in 1929 from the combining of Baptist and Congregational churches located in the hamlet of Sennett, {{in the town of}} Sennett in Cayuga County, New York. Both congregations were committed to the abolition movement and to the Underground Railroad. The church was constructed in 1848 for the Congregational church and probably incorporates part of an earlier 1820 church building. The parsonage was built in 1818 and was constructed as a 16 feet by 24 <b>feet</b> <b>frame</b> building. It was enlarged in the mid 19th century into a typical Greek Revival style gable and wing building, perhaps incorporating the earlier structure as the west wing.|$|R

40|$|A whole-body {{torque control}} {{framework}} adapted for balancing and walking tasks {{is presented in}} this paper. In the proposed approach, centroidal momentum terms are excluded {{in favor of a}} hierarchy of high-priority position and orientation tasks and a low-priority postural task. More specifically, the controller stabilizes the position of the center of mass, the orientation of the pelvis frame, as well as the position and orientation of the <b>feet</b> <b>frames.</b> The low-priority postural task provides reference positions for each joint of the robot. Joint torques and contact forces to stabilize tasks are obtained through quadratic programming optimization. Besides the exclusion of centroidal momentum terms, part of the novelty of the approach lies in the definition of control laws in SE(3) which do not require the use of Euler parameterization. Validation of the framework was achieved in a scenario where the robot kept balance while walking in place. Experiments have been conducted with the iCub robot, in simulation and in real-world experiments. Comment: manuscript submitted to Humanoids 201...|$|R

5000|$|The 3B (3B20D/3B20C/3B21D/3B21E) is a 32-bit microprogrammed duplex (redundant) high {{availability}} processor unit with a real-time operating system. It {{is used in}} the telecommunications environment and was first produced in the late 1970s at the WECo factory in Lisle, Illinois. It uses the Duplex Multi Environment Real Time (DMERT) operating system which was renamed UNIX-RTR (Real Time Reliable) in 1982. The Data Manipulation Unit (DMU) provided arithmetic and logic operations on 32 bit words using AMD 2901 bipolar 4-bit processor elements. The first 3B20D was called the Model 1. Each processor's control unit consisted of two frames of circuit packs. The whole duplex system required many seven <b>foot</b> <b>frames</b> of circuit packs plus at least one tape drive frame (most telephone companies wrote billing data on magnetic tapes), and many washing machine sized (and look with the open top door) disk drives.
