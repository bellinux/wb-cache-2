This violates the convention in New South Wales, where numbered routes below 50 are prefixed with an 'A' and 'B' routes are numbered above 50; the violation was allowed so the number and letter would be consistent across state lines.|$|E
5|$|Congress is not {{prevented}} from legislating as to tribes generally; and {{this appears to}} be what it has done in successive versions of the Nonintercourse Act. There is nothing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Act</b> to suggest that ‘tribe’ is to be read to exclude a bona fide tribe not otherwise federally recognized. Nor, as the district court found, is there evidence of congressional intent or legislative history squaring with appellants' interpretation. Rather we find an inclusive reading consonant with the policy and purpose of the Act.|$|E
5|$|Development in Canberra {{has been}} closely {{regulated}} by government, both through planning processes {{and the use}} of crown lease terms that have tightly limited the use of parcels of land.

5000|$|In one of MacDonald's first books, Christianizing Homer: The Odyssey, Plato, and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew, he posited {{the theory}} that <b>the</b> non-canonical <b>Acts</b> of Andrew was a Christian retelling of Homer's Iliad. [...] In it he argued that one could detect trends that showed {{parallels}} between the Homeric epic and <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew. He argued that <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew is better understood <b>in</b> light of <b>the</b> Odyssey. That the order of events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> follows those found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of Andrew, that certain events <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> are better understood when understood <b>in</b> context of <b>the</b> Homeric epics, and that the Homeric texts commonly were available during the first century AD. In subsequent works, MacDonald expanded his hypothesis to include <b>the</b> <b>Acts</b> of <b>the</b> Apostles and the Gospel of Mark as being Christian variations of the Homeric epics.|$|R

This pawn handicap created further interest in the Turk, and spawned a book by W. J. Hunneman chronicling the matches played with this handicap. Despite the handicap, the Turk (operated by Mouret at the time) ended up with forty-five victories, three losses, and two stalemates.|$|E
