5|$|Households {{with incomes}} between 100% and 400% {{of the federal}} poverty level were {{eligible}} to receive <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> for policies purchased via an exchange. Subsidies are provided as an advanceable, refundable tax credits. Additionally, small businesses are eligible for a tax credit provided that they enroll in the SHOP Marketplace. Under the law, workers whose employers offer affordable coverage will not be eligible for subsidies via the exchanges. To be eligible the cost of employer-based health insurance must exceed 9.5% of the worker's household income.|$|E
5|$|Trump's October 12, 2017 {{executive}} order and a related action {{the same day}} ending <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> of questionable legality used to help those buying insurance through exchanges with their co-payments and deductibles. About 6 million people were helped {{at a cost of}} $7 billion a year but that amount was expected to double in 10 years. State officials claimed the action caused insurance premiums to go up dramatically. Many states sued in federal court on the grounds that Trump was not legally allowed to take the action.|$|E
5|$|Community Transit is {{administered}} by a nine-member board, composed of {{two members of the}} Snohomish County Council, two elected officials from PTBA cities with populations of 30,000 or more, three elected officials from cities with between 10,000 and 30,000, and two elected officials from cities with less than 10,000, that meets monthly at their headquarters in Everett. The board is led by a non-voting chief executive officer, a position held by Emmett Heath since he was promoted from interim CEO in March 2015. CT adopted an operating budget of $133.2 million for 2015; 65 to 70 percent of revenue is provided by a 0.9 percent sales tax within the PTBA, the maximum authorized for transit agencies under state law, while a combination of fares and <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> comprise the remainder. The agency employs 579 full-time equivalent persons, divided into eight departments.|$|E

5000|$|Corn is the {{top crop}} for subsidy payments. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 {{mandates}} that billions of gallons of ethanol be blended into vehicle fuel each year, guaranteeing demand, but US corn ethanol subsidies are between $5.5 billion and $7.3 billion per year. Producers also benefitted from a <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy</b> of 51 cents per gallon, additional state <b>subsidies,</b> and <b>federal</b> crop <b>subsidies</b> that can bring the total to 85 cents per gallon or more. However, the <b>federal</b> ethanol <b>subsidy</b> expired December 31, 2011. (US corn-ethanol producers were shielded from competition from cheaper Brazilian sugarcane-ethanol by a 54-cent-per-gallon tariff; however, that tariff also expired December 31, 2011.) ...|$|R
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues fueled the rise of <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|Harrison lost {{a bid for}} Senate in 1831, {{and found}} {{insufficient}} support to mount {{a run for the}} House of Representatives in 1832. His large family gave him money problems, and he remained out of public life in the early 1830s. By 1834, opposition to President Jackson was coalescing into {{what became known as the}} Whig Party. Harrison, though several years out of active politics was a war hero with roots in both North and South, and had been fired by Jackson. Thus, he looked attractive as a possible presidential candidate to the new party, something that Harrison did nothing to discourage. Harrison wrote a letter to the newspapers that won over many Whigs, assuring them of his fidelity to party principles, such as the limited power of the executive and <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> for roads, canals and railroads.|$|E
5|$|States that {{rejected}} the Medicaid expansion could maintain their Medicaid eligibility thresholds, which {{in many states}} were significantly below 133% of the poverty line. Many states did not make Medicaid available to childless adults at any income level. Because subsidies on exchange insurance plans were not available to those below the poverty line, such individuals had no new options. For example, in Kansas, where only able-bodied adults with children and with an income below 32% of the poverty line were eligible for Medicaid, those with incomes from 32% to 100% of the poverty level ($6,250 to $19,530 {{for a family of}} three) were ineligible for both Medicaid and <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> to buy insurance. Absent children, able-bodied adults were not eligible for Medicaid in Kansas.|$|E
50|$|The 1916 {{law also}} {{replaced}} the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy</b> {{with an annual}} budget to cover most Guard expenses, including drill pay, and the Division of Militia Affairs was expanded to form the Militia Bureau (now National Guard Bureau).|$|R

5|$|The Omaha Traction Company, which {{operated}} as the Street Railway Company, {{changed its}} name to the Omaha Transit Company when streetcar service ended in the city in 1952. After World War II Omahans preferred their automobiles and new highways. When the Urban Mass Transit Act of 1964 was passed, Omaha's private transit companies were not able to apply for <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> available to public transit operators. The Omaha Transit Company ceased operations on June 30, 1972, when the City of Omaha assumed authority for public transportation in the city. City Transit Lines, another private company in Omaha, went out of business on that day as well. The Metro Area Transit Authority was created by the Nebraska Legislature, consisting of a five-member board appointed by the mayor and confirmed by Omaha's City Council and the Douglas County Commissioners. It acquired the assets of the Omaha Transit Company and selected assets of the City Transit Lines of Council Bluffs, along with more than $3,000,000 in federal funding. The Authority operates today as Metro Area Transit, or MAT.|$|E
25|$|Price {{supported}} the proposed Protect Life Act of 2011, {{which would have}} amended the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (often abbreviated as the ACA) to deny <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> to any health insurance plans offering abortion coverage - exceptions would have been allowed {{in the cases of}} rape, incest, or when a mother's life is at risk. The ACA already banned <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> from being used to cover abortions, but did allow health insurance plans covering abortions to receive <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies,</b> so long as such funding was not directly used for abortion coverage. The Protect Life Act would have also allowed hospitals to refuse life-saving abortions to women in emergency situations.|$|E

30|$|The {{costs of}} German {{unification}} and poor employment performance were the backdrop to the Kohl government’s other important pension reform, the Pension Reform Act 1999 (adopted in 1997). The reform included modest cuts in disability pensions, a demographic factor linking benefits {{to changes in}} life expectancy, another increase in the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy,</b> and improvement {{in the value of}} pension credits for child-rearing. Unlike the 1989 pension compromise, however, the CDU/CSU-FDP government now faced a Bundesrat dominated by the SPD. To head off a Bundesrat veto, the government divided the legislation into two parts, one that did not need the consent of the Bundesrat, and one that did. The non-financial provisions of the reform were thus included in the Pension Reform Act 1999, which the Bundestag adopted in October 1997. The Bundesrat used its right to object to the legislation, but the Bundestag was able to overrule this by a simple majority. The financial heart of the reform, the increase in the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy,</b> was then introduced as separate legislation requiring the approval of both chambers. After a complicated negotiation process in which the SPD in the Bundesrat agreed to support the legislation if it included an increase in the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy</b> (financed by an increase in VAT) and improved pension coverage for the marginally employed (which ultimately failed), both chambers adopted the legislation. (see Schulze and Jochem 2007 and Schludi 2005 for detailed analyses).|$|R
30|$|The social insurance-based {{structure}} of the statutory pension has {{been the target of}} reform since the 1960 s. If social insurance contributions finance defined benefits, the locus of adjustment is always on the contribution side, rather than the benefit side. Starting in the late 1960 s, policy-makers began raising contributions to finance anticipated increases in the number of pensioners relative to workers (Hockerts 2011). The unemployment crises of the 1970 s, 1980 s, and 1990 s led to more contribution hikes (Fig.  4), as did German unification, because the social insurance system was used to absorb much of the cost of unification (Manow and Seils 2000). Rising unemployment meant that the revenue base (pension-qualifying payroll) did not increase in line with pension costs, and this pushed up non-wage labor costs as well as state expenditures (Fig.  4). Policy-makers have responded to growing pension costs by increasing the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy</b> (Bundeszuschuss) to the statutory pension system. As Fig.  5, shows, the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy</b> remained fairly stable between 1979 and the mid- 1990 s, financing 18 – 22 [*]% of expenditure. Starting in 1998, however, reforms have expanded the overall size of the <b>federal</b> <b>subsidy</b> through the creation of special subsidies financed by ear-marked revenue sources, such as a proportion of VAT and a new eco-tax (Ökosteuer) revenues. Thus, even if political actors agreed on the basic features of the system, high contribution rates and growing state pension costs created strong incentives for cost-cutting and measures to strengthen financing.|$|R

25|$|On August 30, 2007, {{a report}} by the United States Census Bureau {{indicated}} that Mississippi was the poorest state in the country. Major cotton farmers in the Delta have large, mechanized plantations, and they receive the majority of extensive <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> going to the state, yet many other residents still live as poor, rural, landless laborers. The state's sizable poultry industry has faced similar challenges in its transition from family-run farms to large mechanized operations. Of $1.2 billion from 2002–2005 in <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> to farmers in the Bolivar County area of the Delta, only 5% went to small farmers. There has been little money apportioned for rural development. Small towns are struggling. More than 100,000 people have left the region in search of work elsewhere. The state had a median household income of $34,473.|$|E
25|$|Post-World War II suburbanization, {{encouraged}} by <b>federal</b> <b>subsidies</b> for highways, drew more established white residents {{out of the}} city. In {{the latter part of}} the 20th century, restructuring of industry and railroads resulted in a massive loss of industrial jobs in Baltimore. These changes produced problems of depopulation, unemployment and poverty.|$|E

50|$|As Premier, Davis {{continued}} his policy of debt reduction (for which he attained an increased <b>Federal</b> <b>subsidy),</b> and convinced the unelected Legislative Council to vote {{itself out of}} existence in January 1876.
