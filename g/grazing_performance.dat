Treatments consisted of either no supplemental energy or access to feeders containing a free choice, grain-based energy supplement. On the first day of the grazing period, steers were weighed and randomly allotted among eight pastures, providing four replications per treatment. Stocking density was 34 % higher for supplemented than for unsupplemented pastures. At the end of the grazing period, steers were transported to a commercial feedlot and allowed ad libitum access to a common finishing diet for an average of 171 days. Supplement intake averaged 5. 4 ± 1. 1 lb/day (dry matter basis) or approximately 0. 90 % of body weight during the grazing period. Supplementation increased (P< 0. 01) grazing period gains from 1. 47 to 2. 20 lb/day. Supplementation also increased (P< 0. 01) ribeye area, back fat, and rump fat at the end of the grazing period. Supplementation did not affect subsequent finishing performance or carcass merit, but it reduced (P< 0. 01) time required for finishing by 18 days.

A total of 2, 764 steers of Mexican origin averaging 449 lb were assembled in Texas and shipped to Kansas, where they grazed on three intensively-early-stocked Flint Hills pastures. At initial processing, the steers were individually weighed and randomly assigned to either a non-implanted control group or a Ralgro implant group. Ralgro steers gained more (23 lb; P< 0. 01) than controls during the 82 - to 93 -day grazing phase. Following the grazing phase, all steers were shipped to a commercial feedlot in southwestern Kansas where steers from each pasture were individually weighed and given a single Component E-S® implant. Immediately after processing, steers from each pasture were sorted into either a light- or heavy-weight pen, regardless of pasture implant treatment, resulting in six feedlot pens. Days on feed ranged from 127 to 197. Control steers gained faster (P< 0. 01) during the feedlot phase; however, Ralgro steers had higher cumulative weight gains across the combined pasture and feedlot phases (P< 0. 01) and averaged three fewer days on feed (P< 0. 05). There were no significant differences for marbling, fat thickness, ribeye area, KPH fat, or yield grade.

40|$|In {{temperate}} and oceanic regions, grazed {{grass is}} the lowest cost feed available for milk production. In other regions, grazed grass is less important but {{can contribute to the}} diet of livestock. Within high output systems the interaction between the animal and sward is challenging for a host of reasons, including intake and milk production potential, substitution, grass allowance, quality, etc., which often means that grass utilisation and quality are compromised. Adaptation of grazing management and implementation of a range of grazing strategies can provide possibilities to increase the proportion of grazed grass in the diet of dairy cows in high output systems. As Europe transitions to a non-milk quota situation, increasing scale, or herd size, will probably lead to a trend towards a reduction in grazing, and may lead to a loss of the benefits of grazing. Therefore, strategies are required to increase the level of grazed grass in the diet of dairy cows on high output farms through the integration of grassland measurement and budgeting within everyday grassland management practices. There is a growing body of literature describing the benefits of grazing from an economic, environmental, animal welfare and overall social dimension. However, there are fewer reviews highlighting the constraints and difficulties to maintaining a high level of grass utilisation and good <b>grazing</b> <b>performance</b> in high output systems. The objective of this review is to present a balanced overview of the possibilities and the constraints for grazing in dairy systems in the future...|$|E

During the backgrounding period, crossbred, weanling steers (n = 329; initial BW = 191 ± 5. 52 kg) {{were randomly assigned to}} 1 of 4 DMI levels corresponding to ad libitum, 2. 50 % of BW (2. 50 %), 2. 25 % of BW (2. 25 %), and 2. 00 % of BW (2. 00 %) for 62 d. During the subsequent grazing period, the same steers were randomly assigned to 13 paddocks to graze for 90 d. Paddocks were stocked at 281 kg live weight per hectare. Initial steer BW were similar on each pasture and each backgrounding treatment was equally represented within a paddock. During the feedlot period, steers were finished at a commercial feedlot and were assigned to 1 of 4 pens according to their rank in BW. Entire pens were harvested when average steer BW reached 545 kg. During the backgrounding period, ad libitum-fed steers had greater (P < 0. 001) ADG and final BW than other treatments; steers fed at 2. 50 and 2. 25 % of BW had similar ADG and final BW and were greater (P < 0. 001) than steers fed 2. 00 % of BW. During the grazing period, compensatory gain was observed in restricted DMI treatments. Steers fed at 2. 00 % of BW had greater (P = 0. 006) ADG than ad libitum-fed steers but an ADG {{similar to that of the}} other restricted DMI treatments. Steers fed ad libitum, 2. 50 % of BW, and 2. 25 % of BW had similar final BW and steers fed 2. 00 % of BW had lesser (P < 0. 001) final BW than other treatments.

30|$|The used grazers {{provide an}} {{important}} function for stream ecosystems by controlling the aufwuchs biomass at the streambed [4, 18, 22, 29, 31], which {{is especially important}} during the aufwuchs biomass peak in spring before foliation of deciduous trees to prevent/reduce external biological colmation [30, 50]. A successful provision of this function, however, requires a suitable biomass of grazers [4] at a specific time in spring. The performed experiments revealed specific effects of pesticides during the grazer life cycle, which are able to influence the survival, spatial distribution (drift), growth, and even fecundity (triglycerides) of grazers and, hence, their functional performance in spring. A long-lasting reduction of grazer growth rates during autumn or winter caused by herbicide-induced starvation as observed in the terbutryn experiment may led to a mismatch of the grazer and aufwuchs biomass peak in spring. Furthermore, sublethal effects of insecticides as observed in the LCH experiments are likely to influence the <b>grazing</b> <b>performance</b> either directly, e.g., via feeding inhibition or indirectly by affecting the physiological condition of grazers and, subsequently, their stress tolerance [56] or even fecundity [52]. Of course, the possibility of compensatory growth and recovery after a phase of increased stress, as observed in other studies with aquatic invertebrates [13, 26], needs to be considered. Environmental growth data for the grazer R. semicolorata provide strong indications {{of the existence of}} a compensatory feeding behaviour after starvation [68]. However, such complex interactions are not included in the standard risk assessment and are even difficult to assess in higher tier approaches. Considering that, in a time-shifted exposure scenario with herbicide and insecticides, the final physiological state of grazers after herbicide exposure is the starting point for the insecticide exposure reveals the possibility of a synergistic effect between both exposures and, hence, an even higher complexity. A synergistic effect of the herbicide exposure mediated by the physiological condition of grazers and resulting reduced stress tolerance may increase the risk of grazers during the subsequent insecticide exposure. However, such time-shifted exposures are currently not considered within the regulation process of pesticides. The results of the present experiments strongly indicate that, such scenarios, under consideration of the life-history of the used test organism, can reveal important information to understand the complex effects of pesticides in the aquatic environment. Especially uni- and semivoltine macroinvertebrates, which complex life cycles hampers their regular use for the standard risk assessment of pesticides, seem to be susceptible to time-shifted exposures and may fail to perform their functional role within the aquatic ecosystem.|$|E

The variables of feeding behavior evaluated, and the weight gaining process were highly influenced by the animal performance...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} plant-based factors on the {{population}} dynamics of mammalian herbivores {{has been the subject}} of much debate in ecology, but the role of antiherbivore defences in grasses has received relatively little attention. Silica has been proposed as the primary defence in grasses and is thought to lead to increased abrasiveness of foliage so deterring feeding, as well as reducing foliage digestibility and herbivore performance. However, at present there is little direct experimental evidence to support these ideas. In this study, we tested the effects of manipulating silica levels on the abrasiveness of grasses and on the feeding preference and growth performance of field voles, specialist grass-feeding herbivores. Elevated silica levels did increase the abrasiveness of grasses and deterred feeding by voles. We also demonstrated, for the first time, that silica reduced the growth rates of both juvenile and mature female voles by reducing the nitrogen they could absorb from the foliage. Furthermore, we found that vole feeding leads to increased levels of silica in leaves, suggesting a dynamic feedback between grasses and their herbivores. We propose that silica induction due to vole <b>grazing</b> reduces vole <b>performance</b> and hence could contribute to cyclic dynamics in vole populations...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} were conducted {{to aid in the}} integration of crop and livestock systems. A study was initiated to evaluate the impact of spring corn residue grazing and tillage on subsequent crop yields in a corn-soybean rotation. Crop yields were evaluated for two different stocking rates. Normal stocking rates showed no detrimental impacts of grazing or tillage on subsequent crop yields. At higher stocking rates (2. 5 times normal) grazing increased soybean yields. However, corn yields were depressed under no-tillage 2 years post grazing. The results from this study suggest that producers can maintain livestock on crop acres in the spring if soybeans are planted the subsequent growing season. ^ Another study evaluated transgenic (Corn Rootworm protected and Roundup Ready®) corn and non-transgenic corn for residue <b>grazing.</b> Growth <b>performance</b> of steers <b>grazing</b> corn residue from transgenic corn or their respective non-transgenic control was not different. This demonstrates that the feeding value of corn residue does not differ between transgenic corn hybrids and their parental controls. ^ A trial was conducted to evaluate the effects of increasing levels of salt (NaCl) inclusion on animal performance and feed intake. Cattle were individually fed one of five treatments to include increasing levels of NaCl in the supplement from 0 to 0. 5 % of diet DM. Overall, NaCl supplementation was not effective in increasing animal performance or feed intake. Results suggest that NaCl inclusion in diets is not necessary. ^ An experiment was conducted to evaluate pen cleaning frequency and the impact on nitrogen (N) volatilization during summer months and during composting of manure. Either monthly cleaning (MC) or cleaning pens {{at the end of the}} feeding period (EC) were evaluated. Within cleaning frequency, collected manure was composted with and without sawdust amendment. Monthly cleaning was more effective in recovering N in manure and reducing the overall loss from the pen surface than EC. Nitrogen recovery percentages were similar between pen cleaning treatments following composting and additional sawdust amendment was not beneficial. ...|$|R
40|$|The study {{examined}} perceived {{effects of climate}} change on <b>grazing</b> land, herds’ <b>performance</b> and examined the coping strategies of the pastoralists to climate change. Multi-stage sampling technique was used to select 120 respondents for the study. Data were analyzed using percentages, frequencies, tables and Chi square statistical tools. The result of the study showed that 37. 5 % of the respondents were between the ages of 51 - 60 years with an average age of 49. 8 years. The results revealed that 67. 5 % of the pastoralists strongly agreed that the pattern of rainfall in recent time affects pasture availability. Consequently 47. 5 % and 52. 5 % of them reported a decrease in milk production and increase in herd’s mortality rate respectively due to the effect of climate change. A significance relationship was established between factors of climate change and milk production of the herd (calculated x 2 = 52. 00, tabulated x 2 = 7. 8147. p ? 0. 05). It is therefore recommended that the pastoralists be trained in forage conservation techniques. They should also be encouraged to pool their resources to enjoy economics of scale by the extension workers. Grazing reserves should be developed by the government to fast track the disposition of the pastoralists to sedentary life...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} in Um "Nabag" (15 km north of "Bara"), "Dilling" (160 km south of "Elobeid") and "Eldemiokya" (30 km east of "Elobeid"). The main objective {{of this study is to}} assess the effect of <b>grazing</b> on growth <b>performance</b> of natural rangelands in Kordofan region. The specific objectives: To assess the effect of grazing level on vegetation frequency. The results showed different levels of grazing intensity at different sites as indicated by plants frequency and biomass. Intensive grazing levels were found at Bara in the north, early and late in the rainy season but in Dilling it was not found in the late in the rainy season for both seasons (2008 and 2009) which indicated longer stay of herders in "Bara" area as a rainy season residences. Frequency of the species between non- grazed and grazed areas showed a decrease for the two seasons especially for preferred species at the different sites as in the case of Eragrostis termula and Cenchrus biflorus in (2008),Similar results were observed in (2009) with Fimbirsty dichotomo and Cenchrus biflorus. The study recommended that grazing level can be used as practical mean to assess utilization level as expressed by growth performance indicators including frequency. Level (II) is expected to result in negative impact on rangeland plants growth performance. DOI: [URL] International Journal of Environment Vol. 4 (2) 2015 : 27 - 37 </p...|$|R
40|$|The dairy {{industry}} in Victoria, and indeed agriculture more generally, {{is facing a}} new generation of increasingly complex issues. Problems associated with issues such as the deregulation of markets and sustainable farming practices are ones which seemingly can not be addressed through the application of technology alone. In 1999 a review of human resource development and extension (HRD&E) in Australia's {{dairy industry}} identified that for farmers to be adequately supported in tackling such issues, the HRD&E system required extensive development, particularly in the area of understanding farmer learning. Learning plans were discussed as a possible means by which this could be achieved, however there was much ambiguity associated with this term, particularly for extension practitioners. Thus this project was born and aimed to explore the learning, motivation and change behaviour of dairy farmers in south west Victoria in relation to improving <b>grazing</b> management <b>performance.</b> After a review of the potential paradigms through which this research could be explored, practice theory and the interplay model were found to be the most appropriate, as such an approach enabled the researcher to engage farmers at the level of on farm practice. The underlying epistemological paradigm through which the area of learning plans was explored combined the constructivist and critical theory positions, while the methodologies applied were a collective case study approach, using a Straussian style of grounded theory. Through the interplay model it became clear that for this research to be effective, an improved understanding of farmer learning needed to be examined in terms of the provision of extension services. As such, new theory generated was explored and applied in practice using an action research approach, engaging five extension practitioners from around the state of Victoria. Overall, this research has produced a new model which describes farmer learning as a process of change where action and intention are informed, challenged and balanced by potentially opposing worldviews. The action research phase of the project identified that such learning would be best facilitated through partnerships with extension. Such partnerships involve the practice of extension working towards better understanding the farmers needs as well as the nature of their farming system, and then using this understanding to inform the application of extension resources. The process through which this concept was generated is clearly outlined and discussed, as are the implications that this research presents for the future development of extension in Victoria.

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} {{to determine the effects}} of supplementary concentrate feeding level (Low, LC; High, HC) to grass silage and/or turnout date to pasture in spring (Early, ET; Late, LT) for a second <b>grazing</b> season on <b>performance</b> to slaughter of spring-born, weaned beef calves (n = 188). Experiment 1 comprised of two concentrate levels (0. 5 and 1. 5 kg/day). Experiment 2 comprised of two turnout dates (19 March, 9 April). Experiment 3 comprised of two concentrate levels (0. 5 kg and 2. 0 kg/day) and two turnout dates (22 March, 12 April). In Experiment 1, live-weight gain during the indoor winter period was 25 kg higher (P 0. 05) total live-weight gain for both treatments. In Experiment 2, live weight at turnout to pasture was 11 kg lower (P 0. 05), subsequently. In Experiments 1 and 2, live-weight gain during the finishing period and carcass weight, conformation and fat scores did not differ (P > 0. 05) between the treatments. In Experiment 3, at turnout to pasture, HC were 35 kg heavier (P 0. 05) between the concentrate levels, whereas they were higher (P < 0. 05) for ET than LT. Economic and stochastic analysis of Experiment 3 indicated that, in the context of whole-farm systems, (i) feeding HC was dependent on date of sale such that only where progeny were sold at the start of the second grazing season, net farm margin (NFM) was increased, (ii) ET only increased NFM where progeny were retained through to finish and, (iii) taking progeny through to finish was more profitable than selling earlier in the animals’ lifetime. In conclusion, subsequent compensatory growth at pasture diminishes the growth and economic advantage from concentrate supplementation or early turnout to pasture, of young late-maturing cattle. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The study {{compared}} {{growth and}} slaughter performance and meat quality of organic beef cattle finished {{with or without}} pasture grazing. One group of 10 Limousin heifers was finished under confined conditions and fed ad libitum a total mixed ration based on maize silage, hay and cereal grains. A second group of 10 Limousin heifers rotationally grazed two con-tiguous pasture plots of 1. 5 ha each with a daily supplementation of a concentrate mix based on cereal grains and roasted soybeans. Heifers were slaughtered at commercial fin-ishing and meat quality traits were assessed on Longissimus thoracis muscle. The grazing group, due to a lower average daily gain (0. 74 vs. 0. 95 kg/day; P< 0. 05), required a prolonged finishing period (172 vs. 155 days; P< 0. 05) than the confined animals. Meat samples from grazing cattle were less tender (shear force: 3. 92 vs. 3. 24 kg/cm 2; P< 0. 05) and showed a lower lightness (L*: 33. 0 vs. 35. 8; P< 0. 001) and a higher redness (15. 4 vs. 13. 7; P< 0. 01) and yellowness (15. 6 vs. 14. 6; P< 0. 05). Fatty acid composition of the intramuscular fat was sig-nificantly affected by the finishing system. Grazing heifers had a higher content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (4. 06 vs. 3. 66 % of total fatty acids; P< 0. 05), conjugated linoleic acids (0. 16 vs. 0. 10 % of total fatty acids; P< 0. 01) and ω- 3 (0. 44 vs. 0. 30 % of total fatty acids; P< 0. 001) than confined animals. The detrimental effects of pasture <b>grazing</b> on growth <b>performance</b> and on some important meat quality traits explain the limited adoption of this finishing system in organic beef pro-duction...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{three areas}} of emphasis, all related to feeds, feeding {{and performance of}} small ruminants. The first area (Paper I) focuses on seasonality {{and its effect on}} chemical composition of forage species most preferred by SEA goats, <b>grazing</b> behaviour and <b>performance</b> of goats as assessed in the rainy (February-May), mid dry (July-August) and late dry seasons (October-November). Evaluation of these forages showed a marked decline in quality as the season changed from rainy to dry. The crude protein (CP) and energy content of all forages decreased while the neutral detergent fibre content increased. The decline in feed quality varied with forage class. Unlike forbs and browses, the mean CP of grasses, for example, declined below the critical maintenance level for goats {{from the end of the}} rainy season through late dry season. Mineral concentrations varied among species and forage classes and were all low in phosphorous level. Changes in season were clearly associated with shifts in diet selection, grazing and non grazing activities. Whereas herbaceous vegetation was the main diet in the rainy season, browses and forbs were important dietary sources in the dry season. Observation on <b>grazing</b> activities and <b>performance</b> of goats in the same study showed that the proportion of time allocated for various activities varied with the changing season. For example, feeding time changed from 0. 57 (57 %) in the rainy season to 0. 68 (68 %) in the late dry season. Body weight gains and condition scores were highest in the middle of the dry season while the least performance of these variables was recorded late in the dry season. The second area of this work (Paper II) presents an investigation of the influence of pre-mating dietary supplementation and the season of kidding on reproductive characteristics of SEA goats and growth performance of their off springs. The seasons were either early dry (season 1) or late dry (season 2). Results from three groups of 30 does each subjected to 0, 200 or 400 g of concentrate diet/doe/day for a period of 60 days prior to mating showed that pre-mating dietary supplementation improved (P< 0. 05) weight gains but the reproductive performance was not improved. Doe weight changes and growth rates of kids were affected by the season of kidding. Body weight changes of does, pre-weaning growth and weight of kid weaned per kg doe kidding and the weight of kid weaned per doe kidding were higher for kidding taking place in season 1 compared with that in season 2. Results suggest that production efficiency of goats can be increased by restricting goat breeding activities in January-March for kidding to take place early in the dry season (June-August). The third area (Papers III, IV and V) focused on growth performance, carcass yield and meat quality characteristics of small ruminants when supplemented with concentrate diets with either hay and/or treated straws as basal diets. In Papers III and IV, 32 sheep and goats were subjected to either ad libitum untreated wheat straw (UTS), wheat straw treated with urea and lime (TS), straw and ad libitum hay (UTSH) or TS and ad libitum hay (TSH). In addition, each animal received 220 g of concentrate diet/day (on as fed basis) for 84 days. Treatment of straw increased (P 0. 05). On the other hand, goat meat had slightly higher pH both at 45 min PM and 24 h PM than sheep meat. Post-mortem ageing of sheep meat improved (P 0. 05) on tenderness. Overall, results showed potential for increased productivity in small ruminants through improved nutrition and proper timing of mating periods. Where characteristics of meat quality were assessed, there were limited effects of dietary treatments on such characteristics...|$|R
