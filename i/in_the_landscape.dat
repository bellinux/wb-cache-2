30|$|Productivity {{is higher}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> whereas <b>the</b> low {{rainfall}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape</b> has resulted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> domination of tropical dry thorn forests. The higher fuel loads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical deciduous forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> could be driving <b>the</b> frequent fires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> as <b>the</b> mean fire-return interval is seven times more frequent than for <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape,</b> most fires occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical deciduous forests {{that are found}} at medium elevations, which receive higher rainfall. A few high elevation grassland patches (Sukumar et al. 1995) are also distributed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> <b>The</b> higher dead fuel loads <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical dry thorn forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape</b> {{could be due to}} the higher biotic pressures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> forests (Reddy et al. 2012).|$|R

5|$|Comparisons {{were made}} between Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes, a {{contemporary}} painting {{by one of}} Bierstadt's main rivals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> genre, Frederic Edwin Church. The two works represented the two great mountain ranges spanning North and South America. At the New York Metropolitan Fair in 1864, held by the United States Sanitary Commission {{to raise money for}} the Union war effort, the two paintings were exhibited opposite each other. Lander's Peak and The Heart of the Andes are still exhibited on opposite walls at their current location at the Metropolitan.|$|E
5|$|During the Peninsular War, Portugal fielded light {{infantry}} units {{known as}} Caçadores, who wore brown-jackets which helped conceal them.

5|$|Kentucky Extension specialists suggest {{selecting}} uncommon {{species to}} replace removed ashes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> Previous generations created monocultures by planting ash trees in an overabundance, {{a factor in}} the extent of the devastation caused by the emerald ash borer. Favoring instead a diversity in species helps keep urban forests healthy. University of Kentucky scientists suggest choosing monotypic species such as the pawpaw, yellowwood, Franklin tree, Kentucky coffeetree, Osage orange, sourwood, and baldcypress.|$|E
30|$|The {{weighted}} mean {{mass of the}} total fuel loads was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Total fuels were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical dry deciduous forests and the tropical moist deciduous forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> compared to <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape</b> (Tables 3 and 5).

5|$|Mesa Verdeans used astronomical {{observations}} to plan their farming and religious ceremonies, drawing on both natural features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> and masonry structures built for this purpose.

5|$|The lakes of the BWCAW {{are located}} in {{depressions}} formed by differential erosion of the tilted layers of the Canadian Shield. For the past two million years, massive sheets of ice have repeatedly scoured the landscape. The last glacial period ended with the retreat of the Laurentide Ice Sheet from the Boundary Waters about 17,000 years ago. The resulting depressions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> later filled with water, becoming the lakes of today.|$|E
5|$|While {{designing}} Oblivions {{landscape and}} architecture, developers worked from personal travel photographs, nature books, texture images, and reference photographs. Procedural content generation tools used in production {{allowed for the}} creation of realistic environments at much faster rates than was the case with Morrowind. Erosion algorithms incorporated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> generation tools allowed {{for the creation of}} craggy terrain quickly and easily, replacing Morrowinds artificially smoothed-over terrain.|$|E
5|$|Aveni {{states that}} one of the {{strengths}} of the Brown methodology is that it can explore astronomies invisible to statistical analysis and offers the astronomy of the Incas as another example. The empire of the Incas was conceptually divided using ceques radial routes emanating from the capital at Cusco. Thus there are alignments in all directions which would suggest there is little of astronomical significance, However, ethnohistorical records show that the various directions do have cosmological and astronomical significance with various points <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> being significant at different times of the year. In eastern Asia archaeoastronomy has developed from the History of Astronomy and much archaeoastronomy is searching for material correlates of the historical record. This is due to the rich historical record of astronomical phenomena which, in China, stretches back into the Han dynasty, in the second century BC.|$|E

5|$|In June 1988 the {{producer}} Tim Taylor invited Aston {{to work on}} a new four-episode television series for Channel 4 called Time Signs, broadcast in June and July 1991. The series focused on the historical development of the area about to be flooded by the Roadford Reservoir in Devon, making heavy use of archaeological data. Aston brought archaeologist Phil Harding into the project in order to explain techniques of experimental archaeology to the audience. Meanwhile, in August 1989, Aston was promoted to the position of Reader in Landscape Archaeology at Bristol University. He also continued to write on the subject, authoring the book Monasteries (1993); he had initially planned to title the volume Monasteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Landscape</b> but his publisher, Batsford, had insisted on the shorter title.|$|E
5|$|Plans to link it westwards to the Oakham Canal, northwards to the South Forty-Foot Drain and southwards to the River Nene in 1809 came to nothing, and {{it closed}} in 1863, {{soon after the}} arrival of the Midland Railway in the area. Although Stamford Corporation {{attempted}} to sell it after closure, its ownership was disputed, and they were unable to do so. Its course and some of its structures can still be traced <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> These include warehouses at the terminus in Stamford, and a weir which regulated water levels on the River Gwash, which it crossed on the level.|$|E
5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{determination}} not {{to discriminate}} between European and Third World refugees helped prepare the UNHCR for a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> of internationally displaced persons. During the 1950s, between 200,000 and 300,000 refugees of European origin required assistance. By the 1970s the European refugee problems were mostly solved, but {{had been replaced by}} millions of displaced persons in the Third World. He had widened the UNHCR mandate well beyond its original focus on Eastern Europe, extending the organisation's reach to refugees from the Palestinian territory, Vietnam, Angola and Algeria. As the scale and complexity of refugee issues continued to increase, the UNHCR and the international community at large was better positioned to adapt. By the end of 1977 when he chose to step down from the position, he had become the longest-serving UN High Commissioner for Refugees. He continued to serve in various capacities dealing with humanitarian situations on behalf of the UN.|$|E

30|$|Tropical dry {{forests and}} savannas {{constitute}} {{more than half}} of all tropical forests and grasslands, but little is known about forest fire regimes within these two extensive types of ecosystems. Forest fire regimes in a predominantly dry forest <b>in</b> India, <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> and a predominantly savanna ecosystem <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape,</b> were examined. Remote sensing data were applied to delineate burned areas, determine fire size characteristics, and to estimate fire-rotation intervals. Belt transects (0.5 ha) were used to estimate forest structure, diversity, and fuel loads. Mean area burned, mean number of fires, and mean fire size per year were substantially higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> compared to <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Mean fire-rotational interval was 7.1 yr <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> and 44.1 yr <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Tree (≥ 10 cm diameter at breast height) species diversity, tree density, and basal area were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape</b> compared to <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Total fuel loads were significantly higher in tropical dry and moist deciduous forests <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape,</b> but total fuel loads were higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tropical dry thorn forests of <b>the</b> Sathyamangalam <b>landscape.</b> Thus, <b>the</b> two <b>landscapes</b> revealed contrasting fire regimes and forest characteristics, with more and four-fold larger fires <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Nilgiri <b>landscape.</b> <b>The</b> dry forests and savannas could be maintained by a combination of factors, such as fire, grazing pressures, and herbivore populations. Understanding the factors maintaining these two ecosystems will be critical for their conservation.|$|R

5|$|The {{greens are}} mostly verdigris, {{although}} those predominant <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape</b> are mostly blends {{of blue and}} yellow pigments, and the green of the cloth worn by Mary Salome is malachite mixed with yellow lake. The browns are blends of reds and blacks. John's red robe is composed from cinnabar and vermilion made from rubia and insect dyes. Some of the reds are mixed with earth colours not susceptible {{to the effects of}} light, and have thus survived close to their original appearance. The black pigments are generally bone blacks but in places from charcoal. The blacks are mixed with chalk in areas, producing a red to brownish 'earthy' appearance.|$|E
5|$|The {{positioning}} of these figures closely {{resembles that of}} two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel. In that painting the right-hand figure turns to face his companion, gesturing at him to look outwards. In the van der Weyden, the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend, who here is female, while the left-hand figure in the earlier panel might represent {{a tribute to the}} artist's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s. A red headdress was an indicator of self-portraiture for van Eyck. As in the van Eyck, the figures act as examples of repoussoir, in that they draw our attention to the picture's underlying theme – the painting's ability to visualize the infinity of the world <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>landscape.</b> The painting may allude to the concept of paragone; the man points to the landscape, perhaps highlighting the ability of painting, unlike sculpture, to supply its foreground with background.|$|E
5|$|The {{technical}} investigations Butler {{conducted during}} her tenure resulted in worldwide collaborations and three publications. The {{culmination of the}} research came in 1998 with an exhibition at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The exhibition was small, {{with a handful of}} paintings and a few manuscript leaves. Only two are definitively attributed to the master, the Annunciation, which came from the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., and Saint Barbara, loaned from Antwerp. Two Saint Christophers, one in Philadelphia and the other from the Louvre, are considered to be by workshop members. From Cleveland came a John the Baptist <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Landscape,</b> thought to be by van Eyck followers. The Philadelphia and Turin Saint Francis paintings were both on display, reunited for probably {{the first time since the}} 15th century.|$|E
