2500|$|The {{original}} work in contact mechanics {{dates back to}} 1882 {{with the publication of}} the paper [...] "On the contact of elastic solids" [...] (...) by Heinrich Hertz. Hertz was attempting to understand how the optical properties of multiple, stacked lenses might change with the force holding them together. Hertzian contact stress refers to the localized stresses that develop as two curved surfaces come in contact and deform slightly under the <b>imposed</b> <b>loads.</b> This amount of deformation is dependent on the modulus of elasticity of the material in contact. It gives the contact stress {{as a function of the}} normal contact force, the radii of curvature of both bodies and the modulus of elasticity of both bodies. Hertzian contact stress forms the foundation for the equations for load bearing capabilities and fatigue life in bearings, gears, and any other bodies where two surfaces are in contact.|$|E

With the Oasys Safe finite-element analysis programs, finite-element models were developed to represent a typical stub-type integral abutment bridge configuration and backfill/foundation soil profile. It was found that the behavior of the superstructure of an integral bridge was predominantly influenced by the loading magnitude, irrespective of backfill soil properties.

40|$|The {{multimedia}} enabled Grid (MEG) is {{an extension}} of the Grid concept to support the deployment of multimedia services. To provide an adequate level of service to multimedia applications, it is often necessary to simultaneously allocate the resources including predetermined capacities from the interconnecting networks to the applications. The simultaneous allocation of resources {{is often referred to as}} co-allocation in the Grid literature. In this paper, we propose a novel scheme called synchronous queuing (SQ) for implementing coallocation with quality of service (QoS) assurances in Grids. Unlike existing approaches, SQ does not require advance reservation capabilities at the resources. In the simulation, we increase the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> with increasing number of machines to test SQ's effectiveness in addressing the co-allocation problem. This is because the co-allocation complexity is known to increase with the increase of the <b>imposed</b> <b>load.</b> The simulation studies performed to evaluate SQ indicate that it outperforms an admission control-based scheme by a significant margin...|$|R

A hollow core door is probably the most common example of a torsion box (stressed skin) structure. The principle is to use less material more efficiently. The torsion box uses the properties of its thin surfaces to carry the <b>imposed</b> <b>loads</b> primarily through tension while the close proximity of the enclosed core material compensates for the tendency of the opposite side to buckle under compression.|$|E
50|$|Appropriate design {{factors are}} based on several considerations, such as the {{accuracy}} of predictions on the <b>imposed</b> <b>loads,</b> strength, wear estimates, and the environmental effects to which the product will be exposed in service; the consequences of engineering failure; {{and the cost of}} over-engineering the component to achieve that factor of safety. For example, components whose failure could result in substantial financial loss, serious injury, or death may use a safety factor of four or higher (often ten). Non-critical components generally might have a design factor of two. Risk analysis, failure mode and effects analysis, and other tools are commonly used. Design factors for specific applications are often mandated by law, policy, or industry standards.|$|E

Unexpected catastrophic failure of axles (and wheels) was a problem on all railway vehicles at the time, owing to the lack of understanding of the causes, especially fatigue crack initiation and growth. Crack initiation was usually caused either by defects or poor design, with stress concentrations raising the local stress to failure. The small crack so created would then grow slowly under repeated loading from usage until the axle could no longer withstand <b>imposed</b> <b>loads.</b> (It was noted that the day of the Barnsley Junction accident was very cold and the ballast under the railway sleepers was frozen, increasing the loads on the wheels and axles.) ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractA major {{class of}} work on absorption-based capture systems is the {{prediction}} of separation plant performance for various solvents and solvent mixtures. Typically, equilibrium or rate-based models are used to compute the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> (reduction in net electrical output from a power plant) for separation using a given solvent, possibly optimizing over process parameters (such as stripper pressure). This analysis is frequently repeated for each solvent considered. While this type of work shows the potential of each solvent, it does not predict the performance of solvent-based capture systems in general, nor does any single analysis show how an energetically-optimal solvent would behave. In our modeling approach, we choose a specific process architecture, beginning with a standard absorber/stripper configuration, but do not choose a specific solvent. By adjusting the solvent properties as well as process parameters, we seek to find {{the properties of the}} energetically-optimal solvent for a given process configuration, and the <b>imposed</b> <b>load</b> when using that solvent in that process. We also demonstrate that the accuracy of the steam cycle model can {{have a significant impact on}} the optimization of the capture process...|$|R
