5|$|Chris Chibnall {{wanted to}} write a story that tackled the issue of loss and {{revolved}} around a missing person case. Executive producer Russell T Davies appreciated the character dynamics and domestic themes in the episode and cited the script as one of his inspirations in continuing the series. Ruth Jones, who is generally better known for her comedic roles, was cast against type in the central guest role of Nikki Bevan. The episode was filmed largely on location in South Wales with the island of Flat Holm featuring prominently. Response to the episode was generally positive. Reviewers generally praised the episode for illuminating the conflicting elements of Gwen's character and providing a central dilemma with no <b>easy</b> <b>answer.</b> Some critics identified ostensible plot holes, though felt that the episode's emotional successes negated these.|$|E

And I could no longer thrust it back, or hide its shining face with the dull, leaden mask of mere intellectual curiosity. BECAUSE I LOVED HER; loved her as I had never loved before, never could love any other being, with a passion which had caught something of her own brilliance and intensity, making a former passion look dim and commonplace in comparison--a feeling known to everyone, something old and worn out, a weariness even to think of.|$|E

Without reducing Deleuze’s complex body {{of thought to}} simplistic solutions, this very contemporary guide leads the reader {{into the world of}} Deleuze’s spiralling thought through concrete examples from art, film, TV and even computer games. From Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind and The Cell to Pac Man and Doom, and from the work of Robert Mapplethorpe, Coco Fusco and Rachel Whiteread to Lost and Doctor Who, this easily digestible introduction looks at the key ideas promoted by Deleuze, both in his own work and in his notoriously difficult collaborations with Felix Guattari, to make them both fresh and relevant to the visual arts today...|$|R

[...] These were terrible questions to her,--questions which she could not answer, but yet as to which her mind entertained an <b>easy</b> <b>answer.</b> A little help from him, who was willing to indulge her with so many luxuries while she was under his roof, would enable her to be an assistance rather than a burden to her lover. But of this she could not utter a word. [...] "Love is all very well," [...] continued Sir Thomas, in his gruffest voice; [...] "but love should be regulated by good sense. It is a crime when two beggars think of marrying each other,--two beggars who are not prepared to live as beggars do." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{constant}} bickerings between Hera and Zeus in the Iliad {{are merely}} the {{reflection in the}} upper Olympian world of the wars and jealousies of men below. Ilios is at war with Argos and Mycenae, therefore the chief protecting gods of each city {{take part in the}} strife. This conception is connected with the heroic genealogies. Noble and royal families, as in most countries, feigned a descent from the gods. It followed that Zeus was a partisan of his [...] "children," [...] that is, of the royal houses in the towns where he was the most favoured deity. Thus Hera when she sided with Mycenæ had a double cause of anger, and there is an <b>easy</b> <b>answer</b> to the question, quo numine læso? She had her own townsmen's quarrel to abet, and she had her jealousy to incite her the more; for to become father of the human families Zeus must have been faithless to her. Indeed, in a passage (possibly interpolated) of the fourteenth Iliad he acts as his own Leporello, and recites the list of his conquests. The Perseidæ, the Heraclidæ, the Pirithoidæ, with Dionysus, Apollo and Artemis spring from the amours there recounted.* Moved by such passions, Hera urges on the ruin of Troy, and Zeus accuses her of a cannibal hatred. [...] "Perchance wert thou to enter within the gates and long walls, and devour Priam raw, and Priam's sons, and all the Trojans, then mightest thou assuage thine anger."** That great stumbling-block of Greek piety, the battle in which the gods take part,*** was explained as a physical allegory by the Neo-Platonists.**** It is in reality only a refraction of the wars of men, a battle produced among the heavenly folk by men's battles, as the earthly imitations of rain in the Vedic ritual beget rain from the firmament. The favouritism which Zeus throughout shows to Athene***** is explained by that rude and ancient myth of her birth from his brain after he had swallowed her pregnant mother.****** ...|$|E

40|$|The {{last thirty}} years in the {{analysis}} of inequality and poverty, especially in developing countries, has seen two phases-a phase of conceptual advancement, followed by a phase of application and policy debate. Both phases were exciting and useful in their own way, but the applied phase has significantly exhausted the potential of the conceptual advances of two decades ago, and new advances have been few and far between. However, there is now a need, and an opening, for a new phase of conceptual advances, advances that will make use of shifting methodological terrain in mainstream economics, and that will answer emerging policy questions that would otherwise have no <b>easy</b> <b>answers</b> (or, perhaps, too <b>easy</b> <b>answers).</b> Food Security and Poverty,...|$|R
