However, research to determine <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aceh <b>Scholarship</b> and <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fund has not been done. This study examines <b>the</b> extent <b>of</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> Aceh 2 ̆ 7 s <b>scholarship</b> management and <b>the</b> contribution <b>of</b> recipients to Aceh 2 ̆ 7 s development. For this purpose, interviews {{with a number of}} stakeholders involved, such as fund managers and scholarship recipients and managers, and document analyses were conducted. The results show that while there are still many problems, LPSDM has made a number of breakthroughs to help students to study at a number of universities using Acehnese <b>scholarships.</b> Furthermore, <b>the</b> alumni have also contributed greatly to Aceh, especially through the institutions where they work...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} {{distinct}} and complementary objectives {{in this article}} in order to clarify the higher education outline in Brazil, specifically evening courses (classes are held on weekdays, generally from 7 : 00 pm to 10 : 30 pm) and thesecurrent sector policies. The first objective is to present a short historical overview on <b>the</b> establishment <b>of</b> evening courses in Brazil, including those in the higher education level, occurred on <b>the</b> middle <b>of</b> last century. <b>The</b> second objective is to demonstrate <b>the</b> growth <b>of</b> evening higher education in Brazil, considering that in 1998, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 2. 1 million college enrollments, 55. 3 % were enrolled in evening courses; in 2010, twelve years later, <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 5. 4 million students enrolled, there were 63. 5 % enrolled in evening courses. This expansion is due to <b>the</b> growing need <b>of</b> many students who must work while attending college, to defray costs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> study as well as personal and family costs. <b>The</b> reality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> working student is hostile considering external factors, such as transport problems, public security and lack of legislation for flexible working hours. The third objective is to discuss current public policies to expand eveningopenings in public institutions which represent nowadays only 16. 1 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 3. 4 million enrollments for evening classes, including federal (6. 8 %), state (7. 0 %) and municipal (2. 3 %) institutions. In the third objective it is included <b>the</b> discussion <b>of</b> programs for scholarships and tuition loans. The methodology applied was to rescue historical information on the establishment and <b>the</b> expansion <b>of</b> evening courses in Brazil, analyzing the current general Brazilian policies and the specific ones from <b>the</b> State <b>of</b> São Paulo. <b>The</b> research results pointed to <b>the</b> importance <b>of</b> federal programs for scholarships and tuition loans for students from private {{institutions such as the}} 1, 382, 484 scholarships since 2004 (PROUNI Program) and the 847, 000 tuition loans since 1999 (FIES Program). Important steps have been made by the Brazilian government. Considering that there are 3, 987, 424 enrollments in private institutions, <b>the</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> programs for <b>scholarships</b> and tuition loans is still insufficient to meet the universal benefits for the student’s needs. Evening courses became <b>the</b> real instrument <b>of</b> social inclusion for many Brazilian youths and must be expanded quantitatively and qualitatively, with aggressive public policies, including also, scholarships and tuition loans...|$|R

Additionally, within each function, there are descriptions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> publications submitted, and, where relevant, the overlapping and linked work on the Masters in Teaching English to Young Learners.
