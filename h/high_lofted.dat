5000|$|An ultra lob wedge is a {{specialization}} of the lob wedge with {{an extremely}} <b>high</b> <b>loft,</b> as <b>high</b> as 70°. Synonyms are generally marketing terms and include the [...] "flop wedge" [...] and [...] "final wedge". When {{included in a}} club set, it generally has the <b>highest</b> <b>loft</b> of the set. It is used for specialized, extremely high-angle shots such as from the [...] "lip" [...] of a bunker. This wedge is generally made by specialty companies, and some argue that their purpose is redundant, as a regular lob wedge can be [...] "opened" [...] for extra loft in situations calling for such a high launch angle. However, these shots are very tricky to make as they require substantial changes to a player's normal swing mechanics.|$|R
5000|$|The modern sand wedge still {{uses the}} ideas of <b>high</b> mass, <b>high</b> <b>loft,</b> and bounce angle, but the modern sand wedge clubhead has much higher mass than earlier designs, up to 40oz (2.5 lb, 1.13 kg), to drive the clubhead through the firmer sand found in many courses. There can also be {{differences}} in shaft length; while some sand wedges follow the systematic progression of shorter shaft lengths for <b>higher</b> <b>lofts,</b> many sand wedges are longer than the adjacent lofted wedges. This encourages the player to hit sand wedge shots [...] "fat" [...] (the club hits the ground before the ball), which on a firm lie is generally bad, {{but in the case}} of a ball embedded or buried in soft bunker sand this will get the clubhead all the way under the ball to lift it out. The resulting plume of sand from such a shot was made famous by Sarazen as the [...] "explosion shot" [...] and is a common sight in televised golf events.|$|R

50|$|The modern sand wedge {{is often}} the {{heaviest}} iron in a player's bag, with most weighing nearly 40 oz. Traditionally it also had the <b>highest</b> <b>loft</b> at 56 degrees (55-56 being most common), although that distinction now goes to the lob wedge, which often has a loft of 60 degrees or more. It usually {{has one of the}} shortest shafts, between 33 in and 36 in, though in some sets the sand wedge has a longer shaft than the pitching wedge.|$|R
5000|$|These irons are {{typically}} easier to hit well than the long irons, owing to their <b>higher</b> <b>loft</b> {{which gives the}} clubs more surface area. These clubs are more often found as true irons in players' bags, meaning they're less often replaced with hybrid clubs or other [...] "iron replacements". These irons often have graphite shafts in newer sets, even when shorter irons have steel; the graphite will give better distance for the average golfer {{at the cost of}} some loss of consistency due to shaft torquing.|$|R
5000|$|The typical loft for woods {{ranges from}} 7.5 to 31 degrees. Driver lofts {{generally}} center around 10.5° but the desired loft is very {{dependent upon the}} player's swing speed (low swing speeds need <b>higher</b> lofts); men's <b>lofts</b> vary between 8 and 11 degrees while women's drivers are between 10 and 13 degrees, and seniors' lofts trend toward the upper range by gender. The average 3-wood has a 13-16 degree loft (typically 15°) and the average 5-wood has an 18-21 degree <b>loft.</b> <b>Higher</b> <b>lofts</b> than that overlap with irons in distance, but many players prefer high-number woods to low-number irons wherever {{they can be used}} as the wood is easier to hit than a [...] "long iron". The loft of any given club number varies between manufacturers, model lines, and the target player.|$|R

40|$|When {{measuring}} the sliding friction on highly compliant {{materials such as}} fabric batting and foam rubber, {{a substantial portion of}} the apparent friction is due to the deformation of the substrate. A new friction instrument consisting of a sled within a sled has been developed that eliminates the contribution of this deformation and provides the true sliding friction as well as the force required to deform the substrate. The friction coefficient as measured using a conventional steel sled sliding on <b>high</b> <b>loft</b> polyester batts increased as the number of polyester batts increased. Using the new, guarded friction sled, the friction coefficient was independent of the number of supporting batts, thus separating the deformation forces from the sliding forces...|$|R

5000|$|Irons are {{the most}} common type of club; a {{standard}} set of 14 golf clubs will usually contain between 7 and 11 irons, including wedges. Irons are customarily differentiated by a number from 1 to 10 (most commonly 3 to 9) that indicates the relative angle of loft on the clubface, although a set of irons will also vary in clubhead size, shaft length, and hence lie angle as the loft (and number) increase. Irons with <b>higher</b> <b>loft</b> than the numbered irons are called wedges, which are typically marked with a letter indicating their name, and are used for a variety of [...] "utility" [...] shots requiring short distance and/or a high launch angle.|$|R
5000|$|Wedges are a {{subclass}} of irons with <b>higher</b> <b>loft</b> than numbered irons, {{used for}} a variety of specialized [...] "utility" [...] shots that require short distance (typically less than 130 yards), high launch angle, and/or high backspin to reduce roll distance. The first wedge to have that name was the sand wedge, invented by Gene Sarazen in 1931, which features a wide sole that is angled complementary to the striking face to help prevent the clubhead digging into soft turf such as sand. This wide sole was added to other high-lofted irons to add mass to the clubhead (compensating for the shorter shafts) and gives wedges their name, alluding to the clubs' appearance in profile.|$|R

3000|$|Throughout the USC {{innovative}} {{practices were}} implemented for natural air-conditioning (chilled water to supply cool buildings), <b>high</b> <b>loft</b> ceilings designed for {{natural air circulation}} and prominent thermal chimneys on most buildings (Online Resource 4) [...]. Many of these structures have odd shapes and unexpected angles including the ‘J’ building and the art gallery tilting dangerously to one side (Online Resource 5). These strange forms and dissonant beauty as a displacement of convention as well as stylistic pluralism are typical of postmodern architecture [2]. Diversity in architectural styles at the USC has a connotative secondary function, mirroring complexity and pluralism inherent to the late capitalist society, as well as reflecting {{the notion that the}} culture has no unified sense of direction.|$|R
50|$|An {{important}} {{variation in}} different clubs is loft, or the angle between the club's {{face and the}} vertical plane. It is loft that is the primary determinant of the ascending trajectory of the golf ball, with the tangential angle of the club head's swing arc at impact being a secondary and relatively minor consideration (though these small changes in swing angle can nevertheless have a significant influence on launch angle when using low-lofted clubs). The impact of the club compresses the ball, while grooves on the club face give the ball backspin. Together, the compression and backspin create lift. The majority of woods and irons are labeled with a number; higher numbers indicate shorter shafts and <b>higher</b> <b>lofts,</b> which give the ball a higher and shorter trajectory.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the sport}} of golf, a wedge is {{a subset of the}} iron family of golf clubs {{designed}} for special use situations. As a class, wedges have the <b>highest</b> <b>lofts,</b> the shortest shafts, and the heaviest clubheads of the irons. These features generally aid the player in making accurate short-distance [...] "lob" [...] shots, to get the ball onto the green or out of a hazard or other tricky spot. In addition, wedges are designed with modified soles that aid the player in moving the clubhead through soft lies, such as sand, mud, and thick grass, to extract a ball that is embedded or even buried. [...] Wedges {{come in a variety of}} configurations, and are generally grouped into four categories; pitching wedges, sand wedges, gap/approach wedges and lob wedges.|$|R
5000|$|The 8 and 9 irons are {{commonly}} called the [...] "short irons". They have the highest-mass clubheads and the shortest shafts of the numbered irons, {{and are used}} for shots requiring <b>high</b> <b>loft</b> and/or moderate to short distance (typically between 130 and 150 yards with a full swing). Shots that must carry over tall and/or nearby obstacles such as a stand of trees, or approach shots from inside 140 yards of the pin, are common short iron situations. The short irons also make good [...] "bump and run" [...] clubs; used with a putting motion from the fringe around the green, the ball will carry in the air a few yards over the thick grass that would hamper a putt, then land softly on the green where it will then roll for a distance like a putt.|$|R
5000|$|An ultra lob wedge {{is used to}} hit a {{shot with}} higher and shorter {{trajectory}} than a standard lob wedge. This club is labeled [...] "UL" [...] and has a loft of about 64° and has the <b>highest</b> <b>loft</b> of any golf club. It is used for specialized, extremely high-angle shots such as from the [...] "lip" [...] of a bunker. This wedge is generally made by speciality companies and some argue that their purpose is redundant, as other wedges can be [...] "opened" [...] for extra loft in situations calling for such a high launch angle. Furthermore, to get consistent results, this club requires skill - in particular, distance judgement is always key with such a lofted club. It can be noted that different lengths of swing will often yield a similar distance but with varying trajectories and thus roll (on the green).|$|R
5000|$|Within {{the range}} of lofts seen in gap wedges, the angle that the sole makes to the ground at address, {{also known as the}} club's [...] "bounce angle", varies from 0° up to 12° or more. Lower lofts {{typically}} benefit from a lower bounce angle, suiting their use as effectively an [...] "11-iron" [...] for shots from firmer lies such as grass. <b>Higher</b> <b>lofts,</b> generally used from softer lies where the ball may have dug itself in more, require a higher bounce similar to the sand wedge to dig in and then lift back out of the ground. The most common 52° wedge is sold {{in a wide range of}} bounce angles; 8° is a common [...] "medium bounce" [...] choice, allowing the golfer to use the club in a variety of lies, from the fairway or rough to [...] "fried egg" [...] semi-embedded sand or mud situations.|$|R
40|$|Nanofiber {{technology}} (fiber diameter {{less than}} 1 micrometer) is under development for future Army lightweight protective clothing systems. Nanofiber applications for ballistic and chemical/biological protection are being actively investigated, but the thermal properties of nanofibers {{and their potential}} protection against cold environments are relatively unknown. Previous {{studies have shown that}} radiative heat transfer in fibrous battings is minimized at fiber diameters between 5 and 10 micrometers. However, the radiative heat transfer mechanism of extremely small diameter fibers of less than 1 micrometer diameter is not well known. Previous studies were limited to glass fibers, which have a unique set of thermal radiation properties governed by the thermal emissivity properties of glass. We are investigating the thermal transfer properties of <b>high</b> <b>loft</b> nanofiber battings composed of carbon fiber and various polymeric fibers such as polyacrylonitrile, nylon, and polyurethane. Thermal insulation battings incorporating nanofibers could decrease the weight and bulk of current thermal protective clothing, and increase mobility for soldiers in the battlefield...|$|R
5000|$|The {{pitching}} wedge is {{descended from}} the [...] "niblick", an obsolete blade-style club with a <b>high</b> <b>loft.</b> As the older naming system gave way to numbered sets in the mid- to late 1930s, the standardization of loft angles led to a split in the niblick's normal range of lofts, to create the 9-iron (with a loft {{at the time of}} about 48-50°) and a new club lofted around 52-54°. Some manufacturers such as MacGregor kept with the numbering system and labelled this club the [...] "10-iron", while other makers, seeking to capitalize on the usefulness of this club in the [...] "short game", named the club the [...] "pitching wedge" [...] to associate it with the relatively new sand wedge and its similar utility for close-in shots. The term [...] "pitching wedge" [...] is now used by virtually all manufacturers and players to describe this club; Karsten Manufacturing (maker of the PING brand) simply labels their pitching wedges [...] "W" [...] for [...] "wedge".|$|R
5000|$|Lob wedges {{are part}} of the iron family of golf clubs and are {{designed}} for short, high arc shots. [...] Lob wedges and ultra lob wedges are designed with the shortest shafts and the <b>highest</b> <b>loft</b> of all golf clubs. [...] Regular lob wedges may {{come in a variety of}} lofts, usually starting around 56 degrees and approaching 60. While those above 60 degrees are rare, often up to 64 degrees, they do exist and are referred to as [...] "x-wedges", extreme lob wedges or ultra lob wedges. [...] Other differences between the lob wedge and the rest of the wedge family include the less pronounced flange on the sole allowing the club to slide under the ball more easily and less degrees of bounce (often between 0-10 degrees). [...] The low bounce was designed out of the necessity of professionals who found that the higher bounce sand wedge was making it difficult to produce the spin they desired, especially out of tight lies ...|$|R
5000|$|Woods are {{numbered}} {{in ascending order}} starting with the driver, or 1-wood, which has the lowest loft (usually between 9 and 13 degrees), and continuing with progressively <b>higher</b> <b>lofts</b> and numbers. Most modern woods are sold as individual clubs allowing the player to customize their club set, but matched sets of woods, especially {{as part of a}} complete club set, are readily available. Odd-numbered lofts are most common in players' bags, though 2- and 4-woods are available in many model lines. The number of the club is mainly a reference for the player to easily identify the clubs; the actual loft angle of a particular number varies between manufacturers, and there is often some overlap of lofts (one 3-wood might be higher-lofted than a 4-wood of a different brand or model). Other identifiers have been utilized such as [...] "strong" [...] and [...] "plus" [...] to differentiate various lofts within a line of clubs.|$|R
50|$|Initially {{performing}} {{under the}} name Country Boy Calhoun, he soon {{established himself as a}} feature attraction, performing in various regional territories, including Houston, Kansas City, and even Canada. However, he first appeared nationally on Art Linkletter’s House Party, a televised variety show where Calhoun’s strength was showcased as he tossed full bales of hay into a <b>high</b> <b>loft.</b> As a result of this feat, he adopted the name Haystacks Calhoun. Recognizing the show business potential of such a gimmick, Calhoun decided to exaggerate his hillbilly persona by adopting the fictional birthplace of Morgan’s Corner, Arkansas while sporting a bushy beard, white t-shirt, blue overalls, and a genuine horseshoe around his neck on a chain. Despite his imposing size, Calhoun was a mild-mannered country boy and he became a fan favorite. Moreover, while promoters typically did not book him for championships, he seldom lost a match. He was often booked in special attraction bouts, competing in handicap matches and battle royals, {{in much the same way}} that André the Giant would be booked a few decades later.|$|R
50|$|Irons are clubs with a solid, {{all-metal}} head {{featuring a}} flat angled face, and a shorter shaft and more upright lie angle than a wood, {{for ease of}} access. Irons are designed {{for a variety of}} shots from all over the course, from the tee box on short or dog-legged holes, to the fairway or rough on approach to the green, to tricky situations like punching through or lobbing over trees, getting out of hazards, or hitting from tight lies requiring a compact swing. Most of the irons have a number from 1 to 9 (the numbers in most common use are from 3 to 9), corresponding to their relative loft angle within a matched set. Irons are typically grouped according to their intended distance (which also roughly corresponds to their shaft length and thus their difficulty to hit the ball); in the numbered irons, there are long irons (2-4), medium irons (5-7), and short irons (8-9), with progressively <b>higher</b> <b>loft</b> angles, shorter shafts, and heavier club heads.|$|R
5000|$|Higher-number woods are {{generally}} known as fairway woods and, as their name suggests, {{are designed for}} shots from off the turf of the fairway that still require long distance, such as the second shot of a par-5 or a long par-4 hole. They have two important features: a <b>higher</b> <b>loft</b> to lift {{the ball out of}} the turf and over low obstacles like hills, and a shallower face height which allows a player to hit a ball from the ground using the exact center of the club, providing greater distance for such shots. These two design features enable players to hit fairway woods off the ground with greater ease than modern deep-faced drivers. Fairway woods are also useful off the tee depending on the hole; players may for instance wish to play their tee shot short (known as [...] "laying up") due to a dogleg or a hazard in range of their driver, and will opt instead for their 3-wood. Fairway woods are typically made with a slightly shorter and stiffer shaft, a smaller clubhead and more loft than a driver or 2-wood.|$|R
5000|$|Traditional sets of golf irons did {{not always}} include the lob wedge. Before 1931, golfers used a single wedge, known as a [...] "jigger", similar to the modern day {{pitching}} wedge. After 1931, additional wedges entered the golf bag starting with the sand wedge. [...] The lob wedge was first envisioned by Dave Pelz, a former physicist for NASA, who recognized the need for <b>higher</b> <b>loft</b> wedges (at the time 60 degrees) due to the increasing complexity of the putting greens being designed at the time. This concept was {{taken up by the}} professional golfer Tom Kite, who began using the lob wedge professionally on tour spurring other professionals to follow his lead. The mainstream lob wedge was invented by Karsten Solheim, the founder of the PING line of golf products, possibly after experimenting by gluing a potato chip to a straw. [...] Solheim was also responsible for naming the club the [...] "L Wedge" [...] or the [...] "Lob Wedge" [...] as it is currently known today.|$|R

50|$|Most irons in a player's bag are {{labelled}} with {{a number}} indicating their loft; the higher the number, the <b>higher</b> the <b>loft.</b> A matched set of irons will have a regular, progressive increase in loft through the irons, which may differ from set to set due to other design considerations that can affect launch angle and distance. Irons have been seen ranging in number from 0 through 12, but the most common number range in the modern iron set is 3 to 9.|$|R
