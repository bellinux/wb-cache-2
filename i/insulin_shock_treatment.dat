40|$|Histochemical {{investigation}} {{of the problems of}} adrenal medullary physiology has been hampered by the lack of a histochernical technique for the differential visualization of the secretory products of this tissue, adrenaline and noradrenaline. Recently Hillarp and H#{ 246 }kfelt (8), utilizing potassium iodate oxidation, have devised a simple technique making possible the identification of noradrenaline in tissue sections. Using this technique Hillarp and Hflkfelt (10) demonstrated the existence of separate cells containing noradrenaline in the adrenal medulla of a number of species and show’ed that the amount of noradrenaline measured chemically paralleled the percentage of cells hist. ochemically positive for nor-adrenaline. These same investigators (9) demonstrated the release of adrenaline (histochemically and chemically measured) from rat adrenal medulla following <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> <b>treatment,</b> vhile the amount of noradrenaline remained unchanged from normal levels. These results suggest that the cells demonstrable with potassium iodate oxidation do not represent merely secretory phases of a common cell type but are, in fact, specific noradrenaline-secreting cells.

40|$|T H E {{report by}} MacBryde and Roberts x {{concerning}} the clinical {{use of a}} new type of modified protamine zinc insulin in the treatment of diabetic patients with excellent results moved us to use it in clinical trial in a small number of selected cases. It is well known that for the great majority of diabetics, crystalline zinc insulin if divided in- proper doses, or commercial protamine zinc insulin (PZI) with convenient shifts of carbohydrate allotments in the diet, will suffice. There are, however, a certain number of patients that cannot be controlled by this means, especially when they require large doses of PZI. Liberation of insulin from PZI is essentially. steady during 24 hours and its effect lasting more than one day does not keep pace with the needs in these cases. PZI lacks elasticity to prevent post-prandial hyperglycemia with con-sequent glycosuria and nocturnal hypoglycemia with danger and incon-venience of <b>insulin</b> <b>shock.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of these cases with combined use of crystalline and protamine insulins did not easily overcome the difficulties.

40|$|Objective: Since insulin stimulates {{nitric oxide}} (NO) {{production}} {{and an increase}} in NO following heat shock is required for myocardial heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) synthesis, we hypothesized that insulin would enhance myocardial Hsp 70 synthesis by augmenting NO signaling. We examined whether a physiologic dose of insulin increased myocardial Hsp 70 in unstressed and heat shock treated rats. Methods: Adult male Sprague–Dawley rats were assigned to groups: (1) control, (2) insulin injected (200 mU/gm body weight), (3) heat shock treated (core body temperature 42 8 C for 15 min), (4) heat <b>shock</b> and <b>insulin</b> treated, (5) L-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) and heat <b>shock</b> and <b>insulin</b> treated, (6) sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and heat <b>shock</b> and <b>insulin</b> treated. Six hours later, myocardial Hsp 70 content and localization was analyzed. Results: Hsp 70 was increased in heat shock treated hearts (120. 6 ^ 16. 8 ng/mg protein, P, 0 : 001) vs. control (12. 9 ^ 2. 0 ng/mg protein), or insulin treated hearts (15. 5 ^ 0. 83 ng/mg protein). In addition, Hsp 70 was increased in the heat <b>shock</b> and <b>insulin</b> treated hearts (164. 4 ^ 7. 53 ng/mg protein) compared to control, insulin only ðP 0 : 001 Þ; or heat shock only treated hearts ðP 0 : 01 Þ: L-NAME did not abolish the insulin induced increase in Hsp 70 in heat shocked hearts (195. 2 ^ 13. 4 ng/mg protein, P 0 : 21) and SNP did not further enhance Hsp 70 in the <b>insulin</b> and heat <b>shocked</b> group (188. 9 ^ 8. 2 ng/mg protein, P 0 : 71). Western analysis and confocal microscopy revealed a lowlevel expression of myocardial Hsp 70 in response to insulin.

2500|$|In modern times, <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> {{therapy and}} lobotomies {{are viewed as}} being almost as barbaric as the Bedlam [...] "treatments", {{although}} the <b>insulin</b> <b>shock</b> therapy was still seen as the only option which produced any noticeable effect on patients.

Elsewhere, particularly in India, use of ECT is reportedly increasing, as a cost-effective alternative to drug treatment. The effect of a shock on an overly excitable patient often allowed these patients to be discharged to their homes, which was seen by administrators (and often guardians) as a preferable solution to institutionalisation. Lobotomies were performed in the hundreds from the 1930s to the 1950s, and were ultimately replaced with modern psychotropic drugs.|$|R
