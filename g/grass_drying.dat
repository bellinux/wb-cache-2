50|$|Dagaa/mukene/omena from Lake Victoria is an {{important}} fish in the diet of people in eastern and southern Africa. The fish is caught during moonless nights {{and in the morning}} it is sold to women who spread it out for drying in the sun. This takes one day or more, depending on the weather. Unfortunately, the best catches are made during the rainy season when drying is difficult resulting in lower quality of the dried product. The lowest quality is however still usable as chicken feed. Drying is often done on the sand, on rocks or on old nets spread on the <b>grass.</b> <b>Drying</b> racks have not caught on, neither have salting or smoking. The dried fish is packed in sacks and traders take the fish to the market. A major wholesale market for dried dagaa is in Mwanza, Tanzania, from where it is transported all over eastern and southern Africa for use as food or chicken feed. Sometimes it competes with dried kapenta which is usually preferred though more expensive.|$|E

Biochar Pilot Program’s operations. From feedstock to farm, with lots of twists and turns in between.

Extending the Frontiers of High-Moisture Feedstocks for Biochar Reactors: Brian Von Herzen, The Climate Foundation [URL] The Climate Foundation and Stanford University developed a prototype biochar reactor for high-moisture content materials such as human solid waste (HSW). The reactor architecture is intended to sanitize waste from hundreds of people per day, and to be deployed in developing nations and operate with neither external electric power nor external water supply. A further goal is to produce biochar for use in agriculture. Here we report on a larger reactor that Climate Foundation is developing for field trials in Nairobi, Kenya in early 2014. Reactor construction and operation will be discussed, along with demonstration results. We expect this scaled biochar reactor to produce electricity and process heat as well as biochar.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to analyze the botanical composition, grass production, carrying capacity, and potential production of nutrients in pasture located in Timor Tengah Selatan Regency. The experiment was conducted from February to July 2013, using field survey method. The botanical composition, grass production and carrying capacity on real condition were analyzed descriptively, while the grass production and carrying capacity based of cutting arrangement were analyzed by using randomized block factorial design with 3 altitude locations (Sub District of Mollo Utara with altitude of 1007 m above sea level; Sub District of Noebeba, 500 m ASL, and Sub District of Amanuban Selatan, 65 m ASL) x 2 cutting intervals (1 and 2 month) and 5 replications. The results showed that the grass type dominated the pasture in the Sub District of Mollo Utara, while legum type was more dominant in the pasture in the Sub Districts of Noebeba and Amanuban Selatan. The potential production of <b>dry</b> matter <b>grass</b> in Timor Tengah Selatan Regency based on real condition was 150 to 390 kg/ha/yr, this could accommodate 0. 24 to 0. 63 AU/ha/yr. The arrangement of cutting interval by 1 month in Mollo Utara and 2 months in Noebeba and Amanuban Selatan could increase (P< 0. 05) grass production and carrying capacity. The potential productions of grass nutrients were higher in Sub District of Mollo Utara, while potential production of <b>grass</b> <b>dry</b> matter was higher in Sub Districts of Noebeba and Amanuban Selatan.
