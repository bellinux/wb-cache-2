40|$|Our work is {{concerned}} with the scheduling problem for medium sized (5 - 10 machines or workplaces) flexible manufacturing systems which are part of a larger production process. A two-layer control structure for the overall control problem is considered. The general philosophy is to divide the scheduling problem into a number of local decentralized problems: the optimal sequencing and routing of the jobs within flexible manufacturing system or small workshops. The subsystems are coordinated by an upper level scheduler. <b>It</b> <b>assignes</b> the due dates for the completion of operations in the subsystems and determines the earliest possible starting times from the dependencies among the operations and the externally determined starting conditions. The predominant goal of the local on-line scheduling algorithms must be the minimization of the lateness of the local jobs, despite the inevitable disturbing factors. The better this goal is achieved (under the restriction of efficient use of the availab le ressources), the easier is the coordination of the subsystems. We therefore investigate in this paper the behaviour of local on-line scheduling algorithms. The local control laws are based on priority rules augmented by look-ahead strategies. Their effectivity is compared for a real-world example...|$|E
40|$|The main {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} to discover what role the SNS (Social Network Sites) and the Internet play in lives of today's teenagers. Primarily, how much time this age group devotes to those phenomenons mentioned above, what importance <b>it</b> <b>assignes</b> to them and what attitude teenagers, their parents and teachers assume to risks bound to life in an online world. The theoretical framework of the thesis is based on, apart from setting this topic into the historical context {{of the evolution of}} the Internet and SNS, most importantly on the work of danah boyd, Sonia Livingstone and Zeynep Tufekci. There are, among others, distinguished the types of SNS, analysed the reasons for using the SNS, described the most frequent risks associated with use of the Internet, but also clarified some of the rumours and myths usualy connected with the online world. Moreover, in the theoretical part I introduce the actual deviding of SNS according to the extent of anonymity of the users of Anonymous SNS, Quasi-Anonymous SNS and Non-Anonymous SNS. This deviding is based on the application of internal institutions according to Stefan Voigt in the Internet environment. The research part, based on a quantitative survey (n= 543), analyses the situation of the Czech teenagers studying at secondary grammar schools in [...] ...|$|E

The primary policy objective was to ensure equal and relatively efficient distribution of limited grain among consumers and industrial users, and to ensure the growth of grain production at the planned rate.
