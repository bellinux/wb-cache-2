40|$|In a {{conventional}} dry grind process, corn is processed to produce ethanol {{and a low}} valued animal food coproduct called distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS). Approximately 33 % of corn in dry grind ethanol plant becomes DDGS. Due to its high fiber content DDGS has traditionally being sold as ruminant foodstuffs. New fractionation technologies are being implemented to recovery valuable coproducts, reduce amount of DDGS produced and improve fermentation efficiency in conventional dry grind ethanol plants. These technologies include corn fractionation as well as DDGS fractionation. Corn fractionation can be broadly classified as wet and dry technologies. Wet fractionation involves a short soaking of corn followed by milling to recover germ, pericarp fiber and/or endosperm fiber in an aqueous medium prior to fermentation of degermed defibered slurry. In dry fractionation, a dry <b>degerm</b> defiber process is used to separate germ and pericarp fiber prior to fermentation of the endosperm fraction. Both wet and dry processes reduce {{the total amount of}} DDGS produced, increase it protein content and reduce its fiber content. Depending upon the modified process used, the amount of DDGS produced can be reduced by 70 % and its protein content can be increased to 58 %. DDGS fractionation involves sieving and elutriation (aspiration) to separate fiber from DDGS. This process recovers fiber as a coproduct, increases protein and fat content of residual DDGS and reduces the fiber content of residual DDGS. Depending upon the parameters used this process increased protein and fat contents of residual DDGS from 28 to 41 % and 12 to 14 %, respectively. A reduction in fiber content and increase in protein content of DDGS could allow increased use of DDGS as nonruminant foodstuffs...|$|E
40|$|The {{rationale}} of <b>degerming</b> procedures is {{the elimination}} of undesirable microorganisms from sites serving as potential starting points for the transmission of infections, eg, secretions, excretions, and vehicles. The significance of transmission of infection is well-established for some sites, such as the hands, but debatable for others such as surfaces.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the ability of}} corn germ to withstand the fuel ethanol fermentation process without major damage to germ integrity and germ oil quality, five treatments were designed to explore <b>degerming</b> before fermentation (front-end) and after fermentation (tail-end), and the feasibility of breaking the kernel with minimum shear forces (wet-split). Germ from low-shear (wet-split) tail-end <b>degerming</b> maintained its integrity during the process. The wet-grind pretreatment caused 22 % germ damage, and the subsequent fermentation caused 18 % additional germ damage. The germ recovered after fermentation showed physical strength {{similar to that of}} those isolated by wet means before fermentation. The oils extracted from the tail-end germ fractions had the same low free fatty acid (FFA) content (2 %) and similar low peroxide value (2 meq/kg) as those extracted at the front end. The good oil quality of the tail-end germ fraction was attributed to excellent germ integrity. The oil recovered after traditional dry-grind ethanol production was highly deteriorated, with 22 % FFAs and 9 meq/kg peroxide value because the germ was broken into small pieces during dry grinding. So long as kernel-breakage or size-reduction pretreatments are conducted to retain intact germs or keep them in large pieces before fermentation, the germ can survive the cooking, starch hydrolysis, and yeast metabolism during the ethanol fermentation process. These findings lay a foundation for developing new <b>degerming</b> strategies where the germ can be isolated during or after fermentation, which could be easily integrated into the conventional dry-grind corn ethanol process...|$|R

40|$|The {{process of}} red sorghum malt {{production}} was monitored {{three times in}} five production units (PU) selected upon their ability to produce malt flours having a high capacity to fluidify high-energy-density gruels. Raw, germinated and <b>degermed</b> seeds were analysed for macronutrient, soluble sugars, phytate and cyanide contents and alpha-amylase activity. Know-how differences between producers lay mainly in the duration and type of equipment used for steeping and germination. Moreover, three PUs applied a maturation step before sun-drying and one PU added ashes to steeped seeds before germination. No significant difference was detected in the proximate composition of malts from the five PUs. For all PUs, traditional malting increased the protein content and decreased the lipid and ash contents, while the fibre content was not affected. Significant increases in sugar contents and in alpha-amylase activity were observed but in variable proportions from one PU to another. The phytate content decreased significantly in all PUs. The cyanide content increased in all PUs but more drastically or less drastically according to the PU. Finally, <b>degerming</b> lowered the cyanide content to an acceptable level for human consumption. The between-PU variability may be due either to the nature and origin of the raw seeds or to technological know-how differences between producers.

50|$|An {{important}} {{problem of}} the industrial revolution was the preservation of flour. Transportation distances and a relatively slow distribution system collided with natural shelf life. The reason for the limited shelf life is the fatty acids of the germ, which react {{from the moment they}} are exposed to oxygen. This occurs when grain is milled; the fatty acids oxidize and flour starts to become rancid.Depending on climate and grain quality, this process takes six to nine months. In the late 19th century, this process was too short for an industrial production and distribution cycle. As vitamins, micronutrients and amino acids were completely or relatively unknown in the late 19th century, removing the germ was an effective solution. Without the germ, flour cannot become rancid. <b>Degermed</b> flour became standard. Degermation started in densely populated areas and took approximately one generation to reach the countryside.Heat-processed flour is flour where the germ is first separated from the endosperm and bran, then processed with steam, dry heat or microwave and blended into flour again.|$|R

To explore how these plant-based foods can be better used in human nutrition, we have created the computational tool vProtein to identify optimal food complements to satisfy human protein needs. Methods: vProtein uses 1251 plant-based foods listed in the United States Department of Agriculture standard release 22 database to determine the quantity of each food or pair of foods required to satisfy human IAA needs {{as determined by the}} 2005 daily recommended intake. The quantity of food in a pair is found using a linear programming approach that minimizes total calories, total excess IAAs, or the total weight of the combination.

Free fatty acids (FFA), {{as well as those}} present in triglycerides (TGFA), diglycerides (DGFA), monoglycerides (MGFA), polar lipids (PLFA), and the total lipid extract (TFA) have been determinated by GLC. In all parts studied, the PLFA pattern is rather constant and, the rootlets excepted, so is their content in the tissues (% of dry matter). Observed changes in lipid content and composition are mainly due to the glyceride fractions. In the <b>degermed</b> seed, lipid is lost at a faster relative rate than non-fat dry matter.

Response surface methodology was used to analyse the effect of process variables (temperature and moisture) on hydration properties, evaluated by water solubility (S) and by amylographic retrogradation (R). Results show that precooked flours obtained by popping have a very high suspension consistency with low or intermediate S, while those obtained by extrusion have very high S but a much lower suspension consistency. The high S values for extruded samples are even higher than those for extruded waxy types of cereals. The effects of the variables on each response depend on each case. S increases as temperature (T) and moisture (M) increase in both processes, although in extrusion, a maximum value was observed at 200 ºC and about 15 % M. On the other hand, an inverse variable effect is observed for R; a minimum value is observed with extruded samples at about 14 % M and for the whole T range, while a typical saddle-shaped surface is obtained for popped samples, with maximum values found at about 14 % and 18 % M for the two extreme T values, the highest and lowest, respectively. Another interesting effect is that the S-R pair values corresponding to popped samples do not fit the correlation between S and R, normally found with extruded samples.

Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to compare four different diets for the grow-finish pig in regards to its behavior and postures. Pigs were observed over their grow-finish phase of production, which was comprised of six different dietary formulation phases. Four treatments were compared: distillers dried grains plus solubles (DDGS), dehulled <b>degermed</b> corn (DDC), corn germ meal (CGM), and a traditional corn based diet (CORN). All diets were isocaloric and formulated to NRC recommendations (NRC, 1998).

Analysis of variance on the data from Vienna and Mainz revealed significant differences of means not only between procedures ('preparations') but also on repeat testing. To compensate for the influence of variables such as test subjects, laboratory and day, the Vienna test model provides a method of standardization by testing a ST in parallel with the test procedure (P). Standardization of the results was obtained by pair-wise substraction, log RFPi-log RFSTi. Analysis of variance on the resulting values demonstrated that comparability of the results between laboratories and on repeat testing was achieved. The relative variation of the measurements within the laboratories ranged from 0. 9 to 4. 2 %. As assessed by power-analysis, a disinfection procedure will be detected as significantly (P = 0. 1) inferior to the standard processes in 95 of 100 experiments if it produces a mean log RF that is at least 0. 55 - 0. 65 log units smaller than that of the standard...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Many {{techniques}} {{are there for}} skin preparation before surgery, the commonest being initial scrub with antiseptic soap solution, followed by painting the prepared area with antiseptic paint solution. But <b>degerming</b> of the skin {{can be done with}} antiseptics us ed for less than one minute which is as effective as five minute scrub with germicidal soap solution followed by painting with antiseptics. AIMS AND OBJECTIVES : 1. To evaluate the efficacy of povidone iodine alone and antiseptic agent containing alcoholic chlorhexidine with povidone iodine in preoperative skin preparation by taking swab culture. 2. To compare the rate of postoperative wound infection in both the groups. METHODS: STUDY DESIGN: Comparative study conducted on 100 patients in two groups. STUDY SETTING: Sri Venkateswara Medical College Tirupathi SOURCE OF DATA: 100 Patients (50 in each Group) undergoing elective and emergency surgery admitted in the Department of General Surgery in S. V. R. R. Government General Hospital, Tirupati from 2013 to 2014. INCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Patients undergoing elective & emergency surgery in department of general surgery. 2. Patients with no focus of infection anywhere on the body. 3. Patients irrespective of their age and sex. 4. Patients neither immunocompromised nor on any long term steroids. 5. Patients undergoing mes h repair of hernia are also included. EXCLUSION CRITERIA: 1. Immuno compromised patients and patients on long term steroids. 2. Patients with septicemia. 3. Patients suffering from malignancies or undergoing chemotherapy or radiation therapy. 4. Contaminat ed surgeries in which viscus was opened were excluded from the study. 5. Patients with co - morbid medical conditions like diabetes, hypertension etc. METHOD OF COLLECTION OF DATA: In each case preoperatively, detailed history was taken and routine investiga tions like haemoglobin, total count, differential count, ESR, RBS and chest X - ray, ultrasound were done to rule out any co - morbid conditions, chronic infections or malignancy. Preoperative shaving of the parts was done at the same time on previous evening for all the patients and same antibiotic protocol was followed. The pre - operative skin preparation in each group is done with the respective antiseptic regimen. Group I: Three coats of aqueous povidone iodine IP 5...|$|R
40|$|Ready to Eat (RTE) {{snack foods}} are {{commonly}} manufactured using single and twin screw extruders and com grits as raw materials. Variations in product quality caused by grits from different hybrids and grain hardness {{have not been}} investigated. Furthermore, the relationship between rheological properties of the extrudate melt and the operating conditions in the extruder is not fully understood. Appropriate methods to determine com grain hardness to characterise com hybrids and the on-line viscosity of the extrudate melts {{have not yet been}} developed. These methods could provide sound and appropriate techniques to investigate the areas of milling and extrusion of com based food products. In this study, milling characteristics of 38 com hybrids from the 92 - 93 season and 12 com hybrids from the 94 - 95 season produced in New Zealand were studied. A modified Stenvert Hardness Test (SHT) using new parameters including milling energy and milling resistance time was developed. It was found that the modified SHT was simple and easy to use with low variability. The SHT milling energy can be used as an effective hardness index. It increased with grain bulk density and the ratio of hard to soft endosperm. All measured properties were highly dependent on the moisture content. For the same hybrid, SHT hardness increased and the grain bulk density decreased when the moisture content of the com grains increased. A roller-milling test was also developed to study the dry milling characteristics of these com hybrids. During milling, the breaking force measured in the roller-milling test increased with grain hardness. Analysis of particle size distributions in the ground samples after the modified Stenvert Hardness tests and the roller-milling tests showed that grit recovery rate increased with the grain hardness. Grits produced from hybrids harvested in the 92 - 93 and the 94 - 95 seasons, along with other grits and starches commercially manufactured in New Zealand, were used for the extrusion experiments. A new Slit-Die-Viscometer (SDV) was developed to measure the viscosity of extrudate melts on-line. Unlike many other viscometers used on-line, the operation of the new SDV did not interfere with the operating conditions of the extruder. The rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation were affected by the operating conditions of the extruder and the characteristics of the raw materials: It was found that the melt viscosity decreased as moisture content increased. The apparent viscosity had a maximum value at barrel temperature of about 130 DC, changed very little when screw speed increased at constant feed, and decreased slightly when the feed increased at constant screw speed. The grits were less gelatinised at high moisture content. The degree of starch gelatinisation increased slightly with screw speed and linearly with barrel temperature between 90 DC and 130 DC. At barrel temperatures higher than 130 DC, the extrudate was almost fully gelatinised. Melts produced with starch of high amylopectin content had an overall lower viscosity with less shear thinning and a higher degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with starch of high amylose content. Grit size affected the rheological properties and the degree of starch gelatinisation. Melts produced from medium and coarse grits had a lower viscosity and a lower degree of starch gelatinisation than that produced with fine grits. The effect of different hybrids of the same season on the rheological properties of the melt was negligible. However, the rheological properties were affected by the methods used to produce the grits. Grits from <b>degermed</b> grains had less oil and produced melts with lower viscosity and less shear thinning than grits from whole grains (higher oil content) ...|$|R
