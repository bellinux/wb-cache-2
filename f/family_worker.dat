Fifty years ago, unpaid <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> contributed significantly to farm work while paid workers were not as common. Now, the share of paid workers is converging towards that of self-employed farmers while unpaid <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> have basically disappeared. The increase in paid work can also be observed at the individual level. Almost half of all farmers reported another professional activity, be it paid off-farm work or a nonagricultural business. Changes affecting farming can also be observed in the income composition of farming families. Net farm income now accounts for roughly one-fourth of the family's total income.

50|$|The Journal of Family Strengths (JFS), {{formerly}} the Family Preservation Journal, is an open-access, peer-reviewed online journal edited by the Children At Risk Institute {{in partnership with}} the Center for Family Strengths at the University of Houston-Downtown, and published by the Houston Academy of Medicine-Texas Medical Center Library. The Journal’s goal is to facilitate <b>family,</b> <b>worker,</b> supervisor, educator and agency interchange, to promote research and evaluation, and to disseminate information for best practices that support family centered practice. These services may include: child welfare, mental health (wraparound), substance abuse, juvenile justice, developmentally challenged, schools, health care, elders, and other social welfare services. The Journal provides a forum for practitioners, program designers, administrators, researchers, and educators to present and critically review programs, policies, practice methods, and research findings from a family strengths perspective. The Journal is intended to positively impact the form and type of services provided to families. Research and case studies from those receiving and delivering services is encouraged.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the main determinants of self-employment in Turkey. For this aim, we utilized from {{the definition of}} self-employment in TURKSTAT’s Household Labor Force Surveys (HLFS), where self-employment covers three groups of individuals, namely, employer, own-account worker and unpaid-family workers. The data set is obtained from the raw data of Household Labor Force Surveys of 2006 - 2007 and 2008. In order to analyze the data, the multinomial-logit model is used and estimated by maximum likelihood estimation method. Main findings of this analysis are as the following. We find that living in the urban areas {{increases the likelihood of}} being employer, but decreases the likelihood of being own-account worker as well as unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> as compared to the base category of wage-employed individuals. Also, being female declines the likelihood of being in the self-employment types. Further, being married increases the probability of being employer and own-account worker, while it declines the probability of being unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker.</b> In addition, being head of household increases the likelihood of being employer, but it declines the likelihood of being own-account worker and unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> as compared to the base group. Furthermore, increases in age continuously increase the probability of being employer, while there is a U-shaped relation between age and being unpaid <b>family</b> <b>worker,</b> compared to the base group of wage-employed. As compared to non-graduates the probability of being employer is lower for vocational high school and university graduates, while the same probability is higher for B. Darıcı & H. M.

30|$|As {{we would}} expect, the median monthly income is highest for {{government}} workers, at about 25, 000 Taka. Interestingly, self-employed workers report the next highest median monthly income (i.e., net profits), {{with those who}} have non-family employees reporting about 20, 000 Taka, {{and those who do not}} reporting about 15, 000 Taka. Private employees report a median monthly income of 9500 Taka, while casual and <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> report only 7500 Taka. We also show estimated hourly earnings, which are calculated by dividing monthly earnings by estimated number of hours worked in a month. The ranking of income estimates remains largely stable, although <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> have a higher median hourly income than casual workers.|$|R
3000|$|Overall, these {{findings}} suggest that private wage employment may not always be preferable to self-employment. This is particularly true for self-employed businesses that look more like entrepreneurial startups (i.e., hire non-family members) and less like household businesses. In keeping with {{these findings}}, self-employed workers who employ non-family members, and who transition to other types of work, exhibit large drops in monthly income, regardless of what activities they transition into. We similarly see a wage drop among those who are <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> in household businesses, when they transition to private wage employment; however, it is possible that self-employed and <b>family</b> <b>workers</b> are trading off income against other benefits of wage employment, such as job stability. 10 [...]...|$|R
