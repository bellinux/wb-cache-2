50|$|The Suguti {{property}} is {{located within the}} prospective greenstone belt of the Mara-Musoma goldfield. The outcropping geology comprises an area of mafic to intermediate volcanics that form a large easterly trending range of hills in the northern portion of the property. This range is dominated by a prominent and strongly magnetic BIF extending for at least 8 km across the property. Smaller BIF units occur elsewhere within the volcanic succession and these are typically 5 to 10m wide representing thin interflow sediments to the volcanics. The greenstones are most likely part of the Upper Nyanzian System.The south west corner of the project is covered by mbugu clays which have filled a topographic depression formed by the regionally significant northwest-trending Suguti shear. The primary shear extends in excess of 50 km and has displacements of several kilometres interpreted from the geology {{either side of the}} fault contact. The shear is also readily identified from the aerial magnetic data as zones of <b>demagnetisation.</b> A secondary cross cutting northeast trending fault terminates the eastern end of the prominent BIF horizon.

It can be prevented if the magnet thickness is sufficient. However local irreversible <b>demagnetisation</b> can occur even if the magnet thickness is sufficient. The local irreversible <b>demagnetisation</b> is varied according to the magnetic path. To analyse the cause of local irreversible <b>demagnetisation,</b> the authors introduced an interior PMSM (IPMSM), consisting of a V-shaped magnet and concentrated winding, and performed a parameter analysis of the magnetic field based on the barrier width and magnet position considerably related to the magnetic path using the finite-element method. On the basis of the results, the authors developed a model avoiding local irreversible <b>demagnetisation.</b> A maximum load test was performed after a thermal saturation test to confirm whether irreversible <b>demagnetisation</b> of the manufactured models occurred.

40|$|This paper proposes and investigates an {{analytical}} method {{for assessing the}} risk of potential, irreversible <b>demagnetisation</b> in the PMs of electrical machines, equipped with n-stages, Halbach arrays. The higher risk of <b>demagnetisation,</b> synonymous with Halbach arrays imposes that the method be both load and temperature dependant. In fact, the proposed method studies the magnetic field distribution in the air-gap and PM region, for various operating temperatures and expresses these fields as analytical expressions for the no-load and peak load conditions. The model can cater for Halbach arrays with up to n stages, thus making it a versatile tool that can be utilised for various Halbach configurations. Finite element analysis is used to validate the method. The analytical tool is then used for the design and analysis of a high torque density, outer rotor, traction motor. The motor is for an aerospace application and its operating duty cycle imposes very high, short time, peak load conditions at elevated temperatures, posing an elevated risk of irreversible, PM <b>demagnetisation.</b> The model is used to investigate various Halbach configurations for this application, {{in order to reduce}} the <b>demagnetisation</b> risk and also improve the general performance of the machine. The analytical method thus provides a computationally efficient tool that can be used to predict and prevent <b>demagnetisation</b> in Halbach-equipped, electrical machines operating in harsh environments such as the aerospace sector...|$|E

Ultrafast <b>demagnetisation</b> has previously been observed via the generation of Terahertz emissions (among other methods) using amplified lasers, and by magneto-optical methods using non-amplified lasers. Using a fast (short pulse length), low power laser, with lower pulse energies, but comparable peak pulse power density, models of ultrafast <b>demagnetisation</b> were compared. The models compared were the Two Temperature model proposed by Vaterlaus et al. [1], the Three Temperature Model by Beaurepaire et al. [2], the Non- Thermal-Electron model by Ju et al.

A quasi-null result of THz spectral power density 3 ̆c 10 − 22 W · THz− 1, from Nickel samples, was inconsistent with predictions of the Two Temperature Model. More accurate measurements of Terahertz emission were not possible due to cumulative noise effects from the high pulse repetition frequency, and low pulse energy used. In addition, theoretical investigations into the Microscopic Three Temperature Model were undertaken. These predicted that the peak Terahertz emission frequency is inversely proportional to the ultrafast pulse length. It was also predicted that (for the laser modelled) peak power output is achieved by initiating <b>demagnetisation</b> from ≈ 80...|$|E
40|$|Ways to utilise ferrite {{permanent}} magnets (PMs), {{in a better}} way has been in focus {{the last couple of years}} since the use of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) PMs has been debated. While ferrite PMs offer a low-cost alternative to rare- earth PMs, it is a trade-off for lower energy density. Depending on the type of PM and if the PMs are surface mounted or buried, the risk of <b>demagnetisation</b> during a fault condition can vary significantly between machines. In this study, the demagnetisation risk of two electrically similar generators with identical stators has been studied during several short- circuit faults at different temperatures. The study is simulation-based, and the results show that the generator with the ferrite rotor will suffer from a small but not significant amount of <b>demagnetisation</b> in the worst, three-phase-neutral, short-circuit case at a temperature of 5 °C, whereas the NdFeB PMs will suffer from partial <b>demagnetisation</b> if a fault occurs at 120 °C.

Second, the stator current in the static coordinate is set as the state variable, an observer is designed based on a sliding-mode variable structure, and an equation for active flux linkage is established for dynamic estimation based on the equivalent control principle of sliding-mode variable structure. Finally, the active flux linkage for the next moment is predicted according to the operating conditions of the motor and the observed values of the current active flux linkage. The deadbeat control strategy is applied to eliminate errors in the active flux linkage and realise the objective of fault-tolerant control.

A total of 813 {{samples were collected}} that span {{from the top of}} the section down to the base at 1138. 54 metres below sea floor (mbsf). Samples were collected every one or two metres down the core, with paired (pilot) samples being collected about every ten to twenty metres to allow us to assess the <b>demagnetisation</b> behaviour of the samples using either alternating field (AF) or thermal <b>demagnetisation.</b> With the exception of only a few intervals, AF <b>demagnetisation</b> was observed to resolve a characteristic remanent magnetisation (ChRM) as well or better than thermal <b>demagnetisation.</b> Thermal <b>demagnetisation</b> was particularly ineffective in many intervals owing to thermal alteration that was common above 500 °C and was evident in some samples even at low temperatures. Above Lithostratigraphic Unit (LSU) 8 (436. 18 mbsf), where lithologies are generally more coarse grained than lower in the section, resolving a ChRM is difficult and recent overprints or a drilling overprint are a concern. Within LSU 8 and below, most samples have a ChRM that can be resolved. The ChRM is most likely an original depositional magnetisation throughout most of this lower section, although orthogonal <b>demagnetisation</b> diagrams contain evidence that normal polarity overprinting affects some intervals. Based on 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates and diatom datums, the magnetozones identified from the base of the hole up to ~ 266 mbsf are consistent with spanning from either Chron C 6 n (18. 748 - 19. 772 Ma) or C 6 An. 1 n (20. 040 - 20. 213 Ma) up through Chron C 5 Br (15. 160 - 15. 974 Ma). Above this, intervals of constant polarity are isolated within longer stratigraphic intervals of uncertain polarity, making their correlation with the geomagnetic polarity timescale (GPTS) speculative and highly dependent on ages obtained from other dating methods. One exception is a reversed-to-normal polarity transition that occurs at ~ 31 mbsf and is interpreted to most likely be the Brunhes/Matuyama boundary. The spacing of polarity reversals below 266 mbsf and their correlation with the GPTS indicates that this part of the stratigraphic section was deposited between 15 to 20 Ma at a mean sedimentation rate of about 18 centimetres (cm) / thousand year (k. y.) ...|$|E
40|$|We {{demonstrate}} significant cooling {{of electrons}} in a nanostructure below 10 mK by <b>demagnetisation</b> of thin-film copper on a silicon chip. Our approach overcomes the typical bottleneck of weak electron-phonon scattering by coupling the electrons {{directly to a}} bath of refrigerated nuclei, rather than cooling via phonons in the host lattice. Consequently, weak electron-phonon scattering becomes an advantage. It allows the electrons to be cooled for an experimentally useful {{period of time to}} temperatures colder than the dilution refrigerator platform, the incoming electrical connections, and the host lattice. There are efforts worldwide to reach sub-millikelvin electron temperatures in nanostructures to study coherent electronic phenomena and improve the operation of nanoelectronic devices. On-chip magnetic cooling is a promising approach to meet this challenge. The method can be used to reach low, local electron temperatures in other nanostructures, obviating the need to adapt traditional, large <b>demagnetisation</b> stages. We demonstrate the technique by applying it to a nanoelectronic primary thermometer that measures its internal electron temperature. Using an optimised <b>demagnetisation</b> process, we demonstrate cooling of the on-chip electrons from 9 mK to below 5 mK for over 1000 seconds. Comment: 9 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{have studied}} {{experimentally}} the states formed in artificial square ice nanomagnet systems following <b>demagnetisation</b> in a rotating in-plane {{applied magnetic field}} that reduces to zero {{in a manner that}} is linear in time. The final states are found to be controlled via the system&# 39;s lattice constant, which determines the strength of the magnetostatic interactions between the elements, as well as the field ramping rate. We understand these effects as a requirement that the system undergoes a sufficiently large number of active rotations within the critical field window in which elements may be reversed, such that the interactions are allowed to locally exert their influence if the ground state is to be approached. On the other hand, if quenched disorder is too strong when compared to the interaction strength, any close approach to the ground state is impossible. These results show that it is not necessary for there to be any ac component to the field amplitude that is applied to the system during <b>demagnetisation,</b> which is the method almost exclusively employed in field protocols reported to date. Furthermore, by optimising the parameters of our linear <b>demagnetisation</b> protocol, the largest field-generated ground state domains yet reported are found...|$|E

40|$|A fully {{automatic}} {{system has been}} designed for the accurate measurement of the DC magnetic properties of soft and hard ferromagnetic materials utilising discrete calibrated instruments {{in order to provide}} a traceable calibration route separate from the transfer of standard magnetic test samples. Custom written software is used to operate the system in one of three modes, constant dH/dt, variable dH/dt and a second quadrant <b>demagnetisation</b> curve mode. The first two of these modes are utilised for soft magnetic materials with the second mode varying dH/dt in order to keep dB/dt relatively constant. Both modes use cycle times of between 60 and 300 s and may utilise a variety of test configurations including a bar permeameter, electromagnet, ring samples or Epstein frame. The minimum cycle time and the most appropriate mode is dependent on the particular sample and the effect of this on materials with a large dB/dH is significant. Measurements on soft materials include major BH loop, minor BH loops, first-order reversal curves, remanence, coercivity, normal magnetisation curve, peak permeability and loop area. The third mode is used with an electromagnet to measure the <b>demagnetisation</b> curve of hard magnetic materials up to a maximum <b>demagnetisation</b> field of 1. 6 MA/m.

30|$|A new {{instrument}} to continuously determine the remanent magnetisation of standard paleomagnetic (inchsized) rock samples during {{heating and cooling}} (continuous thermal <b>demagnetisation)</b> was developed. The design as an off-axis spinner magnetometer (i.e. the samples rotate on a circular path in a radial distance to the spinning axis) allows the simultaneous measurement of several samples and offers a way to determine the full vector of magnetisation. Six fluxgate sensors are used to record three gradients of the magnetic fields caused by the samples and the vector of remanence is determined by regression analysis of the gradient signals. The sensitivity of the instrument is 2 · 10 − 7 Am 2.

40|$|AbstractThe {{design and}} {{performance}} of a fast thermal response miniature (24 mm outer diameter by 30 mm long) Chromium Potassium Alum (CPA) salt pill is described. The need for a fast thermal response {{has been driven by}} the development of a continuously operating millikelvin cryocooler (mKCC) which uses 2 T superconducting magnets that can be ramped to full field in 30 s. The consequence of magnetising and demagnetising the CPA pill {{in such a short time}} is that thermal boundary resistance and eddy current heating have a significant impact on the performance of the pill, which was investigated in detail using modelling. The complete design of a prototype CPA pill is described in this paper, including the methods used to minimise thermal boundary resistance and eddy current heating as well as the manufacturing and assembly processes. The performance of the prototype CPA pill operated from a 3. 6 K bath is presented, demonstrating that a complete CPA cycle (magnetising, cooling to bath and demagnetising) can be accomplished in under 2. 5 min, with magnetisation and <b>demagnetisation</b> taking just 30 s each. The cold finger base temperature of the prototype varies with <b>demagnetisation</b> speed as a consequence of eddy current heating; for a 30 s <b>demagnetisation,</b> a base temperature of 161 mK is obtained, whilst for a 5 min <b>demagnetisation,</b> a base temperature of 149 mK was measured (both from a 3. 6 K and 2 T starting position). The measured hold times of the CPA pill at 200 mK, 300 mK, and 1 K are given, proving that the hold time far exceeds the recycle time and demonstrating the potential for continuous operation when two ADRs are used in a tandem configuration. The ease and speed at which the CPA pill temperature can be changed and controlled when stepping between operating temperatures in the range of 200 mK to 4 K using a servo control program is also shown, once again highlighting the excellent thermal response of the pill. All of the test results are in good agreement with the modelling used to design the CPA pill, giving good confidence in our ability to understand and estimate the effects of eddy current heating and thermal boundary resistance. To conclude, the design for the CPA pill to be used in the mKCC (which is heavily based on the design of the prototype) is presented...|$|E
