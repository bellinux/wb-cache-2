The data were acquired in 2006 in Gainesville, Florida. The largest pulses in the train can exceed in magnitude the following first return-stroke pulse. The arithmetic mean pulse duration and interpulse interval for pulse trains in negative cloud-to-ground discharges are 4. 8 and 65 µs, respectively. The arithmetic mean pulse duration and interpulse interval for pulse trains in attempted cloud-to-ground leaders are 17 and 73 µs, respectively.

40|$|The authors use {{the runaway}} air {{breakdown}} model of upward discharges to calculate optical, radio, and X-ray radiation generated by red sprites. Red sprites are high altitude (up to 90 km) lightning discharges. Aircraft based observations show that sprites are predominantly red in color at altitudes above {approximately} 55 km with faint blue tendrils, which extend downward to {{an altitude of}} 40 km; the duration of a single sprite is less than 17 ms, their maximum brightness is about 600 kR, and estimated total optical energy is about 1 [...] 5 kJ per event. The ground based observations show similar results, and provide some additional information on spatial and temporal structure of sprites, and on sprite locations. One difference between aircraft and ground-based observations is that blue tendrils are rarely observed from the ground.

40|$|Red Sprites and Blue Jets are two {{different}} types of recently discovered optical flashes ob- served above large thunderstorm systems. Sprites are luminous glows occurring at altitudes typically ranging from approximately 50 to 90 km. In video they exhibit a red color at their top which gradually changes to blue at lower altitudes. Sprites may occur singly or in clusters of two or more. The lateral extent of "unit" sprites is typically 5 - 10 km and they endure for several milliseconds. Jets are upward moving (approximately 100 km/s) highly collimated beams of luminosity, emanating from the tops of thunderclouds, extending up to approximately 50 km altitude and exhibiting a primarily blue color. We propose that sprites result from large electric field transients capable of causing electron heating, breakdown ionization and excitation of optical emissions at mesospheric altitudes following the removal of thundercloud charge by a cloud-to-ground discharge. Depending on the history of charge accumulation and removal, and the distribution of ambient atmospheric conductivity, the breakdown region may have the shape of vertically oriented ionization column(s). Results of a two-dimensional and self consistent quasi-electrostatic (QE) model indicate that most of the observed features of sprites can be explained in terms of the formation and self-driven propagation of streamer type channels of breakdown ionization. Comparison of the optical emission intensities of the 1 st and 2 nd positive bands of N 2, Meinel and 1 st negative bands of N 2 (+) and the 1 st negative band of O 2 (+) demonstrates that the 1 st positive band of N 2 is the dominant optical emission in the altitude range approximately 50 - 90 km, which accounts for the observed red color of sprites. Optical emissions of the 1 st and 2 nd positive bands of N 2 occur in carrot-like vertical structures with typical transverse dimension approximately 5 - 10 km which can span an altitude range from approximately 80 km to well below approximately 50 km.

40|$|Data {{assimilation}} (DA) is {{a method}} that optimally combines imperfect models and uncertain observations to correct model states using new information acquired from the incoming observations. In recent years, DA has been extensively used for improving the uncertainty of hydrologic prediction, {{largely due to the}} emergence of advanced remote sensing tools for observations of soil moisture, river discharge and precipitation. Several DA methods have been explored in hydrology; however the choice and the effectiveness of a specific DA method may vary depending on the model and the observation. The goal of this dissertation study was reducing streamflow forecast uncertainty, and was carried out in three parts. First, the effectiveness of four different DA methods (ensemble Kalman filter (EnKF), particle filter (PF), Maximum Likelihood Ensemble Filter (MLEF) and variational method (VAR)) for improving streamflow forecasting were evaluated. In-situ discharge was assimilated into The United States National Weather Service (NWS) river forecasting model (Sacramento Soil Moisture Accounting model (SAC-SMA)) for Greens Bayou basin (with area of 178 km 2), in eastern Texas. The results indicate that all the four DA methods enhanced the short lead time forecast when compared to the model without the data assimilation; however the performances of each method vary with flow magnitude and longer lead time forecasts. Overall, the PF and MLEF performed superior to other DA algorithms across all flow regimes. In the second part of this thesis, the value of satellite-based soil moisture retrievals for enhancing river discharge was assessed. Surface and root zone satellite-based soil moisture retrievals from AMSR-E (passive microwave) and ASCAT (active microwave) sensors were separately assimilated into the SAC-SMA model in Greens bayou using ensemble Kalman filter. Two different data assimilation experiments were carried out over a period of four years (2007 to 2010) : updating the soil moisture state of the SAC-SMA model and combined correcting of soil moisture and total channel inflow (TCI) of the model. It was found that the remotely-sensed soil moisture assimilation reduced the discharge RMSE compared to the open loop for both assimilation schemes, and there was no appreciable difference between surface and root zone soil moisture results, as well as between the AMSR-E and ASCAT results. Furthermore, the dual correcting of soil moisture and TCI produced lower river discharge RMSE. In the third part, the utility of passive microwave-based river width estimates for river discharge nowcasting and forecasting were assessed for two major rivers, the Ganges and Brahmaputra, in south Asia. Multiple upstream satellite observations of river and flood plains were used to track downstream flood wave propagation, and using a cross-validation regression model, the downstream river discharge was forecasted for lead times up to 15 days. The results showed that satellite derived flow signals were able to detect the propagation of a river flow wave along both river channels. And the approach also provided better discharge forecasts at downstream location compared to a purely persistence forecast, especially for high flows when the water spills out of the river bank. Overall, it was concluded that satellitebased flow estimates are a useful source of dynamical surface water information in regions where {{there is a lack of}} <b>ground</b> <b>discharge</b> data...|$|E
40|$|Being one of {{the most}} {{spectacular}} events in nature, lightning is basically a transient high current electric discharge in the atmosphere, which extends up to kilometres. Cloud to <b>ground</b> <b>discharge</b> is the most hazardous one as far as ground based structures are considered. Among the different phases of a lightning flash, return stroke is considered to be the most energetic phase and is basically responsible for most of the damages. Hence, much emphasis has been given to return stroke modeling. A more realistic modeling of return stroke is very essential to accurately study the interaction of return stroke with the structures on ground. As return stroke is dominated by electromagnetic phenomenon, an electromagnetic model will be the most suitable one. It does not call for any assumption on the mode of wave propagation, as well as, electromagnetic coupling between the different channel portions. There are mainly two approaches adopted for electromagnetic models i. e. frequency domain and time domain approach. Time domain approach is more reliable as it can handle, in principle, the nonlinear processes in the lightning channel. It is also free of numerical frequency domain to time domain inversion problem, which are found to be quite severe. However, most of the previous works on time domain electromagnetic models suffered from following two serious limitations - (i) the initial charge on the channel, which forms the true excitation for the problem, is not considered and (ii) instead of the non-linearly rising conductivity of the channel, a constant resistance is employed. For a realistic simulation of the interaction between the channel and any intercepting system, a time domain model with the above two major aspects being fully represented is very essential. In an earlier work, all these aspects have been fully considered but a domain based numerical modelling was employed. Consequently, it was difficult to consider the down conductor and further the number of unknowns was considerably large. In view of this, the present work is taken up and its scope is defined as to develop a boundary based numerical time domain electromagnetic model in which the initial charge on the channel and the non-linearly evolving channel conductance are fully considered. For the electrical engineering applications, electromagnetic aspects of the lightning phenomena {{is more important than the}} other associated physical processes and hence, importance is given only to the electromagnetic aspects. In other words, the light emission, thunder, chemical reactions at the channel etc. are not considered. Also, for most of the electrical engineering applications, the critical portion of current would be the region up to and around the peak and hence, modeling for this regime will be given prime importance. Owing to the complexity of the problem, some simplifying assumptions would be very essential. The literature indicates that these assumptions do not affect the adequate representation of the phenomena. Lightning channel is considered to be vertically straight without any branches. Earth is considered to be perfectly conducting. Explicit reference to dynamically varying channel radius, temperature and the air density is not made. However, it is assumed that the arc equation employed to describe the temporal changes in conductivity would adequately take care of these parameters. Lightning channel is represented by a highly conducting small core, which is surrounded by a weakly conducting corona sheath. The initial charge on the channel is deduced by solving for electrostatic field, with leader portion set to possess an axial gradient of 60 V/cm and the streamer portion to 5 – 10 kV/cm. The radius of the corona sheath is set iteratively by enforcing a gradient of 24 kV/cm up to its radial boundary. As analytical solution for the problem is impractical, suitable numerical solution is sought. Since the spatial extension of this time marching problem is virtually unbound and that the significant conduction is rather solely confined to an extremely small cross section of the channel core, a boundary-based method is selected. Amongst the numerical methods, the present work employs the moment method for the solution of the fields associated with the return strokes. A numerical solution of the Electric Field Integral Equation (EFIE) for thin structures has been developed in the literature. The same approach has been employed in the present work, however, with suitable modifications to suit the lightning problem. The code was written in MATLAB and integrations involved in the EFIE were solved using MATLAB symbolic computation. Before introducing the channel dynamic conductance and the initial charge on the channel, the code developed is validated by comparing the results for a center fed dipole antenna with that given in the literature. Also, NEC (Numeric Electromagnetic Code) simulations for various cases of monopole and dipole antenna were performed. The results from the code developed are shown to have good matching with that obtained from NEC based time domain results. In an earlier work, the dynamic conductance of the return stroke channel core, which is a high current electric arc, was represented by a first order arc equation. The same approach is employed in the present work also. Similarly, the transition from streamer to leader was modeled by Braginskii’s spark law and the same has been considered in the present work. A value of 10 - 5 S/m was used for minimum value of streamer conductance. For numerical stability, upper (Gmax = 3 S/m) and lower bounds (Gmin = 0. 0083 S/m) for the channel conductance are forced. Preliminary simulations were run with and without dynamic channel conductance. The initial charge distribution along the channel formed the excitation. Results clearly show that without the dynamically varying channel conductance, no streamer to leader transition and hence, no return stroke evolution can occur. In other words, the non-linearly evolving channel conductance is mainly responsible for the evolution of the return stroke. In order to consider the charge neutralization by the return stroke, the charge deposited by it is diffused into the corona sheath. A fixed value of the corona sheath conductance is employed and the diffusion process is modeled by an equation derived from the continuity equation. To study the effect of corona sheath, simulations were run with and without corona. From the simulation results it was observed that the corona sheath causes increase in peak value of the stroke current, as well as, time to front and a decrease in the velocity of propagation. For the validation of the model, the basic characteristics of the return stroke current like the current wave shape, temporal variation of stroke current at different heights, velocity of propagation and the vertical electric fields at various radial distances were compared with available field/experimental data. A good agreement was seen and based on this, it is concluded that the present work has successfully developed a boundary based time domain numerical model for the lightning return stroke. Natural lightning being a stochastic process, the values of the parameters associated with it would differ in every event. On other hand, any deterministic model like the one developed in the present work predicts a fixed pattern of the simulated quantities. Therefore, it was felt that some of the model parameters must be permitted to vary so that a range of results could be obtained rather than a single pattern of results. Incidentally, the model parameters like arc time constant, settling value of arc conductivity/gradient, bounds for channel conductivity, streamer gradient, radius of the core etc. are not precisely known for the natural lightning environment. Further, some of them are known to vary within an event. Considering these and that simplicity is very important in already complex model, the above-mentioned parameters are taken as tunable parameters (of course to be varied within the prescribed range) for deducing the return stroke currents with some desired characteristics. A study on the influence of these parameters is made and suggestions are provided. Simulations for the nominal range of stroke currents are made and results are presented. These simulations clearly show the role of cloud potential, which in turn dictates the length of final bridging streamer, on the return stroke currents. The spatio-temporal variation of the current, charge deposited by the return stroke and the channel conductivity are presented which, reveal the dynamic processes leading to the evolution of return stroke current. Subsequently, simulations for two cases of stroke to elevated strike object are attempted. The upward leader was modeled quite similar to the descending one. Many interesting findings are made. In summary, the present work has successfully developed a boundary-based time domain numerical electromagnetic model for the lightning return stroke, wherein, the initial charge deposited on the channel and the non-linearly rising channel conductance have been appropriately considered. Simulation using the model clearly depicts the dynamic evolution of the return stroke. The characteristics of the simulated return strokes are in good agreement with the field data. Some of the parameters of the model are suggested as tunable parameters, which permit simulation of strokes with different characteristics...|$|E
40|$|Eighteen {{years ago}} {{researchers}} accidentally discovered spectacular flashes occurring {{high up in}} the atmosphere above intense thunderstorms, which have later become known as sprites. Since, a category of upper atmospheric optical phenomena has been established, including elves, blue jets, and halos, in addition to sprites, collectively termed as transient luminous events (TLEs). Their highly non-linear nature and short lifetimes, from less than 1 ms to about 250 ms, constitute an impediment to their study. Although their discovery opened a new field of research that has advanced our physical understanding of TLEs, important questions still remain unanswered. In particular, there is need to improve our knowledge on how the mechanisms responsible for TLEs affect the medium hosting them, that is, the upper atmosphere and lower ionosphere. The aim of this thesis is to contribute new knowledge on the physics of TLEs and the electrical coupling processes between the troposphere, where lightning occurs, and the upper atmosphere where the TLEs appear. The approach followed here is mostly experimental, based on the reception and analysis of electromagnetic signals from powerful very low frequency (VLF, 3 − 30 kHz) transmitters around the globe. Their propagation in the Earth-ionosphere waveguide can be affected by perturbations in ionospheric conductivity which might also be caused directly by the electrical coupling of the troposphere and the lower ionosphere during TLE occurrences. High resolution VLF recordings made with state-of-the art receivers in Crete and France simultaneously with TLE and lightning detection observations in France, were analysed to study the effects of lightning-induced electric fields on the lower ionosphere. These investigations led to a number of new findings which are reported in the present thesis. A virtually one-to-one relationship between sprites and early VLF events was established. This constitutes evidence of electron density enhancements in the D region during sprites, corroborating theoretical predictions of lightning-induced air breakdown and ionisation production in the upper atmosphere. The relation between sprites and their causative positive cloud-to-ground (+CG) discharges was examined and revealed a 30 % occurrence of long-delayed sprites lagging a preceding discharge by 30 to 220 ms. This time lag is much larger than in previous reports, suggesting that long-lasting continuing currents {{play a key role in}} the build-up of sprite-causative, strong quasielectrostatic (QE) fields in the upper atmosphere/lower ionosphere. The role of intracloud lightning in the sprite generation process was studied further by using broadband VLF recordings in addition to lightning detection data of intracould discharges. It was found that intracloud lightning does indeed play a role, apparently by influencing the charge redistribution and thus shaping the intensity and duration of the mesospheric QE fields that produce sprites. In particular, the presence of intracloud discharges was found to be decisive in sprite morphology, leading to the appearance of carrot rather than column type sprites, possibly because they cause the impacting QE fields in the upper atmosphere to exceed the breakdown threshold for longer times and larger areas in the former cases than the latter. A D-region model, accounting for reactions between four types of charged particles and involving various electron loss mechanisms, was solved numerically to compute relaxation times for electron density enhancements produced by the action on the ionosphere of lightning-induced QE fields. Model results for different parameters were compared with early VLF event recoveries to infer estimates of sprite-related ionisation increases and the altitudes at which they occur. The model accounted for the observed recovery times from about 20 to more than 250 s, if electron density increases of 102 to 104 times the ambient values were taken to occur in the altitude range from 75 to 85 km. This endorsed the notion of VLF scattering from relatively large diffuse regions of electron ionisation enhancements located right below the night-time VLF reflection heights, in line also with existing simulations and observations of sprite halos. Studies of sprite-related early VLF perturbations lead to the discovery of a new category of VLF events, termed early/slow, characterised by long onset durations up to 2. 5 s in contrast to the well-known early/fast events reaching their maximum amplitude in less than 50 ms. A new mechanism was proposed to explain the slow growth of these events, postulating a process of gradual secondary ionisation build-up, caused by the effects on sprite-produced electrons of electromagnetic pulses (EMPs) radiated upwards by intracloud lightning channels. This was substantiated by the identification of burst-like VLF sferic activity in conjunction with intracloud discharges occurring in the sprite-producing storms, accompanying the early/slow event amplitude growth. An examination of elve observations, made by ground-based and satellite-borne imagers, along with simultaneous VLF recordings, led to the identification of elve-related early VLF perturbations for the first time. This is long-awaited experimental evidence in favour of ionisation produced in the upper D region by lightning-induced EMPs that also produce elves, which came in support of existing theories and simulation models. Using a chain of high-resolution pulsation magnetometers, the ultra low frequency (ULF, f< 10 Hz) response to sprite-producing lightning discharges was studied statistically. ULF signatures of sprite-producing and non sprite-related +CG discharges were compared. No signature was found unique to sprite-causative +CG discharges, in contrast with previous claims based on event studies. Finally, an existing numerical model was upgraded to be capable of simulating VLF scattering from a group of vertical plasma structures corresponding to sprite bodies. Under the action of an incident VLF wave, the scattering system was treated as an assembly of conducting columns divided into sequential radiating segments (dipoles). A novel feature was the inclusion of electromagnetic interaction between the radiating elements and realistic Earth-ionosphere waveguide propagation effects, which enables the simulation of a self-consistent scattering radiation pattern. First tests indicate that this model could be easily adapted to simulate early VLF perturbations at a receiver location.

Η παρούσα μελέτη οδήγησε σε μία σειρά νέων αποτελεσμάτων τα οποία και τεκμηριώνονται με λεπτομέρεια στην διατριβή, ενώ αποτέλεσαν τη βάση σειράς δημοσιεύσεων. Τα αποτελέσματα αυτά, συνοψίζονται εδώ ως εξής: 1) Βρέθηκε ότι τα sprites συνοδεύονται με μια παλμική διαταραχή στο πλάτος του VLF σήματος η οποία συνεπάγεται ότι η δράση των ηλεκτροστατικών παλμών που δημιουργούν το οπτικό φαινόμενο (με την διέγερση / αποδιέγερση των μορίων του αζώτου) παράγουν επίσης και ικανό ιονισμό στην κατώτερη ιονόσφαιρα ο οποίος ευθύνεται για την προς τα εμπρός κατευθυντική σκέδαση των κυμάτων VLF. 2) Βρέθηκε ότι υπάρχει μια σημαντική υποκατηγορία των sprites στην οποία το οπτικό φαινόμενο, αλλά και η παλμική διαταραχή που αποτυπώνεται στο VLF σήμα, καθυστερεί να εμφανισθεί ως προς την προκαλούσα αυτό θετική κεραυνική εκκένωση νέφους-εδάφους (positive cloud to <b>ground</b> <b>discharge,</b> +CG). Αυτό φαίνεται να υπαγορεύει ένα σημαντικό ρόλο, στον μηχανισμό δημιουργίας sprites, των «συνεχών ρευμάτων» (continuing currents) νέφους-εδάφους και νέφους-νέφους που ακολουθούν τις κεραυνικές εκκενώσεις. 3) Διαμέσου φασματικής ανάλυσης του κεραυνικού ΗΜ θορύβου στην ζώνη των VLF, εντοπίσθηκε ότι η κύρια αιτία υπεύθυνη για την μορφολογία των sprites και των σχηματικών τους χαρακτηριστικών είναι η χωρική ανακατανομή ηλεκτρικού φορτίου μέσου εκκενώσεων ενδονεφικής προέλευσης (intracloud discharges). 4) Η αριθμητική επίλυση ενός χημικού ιονοσφαιρικού μοντέλου τεσσάρων κύριων φορτισμένων συστατικών, των οποίων η χρονική μεταβολή εκφράζεται από ένα ισάριθμο αριθμό συνήθων διαφορικών εξισώσεων συνέχειας, και η προσαρμογή των λύσεων αυτών στα πειραματικά δεδομένα, επέτρεψε για πρώτη φορά την εκτίμηση των επιπέδων ιονισμού που μπορεί να συνοδεύει τα sprites και τα ύψη στα οποία ο ιονισμός αυτός εντοπίζεται στην κατώτερη ιονόσφαιρα. 5) Δια της ανάλυσης χρονοσειρών υψηλής χρονικής ευκρίνειας, ανακαλύφθηκε μια νέα κατηγορία παλμικής διαταραχής του ΗΜ κύματος VLF που λαβαίνει χώρα ταυτόχρονα με τα sprites, η οποία χαρακτηρίζεται από μια βραδεία αύξηση του πλάτους του σήματος αμέσως μετά την περαίωση του οπτικού φαινομένου. Αυτή η παρατήρηση συνεπάγεται την δράση μιας παρατεταμένης πηγής ηλεκτρικής ενέργειας που επαυξάνει σταδιακά την διαταραχή της ηλεκτρικής αγωγιμότητας της περιοχής της κατώτερης ιονόσφαιρας πάνω από την κεραυνο-καταιγίδα. Λεπτομερής ανάλυση του ΗΜ θορύβου στην περιοχή VLF του φάσματος, οδήγησε σε ένα μηχανισμό ερμηνείας που θεωρεί ότι η αιτία της βραδείας αύξησης της διαταραχής είναι ομάδες πυκνών ενδονεφικών ηλεκτρικών εκκενώσεων που εκπέμπουν πακέτο ΗΜ παλμών. Στη συνέχεια, οι παλμοί αυτοί φτάνουν στην κατώτερη ιονόσφαιρα όπου ενεργοποιούν τα πρωτογενή ηλεκτρόνια των sprites και έτσι οδηγούν σε κατακλυσμιαία παραγωγή δευτερογενών ηλεκτρονίων και συνεπώς σε μια σταδιακή συσσώρευση ιονισμού. 6) Η παρούσα εργασία οδήγησε για πρώτη φορά στην πειραματική επαλήθευση θεωρητικών προβλέψεων σύμφωνα με τις οποίες τα στιγμιαία οπτικά φαινόμενα των elves συνοδεύονται με παραγωγή ελεύθερων ηλεκτρονίων σε ύψη άνω των 80 km. 7) Λεπτομερής διερεύνηση των χαρακτηρι-στικών της απόκρισης μαγνητομετρικών συστημάτων μέτρησης ΗΜ θορύβου στην ζώνη των «άκρως χαμηλών συχνοτήτων» (ULF, f < 10 Hz), έδειξε ότι δεν υπάρχει κάποια ειδοποιός διαφορά στις +CG ηλεκτρικές εκκενώσεις που οδηγούν σε sprites, σε σχέση με αυτές που δεν οδηγούν. Αυτό το (αρνητικό) εύρημα αποδυναμώνει προηγούμενες παραδοχές για το αντίθετο οι οποίες βασίζονταν στην ύπαρξη «μακρόβιων» συνεχών ρευμάτων (που μπορεί να επηρεάζουν και συνεπώς να αποτυπώνονται στην ζώνη των ULF) μόνο σε εκείνες τις +CG κεραυνικές εκκενώσεις που οδηγούν στην δημιουργία sprites στην ανώτερη ατμόσφαιρα. 8) Τελικά, επιχειρήθηκε η βελτίωση υπάρχοντος μοντέλου σκέδασης VLF κυμάτων από ένα σύνολο αγώγιμων κυλίνδρων ταυτόσημων με κατακόρυφες δομές sprites, οι οποίοι ενεργούν ως στοιχεία δευτερογενούς ακτινοβολίας του προσπίπτοντος κύματος. Τα νέα χαρακτηριστικά του μοντέλου αυτού, ως προς το υπάρχον, είναι ότι λαμβάνει υπόψη την ΗΜ αλληλεπίδραση των στοιχείων ακτινοβολίας και την μεταβολή των ηλεκτρικών τους ιδιοτήτων με το ύψος. Τα αποτελέσματα δείχνουν ότι το μοντέλο αυτό μπορεί να χρησιμοποιηθεί για την προσομοίωση των μεταβολών στο σήμα VLF που οφείλονται στην σκέδαση του κύματος από διαταραχές στο ιονοσφαιρικό πλάσμα λόγω της δράσης της ηλεκτρικής ενέργειας που δημιουργεί ταυτόχρονα και τα sprites...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{impact of}} {{lightning}} on humans and its threats on life and structures have encouraged the scientists to pursue study in this field. Lightning flash {{is a high}} current electric discharge that can be classified into five categories which are intra-cloud discharges, cloud to cloud, cloud to air, ground to cloud and cloud to <b>ground</b> <b>discharges.</b> Intra-cloud discharges have the main portion of the lightning flashes. The most damages and disturbances of lightning flashes are due to cloud to ground and ground to cloud flashes. The discharge phenomenon has various behaviors even in the same thunderstorm. The cloud to <b>ground</b> lightning <b>discharge</b> starts with preliminary breakdown pulses followed by leaders which cause return strokes. The subsequent strokes happen after the first return stroke in a typical lightning flash, but in few flashes the discharges do not lead to any subsequent strokes. This research investigates on these types of flashes which are called isolated breakdown lightning flashes, in Malaysia. The isolated breakdown flashes have rarely been seen in tropical regions compared with temperate areas. Among 150 selected waveforms on 9 th May 2013 in our measurement station, only 10 isolated lightning flashes were observed in our dataset, which make up less than 7 % of total flashes in one thunderstorm...|$|R

40|$|A {{system for}} {{differentiating}} between cloud to cloud and cloud to <b>ground</b> lightning <b>discharges</b> is described which includes an electric field antenna that senses {{the rate of}} charge of an electric field produced by a lightning discharge. When the signal produced by the electric field exceeds a predetermined threshold, it {{is fed to a}} coincidence detector. A VHF antenna is also provided and generates a video signal responsive to a cloud to cloud lightning discharge, and this signal is fed through a level sensor, an inverter, to the coincidence detector simultaneously with the signal from the field detector. When signals from the electric field antenna and the VHF antenna appear at the coincidence detector simultaneously, such indicates that there is a cloud to cloud lightning discharge; whereas, when there is not a signal produced on the VHF antenna simultaneously with a signal produced by the field sensor, then a strike indicator connected to the coincidence detector indicates a cloud to <b>ground</b> lightning <b>discharge...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} some {{measurements}} of earth lightning {{made with the}} functional unit of the Galileo probe RF lightning experiment are presented. The frequency range used is about 100 Hz to 100 kHz. The measurements were carried out in conjunction with simultaneous studies of lightning sources made by the University of Florida lightning research group. It is found that the typical RF pulse duration times are less than 30 microsec, independent of lightning source distance (less than 250 km). It is {{also found that the}} time between successive pulses is either quite short (less than 64 microsec), corresponding to the time between intracloud pulses and to the time between bipolar pulses, or occur around 100 ms, corresponding to the time between return strokes in <b>ground</b> <b>discharges.</b> The RF spectra are found to become less steep (relatively more power at the higher frequencies) during an interval of intense, nearby (less than 150 km) storms...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to examine the}} evolution of radar echoes and lightning attending the convective storms in mesoscale convective systems (MCS) and {{the relationships between the}} spatial and temporal evolution of deep convection and the storm environment, precipitation, severe weather, and lightning. The total number of <b>ground</b> <b>discharges</b> ranges from 10, 000 to 30, 000 over the life cycle of the MCS with peak sustained rates (for up to 10 consecutive hours) in excess of 2000 per hour. The peak lightning activity occurs from 5 to 20 hours after the first storms and anywhere from 7 hours prior to 7 hours after the time of the maximum areal extent of the MCS for very similar synoptic environments. Thus, it appears that mesoscale and sub-synoptic scale mechanisms are responsible for these large temporal variation in lightning activity. In addition, we have found that the lightning rates in MCS's are not related to either the size or the duration of the MCS. Preliminary results suggest that the MCA's with embedded squall lines produce the greatest flash rates...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedWater {{column and}} {{sediment}} samples collected from Newport Bay, CA, were analyzed for radium and radon during February, April, August, and October, 2004 to quantify <b>ground</b> water <b>discharge</b> and benthic exchange. In-situ fluxes measured with chambers were enhanced from diffusive fluxes by factors of 1. 5, 2. 3, and 4. 5 for Ra- 224, Ra- 223, and Rn- 222, respectively, showing that isotopic flux enhancements correlate with increasing scale length {{as a result}} of irrigation. Budgets constructed for each isotope established an upper limit for <b>ground</b> water <b>discharge</b> of 0. 09 ± 0. 14 m 3 /s in April and 0. 12 ± 0. 17 m 3 /s in August, less than 4 % of fresh water input. Tidal pumping supplied fluxes of Ra- 223 and Ra- 224 ~ 2. 5 times that of diffusion and irrigation. Transport models were constructed to evaluate mixing and potentially localized inputs. The predicted diffusivity was 85 - 145 m 2 /s, indicating that mixing may be driven by two-layer flow, rather than diffusive exchange of eddies...|$|R
40|$|The {{electrical}} {{behavior of}} thunderstorms triggered by local heating and sea-breeze convergence, a low pressure disturbance, and a weak frontal passage {{has been studied}} at the NASA Kennedy Space Center, Florida. A nonlinear least-squares minimization procedure has been developed to describe changes in the total electrostatic field produced by lightning in terms of point charge models for the cloud charge distributions. The results indicate that <b>discharges</b> to <b>ground</b> usually neutralize cloud charges {{in the range from}} - 10 to - 40 C. The computed charge altitudes for Florida are somewhat higher than for other geographical locations, 6 to 9. 5 km, but the corresponding ambient air temperatures, - 10 to - 34 C, are similar. A large fraction of the <b>discharges</b> to <b>ground</b> show total field changes which are small or even reversed in polarity within 3 km of the discharges. It is suggested that <b>ground</b> <b>discharges</b> often neutralize a small positive charge, 0. 5 to 4 C at altitudes of 1 to 3 km, in addition to the larger negative charge higher in the cloud...|$|R
