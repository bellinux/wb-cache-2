The measurement band falls (3. 6 - 6 GHz) in the frequency range allowed by the FCC ruling for ultrawide-band (UWB) operations.

A literature survey of "DE and testing methodologies as related to rocks was performed. Also, Mars Expedition Rover technology was assessed to understand the requirements for instrumentation in harsh space environments (e. g. temperature).

40|$|Abstract — We {{revisit the}} {{question}} of state space {{in the context of}} performing loop closure. Although a relative state space has been previously discounted, we show that such a state space is actually extremely powerful, able to achieve recognizable results after just one iteration. The power behind the technique (called POReSS) is the coupling between parameters that causes the orientation of one node to affect the position and orientation of other nodes. At the same time, the approach is fast because, like the more popular <b>incremental</b> state <b>space,</b> the Jacobian never needs to be explicitly computed. Furthermore, we show that while POReSS is able to quickly compute a solution near the global optimum, it is not precise enough to perform the fine adjustments necessary to reach the global minimum. As a result, we augment POReSS with a fast variant of Gauss-Seidel (called Graph-Seidel) on a global state space to allow the solution to settle closer to the global minimum. We show that this combination of POReSS and Graph-Seidel converges more quickly and scales to very large graphs better than other techniques {{while at the same time}} computing a competitive residual.

40|$|We {{present a}} novel method for {{estimating}} {{the power of}} sequential CMOS circuits. Symbolic probabilistic power estimation with an enumerated state space is used to estimate the average power switched by the circuit. This approach is more accurate than simulation based methods. Automatic circuit partitioning and state space exploration provide improvements in run-time and storage requirements over existing approaches. Circuits are automatically partitioned to improve the execution time and to allow larger circuits to be processed. Spatial correlation is dealt with by minimizing the cutset between partitions which tends to keep areas of reconvergent fanout in the same partition. Circuit partitions can be recombined using our combinational estimation methods which allow the exploitation of knowledge of probabilities of the circuit inputs. We enumerate the state transition graph (STG) incrementally using state space exploration methods developed for formal verification. Portions of the STG are generated on an as-needed basis, and thrown away after they are processed. BDDs are used to compactly represent similar states. This saves significant space in the storage of the STG. Our results show that modeling the state space is imperative for accurate power estimation of sequential circuits, partitioning saves time, and <b>incremental</b> state <b>space</b> exploration saves storage space.

Unfortunately, as many association mining models, PARAS was designed for static data. Modern transaction databases undergo regular data updates that quickly invalidating existing rules or introducing new rules for the PARAS index.

A secondary objective was to see whether dyspnea (estimated discomfort experienced with breathing using the Borg 0 - 10 scale) and the oxygen consumption of the respiratory muscles are closely related across conditions. This would be expected if intramuscular sensory nerve fibres stimulated as a consequence of metabolic events contributed to this sensation.

During resistive loading total oxygen consumption increased from 239 mL/min (SD= 38. 2) to 299 mL/min (SD= 52. 3) and dyspnea increased to "very severe" (Borg scale 7. 5, SD= 1. 55).

The fiber posts were cemented using self-adhesive dual-polymerized resin cement (RelyX Unicem). The {{data were analyzed using}} a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the Tukey test. Results: There {{were no significant differences in}} the mean values for push-out bond strength between groups with different post diameters (P >. 05). However, the push-out bond strengths were significantly different between groups with different cement thicknesses, and group 4 yielded the highest bond strength (11. 7 ± 0. 4 MPa). For all groups, the apical third had the lowest bond strength value (P <. 05). Conclusion: The highest push-out bond strength values were obtained when one <b>incremental</b> oversized post <b>space</b> was used. Clinically, fiber post space has to provide an optimum cement thickness (around 120 µm) for adequate cementation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Many {{researchers}} have encountered {{the problem that}} the evolution of electronic circuits becomes exponentially more difficult when problems with {{an increasing number of}} outputs are tackled. Although this is an issue in both intrinsic and extrinsic evolution experiments, overcoming this problem is particularly challenging in the case of evolvable hardware, where logic and routing resources are constrained according to the given architecture. Consequently, the success of experiments also depends on how the inputs and outputs are interfaced to the evolvable hardware. Various approaches have been made to solve the multiple output problem: partitioning the task with respect to the input or output <b>space,</b> <b>incremental</b> evolution of sub-tasks or resource allocation. However, in most cases, the proposed methods can only be applied in the case of extrinsic evolution. In this paper, we have accordingly, focused on scaling problem of increasing numbers of outputs when logic circuits are intrinsically evolved. We raise a number of questions: how big is the performance drop when increasing the number of outputs? Can the resources of evolvable hardware be struc-tured in a suitable way to overcome the complexity imposed by multiple outputs, without including knowledge about the problem domain? Can available resources in hardware still be efficiently used when pre-structured? In order to answer these questions, different structural implementations are investigated. We have looked at these issues in solving three problems: 4 -bit parity, 2 -bit adder and 2 -bit multiplier. I...|$|R
40|$|The {{localized}} linear discriminant network (LLDN) {{has been}} designed to address classification problems containing relatively closely spaced data from different classes (encounter zones [1], the accuracy problem [2]). Locally trained hyper-plane segments are an effective way to define the decision boundaries for these regions [3]. The LLD uses a modified perceptron training algorithm for effective discovery of separating hyperplane/sigmoid units within narrow boundaries. The basic unit of the network is the discriminant receptive field (DRF) which combines the LLD function with Gaussians representing the dispersion of the local training data with respect to the hyperplane. The DRF implements a local distance mea-sure [4], and obtains the benefits of networks oflocalized units [5]. A constructive algorithm for the two-class case is described which incorporates DRF's into the hidden layer to solve local discrimination problems. The output unit produces a smoothed, piecewise linear decision boundary. Preliminary results indicate the ability of the LLDN to efficiently achieve separation when boundaries are narrow and complex, in cases where both the "standard " multilayer perceptron (MLP) and k-nearest neighbor (KNN) yield high error rates on training data. 1 The LLD Training Algorithm and DRF Generation The LLD is defined by the hyperplane normal vector V and its "midpoint " M (a translated origin [1] near the center of gravity of the training data in feature <b>space).</b> <b>Incremental</b> corrections to V and M accrue for each training token feature vector Y j in the training set, as iIlustrated in figure 1 (exaggerated magnitudes).
