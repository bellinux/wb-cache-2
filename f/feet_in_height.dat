5|$|On November 20 the Chinese Army {{and teams}} of conscripted laborers began to hurriedly bolster Nanking's {{defenses}} {{both inside and}} outside the city. Nanking itself was surrounded by formidable stone walls stretching almost fifty kilometers (31 miles) around the entire city. The walls, which had been constructed hundreds of years earlier during the Ming Dynasty, rose up to twenty meters (65 <b>feet)</b> <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> were nine meters (30 feet) thick, and had been studded with machine gun emplacements. By December 6 all the gates into the city had been closed and then barricaded with an additional layer of sandbags and concrete six meters (20 feet) thick.|$|E
5|$|The tomb {{was built}} from sarsen borders that were {{arranged}} as two trilithons, and was oriented almost east to west. As with {{four of the}} other Medway Megaliths, {{it appears to have}} been oriented toward either the Medway Valley or the North Downs. The chamber was a trapezoid in its shape, measuring about 12 feet long and 7-and-a-half feet wide. The chamber was likely 10 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height.</b> It is likely that the entrance to the chamber was almost entirely blocked by a large stone, designated 'G' by excavators. Although {{it is difficult to determine}} the precise original layout of the chamber as a result of damage caused by medieval robbers, it appears likely that a medial stone divided the chamber in two. Furthermore, within the chamber, a drystone wall would have also blocked access.|$|E

25|$|A {{prominent}} {{feature of}} the Basilica's exterior is the large copper dome. The dome, measuring 165 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> was second in size only to the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. {{at the time of}} its completion in 1926. Over the years, the dome's original copper has aged to a green patina, as expected. Four copper angel statues playing trumpets, measuring 18 feet tall, are mounted on the dome.|$|E
25|$|In 1752, Captain Paul Augustin Le Pelletier de La Houssaye, {{the next}} commander, rebuilt the post's {{important}} {{structures such as}} the barrack, prison, and powder magazine.

They are invariably placed in a separate hall, on a pedestal of about three <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> usually to the north-east of the sanctum sanctorum.|$|E
25|$|In {{northwest}} Indiana {{there are}} various sand ridges and dunes, some reaching nearly 200 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height.</b> These are located along the Lake Michigan shoreline and also inland to the Kankakee Outwash Plain. Southern Indiana is characterized by valleys and rugged, hilly terrain, contrasting from much of the state. Here, bedrock is exposed at the surface and isn't buried in glacial till like further north. Because of the prevalent Indiana limestone, there are numerous caves, caverns, and quarries in the area.|$|E

60|$|I {{followed}} her, {{and sliding}} down {{the end of the}} stone--which I remember scratched my elbow and made it bleed--found myself in a little room about twelve <b>feet</b> square. <b>In</b> this place there was but one thing to be seen: {{what appeared to be the}} trunk of a great oak tree, some nine <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> length, and, standing on it, side by side, two figures of bronze under a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>height.</b>|$|R

25|$|That part of Madagascar where Fort Dauphin is {{situated}} is very populous. Almost all the villages {{are built on}} eminences; they are surrounded by two rows of strong palisades, and within these there is a parapet of earth four <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height.</b> Large bamboos, {{placed at a distance}} of five feet from each other and sunk to a considerable depth in the ground, serve to strengthen the palisades...some of these villages are fortified also by a ditch ten feet in breadth and six in depth.|$|E
25|$|From 1858 to 1861, {{the state}} took over levee building, {{accomplishing}} it through contractors and hired labor. In those years, planters considered their slaves too valuable to hire out for such dangerous work. Contractors hired gangs of Irish immigrant laborers to build levees and sometimes clear land. Many of the Irish were relatively recent {{immigrants from the}} famine years who were struggling to get established. Before the American Civil War, the earthwork levees averaged six <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> although in some areas they reached twenty feet.|$|E
25|$|The main façade is {{dominated}} by the bell tower and the assertive semi-circular apse, which features a blind arcade of simple columns and Romanesque arches. The blind arcade is broken at both ends by large stained glass windows. Just north of the apse exists the bell tower, which was originally topped by an impressive spire of over 200 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height.</b> The weight of the spire was more than the foundation could support, and it was removed from the structure in 1869 in order to prevent damaging the foundation.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of pulque {{is complex and}} required {{the death of the}} maguey plant. As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to send up a single flower stalk, which may reach up to 20 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height.</b> However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18inches in diameter. In this center, the maguey sap, known as aguamiel (honeywater), collects. It takes a maguey plant 12 years to mature enough to produce the sap for pulque.|$|E
25|$|These {{interior}} poles, typically 7 to 10 <b>feet</b> <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> {{are usually}} shorter than exterior poles. The interior posts support the roof beam of a clan house {{and include a}} large notch at the top, where the beam can rest. A clan house may have two to four or more house posts, depending on the native group who built it. Carvings on these poles, {{like those of the}} house frontal poles, are often used as a storytelling device for children and help {{tell the story of the}} owners' family history.|$|E

The authorities were informed {{of what was going on}} and a detachment of the 23rd Regiment of Foot (Royal Welsh Fusiliers) was sent to undo the work before the barricades could be armed. Some of the men who ran off when the army showed up regrouped and decided to attack the houses of Lafontaine and the boarding house where Baldwin was residing.|$|E

60|$|In {{the spring}} of the {{succeeding}} year (1869) the three crossed plants in Pot 1 had all grown to nearly a <b>foot</b> <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> and they had smothered the three little self-fertilised plants so completely that two were dead; and the third, only {{an inch and a}} half <b>in</b> <b>height,</b> was dying. It should be remembered that these plants had been bedded out in their pots, so that they were subjected to very severe competition. This pot was now thrown away.|$|R
