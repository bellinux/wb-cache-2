5|$|These 7.5cm (3in) long {{chandelier}} earrings made by Cartier in 1929 {{have three}} large drops adorned with every modern cut of diamond. The earrings were purchased by Margaret Greville, who left {{them to her}} friend the Queen Mother in 1942, and Elizabeth's parents gave them to her in 1947 as a wedding present. However, she {{was not able to}} use them until she had <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> pierced. When the public noticed that <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> had been pierced, doctors and jewellers found themselves inundated with requests by women anxious to have their ears pierced too.|$|E
5|$|File:Paolo Ucello 001.jpg|A Young Lady of Fashion is {{attributed}} to the Florentine painter and mathematician Paolo Uccello and dates early 1460s. The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of her forehead, and a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E
5|$|Laika is memorialised in {{the form}} of a statue and plaque at Star City, Russia, the Russian Cosmonaut {{training}} facility. Created in 1997, Laika is positioned behind the cosmonauts with <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> erect. The Monument to the Conquerors of Space, constructed in 1964, also includes Laika. On 11 April 2008 at the military research facility where staff had been responsible for readying Laika for the flight, officials unveiled a monument of her poised on top of a space rocket. Stamps and envelopes picturing Laika were produced, as well as branded cigarettes and matches.|$|E
6000|$|Father {{rounded the}} table, stealthily and treacherously put his lips at <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> and blew a {{tremendous}} [...] "Zzzzzzzz," [...] which buzzed in <b>her</b> <b>ear</b> like a file on a saw-blade.|$|R
60|$|But he {{had jumped}} up and put his face against hers--or rather against <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> <b>her</b> face being inaccessible.|$|R
60|$|He {{prepared}} to whisper in <b>her</b> <b>ear,</b> then, {{with a sudden}} excess of caution, crossed the room swiftly, opened the door, and looked out. When he sat down again he drew his chair so close to hers that the arms touched, and when he whispered his beard tickled <b>her</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{game has}} three playable {{character}}s; Lilac, Carol, and Milla. Melee attacks {{that can be}} used on enemies, and each character has a unique array of moves which allow them to traverse the environment in different ways. Lilac can perform a double-jump attack and can launch herself into an air dash, allowing her to bounce off walls and reach high areas. Carol is able to curl into a spin-attack while running and can climb up walls. By picking up gas canisters, Carol can bring out her motorcycle, which can double-jump and ride up vertical walls. Milla can throw gelatinous cubes and put up an offensive shield, combining the two to perform a Shield Blast, and flap <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> to reach high areas.|$|E
5|$|The Dhumavati Tantra {{describes}} {{her as an}} old and ugly widow. She is thin, tall, unhealthy, and has a pale complexion. She is described as restless and wicked. Unadorned with jewellery, she wears old, dirty clothes and has dishevelled hair. Her eyes are fearsome, her nose long and crooked, {{and some of her}} long fang-like teeth have fallen out, leaving her smile with gaps. <b>Her</b> <b>ears</b> are ugly and rough; her breasts hang down. In one of her trembling hands, she holds a winnowing basket, while the other makes a boon-conferring gesture (varada-mudra) or knowledge-giving gesture (cinmudra). She rides in a horseless chariot bearing an emblem of a crow and a banner. She is astute and crafty, though. Always hungry and thirsty, Dhumavati initiates quarrels and invokes fear.|$|E
5|$|The {{player can}} select any two-member {{permutation}} of its five playable characters: Sonic the Hedgehog, Tails, Amy Rose, Knuckles the Echidna, and Cream the Rabbit, provided the two desired characters have been unlocked; only Sonic and Tails {{are available at}} the beginning, while the other three must be rescued from Eggman {{over the course of the}} game. Each character has a unique ability: Sonic can perform a spinning attack in mid-air, Tails can fly using his two tails as a propeller, Amy can smash enemies with her hammer, Knuckles can glide long distances and climb walls, and Cream can fly using <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> as wings and attack enemies with her Chao friend, Cheese. The second player character can also give powers to the first by pressing the R button; for example, pressing and holding R while Tails is the sidekick blasts both characters into the air. In addition, the second character will collect rings and destroy enemies the first has not. Outside the main game, there are two battle modes for two to four players, in which any of the characters can be selected: racing and Chao collecting.|$|E

500|$|In 2005, a {{director}} {{cut of the}} video leaked onto the Internet. It shows heavier scenes, like wounded and maimed soldiers, war scenes, images of poverty and death. In 2010, Slant Magazine placed this alternate video on the nineteenth place of decade's fifty best music videos list, stating: [...] "It isn't like either the video's message about viewing war {{as a form of}} popular entertainment or its striking, loaded images leave much room for misinterpretation. Prescient? Yes. Relevant? Surely. Subtle? Not so much." [...] This version of the video ends with the tossed grenade landing on the catwalk and Madonna putting her hands on <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b>|$|E
500|$|In The Virgin Tour, [...] "Into the Groove" [...] was {{the third}} song of the setlist. Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top, {{revealing}} her characteristic black bra. She had lacy leggings and crucifixes around her ear and her neck. Her hair was tied {{at the top and}} fell in unkempt manner around <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> She had a tambourine in her hand like her two male dancers, and together they sang the song while {{standing in front of a}} microphone, in tandem. The performance was included on the video release titled , shot in Detroit. She also performed it on her Live Aid concert on July 13, 1985.|$|E
500|$|On {{her final}} {{start of the}} year she met Ravensbury again in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 9 October. As the owners of Isinglass had turned down a {{challenge}} to run his horse against La Fleche, they were the only two runners and the mare, ridden by Watts started at odds of 1/3. La Fleche opened up a clear lead in the early stages and was never in danger of defeat, winning [...] "in a canter" [...] by eight lengths. As the mare galloped up the hill with <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> pricked, she was given an enthusiastic reception from the Newmarket crowd who knew they were witnessing her final race.|$|E

500|$|Throughout {{most of the}} game, Alyssa has a [...] "Panic Meter" [...] {{visible on}} screen. If she is scared by a Subordinate, {{attacked}} by a spirit or simply frightened by her surroundings, the meter will begin to rise. If it fills, she enters [...] "Panic mode". In this state, the screen starts flashing and Alyssa becomes difficult to control and begins stumbling and falling over. She is also unable to use holy water and cannot enter hiding spots. After a few seconds, she will momentarily freeze, covering <b>her</b> <b>ears.</b> Panic mode only lasts for {{a certain amount of}} time, and its duration can be reduced by using [...] "Lavender water". However, if she is hit by a Subordinate while in Panic Mode, she will die instantly.|$|E
500|$|In {{order to}} promote [...] "Everybody," [...] Madonna {{performed}} the track with backup dancers at Haoui Montaug's [...] "No Entiendes" [...] – a roving cabaret revue. In The Virgin Tour of 1985, Madonna wore a blue see-through crop-top which revealed her black bra, a purple skirt, lacy leggings and a brightly patterned jacket. She also wore crucifixes in her hair, and on <b>her</b> <b>ears</b> and neck. As the performance of [...] "Into the Groove" [...] ended, Madonna took the microphone and danced around the stage while singing [...] "Everybody". The performance {{was included in the}} home video release titled [...] Madonna sampled [...] "Everybody"'s line, [...] "Dance and sing, get up and do your thing" [...] during the opening bars of [...] "Express Yourself" [...] for the Blond Ambition World Tour.|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} the camera {{rotating}} around Walker at an intersection as he slowly raises his head, before he is shown walking down a shop-lined street. As the song begins, Walker starts singing in an empty narrow alleyway. Examples of broken people are shown, such as a girl being pushed around and teased before she plugs headphones into <b>her</b> <b>ears,</b> a man watching over a hospital patient, and individuals waiting for others to show up. Walker passes a bench of people reading newspapers with the respective headlines, [...] "Attacked", [...] "War", [...] "When Will It End?" [...] and [...] "Act of Hate", while the final newspaper headline reads [...] "Hope". At {{the end of the}} video the now [...] "unbroken" [...] characters shot in Martin Place are shown to be content, and Walker makes his way down a darkened alley.|$|E
