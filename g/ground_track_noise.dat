40|$|The {{results are}} {{reported}} of acoustic measurements {{made on the}} 747 aircraft during visual approach monitor evaluation approaches. This display is designed to improve approach and landing precision under visual flight rule conditions. The purpose of the acoustic portion of the test was to measure, evaluate, and identify the noise levels during various types of aircraft approaches. Six noise measurement sites were positioned on the centerline of the approach <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> The six <b>noise</b> measurement stations on the approach <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> were positioned between approximately 1 and 6 nautical miles from runway threshold. The 1 -nautical mile point {{was chosen as the}} beginning of the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> because it is specified as the approach measurement point in the FAA noise certification requirements. The 6 -nautical mile point was chosen for its proximity {{to the point where the}} approach is initiated...|$|R

30|$|The {{effects of}} {{satellite}} <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> changes of GRACE on monthly gravity field recoveries are investigated. In {{the case of}} a gravity field recovery using {{a relatively short period of}} a month or so, the variation of <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> affects the precision of the gravity field solutions. It is a serious problem when the solutions are employed for detecting temporal gravity changes which are almost at their detection limits. In this study, the recoveries of four-weekly gravity fields are simulated and the relation between the recovery precision and the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> is investigated. The result shows that the GRACE <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> of the year 2003 was in good condition for four-week gravity field recovery, but it will sometimes appear as worse cases as the orbit altitude decays. In those cases, the global standard deviations of geoid height errors will be about one order worse than the best case. From our simulation, <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> of around altitudes of 473, 448, 399, 350 and 337 km give insufficient spatial resolutions, even for gravity field recovery up to degree 30.|$|R

40|$|Science {{requirements}} for the GLAS mission demand that the laser altimeter be pointed to within 50 m of {{the location of the}} previous repeat <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> The satellite will be flown in a repeat orbit of 182 days. Operationally, the required pointing information will be determined on the ground using the nominal <b>ground</b> <b>track,</b> to which pointing is desired, and the current propagated orbit of the satellite as inputs to the roll computation algorithm developed by CCAR. The roll profile will be used to generate a set of fit coefficients which can be uploaded on a daily basis and used by the on-board attitude control system. In addition, an algorithm has been developed for computation of the associated command quaternions which will be necessary when pointing at targets of opportunity. It may be desirable in the future to perform the roll calculation in an autonomous real-time mode on-board the spacecraft. GPS can provide near real-time tracking of the satellite, and the nominal <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> can be stored in the on-board computer.

GLAS combined {{a precision}} surface LIDAR with a sensitive dual-wavelength cloud and aerosol LIDAR. The GLAS lasers emit infrared and visible laser pulses at 1064 and 532 nm wavelengths. As ICESat orbited, GLAS produces {{a series of}} approximately 70 m diameter laser spots that are separated by nearly 170 m along the spacecraft's <b>ground</b> <b>track.</b> During the commissioning phase of the mission, the ICESat was placed into an orbit which allowed the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> to repeat every 8 days.

The number of orbit revolutions between the two <b>ground</b> <b>tracks</b> that cross at this grid node are also calculated.

40|$|GTARG is a {{computer}} program used to design orbit maintenance maneuvers for the TOPEX/Poseidon satellite. These maneuvers ensure that the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> is kept within +/- 1 km with of an = 9. 9 day exact repeat pattern. Maneuver parameters are determined using either of two targeting strategies: longitude targeting, which maximizes the time between maneuvers, and time targeting, in which maneuvers are targeted to occur at specific intervals. The GTARG algorithm propagates nonsingular mean elements, taking into account anticipated error sigma's in orbit determination, Delta v execution, drag prediction and Delta v quantization. A satellite unique drag model is used which incorporates an approximate mean orbital Jacchia-Roberts atmosphere and a variable mean area model. Maneuver Delta v magnitudes are targeted to precisely maintain either the unbiased <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> itself, or a comfortable (3 sigma) error envelope about the unbiased <b>ground</b> <b>track...</b>|$|R
50|$|The four {{satellites}} are in sun-synchronous polar orbits with a 97.9° inclination at {{a nominal}} altitude of 619 km and an orbital period of 97.2 minutes.

The satellites are phased in the same orbital plane, with COSMO-SkyMed's 1, 2 and 4 at 90° to each other and COSMO-SkyMed 3 at 67.5° from COSMO-SkyMed 2. This results in varied intervals between the satellites along the same <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> of between 1 and 15 days.

50|$|Orbital {{inclination}} is {{the angle}} formed between {{the plane of}} an orbit and the equatorial plane of the Earth. The geographic latitudes covered by the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> will range from -i to i, where i is the orbital inclination. In other words, the greater the inclination of a satellite's orbit, the further north and south its <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> will pass.

40|$|In {{order to}} gain an {{understanding}} into the problem of eccentricity (e) and argument of perigee (omega) control for TOPEX/Poseidon, the two cases where the highest latitude crossing time {{and one of the}} equator crossings are held constant are investigated. Variations in e and omega cause a significant effect on the satellite's ground-track repeatability. Maintaining e and omega near their frozen values will minimize this variation. Analytical expressions are found to express this relationship while keeping an arbitrary point of the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> fixed. The initial offset of the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> from its nominal path determines the subsequent evolution of e and omega about their frozen values. This long-term behavior is numerically determined using an earth gravitational field including the first 17 zonal harmonics. The numerical results are plotted together with the analytical constraints to see if the later values of e and omega cause unacceptable deviation in the <b>ground</b> <b>track...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a comprehensive analytical approach for determining key maneuver parameters {{associated with the}} acquisition and maintenance of the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> for a low-earth orbit. A livearized model relating changes in the drift rate of the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> directly {{to changes in the}} orbital semi-major axis is also developed. The effect of terrestrial atmospheric drag on the semi-major axis is also explored, being quantified through an analytical expression for the decay rate as a function of density. The non-singular Lagrange planetary equations, further simplified for nearly circular orbits, provide the desired relationships between the corrective in-plane impulsive velocity increments and the corresponding effects on the orbit elements. The resulting solution strategy offers excellent insight into the dynamics affecting the timing, magnitude, and frequency of these maneuvers. Simulations are executed for the <b>ground</b> <b>track</b> acquisition and maintenance maneuver as a pre-flight planning and analysis...|$|R
