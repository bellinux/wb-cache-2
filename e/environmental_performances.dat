50|$|The {{decreased}} {{health status}} of pigs, {{as a consequence of}} roundworm infection, is reflected in general production parameters like daily weight gain, feed conversion efficiency and meat quality. However, in farms with low infection levels, the effect of infection is expected to be minimal and the economical profitability of active Ascaris control can be questioned. It is difficult to determine the economical losses due to parasites that are not lethal. There are numerous interactions between the worm, the host, the presence of other diseases, the production system and many other factors. Recent evaluations of the economical performance of infected pig farms has indicated that the improved feed conversion, increased daily weight gain, lower mortality and better carcass quality act in a synergetic way. Hence, strategic deworming should result in a win-win effect on economic and <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> with gross profit margin increases of 3 to 12 euro per average present finisher per year. To distinguish between pig populations that suffer significant economical damage and those that are less affected, we depend on the availability of diagnostic tools to provide us with information on the presence and infection pressure of this parasite on a farm. If interpreted correctly, diagnostic tools can be of use to evaluate the applied control strategies and see whether efforts for parasite control need to be increased or changed.|$|E

40|$|Purpose– The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a fuzzy‐analysis‐based scoring (F‐EPS) method for {{measuring}} contractors' <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> during project construction in order to assist contractors in improving their <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> during project construction. Design/methodology/approach– To review relevant literature and conduct practical investigations for establishing the indicators which measure the <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> made by contractors. This will be followed by establishing the performance benchmarks for measuring the performance level of the environmental indicators, and presenting a fuzzy‐analysis‐based scoring method for measuring a contractor's <b>environmental</b> <b>performance.</b> A practical case was adopted to demonstrate the procedures of applying the F‐EPS model. Findings– This paper provides an alternative method, fuzzy‐analysis‐based scoring (F‐EPS) method for assessing contractors' <b>environmental</b> <b>performance.</b> Whilst there are existing methods developed in previous studies for assessing the <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> of construction projects, it appears that little study has been conducted to investigate measuring the <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> by contractors during the construction process. Shen et al. (2005) suggested measuring contractors' <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> by using an <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> score (EPS). However, the major weakness of using the EPS model is that the model does not take into consideration the characteristics of the subjective and fuzzy assessment process. The F‐EPS method is thus developed to help mitigate these weaknesses. Practical implications– F‐EPS model provides a simple and easy‐to‐apply tool to assist contractors in identifying the poor <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> areas; thus corrective methods can be used to make improvement. It provides an effective method for contractors' <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> to be communicated to involved stakeholders. Originality/value– There are many variables affecting contractors' <b>environmental</b> <b>performance,</b> which present difficulties for measuring the performance efficiently and effectively. This paper has presented a new approach, a fuzzy‐analysis‐based method, for measuring the <b>environmental</b> <b>performance</b> used by contractors through applying the fuzzy analysis principles.

40|$|The goal of {{this paper}} is to study the {{influence}} of corporate environmental responsibility (CER) and national environmental standards on the location choices of the 600 biggest European firms. By using the environmental score provided by Vigeo, we are able to test the influence of the <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of firms. We find a negative interaction effect between these <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> and national environmental regulations. Thus, we argue that national standards can be a substitute for CER. All things being equal, firms with better <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> tend to be located in dirtier countries. CER can therefore be seen as an answer to the location choices of firms which invest in countries with poor environmental policies. This result is only valid when considering de facto environmental standards, not de jure environmental standards.

The article describes and comments the results of a representative sample of LCA studies, most of them published in international journals or in free access research reports. All analyzed LCA studies compare wood, as a building system, with other materials and construction technologies (such as reinforced concrete, steel and masonry); these studies highlight the potential of wood-based building materials to improve the <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> of construction industry besides the possible negative aspects related to the wood product manufacturing and the construction process. Some methodological limits are considered comparing LCA results among selected studies, because of the variability of the case studies, the subjectivity of the system boundary definition and the differences between the referenced data sources. However the comparative purpose of this analysis provides an interesting framework of the current research and highlights how timber buildings and wood-based products could still improve their <b>environmental</b> <b>performances</b> during all life cycle stages.
