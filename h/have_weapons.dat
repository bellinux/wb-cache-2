5|$|Each {{level has}} the player follow a linear path through waves of enemies and culminates with a boss. In boss stages the player's craft {{does not move}} forward, but hovers {{in front of the}} boss. Each boss has a single {{vulnerability}} which flashes when hit. These areas are often heavily shielded and must be hit repeatedly to remove armor. Other bosses' vulnerabilities are hidden and appear for only short periods. Most bosses <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> that fire upon the player or reflect the player's shots. At the end of each level, players receive bonuses for defeated enemies, lives remaining, and the energy level of the player's craft. An extra life is granted if the score reaches certain thresholds.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the Ottoman {{invasion}} was {{not considered}} as a significant threat by both Bulgarians and Byzantines. For only one decade between 1354 and 1364 the Ottomans conquered virtually the whole of Thrace seizing large cities such as Plovdiv, Beroia, Dianopolis (Yambol) and Adrianople and defeating several small Bulgarian forces. The centuries-old mistrust between Bulgarians and Byzantines spoiled the negotiations between the two empires for an alliance and even led to the last Byzantine-Bulgarian war in 1364. In 1371 a large Bulgarian-Serb army under Vukašin Mrnjavčević and Jovan Uglješa, two feudal lords in Macedonia, was annihilated by the Ottomans under Lala Shahin Pasha at Chernomen and soon the Bulgarian Emperor had to admit the defeat and became a vassal to the invaders. Numerous Bulgarian fortresses in the Rhodope mountains, Sofia valley and eastern Bulgaria were captured one by one over the next twenty years. In 1393 the capital Tarnovo was besieged and seized by the Ottoman Turks and three years later fell Vidin - the last major Bulgarian city. Resistance to the invaders continued until 1422 when the country was fully conquered. The Ottoman invasion was {{a disaster for the}} Bulgarian army— the nobility and the leaders of the nation were killed or emigrated and civilians were not allowed to <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> until the 19th century.|$|E

500|$|Deep Blue Sea was {{inspired}} by Australian screenwriter Duncan Kennedy after he witnessed a [...] "horrific" [...] shark attack on a beach near his home. The tragedy contributed to a recurring nightmare of him [...] "being in a passageway with sharks that could read his mind". This motivated him to write a spec script, while acknowledging the challenge of approaching a shark movie without repeating Steven Spielberg's 1975 classic Jaws. Although Warner Bros. bought the script in late 1994, actual development on the project did not start until two years later. When Renny Harlin was chosen to direct the film, Kennedy's screenplay, which had already been re-written by several writers at Warner Bros., was presented to Donna Powers and Wayne Powers, who turned it into the film's final script. According to Wayne, [...] "The movie became essentially what we wrote. The draft we were first presented by [...] was {{much more of a}} military espionage, high-tech action movie, grenade launchers, that kind of thing. We wanted our team to include more blue-collar types and not to <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> to fight back, to play it more as a horror film." ...|$|E

500|$|Seven CBS Sports analysts {{predicted}} a Bears victory, with Pete Prisco {{being the only}} one to favor the Browns. Jeff Joniak stated that the Bears had to attack the Browns' 3–4 defense, who ranked third in yards per pass attempt allowed at 5.32, with their fifth-ranked passing offense. Chicago's wide receiver duo of Marshall and Alshon Jeffery should also be utilized, as Joe Haden and Buster Skrine are at a size mismatch (Marshall is 5 inches and 40 pounds larger than Haden, while Jeffery is 6 inches and 30 pounds heavier than Skrine). Browns offensive coordinator Ray Horton commented, [...] "This team, Chicago, is a lot like Detroit in that they <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> at every position. Brandon Marshall and Alshon Jeffery have the most catches in the league. They have the most combined yards in the league. They are both, in our mind, No. 1 receivers. They present a challenge that you can’t double everybody. You can’t roll up to one guy because the other guy’s open." [...] On defense, the Bears had to contain Josh Gordon and Jordan Cameron. Gordon ranks second in yards after catch, while leading all receivers with 71 for an average of 19.7 yards. Cameron leads all tight ends with 23 third down catches. The Bears' worst-ranked run defense also has to defend against the Browns, which had the third-fewest rushing attempts in the league with 290 with an average of 3.78 yards, {{which is one of the}} bottom six in the league.|$|E

The main formed units were the 2nd New Zealand Division, less the 6th Brigade and division headquarters; the 19th Australian Brigade Group; and the 14th Infantry Brigade of the British 6th Division.

2500|$|Each extant {{panel is}} {{dominated}} by a single horizontal line in which Christ is centrally positioned. Examination of the underdrawings show that the artist frequently deviated from his preliminary sketches, {{an indication of the}} looseness and freshness of his overall approach. The images are flat as they are completed before the advent of perspective. They are the more remarkable for the rich and precisely rendered small details, and use of glazes, given that they were completed before the development of oil painting some 30 years later. According to art historian Robert Suckale, [...] "never before <b>have</b> <b>weapons</b> appeared sharper or shields more spiked." [...] The painting is quintessentially Gothic and does not evidence any Italian influence. Rather it can be within the tradition of Bohemian painting, or possibly Franco-Flemish art. Its innovative use of light may be traced to the techniques of the Master Theoderic, while the positioning of the knight below Christ in the Resurrection references the Christ child in the c 1350 Italian-Byzantium icon, the Eichhorn Madonna.|$|E

2500|$|IDF {{chief of}} staff (Ramatkal) Shaul Mofaz urged the {{officers}} to speed things up. They asked for twenty-four more hours. Mofaz told reporters that the fighting would be complete {{by the end of}} the week, April 6. In some of the sectors, the forces were advancing at a rate of fifty meters a day. Israeli intelligence assumed that the vast majority of the camp's residents were still in it. Most commanders argued that this obligated a careful advance for fear of striking civilians, and warned that using excessive force would cost the lives of hundreds of Palestinians. Lieutenant Colonel Ofek Buchris, commander of the 51st Battalion, was left in a minority opinion, saying [...] "We're being humiliated here for four days now". When Mofaz instructed the officers to be more aggressive and fire five antitank missiles at every house before entering, one of them contemplated disobedience. Meanwhile, when asked how long he thought his forces could last given the superiority of the Israeli forces, Abu Jandal said: [...] "No. That's not true. We have the weapon of surprise.
