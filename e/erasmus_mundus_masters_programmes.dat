40|$|Joint <b>master</b> <b>programmes</b> are systems {{which by}} default demand a proper quality system {{in order to}} sustain and improve. Objective of this thesis is {{analysing}} and proposing solutions to difficulties associated {{with the implementation of}} a quality management system to joint <b>master</b> <b>programmes,</b> with the focus on international joint <b>master</b> <b>programmes.</b> The application of the analysis to the <b>Erasmus</b> <b>Mundus</b> joint <b>master</b> <b>programme</b> European <b>Master</b> in Quality in Analytical Laboratories (EMQAL) is discussed. QA systems implementation in HEIs in Europe is an ongoing process, and implementation of such systems in JPs is one step further to enhancing quality in higher education in Europe. The issue closely discussed in this thesis is: should QMS be developed independently from the institutions, or should the institutions, when developing their quality management systems, take into account the (future) development of joint courses and prepare their quality procedures accordingly? A quality management system is normally developed for one organization, and different aspects of cooperation are considered within. A joint <b>master</b> <b>programme</b> is a result of successful cooperation of two or more organizations; therefore a development of its quality management system must be approached in a different manner. This thesis proposes a QMS with emphasis both on the HEI and the consortium. Different processes in the QMS can be managed independently {{at the level of the}} HEI or at the level of the consortium. Most processes in joint <b>master</b> <b>programmes</b> should be designed in programmes’ and institutions’ QMSs. Quality of a joint <b>master</b> <b>programme</b> cannot be analyzed separately from the higher education institutions which are organizing it. Comparative analysis of organization of one <b>Erasmus</b> <b>Mundus</b> <b>Master</b> <b>programme</b> to the solutions proposed in discussion showed that from all of the aspects considered, processes in EMQAL are organized in harmony with the proposed delegation of processes of the QMS for a joint <b>master</b> <b>programme.</b> The solutions proposed in the discussion are based on theoretical application of the quality principles and concepts. Comparison to the quality processes and procedures in an existing EM programme showed that analysis is applicable in practice...|$|R

Cape Creus is lately being subjected of study in order to assess its values in the frame of European Directives. By combining existing data of artisanal fisheries’ components together with gathered seabed components, a spatial distribution of fishing activity is pretended. A spatial approach has been the main tool when assessing the consistency of fishing pressure onto the seabed. Benthic communities seem to be more affected when overlapping of fishing types occur. Consequently, alternating parceling and seasonal closures among fishing gear types, to minimize the impact onto benthic communities as also setting no-take zones is strongly suggested. The establishment of a MPA in the near future has to be seen for all stakeholders as one step contributing to the sustainability of the ecosystem, once the potential impact of this fishing activity is shown. Mid-scale benefits by means of reducing fishing pressure in the area will enhance both alternative income solutions and spillover offset as a result of habitat recoveryThis work was presented by the first author in order to complete the requirements to achieve the degree of Master of Science in Marine Biodiversity and Conservation, within the <b>ERASMUS</b> <b>MUNDUS</b> <b>Master</b> <b>Programme</b> EMBCPeer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The {{scope of}} {{policies}} within universities and professional practices {{is becoming increasingly}} global {{and more and more}} networks of professionals and researchers are conducting collaborative programmes and research projects. Translating these collaborations into flourishing practices is often more challenging than initially anticipated especially if there is an international dimension. In these circumstances participants often experience challenges triggered by power relations, differences in culture, contexts, and perspectives on practice and research. This paper is underpinned by an educational psychology perspective and falls within an interpretive paradigm. The metaphor of the patchwork quilt is used during learning and teaching seminars to explain collaborative practice and research because the steps involved serve as a useful visual aid for further comparison and reflection. Using data from four studies, we discuss the experiences of international participants conducting collaborative research over the course of an international <b>Masters</b> <b>programme</b> in Europe and the experiences of alumni of the programme attempting to conduct research after the completion of the <b>Erasmus</b> <b>Mundus</b> (EM) <b>Masters</b> <b>Programme</b> We argue that international collaborative practice and research take time, especially in the initial stages.

40|$|The {{increase}} in trade and {{economies of scale}} has influenced ports in respect to the growth and services they provide. Ports as trade commercial centres, in which international markets and national economies meet, must start considering how the impacts of extreme climate change influence their port management and operations. This particular study focuses on extreme changes in climate that may affect the development, operations and infrastructure of ports. In particular, {{research has been done}} into sustainable mitigation plans that have been implemented by port authorities in relation to GHG emissions, energy consumption, fuel consumption, sea level rise and extreme weather protection and ice coverage, with the goal to analyse the potential environmental adaptability of ports operations to climate change effects. This study was based on a survey and case studies that provided primary and secondary data {{for the development of a}} comparative analysis among 10 different ports. The information gathered identified the range of measures and policies that ports are developing with a view to responding to climate change impacts. The study also uses Multi-Criteria Analysis to examine the degree of integration and adaptability of ports to climate change challenges, and the positive externalities such adaptations can bring to ports. In general 40 % of the ports investigated in this project have implemented not only GHG emissions and energy and fuel consumption mitigation plans but have also conducted research into the vulnerability of the port to sea level rise and extreme weather. The MCA results indicate that it is important for ports to start considering climate change impacts and developing sustainable mitigation and adaptation plans for their port operations in order to bring benefits to the port and the surrounding areas. This project is part of an <b>Erasmus</b> <b>Mundus</b> International <b>Masters</b> <b>Programme</b> in Coastal and Marine Engineering and Management (CoMEM).

Driven by the need of in-line monitoring of extrusion based processes, and by the necessity of better understanding the interplay between such process and the extrusion-induced structures in polymer engineering, a specific rheooptical slit device has been designed that allows the optical and rheological characterization of materials coming out of a mini-extrusion line which operates in the output range of tens of grams per hour, as opposed to kgs per hour outputs conventionally found in lab-scale extrusion machines. We first present the rheological and optical validation of the device, and then briefly show a set of result obtained with a model polymer blend.
