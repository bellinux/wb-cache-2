5|$|The {{antibiotics}} neomycin and metronidazole {{are other}} antibiotics {{used to treat}} hepatic encephalopathy. The rationale of their use {{was the fact that}} ammonia and other waste products are generated and converted by <b>intestinal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> and killing these bacteria would reduce the generation of these waste products. Neomycin was chosen because of its low intestinal absorption, as neomycin and similar aminoglycoside antibiotics may cause hearing loss and kidney failure if used by injection. Later studies showed that neomycin was indeed absorbed when taken by mouth, with resultant complications. Metronidazole, similarly, is less commonly used because prolonged use can cause nerve damage, in addition to gastrointestinal side effects.|$|E

25|$|Biotin {{deficiency}} is rare. The amounts needed are small, a {{wide range}} of foods contain biotin, and <b>intestinal</b> <b>bacteria</b> synthesize biotin, which is then absorbed by the host animal. For that reason, statutory agencies in many countries, for example the USA and Australia, have not formally established a recommended daily intake of biotin. Instead, an Adequate Intake (AI) is identified based on the theory that average intake meets needs. Future research could result in biotin AIs with EARs and RDAs (see Dietary Reference Intake section).|$|E

40|$|RIG-I–like receptors (RLRs) {{activate}} host innate immune responses against virus infection through recruiting the mitochondrial adaptor protein MAVS (also {{known as}} IPS 1, VISA, or CARDIF).

Bone marrow transplantation experiments revealed that MAVS in cells of nonhematopoietic origin plays a dominant role in the protection against colitis. Importantly, RNA species derived from <b>intestinal</b> commensal <b>bacteria</b> activate the RIG-I–MAVS pathway to induce the production of multiple cytokines and antimicrobial peptides, including IFN-β and RegIIIγ.

Probiotics taken in uncomplicated cases of SIBO can usually result in the individual becoming symptom free.

25|$|William Parker, Randy Bollinger, {{and colleagues}} at Duke University {{proposed}} in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria {{from the rest of}} the intestines. This proposal is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial <b>intestinal</b> <b>bacteria,</b> in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop–University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were four times more likely to have a recurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a safe house for good bacteria. This reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera, or boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
25|$|Unconjugated {{hyperbilirubinaemia}} in {{a newborn}} {{can lead to}} accumulation of bilirubin in certain brain regions (particularly the basal nuclei) with consequent irreversible damage to these areas manifesting as various neurological deficits, seizures, abnormal reflexes and eye movements. This type of neurological injury is known as kernicterus. The spectrum of clinical effect is called bilirubin encephalopathy. The neurotoxicity of neonatal hyperbilirubinemia manifests because the blood–brain barrier has yet to develop fully, and bilirubin can freely pass into the brain interstitium, whereas more developed individuals with increased bilirubin in the blood are protected. Aside from specific chronic medical conditions {{that may lead to}} hyperbilirubinaemia, neonates in general are at increased risk since they lack the <b>intestinal</b> <b>bacteria</b> that facilitate the breakdown and excretion of conjugated bilirubin in the faeces (this is largely why the faeces of a neonate are paler than those of an adult). Instead the conjugated bilirubin is converted back into the unconjugated form by the enzyme β-glucuronidase (in the gut, this enzyme is located in the brush border of the lining intestinal cells) and a large proportion is reabsorbed through the enterohepatic circulation.|$|E

40|$|A {{method is}} {{presented}} that uses b-strand interactions {{to predict the}} parallel right-handed b-helix super-secondary structural motif in protein sequences. A program called BetaWrap implements this method and is shown to score known b-helices above non-b-helices in the Protein Data Bank in cross-validation. It is demonstrated that BetaWrap learns {{each of the seven}} known SCOP b-helix families, when trained primarily on b-structures that are not b-helices, together with structural features of known b-helices from outside the family. BetaWrap also predicts many bacterial proteins of unknown structure to be b-helices; in particular, these proteins serve as virulence factors, adhesins, and toxins in bacterial pathogenesis and include cell surface proteins from Chlamydia and the <b>intestinal</b> <b>bacterium</b> Helicobacter pylori.

40|$|Abstract The <b>intestinal</b> <b>bacterium</b> Eubacterium sp. strain VPI 12708 {{has been}} shown to have a bile acid 7 a/ 7 pdehydroxylation pathway. A large bile acid {{inducible}} (bai) operon encoding at least 9 open reading frames has been cloned and sequenced from this bacterium.

40|$|Bifidobacteria are {{important}} {{members of the}} human gut flora, especially in infants. Comparative genomic analysis of two Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis strains revealed evolution by internal deletion of consec-utive spacer-repeat units within a novel clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat locus, which represented the largest differential content between the two genomes. Additionally, 47 single nucleotide polymorphisms were identified, consisting primarily of nonsynonymous mutations, indicating positive selection and/or recent divergence.
