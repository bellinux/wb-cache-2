5|$|By {{the time}} of the 1997 general election, polls {{suggested}} that <b>Eurosceptic</b> sentiment was running high in the UK, and the question of the country's ongoing membership of the EU was a topic of regular discussion in the media. Much of this press coverage took a negative stance toward the EU, mainstream newspapers like the Daily Mail, The Telegraph and The Times promoting <b>Eurosceptic</b> sentiment. Such debates were influenced by the UK's recent signing of the Maastricht Treaty and the looming possibility that the country would adopt the euro currency.|$|E

5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, the Referendum Party {{spent more}} on press advertising {{than either the}} incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Following the election, psephologists argued {{that the impact of}} the Referendum Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members reformed as a <b>Eurosceptic</b> pressure group called the Democracy Movement, and many others joined <b>Eurosceptic</b> political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.|$|E

40|$|Parliamentary {{discourse}} in the Netherlands has been characterised as “business-like” and dispassionate, with little of the theatrics and verbal duels that are such a recogniseable feature of their British neighbours. The recent upsurge in <b>Eurosceptics</b> seems to have infused some British-style parliamentary {{discourse in}}to the Dutch political sphere. This paper focused {{on the question of}} whether Dutch <b>Eurosceptics</b> share a significant portion of their discourse style with British MPs, specifically in the supranational context of the European Union. Features of British discourse style were found in previous authors, such as Ilie (2004), and Harris (2010), and operationalised along Brown & Levinson’s facework politeness theory. A corpus of parliamentary transcripts was selected, focusing on the speeches of Dutch <b>Eurosceptics</b> in the European Parliament, and analysed on the basis of whether they showed a significantly higher usage of unmitigated face-threatening acts and emotional language compared to mainstream parties, and the norm for Dutch members of parliament. The results show that there are similarities between <b>Eurosceptics</b> and British MPs discourse styles that may indicate that Dutch Euroscepticism is in some way influenced by British political culture...|$|R
40|$|Since the 1980 s, Britain’s Conservative Party {{has become}} {{increasingly}} critical of the European Union, and of the country’s membership of it. So contentious and controversial has this issue become {{that it was a}} significant factor in the downfall of three consecutive Conservative Prime Ministers, all of whom found it increasingly difficult to manage their Party in Parliament, and thereby maintain any semblance of Party unity. Initially, during the 1980 s and 1990 s, the intra-Party divisions were between Europhiles (pro-Europeans) and <b>Eurosceptics,</b> but this demarcation was subsequently superseded by a division between soft <b>Eurosceptics</b> and hard <b>Eurosceptics.</b> The development and deepening of these intra-Party divisions are attributable to a plethora of endogenous and exogenous factors, the combined and cumulative effect of which ultimately led to the ‘Brexit’ vote in the June 2016 referendum...|$|R
5|$|At {{the end of}} the Cold War, the FPÖ {{became more}} <b>eurosceptic,</b> which was {{reflected}} by its change from pan-Germanism to Austrian patriotism. The party's opposition to the European Union grew stronger in the 1990s. The FPÖ opposed Austria's joining the EU in 1994, and promoted a popular initiative against the replacement of the Austrian Schilling with the Euro in 1998, but to no avail. Owing to perceived differences between Turkish and European culture, the party opposes the accession of Turkey to the EU; it has declared that should this happen, Austria must immediately leave the EU.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe is a minor, <b>Eurosceptic</b> {{political}} {{party in the}} United Kingdom. The party has been registered since June 2012 but remained inactive until it was officially launched in October 2013 by current party leader Mike Nattrass, a disaffected member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP). It has no official political representation, but previously had one Member of the European Parliament (MEP) and three Councillors, {{all of whom were}} once members of UKIP.|$|E
5|$|On February 15, 2008, it was {{announced}} that the pro-Western Boris Tadić won the 2008 Serbian presidential election. The 2008 elections were particularly important to Serbia's relations with the United States, as the main challenging party which lost the election, SRS, disintegrated when Tomislav Nikolić split with Vojislav Šešelj over integration into the European Union. When Nikolić split from SRS and began pursuing a pro-European profile (a reversal from SRS's <b>eurosceptic</b> position), he was being advised by American lobbying firm Quinn Gillespie & Associates.|$|E

5|$|The Referendum Party was a <b>Eurosceptic,</b> single-issue {{political}} party that {{was active in}} the United Kingdom from 1994 to 1997. The party's sole objective was for a referendum to be held {{on the nature of the}} UK's membership of the European Union (EU). Specifically, it called for a referendum on whether the British people wanted to either be part of a federal European state or revert to being a sovereign nation that was part of a free-trade bloc without wider political functions.|$|E
5|$|By the 2006 general election, the FPÖ {{returned}} to promoting anti-immigration, anti-Islam and <b>Eurosceptic</b> issues. It won 11% {{of the vote}} and 21 seats in parliament, while the BZÖ only barely passed the 4% threshold needed to enter Parliament. The subsequent coalition between the SPÖ and the ÖVP left both parties in opposition. In the 2008 general election both the FPÖ and the BZÖ rose significantly {{at the expense of}} the SPÖ and the ÖVP. Both parties increased their percentage of the vote by about 6.5%, with the FPÖ at 17.4% and the BZÖ at 10.7%together gaining 28.2%, and thus both breaking the record vote for the FPÖ in the 1999 election. In the 2009 European Parliament election the FPÖ doubled its 2004 results, winning 12.8% of the vote and 2 seats.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a pressure group {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The <b>Eurosceptic</b> cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E
40|$|The {{idea of the}} Anglosphere is an {{important}} element of British Euroscepticism. Ben Wellings and Helen Baxendale show that calls for unity of purpose between English-speaking peoples offer <b>Eurosceptics</b> an alternative political community to the European Union, and one that aligns history, culture and politics more closely than does Britain’s membership of the EU. Although the Anglosphere does not yet constitute a viable political alternative to Britain’s EU membership, articulating it helps <b>Eurosceptics</b> imagine a UK outside the European Union...|$|R

5|$|Moore {{was known}} for his {{conservative}} political views. In the 1970s, he was chairman of the anti-immigration United Country Party, a position he held until the party was absorbed by the New Britain Party in 1980. He campaigned for the politician Edmund Iremonger at the 1979 general election, as they agreed the French and Germans were not to be trusted. Iremonger and Moore gave up political campaigning after deciding they were Thatcherites. Moore campaigned on behalf of Douglas Denny (UKIP) for the Chichester constituency in 2001. A Conservative voter for many years, he was a supporter and patron of the <b>eurosceptic</b> UK Independence Party until his death.|$|E
5|$|Before {{establishing}} the party, Mike Nattrass {{had long been}} involved with Britain's <b>Eurosceptic</b> movement. In 1994, Nattrass joined the New Britain Party and unsuccessfully stood for the group in the Dudley West by-election of the same year. Alike most New Britain candidates, Nattrass was absorbed into and stood in Solihull for the single-issue Referendum Party at the 1997 general election. Led by James Goldsmith, this party's policy was for a referendum to be held on the UK's relationship with the European Union (EU), specifically {{as to whether the}} British population {{wanted to be part of}} a federal European state or whether they wanted the EU to revert to being a free-trade bloc without wider political functions. Nattrass subsequently joined the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and eventually rose to the positions of Party Chairman and Deputy Leader. As the UKIP candidate, he was elected as a representative for the West Midlands constituency in the 2004 European Parliament election, and was re-elected in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Goldsmith {{had prior}} {{political}} experience, having been elected as a Member of the European Parliament (MEP) in France {{as part of}} the <b>Eurosceptic</b> Movement for France coalition in June 1994. Although his father had been a Member of Parliament representing Britain's Conservative Party, and he had personally had a close relationship to the party when it was led by Margaret Thatcher, Goldsmith wanted to launch his campaign independently of the Conservatives, hoping that it could draw on cross-party concerns about the direction of the EU. At the time of the party's formation, Goldsmith had an estimated personal wealth of £800 million, and promised to put £20 million into the party. He pledged to spend at least £10 million on campaigning for the next general election, to ensure that his party was funded to the same extent as the country's larger political parties. Goldsmith's intervention in British politics has been compared to that of the multi-millionaires Ross Perot in the United States and Silvio Berlusconi in Italy.|$|E
2500|$|Two of {{the groups}} (EPP-ED and IND/DEM) were split. EPP-ED are split on Euroscepticism: the EPP {{subgroup}} ( [...] ) were centre-right Europhiles, whereas the ED subgroup ( [...] ) were right-wing <b>Eurosceptics.</b>|$|R

5|$|The party gained over 7% in four constituencies. Much media {{attention}} {{was focused on}} the seat of Putney, where Goldsmith had stood as the Referendum candidate against incumbent Conservative MP David Mellor; Goldsmith secured 3.5% of the local vote and the seat was won by the Labour candidate. Although it failed to win any seats, the party exhibited the strongest performance of a minor party in recent UK political history. Support had been strongest in the south and east of England, in particular in areas with high elderly populations and high rates of agricultural employment. Support for the party was considerably weaker in Inner London, Northern England, and Scotland; it secured only 1.1% of the Scottish vote. This may have reflected greater pro-EU sentiment in Scotland or a perception that the Referendum Party's Euroscepticism was a form of English nationalism rather than British nationalism. The Referendum Party had proved more electorally successful than its <b>Eurosceptic</b> rival, UKIP, which averaged 1.2% of the vote in the 194 constituencies that it contested.|$|E
5|$|At the 2016 EU {{membership}} referendum, {{all three}} Northern England regions voted to leave, as did all English regions outside London. The largest Northern Remain vote was 60.4% in Manchester; the largest Leave vote was 69.9% in North East Lincolnshire. In total, the Leave {{vote in the}} Northern England regions was 55.9% – {{higher than in the}} Southern England regions and the other Home Nations, but lower than in the Midlands or the East of England. The <b>Eurosceptic</b> UK Independence Party (UKIP) positioned themselves as the main challenger to Labour in Northern constituencies, and came second in many at the 2015 general election. UKIP originally struggled in the region due to vote splitting with the far-right British National Party (BNP), who exploited racial tensions {{in the wake of the}} 2001 Bradford riots and other riots in Northern towns. In 2006, 40% of BNP voters lived in Northern England and both BNP MEPs elected at the 2009 European elections came from Northern constituencies. After 2013, BNP support in the region collapsed as most voters swung to UKIP. The Northern UKIP vote in turn collapsed following the EU referendum, with most UKIP voters returning to their former allegiances.|$|E
5|$|By 1980 all {{apart from}} the United Kingdom, Canada and Ireland had {{effectively}} completed their programs. In the United Kingdom the breakdown of voluntary metrication in the mid-1970s coincided with the United Kingdom's obligations {{as part of the}} EEC to adopt the metric system, resulting in legislation to force metrication in certain areas and the <b>Eurosceptic</b> movement adopting an anti-metrication stance and the United Kingdom seeking a number of derogations from the relevant EEC directives. Once the metrication of most consumer goods was completed in 2000, aspects of British life, especially in government, commerce and industry used SI. Although imperial units are widely encountered in unregulated areas such as the press and everyday speech, SI or units approved for use alongside SI are used in most areas where units of measure are regulated. High-profile exceptions include the sale of draught beer, the sale of milk in returnable containers, and United Kingdom road signs. Irish road signs (road distances and speeds) were converted to metric units during {{the first decade of the}} 21st century; otherwise, the situation in Ireland is similar to that in the United Kingdom.|$|E
