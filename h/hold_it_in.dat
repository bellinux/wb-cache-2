5|$|Decius revives {{the office}} of Censor; the Senate acclaims Valerian as worthy to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> a decree dated 27 October 251. The decree is brought to Decius (on {{campaign}} against the Goths) and he summons Valerian to bestow the honour. The revival of the censorship is fictitious, and Decius {{had been dead for}} several months by the date stated.|$|E
5|$|At the French right flank, General Ferino {{attempted}} {{to push the}} Austrians back, first with a cannonade, followed by an attack through the woods {{on both sides of}} the road between Asch and Stockach. Two columns made two attacks, both of which were repulsed; finally, Ferino added his third column to the assault, which resulted in the Austrian reformation of the line, cannons at the center firing a heavy cannonade. Ferino could not respond because he had run out of artillery ammunition. The French fixed bayonets and charged the village of Wahlwies, successfully taking it, but they were unable to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the night, and subsequently fell back.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his failure}} to defeat Liu Kang in the Mortal Kombat tournament, the evil Shang Tsung begs his master Shao Kahn, supreme ruler of Outworld and the {{surrounding}} kingdoms, to spare his life. He tells Shao Kahn that if they <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Outworld the invitation for the next Mortal Kombat cannot be turned down, and the Earthrealm warriors must attend. Kahn agrees to this plan and also restores Shang Tsung's youth. He then extends the invitation to the thunder god and Earthrealm's protector, Raiden, who gathers his warriors and takes them into Outworld. The new tournament is much more dangerous, as Shao Kahn has the home field advantage, and an Outworld victory {{will allow him to}} subdue Earthrealm.|$|E

5|$|Until 1928, the Indian River Inlet was {{a natural}} {{waterway}} that shifted {{up and down a}} two-mile (3.2km) stretch of the coast. Dredging kept the inlet open in its current location between 1928 and 1937, and in 1938 the United States Army Corps of Engineers built jetties that <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. With the inlet in a fixed place, it became possible after 1928 to build a bridge to span it, and the completion of the Ocean Highway in 1933 prompted Delaware to build a span to connect the northern and southern segments of the highway.|$|E
5|$|By mid-May it {{was clear}} that he would not make the Derby and he was removed from the race on the 23 May. Orme's trainer John Porter and Williams, the {{veterinary}} surgeon, remained convinced that he had been poisoned and was not just suffering from bad teeth. A reward of £1,000 was even offered for information that would lead to the conviction of the guilty party. The poisoning was investigated by George Lewis, a solicitor, who concluded that the horse had been poisoned. He stated that the horse was fine on the morning of the 21 April, but a few hours later his tongue was so inflamed he could not <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> his mouth; something so sudden, Lewis argued, could not have been caused by a decaying tooth. He suggested that the poison may have in fact been attempted to be administered by some ball being put down his throat, but due to the struggles of the horse, it burst in his mouth, blistering his tongue. The Derby was won by Sir Hugo, but many believed that Orme would have won easily had he made the race.|$|E
5|$|Jack Russells {{are first}} and {{foremost}} a working terrier. Originally bred to bolt foxes from their dens during hunts, they are used on numerous ground-dwelling quarry such as groundhog, badger, and red and grey fox. The working JRT is required to locate quarry in the earth, and then either bolt it or <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place until they are dug to. To accomplish this, the dog will not bark but will expect attention to the quarry continuously. Because the preservation of this working ability is of highest importance to most registered JRTCA/JRTCGB breeders, Jack Russells tend to be extremely intelligent, athletic, fearless, and vocal dogs. It is not uncommon for these dogs to become moody or destructive if not properly stimulated and exercised, as they have a tendency to bore easily and will often create their own fun when left alone to entertain themselves.|$|E

5|$|Prior to the First Battle of Ruweisat Ridge, which {{commenced}} on 14–15 July, Inglis {{failed to}} adjust his artillery support following concerns raised by Kippenberger and Jim Burrows, the commanders of the brigades {{involved in the}} planned advance on the defended ridge. Instead, he chose to rely on assurances from his corps commander, Lieutenant General William Gott, that British armour would provide any necessary assistance. This {{proved to be a}} mistake; although the brigades manage to seize the ridge, they were unable to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the face of stronger than expected counterattacks, and the expected armour support never fully eventuated. Afterwards, while Inglis was critical of the conduct of the brigades and laid primary blame for the failure on them and the lack of armour, he overlooked the influence of his own role as divisional commander on the outcome of the battle. An attack mounted a few days later by 6th Brigade was a further failure and highlighted Inglis' failings as a divisional commander by not ensuring adequate support from his corps commander.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is closely {{associated}} with humans. They {{are believed to have}} become associated with humans around 10,000 years ago. Subspecies P. d. bactrianus is least associated with humans and considered to be evolutionarily closer to the ancestral noncommensal populations. Usually, it is regarded as a pest, since it consumes agricultural products and spreads disease to humans and their domestic animals. Even birdwatchers often <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> little regard because of its molestation of other birds. In most of the world, the house sparrow is not protected by law. Attempts to control house sparrows include the trapping, poisoning, or shooting of adults; the destruction of their nests and eggs; or less directly, blocking nest holes and scaring off sparrows with noise, glue, or porcupine wire. However, the house sparrow can be beneficial to humans, as well, especially by eating insect pests, and attempts at the large-scale control of the house sparrow have failed.|$|E
25|$|In Spinoza's view, since God's {{power of}} {{activity}} is infinite, any affection {{which increases the}} organism's power of activity leads to greater perfection. Affects are transitional states or modes {{in that they are}} vital forces by which the organism strives to act against other forces which act on it and continually resist it or <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> check.|$|E

25|$|Another technology, {{which was}} designed, proven mathematically, peer-reviewed, and patented, but is, as of May 2015, unbuilt, is magnetodynamic {{suspension}} (MDS). It uses the attractive magnetic {{force of a}} permanent magnet array near a steel track to lift the train and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. Other technologies such as repulsive permanent magnets and superconducting magnets have seen some research.|$|E
25|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Stenogastrinae, L. vechti secrete a type of gelatinous substance (which is produced by the Dufour’s gland) from their abdomens, which they use {{to care for the}} offspring and to lay their eggs. The females collect the pap with their front legs and then <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> their mouths while they lay eggs, and pap collection is performed before and after each egg is laid.|$|E
25|$|While hunting boar or bears, the Englische Dogge was a catch dog used {{after the}} other hunting dogs to seize the bear or boar and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place until the huntsman was able to kill it. When the hunting customs changed, {{particularly}} because {{of the use of}} firearms, many of the involved dog types disappeared. The Englische Dogge became rare, and was kept only as a dog of hobby or luxury.|$|E

25|$|Hyacinth macaws (Anodorhynchus hyacinthinus) {{have been}} {{repeatedly}} observed to use tools when breaking open nuts, for example, {{pieces of wood}} {{being used as a}} wedge. Several birds have wrapped a piece of leaf around a nut to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. This behaviour is also shown by palm cockatoos (Probosciger aterrimus). It seems that the hyacinth macaw has an innate tendency to use tools during manipulation of nuts, as naïve juveniles tried out a variety of objects in combination with nuts.|$|E
25|$|Many women, such as {{beauty pageant}} {{participants}} and transgender people, create cleavage by using tape underneath and across their breast, bending forward, tightly pulling {{them together and}} up. Types of tape used include surgical micropore tape and athletic tape. Some also use a strip of moleskin under the breasts with tape at the ends to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. Use of the wrong techniques or tape with too strong an adhesive can cause injuries such as rashes, blisters and skin being torn off.|$|E
25|$|The {{internal}} frame backpack consists of strips of either metal or plastic that mold to one's back {{to provide a}} good fit, sometimes with additional metal stays to reinforce the frame. Usually a complex series of straps works with the frame to distribute the weight and <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. The close fitting of the back section to the wearer's back allows the pack to be closely attached to the body, and gives a predictable movement of the load. The {{internal frame}} backpack was invented in 1967 by Greg Lowe, the founder of Lowepro.|$|E

25|$|A cricket cap {{is a type}} of soft cap, {{often made}} from felt, that is a {{traditional}} form of headwear for players of the game of cricket, regardless of age or gender. It is usually a tight-fitting skullcap, usually made of six or eight sections, with a small crescent shaped brim that points downwards over the brow to provide shade for the eyes. It is often, but not always, elasticised at the rear to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place upon the wearer's head. Sometimes, rather than tight-fitting, the cricket cap comes in a baggy variety, that is always kept in place by elastic.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the liquor controversy growing in the province, there was another testing of citizens' sentiment on an issue. The government decided to hold a plebiscite among egg producers {{on whether or not}} to establish a compulsory egg marketing board. That plebiscite was originally to be held in June 1957, but Leonard Halmrast, the Minister of Agriculture, decided to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> conjunction with the liquor plebiscite so that the sentiment of Egg producers could be tested {{at the same time as}} voters for the liquor plebiscite, to save costs. That decision later led to controversy when numerous producers were missed after the plan was defeated in a close vote.|$|E
25|$|The Sec-dependent {{system is}} divided into three {{pathways}}. TAAs are one of those pathways and also go by the name type Vc secretion pathway. The mechanism is split into two. First, the protein must move across the inner membrane or, in other words, translocate, in a Sec-dependent manner via the periplasm. The signal peptide on the N-terminus acts as a temporary tether to <b>hold</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> place. Next, it must move to the outer membrane. The trimerisation aids translocation, and no translocation would occur without its beta-barrel membrane anchor. The type V secretion system is described as non-fimbrious, meaning that the bacterial cells do not use long physical appendages named pili to attach to one another.|$|E
