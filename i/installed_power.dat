Funding would be from a mix of private and state capital. The ceremony was attended by U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and the Moroccan king. The project will involve five solar power generation sites across Morocco and will produce 2,000 megawatts of electricity by 2020.

25|$|BP Solar begun {{constructing}} a new solar photovoltaic cell manufacturing plant at its European headquarters in Tres Cantos, Madrid. For phase {{one of the}} Madrid expansion, BP Solar aimed to expand its annual cell capacity from 55 MW to around 300 MW. Construction of this facility was underway, with the first manufacturing line expected to be fully operational in 2009. The new cell lines would use innovative screen-printing technology. By fully automating wafer handling, the manufacturing lines {{would be able to}} handle the very thinnest of wafers available and ensure the highest quality. Thin wafers are of particular importance since there has been a silicon shortage in recent years. However, after the new national law limiting <b>installed</b> <b>power</b> by year, in April 2009 BP Solar closed its factories.|$|E
25|$|The 10,000-ton treaty cruisers {{were the}} first type of {{warships}} built to internationally agreed restrictions. These restrictions posed new engineering challenges and forced compromises upon designers in how to extract the best balance of speed, armament and protection. The United States Navy adopted a design with triple-gun turrets, allowing the hull to be shortened thus saving weight that could be put into protection. This approach, however, was {{at the expense of}} requiring increased <b>installed</b> <b>power,</b> as the speed of a ship {{is a function of the}} ratio of length to beam. The Royal Navy had a requirement for a vessel for colonial trade route defence, which required a good cruising range and speed and independent fighting power. This determined the need for a long hull and the use of four twin-gun turrets, with any remaining displacement invested in protection.|$|E
