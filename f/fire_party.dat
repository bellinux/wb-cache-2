2500|$|The 1980s saw the {{development}} of post-hardcore, which took the hardcore style in a more complex and dynamic direction, {{with a focus on}} singing rather than screaming. The post-hardcore style first took shape in Chicago, with bands such as Big Black, The Effigies and Naked Raygun, while later developed in Washington, DC within the community of bands on Ian MacKaye's Dischord Records with bands such as Fugazi, The Nation of Ulysses, and Jawbox. The style has extended until the late 2000s. The mid-80s Washington, D.C. post-hardcore scene would also see the birth of emo. Guy Picciotto formed Rites of Spring in 1984, breaking free of hardcore's self-imposed boundaries in favor of melodic guitars, varied rhythms, and deeply personal, impassioned lyrics dealing with nostalgia, romantic bitterness, and poetic desperation. Other D.C. bands such as Gray Matter, Beefeater, <b>Fire</b> <b>Party,</b> Dag Nasty, also became connected to this movement. The style was dubbed [...] "emo", [...] "emo-core", or [...] "post-harDCore" [...] (in reference to one of the names given to the Washington, D.C. hardcore scene).|$|E

5000|$|The {{mission of}} the <b>Firing</b> <b>Party</b> element is to render three volleys of rifle fire at the gravesite to honor the {{deceased}} during funeral services. It is commonly thought that as there are seven members on the party (the NCOIC of the <b>firing</b> <b>party</b> is the eighth member and {{is known as the}} [...] "NFP") with each firing three rounds, that this composes a [...] "21-gun salute". However, this is incorrect. 21 rounds just happen to be the number of rounds <b>fired.</b> The <b>firing</b> <b>party's</b> goal is to fire three volleys in perfect unison (these are known as [...] "boomers"). The custom of firing three volleys began as a way of signaling the opposing side that the battlefield dead had been retrieved and that the fighting could resume. Seven members on the <b>firing</b> <b>party</b> is thought to originate from the idea that seven is a lucky number. Three volleys being fired is thought to symbolize the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit of the Christian faith. It was also believed that the sound of the gunfire scared away evil spirits from the gravesite and paved a way for the soul to follow to heaven. As time passed, these volleys became an official military custom that survives to this day.|$|R
