One manufacturer supplies the following information and advice: When kept unopened in a cool, dry location such as a refrigerator at a temperature of about 55 °F (13 °C), the shelf life of cyanoacrylate will be extended from about one year from manufacture to at least 15 months. If the adhesive is to be used within six months, {{it is not necessary to}} refrigerate it. Cyanoacrylates are moisture-sensitive, and moving from a cool to a hot location will create condensation; after removing from the refrigerator, it is best to let the adhesive reach room temperature before opening. After opening, it should be used within 30 days. Open containers should not be refrigerated.

Sampling methods are an important consideration for human microbiome research, yet are not emphasized in many studies. In this study, we demonstrate that the preparation, handling, and storage of human faeces are critical processes that alter the outcomes of downstream DNA-based bacterial community analyses via qPCR. We found that stool subsampling resulted in large variability of gut microbiome data due to different microenvironments harbouring various taxa within an individual stool. However, we reduced intra-sample variability by homogenizing the entire stool sample in liquid nitrogen and subsampling from the resulting crushed powder prior to DNA extraction. We experimentally determined that the bacterial taxa varied with room temperature storage beyond 15 minutes and beyond three days storage in a <b>domestic</b> frost-free <b>freezer.</b> While freeze thawing only {{had an effect on}} bacterial taxa abundance beyond four cycles, the use of samples stored in RNAlater should be avoided as overall DNA yields were reduced as well as the detection of bacterial taxa.

Mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids represent the most used emulsifiers for gelato but the demand for “clean label” products containing lower amount or no additives or stabilizers is continuously increasing among consumers. In this work, the impact of three phospholipid emulsifiers (soy, milk and rice phospholipids) was evaluated on physicochemical, thermal and flavour characteristics of a basic Italian gelato formulation in comparison to those of mono- and diglycerides of fatty acids, used as control. Control sample showed the highest overrun and unfreezable water values but also the lowest fat destabilization percentages. On the contrary, gelato added with soy phospholipids exhibited the greatest resistance to melt and high fat destabilization ratio being also harder than the others. Sample with rice phospholipids revealed a richer volatile profile with herbal and green notes. The lowest performances were displayed from gelato where milk phospholipids were added as emulsifier as this sample showed higher mix viscosity, green colour notes, lower overrun, hardness and stickiness values. During a 4 -week storage in a <b>domestic</b> <b>freezer,</b> all samples hardened and became more yellow, showing a decrease of volatiles except for samples with rice phospholipids added.

In currently available domestic appliances this matching is realized either by on/off or variable frequency control of the hermetic compressor, leading to a repetitive and transient change of the system state. On the other hand, if the runtimes of the compressor are longer because cooling capacity demand is high (e. g. pull down cycles, initial operation), steady state operating conditions might be reached. The cycling transients cause losses in system efficiency thus they should be reduced or avoided.

50|$|An ice spike is an ice formation, {{often in}} the shape of an {{inverted}} icicle, that projects upwards from the surface of a body of frozen water. Ice spikes created by natural processes on the surface of small bodies of frozen water have been reported for many decades, although their occurrence is quite rare. A mechanism for their formation, now known as the Bally - Dorsey model, was proposed in the early 20th century but this was not tested in the laboratory for many years. In recent years a number of photographs of natural ice spikes have appeared on the Internet as well as methods of producing them artificially by freezing distilled water in <b>domestic</b> refrigerators or <b>freezers.</b> This has allowed a small number of scientists to test the hypothesis in a laboratory setting and, although the experiments appear to confirm the validity of the Bally - Dorsey model, they have raised further questions about how natural ice spikes form, and more work remains to be done before the phenomenon is fully understood. Natural ice spikes can grow into shapes other than a classic spike shape, and have been variously reported as ice candles, ice towers or ice vases as there is no standard nomenclature for these other forms.

40|$|The {{substantial}} {{penetration of}} wind power introduces increased flexibility requirements {{on the power}} system and puts increased pressure on the instantaneous reserve levels required. Instantaneous reserves are a security product that ensures that electricity demand can continue to be met {{in the event of}} unplanned generation or transmission interruptions. This reserve must be available to respond very quickly to generation-demand variability. While this is an integral component of the power system, providing instantaneous reserve increases the production cost of power. More calls from energy researchers and stakeholders ask for loads to play an increasingly important role in balancing the short timescale fluctuations in generated wind power. The {{purpose of this study is}} to assess the current level of demand responsiveness among <b>domestic</b> refrigerators, <b>freezers,</b> and water heaters and their potential to contribute towards instantaneous reserve and balance the fluctuation of wind. Refrigerators, freezers, and water heaters can generally store energy due to their thermal mass. Interrupting these domestic loads for short time by employing direct load control strategies makes it possible to control these appliances by turning them on or off before their reach their maximum or minimum temperatures or by slightly modifying their temperature set point. Using this strategy helps to ensure that the overall satisfaction of consumers should not be affected. This study first modelled the load profiles of the participated residential appliances and statistically assessed the potential of controlling these residential loads using direct load control strategies to contribute towards instantaneous reserves to mitigate and balance the fluctuation of wind power in the years: 2014, 2020 and 2030. In the second section, it demonstrated the capabilities of the assessed residential responsive loads within Wellington Region network to compensate for and balance the fluctuation of wind power generated from the West Wind Farm in seven selected days in 2013 - 2014 as a showcase. Such technology can enable a power system operator to remove the burden of both providing instantaneous reserve from conventional sources, and instead maintain such capacity from available residential demand response.
