5000|$|Agriculture in Bình Phước is {{dominated}} by perennial crops, mainly cashew nuts, rubber, coffee, and pepper. 4333 of the 4458 farms in 2007 were perennial crop farms. Production of cereals is much less significant and accounts only for {{a small part of}} agricultural area and output. 34,200 tons of rice and 19.7 tons of maize were harvested in 2007, accounting for only 0.1 and 0.5 per cent of the national output. Sweet potatoes and cassava are also grown in Bình Phước. The most important cash crop is cashew nuts. 156,377 tons of cashew nuts were harvested in 2007, accounting for 51.8 per cent of the national output. This is a significant increase from 110,000 tons in 2006 and just 19,000 tons in 2000. Cashew nuts are grown mostly in the east and south of the province, roughly along (north and west of) National Road 14. Cashew nuts are an important export product for Bình Phước as well as Vietnam in <b>general.</b> <b>Exports</b> in 2010 are expected to reach 1 billion USD, while there are also increasing imports of raw cashew nuts because processing capacity by now significantly exceeds the quantity grown in Vietnam ...|$|E

30|$|With the {{prevalence}} of processing trade, any measurement based on aggregate results, combining processing exports and other production, could highly overstate China’s economic benefits. Developing a framework to separate the production of Chinese processing exports from <b>general</b> <b>exports</b> so that the total domestic value added (short as DVA) from exports can be measured more accurately is therefore critical. Lau et al. (2006) developed a non-competitive input–output table that captures the Chinese processing trade (known as the DPN table). It differentiates input structures concerning production for domestic use, processing exports, and normal exports, facilitating the study of China’s exported DVA. This methodology was subsequently adopted, directly or indirectly and with variations, by other researchers working on similar and related topics (Koopman et al. 2008; Dean et al. 2011; Chen et al. 2012; Duan et al. 2012; Mu and Yang 2014).|$|E
