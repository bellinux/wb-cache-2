Formerly, male special constables in English and Welsh forces did not wear helmets while on foot patrol but wore patrol caps instead, but in most forces they now do wear helmets. Some forces also issue special constables with a different hat badge from that of their regular counterparts although this is now extremely rare.|$|E
25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a floating element between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually <b>just</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E
2500|$|Sometimes when a game {{nears the}} end, it will {{decompose}} into several smaller games {{that do not}} interact, except in that each player's turn allows moving in only one of them. [...] For example, in Go, the board will slowly fill up with pieces until {{there are just a}} few small islands of empty space where a player can move. [...] Each island is like a separate game of Go, played on a very small board. [...] It would be useful if each subgame could be analyzed separately, and then the results combined to give an analysis of the entire game. [...] This doesn't appear to be easy to do. [...] For example, you might have two subgames where whoever moves first wins, but when they are combined into one big game, it's no longer the first player who wins.

2500|$|Around 1450 BCE, the {{beginning}} of LM II, the Mycenaean Greeks must have moved into the palace of Knossos. They were well-established by 1400, if the Linear B tablets can be dated to then. The resulting LM II culture is not a break with the Minoan past. Minoan traditions continue under a new administration. However, the vase forms and designs {{became more and more}} Mycenaean in character with a large variety of decoration. Style names have multiplied and depend to some degree on the author. The names below are {{only a few of the}} most common. Some authors <b>just</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> name [...] "Mycenaean Koine"; that is, the Late Minoan pottery of Crete was to some degree just a variety of widespread Mycenaean forms. The designs are found also on seals and sealings, in frescoes and on other artifacts. Often Late Minoan pottery is not easily placed in subperiods. In addition are imports from the neighboring coasts of the Mediterranean. Ceramic is not the only material used: breccia, calcite, chlorite, schist, dolomite and other colored and patterned stone were carved into pottery forms. Bronze ware appears imitating the ceramic ware.|$|E

30|$|In this article, we do further {{research}} in noncoherent reception noise radar scheme, and the improving point {{is on the}} transmitted signal reconstruction.

In doing so, the reconstruction error is much smaller than that caused by <b>just</b> <b>using</b> <b>the</b> existing initial condition estimation method especially at low SNR.
