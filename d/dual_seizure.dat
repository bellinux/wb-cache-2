40|$|Objective. Review presurgical use of ictal HFO mapping {{to detect}} ictal {{activation}} areas with <b>dual</b> <b>seizure</b> focus {{in both the}} temporal and extratemporal cortex. Methods. Review of consecutive patients admitted to the University of South Alabama Epilepsy Monitoring Unit (SouthCEP) between January 2014 and October 2015, with suspected temporal lobe epilepsy and intracranial electrode recording. Ictal HFO localization was displayed in 3 D reconstructed brain images using the patient’s own coregistered magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and computed tomography (CT) with the implanted electrodes. Results. Four of fifteen patients showed evidence of extratemporal involvement {{at the onset of}} the clinical seizures. Ictal HFO mapping involving both frontal and temporal lobe changed the surgical resection areas in three patients where the initial surgical plan included only the temporal lobe. Resection of the ictal HFO {{at the onset of the}} seizure and the initial propagation region was associated with seizure freedom in all patients; follow-up period ranged from 12 to 25 months. Significance. Extratemporal ictal involvement may not have clinical manifestations and may account for surgical failure in temporal lobe epilepsy. Ictal HFO mapping is useful to define the ictal cortical network and may help detect an extratemporal focus...|$|E
40|$|This {{reporting}} {{shall be}} {{in the form of}} an out-of-service message. Upon receipt of a release message from the calling ISC, the releasing end DCME shall initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s forward connection, and the opposite end DCME shall automatically initiate the release of the unrestricted 64 kbit/s return connection. Upon completion of this process, a positive release acknowledgement message shall be returned to the releasing ISC. Failure to complete the release shall be reported to the releasing ISC using the out-of-service message and the DCME shall put the trunk in a blocked condition. After manual or automatic removal of any failure condition, the DCME shall put the trunk in an idle condition and send a back-in-service message to the ISC. A calling end DCME shall detect a release initiated by the opposite end (non-controlling) ISC by the reception of a disconnect message in the control channel. This abnormal release shall be recognized as a <b>dual</b> <b>seizure</b> situation being resolved between the ISCs. The detecting DCME shall first complete the release normally and immediately attempt to re-establish the released 64 kbit/s unrestricted duplex connection between the DCMEs. 4. 10 Trunk channel idle noise level detection and injection The DCME transmit unit shall measure the trunk channel idle noise level and forward this information to the corresponding DCME receive unit, which shall insert the appropriate idle level noise within the receive output speech channel during silent intervals following disconection of the bearer channel. The idle level noise shall not be inserted on 64 kbit/s unrestricted channels. e T 25 4. 11 Time slot interchange (TSI) The DCME shall include a time slot interchange capability on the trunk side interface so that a given time [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Rasmussen’s {{encephalitis}} is a well-established, albeit rare {{cause of}} medically intractable epilepsy. In {{a small number}} of Rasmussen's cases, a second pathology is identified, which independently can cause medically intractable <b>seizures</b> (<b>dual</b> pathology). This paper documents a case of a 13 -year-old male who presented with medically intractable epilepsy. The patient underwent a series of surgical resections, early on resulting in a diagnosis of focal cortical dysplasia and later yielding a diagnosis of coexistent Rasmussen’s encephalitis, marked by chronic inflammation, microglial nodules, and focal cortical atrophy, combined with focal cortical dysplasia (Palmini et al. type IIA, ILAE type IIA). The literature on dual pathology in the setting of Rasmussen’s encephalitis is reviewed...|$|R
