In this paper, numerical simulations of three high-energy rotor disk fragments impacting on U type <b>protection</b> <b>rings</b> {{are carried out}} using LS-DYNA. <b>Protection</b> <b>rings</b> with the same mass and different groove depths are designed to study {{the influence of the}} groove depth. Simulation results including kinetic energy and impact force variation of single fragment are presented. It shows that the groove depth infects both the axial containment ability of the <b>protection</b> <b>ring</b> and the transfer process of energy. The depth of groove ought to be controlled to an appropriate value to meet both the requirement of axial containment and higher safety factor. Verification test on high-speed spin tester has been conducted and shows that <b>protection</b> <b>ring</b> with appropriate U structure can resist the impact of the disk burst fragments.

The paper particularly focuses on how the system’s hardware, microcode, and software are aimed at meeting Al-level security requirements while maintaining the standard interfaces and applications of the VMS and ULTRIX- 32 operating systems. The VAX Security Kernel supports multiple concurrent virtual machines on a single VAX system, providing isolation and con-trolled sharing of sensitive data. Rigorous engineering standards were applied during development to comply with the assurance requirements for verification and configuration management. The VAX Security Kernel has been developed with a heavy emphasis on performance and system management tools.

A span-oriented spare capacity allocation (SCA) scheme is proposed to satisfy customers' availability requirements in the end-to-end (E 2 E) sense. The novelty {{of the proposed}} SCA scheme is that it meets the E 2 E availability requirements {{despite the lack of}} knowledge of E 2 E bandwidth by employing <b>protection</b> <b>rings</b> covering all links in the network. Different ring selection methods are presented and also compared from the aspect of network redundancy and LP feasibility which provide more flexibility to the design.
