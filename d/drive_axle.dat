25|$|Solaris Urbino 12 Ü buses are {{typically}} used for urban and interurban commuter public transportation services, the model {{made its debut}} at the IAA Nutzfahrzeuge Trade Fair in Hannover in September 2012. Instead of the classic box shaped look, the front and whole look has a bow shape. The mainly used MAN D2066 LUH 48 engine has a capacity of 10.5 dm3 and a maximum power of 265kW (360hp) and which works with the automatic transmission Voith DIWA.5 or ZF EcoLife. The front axle is independently suspended ZF RL 75 EC, and the <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> is ZF AV 132. The number of seats increased to 44, located on the sides. Options include a Webasto Spheros air conditioning system.|$|E
25|$|In 1919, Edinburgh Corporation {{bought their}} first Leyland charabancs, for tour services. The Corporation was {{authorised}} to purchase 30 more buses in early 1920 for £25,000. By {{the middle of}} 1920, the Corporation had around 60 Leyland buses in service or on order. Of these orders, a 33-seat 'Edinburgh type' single-decker bus body with rear door and a separate smoking compartment at the back, mounted on a 4-ton 36-40hp Model O chassis with worm <b>drive</b> <b>axle,</b> was exhibited at trade shows during the year, the Darlington Royal Show in June and the Commercial Motor Show at Kensington Olympia in October. This body type, in which the driver also had his own compartment, was already reportedly well-known and popular by 1921. One reason for the complete enclosure of the driver was to increase protection against the weather, which in Edinburgh could be considerably cold.|$|E

25|$|A {{skid loader}} or {{skid steer loader}} is a small rigid frame, {{engine-powered}} machine with lift arms used to attach {{a wide variety of}} labor-saving tools or attachments. Though sometimes they are equipped with tracks, skid-steer loaders are typically four-wheel drive vehicles that can push material from one location to another, carry material in its bucket, or load material into a truck or trailer. Brothers Louis and Cyrill Keller co-invented the first skid-steer loader, which was based around a three-wheeled loader they developed in 1957 for a turkey farmer near Rothsay, Minnesota. In September 1958, they were hired by the Melroe brothers at Melroe Manufacturing Company in Gwinner, North Dakota, which was later to become Bobcat Company. Using the brothers' design, Melroe introduced the M60 Self-Propelled Loader and, in 1960, Louis added a rear <b>drive</b> <b>axle,</b> resulting in the M400 model, the world's first true skid-steer loader.|$|E
25|$|The torque {{applied to}} each driving wheel {{is the result}} of the engine, transmission, and <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> {{applying}} a twisting force against the resistance of the traction at that roadwheel. In lower gears, and thus at lower speeds, and unless the load is exceptionally high, the drivetrain can supply as much torque as necessary, so the limiting factor becomes the traction under each wheel. It is therefore convenient to define traction as the amount of force that can be transmitted between the tire and the road surface before the wheel starts to slip. If the torque applied to one of the drive wheels exceeds the threshold of traction, then that wheel will spin, and thus provide torque only at the other driven wheel equal to the sliding friction at the slipping wheel. The reduced net traction may still be enough to propel the vehicle slowly.|$|E
500|$|The Volt {{operates}} as a pure battery electric vehicle until its battery capacity drops to a predetermined threshold from full charge. From there its internal combustion engine powers an electric generator to extend the vehicle's range as needed. When the engine is running it may be periodically mechanically linked (by a clutch) to a planetary gear set, and hence the output <b>drive</b> <b>axle,</b> to improve energy efficiency. The Volt's regenerative braking also contributes to the on-board electricity generation. Under the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) cycle, the 2013/15 model year Volt all-electric range is , with a combined electric mode/gasoline-only rating of [...] equivalent (MPG-equivalent).|$|E

50|$|The {{locomotive}} was {{so named}} under the Swiss locomotive and railcar classification system. According to that system, Ge 6/6 denotes a narrow gauge electric locomotive {{with a total}} of six axles, all of which are <b>drive</b> <b>axles,</b> and Ge 4/4 is similarly a narrow gauge electric locomotive, but with only four axles, all of them <b>drive</b> <b>axles.</b> However, and as discussed below, neither of these names has been strictly accurate for this particular locomotive.|$|R

50|$|In {{rear-wheel drive}} cars and trucks, the engine turns a {{driveshaft}} (also called a propellor shaft or tailshaft) which transmits rotational force to a <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> {{at the rear}} of the vehicle. The <b>drive</b> <b>axle</b> may be a live axle, but modern rear wheel drive automobiles generally use a split axle with a differential. In this case, one half-axle or half-shaft connects the differential with the left rear wheel, a second half-shaft does the same with the right rear wheel; thus the two half-axles and the differential constitute the rear axle.|$|E

50|$|Two motors were {{mounted in}} each bogie frame. The motors drove large cogwheels via {{spring-loaded}} sprockets on each side, and the cogwheels drove a jackshaft. The crank pins of the jackshafts drove - via a coupling rod - the crank pins {{of the two}} outer <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> of the bogie. The inner side of this coupling rod contained a pin, which drove the crank pins of the two inner <b>drive</b> <b>axles</b> via a second coupling rod. Because {{of the position of}} the motors, and therefore also the jackshaft, the coupling rods were offset slightly relative to the <b>drive</b> <b>axles.</b> From a maintenance point of view this kind of drive was cheaper than a complex split coupling rod, but during service it was considerably more bumpy. For this reason primarily, the locomotive was not used for high speed operation.|$|R

50|$|The {{foremost}} axle on the {{tandem axle}} is powered. When fully loaded, the K-44 carries approximately 62% {{of the weight}} lying on the tandem axle. The rear, non-driven axle, {{is linked to the}} <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> through a simple sub-assembly consisting of 3.5 in wide and 1500 mm long leaf springs and rocker arms. When the torque delivered to the rear axle is increased, the mechanism automatically shifts vehicle weight away from the non-driven <b>axle</b> to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle,</b> improving traction when most needed. Additionally, more of the weight can be moved to the <b>driven</b> <b>axle</b> manually using an electro hydraulic system. In order to reduce fuel consumption and tyre wear the non-driven rear axle can also be raised completely off the road/surface, if a third load-bearing axle is not needed because the vehicle is running empty: running on just two axles also reduces the K-44's turning circle.|$|R
50|$|<b>Drive</b> <b>axles</b> are MAN {{single tyre}} hub-reduction, {{and with the}} {{exception}} of the heavier tractor units which are full-time all-wheel drive for traction and torque distribution reasons, all models have selectable front <b>axle(s)</b> <b>drive.</b> All <b>axles</b> have cross-axle differential locks and there are longitudinal differential locks in rear (and front on 8×8 and 10x10 chassis) axle combinations and the transfer case. Axle weight ratings are 9000 kg or 11,000 kg for front axles, and 10,000 kg for rear axles with single wheels/tyres.|$|R
