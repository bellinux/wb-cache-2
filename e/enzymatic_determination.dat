40|$|Summary: We {{describe}} {{a simple and}} rapid, but nevertheless precise and accurate method for the <b>enzymatic</b> <b>determination</b> of the main lipid constituents in human bile. Interfering bile pigments, especially bilirubin are eliminated {{by the use of}} aminopropyl bonded phase columns ("Bond-Elut") prior to the enzymatic measure-ment of cholesterol and lecithin. Intra-assay imprecision was between 3. 1 and 4. 9 % CV, while the inter-assay figures were rather higher at 4. 6 to 7. 5 % CV. Recoveries of bile salts, lecithin and cholesterol were between 94 and 103 %. In contrast, the direct <b>enzymatic</b> <b>determination</b> in native bile produces falsely low results: lecithin from 5 to 20 %, cholesterol from 25 to 40 % of the true value. The results of both enzymatic methods correlated well with commonly accepted procedures for phospholipid and cholesterol determination.
