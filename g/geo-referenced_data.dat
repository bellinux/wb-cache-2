40|$|Abstract: <b>Geo-referenced</b> <b>data</b> play an {{increasingly}} important role in many application areas. The result is a growing need for infrastructures that support the access and exchange of such data. Internet-based geodata servers and service-oriented geodata infrastructures focus on the exchange of GIS-type geodata, and require sophisticated server-side functionality. This prevents many small data providers from participating and hampers the exchange of directly- and indirectly <b>geo-referenced</b> <b>data.</b> The integration of peer-to-peer (P 2 P) technology may help to lower the barrier for participation. However, to support data retrieval based on complex spatial queries in such networks, condensed but expressive spatial metadata are needed. The paper outlines a concept for spatial metadata based on qualitative spatial reference models, and their application in P 2 P networks.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Geo-referencing</b> <b>data</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} terrestrial laser scanner data processing steps. It means to collect the separated scans of the object in one scan world coordinate. Geo-referencing, some times called data registration, is important when the scan object, regardless its size, has a significant variation in depth and one scan is not sufficient to describe it geometrically. Methods for data registration have been widely investigated, but practical rules for capturing the data haven't been examined yet. An example, is the distribution of the tie-points which are used in the registration and their position according to the laser scanner position in every two adjacent scans. In order to evaluate the accuracy of the complete model obtained by the scanning process, a lot of measurements in different positions for distance and orientation of the laser scanner have been performed. In this paper the results of the precision achieved using the registration of two adjacent scans are described. Also some practical rules to mange the geometrical distribution of the tie points and generate their optimal location for improving the precision of the final 3 D model are examined...|$|R

The instrument was linked to a differential global positioning system via a hand-held field computer to <b>geo-reference</b> <b>data.</b> Apparent conductivity was converted to salinity using a regression derived from field data, and mapped to illustrate spatial salinity gradients throughout the marshes. Plant communities occurring at the study sites included native low marsh, high marsh, and brackish tidal riverbank marsh, as well as communities dominated by native and non-native common reed, Phragmites australis. Results revealed mean salinity values were significantly different between each of the community categories sampled within the Estuary. Due to management concerns over expansion of Phragmites within the Estuary, we mapped the salinity range for this community and provided graphic and numerical estimates of potential Phragmites habitat based on salinity alone (26 % of the total acreage surveyed). Electromagnetic induction is an efficient tool for rapid reconnaissance of apparent conductivity and salinity gradients in tidal marsh soils that can be superimposed on aerial imagery to estimate suitable habitat for restoration or invasive control based on salinity ranges...|$|R

These levels are calculated from emission and propagation models that are expensive in time. These noise maps are criticized for being distant from the perception of city users.

The aim of this work is to evaluate contemporarely the canopy health and vigour status of vines {{through the use of}} a mobile monitoring system; this, in order to investigate the possibility to realize a pathological diagnosis in vineyards. To achieve this objective optical and analogue devices were tested: a) GreenSeeker RT 100, a commercial optical device calculating NDVI in real time; b) ultrasonic sensors for canopy thickness estimation. A DGPS receiver was employed for <b>geo-reference</b> <b>data</b> collected while travelling in the vineyards.
