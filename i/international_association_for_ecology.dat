Patz also served as Founding President of the <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and Health from 2006-2010, convening diverse scientists and professionals around health crises stemming from global climate and ecological change. In 1997, he organized and led the first briefing on climate change and health to then EPA Administrator Carol Browner on why climate change matters to public safety. Patz has also cochaired the health expert panel of the first U.S. National Assessment on Climate Change, a report mandated by the U.S. Congress. Patz has testified on climate change and health in both houses of Congress, state legislatures, and has given invited presentations to the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). He has served on five scientific committees of the NAS, and on a recent committee of the Presidential Council of Advisors on Science and Technology (PCAST). He has also served on science advisory and FACA committees for several federal agencies. He was invited on two occasions to brief the Dalai Lama on the inequities posed by climate change, following a widely cited peer-reviewed quantitative assessment led by Patz in 2007, comparing carbon dioxide-emitting countries with countries burdened most by climate-sensitive diseases. Also in 2007, the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change was awarded a Nobel Peace Prize, of which Jonathan Patz was a member alongside Al Gore, though Patz name is not on the medal.|$|E

40|$|Closing the {{gap between}} the health and {{well-being}} status of Indigenous people living in remote areas of northern Australia and non-Indigenous Australians has long been a major target of federal health policy. With climate projections suggesting large increases in hot spells in desert regions and more extremes in rainfall {{in other areas of the}} north, direct and indirect impacts resulting from these changes are likely to further entrench this health and well-being disparity. This paper argues that it is time to explicitly draw on Indigenous definitions of health, which directly address the need to connect individual and community health to the health of their country, in order to develop effective climate adaptation and health strategies. We detail how current health policies overlook this 'missing' dimension of Indigenous connection to country, and why that is likely to be detrimental to the health and well-being of people living in remote communities in a climate-changed future. © 2014 <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and Health...|$|E

40|$|The {{parasitic}} zoonoses human cysticercosis (Taenia solium), taeniasis (other Taenia species) and trichinellosis (Trichinella species) are endemic in the Lao People's Democratic Republic (Lao PDR). This {{study was}} designed to quantify the economic burden pig-associated zoonotic disease pose in Lao PDR. In particular, the analysis included estimation of the losses in the pork industry as well as losses due to human illness and lost productivity. A Markov-probability based decision-tree model was chosen to form the basis of the calculations to estimate the economic and public health impacts of taeniasis, trichinellosis and cysticercosis. Two different decision trees were run simultaneously on the model's human cohort. A third decision tree simulated the potential impacts on pig production. The human capital method was used to estimate productivity loss. The results found varied significantly depending on the rate of hospitalisation due to neurocysticerosis. This study is the first systematic estimate of the economic impact of pig-associated zoonotic diseases in Lao PDR that demonstrates the significance of the diseases in that country. © 2013 <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and Health...|$|E
5000|$|By 1980, {{landscape}} ecology was a discrete, established discipline. It {{was marked by}} {{the organization of the}} <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> Landscape <b>Ecology</b> (IALE) in 1982. Landmark book publications defined the scope and goals of the discipline, including Naveh and Lieberman and Forman and Godron. [...] Forman wrote that although study of [...] "the ecology of spatial configuration at the human scale" [...] was barely a decade old, there was strong potential for theory development and application of the conceptual framework. Today, theory and application of {{landscape ecology}} continues to develop through a need for innovative applications in a changing landscape and environment. Landscape ecology relies on advanced technologies such as remote sensing, GIS, and models. There has been associated development of powerful quantitative methods to examine the interactions of patterns and processes. [...] An example would be determining the amount of carbon present in the soil based on landform over a landscape, derived from GIS maps, vegetation types, and rainfall data for a region.|$|R

Proceedings of the twelfth annual IALE (UK) conference, Cirencester, UK, 21 - 24 June 2004. <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> Landscape <b>Ecology</b> (IALE(UK)), pp. 340 - 343. We hypothesised that variation in the chemical characteristics of Scots pine trees will affect the distribution and abundance of insect herbivores in a native forest landscape. Because insects {{play a key role}} in nutrient cycling this could have consequences for forest soil processes and be a driver of heterogeneity in microbial, mycorrhizal, soil invertebrate and plant species diversity with cascading effects through the food chain. Interception funnels were constructed under Scots pine trees of contrasting phytochemistry to assess the composition of material falling from pine crowns. Material was continuously collected for two years and sorted into plant and insect categories. Significant spatial associations were detected during early summer. The distribution of insect herbivores in early summer was related to the concentrations of ?-pinene and two other monoterpenes. However, the overall average distribution of herbivores each year was related to landform, especially altitude, and illustrates the complex terrain of the study site and potential interactions within the community.

40|$|Understanding the {{complexity}} of human–nature interactions {{is central to the}} quest for both human well-being and global sustainability. To build an understanding of these interactions, scientists, planners, resource managers, policy makers, and communities increasingly are collaborating across wide-ranging disciplines and knowledge domains. Scientists and others are generating new integrated knowledge on top of their requisite specialized knowledge to understand complex systems in order to solve pressing environmental and social problems (e. g., Carpenter et al. 2009). One approach to this sort of integration, bringing together detailed knowledge of various disciplines (e. g., social, economic, biological, and geophysical), has become known as the study of Coupled Human and Natural Systems, or CHANS (Liu et al. 2007 a, b). In 2007 a formal standing program in Dynamics of Coupled Natural and Human Systems was created by the U. S. National Science Foundation. Recently, the program supported the launch of an International Network of Research on Coupled Human and Natural Systems (CHANS-Net. org). A major kick-off event of the network was a symposium on Complexity in Human–Nature Interactions across Landscapes, which brought together leading CHANS scientists at the 2009 meeting of the U. S.

40|$|We {{present a}} case for using Global Community Innovation Platforms (GCIPs), an {{approach}} to improve innovation and knowledge exchange in international scientific communities through a common and open online infrastructure. We highlight the value of GCIPs by focusing on recent efforts targeting the ecological sciences, where GCIPs are of high relevance given {{the urgent need for}} interdisciplinary, geographical, and cross-sector collaboration to cope with growing challenges to the environment as well as the scientific community itself. Amidst the emergence of new international institutions, organizations, and meetings, GCIPs provide a stable international infrastructure for rapid and long-term coordination that can be accessed by any individual. This accessibility can be especially important for researchers early in their careers. Recent examples of early-career GCIPs complement an array of existing options for early-career scientists to improve skill sets, increase academic and social impact, and broaden career opportunities. We provide a number of examples of existing early-career initiatives that incorporate elements from the GCIPs approach, and highlight an in-depth case study from the ecological sciences: the International Network of Next-Generation Ecologists (INNGE), initiated in 2010 with support from the <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and 20 member institutions from six continents...|$|E

Attended by 105 persons from 38 countries, this workshop aimed to have a large-group and encompassing discussion about ecohealth as an emerging field, touching on subjects such as actors, processes, structures, standards, and resources. Notes taken were used to conduct a qualitative thematic analysis combined with a semantic network analysis. Commonalities highlighted by these discussions draw a portrait of a field in which human health, complex systems thinking, action, and ecosystem health are considered central issues. The need to reach outside of academia to government and the general public was identified as a shared goal.

40|$|Wildlife immune {{genes are}} subject to natural {{selection}} exerted by pathogens. In contrast, domestic immune genes are largely protected from pathogen selection by veterinary care. Introgression of domestic alleles into the wild could lead to increased disease susceptibility, but observations are scarce due to low introgression rates, low disease prevalence and reduced survival of domestic hybrids. Here we report the first observation of a deleterious effect of domestic introgression on disease prevalence in a free-living large mammal. A fraction of 462 randomly sampled free-living European wild boar (Sus scrofa) was genetically identified as recent wild boar–domestic pig hybrids based on 351 SNP data. Analysis of antibody prevalence against the bacterial pathogen Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae (Mhyo) showed an increased Mhyo prevalence in wild–domestic hybrids. We argue that the most likely mechanism explaining the observed association between domestic hybrid status and Mhyo antibody prevalence would be introgression of deleterious domestic alleles. We hypothesise that large-scale use of antibiotics in the swine breeding sector {{may have played a}} role in shaping the relatively deleterious properties of domestic swine immune genes and that domestic introgression may also lead to increased wildlife disease susceptibility in the case of other species. © 2015 <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and Healt...|$|E

40|$|Hunting and {{butchering}} {{of wildlife}} in Central Africa are known {{risk factors for}} a variety of human diseases, including HIV/AIDS. Due to the high incidence of human exposure to body fluids of non-human primates, the significant prevalence of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) in non-human primates, and hunting/butchering associated cross-species transmission of other retroviruses in Central Africa, it is possible that SIV is actively transmitted to humans from primate species other than mangabeys, chimpanzees, and/or gorillas. We evaluated SIV transmission to humans by screening 2, 436 individuals that hunt and butcher non-human primates, a population in which simian foamy virus and simian T-lymphotropic virus were previously detected. We identified 23 individuals with high seroreactivity to SIV. Nucleic acid sequences of SIV genes could not be detected, suggesting that SIV infection in humans could occur at a lower frequency than infections with other retroviruses, including simian foamy virus and simian T-lymphotropic virus. Additional studies on human populations at risk for non-human primate zoonosis are necessary to determine whether these results are due to viral/host characteristics or are indicative of low SIV prevalence in primate species consumed as bushmeat as compared to other retroviruses in Cameroon. © 2012 <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and Health...|$|E
40|$|The {{impact of}} {{environmental}} change on transmission patterns of waterborne enteric diseases {{is a major}} public health concern. This study concerns the burden and spatial nature of enteric fever, attributable to Salmonella Typhi infection in the Central Division, Republic of Fiji at a sub-catchment scale over 30 -months (2013 – 2015). Quantitative spatial analysis suggested relationships between environmental conditions of sub-catchments and incidence and recurrence of typhoid fever. Average incidence per inhabited sub-catchment for the Central Division was high at 205. 9 / 100, 000, with cases recurring in each calendar year in 26 % of sub-catchments. Although the numbers of cases were highest within dense, urban coastal sub-catchments, the incidence was highest in low-density mountainous rural areas. Significant environmental determinants at this scale suggest increased risk of exposure where sediment yields increase following runoff. The study suggests that populations living on large systems that broaden into meandering mid-reaches and floodplains with alluvial deposition are at a greater risk compared to small populations living near small, erosional, high-energy headwaters and small streams unconnected to large hydrological networks. This study suggests that anthropogenic alteration of land cover and hydrology (particularly via fragmentation of riparian forest and connectivity between road and river networks) facilitates increased transmission of typhoid fever and that environmental transmission of typhoid fever is important in Fiji. © 2016, <b>International</b> <b>Association</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ecology</b> and Health...|$|E
