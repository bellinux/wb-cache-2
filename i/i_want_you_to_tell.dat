2500|$|When he {{appeared}} before the Foreign Affairs Select Committee on 15 July 2003, Kelly appeared to be under severe stress which was probably increased by the televising of the proceedings. He spoke with a voice so soft that the air-conditioning equipment had to be turned off {{even though it was}} one of the hottest days of the year. His evidence to the committee was that he had not said the things Gilligan had reported his source as saying, and members of the committee came to the conclusion that he had not been the source. Some of the questioning was very precise. The Labour MP Andrew MacKinlay, in particular, used a forceful tone in his cross-examination. For example, when asked to simply list the journalists that he met, Kelly declined to answer and requested that such a list be sought from the MoD, which triggered a response: [...] "...This is the high court of Parliament and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> the Committee who you met... You are under an obligation to reply". [...] The Chairman of the Committee (Donald Anderson) underscored the validity of MacKinlay's question telling Kelly: [...] "It is a proper question... If you have met journalists there is nothing sinister in itself about meeting journalists, save in an unauthorised way." [...] Mackinlay offered his opinion that Kelly had been used by Gilligan telling Kelly: [...] "I reckon you are chaff; you have been thrown up to divert our probing. Have you ever felt like a fall-guy? You have been set up, have you not?" ...|$|E

[...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
