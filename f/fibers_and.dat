5|$|Plasticity: The synapses between {{parallel}} <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> Purkinje cells, and the synapses between mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> deep nuclear cells, {{are both}} susceptible to modification of their strength. In a single cerebellar module, input from {{as many as}} a billion parallel fibers converges onto a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells, and the influence of each parallel fiber on those nuclear cells is adjustable. This arrangement gives tremendous flexibility for fine-tuning the relationship between the cerebellar inputs and outputs.|$|E
5|$|Two {{types of}} neuron play {{dominant}} {{roles in the}} cerebellar circuit: Purkinje cells and granule cells. Three types of axons also play dominant roles: mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> climbing fibers (which enter the cerebellum from outside), and parallel fibers (which are the axons of granule cells). There are two main pathways through the cerebellar circuit, originating from mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> climbing fibers, both eventually terminating in the deep cerebellar nuclei.|$|E

30|$|By {{comparing}} the strength capacities of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue of Model III and Model I, {{we can see}} that strength capacities of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous tissue of the former model is 29.88 and 7.82  %, which are greater than those of the latter model, respectively. In other words, assuming the safety factors of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue in Model I are 1, then the safety factors of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue in Model II are 2.83 and 2.89, respectively. Further on, the safety factors of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue in Model III are 3.23 and 3.30, respectively. In the perspective of {{comparing the}} strength capacities of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue of each model, {{it can be seen that}} hollow structure as well as fiber gradient distribution of bamboo are the major reason why bamboo structure has excellent mechanics performance.|$|R

5|$|Although Purkinje <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> {{the bundle}} of His were {{discovered}} {{as early as the}} 19th century, their specific role in the electrical conduction system of the heart remained unknown until Sunao Tawara published his monograph, titled Das Reizleitungssystem des Säugetierherzens, in 1906. Tawara's discovery of the atrioventricular node prompted Arthur Keith and Martin Flack to look for similar structures in the heart, leading to their discovery of the sinoatrial node several months later. These structures form the anatomical basis of the electrocardiogram, whose inventor, Willem Einthoven, was awarded the Nobel Prize in Medicine or Physiology in 1924.|$|E
5|$|Cerebellar granule cells, in {{contrast}} to Purkinje cells, are among the smallest neurons in the brain. They are also easily the most numerous neurons in the brain: In humans, estimates of their total number average around 50 billion, which means that about 3/4 of the brain's neurons are cerebellar granule cells. Their cell bodies are packed into a thick layer {{at the bottom of}} the cerebellar cortex. A granule cell emits only four to five dendrites, each of which ends in an enlargement called a dendritic claw. These enlargements are sites of excitatory input from mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> inhibitory input from Golgi cells.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the physical layer, most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
40|$|Plasma-assisted surface {{treatment}} on thermomechanical pulp (TMP) <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> polypropylene (PP) film was investigated to obtain interfacial adhesion at the wood <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> PP interface. A metal plate between electrodes prevented thermal {{damage to the}} TMP <b>fiber</b> handsheets <b>and</b> PP film. Oxygen-plasma treatment provided better surface activation on the TMP <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> PP film than argon-plasma treatment. When the surfaces of both TMP <b>fiber</b> handsheets <b>and</b> PP film were treated with the oxygen-based plasma, the tensile strength substantially increased. The optimum exposure period for TMP fiber to plasma with ionized oxygen gas was 30 - 90 sec. and resulted in 43 - 80 % increased tensile strength over the untreated samples. AFM topographies showed that oxygen plasma treatment changed the surface tomography and surface roughness of the wood <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> PP. Nodular structures {{were found on the}} flat areas of the wood <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> PP after undergoing oxygen plasma treatment. The size of the nodules increased as treatment time increased. The surface roughness decreased with O 2 plasma treatment as also did the thermal characteristics of the glass transition point (Tg) and crystallinity (X C) from DSC. The RMS roughness and thermal quantities were reduced with 30 seconds of plasma treatment but slightly recovered after 60 seconds of treatment.

5|$|Divergence and convergence: In {{the human}} cerebellum, {{information}} from 200 million mossy fiber inputs is expanded to 40 billion granule cells, whose parallel fiber outputs then converge onto 15 million Purkinje cells. Because {{of the way}} that they are lined up longitudinally, the 1000 or so Purkinje cells belonging to a microzone may receive input from as many as 100 million parallel <b>fibers,</b> <b>and</b> focus their own output down to a group of less than 50 deep nuclear cells. Thus, the cerebellar network receives a modest number of inputs, processes them very extensively through its rigorously structured internal network, and sends out the results via a very limited number of output cells.|$|E
5|$|Modularity: The {{cerebellar}} {{system is}} functionally divided into {{more or less}} independent modules, which probably number in the hundreds to thousands. All modules have a similar internal structure, but different inputs and outputs. A module (a multizonal microcompartment in the terminology of Apps and Garwicz) consists of a small cluster of neurons in the inferior olivary nucleus, a set of long narrow strips of Purkinje cells in the cerebellar cortex (microzones), and a small cluster of neurons {{in one of the}} deep cerebellar nuclei. Different modules share input from mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> parallel fibers, but in other respects they appear to function independently—the output of one module does not appear to significantly influence the activity of other modules.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} fossils of megalodon are its teeth. Diagnostic {{characteristics}} include a triangular shape, robust structure, large size, fine serrations, {{a lack of}} lateral denticles, and a visible V-shaped neck (where the root meets the crown). The tooth met the jaw at a steep angle, similar to the great white shark. The tooth was anchored by connective tissue <b>fibers,</b> <b>and</b> the roughness of the base may have added to mechanical strength. The lingual side of the tooth, the part facing the tongue, was convex; and the labial side, {{the other side of}} the tooth, was slightly convex or flat. The anterior teeth were almost perpendicular to the jaw and symmetrical, whereas the posterior teeth were slanted and asymmetrical.|$|E
30|$|Bamboo fiber volume {{fractions}} decrease {{along the}} radial {{direction from the}} outer to the inner part of a culm wall making bamboo become a typical functionally graded material. Three models composed of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue were built based on different fiber distributions for comparative analysis. Assuming the safety factors of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue in the solid model are 1, then the safety factors of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue in the fiber evenly distributed hollow model are 2.83 and 2.89, respectively; furthermore, the safety factors of <b>fiber</b> <b>and</b> parenchymatous ground tissue in the fiber gradient distributed hollow model are 3.23 and 3.30, respectively.

5|$|The osteoderms of ankylosaurids were thin in {{comparison}} {{to those of other}} ankylosaurs, and appear to have been strengthened by randomly distributed cushions of collagen fibers. These were structurally similar to Sharpey's <b>fibers,</b> <b>and</b> were embedded directly into the bone tissue, a feature unique to ankylosaurids. This would have provided the ankylosaurids with an armor covering which was both lightweight and highly durable, being resistant to breakage and penetration by the teeth of predators. The palpebral bones over the eyes may have provided additional protection for them. Carpenter suggested in 1982 that the heavily vascularized armor may also have had a role in thermoregulation as in modern crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|By 1960, the Cold War raged {{between two}} superpowers: the United States, a {{capitalist}} liberal democracy, and the Soviet Union (USSR), a Marxist–Leninist socialist state {{ruled by the}} Communist Party. Expressing contempt for the U.S., Castro shared the ideological views of the USSR, establishing relations with several Marxist–Leninist states. Meeting with Soviet First Deputy Premier Anastas Mikoyan, Castro agreed to provide the USSR with sugar, fruit, <b>fibers,</b> <b>and</b> hides, in return for crude oil, fertilizers, industrial goods, and a $100 million loan. Cuba's government ordered the country's refineries – then controlled by the U.S. corporations Shell and Esso – to process Soviet oil, but under U.S. pressure, they refused. Castro responded by expropriating and nationalizing the refineries. Retaliating, the U.S. cancelled its import of Cuban sugar, provoking Castro to nationalize most U.S.-owned assets on the island, including banks and sugar mills.|$|E

5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} {{granular}} layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, vestibular nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the granular layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|The deep nuclei of the {{cerebellum}} are {{clusters of}} gray matter lying {{within the white}} matter {{at the core of}} the cerebellum. They are, with the minor exception of the nearby vestibular nuclei, the sole sources of output from the cerebellum. These nuclei receive collateral projections from mossy <b>fibers</b> <b>and</b> climbing fibers as well as inhibitory input from the Purkinje cells of the cerebellar cortex. The four nuclei (dentate, globose, emboliform, and fastigial) each communicate with different parts of the brain and cerebellar cortex. (The globose and the emboliform nuclei are also referred to as combined in the interposed nucleus). The fastigial and interposed nuclei belong to the spinocerebellum. The dentate nucleus, which in mammals is much larger than the others, is formed as a thin, convoluted layer of gray matter, and communicates exclusively with the lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The flocculonodular lobe is the only part of the cerebellar cortex that does not project to the deep nuclei—its output goes to the vestibular nuclei instead.|$|E
5|$|The {{design of}} the First Issue (postage currency) was {{directly}} based on Spinner’s original handmade examples. Some varieties even had perforated stamp-like edge. While not actually legal tender, postage currency could be exchanged for United States Notes in $5 lots and were receivable in payment of all dues to the United States, up to $5. Subsequent issues would no longer include images of stamps and were referred to as Fractional Currency. Despite the July 1862 legislation, postage stamps remained a form of currency until postage currency gained momentum {{in the spring of}} 1863. In 1863, Secretary Chase asked for a new fractional currency that was harder to counterfeit than the postage currency. The new fractional currency notes were different from the 1862 postage currency issues. They were more colorful with printing on the reverse, and several anti-counterfeiting measures were employed: experimental paper, adding surcharges, overprints, blue end paper, silk <b>fibers,</b> <b>and</b> watermarks to name a few. Fractional currency shields which had single sided specimens were sold to banks to provide a standard for comparison for detecting counterfeits. Postage and fractional currency remained in use until 1876, when Congress authorized the minting of fractional silver coins to redeem the outstanding fractional currency.|$|E
