60|$|When we arose {{and lifted}} the flap of the tent we saw a {{peculiar}} sight. The little elevation on which we had pitched our camp {{seemed to be an}} island in a vast sea of white mist, dotted here and there with other islands. On every hand to the far horizon stretched that strange, phantasmal ocean, and a <b>hazy</b> <b>sun</b> looked over the shifting billows. I had never seen a western mist before and I thought it extremely beautiful; but Kate, to whom it was no novelty, was more cumbered with breakfast cares.|$|E
60|$|Came a {{beautiful}} fall day, warm and languid, palpitant with the hush {{of the changing}} season, a California Indian summer day, with <b>hazy</b> <b>sun</b> and wandering wisps of breeze that did not stir the slumber of the air. Filmy purple mists, that were not vapors but fabrics woven of color, hid in the recesses of the hills. San Francisco lay like a blur of smoke upon her heights. The intervening bay was a dull sheen of molten metal, whereon sailing craft lay motionless or drifted with the lazy tide. Far Tamalpais, barely seen in the silver haze, bulked hugely by the Golden Gate, the latter a pale gold pathway under the westering sun. Beyond, the Pacific, dim and vast, was raising on its sky-line tumbled cloud-masses that swept landward, giving warning of the first blustering breath of winter.|$|E
50|$|There is an {{exposure}} indicator {{which can}} be adjusted for different film speeds (ASA 5-100). This dial rotates as shutter speed and aperture are adjusted to indicate proper exposure in conditions of bright sun, <b>hazy</b> <b>sun,</b> cloudy bright, and cloudy dull for dark, average and light subjects.|$|E
60|$|August 31st dawned {{fine and}} cool and pleasant, rather <b>hazy,</b> with warm <b>sun</b> and smooth sea.|$|R
40|$|As I {{watch the}} <b>hazy</b> orange <b>sun</b> {{sink into the}} still blue sea {{overlooking}} Chuuk lagoon, I {{marked the end of}} another seemingly ordinary day in the Federated States of Micronesia. But this October day was special—it marked the beginning of a promising new era in Chuuk’s fight against HIV and AIDS. For the past few months, several proceedings had set into motion a cascade of events that would ultimately (hopefully) benefit and educate the people of Chuuk state...|$|R
30|$|Temporal sensitivities {{pertain to}} {{time of year}} and the time since fire when {{sampling}} occurs. Seasonal timing can impact radiometric quality of data in terms of transmittance, sun angle, {{and the potential for}} enhanced contrast within burn areas. Results typically improve when remote sensing occurs near summer solstice, when illumination is highest, snow effects are minimized, and phenology provides green and productive unburned vegetation that maximally contrasts with fire effects. Remote sensing can degrade during or soon after many fire seasons when incomplete burning, <b>hazy</b> conditions, low <b>sun</b> angles, or plant senescence are more common. In any case, radiometric and seasonal qualities should be selected for optimal discrimination, and multi-temporal datasets should be matched to reliably isolate fire-specific responses from unburned areas. An IA that is delayed to get higher quality data from a particular sensor can ameliorate problems associated with the emergency response RA. An EA, done during the growing season after fire, however, may be the best interval for quality data. Moreover, the lag time enhances detectable qualities of burn severity. Most notable are the first-order effects evident in survivorship and delayed mortality that develop through the growing season after fire. The RA and IA likely miss these ecologically important indicators, resulting in either over- or underestimating severity. Accordingly, EA may provide more valid and complete representation of severity, with broader potential application over the long term.|$|R
