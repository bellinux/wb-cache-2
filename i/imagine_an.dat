500|$|Mendes avoided using close-ups, as he {{believed}} the technique was overused; he also cited Spielberg's advice that he should <b>imagine</b> <b>an</b> audience silhouetted {{at the bottom of}} the camera monitor, to keep in mind that he was shooting for display on a [...] screen. Spielberg—who visited the set a few times—also advised Mendes not to worry about costs if he had a [...] "great idea" [...] toward the end of a long working day. Mendes said, [...] "That happened three or four times, and they are all in the movie." [...] Despite Spielberg's support, DreamWorks and Mendes fought constantly over the schedule and budget, although the studio interfered little with the film's content. Spacey, Bening and Hall worked for significantly less than their usual rates. American Beauty cost DreamWorks $15million to produce, slightly above their projected sum. Mendes was so dissatisfied with his first three days' filming that he obtained permission from DreamWorks to reshoot the scenes. He said, [...] "I started with a wrong scene, actually, a comedy scene. And the actors played it way too big: it was badly shot, my fault, badly composed, my fault, bad costumes, my fault; and everybody was doing what I was asking. It was all my fault." [...] Aware that he was a novice, Mendes drew on the experience of Hall: [...] "I made a very conscious decision early on, if I didn't understand something technically, to say, without embarrassment, 'I don't understand what you're talking about, please explain it.|$|E

Over 100 conservative groups worldwide signed a petition in support for the law, with Larry Jacobs, manager of the World Congress of Families, supporting its aim to [...] "prohibit advocacy aimed at involving minors in a lifestyle that would imperil their physical and moral health." [...] President of Russia Vladimir Putin answered to early objections to the then-proposed bill in April 2013 by stating that [...] "I want everyone to understand that in Russia there are no infringements on sexual minorities' rights. They're people, just like everyone else, and they enjoy full rights and freedoms". He {{went on to say}} that he fully intended to sign the bill because the Russian people demanded it. As he put it, [...] "Can you <b>imagine</b> <b>an</b> organization promoting pedophilia in Russia? I think people in many Russian regions would have started to take up arms.... The same is true for sexual minorities: I can hardly imagine same-sex marriages being allowed in Chechnya. Can you imagine it? It would have resulted in human casualties." [...] Putin also mentioned that he was concerned about Russia's low birth rate, as same-sex relationships do not produce children. In August 2013, Russian Sports Minister Vitaly Mutko also defended the law, equating it to protecting children from content that glorifies alcohol abuse or drug addiction. He also argued that the controversy over the law and its effects was [...] "invented" [...] by the Western media.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{issues of}} Science Fiction Stories in 1953 and 1954 were {{competent}} but unremarkable, with stories by some popular writers, such as Poul Anderson, Algis Budrys, and Philip K. Dick. [...] Once Science Fiction Stories became established in 1955, Future was {{relegated to the}} junior role, and Science Fiction Stories tended to publish the better stories of the two. [...] During the period when Science Fiction Stories was monthly, it carried serialized novels, including de Camp's The Tower of Zanid and Ward Moore and Robert Bradford's Caduceus Wild. [...] It also published [...] "Genius Loci", described by Ashley as one of Thomas N. Scortia's best short stories. [...] Some well-received stories did appear in Future {{towards the end of}} the decade, including [...] "Vulcan's Hammer", an early novella version of Philip K. Dick's novel of the same name; Clifford D. Simak's [...] "Worlds Without End"; and Judith Merril's [...] "Homecalling", reprinted in the 1960s in SF Impulse, whose editor, Kyril Bonfiglioli, commented [...] "I don't believe I have ever read a more successful attempt to <b>imagine</b> <b>an</b> utterly alien way of thought." [...] Lowndes did what he could to provide interesting non-fiction departments: a book review column was started in the early 1950s, and the end of the decade saw a series of science articles written by Isaac Asimov, and critical articles on science fiction history, written by Lowndes himself. [...] R.A. Lafferty's first story appeared in Science Fiction Stories in the January 1960 issue, shortly before the magazine was closed down. [...] The budget for both magazines, never very great, shrank even further towards the end, so that Lowndes had to fill space with reprints and re-use old illustrations to avoid paying for new stories and artwork.|$|E

2500|$|One may imagine {{two such}} cavities, each {{in its own}} {{isolated}} radiative and thermodynamic equilibrium. One may <b>imagine</b> <b>an</b> optical device that allows radiative heat transfer between the two cavities, filtered to pass only a definite band of radiative frequencies. If {{the values of the}} spectral radiances of the radiations in the cavities differ in that frequency band, heat may be expected to pass from the hotter to the colder. One might propose to use such a filtered transfer of heat in such a band to drive a heat engine. If the two bodies are at the same temperature, the second law of thermodynamics does not allow the heat engine to work. It may be inferred that for a temperature common to the two bodies, the values of the spectral radiances in the pass-band must also be common. This must hold for every frequency band. [...] This became clear to Balfour Stewart and later to Kirchhoff. Balfour Stewart found experimentally that of all surfaces, one of lamp-black emitted the greatest amount of thermal radiation for every quality of radiation, judged by various filters.|$|E

[...] Giulini believes, [...] "If melodrama is the ideal unity of the trilogy of words, music, and action, {{it is impossible to}} <b>imagine</b> <b>an</b> artist in whom these three elements were more together than Callas." [...] He recalls that during Callas's performances of La traviata, [...] "reality was onstage. What stood behind me, the audience, auditorium, La Scala itself, seemed artifice. Only that which transpired on stage was truth, life itself." [...] Sir Rudolf Bing expressed similar sentiments:Once one heard and saw Maria Callas—one can't really distinguish it—in a part, {{it was very hard to}} enjoy any other artist, no matter how great, afterwards, because she imbued every part she sang and acted with such incredible personality and life.

2500|$|Other {{literary}} traditions {{imply that}} Chandragupta {{was raised by}} peacock-tamers (...) , which earned him the Maurya epithet. Buddhist and Jain traditions attest {{the connection between the}} Moriya (Maurya) and Mora, or Mayura (Peacock). While Buddhist tradition describes him as the son of the chief of the peacock clan (Moriya kshatriya), Jain tradition refers to him as the maternal grandson of the headman of the village of peacock tamers (Moraposaga). This view suggests a humble background for Chandragupta; the same tradition also describes Nanda as the son of a barber and a courtesan. The pillar of [...] Ashoka in Nandangarh has the figure of a peacock (repeated in many sculptures of Ashoka at Sanchi) on its bottom. According to Turnour, Buddhist tradition also attests a connection between Moriya and Mora (or Mayura, or peacock).

2500|$|The philosopher Karl Popper {{held that}} any {{scientific}} proposition must be falsifiable, {{in other words}} it must at least be possible to <b>imagine</b> <b>an</b> experiment whose outcome would disprove the hypothesis. Initially he thought that Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection (often summarized as [...] "the survival of the fittest") was untestable in this sense, and therefore [...] "almost tautological." [...] Popper later changed his view, concluding that the theory of natural selection is falsifiable and that Darwin's own example of the peacock's tail had disproved one extreme variation of it, that all evolution is driven by natural selection. Although in 1978 Popper wrote that his earlier objection had been specifically {{to the theory of}} natural selection, in lectures and articles from 1949 to 1974 he had stated that [...] "Darwinism" [...] or [...] "Darwin's theory of evolution" [...] was a [...] "metaphysical research programme" [...] because it was not falsifiable. In fact he continued to express dissatisfaction with contemporary statements of the theory of evolution which focused on population genetics, the study of the relative frequencies of alleles (different forms of the same gene). Unfortunately some of the adjustments he proposed resembled Lamarckianism or saltationism, evolutionary theories that were and still are considered obsolete, and evolutionary biologists therefore disregarded his criticisms. In 1981 Popper complained that he had been misinterpreted as saying that [...] "historical sciences" [...] such as paleontology or the history of evolution of life on Earth were not genuine sciences, when in fact he believed they could make falsifiable predictions.|$|E
