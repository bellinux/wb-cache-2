5|$|Gefjon appears {{prominently}} as the allegorical {{mother of}} Norway, Sweden, and Denmark in the forty-page Swedish Romantic poem Gefion, a Poem in Four Cantos by Eleonora Charlotta d'Albedyhll (1770–1835). A fountain depicting Gefjun <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> oxen sons {{to pull her}} plough (The Gefion Fountain, 1908) by Anders Bundgaard stands in Copenhagen, Denmark, {{on the island of}} Zealand, as in the myth. The Gefion family, a family of asteroids, and asteroid 1272 Gefion (discovered in 1931 by Karl Wilhelm Reinmuth) both derive their names from that of the goddess.|$|E
5|$|Mulder—on {{his way to}} England {{investigating}} heart chakra-shaped crop circles—calls Scully {{and asks}} her to meet a contact of his, Colleen Azar (Colleen Flynn), to obtain some information. As Scully speaks to Mulder on her cellphone while <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> car, a woman appears on a crosswalk. Scully brakes hard to avoid hitting the woman. As she does so, she narrowly avoids colliding with a diesel truck. She realizes that, had the woman not stepped in her path, the truck would have killed her. When she later arrives {{at the house of}} Azar, she observes that Scully is going through a personal crisis and tries to offer her guidance, but Scully is dismissive.|$|E
5|$|On 12 November 2012, Gorrostieta Salazar was <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> {{daughter}} {{to school in}} Morelia at around 8:30a.m. when a vehicle ran them off the road. Two armed men descended from their vehicle and forced {{her out of her}} car as onlookers watched. Gorrostieta Salazar pleaded with her abductors to let her daughter go unharmed, and then agreed to go with the kidnappers. The family of the former mayor initially thought it was a ransom kidnapping. After not hearing from Gorrostieta Salazar or her abductors for two days, they notified the police. On 15 November, police identified the body after farm workers from the rural community of San Juan Tararameo in Cuitzeo found the corpse on their way to work.|$|E
50|$|Jamie Giberson, 25, from Hampton, New Brunswick, {{has been}} traumatized by fear after hitting {{an elderly couple}} early in <b>her</b> <b>driving</b> career. <b>Her</b> fear has caused her to fail a driving exam four times, and she often blames <b>her</b> bad <b>driving</b> on <b>her</b> husband and nominator, Eric Giberson. She drives a silver Oldsmobile Intrigue and drove a grey Ford Five Hundred to the rehab centre.|$|R

5|$|She later {{contacted}} Mulder, who {{was back}} to full health at the time, seeking help on a case she suspected had some link {{to the murder of}} Doggett's son. However, as before, she soon returned to her own work. Reyes remained with the New Orleans field office until she was called upon to protect agent Dana Scully in May 2001, <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> out to a remote location in Georgia so that the pregnant Scully might deliver her child out of harm's way. Reyes helped deliver the child, and made a permanent move soon afterwards, becoming Doggett's partner on The X-Files.|$|E
5|$|The {{assumption}} of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline {{of events and}} why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In {{the second half of}} 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood the inevitability of open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would be useless; her {{assumption of}} the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.|$|E
5|$|Three years later, Stone {{followed}} Kelley’s example. In 1843, a deacon {{was expelled}} from Stone's church for his antislavery activities, which included supporting Kelley by hosting her at his home and <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> to lectures that she gave in the vicinity. When the first vote for expulsion was taken, Stone raised {{her hand in his}} defense. The minister discounted her vote, saying that, though {{she was a member of}} the church, she was not a voting member. Like Kelley, she stubbornly raised her hand for each of the remaining five votes.|$|E

5|$|Michèle Mouton {{was born}} 23 June 1951 in Grasse, a {{town on the}} French Riviera known for its perfume industry, close to the {{mountain}} stages famously featured in French rallies. Her parents grew roses and jasmine on their large property. After graduating from high school, Mouton began law studies, but would soon drop out and concentrate on a career in rallying. Although Mouton began <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> father's Citroën 2CV when she was 14 years old, she did not turn her interest to rallying until 1972, when her friend Jean Taibi asked her to practise the Tour de Corse with him. Mouton later co-drove {{for him in the}} 1973 Monte Carlo Rally, the first-ever World Rally Championship (WRC) event. After a few more rallies, Mouton's father suggested a switch to driving if she wanted to continue in rallying, and promised to buy her a car and give her one-year to prove herself. Driving an Alpine-Renault A110, she debuted at the Critérium Féminin Paris-Saint-Raphaël and then tackled the Tour de France Automobile. In the Île de Beauté, a complementary event to the Tour de Corse at the end of 1973, Mouton finished eighth overall.|$|E

25|$|At {{the end of}} {{the summer}} of 1906, salvage efforts were {{suspended}} for the year, with plans to resume them in 1907. However, an inspection of the ship conducted from 1 to 10 October 1906 found that the action of the sea was <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> further ashore and bending and warping her hull so that her seams were beginning to open, her deck planking was coming apart, and her boat davits had collapsed.|$|E
60|$|But {{the train}} shot round the low green hills fringed with the glorious foliage of the maples, the lake sparkled in the afternoon's sun, {{the dome of}} the capitol {{building}} loomed against the sky, and the romance and terror of her entry into the world came back to <b>her,</b> <b>driving</b> out <b>her</b> more morbid emotions. She became again the healthy country girl to whom Madison was a center of art and society and literature.|$|R

On March 24, 2005, Abdul was fined US$900 and given 24 months of informal probation after pleading no contest to misdemeanor hit-and-run driving. She was ordered to pay US$775 for damage to the other car.|$|E

25|$|Two days later, {{acting on}} {{information}} {{he had received}} of a large privateer cruising in the Bite or off the Skaw, Wood fell in with a large lugger that mounted 16 guns. After a chase of 14 hours, Hound succeeded in shooting away the lugger's main mast and <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> ashore between Robsnout and Hartshall. The wind was driving a heavy sea on the beach {{with the result that}} it soon dashed the lugger to pieces, and probably cost many of the lugger's crew their lives. Wood was pleased to have destroyed his quarry however, as {{she was one of the}} largest and fastest vessels on the coast and when he encountered her was trailing a British convoy from the Baltic.|$|E

It was alleged that he then drove Christine Eadie to Gosford Bay, Aberlady, and there or elsewhere attacked, stripped and gagged her with her underwear, and tied her wrists, before raping her and then killing her by restricting her breathing. He was further accused of raping and murdering Scott in the same way and <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> to a road near Haddington, and in a field there or elsewhere in Edinburgh and East Lothian attacking her.|$|E
25|$|As Cinderella {{arrives at}} the ball, she tries to make {{her way to the}} prince, but is confronted by Henry. When pressed why she stole his bike and a dagger of his, she admits that she had an ulterior motive for coming to the ball; she plans on killing the prince, as vengeance for ruining her family and <b>driving</b> <b>her</b> father to an early death. Henry tries to talk her out of it and gives her a {{hyacinth}} flower for luck, telling her that he is returning to his own realm at midnight, and that she could start a new life there. Before he can pursue her any further, however, he blacks out and learns that his drink was drugged by Alice, a mysterious woman ordered by Rumpelstiltskin to keep a eye on Henry.
