40|$|This thesis {{examines}} Manawatu tenants' {{awareness and}} knowledge of the Residential Tenancies Act 1986, as well as tenants' attitudes and experiences of renting within the private residential market. It is based upon the responses of five tenants, four housing workers and two government housing officials to questions asked in semi-structured interviews. The Residential Tenancies Act 1986 has been in force for ten years, but are tenants any the wiser? This is a particularly important question, given changes in housing policies and the state's withdrawal from the direct provision of housing assistance as it looks to the private rental market to pick up the slack. The findings reported in this study indicate: that tenants, in the main, conducted their rental affairs from a position of ignorance; and that those tenants who were uncertain about their rights and obligations were reluctant to seek advice on tenancy matters, or to pursue any formal line of complaint in case they faced eviction. If tenants expect to receive <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> in their relationship with private landlords, they need at the very least to be aware not only of tenancy law, but their rights and obligations therein. Therefore, the dynamics and tensions that exist between tenants' knowledge of the law and their relationship with private landlords, fee-paying letting agencies and state functionaries, form a central part of this thesis...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 15 years, the ‘Europeanisation’ of {{policies}} {{dealing with the}} conditions of entry and residence of third-country nationals {{has led to the}} development of a common EU acquis. Yet questions related to policy consistency, legal certainty and <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> <b>treatment</b> in working and living standards still characterise the EU’s legal framework for cross-border mobility. This book critically explores the extent to which EU legal migration policies and their underlying working notions match the transnational mobility of individuals today. It addresses the main challenges of economic migration policies, both within the EU and in the context of EU cooperation with third countries. Special consideration is given to the compatibility of EU policies with international labour standards along with the fundamental rights and approach to fairness laid down in the EU Treaties. The contributions to this book showcase the various uses and potential of social science and humanities research in assessing, informing and shaping EU migration policies. Leading scholars and experts have brought together the latest knowledge available to reappraise the added value of the EU in this area. Their reflections and findings point to the need to develop a revised set of EU policy priorities in implementing a new generation of legal pathways for migration. [...] Part I.

In this paper, the data are examined with respect to candidates' ethnic background and their country of qualification. Two levels of analysis are possible, based on average 'success' or placement rates, and average scores achieved at each stage of the selection process. The analysis, using one-sided significance tests, suggests that White candidates, and those qualifying in the UK, are more likely to succeed in the selection process. Possible explanations are offered from a more detailed interrogation of the selection criteria. Finally, the implications for the next selection round are discussed in the light of these findings...|$|R
40|$|The European Commission is {{introducing}} new regulations on submission and publication of data in electricity markets (SPDEM) and on wholesale energy market integrity and transparency (REMIT). I discuss issues relevant for undertaking an evaluation such regulations. I argue that, for market performance, {{more information is}} not always better; indeed, more information may undermine market performance by facilitating behaviour that is either not cost efficient or aims at exercising market power or establishing and maintaining collusion. Moreover, ensuring rational economic behaviour and an efficient and competitive market outcome does not require general access to information at a very detailed level or {{with a high degree}} of immediacy. I conclude that to achieve the aims of efficiently functioning wholesale electricity markets, <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> access to data and a coherent and consistent view of the European wholesale electricity market, it does not seem advisable to go quite so far with respect to immediacy and detail as intended by the new regulations...|$|R

40|$|In {{consequential}} real-world applications, {{machine learning}} (ML) based systems {{are expected to}} provide <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> decisions on candidates from groups defined by protected attributes such as gender and race. These expectations are set via policies or regulations governing data usage and decision criteria (sometimes explicitly calling out decisions by automated systems). Often, the data creator, the feature engineer, {{the author of the}} algorithm and the user of the results are different entities, making the task of ensuring fairness in an end-to-end ML pipeline challenging. Manually understanding the policies and ensuring fairness in opaque ML systems is time-consuming and error-prone, thus necessitating an end-to-end system that can: 1) understand policies written in natural language, 2) alert users to policy violations during data usage, and 3) log each activity performed using the data in an immutable storage so that policy compliance or violation can be proven later. We propose such a system to ensure that data owners and users are always in compliance with fairness policies. Comment: Presented at the Data For Good Exchange 201...|$|R

50|$|Reasonable <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> terms (RAND), {{also known}} as <b>fair,</b> reasonable, <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> terms (FRAND), denote a {{voluntary}} licensing commitment that standards organizations often request from the owner of an intellectual property right (usually a patent) that is, or may become, essential to practice a technical standard. Put differently, a F/RAND commitment is a voluntary agreement between the standard-setting organization and the holder of standard-essential patents. U.S. courts, as well as courts in other jurisdictions, have found that, in appropriate circumstances, the implementer of a standard—that is, a firm or entity that uses a standard to render a service or manufacture a product—is an intended third-party beneficiary of the FRAND agreement, and, as such, is entitled to certain rights conferred by that agreement.|$|R
40|$|Having reaped {{some success}} in liberalising telecommunications, {{electricity}} utilities and air transport, the European Commission is now taking market economy-focused steps in the sector of public short-distance and regional passenger transport services. In a current draft regulation, it proposes that licences be granted in a transparent public tender procedure. Through the use of "controlled competition" that encompasses exclusivity rights limited by geography and time, both the profitability and quality of public passenger transport are to be improved, which in turn heightens its attractiveness over private motorised transport and its attendant environmental problems. International precedents have shown that competitive bidding produces the best results when compared to full-scale market liberalisation or state provision of public passenger transport. All countries which have so far tendered transport services have seen cost cuts, improved services and a reduction of public subsidies. In Austria, however, the structural and legal prerequisites to ensure <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> competitive tendering are not yet in place, {{in spite of the}} fact that a structural reform was launched in 1999.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to estimate marginal costs of railway maintenance and renewal for Switzerland. The hypothesis is that marginal costs of railway maintenance (as well as those for operation and renewal) are a function of different independent explanatory vari-ables. Such explanatory variables are output measures like gross-ton-kilometres or the num-ber of trains as well as technical and spatial features of the railway system. This work should provide some of the information needed for the introduction of a "smart charging" system for track access in Switzerland. Smart charging should ensure <b>fair</b> <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> prices for users as well as revenues for future infrastructure investment. It should make time-differentiated charges possible in order to allocate scarce track capacities efficiently as well as allow for rewards to environmentally more efficient vehicles. This shows that it is not a strict marginal cost pricing rule that should be implemented in a modern track charging system. The vision is more complex: The charging system should set the right in-centives, its tariffs should reflect the costs caused and it should ensure the financing of the railway infrastructure.

40|$|The {{family law}} in Australia {{claims to be}} universal, egalitarian, {{progressive}} and just. This characterisation of family law, among other things, allows for constructing the mythical Australian identity and the political claim that those who choose to come to Australia should agree to live by its values including its family law. It leaves no scope for an argument for recognising 'religious' laws. However, the very Act that proclaims a universal and exclusive law for everyone also facilitates huge diversity in the actual arrangements people make under it. The fact that it denies or at least downplays the actual plurality raises the central issue for this paper: the role of legal ideology of universal legal rights in maintaining the hegemony of the dominant social order. The discourse of the recognition of religious personal laws, {{and in particular the}} Sharia law, has to be understood in this context of the wider function of family law as an ideology for maintaining the hegemony of the self-understanding of Australia as a modern, liberal society.

40|$|Abstract: Firms often {{collaborate}} {{to produce}} inter-operability standards so that independently designed products can work together. When this process {{takes place in}} a Standard Setting Organization (SSO), participants are typically required to disclose any intellectual property rights (IP) that would be infringed by a proposed standard, and asked for a commitment to license their essential IP on <b>fair,</b> reasonable <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> terms. This paper describes the IP disclosure process, and provides an overview of a publicly available IP disclosure dataset that the authors have compiled using the archives of thirteen major SSOs. We use these new data to illustrate several major trends in standards development, and to show how “declared essential ” patents differ from a random sample of patents of the same vintage covering similar technology...|$|R
5000|$|Because the IEEE's {{standards}} often incorporate {{technologies that}} are covered {{by one or more}} patent claims, the IEEE-SA has developed and added to its governing bylaws a patent policy to ensure both that the implementers using the standard-essential patented technology in their standard-compliant products have access to that technology and that the patent holders that voluntarily contribute those technologies to the standard receive adequate compensation for the implementers' use. An important part of the IEEE patent policy is the FRAND commitment, which is a voluntary contractual commitment signifying that a patent holder with patented technology that has been adopted into one of the IEEE's standards will accept as adequate compensation a [...] <b>fair,</b> reasonable, <b>and</b> <b>non-discriminatory</b> royalty for third-party use of that technology. Most standard-setting organizations have developed similar patent policies with similar commitments.|$|R
40|$|Although Standard Setting Organizations (SSOs) {{generally}} require patent holders {{to agree}} to license their technologies on Reasonable <b>and</b> <b>Non-Discriminatory</b> (RAND), or <b>Fair</b> Reasonable <b>and</b> <b>Non-Discriminatory</b> (FRAND), terms {{as a condition of}} including their technologies in a standard, SSOs have generally declined to accept responsibility for clarifying the meaning of these commitments. Despite this, a consensus has emerged among most commentators as to how F/RAND royalties should be determined for Standard Essential Patents. According to the consensus view, a F/RAND royalty should be the cost of obtaining a license just before the patented invention is declared essential to compliance with an industry standard, which should, in turn, reflect the value of the invention over its best alternative. However, based upon the way in which F/RAND royalties were determined in a number of recent cases, this article argues that courts generally will not have the information needed to implement the consensus view and that, as a result, greater effort should be taken to have these royalties determined before standards are adopted...|$|R
