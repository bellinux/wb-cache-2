40|$|Two <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> are {{considered}} bioequivalent ‘if their bio-availabilities [...] . {{are similar to}} such a degree that their effects, with respect to both efficacy and safety, will essentially be the same’. 1 The bioequivalence of two <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> is generally demonstrated through a clinical study in healthy volunteers, the so-called bioequivalence study. If bioequivalence is shown for two <b>drug</b> <b>products,</b> therapeutic equivalence of the <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> is implied. Chow and Liu 2 call this assumption, namely that bioequivalence implies therapeutic equivalence, the ‘fundamen-tal bioequivalence assumption’. Most <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> on the market today have been subjected to bioequivalence assessment at various stages in their devel-opment. As is well known, generic <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> require the demonstration of bioequivalence to the relevant innovator prod-uct for regulatory approval. What is perhaps less well know...|$|R
40|$|Background The RxNorm and NDF-RT (National Drug File Reference Terminology) are a {{suite of}} {{terminology}} standards for clinical drugs designated {{for use in the}} US federal government systems for electronic exchange of clinical health information. Analyzing how different <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> described in these terminologies are categorized into drug classes will help in their better organization and classification of pharmaceutical information. Methods Mappings between <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> in RxNorm and NDF-RT drug classes were extracted. Mappings were also extracted between <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> in RxNorm to five high-level NDF-RT categories: Chemical Structure; cellular or subcellular Mechanism of Action; organ-level or system-level Physiologic Effect; Therapeutic Intent; and Pharmacokinetics. Coverage for the mappings and the gaps were evaluated and analyzed algorithmically. Results Approximately 54 % of RxNorm <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> (Semantic Clinical <b>Drugs)</b> were found not to have a correspondence in NDF-RT. Similarly, approximately 45 % of <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> in NDF-RT are missing from RxNorm, most of which can be attributed to differences in dosage, strength, and route form.

500|$|In 1994 Richwood Pharmaceuticals {{acquired}} Rexar {{and began}} promoting Obetrol {{as a treatment}} for ADHD (and later narcolepsy as well), now marketed under the new brand name of Adderall, a contraction of the phrase [...] "A.D.D. for All" [...] intended to convey that [...] "it was meant to be kind of an inclusive thing" [...] for marketing purposes. The FDA cited the company for numerous significant CGMP violations related to Obetrol discovered during routine inspections following the acquisition (including issuing a formal warning letter for the violations), then later issued a second formal warning letter to Richwood Pharmaceuticals specifically due to violations of [...] "the new drug and misbranding provisions of the FD Act". Following extended discussions with Richwood Pharmaceuticals regarding the resolution {{of a large number of}} issues related to the company's numerous violations of FDA regulations, the FDA formally approved the first Obetrol labeling/sNDA revisions in 1996, including a name change to Adderall and a restoration of its status as an approved <b>drug</b> <b>product.</b> In 1997 Richwood Pharmaceuticals was acquired by Shire Pharmaceuticals in a $186 million transaction.|$|E

2500|$|In 1975, the FDA {{said it had}} not {{actually}} given (and never did give) approval to any manufacturer to market DES as a postcoital contraceptive, but would approve that indication for emergency situations such as rape or incest if a manufacturer provided patient labeling and special packaging {{as set out in}} a FDA final rule published in 1975. To discourage off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive, the FDA in 1975 removed DES 25mg tablets from the market and ordered the labeling of lower doses (5mg and lower) of DES still approved for other indications changed to state: [...] "This <b>drug</b> <b>product</b> should not be used as a postcoital contraceptive" [...] in block capital letters on the first line of the physician prescribing information package insert and in a prominent and conspicuous location of the container and carton label. In the 1980s, off-label use of the Yuzpe regimen of certain regular combined oral contraceptive pills superseded off-label use of DES as a postcoital contraceptive.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Clinicians {{have had}} {{concerns}} about particulate matter contamination of injectable <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> since {{the development of}} the earliest intravenous therapeutics. All parenteral products contain particulate matter, and particulate matter contamination still has the potential to cause harm to patients. With tens of millions of doses of injectable <b>drug</b> <b>products</b> administered in the United States each year, it is critical to understand the types and sources of particulate matter that contaminate injectable <b>drug</b> <b>products,</b> the possible effects of injected particulate matter on patients, and the current state of regulations and standards related to particulate matter in injectable <b>drug</b> <b>products.</b> Today, the goal of manufacturers, regulators, and standards-setting organizations should be to continue to minimize the risk of particle-induced sequelae, especially in high-risk patients, without trading unnecessary manufacturing burden for minimal safety gains...|$|R
