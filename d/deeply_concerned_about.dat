5|$|The {{government}} remained <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the Bolshevik threat, and in May 1919 the Winnipeg General Strike broke out, {{creating a}} national crisis which ministers feared {{would lead to}} a revolution. The mounted police were deployed to maintain public order and generate intelligence on the strikers; 245 mounted police were sent into the city, supported by four machine guns mounted on lorries. On June 21, which became known as Bloody Saturday, military veterans marched through the city in support of the strikers; the authorities called in the mounted police to break up the marchers. By the time the police arrived, the protesters had begun to riot and the police carried out two mounted charges. The police then concluded that they were losing control of the situation and fired their revolvers into the crowd, killing one man and injuring others. The marchers fled and the strike collapsed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the key to the centrist Civic Platform’s victory in the 2011 Polish election, the first by an {{incumbent}} governing party in post-communist Poland, was its ability to generate fear about the possible consequences of the right-wing Law and Justice party returning to power. Although many of the Civic Platform’s supporters were disappointed with its slow progress in modernising the country, most voters viewed the party as the better guarantor of stability at a time of crisis and continued to harbour <b>deeply</b> ingrained <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the main opposition party. The election appeared to provide further evidence of the consolidation and stabilisation of the Polish party system around the Civic Platform–Law and Justice divide. However, other factors pointed to the dangers of declaring that the Polish party system was ‘frozen’ around these two political blocs and suggested that it remained vulnerable to further shocks and re-alignments...|$|R

25|$|Smith {{has argued}} that the mutinies were akin to labour strikes and could be considered, at least partly, {{political}} in nature. The soldiers demanded more leave and better food and objected to the use of colonial workers on the home front. They were also <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the welfare of their families. The rather subdued repression, according to Smith, was part of the Pétain policy of appeasement. Concurrently, that policy saved the appearance of absolute authority exercised by the French high command.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{relevant}} topics of Roman and Greek political thought between the 1 st and the 2 nd century CE {{is the problem of}} the princeps’ unlimited power and how it could be restricted institutionally; so the authors were <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned,</b> paradoxically, <b>about</b> limiting what was unlimited by definition. To many of them the metaphor of the sun was the best answer to their question. The course of the sun made the princeps’ space of action as clear as possible: he was both absolute and limited, able to give life or death, essential for all creatures that were indispensable to justify his power. Astronomical space invests the space of politics and the metaphor of the sun with a common political language. In this chapter I focus on the transposition of this idea of space from the metaphorical dimension to the pragmatic field of the princeps’ power as it appears in the To An Uneducated Ruler of Plutarch and in the Third Discourse on Kingship of Dio Chrysostom, in order to highlight analogies and differences, according to their respective political visions...|$|R

60|$|I {{remember}} {{some months}} ago, when this affair was fresh in discourse; a person near allied to SOMEBODY, or (as the hawkers called him) NOBODY, who was thought <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned,</b> went <b>about</b> very diligently among his acquaintance, to shew the bad consequences that might follow from any public resentment to {{the disadvantage of}} his ally Mr. Wood; principally alleging the danger of all employments being disposed of from England. One of these emissaries came to me, and urged the same topic: I answered, naturally, that I {{knew there was no}} office of any kind, which a man from England might not have, if he thought it worth his asking; and that I looked upon all who had the disadvantage of being born here, as only in the condition of leasers and gleaners. Neither could I forbear mentioning the known fable of the countryman, who entreated his ass to fly for fear of being taken by the enemy; but the ass refused to give himself that trouble; and upon a very wise reason, because he could not possibly change his present master for a worse: The enemy could not make him fare harder; beat him more cruelly; nor load him with heavier burthens.|$|R

He campaigned to protect endangered species such as the humpback whale, blue whale, Philippine eagle, the tamaraw (a rare dwarf Philippine buffalo), and was instrumental in establishing protections for the Tasaday people, and various African tribes such as the Maasai. Alongside Laurance S. Rockefeller, Lindbergh helped establish the Haleakalā National Park in Hawaii.|$|E
25|$|Demand in Europe for Chinese goods such as silk, tea, and {{ceramics}} {{could only}} be met if European companies funneled their limited supplies of silver into China. In the late 1700s, the governments of Britain and France were <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the imbalance of trade and the drain of silver. To meet the growing Chinese demand for opium, the British East India Company greatly expanded its production in Bengal. Since China's economy was essentially self-sufficient, the country had little need to import goods or raw materials from the Europeans, so the usual way of payment was through silver. The Daoguang Emperor, concerned both over the outflow of silver and the damage that opium smoking was causing to his subjects, ordered Lin Zexu to end the opium trade. Lin confiscated the stocks of opium without compensation in 1839, leading Britain to send a military expedition the following year.|$|E
25|$|After {{the events}} of the Civil War, anti-British {{sentiment}} was high in the United States. British-built Confederate warships had wreaked havoc on US commerce during the war. Irish-Americans were a large and politically important constituency, particularly in parts of the Northeastern States, and a large number of Irish American regiments had participated in the war. Thus, while <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the Fenians, the US government, led by Secretary of State William H. Seward, generally ignored their efforts: the Fenians were allowed to openly organize and arm themselves, and were even able to recruit in Union Army camps. The Americans were not prepared to risk war with Britain and intervened when the Fenians threatened to endanger American neutrality. The Fenians were a serious threat to Canada, as being veterans of the Union Army they were well-armed. Despite failures, the raids had some impact on Canadian politicians who were then locked in negotiations leading up to the Confederation agreement of 1867.|$|E

Campbell-Bannerman got on well with Labour leaders, and he said in 1903 [...] "we are keenly in sympathy with the representatives of Labour. We have too few of them in the House of Commons". Despite this comment, and his sympathies with many elements of the Labour movement, he was not a socialist.

However, after consultation with local Berliners, he found them <b>deeply</b> wounded and <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> the wall; in many instances it had separated families and represented an intrusion of a police state into daily life. Returning to Washington D.C., Robinson's phrase became controversial with the State Department and other staff members, including Chief of Staff Howard Baker and National Security Advisor Colin Powell. Repeated attempts were made to remove it from the speech, but Reagan overruled them, wishing to communicate not only with West Berliners but with East Germans {{on the other side of}} the wall. Reagan went so far as to say [...] "yes, this wall will fall", and that [...] "As long as this gate is closed, as long as this scar of a wall is permitted to stand, it is not the German question alone that remains open, but the question of freedom for all mankind." ...|$|R

25|$|With {{the major}} {{demographic}} shifts {{occurring in the}} country in terms of the racial-ethnic composition of the population, the FCC has been criticized for ignoring the issue of decreasing racial-ethnic diversity of the media. This includes charges that the FCC has been watering down the limited affirmative action regulations it had on the books, including no longer requiring stations to make public their data on their minority staffing and hiring. In the second half of 2006, groups such as the National Hispanic Media Coalition, the National Latino Media Council, the National Association of Hispanic Journalists, the National Institute for Latino Policy, the League of United Latin American Citizens (LULAC) and others held town hall meetings in California, New York and Texas on media diversity as its effects Latinos and minority communities. They documented widespread and <b>deeply</b> felt community <b>concerns</b> <b>about</b> the negative effects of media concentration and consolidation on racial-ethnic diversity in staffing and programming. At these Latino town hall meetings, the issue of the FCC's lax monitoring of obscene and pornographic material in Spanish-language radio and the lack of racial and national-origin diversity among Latino staff in Spanish-language television were other major themes.|$|R
500|$|Music writers opine that Ride the Lightning {{exhibited}} greater musical maturity, with sonically broader songs than Kill 'Em All, {{which was}} {{noted for its}} one-dimensional sound. This was partially because of bassist Cliff Burton's knowledge of music theory. He showed Hetfield how to augment core notes with complementary counter-melodies and how basic guitar harmony worked, which reflected on the song compositions. Hetfield developed more socially aware lyrics, as well as ominous and semi-philosophical references. Ulrich explained that Metallica opted not to rely strictly on fast tempos as on the previous album, but to explore other musical approaches that sounded powerful and heavy. Grinder magazine's Kevin Fisher summarized the album as [...] "ultimate thrash, destruction and total blur" [...] that {{reminded him of the}} speed and power of Kill 'Em All. Music journalist Martin Popoff observed that Ride the Lightning offered [...] "sophistication and brutality in equal measure" [...] and was seen as something new {{at the time of its}} release. Discussing the album's lyrical content, philosopher William Irwin wrote: [...] "After Kill 'Em All, the rebellion and aggression became much more focused as the enemy became more clearly defined. Metallica was <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> various domains in which the common man was wrongfully yet ingeniously deceived.

He also rejected calls from the High Commissioner of Sri Lanka in Canada to stop all protests in Ottawa. Cannon condemned the LTTE for preventing civilians from leaving areas being attacked and using them as human shields. Bev Oda and the Conservative Party of Canada both condemned the use of LTTE flags, insisting that they symbolize connection with a terrorist organization. David Miller and Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty also condemned the Gardiner Expressway blockade. Liberal Party of Canada leader Michael Ignatieff had made statements on the protests in a few occasions. Ignatieff urged the Harper government to break its silence and take initiative in condemning the violence. He stated {{that there are no}} military solutions to the conflict and that the war must stop under a worldwide initiative and internationally coordinated diplomatic strategy. On 21 April, Ignatieff met with a few Tamil leaders in Ottawa to discuss the humanitarian crisis. On the occasion, he said the following: [...] "I am <b>deeply</b> <b>concerned</b> <b>about</b> escalating violence in Sri Lanka, and the resulting deaths of thousands of civilians.
