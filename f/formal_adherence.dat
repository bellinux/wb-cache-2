The phrase divina misericordia in the preface appears also in St. Augustine’s De civitate Dei, where the reference to divine mercy follows immediately after a passage on barbarian incursions. Marcellus and Augustine are contemporaries, {{and the use of the}} phrase is less a question of influence than of the currency of a shared Christian concept. Elsewhere, passages sometimes cited as evidence of Christianity on closer inspection only display the syncretism of the Hellenistic magico-religious tradition, as Stannard noted. Christ, for instance, is invoked in an herb-gathering incantation, but the ritual makes use of magico-medical practices of pre-Christian antiquity. A Judaeo-Christian reference — nomine domini Iacob, in nomine domini Sabaoth — appears as part of a magic charm that the practitioner is instructed to inscribe on a lamella, or metal leaf. Such “magic words” often include nonsense syllables and more-or-less corrupt phrases from “exotic” languages such as Celtic, Aramaic, Coptic, and Hebrew, and are not indications of <b>formal</b> <b>adherence</b> to a religion.|$|E

The investigation {{was concerned with}} the activities and retention of lower-level adult members in the Scout Association of New Zealand. The demographic, socio-economic and organisational background of members, their attitudes, and the organisational context within which activity occurs were examined {{with reference to the}} relationship of these variables with the satisfaction, commitment and participation of members. Particular attention was given to five organisational variables: size, communication, control, support and effectiveness. Attitudinal variables such as solidarity, ideology, prestige and orientation were also examined. It was found that the organisational variables were most clearly related to differences in satisfaction, commitment and participation. This was described firstly in terms of an association between larger size, better and more frequent communication, and higher levels of control, support, and effectiveness. The latter in turn was related to higher levels of satisfaction, commitment, and participation. Background variables, particularly age, also proved important. This suggested that the life cycle plays a part in voluntary association membership and activity. It was concluded that the main organisational variables are affected by the peripheral structural position of voluntary associations in New Zealand society. The sanctions available to senior officials are few and generally weak, and there is often little pressure to pursue some of the more intangible <b>formal</b> goals. <b>Adherence</b> to official procedures varies, with frequent blockages of control, communication and support. This results in considerable differences in the organisational environment within which members operate. The study was carried out over two years.

40|$|Several intersectoral {{community}} approaches targeting {{childhood obesity}} (IACOs) have been {{launched in the}} Netherlands. Translation of these approaches into practice is however arduous and implementation. We therefore studied the implementation of five IACOs in the Netherlands for one-and-a-half years. IACO implementation was evaluated via an adapted version of the MIDI questionnaire, consisting of 18 theory-based constructs. A response rate of 62 % was obtained. A hierarchical multivariate linear regression model was used to analyse our data; the final regression model predicted 65 % {{of the variance in}} adherence. Higher levels of selfefficacy, being an implementer embedded in community B, and having more than 1 year of experience with IACO implementation were associated with higher degrees of <b>adherence.</b> <b>Formal</b> ratification of implementation by management and being prescribed a higher number of activities were related to lower degrees of adherence. We advise that, when designing implementation strategies, emphasis should be placed on the enhancement of professionals' selfefficacy, limitation of the number of activities prescribed and allocation of sufficient time to get acquainted and experienced with IACO implementation. Longitudinal studies are needed to further evaluate interaction between and change within critical determinants while progressing through the innovation process. © The Author 2016.

Introduction: The CHUMS report 1 raised questions as to whether MDS was the best solution to improve adherence and safety in care homes. Dispensing errors for MDS are greater than for traditional prescriptions but {{there is some evidence that}} the administration of medicines is safer using MDS 2. MDS is now widely dispensed by both community and hospital pharmacies for people living in their own homes. The aim of this study was, therefore, to find out the extent to which community and hospital staff valued MDS in domiciliary settings and also to ascertain the views of patients and carers who use MDS. Method: The study was conducted in the Midlands at a busy teaching hospital pharmacy and in a rural community pharmacy. A qualitative approach was adopted based on a phenomenological epistemological stance designed to understand and portray the ‘lived experiences’ of the participants. Eleven semi-structured interviews were audio recorded and transcribed verbatim. Reading and re-reading the transcripts led to a system of coding resulting in two overarching themes – ‘resources for dispensing’ and ‘value of MDS as an aid to improve adherence’. Participants included four pharmacists (two from the community) and three pharmacy technicians (one from the community), b) one hospital discharge nurse, two patients and one carer. The carer and patients were recruited as a convenience sample via the community pharmacy. Topic guides were used to ensure a standard approach and enabled flexibility in clarifying or probing views. The NHS Research Ethics Service confirmed that ethical approval was not required. Results: ‘Resources for dispensing’: MDS dispensing was considered to be labour intensive by both hospital and community pharmacy staff. It had an impact on other work (e. g. dispensing or medicines use reviews) in the pharmacy due to a) the complexity of dispensing and checking process, b) lack of advance notice of exact prescription (e. g. upon discharge from hospital), c) lack of staff resources and bench space. Good use of skill mix of pharmacy technicians and pharmacists enabled MDS to be managed within a busy environment. ‘Value of MDS as an aid to improve adherence’: some pharmacy staff lacked confidence that patients would benefit from MDS especially if they intentionally did not take their medicines. By contrast, carers of patients expressed relief that complex dosing had been ‘sorted’ by the pharmacy. They also considered that a small fee charged by the community pharmacy for dispensing MDS was good value. Discussion Pharmacy staff were not convinced that MDS was always of value and felt that the service increased pressure on other pharmaceutical care commitments. Service users and carers, however, greatly valued MDS because it saved time and reduced the onus upon them to organise the safe administration of medicines. These findings suggest that a <b>formal</b> assessment of <b>adherence</b> needs should be introduced in order to ensure that patients or carers are likely to benefit from MDS. Consideration should also be given as to whether MDS should be funded through the NHS rather than to assume that pharmacies will absorb the cost with or without the assistance of patients.

40|$|Faith {{leadership}} {{as a critical}} dimension {{of the role of}} the Catholic secondary school principal within the Diocese of Lismore is the focus of this study. Set in the context of constant change; ecclesial, social, cultural and educational, this research seeks a more informed and sophisticated understanding of the phenomenon of faith leadership. This topic is problematic within the Diocese of Lismore, with the perception that there is little support for principals in policy or professional development. At the same time there are clear indications of a gap in the research regarding faith leadership especially from the perspective of principals. A comprehensive analysis of key literature in organisational leadership, faith in organisations, values in Christian based organisations and Catholic school leadership, reveals a number of key insights that inform this study. Here faith leadership is shown to be loosely defined with a clear distinction emerging between notions of spirituality and religion. The literature also points to the development of a values-centred congruence between organisational leadership theory and trends in the expression and management of faith and spirituality in the workplace. Thus the literature review establishes faith {{leadership as}} the personal and intrinsic motivation behind human action, expressed in human interaction and centred on core values. This finding raises questions regarding the exact nature of the values underpinning faith leadership and their source and expression in contemporary Catholic secondary schools. Based on these insights three research questions are used in this study: How do principals understand the challenge of faith leadership in Catholic secondary schools in the Diocese of Lismore? How do principals conceptualise faith leadership in Catholic secondary schools in the Diocese of Lismore? How do principals enact the faith leadership role in secondary schools in the Diocese of Lismore? This research study is informed by the theoretical framework of symbolic interactionism. As both a perspective and a method, symbolic interactionism is situated within a pragmatic constructivist paradigm of research. This study employed qualitative research methods, including focus group interviews, record analysis, two individual interviews and a research journal. The findings of this research study suggest that Catholic secondary school principals cannot articulate a common understanding of faith leadership and that they also make a clear distinction between personal spirituality and <b>formal</b> religious <b>adherence</b> in their conceptualisation of this facet of their leadership role. Principals also indicate that faith leadership is rendered more challenging by the reality of tensions surrounding the leadership models operating in Catholic secondary schools and differing perceptions of the role and purpose of these schools from the perspective of principals and the clergy. The data also suggest that little effort had been put into the development of a lay spirituality of faith leadership or into the professional support of principals. It is also apparent through this research study that Catholic secondary school principals, despite an absence of a clear policy or institutional definition of faith leadership, have conceptualised this dimension of their leadership role as gospel based meaning making involving an interrelated construct of ‘having’ (skills and knowledge) ‘doing’ (practical leadership action) and being (personal intrinsic motivation sourced in spiritual values). The utilisation of a discourse of personal spirituality and values, alongside a wider rejection of narrow understandings of Catholicity and Catholic school purpose, suggest that the principals involved in this study have redefined or reimagined (Mellor, 2005) what faith leadership means in contemporary Catholic schools. In addition, the absence of a definitive theological basis for this redefinition and calls for a specific understanding of faith leadership from a lay perspective, suggest that this process is ongoing and unfinished. Despite indications in the research data of tension in the leadership models evident in Catholic secondary schools and the impact of significant external and internal challenges to faith leadership and faith expression within the Diocese of Lismore, this research found principals were positive about this aspect of their role and determined to help the students, parents and staff in their school communities connect with the message of Jesus and the richness of the Catholic faith tradition...|$|R

Methods The methodology combines qualitative and quantitative analysis, in order to highlight and explain discrepancies between goals and results. Results Despite <b>formal</b> <b>adherence</b> to objective efficiency indicators, certain decisions were based on incomplete information and others on considerations outwith initially established criteria. Competition from the private sector was perceived as a threat to public hospitals and the public sector emerged as a major beneficiary of the investment plan.

Conclusions Data-production became almost an end in itself, threatening to undermine the objectives it sought to pursue.

It is essential to avoid systematic biases on all steps from formulating a research proposal to the editorial evaluation of a submitted manuscript. With this in mind, we will attempt to assess the responsibilities of the five key persons: sponsor, clinical investigator, author, editor, and reviewer. Sponsor. To an increasing degree, pharmaceutical companies and other commercial sponsors initiate, support, and define priorities of clinical research. To avoid a systematic bias, a substantial proportion of medical research should be supported through public resources. Clinical investigator. Since patients’ autonomy is rarely complete, <b>formal</b> <b>adherence</b> to ethical codes is not enough. In addition to patients in research who are often offered substantial benefits, attention should be paid also to patients not included in research who may be discriminated. Author. The author is the one who is most often responsible for delayed or missing publication of results of a negative trial. The author should respect rules for co-authorship, be honest presentation of results, and retain an appropriate degree of scientific scepticism. Editor. The editorial work is time-consuming and should be paid. In order to avoid bias against publication of negative trials, we propose a special category of short reports not included in the assessment of impact factor of a journal. Reviewer.

In Mayo Collaborative Services v. Prometheus Laboratories, the Supreme Court has another opportunity not only to clarify the boundaries of patentable subject matter, but to explain what the doctrine of patentable subject matter is all about. This article reviews developments on the issue of patentable subject matter and considers alternative accounts of the work that patentable subject matter doctrine might do for the patent system in the hope of clarifying the application of that doctrine to new technologies with a focus on diagnostic method claims...|$|E
40|$|Efforts {{to reach}} UNAIDS' {{treatment}} and viral suppression targets have {{increased demand for}} viral load (VL) testing and strained existing laboratory networks, affecting turnaround time. Longer VL turnaround times delay both initiation of <b>formal</b> <b>adherence</b> counseling and switches to second-line therapy for persons failing treatment and contribute to poorer health outcomes. We utilized descriptive statistics and logistic regression to analyze VL testing data collected in Malawi between January 2013 and March 2016. The primary outcomes assessed were greater-than-median pretest phase turnaround time (days elapsed from specimen collection to receipt at the laboratory) and greater-than-median test phase turnaround time (days from receipt to testing). The median number of days between specimen collection and testing increased 3 -fold between 2013 (8 days, interquartile range (IQR) = 6 - 16) and 2015 (24, IQR = 13 - 39) (p< 0. 001). Multivariable analysis indicated that the odds of longer pretest phase turnaround time were significantly higher for specimen collection districts without laboratories capable of conducting viral load tests (adjusted odds ratio (aOR) = 5. 16; 95 % confidence interval (CI) = 5. 04 - 5. 27) {{as well as for}} Malawi's Northern and Southern regions. Longer test phase turnaround time was significantly associated with use of dried blood spots instead of plasma (aOR = 2. 30; 95 % CI = 2. 23 - 2. 37) and for certain testing months and testing laboratories. Increased turnaround time for VL testing appeared to be driven in part by categorical factors specific to the phase of turnaround time assessed. Given the implications of longer turnaround time and the global effort to scale up VL testing, addressing these factors via increasing efficiencies, improving quality management systems and generally strengthening the VL spectrum should be considered essential components of controlling the HIV epidemic...|$|E
40|$|Inspired by the 'cultural turn' {{in early}} modern {{international}} relations historythe present contribution aims to reinterpret a classic episode of 18 th Century diplomatic negotiations: {{the series of}} amendments applied to the Peace of Utrecht by the Treaty of the Quadruple Alliance (2 August 1718). Although our basic approach {{is that of a}} legal historian, a correct understanding of rituals and language is quintessential to grasp the workings of diplomacy. A communicative and cultural approach forces the researcher to focus on interaction between partners, rather than on internal decision making. Diplomats and jurists are thus perceived as actors in a common field dominated by symbolic authoritative discourse, autonomous of the writings of scholars (operating at Universities, subjected to censorship or aloof from core political issues) and separated from general political discourse by the veil of secrecy. In the case proposed, two standard phenomena of 18 th Century diplomatic habitus appear: mediation and balance-of-power-rhetoric. In an exceptional period of Franco-British harmony, the two artisans of the 1713 Peace Treaties had to accommodate both Spanish and Habsburg dissatisfaction. The procedure where Britain and France interposed themselves between Vienna and Madrid, both at the Congress of Cambray (1722 - 1725) and at their respective courts (1718 - 1727), conferred tacit legitimacy on the former, deriving from the latter's consent. This legitimacy was exploited to propose political and symbolic accommodation of both Philip V's and Charles VI's aspirations do dominate Italy. However, as the monarchs' consent was structurally subject to change over time and influenced by events, the intervening tandem stagnated, leading directly to the conclusion of the 'Ripperda' Treaty (30 April 1725). At this point, the dissociation of, on the one hand, mediation (a constitutive and future-oriented concept, accompanying legal change) and, on the other hand, France and Britain's roles as guarantors of the Quadruple Alliance (a declaratory and conservative device), became apparent. Where the rupture of diplomatic relations had led to an end of the mediation role, it was evident {{this was not the case}} for the guarantee obligations, which were poised to divide Europe in two camps. The discursive framework, nevertheless, survived to this international tension, as new life was blown into it with the Paris Preliminaries of 1727. The recurrent conflict in interpretation on the Quadruple Alliance's fifth article (the formulation of Charles VI's investiture patents on the "male fiefs of the Empire" Parma-Piacenza and Tuscany) between Spain, the mediators, and the Emperor, is illustrative of the methodological inaptness of a mere formal analysis and incites to apply the above state theoretical insights, while close reading primary sources. The Viennese Chancery twisted the meaning of the Treaty's stipulation to fit its feudal legal conceptions, but, at the same time, never put into question <b>formal</b> <b>adherence</b> to the concepts of balance-of-power (on which its elaboration was grounded) or mediation (which had to accompany its execution). This litteral inconsequent attitude or biased use of the contemporary sui generis legal pluralism cannot be explained otherwise than by distinguishing between, on one side, backward-looking and tradition-based structural horizontal convergence, and, on the other side, prospective unilateral political aspirations emanating from a sole actor, with the normative precedence accorded to the former theatre. I plan to illustrate this by analysing and cross-reading a selection of dispatches from on the investiture patents from the British (British Library, Add. Ms., Townshend Papers, National Archives,State Papers 78 (France)) and the French side (Archives Diplomatiques, Correspondence Politique (Angleterre) /Mémoires et Documents) ...|$|E
