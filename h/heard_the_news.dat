5|$|Jordanian {{authorities}} cautioned {{the relatives}} of al-Balawi against speaking with anyone about the incident. Members of the family said that Jordan security forces had sealed off {{the area in which}} they live, blocking journalists from entering and preventing any family gathering after they <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of al-Balawi's death.|$|E
5|$|On Noumea {{he found}} that hills {{obstructed}} the approaches to Tontouta. Accordingly, he arranged for the Australian workmen there to complete it as an emergency field only and for development of the major airbase {{to be carried out}} at Plaine Des Gaiacs Airfield. Sverdrup was working in Suva when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor.|$|E
5|$|Theon Greyjoy {{returns to}} the Iron Islands and reunites with his sister, Yara. Yara has not forgiven Theon for not coming with her after her costly assault on the Dreadfort, and accuses Theon of {{returning}} to the Iron Islands {{to take advantage of}} their father Balon's death to seize the throne. Theon insists he only <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> after landing and promises that he will instead support Yara's claim at the Kingsmoot.|$|E

5|$|Affairs became further {{complicated}} when, on 2February 1583, {{also known as}} Candlemas, Gebhard married Agnes von Mansfeld-Eisleben in a private house in Rosenthal, outside of Bonn. After the ceremony, the couple processed to the Elector's palace in Bonn, and held a great feast. Unbeknownst to them, while they celebrated their marriage, Frederick, Duke of Saxe-Lauenburg (1554–1586), {{who was also a}} member of the Cathedral Chapter, and his soldiers approached the fortified Kaiserswerth, across the river, and took the castle after a brief fight. When the citizens of Cologne <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> there was a great public exultation.|$|E
5|$|Between June and September 1944, the Wehrmacht {{had lost}} {{more than a million}} men, and it lacked the fuel and armaments needed to operate effectively. On 12 April 1945, Hitler, who had earlier decided to remain in the city against the wishes of his advisers, <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that the American President Franklin D. Roosevelt had died. This briefly raised false hopes in the Führerbunker that there might yet be a falling out among the Allies and that Berlin would be saved at the last moment, as had {{happened}} once before when Berlin was threatened (see the Miracle of the House of Brandenburg).|$|E
5|$|During 6 April, the Ban (governor) of the Drava Banovina, Marko Natlačen {{met with}} representatives of the major Slovene {{political}} parties, and created the National Council of Slovenia, whose aim was to establish a Slovenia independent of Yugoslavia. When he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of fifth column-led revolts within the flanking 4th Army, Trifunović was alarmed, and proposed withdrawal from the border areas, but this was rejected by Petrović. The front along the border with Italy was relatively quiet, with only patrol clashes occurring, some sporadic artillery bombardments of border fortifications, and an unsuccessful raid by the Italians on Mount Blegoš.|$|E
60|$|Then {{he remembered}} that Dumoise had passed through Simla on his way from Bagi; and thus might, possibly, have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> first <b>news</b> of <b>the</b> {{impending}} transfer.|$|R

In all, guests have included at least 12 U.S. presidents: Theodore Roosevelt, William Howard Taft, Woodrow Wilson, Warren Harding, Calvin Coolidge, Herbert Hoover, Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Dwight Eisenhower, John F. Kennedy, Richard Nixon, and Jimmy Carter. During Kennedy's visit he was informed of the Cuban Missile Crisis.|$|E
5|$|Maxwell {{made this}} {{announcement}} on a Saturday when most Football League clubs, including Oxford and Reading, were playing League fixtures. Oxford were playing away at Doncaster Rovers. Jim Smith {{learned of the}} announcement shortly before kick-off at Doncaster's Belle Vue ground from John Ley, a journalist with the Oxford Mail, who had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from another newsman by telephone. Smith immediately called Maxwell to ask {{whether or not he}} would be retained to manage Thames Valley Royals, and was told that he would be.|$|E
5|$|Meyerbeer died in Paris on 2 May 1864. Rossini, who, {{not having}} <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> {{came to his}} {{apartment}} the next day intending to meet him, was shocked and fainted. He was moved to write on the spot a choral tribute (Pleure, pleure, muse sublime!). A special train bore Meyerbeer's body from the Gare du Nord to Berlin on 6 May, where he {{was buried in the}} family vault at the Jewish cemetery in Schönhauser Allee.|$|E

6000|$|Teresa {{answered}} by silently resigning her {{place at the}} bedside. Miss Minerva touched Carmina's hand, and spoke. [...] "Have you <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> good <b>news,</b> dear? Ovid is coming back {{in little more than}} a week." ...|$|R
60|$|As for Mrs. Trevennack, {{when she}} <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> good <b>news,</b> she almost fainted with joy. It might yet be in time. Cleer might be married now before poor Michael broke forth in that {{inevitable}} paroxysm.|$|R
5|$|On April 12, 1865, Booth <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that Robert E. Lee had {{surrendered}} at Appomattox Court House. He told Louis J. Weichmann, {{a friend}} of John Surratt and a boarder at Mary Surratt's house, that he {{was done with the}} stage and that the only play he wanted to present henceforth was Venice Preserv'd. Weichmann did not understand the reference; Venice Preserv'd is about an assassination plot. Booth's scheme to kidnap Lincoln was no longer feasible with the Union Army's capture of Richmond and Lee's surrender, and he changed his goal to assassination.|$|E
5|$|Word of the Gold Rush spread {{slowly at}} first. The {{earliest}} gold-seekers {{were people who}} lived near California or people who <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> from ships on the fastest sailing routes from California. The first large group of Americans to arrive were several thousand Oregonians who came down the Siskiyou Trail. Next came people from the Sandwich Islands, and several thousand Latin Americans, including people from Mexico, from Peru and {{from as far away}} as Chile, both by ship and overland. By the end of 1848, some 6,000 Argonauts had come to California.|$|E
5|$|At 7:30am {{the next}} morning, the Duke of Wellington {{wrote to the}} Mayor of Liverpool from his lodgings in nearby Roby. He had been due to receive the Freedom of the City, but felt that under the {{circumstances}} any kind of celebration would be inappropriate, {{and said that he}} would not be attending any of the planned events in the city that day. The planned parades and ceremonial dinner were cancelled, but in the absence of rapid transit or mass communication there was no way to notify most of the city's population. While some shops had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> and remained shuttered, the ships in Liverpool's docks remained festooned with brightly coloured streamers, and sounded their horns at the time the Duke was expected to be passing.|$|E
60|$|So thought Solomon, {{in spite}} of all his wisdom, because he had not <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> good <b>news</b> of Easter day. And so think many now, who are called wise men and philosophers; because they, alas! for them, will not believe <b>the</b> good <b>news</b> of Easter day.|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Hackit turned pale, {{and hurried}} out to {{question}} the shepherd, who, she found, had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> sad <b>news</b> at an ale-house in the village. Mr. Hackit followed her out and said, 'Thee'dst better have the pony-chaise, and go directly.' ...|$|R
60|$|Now it was Tim's turn {{to gaze at}} Seth reproachfully; and as {{the three}} stood there one and another of their acquaintances, having <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> startling <b>news,</b> came up eagerly curious and {{positive}} that Snip's master had committed some terrible crime.|$|R
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, his detractors used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{circulation}} {{rose from}} 64,000 in 1965 to 67,000 in 1967; the modest 5% increase was exceeded only by Analog {{among the other}} science-fiction magazines, and If won the Hugo Award for best professional SF magazine three years running during this period. However, in March 1969, Robert Guinn sold all four of his magazines, including Galaxy and If, to Arnold Abramson at Universal Publishing and Distribution Corporation (UPD). Pohl was in Rio de Janeiro when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news,</b> and decided to resign his position as editor rather than continue under the new management. He had been considering {{a return to a}} writing career for some time and the change in ownership precipitated his decision to leave.|$|E
5|$|As they left, {{thousands}} of National Guardsmen who had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> were assembling at the Place de Grève. The Marquis de Lafayette, in Paris as their commander-in-chief, discovered to his dismay that his soldiers were largely {{in favor of}} the march and were being egged on by agitators to join in. Even though he was one of France's greatest war heroes, Lafayette could not dissuade his troops and they began threatening to desert. Rather than see them leave as another anarchic mob, the Parisian municipal government told Lafayette to guide their movements; they also instructed him to request that the king return voluntarily to Paris to satisfy the people. Sending a swift horseman forward to warn Versailles, Lafayette contemplated the near mutiny of his men: he was aware that many of them had openly promised to kill him if he did not lead or get out of the way. At four o'clock in the afternoon, fifteen thousand guards with several thousand more civilian latecomers set off for Versailles. Lafayette reluctantly took his place at the head of their column, hoping to protect the king and public order.|$|E
6000|$|He {{had been}} there this evening. [...] "I suppose you have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> Egdon <b>news,</b> Eustacia?" [...] he said, without {{looking up from the}} bottles. [...] "The men have been talking about it at the Woman as if it were of {{national}} importance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "July 31st.--More useful {{information}} for me. I met Midwinter {{again in the}} Park (on the pretext that my reputation might suffer if he called too often at my lodgings), and <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> last <b>news</b> of Armadale since I left the hotel yesterday.|$|R
60|$|When Andy and Chet <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> good <b>news</b> {{they could}} {{scarcely}} contain themselves. Andy danced a jig {{right in the}} hotel room, while both lads had to shake Barwell Dawson by the hand several times, and then they shook hands with Professor Jeffer, too.|$|R
5|$|On October 10, 1973, Agnew {{appeared}} before the federal court in Baltimore, and pled no contest to one felony charge, tax evasion, for the year 1967. Richardson agreed {{that there would be}} no further prosecution of Agnew, and released a 40-page summary of the evidence. Agnew was fined $10,000 and placed on three years' unsupervised probation. At the same time, he submitted a formal letter of resignation to the Secretary of State, Henry Kissinger, and sent a letter to Nixon stating he was resigning in the best interest of the nation. Nixon responded with a letter concurring that the resignation was necessary to avoid a lengthy period of division and uncertainty, and applauding Agnew for his patriotism and dedication to the welfare of the US. House Minority Leader Gerald Ford, who would be Agnew's successor as vice president (and Nixon's as president) recalled that he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> while on the House floor and his first reaction was disbelief, his second sadness.|$|E
5|$|When Kantakouzenos <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> {{he marched}} towards Constantinople, urged by his supporters, who {{expected}} that the death of Apokaukos {{would result in the}} collapse of the regency. Kantakouzenos was more sceptical, and indeed the Patriarch and Empress Anna quickly brought the situation under control. At the same time, Kantakouzenos suffered a series of reverses. These began when John Apokaukos, the nominal governor of Thessalonica, openly announced his allegiance to Kantakouzenos and his plans to surrender the city. He was immediately thwarted by the Zealots who rose up again and killed Apokaukos and the other Kantakouzenist sympathizers in the city. Then John Vatatzes, who had defected to Kantakouzenos the year before, once more switched sides. He attempted to take some of Kantakouzenos' Turkish allies and a few Thracian cities with him, but was murdered soon afterwards. Finally, Kantakouzenos lost the support of his most crucial ally, Umur of Aydin, who left with his army to confront the crusaders in Smyrna. Kantakouzenos replaced him by allying himself with the Emir of Saruhan and, more importantly, Orhan of the rising Ottoman emirate in Bithynia.|$|E
5|$|When the French in New Orleans, {{the colonial}} capital, <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of the massacre, they feared a general Indian {{uprising}} and {{were concerned that}} the Natchez might have conspired with other tribes. They first responded by ordering a massacre of the Chaouacha people, who had {{no relation to the}} Natchez revolt, wiping out their entire village. The French and their Choctaw allies then retaliated against the Natchez villages, capturing hundreds of Natchez and selling them into slavery, although many managed to escape to the north and take refuge among the Chickasaw people. The Natchez waged low-intensity warfare against the French over the following years, but retaliatory expeditions against Natchez refugees among the Chickasaw in 1730 and 1731 forced them to move on and live as refugees among the Creek and Cherokee tribes. By 1736 the Natchez had ceased to exist as an independent people.|$|E
