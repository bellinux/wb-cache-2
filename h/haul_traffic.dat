5000|$|The TRC-97 can be {{connected}} {{to one of three}} mobile antennas, depending on the distance and signal strength needed. One such antenna that can be used with the TRC-97 is the MRT-2 parabolic tropospheric antenna, measuring 15 feet across, which is designed to cover distances of up to 160 km, or 96 miles. Another antenna was a simple feed horn type mounted on a 30 ft pole. The third is a set of 8 foot parabolic dishes on 15' masts (pictured in the photo). These antennas are transported on trailers and have to be manually erected every time they are used, so knowledge of mechanics as well as electronics was needed to erect and maintain that equipment. The system was powered by a 3-cylinder diesel or later by a turbine generator (TG). a typical crew would consist of 2 or three wideband (airforce) technicians and 1 power production (airforce) technician to service the generator set. two units could be used back to back to provide a relay capability for extra long <b>haul</b> <b>traffic.</b> this was usually done at the baseband level without need of any other equipment other than cables. it also could be remotely monitored from up to 2 miles away using the BZ109 test and monitor set. this was accomplished by connecting a single pair of field wires (common military phone line [...] ). th BZ109 would provide remote order wire, some basic measurements and alarm monitoring.|$|E

50|$|Just {{north of}} the Spuyten Duyvil Bridge in the Bronx, the Hudson Line connects with the Oak Point Link, which acts as a {{replacement}} for the decommissioned Port Morris Freight Branch in addition to connecting the Harlem River Intermodal Yard and the Oak Point Yard. The Oak Point Yard, the largest rail yard in New York City, directly serves local industry and the Hunts Point Market and also connects to Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line to Boston, which is used by the Providence and Worcester Railroad to haul crushed stone to Long Island. Freight trains to Long Island move from the yard over the Hell Gate Bridge to the New York and Atlantic yard at Fresh Pond Junction in Queens. As part of the deal to create the Oak Point Link, the Canadian Pacific Railway was granted trackage rights over the Hudson Line and the link, but Canadian Pacific currently allows CSX to <b>haul</b> its <b>traffic</b> in exchange for <b>hauling</b> CSX <b>traffic</b> on another route.|$|R

A system began of improved and unimproved dirt, gravel, oil-gravel surfaced roads, and all weather paved roads and highways. [...] Currently Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation operates over 26000 km of highways and divided highways, over 800 bridges, 12 separate ferries, and one barge. There are also municipal roads which comprise different surfaces. Asphalt concrete pavements comprise almost 9000 km, granular pavement almost 5000 km, non structural or thin membrane surface TMS are close to 7000 km and finally gravel highways make up over 5600 km through the province. TMS roads are maintained by the provincial government department: Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation. In the northern sector, ice roads {{which can only be}} navigated in the winter months comprise another approximately 150 km of travel. Dirt roads also still exist in rural areas and would be maintained by the local resident. All in all Saskatchewan consists of over 250,000 km of roads and highways, the highest amount of road surface compared to any other Canadian province. Roads need to be constructed for the hot summer months, as well as the frigid winter months. Saskatchewan Highways and Transportation seeks to provide an operational transportation system that ensures the safe travel of people and products within a vast province. Crack filling, snow and ice removal, pavement marking, signage, lighting and infrastructure planning. The rural municipalities care for rural roads of which 97 per cent are gravel and the rest asphalt surface.

40|$|Several overlay-based live {{multimedia}} streaming platforms {{have been}} proposed in the recent peer-to-peer streaming literature. In most of the cases, the overlay neighbors are chosen randomly for robustness of the overlay. However, this causes nodes that are distant in terms of proximity in the underlying physical network to become neighbors, and thus data travels unnecessary distances before reaching the destination. For efficiency of bulk data transmission like multimedia streaming, the overlay neighborhood should resemble the proximity in the underlying network. In this paper, we exploit the proximity and redundancy properties of a recently proposed clique-based clustered overlay network, named eQuus, to build efficient as well as robust overlays for multimedia stream dissemination. To combine the efficiency of content pushing over tree structured overlays and the robustness of data-driven mesh overlays, higher capacity stable nodes are organized in tree structure to carry the long <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> and less stable nodes with intermittent presence are organized in localized meshes. The overlay construction and fault-recovery procedures are explained in details. Simulation study demonstrates the good locality properties of the platform. The outage time and control overhead induced by the failure recovery mechanism are minimal {{as demonstrated by the}} analysis. ...|$|E

40|$|Mirroring the {{railroad}} industry of the 1940 's and 1950 's, the trucking industry today {{appears to be}} achieving impressive productivity gains. But {{it is easy to}} confuse true productivity advances in transportation industries with changes in ton-miles per unit of input that are due simply to changes in the composition of traffic, as initially happened with the mid- 20 th century U. S. railroads. This {{is due to the fact}} that transportation has vastly different productivities in different settings - for example, when moving long haul versus short <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> - and the measurement of changes in physical productivity can be overwhelmed by even subtle changes in the traffic mix. After controlling for endogenous changes in the composition of truck traffic, we find that trucking has in fact been a lagging sector of the U. S. economy over the period of our data, 1982 - 1997, with observed productivity changes much more likely due to changes in speed limits and the dimensions of vehicles than adoption of information technology. Our finding of a slow improvement in the physical productivity of trucking inputs does not deny the real improvements in the quality of trucking services (reliability, predictability, speed, order tracking, etc.) that have taken place in the last quarter century. But as in other service industries, true physical productivity improvements in trucking are hard to fin...|$|E
40|$|One {{solution}} to prevent surface fatigue of rails, {{investigated by the}} European project INFRA-STAR, is to coat the surfaces with a material which reduces or eliminates ratchetting. In this investigation, a systematic approach for fatigue design of surface coated rails (called two-material rails) against rolling contact fatigue is presented. It incorporates dynamic train-track interaction simulations, three-dimensional finite element (FE) calculations, shakedown theory, and lab and field trials. The approach was validated against two-dimensional twin-disc tests in laboratory, where surface coated disc specimens were used. Next, heavy <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> field trials were performed using two-material rails. Dynamic train-track interaction simulations, for train traffic situations at the test site, were performed. The results from these simulations were contact load data, which {{were used in the}} fatigue design approach to calculate railhead stresses with a three-dimensional FE model of a piece of rail; 26 load cases were identified as critical with respect to rolling contact fatigue. The stresses from the FE calculations were used to calculate shakedown diagrams for various wheel-rail contact situations at the test site. The shakedown diagrams and calculations are used to illustrate how the improvement in shakedown performance of coated rails varies with the coating thickness, traction coefficient, contact load position, the strength of the coating and substrate materials, and strain hardening of the materials. It is shown that the two-material rails with the correct rail profile can be used to prevent rolling contact fatigue and reduce wear for the current train traffic situation. The results are discussed in the light of observations at the test site...|$|E
40|$|When {{a railway}} is being upgraded, several {{alternative}} investment proposals may be considered. This thesis describes {{the development and}} use of a computerised model to investigate the combined effects of such investments for a less developed country railway. The work focuses on the Botswana line as a case study, but could be, applied to any railway system with similar operating characteristics. It is designed to reflect the priorities of such systems, namely to have the capacity to <b>haul</b> <b>traffic</b> safely and at a low cost; with speed and frequency of service being considered less important. The model also allows for the inefficiencies in operations found in many such railways. The model concentrates on line rather than yards and is in three parts; an operations model; calculations to determine line capacity and general statistics; and a cost model. Each stage of the model involves a development from previous theory on the subject. A train speeds model has been produced which gives results of acceptable accuracy from a simple data input. The train delay model reflects the types of delays found using both low and high, technology trains working methods. The accuracy of both the speed and delay models was tested by running them separately {{from the rest of the}} model, using data from Botswana. Appropriate measures of capacity were developed. Cost equations were produced from information obtained from Botswana and Zimbabwe, and from general literature on the subject. Example runs of the model were performed for illustrative purposes, representing the main investment proposals being considered in Botswana in 1982. It was possible to perform many runs quickly and easily, and thus to obtain much more information than was available in documents produced for Botswana using conventional investment appraisal methods...|$|E

50|$|On his {{penultimate}} 4-6-0 design, Drummond had {{to produce}} a locomotive that was capable of <b>hauling</b> increased <b>traffic</b> at speed. Once again, the possible advantages of the design presented themselves. A similar boiler to the other classes, rated to 175 lbf/in² saturated steam pressure, was utilised, therefore generating the steam needed to power a four-cylinder front end, which powered 6' wheels. The new design was equipped with four sets of Walschaerts valve gear, therefore reducing the mechanical complexity that had plagued his previous designs. This factor also meant a marginally lighter axle-loading. Large, single splashers were also implemented which covered the wheels, though these would prove troublesome in service. The Drummond 'watercart' eight-wheeled tender was utilised for the long journeys on the LSWR mainline. Full-scale construction was undertaken at Nine Elms, with the first of five P14s being outshopped in 1910, {{two years after the}} completion of his G14 design.|$|R
