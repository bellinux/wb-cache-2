For example, in Microsoft Excel one must first select the entire {{data in the}} {{original}} table {{and then go to}} the Insert tab and select [...] "Pivot Table" [...] (or [...] "Pivot Chart"). The user then has the option of either inserting the pivot table into an existing sheet or creating a new sheet to house the pivot table. A pivot table <b>field</b> <b>list</b> is provided to the user which lists all the column headers present in the data. For instance, if a table represents sales data of a company, it might include Date of sale, Sales person, Item sold, Color of item, Units sold, Per unit price, and Total price. This makes the data more readily accessible.|$|E

Training occurred in silos with little attention to teams or other integrative work situations. This workshop will help participants explore and share various strategies to activate and bring together learners from different fields and strengthen their current or future collaboration in patient care. Workshop leaders will briefly share their extensive experience helping multiple institutions move towards inter-professionalism training. The majority of the session participants will work individually or in small groups, exploring key features and instructional strategies useful {{for each of the}} four curriculum phases: Needs Assessment, Planning, Implementation and Program Evaluation. Small groups will present to each other in a summary discussion. The workshop will end with sharing Take-Home Points.

Copyright Notice Copyright (C) The Internet Society (2001). All Rights Reserved. Software that handles electronic mailing list messages (servers and user agents) needs a way to reliably identify messages that belong to a particular mailing list. With the advent of list management headers, it has become even more important to provide a unique identifier for a mailing list regardless of the particular host {{that serves as the}} list processor at any given time. The List-Id header provides a standard location for such an identifier. In addition, a namespace for list identifiers based on fully qualified domain names is described. This namespace is intended to guarantee uniqueness for list owners who require it, while allowing for a less rigorous namespace for experimental and personal use. By including the List-Id <b>field,</b> <b>list</b> servers can make it easier for mail clients to provide automated tools for users to perform list functions. The list identifier can serve as a key to make many automated processing tasks easier, and hence more widely available. 1...|$|E

40|$|A {{basic model}} for the {{dynamics}} of a <b>field</b> <b>list</b> of internationally visible journals is constructed. We study, in function of time, the remainder of an initially choosen set of source journals. The stochastic process {{turns out to be}} a martingale in the limit (mil) or a quasi martingale, according to a. e. or L 1 -boundedness conditions on the controlling parameters of the system. Hence by theorems of Mucci of 1976 and of Bellow of 1978, the process converges under these conditions. We do not know of any other "real life" applications of mils and quasi martingales. The application in the field of information science is remarkable. 'Permanent address The most well-known set of internationally visible journals is the one produced by the Institute for Scientific Information (ISI). This set is called the set of core journals which are used for the citation analysis in their well-known indexes. It is also well-known that this list, although fairly stable, changes from year to year. It suffices to look at the yearly issues of the JCR (Journal Citation Reports). In addition to these yearly changes one might also ask the following basic question: suppose that, at a certain moment in the past, we would have started with a different list than the one adopted by IS 1 at their very start. Would we end up with a list that is more or less the same as theirs or could there be significant differences? We, of course, suppose here that the techniques to delete or add a journal fromlto the list are the same in both cases. Such a technique (and also the above question) was formulated in detail in Rousseau and Spinak (1996) in which one asks for a dynamic study of these problems. These type of questions are also often formulated by research groups that experience certain barriers (e. g...|$|E
