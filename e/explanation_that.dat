5|$|De re militari, a {{treatise}} on Roman military affairs by Vegetius, a late 4th or early 5th-century writer, contains considerable {{information on the}} late army, although its {{focus is on the}} army of the Republic and Principate. However, Vegetius (who wholly lacked military experience) is often unreliable. For example, he stated that the army abandoned armour and helmets in the later 4th century (offering the absurd <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> this equipment was too heavy), which is contradicted by sculptural and artistic evidence. In general, it is not safe to accept a statement from Vegetius unless it is corroborated by other evidence.|$|E

5000|$|The actor-observer {{asymmetry}} {{is often}} {{confused with the}} hypothesis of a self-serving bias in attribution — the claim <b>that</b> people choose <b>explanations</b> in a strategic way {{so as to make}} themselves appear in a more positive light. The important difference between the two hypotheses is that the assumed actor-observer asymmetry is expected to hold for all events and behaviors (whether they are positive or negative) and require a specific comparison between actor explanations and observer explanations. The self-serving bias is often formulated as a complete reversal in actors' and observers' explanation tendencies as a function of positive vs. negative events. In traditional attribution terms, this means that for positive events (e.g., getting an A on an exam), actors will select <b>explanations</b> <b>that</b> refer to their own dispositions, (e.g., [...] "I am smart") whereas observers will select <b>explanations</b> <b>that</b> refer to the actor's situation (e.g., [...] "The test was easy"); however, for negative events (e.g., receiving an F on the exam), actors will select <b>explanations</b> <b>that</b> refer to the situation, (e.g., [...] "The test was impossibly hard") whereas observers will select <b>explanations</b> <b>that</b> refer to the actor's dispositions (e.g., [...] "She is not smart enough").|$|R

5|$|In January 1654, the anti-Polish {{alliance}} of Pereiaslav was concluded between the rebellious Cossack Hetman Bohdan Khmelnytsky and Alexis of Russia, {{who was in}} control of a well-equipped army that was undergoing modernization. In 1654, when Charles X Gustav succeeded his cousin Christina on the Swedish throne, Russian forces were advancing into the unprotected Commonwealth, and {{by focusing on the}} northeast these drew close to the Swedish sphere of interest at the Baltic coast. Seeing the great success on the Russian side, Sweden also decided to intervene, among other reasons using the <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> it was to protect the Protestant population in Poland. Having a close relationships with the Prince of Transylvania, Sweden had intentions to defeat the Catholic Poland. Sweden also drew the rising Cossack Hetmanate to its side that stood in the strong opposition to the Polish government and promised military support if the Cossacks will break with the Russians. Bohdan Khmelnytsky sent an expedition headed by the Kiev colonel to Halychyna which soon turned back due to mutiny within its ranks. The leader of Hetmanate did not participate in actions due to poor health conditions.|$|E
5|$|In January 1858, Stone {{staged a}} highly publicized protest that took the issue of {{taxation}} without representation across the nation. The previous summer she and Blackwell had purchased a house in Orange, New Jersey, and when the first tax bill came, Stone returned it unpaid with the <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> taxing women while denying {{them the right to}} vote was a violation of America’s founding principles. On January 22, 1858, the city auctioned some of her household goods to pay the tax and attendant court costs. The following month, Stone and Blackwell spoke on taxation without representation before two large meetings in Orange, and circulated petitions asking the New Jersey legislature for woman suffrage. Stone’s protest inspired other tax-paying women to action: some followed her example and refused to pay taxes, with one case reaching the Massachusetts Supreme Court in 1863, while others went to the polls to demand their right as tax-payers to vote.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian {{government}} was criticised for {{its approach to}} the battle.

The only <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> many people were willing to accept for the town's fall was {{that it had been}} given up as part of a conspiracy. The commanders of the Croatian forces in Vukovar, Mile Dedaković and Branko Borković, both survived the battle and spoke out publicly against the government's actions. In an apparent attempt to silence them, both men were briefly detained by Croatian military police, and the Croatian government suppressed an issue of the newspaper Slobodni tjednik that published a transcript of a telephone call from Vukovar, in which Dedaković had pleaded with an evasive Tuđman for military assistance. The revelations caused public outrage and reinforced perceptions that the defenders had been betrayed.|$|E

5|$|The Soviet {{monetary}} reform of 1991, {{commonly referred to}} as the Pavlov reform, was the last {{monetary reform}} prior to the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Initiated on 22 January 1991, it was intended to withdraw money from circulation for reallocation to the production of consumer goods, which were in short supply. In a speech, Pavlov stated that the reason for the withdrawal was the government's belief that money was being sent to the Soviet Union from abroad, fuelling inflation. Although ridiculed by the Soviet press at the time, three years later the truth of Pavlov's statement was verified. Mikhail Gorbachev then signed a presidential decree ordering the Soviet financial system to stop accepting and exchanging banknotes issued in 1961. The directive also included 50-rouble and 100-rouble banknotes issued in 1991. On 23 January 1991, the government began restricting monthly bank deposit withdrawals to 500 rubles with the official <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> this was to freeze the income of corrupt officials, capitalists and criminals.|$|E
5|$|This {{particular}} disclosure {{has given}} rise to speculation as to whether, in addition to his efforts to rescue the Hungarian Jews, Wallenberg may have also been pursuing a parallel clandestine mission aimed at politically destabilizing Hungary’s pro-Nazi government on behalf of the OSS. This would also seem to add some credence to the potential <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> it was his association with US intelligence that led to Wallenberg being targeted by Soviet authorities in January 1945. Several other humanitarians who had helped refugees during World War II disappeared behind the Iron Curtain in the period 1949/50, several years after Wallenberg’s disappearance. OSS ties may have been of interest to the Soviets, but are not a complete explanation because some of those detained, i.e. Hermann Field and Herta Field, had not worked for the OSS. All of these humanitarians, however, like Wallenberg, had interacted with a large number of anti-fascist and socialist refugees during the War, and this experience was used in the Stalin regime’s factional politics and show trials.|$|E
5|$|Despite Bricius's earlier appeal, it was {{not until}} Andreas de Moravia's episcopate that Pope Honorius III issued his bull on 10 April 1224 authorising his legates Gilbert de Moravia, Bishop of Caithness, Robert, Abbot of Kinloss and Henry, Dean of Ross to examine the {{suitability}} of transferring the cathedra to Elgin. The Bishop of Caithness and the Dean of Ross performed the translation ceremony on 19 July 1224. On 10 July, Alexander II (Alaxandair mac Uilliam) had agreed to the transference in an edict that referred to his having given the land previously for this purpose. The land grant predated the Papal mandate and there is evidence that building had started in around 1215.Construction of the cathedral was completed after 1242. Chronicler John of Fordun recorded without <b>explanation</b> <b>that</b> in 1270 the cathedral church and the canons' houses had burned down. The cathedral was rebuilt in a larger and grander style to form the greater part of the structure that is now visible, work that is supposed to have been completed by the outbreak of the Wars of Scottish Independence in 1296. Although Edward I of England took an army to Elgin in 1296 and again in 1303, the cathedral was left unscathed, as it was by his grandson Edward III during his assault on Moray in 1336.|$|E
