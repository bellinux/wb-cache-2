5|$|Utilitarian philosopher John Stuart Mill criticised Kant for {{not realizing}} that moral laws are {{justified}} by a moral intuition based on utilitarian principles (that the greatest good for the greatest number ought to be sought). Mill argued that Kant's ethics could not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> certain actions are wrong without appealing to utilitarianism. As basis for morality, Mill believed that his principle of utility has a stronger intuitive grounding than Kant's reliance on reason, and can better <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> certain actions are right or wrong.|$|E
50|$|The {{strengths}} of the polar gating hypothesis are that it <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> conductivity requires a critical thickness of four unit cells of LaAlO3 and that it <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> conductivity requires the SrTiO3 to be TiO2-terminated. The polar gating hypothesis also <b>explains</b> <b>why</b> alloying the LaAlO3 increases the critical thickness for conductivity.|$|R
5000|$|This theory <b>explained</b> <b>why</b> all {{elements}} react {{in the way}} they do and why some formed the compounds they do, while others did not.

5|$|It is also {{possible}} to <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> zero is even without referring to formal definitions.

5|$|The earlier {{theories}} of Newberry, Černý and Grdseloff {{said that the}} Egyptian state under Peribsen suffered from several civil wars, either economic or political in origin.

5|$|Amenemhat {{may have}} died without a male heir, which could <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> he was succeeded by Sobekneferu. However, some egyptologists, such as Aidan Dodson and Kim Ryholt, have {{proposed}} that the first two rulers of the 13th Dynasty, Sobekhotep I and Amenemhat Sonbef, were his sons. Amenenmhat IV may have been Sobeknefru's spouse, but no evidence currently substantiates this hypothesis.|$|E
5|$|Amin {{recruited}} {{his followers}} {{from his own}} ethnic group, the Kakwas, along with South Sudanese. By 1977, these three groups formed 60 percent of the 22 top generals and 75 percent of the cabinet. Similarly, Muslims formed 80 percent and 87.5 percent of these groups {{even though they were}} only 5 percent of the population.

5|$|Attacks may {{be brought}} on by {{physical}} exertion, drinking alcohol, or eating food high in carbohydrates or salt.

Exercise-related attacks tend to occur {{during a period of}} rest immediately after exercise; exercise may therefore be recommended to abort an attack.|$|E
5|$|Dalton also {{believed}} atomic theory could <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> water absorbs different gases in different proportions. For example, {{he found that}} water absorbs carbon dioxide far better than it absorbs nitrogen. Dalton hypothesized {{this was due to}} the differences between the masses and configurations of the gases' respective particles, and carbon dioxide molecules (CO2) are heavier and larger than nitrogen molecules (N2).|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had to be present for pleasure to be felt.|$|E

5|$|Exmoor {{also has}} a henge located near to Parracombe, {{although}} it has been damaged by ploughing. Alongside this, the moor bears a profusion of other Bronze Age monuments, including between 300 and 400 round barrows, standing stones, and linear stone settings. The creation of these different monument types might <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> so few stone circles were apparently created here.|$|E
5|$|Natural lead {{consists}} of four stable isotopes with mass numbers of 204, 206, 207, and 208, and traces of five short-lived radioisotopes. The high number of isotopes is consistent with lead's atomic number being even. Lead has a magic number of protons (82), for which the nuclear shell model accurately predicts an especially stable nucleus. Lead-208 has 126 neutrons, another magic number, which may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> lead-208 is extraordinarily stable.|$|E

This may <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> the 1918 flu had its surprising effect on younger, healthier people, as {{a person with a}} stronger immune system would potentially have a stronger overreaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} costs in <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> products are bundled and specifically focuses on why they are tied; tying is a special case of bundling in which a product is not provided separately from the bundle. We assume that firms are not motivated by the standard price discrimination or foreclosure reasons discussed in the existing literature. With these assumptions, we show that marginal cost savings realized by producers or consumers are sufficient for <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> firms bundle but are neither necessary nor sufficient for <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> firms tie. Product-specific scale economies are necessary for <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> costs drive firms to tie. Firms eliminate a choice desired by some group of consumers to realize these economies and thereby reduce prices overall. Our cost-based approach provides insights into bundling and tying in three markets—decongestants and pain relievers, foreign electrical adapters, and automobiles...|$|R
