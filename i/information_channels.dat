This study conducted a factorial repeated-measures ANOVA to examine the interaction effect between <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> and <b>information</b> source on students' internship information search behavior. Empirical findings indicated a significant interaction effect in students' information use. That is, how information is transmitted (<b>information</b> <b>channel)</b> is more influential than where information is from (information source) is in information use. Also, {{it was found that}} the selection of <b>information</b> <b>channel</b> and source is dependent on the type of internship in query.

2500|$|There were {{different}} types of merchants who operated in the ancient Tamil market, which {{gave rise to a}} wealth-based class distinction among them. Merchants in the lower levels of the hierarchy were of two varieties: the [...] merchants who sold goods that they manufactured themselves and the retailers who sold goods manufactured by others. Itinerant traders were found in both the rural and urban markets, but the retailers were concentrated in the cities. In the rural markets, salt and grain merchants usually produced the goods, transported them and sold them directly to the consumers. Salt merchants, known as umanar, travelled with their families in trains of carts. In the cities, artisans such as the blacksmiths and the oil mongers sold their products directly to the consumers. The bulk of the retailers operated in the textile industry. The textile dealers (aruvai vanigar) bought their products from the weavers (kaarugar) and resold them to the consumers. Merchants selling agricultural produce in the cities were also retailers. At {{the upper end of the}} merchant hierarchy, were the rich merchants who participated in the export trade. There were three classes among them - ippar, kavippar and perunkudi - based on the extent of their wealth; the perunkudi made up the wealthiest class. Foreign merchants, mainly Romans, also did business in the Tamil markets [...] not just in the port cities, but in inland cities such as Madurai, where they exchanged indigenous goods for their offerings. Another category of merchants were the intermediaries or the brokers, who acted as <b>information</b> <b>channels</b> and offered their services mainly to the foreign merchants.|$|E
