In this paper we demonstrate that all pure two-photon and three-photon states have unit degree of quantum polarization. We also show that pure states belonging to groups of discrete symmetry have unit degree of quantum polarization for arbitrary number of photons. For a certain class of two-photon states, we substantiate the possibility of generating the full basis set (three orthogonal states) by using only combinations of the SU(2) generators, i. e., by using geometrical rotations and <b>differential</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shifts.</b> Finally, we generate the whole basis set for pure reflection-symmetrical three-photon states by means of SU(2) generators...|$|R

50|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>phase</b> <b>shift</b> keying (DPSK) is {{a common}} form of phase {{modulation}} that conveys data by changing the phase of the carrier wave.
