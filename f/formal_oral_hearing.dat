It has been suggested that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> will almost be as good as useless if the affected person has no prior knowledge of the case. In Lloyd v.

Giving judgment in the Court of Appeal of England and Wales, Lord Justice Harry Woolf held that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> may not always be the [...] "very pith of the administration of natural justice". It has also been suggested that an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> is only required if issues concerning deprivations of legal rights or legally protected interests arise.|$|R

40|$|The {{principle}} of non-refoulement requires Canada to carry out risk assessments prior to removal of non-citizens from Canada, when they allege the risk of persecution, torture {{or other forms of}} cruel and inhuman treatment at their home country. Thus, to ensure compliance of the {{principle of}} non-refoulement, Canada established the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment ("PRRA") process. My thesis focuses on the procedural set up of the PRRA process, which makes it difficult for an applicant to qualify for an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b> <b>Oral</b> <b>hearing</b> may be held in the PRRA process if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required. Three prescribed factors under section 167 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations ("IRPR ") restrict the possibility of having an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> in the PRRA process. They remove the discretionary ability of PRRA Officers to call for oral hearings to assess or reassess the credibility of the applicant or the claim. The lack of <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> or the difficulty in obtaining one could adversely affect the fairness of the PRRA process. Moreover, oral hearings address procedural issues such as the right to reply and the duty to disclose. My thesis will demonstrate that: (1) higher level of procedural fairness, arising from common law, necessitates an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> for the PRRA process with respect to credibility assessment; (2) the {{principle of non-refoulement}} is a principle of fundamental justice; and (3) the prescribed factors, for determining whether an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> is required for the PRRA process, violate section 7 of the Charter and cannot be saved by section 1. Therefore, section 167 of the IRPR is unconstitutional and invalid...|$|R

To reiterate our intervention, drawn from original research with youth and seniors (attached to this comment as an appendix), we suggest that considering the wireless needs of particular vulnerable – and, in the case of seniors, rapidly growing – groups will result in benefits to all Canadians. Finally, we maintain that the implementation of a Wireless Code that supports consumer rights is urgent, especially for more vulnerable segments of the Canadian population. The need for such a code evidences the continuing lack of sufficient industry competition in Canada. Increased market competition would address many of the issues raised in the online comments and during the <b>oral</b> <b>hearing...</b>|$|R
