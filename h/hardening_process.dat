A total of 1,400 Salamanders were ordered. Production was slowed, however, by problems producing the armour plate, this being prone to distortion during the <b>hardening</b> <b>process,</b> and shortages of the BR.2 engine. By the end of October 1918 only 37 Salamanders were on RAF charge, and just two of these were in France. The first Salamander-equipped squadron, 157 Squadron, was due to fly out to France with 24 aircraft on 21 November, with more squadrons in the process of forming in the United Kingdom.|$|E
500|$|Prior to the mid 1870s, armor {{was made}} of wrought iron plate, {{sometime}} backed with wood. In the 1870s, compound armor was developed, where a hardened steel face was cemented to a softer iron backing, which prevented cracking. During the late 1880s, nickel-steel armor was devised and in 1890, the Harvey process was developed, where a nickel-steel plate was treated with carbon and hardened in cold water. [...] This process allowed one homogeneous steel plate to have both a hard surface and a softer back which was less likely to crack. During the 1890s, Krupp armor further refined the Harvey process by including additional metals in the alloy and developing a system where the <b>hardening</b> <b>process</b> penetrated more deeply into the plates. Tests showed that [...] of Krupp armor was equal to [...] of Harvey armor, [...] of compound armor, and [...] of wrought iron plate, while in thinner plates, Harvey armor was basically equal to Krupp.|$|E

2500|$|The {{process is}} used to improve three main surface {{integrity}} aspects including scuffing resistance, fatigue properties, and corrosion resistance.

Green or other colors are obtained by adding water at each stage of the process. After the copal has hardened, the aluminum foil is removed and the hardened resin is cut to produce the desired shape (i.e. bead or cabochon). It is then mixed with talcum and heated again in the autoclave. Thereafter, it can [...] be cut and polished to obtain the desired finish.|$|E
2500|$|Glock Ges.m.b.H., an Austrian {{firearms}} manufacturer, {{utilized the}} Tenifer process until 2010, {{to protect the}} barrels and slides of the pistols they manufacture. The finish on a Glock pistol is {{the third and final}} <b>hardening</b> <b>process.</b> [...] It is [...] thick and produces a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating via a [...] nitride bath. [...] The final matte, non-glare finish meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications, is 85% more corrosion resistant than a hard chrome finish, and is 99.9% salt-water corrosion resistant. After the Tenifer process, a black Parkerized finish is applied and the slide is protected even if the finish were to wear off. In 2010 Glock switched to a gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing process. Besides Glock several other pistol manufacturers, including Smith & Wesson and Springfield Armory, Inc., also use ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts like barrels and slides but they call it Melonite finish. Heckler & Koch use a nitrocarburizing process they refer to as Hostile Environment. Pistol manufacturer Caracal International L.L.C. uses ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts such as barrels and slides with the plasma-based Plasox process.|$|E

Carbon steels are not very hardenable meaning they can not be hardened throughout thick sections.

This property of carbon steel can be beneficial, because it gives the surface good wear characteristics but leaves the core tough.|$|R

40|$|Implementation {{of press}} {{hardened}} parts in automobile {{responses to the}} requirement of reduced carbon dioxide emission because the press hardened part has very high ratio of strength to weight. Furthermore, ultra high-strength steels (press hardened parts) increases the vehicle safety. The press <b>hardening</b> <b>processes</b> are prevalently applied in global automotive industries. However, the press <b>hardening</b> <b>processes</b> corresponding to heating, forming, and cooling processes result in harsh contact conditions such as cyclic pressures, high temperatures and complex reactions between coatings and tool steels. Consequently, these harsh contact conditions increase the tool maintenance due to abrasive wear and adhesive wear. In order to study tribological behaviours in the press hardening, two kinds of the tribological experiments have been developed and used. Firstly, a reciprocating test, also called SRV test, is performed at elevated temperatures to study the wear mechanisms under press hardening conditions. However, {{the discrepancy between the}} press hardening and SRV test is obvious. To overcome the disadvantage, a sliding tribometer, also called tribolgoical test, is used as the second tribological test. A unidirectional sliding process is running under the corresponding pressures, temperatures, velocities and sliding distances. These test parameters are based on press hardening simulations. According to the present study, the abrasive wear is the predominant wear mechanism in the uncoated interface of the press <b>hardening</b> <b>processes.</b> When Al-Si coated workpieces are applied in the press hardening, severe adhesive wear, also called galling, substantially occurs in the stamping tool. The modelling of the abrasive and adhesive wear is derived from the Archard wear model in which the specific coefficients for the wear are calibrated by the tribological tests. The wear predictions implemented in the press hardening simulation have been validated by a press hardening experiment, which represents a typical geometry of vehicle components...|$|R

An example of these developments is hardening by grinding, an operation that is being studied to provide an option to the conventional <b>hardening</b> <b>processes.</b> This study presents the use of a cylindrical grinding process to produce a martensitic structure on the surface of SAE 4340 steel workpieces, and aims at adjusting the parameters of this process. To do much, a set of experiments were carried out using three cycles of grinding: the first one just to obtain a workpiece with regular diameter; the second cycle is that which will provide heating and cooling of the ground workpiece; and the last cycle is to provide corrections to the dimensions and roughness. Results of the experiments showed that hardening by grinding is possible and that the workpiece achieved hardness levels compatible to those provided by the conventional <b>hardening</b> <b>processes.</b> The use of such a <b>process</b> for surface <b>hardening</b> purposes has been researched and developed with a view to increasing the productivity of the process, ensuring dimensional and surface quality, in addition to mechanical resistance...|$|R
