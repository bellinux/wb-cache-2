5|$|After {{her mother}} {{announced}} {{she would not}} run for re-election in 2014, Davis filed as a Democratic candidate for county clerk. At a candidates' forum, Davis stated she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was best qualified for the position because of her 26 {{years of experience in}} the clerk's office.|$|E
5|$|Chocolina was {{originally}} {{meant to be}} a waitress in Serendipity, but her design impressed Toriyama enough that he expanded her role into something akin to a shop clerk, and the director wrote a new backstory and new dialogue for her. Isamu Kamikokuryo said that though Chocolina's jovial manner and scanty outfit at times clashed with the game's overall atmosphere, he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was a good inclusion. Chocolina is voiced by Julie Nathanson in English and Seiko Ueda in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|Despite these {{assurances that}} change would be forthcoming, Holmlund came under {{considerable}} pressure from {{some members of}} parliament, particularly those in the Left Alliance, to resign for not acting sooner. Leading the call for her deposition was Anneli Lapintie; Tarja Filatov, parliamentary group {{leader of the opposition}} Social Democratic Party of Finland (SDP) also questioned the government over what it had done since the Jokela incident. Vanhanen launched a defence of the government by saying that iniquiries were ongoing, even into the Jokela case. A survey by pollster Taloustutkimus for YLE showed that dissension towards Holmlund was not widespread: only a quarter of members from smaller parties <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> should step down, only 10% of SDP members (with 80% supporting her to stay on), and 90% of the government's partners wanted her to hold onto her ministry. Amongst the population, 82% <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> should continue.|$|E
50|$|Upon {{returning}} from Italy, Milholland suffered from bouts of depression. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> had been {{barred from the}} front {{because she was a}} woman and not because she was a pacifist. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>she</b> had returned a failure.|$|R
5000|$|Adorable: Ray J <b>felt</b> <b>she's</b> {{not making}} an effort to connect with him.|$|R
60|$|Ursula <b>felt</b> very confused. <b>She</b> {{hugged her}} books, loving them. And <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> loved all the teachers, and Mr. Harby. It was very confusing.|$|R
5|$|Dunderdale was the Progressive Conservative Candidate in the {{district}} of Fortune-Hermitage in the 1993 provincial election. Dunderdale ran against Liberal cabinet minister Oliver Langdon, and while she knew she would not win the election she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> had to send premier Clyde Wells a message about the way he was treating municipalities. In the 1995 Progressive Conservative leadership election Dunderdale served as co-chair of Lynn Verge's successful campaign.|$|E
5|$|Josephine, at 62, <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> {{was too old}} {{to travel}} to India, but two American {{supporters}} visited on her behalf and spent four months building a dossier showing that the lock hospitals, compulsory examination and use of underage prostitutes—some as young as 11—were all continuing to operate. The campaign in Britain pushed again for changes, and Josephine spoke at meetings, published pamphlets and wrote to missionaries in India.|$|E
5|$|The Farrar {{children}} were all engaged in activities outside the home. Timothy played both soccer and ice hockey, while Kate was a ballerina with the State Ballet of Missouri {{by the age}} of ten. During this time, Farrar worked long hours and Green accompanied the children to their activities, though perception of her by other parents at the activities varied—some <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was a supportive mother, while others believed she drove her children too hard and put down their efforts too often.|$|E
50|$|Bay Bay Bay: Bay Bay Bay {{withdrew from}} the {{competition}} as <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> was indeed changing, but that her time at the house was up because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> completely changed.|$|R
60|$|Perhaps <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> did not {{pray for}} him as she prayed for others.|$|R
60|$|Juliet smiled, {{but she did}} not explain. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> was obeying Wingrave's wishes.|$|R
5|$|Wood hired many actors she had {{previously}} worked with and <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> could trust, such as Peter Ellis, Meg Johnson, Kay Adshead and Sue Wallace. Wood also hired several celebrities {{for the show}} including Frank Bruno, Denis Healey, Claire Rayner, Pete Postlethwaite, Maureen Lipman, Hope Jackman, Molly Weir, Henry Kelly, Dora Bryan and Anne Reid (who would star with Wood again in her sitcom dinnerladies in 1999. Kelly and Bryan also made guest appearances in the sitcom).|$|E
5|$|After {{four weeks}} at the Joint Readiness Training Center (JRTC) in Fort Polk, Louisiana, Manning was {{deployed}} to Forward Operating Base Hammer, near Baghdad, arriving in October 2009. From her workstation there, she {{had access to}} SIPRNet (the Secret Internet Protocol Router Network) and JWICS (the Joint Worldwide Intelligence Communications System). Two of her superiors had discussed not taking her to Iraq; it was <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was a risk to herself and possibly others, according to a statement later issued by the Army—but the shortage of intelligence analysts dictated their decision to take her. In November 2009, she was promoted from Private First Class to Specialist.|$|E
5|$|Blyton <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> had a {{responsibility}} to provide her readers with a strong moral framework, so she encouraged them to support worthy causes. In particular, through the clubs she set up or supported, she encouraged and organised them {{to raise funds for}} animal and paediatric charities. The story of Blyton's life was dramatised in a BBC film entitled Enid, featuring Helena Bonham Carter in the title role and first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Four in 2009. There have also been several adaptations of her books for stage, screen and television.|$|E
60|$|Louise gave a long, {{fluttering}} sigh. Somehow, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> could {{rely upon}} this promise.|$|R
50|$|Aubry: Quit because <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> like Kristy Joe {{deserved}} to stay because she liked Bret {{so much and}} <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>she</b> was her friend Kristy Joe a gift by quitting, however Bret revealed {{that she was going}} to be eliminated anyway because Bret <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> was incredibly jealous, and this made him nervous since they had only known each other for a few days.|$|R
60|$|Not {{for years}} had Billie Dore <b>felt</b> embarrassed, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> so now. <b>She</b> judged herself unworthy {{to be the}} {{recipient}} of these very private confidences.|$|R
5|$|Consisting of six chapters, Madonnaland finds Simone visiting Madonna's birthplace, Bay City, Michigan, {{where she}} spoke with the local people about the singer. The book also {{analyses}} Madonna's career and fame, with the author delving into her own music career and obscure Bay City bands. Simone had been initially commissioned to write a new biography about the singer. However, due to already available excess content on her, the author <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> {{would not be able}} to find anything new. Instead, she ended up writing Madonnaland about her own failure to create a Madonna biography, why Bay City did not have any commemoration for the singer, as well as unknown music bands, pop culture and celebrity life.|$|E
5|$|Other {{problems}} also emerged. In 1689, Anne's supporters (including the Marlboroughs and the Duke of Somerset) {{demanded that}} she be granted a parliamentary annuity of £50,000, a sum that would end her dependence on William and Mary. Sarah {{was seen as the}} driving force behind this bill, creating further ill-feeling towards her at court. William responded to the demand by offering the same sum from the Privy Purse, to keep Anne dependent on his generosity. However, Anne, through Sarah, refused, pointing out that a parliamentary grant would be more secure than charity from the Privy Purse. Eventually Anne received the grant from Parliament, and <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> owed this to Sarah's efforts.|$|E
5|$|Stefani {{first came}} {{face to face}} with {{designing}} clothes when she and her mother would sew clothes for themselves when she was young. Stefani comes from a long line of seamstresses, as even her great-grandmother would sew clothes. Stefani made most of the things she wore onstage during concerts. When she became successful and began to tour constantly, she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> lost her way. Then she met the stylist Andrea Lieberman. Lieberman introduced her to ready-to-wear clothing. Later Lieberman became her creative consultant and Zaldy Goco took over as the head designer. Goco later parted ways with L.A.M.B.|$|E
60|$|It {{was a great}} concession, and Mrs. Pullet <b>felt</b> it; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> {{something}} was due to it.|$|R
60|$|Ruth {{acknowledged}} that it was. More than ever <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> {{did not know the}} complete Bailey.|$|R
6000|$|... "I have <b>felt</b> <b>she's</b> {{not quite}} {{up to her}} proper form. Looks thin and {{sometimes}} she's quiet. Then why has young Vernon gone off? I haven't seen him recently." ...|$|R
5|$|The Frank sisters each {{hoped to}} return to school {{as soon as they were}} able, and {{continued}} with their studies while in hiding. Margot took a shorthand course by correspondence in Bep Voskuijl's name and received high marks. Most of Anne's time was spent reading and studying, and she regularly wrote and edited her diary entries. In addition to providing a narrative of events as they occurred, she wrote about her feelings, beliefs, and ambitions, subjects she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> could not discuss with anyone. As her confidence in her writing grew, and as she began to mature, she wrote of more abstract subjects such as her belief in God, and how she defined human nature.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} by Erwin Gutawa, {{who had previously}} collaborated with Chrisye on five albums. In an interview with The Jakarta Post, {{he said that he}} felt guilty as he had never written anything for Chrisye in the time they had worked together; he had intended to make a new song with Chrisye's voice since soon after the latter's death. The lyrics were written by Gutawa's daughter, Gita, who was asked by her father to write as if Chrisye were singing about having died, but his songs living on. Gita, who also sang at the concert, <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> owed something to Chrisye as her first stage performance was at his 2003 Dekade concert.|$|E
5|$|Tsarina Alexandra chose Maria to {{accompany}} Tsar Nicholas II and herself to Yekaterinburg {{when the family}} was briefly separated in April 1918. Maria had grown from a child to a woman {{during the years of}} captivity, according to the Baroness Sophie Buxhoevden, a lady in waiting, and the Tsarina <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> could depend upon her third daughter to help her as she could not rely upon the deeply depressed Olga or Anastasia, who was still a child. Level-headed Tatiana was needed to watch over her ill brother. They were forced to leave their other children behind in Tobolsk because Maria's brother Alexei was ill. The four other children joined their family in Yekaterinburg several weeks later.|$|E
60|$|It {{was not a}} judicious answer. She {{realized}} that, but <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> {{must speak}} with unhesitating candor.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a short}} silence. She turned away; <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> was {{suddenly}} surrounded by a cloud of passion.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the same}} way that Anzaldúa often wrote that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> could not be {{classified}} as only part of one race or the other, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> possessed a multi-sexuality. When growing up, Anzaldúa expressed that <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> an [...] "intense sexuality" [...] towards her own father, animals, and even trees. She was attracted to and later had relationships with both men and women, although she identified herself as a lesbian in most of her writing. Anzaldúa wrote extensively about her queer identity and the marginalization of queer people, particularly in communities of color.|$|R
5|$|After {{graduating from}} Saydel High School in 1983, Robinson {{spent the summer}} {{deciding}} on her career path as {{she worked as a}} department store cashier. She went with her father to help him promote local races. Robinson persuaded him to let her compete in racing, and started off at Toledo Speedway driving a 1976 International semi-tractor. She participated in a five-lap sprint race where she finished second after leading for four laps, and took third position in the feature event. After this Robinson began racing full-time, and won 30 feature races before moving to the super-speedway division in April 1984; she faced early resentment from her male competitors. In the same year, Robinson moved from Iowa to Pennsylvania. Lefty believed Robinson's presence helped to increase fans' interest. Robinson's father acted as her mentor although her mother was against her racing because she <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> would be hurt in a crash.|$|E
5|$|Although Susan Hayward was {{reported}} to be in the running for one of the two female leads, Julie Harris was chosen for the role of Eleanor Lance. Wise had seen Harris on stage, and <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was right for the part of the psychologically fragile Eleanor. Harris agreed to do the film in part because the role was complex and the idea of the house taking over Eleanor's mind was interesting. But she also chose it because she had a long-standing interest in parapsychology. English actress Claire Bloom was cast as Theo. In part, however, the decision to cast Bloom and Johnson was because of Eady Levy requirements that the cast be partly British. To make Bloom's character appear more bohemian, beatnik clothing designer Mary Quant was hired to design mod clothing specifically for the Theodora character.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} 2006, Ahmad Dhani {{threatened}} to disband the group if Maia did not cut back on her performance schedule; he <b>felt</b> <b>she</b> was too busy, {{to the point of}} forgetting their children. Dhani later withdrew his threat, but– after becoming manager– limited the group to one performance a week. He then fired the group's manager, Vita Ramona, who {{threatened to}} bring Dhani to court if he did not apologize for perceived defamation. This situation was exacerbated when Mulan publicly complained of not receiving her share of the band's money and a lack of transparency in the management. She resigned on 30 January 2007, after waiting ten days for her open letter to the management to receive a reply. Mulan then hired a lawyer and sued Dhani, resulting in her contract fee being returned.|$|E
60|$|Helen {{moved across}} {{and sat on}} the arm of her friend's chair. <b>She</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> was going to be very daring.|$|R
60|$|Alice said nothing: she {{had never}} been so much contradicted in her life before, and <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> was losing her temper.|$|R
60|$|When she {{had done}} this, <b>she</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>she</b> had made {{a step in the}} {{direction}} of doing her duty by her money.|$|R
