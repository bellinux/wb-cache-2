5|$|Beginning in 2000, German IDS and ECR Tornados {{received}} the ASSTA 1 (Avionics System Software Tornado in Ada) upgrade. ASSTA 1 involved a replacement weapons computer, new GPS and Laser Inertial navigation systems. The new computer allowed {{the integration of}} the HARM III, HARM 0 Block IV/V and TAURUS KEPD 350 missiles, the Rafael Litening II Laser Designator Pod and GBU-24 Paveway III laser-guided bombs. The ASSTA 2 upgrade began in 2005, primarily consisting of several new <b>digital</b> <b>avionics</b> systems, a new ECM suite and provision for the Taurus cruise missile; these upgrades are to be only applied to 85 Tornados (20 ECRs and 65 IDSs), as the Tornado {{is in the process of}} being replaced by the Eurofighter Typhoon. The ASSTA 3 upgrade programme, started in 2008, will introduce support for the laser-targeted Joint Direct Attack Munition along with further software changes.|$|E

[...] The A-10C first deployed to Iraq in 2007 with the 104th Fighter Squadron of the Maryland Air National Guard. The A-10C's <b>digital</b> <b>avionics</b> and communications systems have greatly reduced {{the time to}} acquire a close air support target and attack it.|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{is introduced}} and demonstrated {{for the study}} of error propagation from the gate to the chip level. The importance of understanding error propagation derives from its close tie with system activity. In this system the target system is BDX- 930, a <b>digital</b> <b>avionic</b> multiprocessor. The simulator used was developed at NASA-Langley, and is a gate level, event-driven, unit delay, software logic simulator. An approach is highly structured and easily adapted to other systems. The analysis shows {{the nature and extent of}} the dependency of error propagation on microinstruction type, assembly level instruction, and fault-free gate activity...|$|R

40|$|Modern <b>digital</b> <b>avionic</b> {{systems with}} {{distributed}} processing require networking {{to connect the}} many elements. Digital Autonomous Terminal Access Communication (DATAC) {{is one of many}} such networks. DATAC has been implemented on the Transport Systems Research Vehicle (TSRV), a Boeing 737 aircraft operated by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Advanced Transport Operating Systems Program Office (ATOPS). This paper presents the TSRV implementation of the DATAC bus, a description of the DATAC system, a synchronization mechanism, details of data flow throughout the system, and a discussion of the modes available with DATAC. Numerous flight tests have been conducted using DATAC as the only means of communication between systems with outstanding results. DATAC is now {{an integral part of the}} TSRV and is expected to satisfy near term as well as future requirements for growth and flexibility...|$|R
500|$|Four {{aircraft}} were {{modified to}} RF-111C reconnaissance configuration during 1979–80, retaining their strike capability. The RF-111C carried a reconnaissance pack with four cameras and an infrared linescanner unit. Four ex-USAF F-111As were refitted to F-111C standard and delivered to Australia as attrition replacements in 1982. There F-111Cs were equipped to carry Pave Tack FLIR/laser pods in the mid-1980s. [...] They underwent an extensive Avionics Upgrade Program through 1998. [...] Under this program, the F-111C was upgraded to <b>digital</b> <b>avionics.</b> This included twin mission computers, modern digital databus, digital weapon management system, new AN/APQ-171 terrain-following radar, new AN/APQ-169 attack radar, and twin ring-laser gyro INS.|$|E
500|$|On 1 June 1973, the Officer Commanding No.82 Wing, Group Captain Jake Newham, led {{the first}} F-111Cs in {{to land at}} Amberley, a gala {{occasion}} attended by the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence, Lance Barnard, the Chief of the Air Staff, Air Marshal Charles Read, the Air Officer Commanding Operational Command, Air Vice Marshal Brian Eaton, and a large media contingent. Read ordered Newham to operate the F-111 with great caution initially, well within limits, lest the controversial aircraft suffer greater damage to its reputation through early attrition. Over its 37-year career with No.82 Wing, the F-111 underwent numerous upgrades, including the Pave Tack infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, and advanced <b>digital</b> <b>avionics.</b> Roles within the wing were demarcated such that No.1 Squadron was the lead strike unit, while No.6 Squadron was primarily tasked with [...] crew conversion training; No.6 Squadron was also responsible for reconnaissance missions using specially modified RF-111Cs until these aircraft were transferred to No.1 Squadron in 1996, and flew leased Learjets for survey work in 1982–87.|$|E
500|$|Along {{with its}} revolutionary variable-sweep wings, the F-111 was {{equipped}} with terrain-following radar and an escape module that allowed the entire cockpit to be jettisoned in an emergency, instead of individual ejection seats. [...] Its top speed was Mach 2.5 and its combat radius gave it the capability of reaching targets in Indonesia from bases in northern Australia. [...] Upon delivery in 1973 it was fitted with analogue avionics and could only drop unguided ("dumb") bombs. In its 37 years of service with the RAAF the type went through several upgrades, including the Pave Tack infra-red and laser-guided precision weapons targeting system, Harpoon anti-shipping missiles, and advanced <b>digital</b> <b>avionics.</b> Alan Stephens, in the official history of the post-war Air Force, described the F-111 as [...] "the region's pre-eminent strike aircraft" [...] and the RAAF's most important acquisition. [...] The closest they came to being used in anger, however, was during Australian-led INTERFET operations in East Timor commencing in September 1999. Both F-111 squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, to support the international forces in case of action by the Indonesian military, and remained there until December; six of No.1 Squadron's aircraft and approximately 100 personnel were involved. From 20September, when INTERFET forces began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained {{at a high level}} of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes if the situation deteriorated. As it happened, INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance by RF-111Cs from 5November through 9December.|$|E
50|$|The MH-47G Special Operations Aviation (SOA) {{version is}} {{currently}} being delivered to the U.S. Army. It {{is similar to the}} MH-47E, but features more sophisticated <b>avionics</b> including a <b>digital</b> Common <b>Avionics</b> Architecture System (CAAS). The CAAS is a common glass cockpit used by different helicopters such as MH-60K/Ls, CH-53E/Ks, and ARH-70As. The MH-47G also incorporates all of the new sections of the CH-47F.|$|R
2500|$|The Hornet {{was among}} the first {{aircraft}} to heavily use multi-function displays, which at the switch of a button allow a pilot to perform either fighter or attack roles or both. This [...] "force multiplier" [...] ability gives the operational commander more flexibility to employ tactical aircraft in a fast-changing battle scenario. It was the first Navy aircraft to incorporate a <b>digital</b> multiplexing <b>avionics</b> bus, enabling easy upgrades.|$|R
40|$|During {{in-flight}} emergencies, a pilot’s workload increases {{significantly and}} it is often {{during this period of}} increased stress that human errors occur that consequently diminish the flight safety. Research studies indicate that many plane crashes can be attributed to ineffective cockpit instrument monitoring by the pilot. This manuscript entails the development of Flight Guardian(FG) system being first of its kind that aims to provide efficient flight-deck awareness to improve flight safety while assisting the pilot in abnormal situations. The system is intended to be used in older aircrafts that cannot easily or cost effectively be modified with modern <b>digital</b> <b>avionic</b> systems. One of the important feature of FG system being not physically connected to the aircraft, avoids any impact on airworthiness or the need for re-certification. For the first time, a composite of techniques including video analysis, knowledge representation, and machine belief representations are combined to build a novel flight-deck warning system. The prototype system is tested in both; simulation based Lab and real flight environments under the guidance of expert pilots. The overall system performance is evaluated using statistical analysis of experimental results that proved the robustness of proposed methodology in terms of automated warning generation in hazardous situations...|$|R
2500|$|The -100 was {{the last}} of the 146 series designs to be {{developed}} into the Avro RJ standard with first deliveries of the Avro RJ70 in late 1993. The RJ70 differed from the 146-100 in having LF 507 engines with FADEC and <b>digital</b> <b>avionics.</b> [...] The RJ70 seats 70 passengers five abreast, 82 six abreast or 94 in high-density configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Both the {{avionics}} {{and principal}} flight controls of the DA42 {{have been designed}} to be user-friendly and to reduce pilot workload. A Garmin G1000 glass cockpit serves as the centrepiece of the aircraft's integrated <b>digital</b> <b>avionics,</b> using a pair of large flat-panel monitors in place of conventional instrumentation and gauges; immediately above these monitors is a horizontal row of standby instruments present as a fail-safe. The monitors display various information on the aircraft, along with navigational data and flight information; both screens can show identical basic information or be configured to flight data on the left monitor and navigation on the right. According to Flight International, the displays are easy to read while features such as the moving map display were considered to be [...] "useful". The DA42 is also outfitted with a sophisticated three-axis Garmin-built GFC 700 autopilot and GWX 70 weather radar.|$|E
2500|$|The CBA 123 Vector project, {{which cost}} US$300 million, was {{therefore}} cancelled, {{with only two}} prototypes built. [...] Although a failure, the project gave Embraer maturity to work with new technologies, {{which led to the}} development of the successful Embraer ERJ 145 family of jets. Some of these new technologies on the CBA 123 were described in the Federal Aviation Administration response to a request for certification of the aircraft: [...] "This airplane incorporates a number of novel or unusual design features, such as <b>digital</b> <b>avionics</b> including, but not necessarily limited to, an electronic flight instrument system (EFIS), attitude and heading reference system (AHRS), engine indication and crew alerting system (EICAS), and full authority digital engine control (FADEC), which are vulnerable to lightning and high-intensity radiated fields (HIRF) external to the airplane. In addition to these novel or unusual design features, the Model CBA-123 also incorporates other unrelated novel or unusual design features. Those features will be the subject of separate notices of proposed special conditions.|$|E
40|$|ITC/USA 2005 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-First Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 24 - 27, 2005 / Riviera Hotel & Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThe {{number of}} {{aircraft}} parameters used in flight-testing has constantly {{increased over the}} years and there is no sign that situation will change in the near future. On the contrary, in modern, software-driven, <b>digital</b> <b>avionic</b> systems, all sorts of parameters circulate through digital buses and can be transferred to on-board data acquisition systems more easily than those converted from traditional analog transducers, facilitating the request for more and more parameters to be acquired, processed, visualized, stored and retrieved at any given time. The constant unbalance between what parameter quantity engineers believe to be “sufficient” for developing and troubleshooting systems in a new aircraft, which tends to grow with aircraft complexity, and the associated cost of instrumenting a test prototype accordingly, which tends to grow beyond budget limits, pushes for new creative ways of handling both tendencies without compromising the ease of performing an engineering analysis directly from flight test data. This paper presents an alternative for handling large collections of flight test parameters through a relational approach, particularly in two important scenarios: the very basic creation and administration of the traditional “Flight Test Parameter List” and the transmission of selected data over a telemetry link for visualization in a Ground Station...|$|R

40|$|A flight {{study was}} {{conducted}} to study pilot workload and the pilot interface with high levels of avionics capability and automation. The study was done in the context of general aviation, single-pilot IFR operations and utilized an experimental, <b>digital,</b> integrated <b>avionics</b> system. Results indicate that such advanced systems can provide improved information to the pilot and increased functional capability. The results also indicate that additional research is needed to increase the knowledge base required to design the pilot interfaces with highly capable systems. A CRT-based moving map display format tested provided excellent navigational situational awareness but was inferior to an HSI for manual path tracking. The complexity of navigation data management, autopilot management, and maintaining awareness of system status contributed to pilot workload and errors. Suggested guidelines for the design of the pilot/avionics interface for advanced avionics systems are given...|$|R

40|$|A 4 D area {{navigation}} system {{was designed to}} guide aircraft along a prespecified flight path (reference path) such that the aircraft would arrive at the approach gate at a time specified by the ATC controller. Key components to achieve this requirement were: (1) stored reference trajectories; (2) a continuously recomputed capture trajectory to a selected waypoint on the reference trajectory so as to achieve the desired time of arrival; (3) electronic situation displays; and (4) a control system to follow the overall trajectory in space and time. The system was implemented in a <b>digital</b> integrated <b>avionics</b> system (STOLAND) installed on a CV- 340 airplane. Although the 4 D system was designed primarily for automatic operation, it was flight tested in a flight director mode (the pilot follows the flight director commands), because the CV- 340 autopilot servos were not tied to the avionics system. The flight test showed that, even in the flight director mode, the pilot did achieve the objectives of path tracking and time of arrival control with only moderate workload. The system also permitted controlled delay {{of the time of}} arrival by path stretching, which takes advantage of the continuously changing capture trajectory to predict the time of arrival. Simulations in the automatic and manual modes were used to complement the flight data...|$|R
