40|$|An {{algorithm}} for retrospective {{registration of}} PET emission and attenuation images is introduced {{based upon the}} assumption that no activity should be present outside the body. Since the attenuation image defines anatomy, it is segmented to identify a foreground template of the subject. This template is mapped to the <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> by a geometric transformation, and the <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> pixels that do not correspond to the foreground template are considered the background pixels for that transformation. An optimal geometric transformation mapping the foreground template to the <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> is sought by maximizing {{the likelihood of the}} background <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> pixels given a background intensity distribution; this background intensity distribution is estimated from the background pixels for the initial position of the template. The current implementation of the algorithm is confined to 2 -D rigid motion, although these constraints are not fundamental to the method. In a preliminary phant [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The term 'low-mass bias' {{has been}} used informally in TGS assays to {{describe}} systematic errors that arise from zero truncation in the <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction. <b>Emission</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction algorithms used in TGS are constrained to give a non-negative result in every image voxel, so repeated assays of samples with low plutonium mass using these algorithms can give results that are high on average. We show that this problem can be avoided by formulating the TGS assay as the total net count rate for the scan times a matrix correction factor derived from the <b>emission</b> <b>image,</b> rather than as {{the sum of the}} individual <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> voxel masses. We also show that this formulation is automatically attained in reconstruction algorithms that preserve the total count rate in projections and that any reconstruction algorithm can be forced into this form by a simple normalization of the mass image...|$|E
40|$|In modern PET scanners, image {{reconstruction}} {{is performed}} sequentially in two steps {{regardless of the}} reconstruction method: 1. Attenuation correction factor computation (ACF) from transmission scans, 2. <b>Emission</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction using the computed ACFs. This reconstruction scheme does not use all {{the information in the}} transmission and emission scans. Post-injection transmission scans contain emission contamination which includes information about emission parameters. Conversely emission scans contain information about the attenuating medium. To use all the available information, the authors propose a joint estimation approach that estimates the attenuation map and the <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> from these two scans. The penalized-likelihood objective function is nonconvex for this problem.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method for}} incorporating anatomical NMR boundary side information into penalized maximum likelihood (PML) <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> reconstructions. The NMR boundary is parameterized as a periodic spline curve of fixed order and number of knots that is known a priori. Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation of the spline coefficients yields an "extracted" boundary, {{which is used to}} define a set of Gibbs weights on the <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> space. These weights, when coupled with a quadratic penalty function, create an edgepreserving penalty that incorporates our prior knowledge effectively. Qualitative analysis demonstrates that our method results in smooth images that do not suffer loss of edge contrast, while quantitative estimates of bias and variance for various values of the smoothing parameter show an improvement over standard quadratically penalized maximum likelihood. 1.

This study determines the fre-quency and mechanisms of misregistration artifacts, identifies their predictors, and validates a method for their routine clinical identification, prevention, or correction. Methods: We per-formed 1, 177 consecutive diagnostic myocardial perfusion PET studies using 1 of 3 protocols: (a) 3 initial consecutive measured attenuation correction (MAC) scans, followed by resting and dipyridamole emission scans; (b) an initial MAC scan (early MAC), followed by emission scans; and (c) a MAC attenuation scan obtained after emission scans (late MAC). Emission im-ages were manually shifted to obtain coregistration with atten-uation and reconstructed again using shifted emission data that eliminated artifactual defects. Measurements on PET images included heart size, heart and diaphragm displacement after dipyridamole, objective quantitative misregistration of attenua-tion and <b>emission</b> <b>images,</b> and size or severity of image defects before and after shifting <b>emission</b> <b>images.</b> Results: Of 1, 177 rest-dipyridamole PET perfusion studies, 252 (21. 4 %) had arti-factual defects due to attenuation–emission misregistration.

30|$|For a {{quantitative}} analysis in {{positron emission tomography}} (PET) or single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), attenuation correction (AC) is mandatory. CTscans or transmission scans are common tools for determination of the attenuation μ-map, {{but in the case}} of a PET/MR hybrid system it is difficult to associate one of these scans. Many techniques have been developed in order to improve AC for PET/MR. Some methods are based on template- or atlas techniques, other methods apply a segmentation technique based on Dixon or UTE (Ultrashort Echo Time) MR to create the μ-map, followed by a standard OSEM reconstruction (OSEM/DIXON and OSEM/UTE). A different approach for AC has been developed by employing the emission sinogram data in the μ-map derivation. In this context, we modified the iterative MLAA (Maximum-Likelihood reconstruction of Attenuation and Activity) algorithm to improve the resulting <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> from the PET/MR system. We constrained the attenuation map update using the UTE μ-map and the T 1 -weighted (T 1 w) MR image in order to improve convergence towards a solution. Results show that the modified MLAA algorithm improved the estimated <b>emission</b> <b>image</b> compared to standard OSEM/UTE and OSEM/DIXON. In certain regions of the brain, in particular close to the skull and the air cavities, the modified MLAA algorithm generated less error than OSEM/UTE and OSEM/Dixon. The modified MLAA algorithm is able to compute an attenuation μ-map that is slightly more similar to the aligned CT μ-map than the UTE μ-map.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Transmission scans are {{necessary}} for estimating the attenuation correction factors (ACFs) to yield quantitatively accurate PET <b>emission</b> <b>images.</b> To reduce the total scan time, postinjection transmission scans have been proposed in which one can simultaneously acquire emission and transmission data using rod sources and sinogram windowing. However, since the post-injection transmission scans are corrupted by emission coincidences, accurate correction for attenuation becomes more challenging. Conventional methods (emission subtraction) for ACF computation from post-injection scans are suboptimal and require relatively long scan times. We introduce statistical methods based on penalizedlikelihood objectives to compute ACFs and then use them to reconstruct lower noise PET <b>emission</b> <b>images</b> from simultaneous transmission/emission scans.
