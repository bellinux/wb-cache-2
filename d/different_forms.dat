5|$|The 'Peaks of Excellence' {{curriculum}} is continuous with the 'Broad-Base Curriculum', with more elaborate programmes {{that cater to}} students’ talent development. For instance, the Young Writers Programme, which is open to students {{who are interested in}} writing, has lessons conducted by various renowned Chinese language essayists in the region to expose and familiarise students to <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> of writing, and encourage them to appreciate <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> of written work. Students also have opportunities to attend cultural symposiums, national and international bi-cultural forums, research on contemporary issues, and embark on refined overseas immersions to strengthen their world and cultural views under the Global Classroom Programme.|$|E

5|$|Coastal {{areas of}} Wales, and those near rivers, produce many <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> {{of fish and}} shellfish. Traditional fishing methods, such as wade netting for salmon, {{remained}} in place for 2,000 years. Welsh coracles, simple boats made of a willow frame and covered in animal hides, were noted by Romans and were still in use in the 20th century. Once landed, fish would generally be wind-dried and smoked, or cured with salt.|$|E

5|$|Oscar Fingal O'Flahertie Wills Wilde (16 October 185430 November 1900) was an Irish {{poet and}} playwright. After writing in <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> {{throughout}} the 1880s, {{he became one}} of London's most popular playwrights in the early 1890s.

After the millennium, newer social dances such as the Cha Cha Slide and the Dougie also caught on and became very popular.|$|E
5|$|The French Limousin breed {{standard}} is applied by international breed associations in slightly <b>different</b> <b>forms.</b> These range from mandatory compliance before an animal can be recorded in a country's herd book (mainly European countries) to voluntary application in others. For example, in Belgium, application of its {{breed standard}} mirrors in most detail the French use, {{and in the}} UK, compliance with its version of the Limousin breed standard is required by the UK breed association's bye-laws.|$|E

5|$|The many <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> of {{periodic}} table have prompted {{the question of}} whether there is an optimal or definitive form of {{periodic table}}. The answer to this question is thought to depend on whether the chemical periodicity seen to occur among the elements has an underlying truth, effectively hard-wired into the universe, or if any such periodicity is instead the product of subjective human interpretation, contingent upon the circumstances, beliefs and predilections of human observers. An objective basis for chemical periodicity would settle the questions about the location of hydrogen and helium, and the composition of group 3. Such an underlying truth, if it exists, is thought to have not yet been discovered. In its absence, the many <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> of periodic table can be regarded as variations on the theme of chemical periodicity, each of which explores and emphasizes different aspects, properties, perspectives and relationships of and among the elements.|$|E
5|$|Up {{through the}} 19th century, {{the scope of}} biology was largely divided between medicine, which {{investigated}} questions of form and function (i.e., physiology), and natural history, which was concerned with the diversity of life and interactions among <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> of life and between life and non-life. By 1900, much of these domains overlapped, while natural history (and its counterpart natural philosophy) had largely given way to more specialized scientific disciplines—cytology, bacteriology, morphology, embryology, geography, and geology.|$|E

5|$|According to Vrba, the impala {{evolved from}} an alcelaphine {{ancestor}}. She noted that while this ancestor has diverged at least 18 times into various morphologically <b>different</b> <b>forms,</b> the impala has continued in its basic form {{for at least}} five million years. Several fossil species have been discovered, including A. datoadeni from the Pliocene of Ethiopia. The oldest fossil discovered suggests its ancient ancestors were slightly smaller than the modern form, but otherwise similar in all aspects to the latter. This implies that the impala has efficiently adapted to its environment since prehistoric times. Its gregarious nature, variety in diet, positive population trend, defence against ticks and symbiotic relationship with the tick-feeding oxpeckers could {{have played a role in}} preventing major changes in morphology and behaviour.|$|E
5|$|According to latter {{episode of}} Devi Mahatmya, Durga created Matrikas from herself {{and with their}} help {{slaughtered}} the demon army. In this version, Kali {{is described as a}} Matrika, who sucked all the blood of demon Raktabija. Kali is given the epithet Chamunda in the text. When demon Shumbha challenges Durga to a single combat, she absorbs the Matrikas in herself and says that they are her <b>different</b> <b>forms.</b> In the Vamana Purana too, the Matrikas arise from different parts of Devi and not from male gods although they are described and named after the male deities.|$|E
5|$|After its rediscovery, {{observers}} often {{assumed that}} the image was always used as a call to inspire women workers to join the war effort. However, during the war the image was strictly internal to Westinghouse, displayed only during February 1943, and was not for recruitment but to exhort already-hired women to work harder. Feminists and others have seized upon the uplifting attitude and apparent message to remake the image into many <b>different</b> <b>forms,</b> including self empowerment, campaign promotion, advertising, and parodies.|$|E

5|$|Batesian mimicry is {{the most}} {{commonly}} known and widely studied of mimicry complexes, such that the word mimicry is often treated as synonymous with Batesian mimicry. There are many other forms however, some very similar in principle, others far separated. It is often contrasted with Müllerian mimicry, a form of mutually beneficial convergence between two or more harmful species. However, because the mimic may have a degree of protection itself, the distinction is not absolute. It can also be contrasted with functionally <b>different</b> <b>forms</b> of mimicry. Perhaps the sharpest contrast here is with aggressive mimicry, where a predator or parasite mimics a harmless species, avoiding detection and improving its foraging success.|$|E
5|$|Dietary {{supplements}} often contain vitamins, but {{may also}} include other ingredients, such as minerals, herbs, and botanicals. Scientific evidence supports the benefits of dietary supplements for persons with certain health conditions. In some cases, vitamin supplements may have unwanted effects, especially if taken before surgery, with other dietary supplements or medicines, or if the person taking them has certain health conditions. They may also contain levels of vitamins many times higher, and in <b>different</b> <b>forms,</b> than one may ingest through food.|$|E

Nonetheless, Hareide himself showed a video clip {{of one of the}} parodies when publicly announcing his stepdown from national politics at the 2007 party congress.|$|E
