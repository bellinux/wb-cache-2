5|$|Based on its {{appearance}} <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light, the Andromeda Galaxy {{is classified as}} an SA(s)b galaxy in the de Vaucouleurs–Sandage extended classification system of spiral galaxies. However, data from the 2MASS survey showed that Andromeda is actually a barred spiral galaxy, like the Milky Way, with Andromeda's bar oriented along its long axis.|$|E
5|$|Located near Alnair is NGC 7213, a face-on type 1 Seyfert galaxy located {{approximately}} 71.7 million {{light years}} from Earth. It has an apparent magnitude of 12.1. Appearing undisturbed <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light, it {{shows signs of}} having undergone a collision or merger when viewed at longer wavelengths, with disturbed patterns of ionized hydrogen including a filament of gas around 64,000 light-years long. It {{is part of a}} group of ten galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Puck is {{the largest}} small inner moon of Uranus, which orbits inside the orbit of Miranda. It is {{intermediate}} in size between Portia (the second-largest inner moon) and Miranda (the smallest of the five large classical moons). Puck's orbit is located between the rings of Uranus and Miranda. Little is known about Puck aside from its orbit, radius of about 81km, and geometric albedo <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light of approximately 0.11.|$|E

5|$|The Sun is the Solar System's {{star and}} by far its most massive component. Its large mass (332,900 Earth masses) {{produces}} temperatures and densities in its core {{high enough to}} sustain nuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium, making it a main-sequence star. This releases {{an enormous amount of}} energy, mostly radiated into space as electromagnetic radiation peaking <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} supernovae have been {{discovered}} in Coma Berenices. Four (SN 1940B, SN 1969H, SN 1987E and SN 1999gs) were in the NGC 4725 galaxy, and another four were discovered in the M99 galaxy (NGC 4254): SN 1967H, SN 1972Q, SN 1986I and SN 2014L. Five were discovered in the M100 galaxy (NGC 4321): SN 1901B, SN 1914A, SN 1959E, SN 1979C and SN 2006X. SN 1940B, discovered on 5 May 1940, was the first observed type II supernova. SN 2005ap, discovered on 3 March 2005, is the brightest known supernova to date with a peak absolute magnitude of about −22.7. Due to its great distance from Earth (4.7 billion light-years), it was not {{visible to the naked}} eye and was discovered telescopically. SN1979C, discovered in 1979, retained its original X-ray brightness for 25 years despite fading <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light.|$|E
5|$|As {{the closest}} planet to Earth, Venus {{has been a}} prime target for early interplanetary exploration. It was the first planet beyond Earth visited by a {{spacecraft}} (Mariner 2 in 1962), {{and the first to}} be successfully landed on (by Venera 7 in 1970). Venus's thick clouds render observation of its surface impossible <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light, and the first detailed maps did not emerge until the arrival of the Magellan orbiter in 1991. Plans have been proposed for rovers or more complex missions, but they are hindered by Venus's hostile surface conditions.|$|E

5|$|In November 1980, the Voyager 1 probe {{visited the}} Saturn system. It sent back the first {{high-resolution}} {{images of the}} planet, its rings and satellites. Surface features of various moons were seen for the first time. Voyager 1 performed a close flyby of Titan, increasing knowledge of {{the atmosphere of the}} moon. It proved that Titan's atmosphere is impenetrable <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> wavelengths; therefore no surface details were seen. The flyby changed the spacecraft's trajectory out from the plane of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>visible</b> and {{near-infrared}} light, {{the rings}} have a reddish color, except the halo ring, which is neutral or blue in color. The {{size of the}} dust in the rings varies, but the cross-sectional area is greatest for nonspherical particles of radius about 15 μm in all rings except the halo. The halo ring is probably dominated by submicrometre dust. The total mass of the ring system (including unresolved parent bodies) is poorly known, but is probably {{in the range of}} 1011to 1016kg. The age of the ring system is not known, but it may have existed since the formation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Infrared {{emission}} {{also reveals}} {{the presence of}} un-ionised material such as molecular hydrogen (H2) and argon. In many planetary nebulae, molecular emission is greatest at larger distances from the star, where more material is un-ionised, but molecular hydrogen emission in NGC 6543 seems to be bright at the inner edge of its outer halo. This {{may be due to}} shock waves exciting the H2 as ejecta moving at different speeds collide. The overall appearance of the Cat's Eye Nebula in infrared (wavelengths 2–8μm) is similar <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light.|$|E

5|$|Little {{more was}} {{discovered}} about Venus until the 20thcentury. Its almost featureless disc gave no hint what its surface might be like, {{and it was}} only with the development of spectroscopic, radar and ultraviolet observations that more of its secrets were revealed. The first ultraviolet observations were carried out in the 1920s, when Frank E. Ross found that ultraviolet photographs revealed considerable detail that was absent <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> and infrared radiation. He suggested this was due to a dense, yellow lower atmosphere with high cirrus clouds above it.|$|E
5|$|On April 19, 1942, Seaborg reached Chicago {{and joined}} the {{chemistry}} group at the Metallurgical Laboratory of the Manhattan Project at the University of Chicago, where Enrico Fermi and his group would later convert uranium-238 to plutonium-239 in a controlled nuclear chain reaction. Seaborg's role was {{to figure out how}} to extract the tiny bit of plutonium from the mass of uranium. Plutonium-239 was isolated <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> amounts using a transmutation reaction on August 20, 1942, and weighed on September 10, 1942, in Seaborg's Chicago laboratory. He was responsible for the multi-stage chemical process that separated, concentrated and isolated plutonium. This process was further developed at the Clinton Engineering Works in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and then entered full-scale production at the Hanford Engineer Works, in Richland, Washington.|$|E
5|$|Seyfert {{galaxies are}} one of the two largest groups of active galaxies, along with quasars. They have quasar-like nuclei (very luminous, distant and bright sources of {{electromagnetic}} radiation) with very high surface brightnesses but unlike quasars, their host galaxies are clearly detectable. Seyfert galaxies account for about 10% of all galaxies. Seen <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light, most Seyfert galaxies look like normal spiral galaxies, but when studied under other wavelengths, the luminosity of their cores is equivalent to the luminosity of whole galaxies the size of the Milky Way.|$|E

5|$|Some animals {{mimic the}} optic {{flow of the}} background, so that the {{attacker}} {{does not appear to}} move when seen by the target. This is the main focus of work on motion camouflage, and is often treated as synonymous with it. An attacker can achieve this by choosing its flight path so as to remain on the line between the target and either some real landmark point, or a point at infinite distance (giving different pursuit algorithms). It therefore does not move from the landmark point as seen by the target, though it inevitably looms larger as it approaches. This {{is not the same as}} moving straight towards the target (classical pursuit): that results <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> sideways motion with a readily detectable difference in optic flow from the background. The strategy works whether the background is plain or textured.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of Blender was supplemented {{by use of}} the IRAC instrument on the Spitzer Space Telescope, which was used on August 30 and November 15, 2010, to further define Kepler-10's light curve {{at the point where}} KOI 072.02 appeared to transit it. It was found that the transiting object did not produce a color, an aspect that is characteristic of stars. This suggested even further that KOI 072.02 was a planet. In addition, the IRAC instrument found no difference in the transit signal when comparing the star's light curve in the infrared and <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light; stars that are aligned with Kepler-10 might appear visibly similar, but would appear different in the infrared.|$|E
5|$|The sound {{values of}} {{modified}} Latin letters {{can often be}} derived {{from those of the}} original letters. For example, letters with a rightward-facing hook at the bottom represent retroflex consonants; and small capital letters usually represent uvular consonants. Apart from the fact that certain kinds of modification to the shape of a letter generally correspond to certain kinds of modification to the sound represented, {{there is no way to}} deduce the sound represented by a symbol from its shape (as for example <b>in</b> <b>Visible</b> Speech) nor even any systematic relation between signs and the sounds they represent (as in Hangul).|$|E
50|$|The {{scattering}} and extinction ("dimming") of {{the radiation}} gives useful {{information about the}} dust grain sizes. For example, if the object(s) in one's data is many times brighter <b>in</b> forward-scattered <b>visible</b> light than <b>in</b> back-scattered <b>visible</b> light, then we know that a significant fraction of the particles are about a micrometer in diameter.|$|R

5|$|Very-high {{redshift}} objects (Lyman-break galaxies) {{cannot be}} seen <b>in</b> <b>visible</b> light and generally are detected in infrared or submillimetre wavelength {{surveys of the}} HDF instead. Observations with the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO) indicated infrared emission from 13 galaxies visible in the optical images, attributed to large quantities of dust associated with intense star formation. Infrared observations have also been made with the Spitzer Space Telescope. Submillimeter observations of the field have been made with SCUBA on the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope, initially detecting 5 sources, although with very low resolution. Observations have also been made with the Subaru telescope in Hawaii.|$|E
