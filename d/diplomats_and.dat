5|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 January, a 60-person Marine and Navy SEAL {{security}} detail was dispatched from Guam aboard two CH-53E Super Stallion helicopters to secure the embassy and prepare for the main evacuation. The two helicopters returned to Guam with the first 61 evacuees. Throughout the day, foreign <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> civilians sought refuge at the embassy. Four waves of five CH-46 Sea Knight helicopters each evacuated the embassy compound shortly after midnight on 6 January. The evacuees were transported to Muscat, Oman, where they disembarked on 11 January. In total, 281 <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> civilians from 30 countries were evacuated, including 12 heads of missions (eight ambassadors and four chargés d'affaires).|$|E
5|$|Violence quickly enveloped {{the city}} in late December 1990, during the Somali Civil War, and on 1 January 1991, the {{ambassador}} contacted the State Department to request the closure and evacuation of the embassy. Approval was given the following day, but violence {{and the collapse of}} the central government prevented the US, and several other countries, from airlifting their <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> civilians through Mogadishu International Airport. The USS Guam and USS Trenton, which were stationed off the coast of Oman, were dispatched to airlift staff from the embassy; American civilians and many foreign diplomats also gathered at the embassy, seeking evacuation. The embassy closed on January 5, 1991 and 281 American and foreign <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> civilians were airlifted by helicopter from the embassy compound to Guam and Trenton.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the senate}} could do little short of {{assassination}} and open rebellion to contravene {{the will of}} the emperor, it survived the Augustan restoration and the turbulent Year of Four Emperors to retain its symbolic political centrality during the Principate. The senate legitimated the emperor's rule, and the emperor needed the experience of senators as legates (legati) to serve as generals, <b>diplomats,</b> <b>and</b> administrators. A successful career required competence as an administrator and remaining in favour with the emperor, or over time perhaps multiple emperors.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before her}} marriage, Anne Boleyn {{was able to}} grant petitions, receive <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> give patronage, and had {{enormous}} influence over her future husband to plead the cause of foreign diplomats.

5|$|Large scale protests, demonstrations, {{and other}} gatherings {{directly}} on First Avenue are rare. Some gatherings {{have taken place}} in Ralph Bunche Park, but it is too small to accommodate large demonstrations. The closest location where the New York City Police Department usually allows demonstrators is Dag Hammarskjöld Plaza at 47th Street and First Avenue, one block away from the visitors' entrance, four blocks away from the entrance used by top-level <b>diplomats,</b> <b>and</b> five blocks away from the general staff entrance.|$|E

5|$|The dispute {{initially}} {{took the}} form of symbolic protests and a campaign by Spanish <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> the state-controlled media. From 1954, Spain imposed increasingly stringent restrictions on trade and the movements of vehicles and people across the border with Gibraltar. Further restrictions were imposed in 1964, and in 1966 the frontier was closed to vehicles. In 1969, after the passing of the Gibraltar Constitution Order, to which Spain strongly objected, the frontier was closed completely and Gibraltar's telecommunications links through Spain were cut.|$|E
5|$|After {{the speeches}} Lieutenant-General Philip Sheridan led a procession, which {{included}} the dignitaries and the crowd, past the Executive Mansion, now the White House, then via Pennsylvania Avenue to the east main entrance of the Capitol, where President Arthur received passing troops. Then, in the House Chamber, the president, his Cabinet, <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> others listened to Representative John Davis Long read a speech written {{a few months earlier}} by Robert C. Winthrop, formerly the Speaker of the House of Representatives when the cornerstone was laid 37 years earlier, but now too ill to personally deliver his speech. A final speech was given by John W. Daniel of Virginia. The festivities concluded that evening with fireworks, both aerial and ground displays.|$|E

5|$|Despite its rapid {{gains and}} popular backing, the new {{administration}} was marked by conflicts between the radical wing and more conservative forces, especially {{over the issue of}} land reform. Two successive abortive coups were able to weaken the Government, and its international status was always contested by Russia. After managing to rally a degree of sympathy from Ottoman political leaders, the Revolution was ultimately isolated by the intervention of Russian <b>diplomats,</b> <b>and</b> ultimately repressed by a common intervention of Ottoman and Russian armies, without any significant form of armed resistance. Nevertheless, over the following decade, the completion of its goals was made possible by the international context, and former revolutionaries became the original political class in united Romania.|$|E
5|$|In 1800, Adams lost {{re-election}} to Thomas Jefferson {{and retired}} to Massachusetts. He eventually resumed {{his friendship with}} Jefferson upon the latter's own retirement by initiating a correspondence which lasted fourteen years. He and his wife established a family of politicians, <b>diplomats,</b> <b>and</b> historians now {{referred to as the}} Adams political family. Adams was the father of John Quincy Adams, the sixth President of the United States. He died on the fiftieth anniversary of the adoption of the Declaration of Independence, and the same day as Jefferson. Modern historians in the aggregate have favorably ranked his administration.|$|E
5|$|Outside North America and Western Europe, the Labrador arrived later. For example, the Russian Retriever Club {{traces the}} arrival of Labradors to the late 1960s, as {{household}} pets of <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> others in the foreign ministry. The establishment of the breed in the Commonwealth of Independent States (former USSR) was initially hindered by the relatively small numbers of Labradors and great distances involved, leading to difficulty establishing breedings and bloodlines; {{at the start of}} the 1980s, home-born dogs were still regularly supplemented by further imports from overseas. Difficulties such as these initially led to Labradors being tacitly cross-bred to other types of retriever. In the 1990s, improved access to overseas shows and bloodlines is said to have helped this situation become regularised.|$|E

5|$|The award ceremony, held {{as planned}} in Oslo City Hall on the {{afternoon}} of 10 December, was attended by about 1,000 VIPs, <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> guests.

The Chinese group was 46-strong, and included astrophysicist Professor Fang Lizhi, Yang Jianli, and exiled former Tiananmen student leaders Chai Ling, Wu'erkaixi, Feng Congde, and Fang Zheng, whose legs were crushed by a tank; the Hong Kong delegation comprised Albert Ho, Emily Lau, and Lee Cheuk-yan. Outside the hall, pro-democracy and human rights activists demonstrated; about 50 China supporters held a protest outside the Norwegian Parliament.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} El-Sherbini {{immediately}} resulted in international reactions, {{with the most}} vocal responses coming from predominantly Muslim nations. The Egyptian public and media focused attention on the religious and racial hatred aspect of the killing, especially as the initial confrontation between the victim and perpetrator had happened because she wore an Islamic headscarf. In response to anti-German sentiments and public protests in Egypt and other countries, the German government issued a statement of condolence nine days after the incident. Wiens's trial for murder and attempted murder occurred under strict security measures and was observed by national and international media, <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> legal experts.|$|E
5|$|The {{members of}} the Chinese Society of Righteous and Harmonious Fists were simply called boxers by the Westerners due to the martial arts and {{calisthenics}} they practiced. It began as an anti-foreign, anti-imperialist, peasant-based movement that attacked foreigners who were building railroads and violating Feng shui. Christians who they felt were responsible for foreign domination of China were also targeted. In June 1900, the Boxers invaded Beijing and killed 230 non-Chinese. The Qing commander in chief Ronglu expelled the Boxers from the city. The Qing ordered foreign <b>diplomats</b> <b>and</b> personnel to leave to Tianjin but they refused and stay put in the legation quarter of Beijing.|$|E
