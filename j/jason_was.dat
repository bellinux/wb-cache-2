5|$|Jason Voorhees is {{the main}} {{character}} from the Friday the 13th series. He first appeared in Friday the 13th (1980) as the young son of camp cook-turned-murderer Mrs. Voorhees, {{in which he was}} portrayed by Ari Lehman. Created by Victor Miller, with contributions by Ron Kurz, Sean S. Cunningham, and Tom Savini, <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> not originally intended to carry the series as the main antagonist. The character has subsequently been represented in various other media, including novels, video games, comic books, and a cross-over film with another iconic horror film character, Freddy Krueger.|$|E
5|$|Morris had {{continued}} to devote much time to writing poetry. In 1867 Bell and Dandy published Morris's epic poem, The Life and Death of Jason, at his own expense. The book was a retelling of the ancient Greek myth of the hero Jason and his quest to find the Golden Fleece. In contrast to Morris's former publication, The Life and Death of <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> well received, resulting in the publishers paying Morris a fee for the second edition.|$|E

5|$|Aware {{that his}} ship was {{suffering}} {{the worst of}} the casualties, L'Héritier ordered his men to attempt to board the British ship of the line, but first one and then another attempt to do so was driven back with heavy casualties. The lighting of Hercule had gone out {{at the beginning of the}} engagement, leaving her crew confused, and as a result, only around 40 men answered when L'Héritier ordered the boarding; he was himself injured twice, to the head by a sabre and to the thigh by a pike, while leading the assault. At 10:30, after an hour of continual bombardment L'Héritier surrendered: Hercules hull had been torn open, five guns were dismounted with others damaged and more than two fifths of the crew killed or wounded. <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> approaching fast and the rest of Bridport's fleet was close enough to see the muzzle flashes from the battle.|$|E
5|$|Justin and Diodorus {{both say}} that Philip also invaded Thessaly in 358 BC. In the years up to 370 BC, Thessaly had enjoyed a brief {{ascendancy}} in the Greek world, after being unified under Jason of Pherae, {{who was appointed}} Tagus (chief magistrate) of Thessaly. However, <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> assassinated in 370 BC, and his son Alexander became Tagus. Alexander ruled harshly, and other states of the Thessalian League therefore withdrew their support for him, resulting in a desultory conflict in which both Macedon (under Alexander II) and eventually Thebes became embroiled. This conflict eventually ended in 364 BC when the Thebans were victorious over Alexander, and imposed a peace settlement on Thessaly. However, with the weakening of Thebes {{in the aftermath of}} Mantinea, on-off conflict within Thessaly continued. Alexander was himself assassinated in 358 BC, by his wife's brothers Lycophron and Tisiphonus, who became tyrants in his place. According to Diodorus, the Aleuadae, the noble family which dominated politics in the northern Thessalian city of Larissa, were opposed to these new tyrants, and requested aid from Philip.|$|E

25|$|Sullivan {{recalled}} {{that he had}} always been fascinated by the unlicensed traders who sold goods from suitcases in markets, and he based Del Boy on them. David Jason added other elements to the part, including Del's cheap gold jewellery and his camel-hair coat. The inspiration was taken from a similar man he had known when working as an electrician. <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> a relatively late candidate for the part: Jim Broadbent (who would later appear in a minor recurring role as DCI Roy Slater) and Enn Reitel were earlier preferences. Broadbent turned down the role, due to the play he was acting in had moved. It was only when producer Ray Butt saw a repeat of Open All Hours that <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> considered and, despite concerns that Jason had not previously had a leading television role, and that he and Lyndhurst did not look like brothers, he was cast.|$|E

25|$|The {{visions of}} {{chapters}} 7–12 reflect the crisis {{which took place}} in Judea in 167–164 BC when Antiochus IV Epiphanes, the Greek king of the Seleucid Empire, threatened to destroy traditional Jewish worship in Jerusalem. When Antiochus came to the throne the Jews were largely pro-Seleucid. The High Priestly family was split by rivalry, and one member, Jason, offered the king a large sum to be made High Priest. Jason also asked – or more accurately, paid – to be allowed to make Jerusalem a polis, or Greek city. This meant, among other things, that city government would {{be in the hands of}} the citizens, which meant in turn that citizenship would be a valuable commodity, to be purchased from Jason. None of this threatened the Jewish religion, and the reforms were widely welcomed, especially among the Jerusalem aristocracy and the leading priests. Three years later <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> deposed when another priest, Menelaus, offered Antiochus an even larger sum for the post of High Priest.|$|E

25|$|Jason and Sam {{first met}} {{when they were}} both arrested for aiding and abetting Sonny Corinthos (Maurice Benard).

The two started to interact more after Sam got involved with a married Sonny, and Jason tried to pay her off so that Sonny would go back to his wife, Carly (then Tamara Braun). Sam refused, and the two were constantly fighting, even after <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> assigned as Sam's bodyguard to protect her from Sonny's enemies. When Sam found out that she was pregnant with Sonny’s child, Jason asks Sam to say he's the baby's father, and let Sonny and Carly stay together for the sake of their sons, Michael (then Dylan Cash) and Morgan. Sam agrees to Jason's request and they almost marry, but Sam backs out because they are not in love and she still has feelings for Sonny.|$|E
25|$|Reyes {{works as}} media buyer in Fairfield, California. She {{is married and}} has two children. She was {{declared}} the runner-up of season 3 on day 82 and won $50,000, losing to Lisa Donahue in a 9-1 vote. This result sparked and still sparks much criticism from BB fans who felt that Danielle lost the game purely on her entries in the Diary Room, where she often spoke about her fellow houseguests in a mocking and critical manner. The following season, the jury house was introduced, {{as a result of}} Danielle's loss. Early on in the game, Danielle teamed up with Jason in a strong but very secretive alliance. The alliance almost took them to the final 2, but they failed to win the final Head of Household prompting Lisa to evict Jason. <b>Jason</b> <b>was</b> Danielle's only vote in the final. In 2006, Danielle accepted an offer to appear on Big Brother 7: All Stars, where she claimed she was seeking redemption for her Big Brother 3 loss.|$|E

Revealing herself as the killer, Mrs. Voorhees turns violent and rushes toward Alice with a bowie knife. A chase ensues, in which Mrs. Voorhees attempts to kill Alice. Alice finds Annie's body inside Mrs. Voorhees's car and Steve's body hanging from the roof. Following a confrontation in which Mrs. Voorhees is knocked out, Alice escapes to the shore.
