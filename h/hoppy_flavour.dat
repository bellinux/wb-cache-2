40|$|Beer brewing is an {{intricate}} process encompassing mixing and further elaboration of four essential raw materials, including barley malt, brewing water, hops and yeast. Particularly hops determine {{to a great}} extent typical beer qualities such as bitter taste, <b>hoppy</b> <b>flavour,</b> and foam stability. Conversely, hop-derived bitter acids account for an offending lightstruck flavour, which is formed on exposure of beer to light. These various processes are presented in detail, while due emphasis is placed on state-of-the-art hop technology, which provides brewers with efficient means to control bitterness, foam, and light-stability thereby allowing for the production of beers with consistent quality...|$|E

Several typ es of secondary metabolites present in hops are at the origin of highly characteristic beer flavour attributes, i. e. beer bitterness and ho ppy aroma. Hop-derived beer bitterness is well defined from a chemi cal point of view and, in current brewing practice, beer bitterness can be adequately dosed and controlled because (advanced) hop products with known composition are available, and optimised analytical methods allow reliable quantification of beer bitterness. In sharp contrast with beer bitterness, the precise nature of hoppy aroma of beer is far from comple tely understood. Although it is generally recognised that mainly volatil e constituents present in, or derived from hop essential oil are involve d, hoppy aroma {{is still one of}} the most controversial aspects of beer fl avour. Indeed, flavour-active key compounds causing this highly desirabl e aspect of beer aroma remain to be identified. This gap can be ascribed to the extreme chemical complexity and varietal dependence of hop essen tial oil itself, and to modifications and losses of hop oil constituents that take place along the brewing process. Obviously, introduction of c onsistent and pleasant hoppy aroma continues to be a serious challenge i n view of obtaining a reproducible and sufficiently stable beer flavour. Whereas conventional hopping inherently leads to flavour inconsistency, currently available hop oil products can be adequately dosed at the pos t-fermentation stage in order to attain the desired hoppy aroma or hop-d erived aroma top note in a much more controlled way. In this manner, enh anced consistency of hoppy aroma in the final beer and development of ne w beers with distinct sensory flavour attributes are feasible objectives. However, the spectrum of hop oil products currently available is rathe r limited (in particular, the varietal aspect of hoppy aroma is not full y exploited), and these products often do not give the intended flavour attributes. From an economic point of view, the above mentioned issues a re highly relevant. Beer flavour consistency is of paramount importance for the modern brewing industry (also because of globalisation of the ma rket) and a too variable hoppy aroma will undoubtedly impair brand typic ality and consumer preference. Beer flavour (in) consistency in respec t of hoppy aroma, together with the unresolved issue of the true nature of hoppy aroma of beer, form the rationale of this PhD study. In general, it aimed at (1) preparation of novel hop aromas extracted directly fro m single hop varieties via supercritical fluid extraction, (2) developme nt and implementation of analytical methodologies for determination of t he volatile composition of the hop aromas and reliable measurement of th e yield of aromatisation of beer with the respective hop essences, (3) d etermination of odour impact compounds of hop oil preparations, and (4) investigation of the impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character o f pilot beers. First, an extensive literature study is presented (Par t I). An introduction to hops in beer preparation, as well as a comprehe nsive literature review on hop aroma as such and hoppy aroma of beer (th e main topic of this PhD), is provided. The experimental work c omprises 3 different parts (Part II, Part III, and Part IV, respectively), that are all further subdivided into two chapters. In Part II Pro duction of novel varietal hop aromas by supercritical fluid extraction o f hop pellets the unique properties of supercritical carbon dioxide ext raction were evaluated for preparation of different types of varietal ho p aromas from hop pellets. In chapter 1, extraction conditions were opti mised for preparation of single variety total hop essential oils that we re subsequently fractionated by solid phase extraction (SPE), yielding h op oil fractions highly enriched in water-soluble, oxygenated constituen ts (polar hop essences). Next, in chapter 2, a new methodology based on density programmed supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) and subsequent S PE fractionation of SFE extracts was developed for preparing floral, cit rus, and spicy hop essences. Sensory properties of all novel hop aromas as such, as well as their impact on beer flavour by aromatising referenc e pilot lagers, exclusively bittered with pre-isomerised hop extract, we re clearly demonstrated and described in both chapters of this study. &nb sp;In Part III Comprehensive chemical-analytical and sensory charac terisation of varietal hop oil preparations, analytical methods based o n headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) and GC-MS were optimis ed and implemented to investigate the volatile composition of varietal f loral and spicy hop essences and total hop essential oils (chapter 3). D etailed analytical characterisation of the typical volatile composition of the different types of (fractionated) hop oils, as well as discrimina tion between varietal hop aromas via principal component analysis, were clearly established. In chapter 4, the focus was on determining odour im pact compounds in floral and spicy hop essences (cv. Spalter Select). By application of advanced gas chromatography in combination with olfactom etric assessment, potent contributors to the odour of floral hop essence were identified and several odour-active regions of hitherto unidentifi ed sesquiterpenoid nature were detected in the aromagram of spicy hop es sence. In Part IV Methodology for determination of hop aromati sation of beer and evaluation of the novel hop oil preparations in brewi ng practice, selective determination of hop oil-derived constituents in the flavour profile of pilot lagers was carried out using HS-SPME in co mbination with gas chromatography and advanced mass spectrometry such as tandem MS and selected ion monitoring (chapter 5). This approach allows monitoring the application of hop oil preparations in beer production and, as a result of this, improved control and specification of hop aroma tisation. Next, in chapter 6, the use of the hop oil preparations was in vestigated in brewing practice. In a comparative study, the impact of th e different types of hop aromas on the hoppy character of pilot lagers, as well as on beer flavour stability, was evaluated through both analyti cal and sensory protocols and compared with <b>hoppy</b> character and <b>flavour</b> stability of conventionally hopped pilot lagers. It was found that the c ontent of analytical markers for hoppy aroma (e. g. linalool and oxy genated sesquiterpenoids) as well as the intensity and the qualitative d escription of hoppy aroma, were dependent on the applied hopping technol ogy and on the hop oil fraction used for beer aromatisation. Interesting ly, sensory evaluation of beer ageing demonstrated that hop aromatisatio n, whether performed in the advanced or the conventional way, significan tly masked beer staling. As a result of our work, an innovative hop aroma technology has bee n developed, allowing the preparation of single variety hop essential oi ls and several refined hop oil fractions with pleasant and distinct sens ory attributes. The impact of the novel hop aromas on hoppy character of pilot lagers was clearly demonstrated. Furthermore, specific analytical and sensory tools were optimised and implemented for detailed character isation of the volatile composition of the novel hop aromas, determinati on of key odour impact compounds in hop essences, and determination of t he yield of aromatisation with the hop oil preparations in brewing pract ice. nrpages: 280 status: publishe...|$|R
