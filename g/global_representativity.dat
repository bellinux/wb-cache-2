40|$|Fluctuations of glaciers and ice caps in cold {{mountain}} {{areas have been}} systematically observed {{for more than a}} century in various parts of the world (Forel 1895) and are considered to be highly reliable indications of worldwide warming trends. Mountain glaciers and ice caps are, therefore, key variables for early-detection strategies in global climate-related observations. Advanced monitoring strategies integrate detailed observations of mass and energy balance at selected reference glaciers with more widely distributed determinations of changes in area, volume and length; repeated compilation of glacier inventories enables <b>global</b> <b>representativity</b> to be reached (Haeberli et al. 2000, 2002). Long-term mass balance (Fig. 1) measurements provide direct (undelayed) signals of climate change and constitute the basis for developing coupled energy-balance/flow models for sensitivity studies. These investigations explore complex feed-back effects (albedo, surface altitude, dynamic response) and can be used in conjunction with coupled ocean-atmosphere general circulation models (model validation, hydrological impacts at regional and global scales, etc.; cf. Beniston et al. 1997). They combine direct glaciological and geodetic/photogrammetric methods in order to determine changes in volume/mass of entire glaciers (repeated mapping) with high spatio-temporal resolution (annual measurements at stakes and pits). Laser altimetry combined a kinematic Global Positioning Syste...|$|E
40|$|Healthy oceans are {{essential}} to human survival and prosperity, yet oceans are severely impacted worldwide by anthropogenic threats including overfishing, climate change, industrialization, pollution, and habitat destruction. Marine protected areas (MPAs) have been implemented {{around the world and}} are effective conservation tools that can mitigate some of these threats and build resilience when designed and managed well. However, despite a rich scientific literature on MPA effectiveness, science is not the main driver behind the design and implementation of many MPAs, leading to variable MPA effectiveness and bias in <b>global</b> MPA <b>representativity.</b> As a result, the marine conservation community focuses on promoting the creation of more MPAs as well as more effective ones, however no structure to improve or accelerate effective MPA implementation currently exists. To safeguard marine ecosystems on a global scale and better monitor progress toward ecosystem protection, robust science-based criteria are needed for evaluating MPAs and synthesizing the extensive and interdisciplinary science on MPA effectiveness. This paper presents a strategic initiative led by Marine Conservation Institute called the Global Ocean Refuge System (GLORES). GLORES aims to set standards {{to improve the quality of}} MPAs and catalyze strong protection for at least 30 % of the ocean by 2030. Such substantial increase in marine protection is needed to maintain the resilience of marine ecosystems and restore their benefits to people. GLORES provides a comprehensive strategy that employs the rich body of MPA science to scale up existing marine conservation efforts...|$|R
