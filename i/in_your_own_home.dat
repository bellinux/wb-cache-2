You must recollect that there are virtues--graces we call them rather--which you may learn elsewhere better than in the camp or on the drilling ground; graces of character more devout, more pure, more tender, more humane, yet necessary for the perfect man, which you will learn rather <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>homes,</b> from the innocence of <b>your</b> <b>own</b> children, from the counsels and examples of your mothers and your wives.|$|R

60|$|Ladies and gentlemen,--It {{would be}} worse than idle--for it would be hypocritical and unfeeling--if I were to {{disguise}} that I close this episode in my life with feelings of very considerable pain. For some fifteen years, in this hall and in many kindred places, I have had the honour of presenting my own cherished ideas before you for <b>your</b> recognition, and, <b>in</b> closely observing <b>your</b> reception of them, have enjoyed an amount of artistic delight and instruction which, perhaps, is given to few men to know. In this task, and in every other I have ever undertaken, as a faithful servant of the public, always imbued {{with a sense of}} duty to them, and always striving to do his best, I have been uniformly cheered by the readiest response, the most generous sympathy, and the most stimulating support. Nevertheless, I have thought it well, at the full flood- tide of your favour, to retire upon those older associations between us, which date from much further back than these, and henceforth to devote myself exclusively to the art that first brought us together. Ladies and gentlemen, in but two short weeks from this time I hope that you may enter, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>own</b> <b>homes,</b> on a new series of readings, at which my assistance will be indispensable; {23} but from these garish lights I vanish now for evermore, with a heartfelt, grateful, respectful, and affectionate farewell.|$|R

However, the attack which then occurred was totally unnecessary and amounted to a very violent revenge attack on a defenceless man. It may be that some members of the public or media commentators will assert that Salem deserved what happened to him, and that you should not have been prosecuted and need not be punished. The courts must make it clear that such conduct is criminal and unacceptable ...
