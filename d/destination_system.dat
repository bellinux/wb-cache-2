40|$|Purpose - <b>Destination</b> {{recommender}} <b>systems</b> need {{to become}} truly human-centric in their design and functionality. This requires a profound understanding of human interactions with technology as well as human behavior related to information search and decision-making {{in the context of}} travel and tourism. This paper seeks to review relevant theories that can support the development and evaluation of <b>destination</b> recommender <b>systems</b> and to discuss how quantitative research can inform such theory building and testing. Design/methodology/approach - Based on a review of information search and decision-making literatures, a framework for the development of <b>destination</b> recommender <b>systems</b> is proposed and the implications for the design and evaluation of human-centric recommender systems are discussed. Findings - A variety of factors that influence the information search and processing strategies that influence interactions with a <b>destination</b> recommender <b>system</b> are identified. This reveals a great need for data-driven models to inform recommender system processes. Originality/value - The proposed framework provides a basis for future research and development in the area of <b>destination</b> recommender <b>systems.</b> The paper concludes that the success of a specific <b>destination</b> recommender <b>system</b> will depend largely on its ability to anticipate and respond creatively to transformations in the personal and situational needs of its users. Such system intelligence needs to be based on empirical data analyzed with sophisticated quantitative methods. The importance of recommender systems in tourism marketing is also discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The game {{featured}} a famous [...] "wormhole" [...] bug: Normally a ship’s hyperdrive has {{a range of}} about 15 light years at most, so planetary systems dozens of light years away are too far to reach in one hyperspace jump. However, if the player happened to find a system 655.36 to 670.36 light years away, it would be counted by the game as within the [...] "15 light year" [...] range. This would also happen for systems slightly beyond 1310.72 light years, 1966.08 light years, and other multiples of 655.36. With a bit of careful triangulation it was usually possible to get near or directly to a <b>destination</b> <b>system</b> any distance away by means of just two such [...] "wormhole" [...] jumps.|$|E
50|$|As Alderson points can be {{difficult}} to find, even when their position is known in principle, human astrogators bring their ships to as near a complete stop as they can, enabling them to precisely determine their position before jumping. A ship approaching a point thus must decelerate, increasing travel time between points. A possible alternative, discussed in The Gripping Hand, is to reach the point at speed and activate the drive at precisely the right time. Human astrogators apparently lack the requisite instincts and precision, but Motie warriors are capable of this. However, in most alignments of Alderson points, the ship will have to significantly change direction upon arrival in the <b>destination</b> <b>system,</b> possibly requiring significantly more acceleration than after a jump at rest and in most cases wasting time.|$|E
5000|$|The token-based {{topology}} {{works by}} using a token {{to provide access to}} the physical media. In a token-based network, there is a token that travels around the network. When a system needs to send out packets, it grabs the token off of the wire, attaches it to the packets that are sent, and sends it back out on the wire. As the token travels around the network, each system examines the token. When the packets arrive at the <b>destination</b> <b>systems,</b> those systems copy the information off of the wire and the token continues its journey until it gets back to the sender. When the sender receives the token back, it pulls the token off of the wire and sends out a new empty token to be used by the next machine.|$|R

5000|$|The company's {{name for}} their {{proprietary}} control system, {{was introduced in}} 1995. It was the industry's first example of control system now known as [...] "hall call" [...] <b>destination</b> <b>system.</b> The system features keypads and LED screens instead of hall button stations whereby riders enter their desired floor before entering an elevator car. The system then directs the rider to a specific elevator car, while grouping riders traveling to nearby floors together. Schindler claims this minimizes the number of stops, and decreases congestion and travel time—especially during peak traffic periods. The system was continuously further developed and new functions were amended, eventually evolving in systems which guarantee highly efficient and energy-saving traffic management. Especially in high rise buildings, traffic-management systems like Miconic 10 allow building designers to maximize rentable space and transportation efficiency. Moreover, access control becomes feasible.|$|E
50|$|Network latency in a packet-switched {{network is}} {{measured}} either one-way (the {{time from the}} source sending a packet to the destination receiving it), or round-trip delay time (the one-way latency from source to destination plus the one-way latency from the destination back to the source). Round-trip latency is more often quoted, {{because it can be}} measured from a single point. Note that round trip latency excludes {{the amount of time that}} a <b>destination</b> <b>system</b> spends processing the packet. Many software platforms provide a service called ping that can be used to measure round-trip latency. Ping performs no packet processing; it merely sends a response back when it receives a packet (i.e. performs a no-op), thus it is a first rough way of measuring latency. Ping cannot perform accurate measurements, principally because it uses the ICMP protocol that is used only for diagnostic or control purposes, and differs from real communication protocols such as TCP. Furthermore, routers and ISP's might apply different traffic shaping policies to different protocols.|$|E
5000|$|Like Elite, Oolite is a first-person, open-ended, single-player space {{trading and}} combat simulator. The player is {{the pilot of}} a spacecraft, capable of {{interstellar}} travel to other nearby planetary systems using wormholes generated by the ship's engines. Each system contains only one inhabited planet, with an orbiting space station; players choose the <b>destination</b> <b>system</b> {{by the name of}} its planet. Although players can create outgoing wormholes almost anywhere within a system, assuming their engines have sufficient fuel to do so, ships always enter a new system at a considerable distance from the target planet. The player must then pilot their ship from the entry point, through [...] "normal" [...] space, to the station. During this stage of the journey the player can encounter other ships, and combat can occur. Oolite spaceships' principal armaments are lasers and missiles. Most combats are dogfights and the ships exhibit non-Newtonian flight characteristics, being immune from the effects of inertia and gravity.|$|E

When the player’s ship is close enough to the jump point, the player can activate the jump drive, and [...] "jump" [...] to another solar system in a few seconds. In typical solar systems, there is an assortment of jump points, each point leading to another system.

This led to David Crocker, John Vittal, Kenneth Pogran, and Austin Henderson publishing RFC 733, [...] "Standard for the Format of ARPA Network Text Message" [...] (November 21, 1977), a subset of which provided a stable base for common use on the ARPANET, but which was not fully effective, and in 1979, a meeting was held at BBN to resolve incompatibility issues. Jon Postel recounted the meeting in RFC 808, [...] "Summary of Computer Mail Services Meeting Held at BBN on 10 January 1979" [...] (March 1, 1982), which includes an appendix listing the varying email systems at the time.
