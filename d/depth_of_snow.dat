5|$|In {{the fall}} of 1852, McClellan {{published}} a manual on bayonet tactics that he had translated from the original French. He also received an assignment to the Department of Texas, with orders to perform a survey of Texas rivers and harbors. In 1853 he participated in the Pacific Railroad surveys, ordered by Secretary of War Jefferson Davis, to select an appropriate route for the planned transcontinental railroad. McClellan surveyed the western portion of the northern corridor along the 47th and 49th parallels from St. Paul to the Puget Sound. In so doing he demonstrated a tendency for insubordination toward senior political figures. Isaac Stevens, governor of the Washington Territory, became dissatisfied with McClellan's performance in scouting passes across the Cascade Range. McClellan selected Yakima Pass without a thorough reconnaissance and refused the governor's order to lead a party through it in winter conditions, relying on faulty intelligence about the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> pack in that area. In so doing, he missed three greatly superior passes in the near vicinity, {{which would be the}} ones eventually used for railroads and interstate highways. The governor ordered McClellan to turn over his expedition logbooks, but McClellan steadfastly refused, most likely because of embarrassing personal comments that he had made throughout.|$|E

He had entered a valley or was traversing a wide, gently sloping pass. He went through thickets of juniper, and had to go around clumps of quaking aspen. The pines grew larger and farther apart. Cedars and pinyons had been left behind, and he had met with no silver spruces after leaving camp. Probably that point was {{the height of a}} divide. There were banks of snow in some of the hollows on the north side. Evidently the snow had very recently melted, and it was evident also that the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> through here had been fully ten feet, judging from the mutilation of the juniper-trees where the deer, standing on the hard, frozen crust, had browsed upon the branches.|$|E
60|$|Behold here a change, wrought in the {{twinkling}} of an eye, like {{an incident}} in a tale of magic, even while your observation has been fixed upon the scene. The Main Street has vanished out of sight. In its stead appears a wintry waste of snow, with the sun just peeping over it, cold and bright, and tingeing the white expanse with the faintest and most ethereal rose-color. This is the Great Snow of 1717, famous for the mountain-drifts in which it buried the whole country. It would seem as if the street, the growth of which we have noted so attentively, following it from its first phase, as an Indian track, until it reached the dignity of sidewalks, were all at once obliterated, and resolved into a drearier pathlessness than when the forest covered it. The gigantic swells and billows of the snow have swept over each man's metes and bounds, and annihilated all the visible distinctions of human property. So that now the traces of former times and hitherto accomplished deeds being done away, mankind should be at liberty to enter on new paths, and guide themselves by other laws than heretofore; if, indeed, the race be not extinct, and it be worth our while {{to go on with}} the march of life, over the cold and desolate expanse that lies before us. It may be, however, that matters are not so desperate as they appear. That vast icicle, glittering so cheerlessly in the sunshine, must be the spire of the meeting-house, incrusted with frozen sleet. Those great heaps, too, which we mistook for drifts, are houses, buried up to their eaves, and with their peaked roofs rounded by the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> upon them. There, now, comes a gush of smoke from what I judge to be the chimney of the Ship Tavern;--and another--another--and another--from the chimneys of other dwellings, where fireside comfort, domestic peace, the sports of children, and the quietude of age are living yet, in spite of the frozen crust above them.|$|E
6000|$|Our visitor had {{travelled}} in a dog cariole. This {{machine is}} very narrow, just broad enough to admit one person. It is a wooden frame covered with deer-skin parchment, painted gaudily, and is generally drawn by four Esquimaux dogs [see note 3]. Dogs are invaluable in the Arctic regions, where horses are utterly useless, {{owing to the}} <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> which covers the earth for so large {{a portion of the}} year. The comparatively light weight of the dogs enables them to walk without sinking much; and even when the snow is so soft as to be incapable of supporting them, they are still able to sprawl along more easily than any other species of quadruped could do. Four are usually attached to a sledge, which they haul with great vigour; being followed by a driver on snow-shoes, whose severe lash is brought to bear so powerfully {{on the backs of the}} poor animals, should any of them be observed to slacken their pace, that they are continually regarding him with deprecatory glances as they run along. Should the lash give a flourish, there is generally a short yelp from the pack; and should it descend amongst them with a vigorous crack, the vociferous yelling that results is perfectly terrific. These drivers are sometimes very cruel; and when a pack of dogs have had a fight, and got their traces hopelessly ravelled (as is often the case), they have been known to fall on their knees in their passion, seize one of the poor dogs by the nose with their teeth, and almost bite it off. Dogs are also used for dragging carioles, which vehicles are used by gentlemen in the Company's service who are either too old or too lazy to walk on snow-shoes. The cariole is in form not unlike a slipper bath, both in shape and size. It is lined with buffalo robes, in the midst of a bundle of which the occupant reclines luxuriously, while the dogs drag him slowly through the soft snow, and among the trees and bushes of the forest, or scamper with him over the hard-beaten surface of a lake or river; while the machine is prevented from capsizing by a voyageur who walks behind on snow-shoes, holding on to a line attached to the back part of the cariole. The weather during winter is so cold that it is often a matter of the greatest difficulty for the traveller to keep his toes from freezing, despite the buffalo robes; and sometimes, when the dogs start fresh in the morning, with a good breakfast, a bright, clear, frosty day, and a long expanse of comparatively open country before them, where the snow from exposure has become quite hard, away they go with a loud yelp, upsetting the driver in the bolt, who rises to heap undeserved and very improper epithets upon the poor brutes, who, careering over the ground at the rate of eleven miles an hour, swing the miserable cariole over the snow, tear it through the bushes, bang it first on one side, then on the other, against stumps and trees, yelling all the while, partly with frantic glee at the thought of having bolted, and partly with fearful anticipation of the tremendous welting that is to come; until at last the cariole gets jammed hard and fast among the trees of the forest, or plunges down the steep bank of a river head over heels till they reach the foot--a horrible and struggling compound of dogs, traveller, traces, parchment, buffalo robes, blankets, and snow! ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{outlines}} the first meteorological measurements {{taken from a}} snow pit in the Gorski kotar region, which {{is located in the}} mountainous western part of Croatia. The aim of the research was to determine the main meteorological characteristics of the location.

Temperature and relative humidity were measured inside and in the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>snow</b> pit. Two samples from different <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> accumulated {{at the bottom of the}} pit were collected for analysis. Changes in temperature and relative humidity in the vicinity <b>of</b> the <b>snow</b> pit showed typical seasonal variations. The values inside the pit were constant. The pH measurements <b>of</b> the <b>snow</b> samples showed no indication of an increased acidity of snowmelt at the monitoring location. Further research in some other snow pits should be conducted in order to test the general relevance of the obtained results...|$|R

However, night-time temperatures remained low, and there was a fresh snowfall on 12 February. After this high pressure began to move across the UK and despite further night time frosts a slow thaw began. On 20 February an Atlantic system finally arrived bringing mild south westerly winds and rain which escalated the thaw and allowed temperatures to return to double figures.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Knowledge on {{the spatial}} and {{temporal}} distribution <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> is one <b>of</b> the key parameter {{in the assessment of}} avalanche hazards, for snow drift and avalanche modelling and model verification. Reliable measurements <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>depth</b> distribution are <b>of</b> interest for practitio-ners as well as for scientists. Most of the conventional methods like snow pits, probing or profiling deliver point information or transects <b>of</b> <b>snow</b> <b>depth,</b> snow density or snow water equivalent. At that, direct (in situ) measurements are chancy in High Alpine terrain. To overcome these restric-tions, remote monitoring techniques are applied. Terrestrial scanning lidar survey represents a powerful tool to map inaccessible alpine terrain. In winter 2005 / 2006 numerous measurements with the terrestrial scanning lidar have been done at the test site in the Wattener Lizum (Tyrol, Austria). The analysis of the repeated surveys provide changes in the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>snow</b> cover...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{present the results}} of the Long-eared Owl (Asio otus) census {{performed}} in 2014 - 2015 winter in the Argeş County (Romania). The exact place of the birds agglomerations, the characters of the roosting place, degrees of protection against the wind, the direction of the roosting place in relation to the closest building, endangering and disturbing factors, the disturbing degree, other information regarding the roosting place were analysed. Four places of roosting were identified in Suseni, Rociu, Negraşi and Slobozia. 0. 94 individuals per km of road, 14. 11 individuals per roosting place and 0. 067 roosting places per km of road were estimated. In the Romanian Plain of the Argeş County, there are in average 47. 98 individuals/ 100 km 2 (3. 4 roosting places/ 100 km 2) and approximately 655 individuals (gathered in ca. 46 roosting places) and in the entire Argeş County, there are ca. 800 - 1100 individuals and 60 - 80 roosting places. The mean of the owls’ number per tree in the roosting place was 6. 57. It has been found that between November and March, the number of individuals generally grows as the air temperature raises and generally decreases as the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>snow</b> bed increases.
