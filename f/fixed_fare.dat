5|$|In {{its last}} two years of operation, wartime rises in costs made the <b>fixed</b> <b>fare</b> {{structure}} untenable, and between July 1939 and January 1941 there were five slight adjustments to the fares. The live passenger rates rose to 7s5d in first class and 2s6d in third class, with equivalent changes to the fares for coffins. These fares remained far cheaper than the equivalent fares from Waterloo to Brookwood for both living and dead passengers on the Southern Railway (SR), which had absorbed the LSWR in the 1923 restructuring of Britain's railways. The fare structure of January 1941 remained in use following the April 1941 suspension of London Necropolis Railway services, for the occasional funerals conducted by the LNC using the SR's platforms at Waterloo station, but the SR only allowed mourners attending funerals to use these cheap fares and not those visiting the cemetery.|$|E

5|$|Intentionally {{set at a}} {{low level}} {{at the time the}} {{cemetery}} and railway opened, in later years the <b>fixed</b> <b>fares</b> offered a very substantial saving over main line tickets to Brookwood (in 1902 the 4s LSWR third class fare to Brookwood was twice the cost of the LNC's equivalent). Additional LNC traffic was generated by golfers disguised as mourners travelling to the golf course which had been built on those parts of the land bought by the LNC in 1852 which had not yet been incorporated into the cemetery. The <b>fixed</b> <b>fares</b> prompted complaints from other London funeral firms after the opening of Woking Crematorium in 1885, as rival undertakers were not given access to the LNC's cheap trains and had to pay the LSWR's cargo rate (24shillings in 1885) to ship a coffin to Brookwood or Woking stations for transfer to the crematorium.|$|R

50|$|In some places, {{like some}} African cities and also Hong Kong, share taxi minibuses are overseen by syndicates, unions, or route associations. These groups often {{function}} {{in the absence of}} a regulatory environment and may collect dues or fees from drivers (such as per-use terminal payments, sometimes illegally), set routes, manage terminals, and <b>fix</b> <b>fares.</b> Terminal management may include ensuring each vehicle leaves with a full load of passengers.|$|R
5000|$|Public {{transportation}} vehicles {{contain the}} letters [...] "BUS" [...] for buses or [...] "TX" [...] for taxis on their yellow licence plates. The government regulates taxi service, setting <b>fixed</b> <b>fares</b> {{rather than using}} a metered system. Taxi cabs are supposed to keep {{a copy of the}} rates inside the vehicle. On Antigua, taxis are easily found, particularly at the airport and at major hotels. Many taxi drivers also will act as tour guides.|$|R
50|$|Public {{transport}} {{is provided}} by a bus service operated by government-owned Public Transport Service Corporation (PTSC), privately owned mini-buses (locally known as maxi-taxis) and privately owned cars. Maxi-taxis and some cars carry passengers along fixed routes for a <b>fixed</b> <b>fare,</b> although cars are slightly more expensive for similar routes carried by maxi-taxis because of their much smaller passenger capacities. Car taxis {{are not allowed to}} utilise the Priority Bus Route, and as such maxi-taxis and buses are preferable for speedily entering and exiting the cities (especially Port of Spain) during rush hour (7am-9am and 4pm-6pm).|$|E
5000|$|Most city buses have a <b>fixed</b> <b>fare.</b> A one-day bus {{pass and}} a {{combined}} unlimited train and bus pass are also available.

The municipal transport company publishes a very useful leaflet called [...] "Bus Navi." [...] It contains a route map for the bus lines to most sights and fare information. This too {{is available at the}} information center in front of the main station.|$|E
50|$|The city boasts its Color-coded Public Transportation System {{which it}} has pioneered in the country. All public utility jeepneys and {{tricycles}} have its own color code depending on the district, zone or route that it is serving. It is also used for the computation of fares. For tricycles, fares will differ depending on your zone of origin and destination. For jeepneys, fares increases on every kilometer after the first three kilometers of the route, with an exception on yellow jeepneys, which has a <b>fixed</b> <b>fare</b> end-to-end. The minimum fare for tricycles are Php 7.50 per person, while Php 7.00 for jeepneys.|$|E

The exact fare must be tendered, or payment {{can be made}} by Octopus card. On some routes, passengers may pay a portion of the full fare (called section fare) if they are only travelling a section of the route. Sections are usually distinctive physical landmarks, such as crossing a tunnel or a bridge.|$|R
5000|$|The jeepney rapidly {{emerged as}} a popular and {{creative}} way to re-establish inexpensive public transportation, much {{of which had been}} destroyed during World War II. Recognizing the widespread use of these vehicles, the Philippine government began to regulate their use. Drivers now must have specialized driver's licenses. Routes are regulated and prices are <b>fixed</b> <b>fares.</b> Illegal (unfranchised) operators are officially referred to as [...] "colorum" [...] operations, from the colour of the vehicle plate, which denotes a private rather than public registration.|$|R
40|$|Airline {{regulation}} {{is assumed to}} <b>fix</b> <b>fares</b> {{and the number of}} competitors. Noncooperative schedule determination in a single regulated market served by a small number of carriers is analyzed. Comparative static effects of changes in cost and demand conditions, regulated fares, and numbers of carriers on rates of return, load factors, flight frequency, and excess profits are considered. The signs of important effects are either definite or depend simply on one or two observable magnitudes. Interpretations of the results are presented, and some implications for regulatory policy and future research are discussed. ...|$|R
5000|$|The ZRs (pronounced [...] "Zed-Rs"), are {{privately owned}} mini-vans {{that run on}} {{specific}} predetermined routes. They are recognized by their white exterior and maroon stripe down the side. ZRs are independently owned but have a <b>fixed</b> <b>fare</b> of two dollars per person for one way. According to travel agencies, ZRs are not only the most reliable form of public transportation, but they also provide entertainment to its customers. ZRs move quickly and stop frequently {{to pick up the}} maximum number of paying passengers in the shortest amount of time. Therefore, ZRs have a reputation for loud music and cramped spacing.|$|E
50|$|Similar {{to public}} transport, they operate along {{numbered}} routes {{around the city}} and have a <b>fixed</b> <b>fare</b> (1.50 leva in Sofia, equivalent to €0.75 as of 2014); the fare is paid upon getting in. Marshrutkas are not obliged to stop anywhere on the route, although there are popular spots where they do slow down. Marshrutka drivers are asked to stop and pick one up in a taxi-like manner; the getting-off is arranged with the driver, often by just standing up and approaching the door. Sometimes the driver will ask for consent to veer off the charted path to avoid a traffic jam or roadworks.|$|E
50|$|Public buses in Greater Tokyo usually serve a {{secondary}} role, feeding bus passengers {{to and from}} train stations. Exceptions are long distance bus services, buses in areas poorly served by rail (not many exist), and airport bus services for people with luggage. Tokyo Metropolitan Bureau of Transportation operates Toei buses mainly within the 23 special wards while private bus companies (mostly the subsidiaries of the large train operators listed above) operate other bus routes, as do other city governments, such as Kawasaki City Bus, Yokohama City Bus, etc. Toei buses have a <b>fixed</b> <b>fare</b> of 210 yen per ride, while most other companies charge according to distance. Some train operators offer combined bus/train tickets; special fares apply for children, seniors and the disabled. Some routes feature non-step buses with a kneeling function to assist mobility-impaired users.|$|E
50|$|Streetcars paid {{ordinary}} {{business and}} property taxes, but also generally paid franchise fees, maintained {{at least the}} shared right of way, and provided street sweeping and snow clearance. They were also required to maintain minimal service levels. Many franchise fees were fixed, or {{were based on the}} gross, not the net; such arrangements, when combined with <b>fixed</b> <b>fares,</b> were to create impossible financial pressures later. Early electric cars generally had a two-man crew, a holdover from horsecar days, which created financial problems in later years as salaries outpaced revenues.|$|R
5000|$|On 11 September 2013, the MMOPL {{said that}} the metro would {{commence}} operations in December 2013, {{regardless of whether or}} not the fare increase was granted. The Union Urban Department Ministry brought the Mumbai Metro under the Metro Railways (Construction of Works) Act of 1978 on 18 November 2013, thereby granting MMOPL the authority to <b>fix</b> <b>fares.</b> Prior to this notification, Line 1 was under the Indian Tramways Act, 1886, and the Chief Minister had the sole power to decide fare revisions. In a letter to the state government dated 7 February, the Urban Development Ministry stated, [...] "MMOPL can <b>fix</b> the <b>fare</b> afresh after obtaining the recommendation of the Fare Fixation Committee (FFC). However, no FFC recommendation is necessary to fix the initial fare." [...] Fare fixation is governed by relevant provisions of the Metro Railways (operations and maintenance) Act, 2002. The Ministry's notification permits initial fare fixation without an FFC recommendation, but makes it mandatory for subsequent fare revisions.|$|R
25|$|The {{greatest}} problem {{are with}} fares. As the minibuses {{do not have}} <b>fixed</b> <b>fares,</b> routes and timetables, the fluctuations in fares can be quite large. Some routes may reduce their fares to an unreasonable price {{in order to win}} more passengers, but when demand increases (e.g. during typhoons, when regulated buses and minibuses services are suspended), they can make increases in fares without limitation. For example, the route from Aberdeen to Wah Fu Estate could increase from $3 to $30 (probably equivalent to the fare travelled on a taxi), and the route from Jordan Road to Yuen Long could increase to $80, such acts have resulted in complaints from passengers.|$|R
