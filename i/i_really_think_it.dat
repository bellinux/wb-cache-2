500|$|According to Lamonica, the 1965 {{team had}} a new emphasis: [...] "In '64 we had {{depended}} a lot on Gilchrist and our running attack to carry us...But that all changed in '65. [...] The Bills had traded Gilchrist in the off season to the Denver Broncos. So {{we went to a}} pass-oriented game more that season than we ever had before. [...] We not only went to our receivers, but we threw a lot to our running backs. And <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> brought out the best in Jack that year." [...] In 1965, the Bills finished with a 10–3–1 record. Kemp finished the season second in the league in pass completions. In the 1965 AFL Championship Game, Buffalo defeated the Chargers 23–0; for Kemp, the victory was special because it came against his former team. Kemp's role in leading the Bills to a repeat championship without Gilchrist and with star receiver Elbert Dubenion playing only three games earned him a share of the AFL MVP awards that he split with former Charger teammate, Paul Lowe. Kemp also won the Associated Press award and the Championship Game Most Valuable Player award.|$|E

For her {{achievements}} she was presented with two Fed Cup Heart Awards. [...] "I think it’s great to play Fed Cup," [...] said Radwańska, [...] "I’ve been playing {{for the last couple}} of years and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> helped my team to go up and, you know, I’m very happy about it and I’m always ready to play".|$|E
2500|$|I have {{a theory}} about what caused her vocal decline, but it's more from {{watching}} her sing than from listening. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was her weight loss that was so dramatic and so quick. It's not the weight loss per se—you know, Deborah Voigt has {{lost a lot of}} weight and still sounds glorious. But if one uses the weight for support, and then it's suddenly gone and one doesn't develop another musculature for support, it can be very hard on the voice. And you can't estimate the toll that emotional turmoil will take as well. I was told, by somebody who knew her well, that the way Callas held her arms to her solar plexus [...] to push and create some kind of support. If she were a Soubrette, it would never have been an issue. But she was singing the most difficult repertoire, the stuff that requires the most stamina, the most strength.|$|E

2500|$|Continuing his {{outstanding}} form in Serie A {{and in the}} Champions League for the 2010–11 campaign, he was pivotal to Inter's attack line. On 16 March 2011, Eto'o gave {{a legendary}} performance in Munich as he helped Inter eliminate Bayern Munich 3–2 (with an aggregate score of 3–3, winning on away goals) in the Champions League. Eto'o scored the first goal after four minutes, and provided two clinical assists to Wesley Sneijder and to Goran Pandev for the winner. After the game, Inter President Massimo Moratti said, [...] "I'm not sure if the deal that brought Eto'o to the club was my best piece of transfer business ever, but <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it</b> was a great piece of business for us. Eto'o is fantastic. I {{do not want to}} take anything away from Ibrahimović, but for everyone it was really a great deal to get Eto'o. Samuel is truly extraordinary." [...] On 29 May, Eto'o scored two goals in the final of the Coppa Italia against Palermo to help Inter win 3–1 and taking his total season goals to 37, a new record high for him.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{heard about}} that," [...] said Eleanor, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> almost wicked {{to talk in}} such a manner. How can we argue about God's power in the other stars from the laws which he has given for our rule in this one?" ...|$|R

5000|$|David Stratton, {{film critic}} for The Movie Show praised Bad Boy Bubby. He awarded the film five stars out of five, remarking, [...] "I <b>really</b> <b>think</b> {{this is one}} of the finest and most {{original}} of all Australian films that I've seen. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> a milestone in Australian cinema".|$|R

5000|$|I've spent a {{fair amount}} of time {{thinking}} about what my aptitude is, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> to explore and push the medium. It's not about breaking gender roles or genre traditions. Kathryn Bigelow in 2009 Bigelow's 1995 film Strange Days was written and produced by her ex-husband James Cameron. Despite some positive reviews, the film was a commercial failure. Furthermore, many attributed the creative vision to James Cameron, diminishing Bigelow's perceived influence on the film.|$|R

6000|$|Charnock stopped him. [...] "No! Perhaps I used excuses, but my {{object is}} not to clear myself." [...] He paused and colored. [...] "We'll admit that Helen lost nothing when I gave her up; but a girl, {{particularly}} a young, romantic girl, feels that kind of thing, and it might hurt worse if {{she thought she had}} loved a wastrel. I want her to feel that I broke my engagement for her sake, when nothing else was possible. That might soften the blow, and <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it's</b> true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} {{extremely}} glad," [...] Mr. Renshaw replied; [...] "though <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> that <b>it</b> is most unfair {{to take you}} even for a moment from your girls after an absence of five years." ...|$|R
50|$|Phil {{asked me}} to arrange the song. <b>I</b> <b>really</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>it</b> should be arranged, because its power is in the {{simplicity}} of the lyric. But he wanted the kitchen sink: Schoenberg, Stravinsky, Cage, electronic sound.|$|R

5000|$|It’s so {{much easier}} to work with {{something}} you’ve written, because you can cut things or add things on the spot. You can be much more at home and at ease with what you do. You don’t feel unfaithful to the writer because there is no writer. Most of the other films I’ve done I’ve co-written, and I prefer it. But having said that, when you work with someone else’s characters, {{you get a lot of}} gifts. You get an entire world, you get to portray people that you couldn’t have made up, and entire worlds that are fascinating because they are not yours. <b>It’s</b> much harder, <b>I</b> <b>really</b> <b>think</b> <b>it’s</b> much harder ...|$|R
