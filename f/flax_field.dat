40|$|Arbuscular {{mycorrhizal}} fungi (AMF) play {{an important}} role in nutrient cycling and growth of flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). However, limited information is available regarding the symbiotic association between flax and AMF in field environments. A study was conducted to survey AMF communities colonizing flax grown in Saskatchewan. Additionally, field and growth chamber studies investigated the impact of AMF inoculation on nutrient uptake and growth of flax. Eighteen commercial <b>flax</b> <b>fields</b> were surveyed to assess mycorrhizal colonization of flax and to assess the impact of agricultural practices and soil abiotic factors on AMF activity. The flax root-associated AMF communities were explored using a 454 sequencing method, together with microscopic-based measurements of root AMF colonization and soil spore density. High levels of root colonization were detected in most <b>flax</b> <b>fields.</b> Of the 222 AMF operational taxonomic units (OTUs) identified in flax roots, 181 OTUs clustered as Funneliformis-Rhizophagus, 19 as Claroideoglomus, 14 as Paraglomus, six as Diversisporales and two as Archaeospora. Results suggest that tillage influenced the composition of AMF communities colonizing flax, and reduced relative AMF abundance and species richness. Additionally, AMF community characteristics were related to soil abiotic factors such as pH, EC, available phosphorus and nitrogen. Field experiments were conducted over two years (two sites per year) using a commercial AMF inoculant applied at three rates (0, 1 X, and 2 X the recommended rate) with or without P fertilizer (16. 8 kg ha- 1). The response of flax cultivars to AMF inoculation was examined in a growth chamber experiment. In addition, 454 sequencing was employed to examine the impact of AMF inoculation on root-associated AMF communities. Under field conditions, only one site showed increased root colonization with AMF inoculation. Flax responded to AMF inoculation differently under different field conditions. At the two sites with intermediate initial soil P level, evidence of increased above-ground biomass and plant nutrient uptake with AMF inoculation was observed. However, such an effect was not detected when P fertilizer was combined with the inoculation. At a low P site and an irrigated site, P application accounted for all of the increases in plant nutrient uptake and biomass of flax, whereas no responses to AMF inoculation were detected. The 454 sequencing revealed different inoculation-induced changes in the diversity and composition of root-associated AMF communities between sites, which was possibly related to different field environments and native AMF communities. In the growth chamber, AMF inoculation resulted in general increases of plant nutrient uptake among cultivars, but only one cultivar showed enhanced biomass with inoculation. The diversity of AMF communities colonizing different flax cultivars was generally reduced by AMF inoculation. Community composition shifted under AMF inoculation, and the shifts appeared to be cultivar specific. These results suggested that benefits of AMF inoculation in flax production are limited and currently not predictable, and the degree of response is likely dependent on a myriad of soil and environmental conditions. ...|$|R

BIRD STUDYVolume: 61 Issue: 1 Pages: 42 - 47 Published: JAN 2 2014 Full Text View Abstract Close Abstract Capsule Skylarks and Yellowhammers generally did not preferentially establish territories in flax relative to autumn-sown crops on lowland farmland. Aims To investigate the biodiversity value of flax using farmland birds as indicator species. Methods Field surveys took place annually between 2009 and 2011 in Northern France, during the breeding season. Fifteen 1 km grid squares were surveyed using a grid-transect method during the periods of greatest avian activity. Territories {{were identified by}} the presence of singing males, which were assigned to crop types. Pairwise habitat comparisons were performed. Results Our results suggest that flax is not universally beneficial for Yellowhammers and Skylarks in our study area. However there were inter-specific differences in its use: Skylarks established more territories in flax than in oilseed rape, ploughed fields or improved grassland, whereas Yellowhammers mostly avoided <b>flax</b> <b>fields</b> in preference for grassland, ploughed fields and barley. Conclusion Overall, Skylarks and Yellowhammers did not preferentially establish territories in flax relative to autumn-sown crops, although some selection for flax by Skylarks was evident. Further work is required to: (a) quantify breeding success in flax relative to other crops and (b) investigate the effect of flax on territory densities of other species...|$|R
50|$|We went {{towards the}} centre of this small island where {{at the foot of}} a round hill a crystal-clear river rushes forth, {{dividing}} up further on into several arms. Towards North and West the hill is covered with the most beautiful ploughed fields all the way down to the sea. The sight of these great <b>flax</b> <b>fields</b> is one of the loveliest I ever beheld. The slender stalks, of the most beautiful green and reaching far above a man’s head, bent in the gentle breeze that blew from the sea. Their red blossoms, shining like rubies, danced in the green waves. The top of the hill and the whole of the south and east sides are covered with enormous pines whose dark green is enhanced by a pleasant foreground of cabbage palms and banana trees, and I also observed a low bush among them the fruit of which resembles our red currants but is much larger and hangs in purple and red clusters that help to give the whole a gay appearance. The dwellings of the colonists are strewn along the fringes of the forest and from my post I could see several of them. Simple houses surrounded by barns and stalls and the fields all enclosed with hedges give the region a youthful appearance the like of which is rarely found in Europe.

40|$|Coexistence allows {{growers and}} {{consumers}} {{the choice of}} producing or purchasing conventional or organic crops with known standards for adventitious presence of genetically engineered (GE) seed. Flax (Linum usitatissimum L.) is multipurpose oilseed crop in which product diversity and utility could be enhanced for industrial, nutraceutical and pharmaceutical markets through genetic engineering. If GE flax were released commercially, pollen-mediated gene flow will determine in part whether GE flax could coexist without compromising other markets. As a part of pre-commercialization risk assessment, we quantified pollen-mediated gene flow between two cultivars of <b>flax.</b> <b>Field</b> experiments were conducted at four locations during 2006 and 2007 in western Canada using a concentric donor (20 × 20 [*]m) receptor (120 × 120 [*]m) design. Gene flow was detected through the xenia effect of dominant alleles of high α-linolenic acid (ALA; 18 : 3 cisΔ 9, 12, 15) to the low ALA trait. Seeds were harvested from the pollen recipient plots up to a distance of 50 [*]m in eight directions from the pollen donor. High ALA seeds were identified using a thiobarbituric acid test {{and served as a}} marker for gene flow. Binomial distribution and power analysis were used to predict the minimum number of seeds statistically required to detect the frequency of gene flow at specific α (confidence interval) and power (1 −β) values. As a result of the low frequency of gene flow, approximately 4 million seeds were screened to derive accurate quantification. Frequency of gene flow was highest near the source: averaging 0. 0185 at 0. 1 [*]m but declined rapidly with distance, 0. 0013 and 0. 00003 at 3 and 35 [*]m, respectively. Gene flow was reduced to 50 % (O 50) and 90 % (O 90) between 0. 85 to 2. 64 [*]m, and 5. 68 to 17. 56 [*]m, respectively. No gene flow was detected at any site or year > 35 [*]m distance from the pollen source, suggesting that frequency of gene flow was ⩽ 0. 00003 (P= 0. 95). Although {{it is not possible to}} eliminate all adventitious presence caused by pollen-mediated gene flow, through harvest blending and the use of buffer zones between GE and conventional flax fields, it could be minimized. Managing other sources of adventitious presence including seed mixing and volunteer populations may be more problematic...|$|E
50|$|The {{plant is}} pulled {{up with the}} roots (not cut), so as to {{increase}} the fiber length. After this, the flax is allowed to dry, the seeds are removed, and it is then retted. Dependent upon climatic conditions, characteristics of the sown <b>flax</b> and <b>fields,</b> the <b>flax</b> remains on the ground between two weeks and two months for retting. As a result of alternating rain and the sun, an enzymatic action degrades the pectins which bind fibers to the straw. The farmers turn over the straw during retting to evenly rett the stalks.

40|$|Camelina [Camelina sativa (L.) Crtz. ] is {{an ancient}} crop {{belonging}} to the Brassicaceae family. It has been cultivated for oil production since prehistoric times, and it was extensively grown in Europe in the 19 th century. However, Camelina fell into disfavor when more productive crops such as wheat and rapeseed began to be produced, and camelina production gradually declined and almost vanished after World War II. It became a common weed in Europe known as false <b>flax</b> (contaminating <b>flax</b> <b>fields)</b> and by its Roman name, Gold-of-Pleasure. The recent interests in camelina are inspired by its unique oil composition. About 90 % of fatty acids in camelina oil is unsaturated. The nutritionally essential polyunsaturated fatty acids (linoleic acid, 18 : 2 n- 6 and α-linolenic acid, 18 : 3 n- 3) constitute over 50 % of total fatty acids, and linolenic acid is the most predominant fatty acid (35 - 40 %). Therefore camelina oil has great potential as {{an excellent source of}} omega- 3 fatty acids 1, which have been recommended in the diet to achieve essentiality and cardiovascular benefits. Non-food uses of camelina oil have also been exploited for the production of soaps, varnishes, and cosmetics 2, 3. Because camelina has lower fertilizer and pesticide requirements, the production cost is substantially lower than many other oil crops such as rapeseed, corn, and soybean; therefore camelina is an attractive potential crop for biodiesel and many other industrial applications 2. Currently, the lack of a clear utilization pattern of camelina oil limits its uses and large-scale production despite its adaptation {{to a wide range of}} climates 2.

40|$|Bellbirds (Anthornis melanura) {{are one of}} two endemic {{honeyeaters}} in New Zealand. They {{are still}} common {{in many parts of}} the country, but also rare and absent in some areas where they were abundant before. Together with tui (Prosthemadera novaeseelandia) bellbirds are responsible for avian pollination of several native plants in New Zealand. Habitat fragmentation and geographical constraints prevent bellbirds from re-occupying formerly inhabited areas. After translocations birds often disperse; some just disappear, some are thought to fly back to their source site and probably many die. Supplementary feeding provides energy rich food, which helps to ensure birds are well-nourished until they can discover natural food sources at the release sites. Conspecific song playback as an attractant for many bird species can be used as public information about high habitat value and additionally lure birds to good food sources and nest sites. Artificial feeding stations were set up at 18 locations in Kennedy's Bush, Port Hills, Canterbury, New Zealand. Feeders filled with sugar water were available for five to six consecutive days and during observation hours the effect of song playback was tested. Variation in bird numbers resulting from experimental treatments was recorded using five-minute bird counts prior to treatments and additional counts every minute of observation time. Bellbird numbers varied strongly with habitat types, showing highest numbers for dense and tall bush areas and close to creeks and lowest for open areas besides pasture and in post-flowering <b>flax</b> <b>fields.</b> Bellbird numbers increased when song was broadcast, with the strongest effect in areas where bellbird numbers were moderate or low, but not in areas where bellbirds were absent. Feeding stations were not observed to be used by bellbirds. The strong response in bellbird numbers to conspecific song playback proved the attractiveness of song for bellbirds. Nevertheless, its function as a lure for bellbirds to artificial feeding stations was not shown. This contrasting result indicates that the use of bellbird song as an enticement for bellbirds has to be investigated further...|$|R

40|$|CDATA[This {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of graded levels of Linpro (an extruded product produced using a 50 : 50 combination of full-fat <b>flax</b> seed and <b>field</b> peas) on broiler performance and nutrient digestibility. A total of 150, two-day old, male broiler chicks (Ross- 308 line; Lilydale Hatchery, Wynyard, Saskatchewan) weighing an average of 62. 6 ? 0. 6 g were randomly assigned to one of five dietary treatments. The control diet was based on wheat and soybean meal while the experimental diets contained 5, 10, 15 or 25 % Linpro added at the expense of wheat and soybean meal. Digestibility coefficients for dry matter and gross energy declined in a linear manner (P= 0. 001) with increasing levels of Linpro in the diet. Digestibility coefficients for crude protein exhibited a cubic (P= 0. 019) effect due to Linpro incorporation. There were no significant differences in weight gain or feed intake due to the incorporation of Linpro in the diet. Feed conversion declined in a linear manner (P= 0. 01) as the level of Linpro in the diet increased. The overall results of this experiment indicate that Linpro (extruded full-fat flax seed and peas) can be fed at levels as high as 25 % of the diet without significantly affecting growth rate while depressing feed conversion to a lesser extent than has been reported for untreated flax seed and peas. Therefore, use of this product may provide poultry producers with a mechanism to alter the fatty acid composition of poultry meat without dramatic reductions in performance since feeding full-fat flax seed to poultry has been shown to significantly increase the incorporation of omega- 3 fatty acids into carcass tissues. ]]...|$|R
40|$|Finding the {{alternate}} biofuel feedstock(s) {{in addition to}} and/or replacement of traditional soybean feedstock is necessary to meet the future demand of biofuels. Two field studies were conducted in diverse environments in Texas during 2007 - 2011 to evaluate the yield, adaptation, and oil content of 4 cool-season crop species (rapeseed, safflower, flax, and camelina). In addition to the evaluation of yield and adaptation in these cool-season crops, two more studies were conducted during 2009 - 2011 to study <b>flax</b> yield components (<b>field</b> study) {{and the effect of}} vernalization and photoperiod on flowering of flax (growth chamber study). Out of two field studies conducted in Texas, the evaluation of four cool-season crops was designed as a randomized complete block with fifty-one genotypes (four species) and three replications in nine locations across the Texas. In addition to the evaluation of cool-season crops, an exclusive replicated study was conducted in flax to evaluate 20 genotypes for the yield, adaptation, and association between yield and its components in three locations in South Texas. Additionally, a growth chamber study was setup as a split-split plot design with twenty genotypes, two vernalized treatments (vernalized and unvernalized), and two photoperiods (10 hours and 14 hours). Spring rapeseed (canola) and safflower were the highest yielding crops with a maximum yield of 1372 kg ha- 1 and 1240 kg ha- 1, respectively. In South and Central Texas, fall - seeded flax yield averaged 1075 kg ha^- 1 with a mean oil content of 38. 3 %. The flax genotype evaluation in Southeast Texas suggested that all genotypes developed in Texas showed relative cold tolerance compared to genotypes developed in other locations. A cross between Caldwell / Dillman (Texas genotype) was highly adapted to the environments of southeast Texas. Nekoma and York (genotypes developed in North Dakota) yielded well in non-cold years (> - 2 degrees C) in College Station. Overall, flax is well adapted to growth in the area surrounding College Station, TX. The results of association of yield and its components in flax suggest that tiller number was the most significant contributing factor (p< 0. 05) affecting yield of flax in all three locations. However, the effect of tiller number was almost negated by the effect of pods per tiller (compensatory) in two out of three locations. The effect of vernalization and photoperiod on flowering of 20 genotypes of flax suggested that Texas genotypes delayed anthesis for 7 days or more in non-vernalized seedlings. These genotypes also delayed anthesis for 12 days or more in vernalized and short day conditions compared to vernalized and long day conditions. In summary, the spring rapeseed in diverse environments of Texas and fall-planted flax in South Texas showed promising yield and adaptation. Selection for more productive tiller number and intrinsic earliness of flowering to reduce the time of maturation would benefit the flax yields in Southeast Texas. Safflower was widely adapted to Texas and with increased oil content could have potential to the biofuel industry in Texas...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to find out whether {{utilization}} of arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM), in crop production in Nordic conditions, can be promoted through management of the cropping system. P fertilization was chosen as the pilot system to manage because it has a major effect on AM and because it is problematic from the viewpoint of sustainability. Our scant knowledge of AM functioning and its effects in the field is mainly due to the methodological problems of research. Therefore, a bioassay of AM effectiviness was developed. In addition, the work demonstrated the challenge of a systems approach to research on low organizational levels of the agroecosystem. The starting point was the goal of sustainable phosphorus management in the food system, focused down to the AM level. The conclusions were then linked back to the context of the target suprasystem. The study demonstrated thet, even in research at lower system levels, choices are made regarding the degree of systemism, and the soft dimension of systems approach is also relevant. The higher system level of interest affects the approach to be taken in research on the subsystems, and it is important that the conclusions are related to the system level considered. Representative results for AM infectivity and effectiviness in field soils were obtained in a bioassay involving sampling of the field soil in the spring, after the thaw, and creating a control with suppressed AM through the incorporation of 20 mg(/kg soil in target moisture) benomyl in the soil immediately before sowing. Flax proved to be an appropriate test plant together with a relevant host. This bioassay also allows standardization for the practical purpose improving the prediction of field soil P availability and its problems, especially in sustainable agriculture. Understanding the interrelations of the tripartite system of mycorrhiza encompassing plant, soil and AMF is a prerequisite for management of AM. The influence of P on AM formation and effectiviness in terms of growth and nutrient uptake of barley, red clover and flax was investigated. As well, the effect of P on the size, composition and functioning of the field AMF communities was clarified. The impact of the P history on P response and the immediate effect of omitting P application and halving N fertilization were elucidated with <b>flax.</b> Two long-term <b>field</b> experiments representing contrasting soil types with low and intermediate contents of extractable P were utilized. Besides the bioassay for AM effectiviness developed, two other bioassays and a field assay were employed. A conceptual model of the impact of P on AM effectiviness was presented. P fertilization consistently decreased AMF infectivity and generally AM effectiviness, too. Cumulative P fertilization decreased the size of the AMF communities but did not affect the hyphal P transport capacity, or, in contrast to some other studies, the species composition. Instead, functional intraspecific adaptation of the AMF communities to extreme P conditions was observed. However, the mode of action of cumulative P fertilization of major practical importance was the change in the soil conditions in which the AMF functioned. In some cases the restriction on contribution of AM to crop growth and nutrient uptake in the field seemed to be a low rate of mycorrhization due to incompatibility of the plant with the soil P status or with the AMF community evolved. Most often, however, the benefit appeared to be limited by plant and soil factors which cause AM to be a net cost. AM appears to be an ecosystem service that is impaired or lost by intensive cultivation. In soil representing the present lower end of the P supply of Finland's field soils, but the average status of the late sixties, the higher AM effectiviness in soil with no added P for 20 years compensated the annual P fertilization of 45 kg/ha(soil PH 20 2. 5 v. 9. 5 mg/kg) for flax. The compensation was not complete for red clover. In contrast to July, at harvest barley received no benefit from AM and only a slight benefit from cumulated P. The management benefit, or increase in relative contribution of AM to growth by omitting the annual P fertilizations of 45 kg/ha, was in the low P soil, for flax, 30...|$|R
