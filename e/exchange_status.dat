40|$|The {{claim that}} {{marriage}} is a venue for <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> of achieved traits, like education, and ascribed attributes, notably race and ethnic membership, has regained traction in the social stratifi cation literature. Most studies that consider <b>status</b> <b>exchanges</b> ignore birthplace as a social boundary for <b>status</b> <b>exchanges</b> via couple formation. This paper evaluates the <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> hypothesis for Australia and the United States, two Anglophone nations with long immigration traditions whose admission regimes place diff erent emphases on skills. A log-linear analysis reveals evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> in the United States among immigrants {{with lower levels of}} education and mixed nativity couples with foreign-born husbands. Partly because Australian educational boundaries are less sharply demarcated at the postsecondary level, we fi nd weaker evidence for the <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> hypothesis.

40|$|<b>Status</b> <b>exchange</b> {{theory has}} long held a central {{position}} {{in the study of}} interracial marriage between blacks and whites. Originally proposed by both Merton (1941) and Davis (1941) indepen-dently, <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> theory predicts that interracial unions between blacks and whites will often involve an <b>exchange</b> of racial <b>status</b> for some other status characteristic, generally operationalized in research as education. Because whites may see marrying across racial lines as marrying “down-ward”, they must be compensated by marrying up on some other dimension. Therefore, <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> theory predicts that whites in interracial marriages will be more upwardly mobile (hy-pergamous) and less downwardly mobile (hypogamous) in terms of education than if they were in a racially endogamous marriage. The opposite would be true for blacks in an interracial marriage. Although an early generation of scholars in the 1960 s and 1970 s found little evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> using simple models, a more recent generation of scholars has found significant evidence of <b>status</b> <b>exchange,</b> using more sophisticated approaches that address the shortcomings of earlier research.

40|$|Abstract—One-hop {{broadcasting}} is the predominate form {{of network}} traffic in VANETs. <b>Exchanging</b> <b>status</b> information by broadcasting among the vehicles enhances vehicular active safety. Since {{there is no}} MAC layer broadcasting recovery for 802. 11 based VANETs, efforts should be made towards more robust and effective transmission of such safety-related infor-mation. In this paper, a channel adaptive broadcasting method is proposed. It relies solely on channel condition information available at each vehicle by employing standard supported sequence number mechanisms. The proposed method is fully compatible with 802. 11 and introduces no communication overhead. Simulation studies show that it outperforms standard broadcasting in term of reception rate and channel utilization. I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The ever growing {{complexity}} of modern data centers for cloud computing- mainly {{due to the}} increasing number of users and their augmenting requests for resources-is pushing the need for new approaches to cloud infrastructure management. In order to face this new complexity challenge, many organizations have been exploring the possibility of providing the cloud infrastructure with an autonomic behavior, i. e., the ability to take decisions about virtual machine (VM) management across the datacenter’s physical nodes without human intervention. While many of these solutions are intrinsically centralized and suffer of scalability and reliability problems, we investigate the possibility to provide the cloud with a decentralized self-organizing behavior. We present a novel migration policy with a twofold goal: saving energy (by putting in sleep mode the underutilized nodes of the datacenter), while keeping the load balanced across the working physical machines. Our migration policy is suitable for a distributed environment, where hosts can <b>exchange</b> <b>status</b> information with each other according to a predefined protocol. We evaluate the performance of the approach by means of an ad hoc built simulator. As we expected, although our distributed implementation cannot perform as good as a centralized management, it can significantly contribute to augment the degree of scalability of a cloud infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|The {{continued}} miniaturization in computing {{and wireless}} communication {{is about to}} make informationally enhanced environments become a reality. Already today, devices like a notebook computer or a personal digital assistent (PDA) can easily connect to the Internet via IEEE 802. 11 networks (WaveLAN) or similar technologies provided at so-called hot-spots. In the near future, even smaller devices can join a wireless network to <b>exchange</b> <b>status</b> information or send and receive commands. In this paper, we present sample uses of a generic Bluetooth component that we have developed {{and that has been}} successfully integrated into various mininature devices to transmit sensor data or exchange control commands. The use of standard protocols like TCP/IP, Obex, and HTTP simplifies the use of those devices with conventional devices (notebook, PDA, cell-phone) without even requiring special drivers or applications for these devices. While such scenarios have already often been dreamt of, we are able to present a working solution based on small and cost-effective standard elements. We describe two applications that illustrate the power this approach in the broad area of e-commerce, e-learning, and e-government: the BlueWand, a small, pen-like device that can control Bluetooth devices in its vincinity by simple gestures, and a door plate that can display messages that are posted to it e. g. by a Bluetooth PDA.

30|$|Vehicular ad hoc {{networks}} (VANET) provide local vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V 2 I) communications {{to support}} intelligent transportations systems (ITS) applications. Example applications are emergency electronic brake lights, slow vehicle indication, wrong way driver warning, stationary vehicle warning, lane change assistance, etc. The technology used to enable such ad hoc networking is called IEEE 802.11 p [1]. This is {{an amendment to}} the IEEE 802.11 standard that contains several enhancements to improve performance under vehicular conditions. Examples are an increased output power, dedicated channel, and reduced channel bandwidth to account for the influence of Doppler spread. In contrast with other ad hoc networking use cases, VANET communication in general does not focus on unicast transmissions. Instead, the emphasis is put on the dissemination of information to all nodes located in a certain region. Typically, this functionality is achieved by combining media access control (MAC) level broadcasting with geographic-aware forwarding schemes on the networking layer. In general, two different kinds of information messages are used: cooperative awareness messages (CAM) [2] and decentralized environmental notification messages (DENM) [3]. The former is utilized to continuously <b>exchange</b> <b>status</b> information such as location, heading, and speed with the other vehicles in the immediate environment. Hence, CAM beacons are restricted to single-hop broadcasts. The latter is applied when some specific piece of information regarding the environment, e.g., tail of traffic jam, slippery spot, obstacle on the road, etc. is to be communicated to all vehicles within a given area. Therefore, DENM messages are multi-hop broadcasted in the VANET.|$|E

40|$|Rates of {{black-white}} intermarriage in the United States {{have increased}} over the last sixty years, yet they remain at levels below other types of interracial/interethnic unions. Prior research has centered largely on individual-level factors associated {{with the formation of}} such unions, culminating in three not entirely consistent micro-level theories: status-caste <b>exchange,</b> <b>status</b> homogamy, and educational/economic success. Most of this literature does not consider contextual-level characteristics, which I argue should have an independent effect on the incidence of these unions. My dissertation explores these issues with microlevel and multilevel models using data from the 2006 American Community Survey. I examine both micro and macro level predictors of the odds of white women marrying black men, and black women marrying white men in the metropolitan areas of the U. S. in 2006. In my level one analyses, six logistic regression equations are estimated to test the efficacy of the abovementioned microlevel theories of interracial marriage for black and white women. Status-caste exchange theory is accorded no support from my investigation, and status homogamy theory receives inconsistent support for white women. The results clearly convey that educational/economic success theory is applicable for predicting intermarriage among white and black metropolitan women in the United States. Among white women, those with high occupational status and high annual income {{are more likely to be}} intermarried than those with low occupational status and lower income. Among black metropolitan women, those with high occupational status and high levels of education are more likely to be intermarried than those with low occupational status and low levels of education. In my multilevel analyses, four hierarchical generalized linear models are estimated to evaluate the likelihood of intermarriage for white and black women living in metropolitan areas in the United States. My results show that context matters in predicting and understanding intermarriage for both groups of women. Both the individual-level characteristics of the women, as well as the contextual-level characteristics of their metropolitan areas, were shown in my equations to impact their likelihood of being intermarried. Future research would benefit from the inclusion of social context in any consideration of intermarriage, particularly through the use of multilevel modeling, which until now, has not been utilized by researchers in this area...|$|E
40|$|We {{characterized}} the physical/chemical {{conditions and the}} algal and bacterial assemblages in ballast water from 62 ballast tanks aboard 28 ships operated by the U. S. Military Sealift Command and the Maritime Administration, sampled at 9 ports on the U. S. West Coast and 4 ports on the U. S. East Coast. The ballast tank waters had been held for 2 – 176 days, and 90 % of the tanks had undergone ballast exchange with open ocean waters. Phytoplankton abundance was highly variable (grand mean for all tanks, 3. 21 × 104 viable cells m− 3; median, 7. 9 × 103 cells m− 3) and was unrelated to physical/chemical parameters, except for {{a positive relationship between}} centric diatom abundance and nitrate concentration. A total of 100 phytoplankton species were identified from the ballast tanks, including 23 potentially harmful taxa (e. g. Chaetoceros concavicornis, Dinophysis acuminata, Gambierdiscus toxicus, Heterosigma akashiwo, Karlodinium veneficum, Prorocentrum minimum, Pseudo-nitzschia multiseries). Assemblages were dominated by chain-forming diatoms and dinoflagellates, and viable organisms comprised about half of the total cells. Species richness was higher in ballast tanks with coastal water, and in tanks containing Atlantic or Pacific Ocean source waters rather than Indian Ocean water. Total and viable phytoplankton numbers decreased with age of water in the tanks. Diversity also generally decreased with water age, and tanks with ballast water age > 33 days did not produce culturable phytoplankton. Abundance was significantly higher in tanks with recently added coastal water than in tanks without coastal sources, but highly variable in waters held less than 30 days. Bacterial abundance was significantly lower in ballast tanks with Atlantic than Pacific Ocean source water, but otherwise was surprisingly consistent among ballast tanks (overall mean across all tanks, 3. 13 ± 1. 27 × 1011 cells m− 3; median, 2. 79 × 1011 cells m− 3) and was unrelated to vessel type, <b>exchange</b> <b>status,</b> age of water, environmental conditions measured, or phytoplankton abundance. At least one of four pathogenic eubacteria (Listeria monocytogenes, Escherichia coli, Mycobacterium spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa) was detected in 48 % of the ballast tanks, but toxigenic strains of Vibrio cholerae were not detected. For ships with tanks of similar ballasting history, the largest source of variation in phytoplankton and bacteria abundance was among ships; for ships with tanks of differing ballasting histories, and for all ships/tanks considered collectively, the largest source of variation was within ships. Significant differences in phytoplankton abundance, but not bacterial abundance, sometimes occurred between paired tanks with similar ballasting history; hence, for regulatory purposes phytoplankton abundance cannot be estimated from single tanks only. Most tanks (94 %) had adequate records to determine the source locations and age of the ballast water and, as mentioned, 90 % had had ballast exchange with open-ocean waters. Although additional data are needed from sediments that can accumulate at the bottom of ballast tanks, the data from this water-column study indicate that in general, U. S. Department of Defense (DoD) ships are well managed to minimize the risk for introduction of harmful microbiota. Nevertheless, abundances of viable phytoplankton with maximum dimension > 50 μm exceeded proposed International Maritime Organization standards in 47 % of the ballast tanks sampled. The data suggest that further treatment technologies and/or alternative management strategies will be necessary to enable DoD vessels to comply with proposed standards...|$|E

Thus, I argue that this suggests little, if any, evidence for the <b>status</b> <b>exchange</b> hypothesis. Furthermore, the evidence strongly indicates that there is a remarkable consistency and symmetry in husband/wife educational attainment regardless of race (with the possible exception of white/white marriages); intermarried couples share a similar level of education, and educational homogamy dominates the educational marriages, no matter how strong the racial endogamy is...|$|R
