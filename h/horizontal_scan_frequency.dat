50|$|NTSC {{uses this}} process unmodified. Unfortunately, this {{often results in}} poor color {{reproduction}} due to phase errors in the received signal, caused sometimes by multipath, but mostly by poor implementation at the studio end. With the advent of solid state receivers, cable TV, and digital studio equipment for conversion to an over-the-air analog signal, these NTSC problems have been largely fixed, leaving operator error at the studio end as the sole color rendition weakness of the NTSC system. In any case, the PAL D (delay) system mostly corrects these kind of errors by reversing the phase of the signal on each successive line, and the averaging the results over pairs of lines. This process is achieved {{by the use of}} a 1H (where H = <b>horizontal</b> <b>scan</b> <b>frequency)</b> duration delay line. (A typical circuit used with this device converts the low frequency color signal to ultrasound and back again). Phase shift errors between successive lines are therefore cancelled out and the wanted signal amplitude is increased when the two in-phase (coincident) signals are re-combined.|$|E

The position of the beam has been tracked using a separate position sensitive detector.

In the simplified configuration, faster scanning micromirror with <b>horizontal</b> <b>scan</b> <b>frequency</b> of 28.8  kHz has been used to increase the resolution and position sensitive detector has been removed from the system by synchronizing the driving current waveform with the avalanche photodiode signals.

40|$|We present two {{designs of}} {{two-dimensional}} gimbal microscanners with low vertical-scan frequencies of 70 Hz and 330 Hz {{and a high}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>scan</b> <b>frequency</b> of 30 kHz.

The backside structure under the frame increases the frame wt. and effectively reduces the resonant frequency of the rotation springs. The slow vertical scan can thus be achieved without reducing the spring width dramatically. A patterned backside structure also reinforces the mirror plate during actuation such that the root-mean-square dynamic deformation of the 1 mm diam. mirror is less than 44 nm (l/ 10 for blue) at 10 degrees mech. scan angle.

Both electrother-mal and electromagnetic (EM) actuations have been integrated in the same device for slow and fast scanning purposes, respectively. The added advantage of a CMOS-compatible fabrication process allows our device to be monolithically integrated with CMOS integrated circuits. Optical deflection angles of ± 1. 5 ◦ for a 74 -Hz vertical scan at 12 mW by electrothermal actuation and ± 10 ◦ for a <b>horizontal</b> <b>scan</b> <b>frequency</b> of 202 Hz at 1. 26 mA and 1 Vac by EM actuation are reported.

40|$|Abstract. Electromagnetic optical {{scanning}} mirrors for both <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>scanning</b> of a Laser Projection Display have been proposed. Electromagnetic actuation is selected {{because of the}} millimeter-sized mirror. For low cost reason, the glass and PMMA films are respectively used as the main structure of <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>scanning</b> mirrors. A mathematical model considering the operation frequency of the Laser Projection Display has been derived to fast design the geometry of the scanning mirror. In order to machine scanning mirrors with high quality geometry, the 193 nm excimer laser is used as the major machine tool. Different control circuits {{have been developed to}} control both <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>scanning.</b> The <b>scanning</b> <b>frequencies,</b> 4. 15 kHz and 260 Hz respectively for <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>scanning</b> mirrors, have been measured by laser Doppler vibrometer. Comparing to other optical scanners, 193 nm excimer laser machined {{optical scanning}} mirrors have advantages in low cost and easy to fabricate. In this paper, a Laser Projection Display consisting of the <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>scanning</b> mirrors has also been built to show the application potential.

40|$|APPLICATION NOTE This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} a low−cost 90 W flyback switching power supply for a multi−sync color monitor. In order to minimize the screen interference from the switching noise, the power supply can be automatically synchronized at the fixed <b>frequency</b> of the <b>horizontal</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> (15 to 32 kHz) of the color monitor. The line and load regulations of the power supply are excellent. Also, a new universal input−voltage adaptor enables the power supply to operate at two input voltage ranges, 90 − 130 Vac or 180 − 260 Vac. It can minimize the ripple current requirement of the input bulk capacitors and the stresses on the power switch. The design demonstrates how to use recently introduced components in a low−cost power supply. The state−of−the−art perforated emitter epi−collector bipolar power transistor MJE 18004 and opto−isolator MOC 8102 are utilized. 1...|$|R

40|$|A high {{performance}} micro scanner {{is a critical}} element to enable efficient beamsteering in miniature laser projection displays. Such scanner requires a large mirror size, large scan angles, and a high frequency to ensure good optical resolutions. However, these conditions also induce large dynamic deformations on the mirror plate, resulting in optical aberrations. This dissertation describes a new design of two-dimensional micro scanner with good dynamic atness. The design targeted to achieve a resolution analogue to VGA video requirements (640 pixels x 480 pixels) with a modulation transfer function (MTF) value of 0. 5. Another portion of the dissertation {{is dedicated to the}} fracture strength investigations of single crystal silicon torsion springs. The fracture strength knowledge will contribute to the design of a reliable micro scanner under high frequency, large angle actuation conditions. The demonstrated two-dimensional micro scanner has a high <b>horizontal</b> <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> of 30. 84 kHz and a low vertical <b>scanning</b> <b>frequency</b> of 335 Hz. It has two special features to enhance the mirror plate atness: 1. the backside islands to increase rigidity and 2. the multiple-joint torsion springs to evenly distribute forces onto the mirror plate. A novel DRIE-TMAH combination process was developed to fabricate the backside islands with an average height of 86 um and > 96 % within-wafer uniformity. When operated with a mechanical scan angle of 4. 8 °, the 1 mm diameter mirror plate had a root-mean-square dynamic deformation of 13. 86 nm. This translates to a 25 nm deformation at +- 10 °, which is less than 1 / 20 wavelength of the 635 nm light source. The MTF of the scanner was calculated based on the deformations and proved the scanner's ability to achieve a VGA resolution with 0. 5 MTF. Another part of the dissertation documents the findings of the fractures strength experiments performed with single crystal silicon torsion springs. Three types of specimens with different sizes and stress distributions were fabricated for the experiments. The specimens were actuated to different angles to determine the stress levels at which the springs fracture. Fitting the fractures stress data with a two-parameter Weibull distribution function, the characteristic stresses of the three specimen types were found to be 3. 10 GPa, 2. 51 GPa, and 4. 76 GPa. Among them, the design with the highest stress concentration and lowest surface roughness exhibits the highest fracture strength. This indicates a high stress concentration to be desirable for torsion spring designs. A normalized characteristic stress was implemented to attempt the fracture strength prediction of a new device. However, the analyses demonstrated such predictions to be unreliable if the surface condition of the new device is {{different from that of the}} known and tested specimens...|$|R

In the text mode, which the Hercules card reverted to when the PC was reset, it was almost exactly like the IBM MDA and could be treated by software as if it was an MDA. For full MDA compatibility, thr HGC used a 6845 CRT controller (CRTC) chip like the one found on the MDA. The HGC was so compatible with the MDA in this regard that it did not provide its own BIOS ROM and was recognized and operated by the standard PC system board BIOS as an MDA.|$|R
