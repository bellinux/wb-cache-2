5|$|The IMF has {{reported}} that the global financial system is on a path to improved financial stability, but faces a host of transitional challenges borne out by regional vulnerabilities and policy regimes. One challenge is managing the United States' disengagement from its accommodative monetary policy. Doing so in an elegant, orderly manner could be difficult as markets adjust to reflect investors' expectations of a new monetary regime with <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> Interest rates could rise too sharply if exacerbated by a structural decline in market liquidity from <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and greater volatility, or by structural deleveraging in short-term securities and in the shadow banking system (particularly the mortgage market and real estate investment trusts). Other central banks are contemplating ways to exit unconventional monetary policies employed in recent years. Some nations however, such as Japan, are attempting stimulus programs at larger scales to combat deflationary pressures. The Eurozone's nations implemented myriad national reforms aimed at strengthening the monetary union and alleviating stress on banks and governments. Yet some European nations such as Portugal, Italy, and Spain continue to struggle with heavily leveraged corporate sectors and fragmented financial markets in which investors face pricing inefficiency and difficulty identifying quality assets. Banks operating in such environments may need stronger provisions in place to withstand corresponding market adjustments and absorb potential losses. Emerging market economies face challenges to greater stability as bond markets indicate heightened sensitivity to monetary easing from external investors flooding into domestic markets, rendering exposure to potential capital flights brought on by heavy corporate leveraging in expansionary credit environments. Policymakers in these economies are tasked with transitioning to more sustainable and balanced financial sectors while still fostering market growth {{so as not to}} provoke investor withdrawal.|$|E

40|$|There {{has been}} a lively debate whether <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> were {{effective}} in stabilizing the exchange rate {{in the wake of}} the Asian currency crisis. Many economists insist that <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> not only failed to stabilize the Korean won, but also exacerbated the crisis itself. This paper tries to shed light on this problem by providing empirical evidence from the <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> period. (1997. 12. 3 ? 1998. 4. 8) If possible channels whereby <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> may affect exchange rates are examined, the <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> policy scores well. It accommodated net capital inflow by satisfying the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> parity condition. Also it helped rebuild credibility of the policy stance. While the negative impact of <b>high</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> on the private sector cannot be denied, the role of credit crunch needs to be recognized together. Next, the dynamic interaction between <b>interest</b> <b>rates</b> and exchange rates is analyzed using a vector error correction model composed of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> differential, spot and forward exchange rates, and country risk premium. The estimation result shows that a 10 % point rise in domestic <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> appreciates the Korean won by 25 %. In addition, the country risk premium considerably falls down.

5|$|Following {{research}} of systemic crises that plagued developing countries throughout the 1990s, economists {{have reached a}} consensus that liberalization of capital flows carries important prerequisites if these countries are to observe the benefits offered by financial globalization. Such conditions include stable macroeconomic policies, healthy fiscal policy, robust bank regulations, and strong legal protection of property rights. Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign direct investment, liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at <b>higher</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rates,</b> and accelerated economic growth.
