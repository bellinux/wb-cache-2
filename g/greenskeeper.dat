25|$|In later interviews, McCormack listed five {{attributes}} that made Palmer especially marketable: his good looks; his relatively modest background (his {{father was a}} <b>greenskeeper</b> before rising to be club professional and Latrobe was a humble club); the way he played golf, taking risks and wearing his emotions on his sleeve; his involvement {{in a string of}} exciting finishes in early televised tournaments; and his affability.|$|E
25|$|Hurdzan's {{father was}} a caddie who taught himself how to play golf, and tried unsuccessfully {{to play on the}} PGA Tour before {{becoming}} a golf instructor; he taught at Beacon Light Golf Course in Columbus, which was owned then by golf course architect Jack Kidwell who later became Hurdzan's influence, {{a past president of the}} ASGCA and an inductee of the Ohio Historical Society. Like his father, during his elementary school years, Hurdzan started as a caddie; he later became Kidwell's <b>greenskeeper</b> at the age of 13.|$|E

In 1891 George Wright captained the Longwood Cricket Club against Lord Hawke's visiting English side. Wright's side surprised the visiting English first-class players with accurate bowling which kept the tourist in check. In 1892 George Wright donated cricket gear to British Guianese (Guyana) cricket players thereby starting a century old tradition of West Indian cricket in New England.|$|E

25|$|In April 1900, {{surveyors}} {{began studying}} {{part of the}} park as a possible location for a golf course. Later that month, workers began construction at the northwest course location. It was expected that the course would open in June or July of that year, but that the work would not be fully complete until September. New York City <b>greenskeeper</b> Val Flood later stated that he thought the course would open by August; however, by September 1900, work on the course had hardly started {{due to a lack}} of workers. By the end of 1900, NYC Parks reported that seeds had been planted for nine greens, and two bunkers and one hazard had been created. The course opened in 1901, but did not gain popularity until 1903 when overcrowding at the Van Cortlandt course drove players to use the less crowded Pelham Bay course instead.|$|E

2500|$|Born in Urbana, Ohio, {{his parents}} were Paul F. [...] "Pink" [...] and Elizabeth Dye. A few years before Dye's birth, his father got hooked on golf and built a nine-hole course on family land in Champaign County called the [...] "Urbana Country Club." [...] As a youngster, he worked and played that course, won the Ohio state high school golf championship, and medaled in the state amateur golf championship, all before {{entering}} the U.S. Army at age 18 in 1944 during World War II.

Glenn Danzig rejected their offer to return as the band's lead singer. Dave Vanian of The Damned was also approached but declined. The band, now reformed with one [...] original founding member, Jerry Only, held open auditions for a new vocalist. Nineteen-year-old singer Michael Emanuel had recently recorded a demo tape in hopes of starting a music career, and the owner of the recording studio suggested that he audition for the Misfits. Being unfamiliar with the band, Emanuel listened to Collection I on a walkman to learn the lyrics and melodies while working his job as a <b>greenskeeper.</b> He impressed the band with his audition and was accepted as the new lead singer under the pseudonym Michale Graves, while Doyle adopted the new stage name [...] "Doyle Wolfgang von Frankenstein".

5000|$|Almost every {{golf course}} is {{measured}} and rated according to yards/distance. Because of this, {{it is wise}} to keep the accumulative yardage for daily play close to the rating for the course. There is no total number of yards to guide <b>greenskeepers</b> for each day's moving of the pins. It's a judgement call, an estimation.|$|R

50|$|Never hit a ball {{onto the}} green when a <b>greenskeeper</b> is there unless they clearly motion {{for you to}} do so. Generally, golfers have the right of way on a golf course, and workers will wait or yield to players. But if a <b>greenskeeper</b> is on the green, and the pin is out, they have the right of way.|$|E
5000|$|Placing pins {{is done by}} [...] "feel" [...] and experience. Typically, a <b>greenskeeper</b> {{lets the}} weight of the cup cutting tool dangle so that gravity makes it {{vertical}} and plumb. Then the <b>greenskeeper</b> twists the handles to slice the round cutting cylinder into the green while trying to keep the tool in a vertical position. After the tool cuts in, it lifts a cylindrical core out of the new hole. This core of soil is saved to repair the old or previous hole after the cup is snagged and lifted out. Once the old hole is plugged with the soil and turf core, the <b>greenskeeper</b> places the cup into the new hole.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, the <b>greenskeeper</b> {{that sets}} the greens pins also moves and sets the tee markers. The tee markers are the pieces stuck in the ground that mark the line from which to tee-off or strike the golf ball.
