5|$|Foreign direct {{investment}} (FDI) was $8.3 billion in 2012, a figure <b>expected</b> <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> to $15 billion in 2013. In 2012, Fitch Group upgraded Turkey's credit rating to investment grade after an 18-year gap; {{this was followed}} by a ratings upgrade by Moody's in May 2013, as the service lifted Turkey's government bond ratings to the lowest investment grade Baa3. In September 2016, Moody's cut Turkey's sovereign debt to junk status. In the economic crisis of 2016 it emerged that the huge debts incurred for investment during the Justice and Development Party (AKP) government since 2002 had mostly been consumed in construction, rather than invested in sustainable economic growth. Private bank debts in Turkey were 6.6 billion TL in 2002 and had increased to 385 billion TL by the end of 2015.|$|E

40|$|I compare {{unemployment}} expectations {{from the}} Michigan Survey of Consumers to VAR forecastable movements in unemployment. I document three key facts. First, one-half to {{one-third of the}} population <b>expects</b> unemployment <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> when it is falling {{at the end of}} a recession even though the VAR predicts the fall in unemployment. Second, more people <b>expect</b> unemployment <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> when it is falling {{at the end of a}} recession than <b>expect</b> it <b>to</b> <b>rise</b> when it is rising at the beginning of a recession even though the VAR predicts these changes. Finally, the lag change in unemployment is almost as important as the VAR forecast in predicting the fraction of the population that <b>expects</b> unemployment <b>to</b> <b>rise.</b> Professional forecasters do not make these mistakes. Least squares learning or real time expectations do little to help explain these facts. However, delayed updating of expectations can explain some of these facts and extrapolative expectations explains these facts best. Individuals with higher income or education are only slightly less likely to make these expectational errors and those who makes these errors are 8 - 10 percent less likely to believe it is a good time to make a major purchase.
