40|$|The {{question}} of how we can live together with difference is more urgent than ever, now {{that more than half}} of the world’s population live in cities. For example, the majority of London’s inhabitants are ethnic minorities. Following Massey (2005), city dwellers negotiate a situation of intense “throwntogetherness,” as they live in the proximity of ethnic, racial, and religious others. Shifting the dominant focus of media and migration scholarship from transnational communication toward local everyday practices, this article develops the notion of digital throwntogetherness to chart relationships between geographically situated <b>digital</b> <b>identifications</b> and the urban politics of cultural difference and encounter. The argument draws from in-depth interviews with 38 young people living in Haringey, one of the most diverse areas in London, and builds on digital methods for network visualizations.

50|$|A quickly growing {{application}} is in <b>digital</b> <b>identification</b> cards. In this application, the cards {{are used for}} authentication of identity. The most common example is {{in conjunction with a}} PKI. The smart card will store an encrypted digital certificate issued from the PKI along with any other relevant or needed information about the card holder. Examples include the U.S. Department of Defense (DoD) Common Access Card (CAC), and the use of various smart cards by many governments as identification cards for their citizens. When combined with biometrics, smart cards can provide two- or three-factor authentication. Smart cards are not always a privacy-enhancing technology, for the subject carries possibly incriminating information about him all the time. By employing contactless smart cards, that can be read without having to remove the card from the wallet or even the garment it is in, one can add even more authentication value to the human carrier of the cards.|$|E
5000|$|The digital ID project started already {{as early}} as in 1998 when Estonia had sought {{solutions}} on how to digitally identify their citizens. By 1999 a viable project {{in the form of}} current ID-card was proposed and the legal framework to enable <b>digital</b> <b>identification</b> was set up in the following years. In 2000 the Identity Documents Act and the Digital Signatures Act, the two most important bills regulating the use of digital ID’s, were passed in the parliament. The first states the conditions to which an ID-card must adhere to, but most importantly states that the ID-card is compulsory for all Estonian citizens. The latter, states the conditions for a state-governed certification registry, which is fundamentally linked to the functioning of the digital ID-card. Following these events, the first ID-cards where issued in January 2002. Since then about 1.24 million of digital ID-cards have been issued. By the end of 2014 digital ID card has been used about 315 million times for personal identification and 157 million times for digital signatures. An average annual growth rate over 12 years (from 2003 to 2014) amounts to about 7.4 million authentications, and about 3.5 million signatures per year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A <b>digital</b> <b>identification</b> filter {{interacts with}} an output {{reference}} model signal {{known as a}} black-box output system. The identification technique commonly needs the transition and gain matrixes. Both estimation cases are based on mean square criterion obtaining of the minimum output error as the best estimation filtering. The evolution system represents adaptive properties that the identification mechanism includes considering the fuzzy logic strategies affecting in probability sense the evolution identification filter. The fuzzy estimation filter allows in two forms describing the transition and the gain matrixes applying actions that affect the identification structure. Basically, the adaptive criterion conforming the inference mechanisms set, the Knowledge and Rule bases, selecting the optimal coefficients in distribution form. This paper describes the fuzzy strategies applied to the Kalman filter transition function, and gain matrixes. The simulation results were developed using Matlab ©.

40|$|A system being {{developed}} by the Natural History Museum in London {{will make it easier}} for anyone, anywhere in the world, to rapidly find out what kind of insect is attacking a crop. The system, known as DAISY (<b>Digital</b> Automated <b>Identification</b> System) is a computer programme to assist people who may have little knowledge of insects. The only expertise required is the ability to detach a wing from the insect and place it on a slide. The image of the wing is transferred to a computer monitor through a microscope linked to a <b>digital</b> camera. An <b>identification</b> is quickly given together with a page of information about the insect. At present only three groups of insects, 11 species of parasitoid, five species of parasitic wasp and 40 species of biting midge are held in the system's memory. In time, the number of species covered by the system will grow. The researchers responsible for DAISY are confident that it will soon be possible to transfer these images electronically to the Internet. When this happens people in remoter parts of the world will also be able to get rapid identification without needing to send specimens abroad for identification; a process that can sometimes take months.

40|$|Abstract—In this article, {{we propose}} a new method {{for the problem}} of <b>digital</b> camera <b>identification</b> from its images based on the sensor’s pattern noise. For each camera under investigation, we first {{determine}} its reference pattern noise, {{which serves as a}} unique identification fingerprint. This is achieved by averaging the noise obtained from multiple images using a denoising filter. To identify the camera from a given image, we consider the reference pattern noise as a spread spectrum watermark, whose presence in the image is established using a correlation detector. Experiments on approximately 320 images taken with 9 consumer digital cameras are used to estimate false alarm rates and false rejection rates. Additionally, we study how the error rates change with common image processing, such as JPEG compression or gamma correction.

40|$|Sensor pattern noises (SPN), {{extracted}} from digital images as device fingerprints, have been proved {{as an effective}} way for <b>digital</b> device <b>identification.</b> However, the limitation of the current method of extracting the sensor pattern noise is that the SPNs {{extracted from}} images are highly contaminated by the details from the scene {{and as a result}} the misclassification rate is high unless images of large size are used. In this work we propose a novel approach for enhancing sensor pattern noises so as to improve the performance of the identifier. The hypothesis underlying our fingerprint enhancer is that the stronger a signal component is, the less trustworthy the component should be and thus should be attenuated. An enhanced fingerprint can be obtained by assigning weighting factors inversely proportional to the magnitude of the signal components.
