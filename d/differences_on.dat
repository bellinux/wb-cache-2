5|$|Jesus is {{the central}} figure of Christianity. Although Christian views of Jesus vary, it is {{possible}} to summarize the key beliefs shared among major denominations, as stated in their catechetical or confessional texts. Christian views of Jesus are derived from various sources, including the canonical gospels and New Testament letters such as the Pauline epistles and the Johannine writings. These documents outline the key beliefs held by Christians about Jesus, including his divinity, humanity, and earthly life, and that he is the Christ and the Son of God. Despite their many shared beliefs, not all Christian denominations agree on all doctrines, and both major and minor <b>differences</b> <b>on</b> teachings and beliefs have persisted throughout Christianity for centuries.|$|E

Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane mass, scores of educated people were also swayed. Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool.

5|$|The Parthenon frieze is the {{defining}} monument of the High Classical style of Attic sculpture. It stands between the gradual {{eclipse of the}} Severe style, as witnessed on the Parthenon metopes, {{and the evolution of}} the Late Classical Rich style, exemplified by the Nike balustrade. What sources the designer of the frieze drew upon is difficult to gauge, certainly large scale narrative art was familiar to 5th-century Athenians as in the Stoa poikile painting by Polygnotos of Thasos. While there is an overall coherence to the work there are design <b>differences</b> <b>on</b> opposing sides of the frieze that has suggested to some scholars the possibility of more than one designer and a pattern of influence amongst them. There is greater nudity and frontally on the north than the south, the massing and distribution of figures is greatly different on the east than the more widely spaced west, and the east and north generally exhibit greater innovation. This evidence, along with the frequency with which Greek artists are thought to have collaborated, has led Jenifer Neils to hypothesize the existence of two designers working on the sculpture. This would admit the possibility of a later designer comparing and competing with the earlier, and so, explain the observable changes in composition. Geographical orientations also may have dictated what would be represented on one side versus another, i.e., Amazons to the west, and so forth.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the effect of}} PCI on inflammatory factors, cTnI, MMP- 9 and NTpro BNP in patients with unstable angina pectoris. Methods: A total of 80 unstable angina pectoris patients were divided into observation group (40 cases) and control group (40 cases). The observation group was given the therapy of PCI, and the control group was given coronary angiography. To observe the of inflammatory factors, cTnI, MMP- 9 and NT-pro BNP were tested and compared before and after operation.
