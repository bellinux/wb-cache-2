50|$|Surface {{pollination}} is more frequent, {{and appears}} to be a transitional phase between wind pollination and true <b>hydrophily.</b> In these the pollen floats on the surface and reaches the stigmas of the female flowers as in Hydrilla, Callitriche, Ruppia, Zostera, Elodea.

For the other samples with two-step anodization duration of 60 and 80  min, the hydrophilies decreases gradually because of the low adhesive quantity of ZnO. For the sample with one-step anodization duration, the low <b>hydrophily</b> is due to its non-porous structure.|$|E

40|$|According to the {{classical}} textbooks, the gymnosperms are the only seed plants without aquatic species. Recently, however, a set of virtually complete compilations on gymnosperms has been published, enabling a new evaluation of the putative hydrophobia of gymnosperms. This synthesis aims at portraying the relation of all extant gymnosperm species to aquatic and wetland habitats. We present a database of all 986 extant gymnosperm species with their ecological characteristics including 291 cycads, 80 gnetophytes, one ginkgophyte and 614 conifers. We define four categories reflecting the level of hydrophobia and <b>hydrophily</b> of all species and their possible adaptation to wetlands and/or aquatic habitats. Eighty-two percent (805) of the extant species of gymnosperms are clearly hydrophobic, but 18 % (180) are classified as hydrophilic. The podocarp Retrophyllum minus is the only obligate inhabitant of aquatic habitats. This contribution classifies gymnosperms into four categories in reference to their physiological and morphological adaptation to a moisture gradient. It relativizes the putative hydrophobia of gymnosperms and provides new perspectives for research on gymnosperms...|$|E
30|$|Up to date, great {{efforts have}} been devoted to the {{synthesis}} of high-quality UCNPs typically through hydrothermal reaction and thermal decomposition of RE organic precursors, two most commonly used synthetic methods. However, they still have their respective defects albeit successful in some respects. For instance, typical synthetic methods generally need complicated post surface modification to couple with functional groups for <b>hydrophily</b> and biocompatibility [16], which is a two-step synthesis. Recently, our group has introduced a novel oleic acid-ionic liquids (OA-ILs) dual phase synthesis method, by which hydrophilic and hydrophobic Ln-doped upconversion crystals could be selectively synthetized in a one-pot approach [17 – 19]. In fact, the hydrophilic products obtained by dual-phase method are poorly dispersed and easy to get aggregated in solution because of the complicated surface groups coming from ILs. In a word, one-step synthesis method can simplify the reaction procedure, while products by the two-step synthesis can have better uniformity and monodispersity. As we know that some hydrophilic agents can participate in ligand exchange reaction to endow nanomaterial with hydrophilia and good monodispersity, including sodium citrate [20], polyethylene glycol (PEG) [21], EDTA [22, 23], 6 -aminohexanoic acid (AA) [24], etc.|$|E
30|$|In the {{presence}} of DESs with urea and polyols as HBD except ChCl/ 1, 4 -butanediol, optical purity of (R)-PED had slight difference from that in the DES-free system, and slight higher enantiopurities of (R)-PED were obtained when using ChCl/urea or ChCl/TEG as the co-solvent. Similarly, the addition of DESs using urea and polyols as hydrogen bond donor to phosphate buffer lead to slight changes in pH value (pH 6.48 – 6.65 vs pH 6.42). In addition, the comparatively slight changes (0.48 – 0.92  mM/h vs 0.56  mM/h) in non-enzymatic hydrolysis of epoxide were displayed in DES-containing solutions with urea or polyols as HBD. The results above, for the tested DESs, indicate that non-enzymatic hydrolysis of the epoxide in DES-containing buffer depends on not only the pH of reaction system but also the co-solvent of DES. For instance, the improvement in the solubility of SO was observed after adding small amount of co-solvent so as to inhibit the natural hydrolysis of the substrate (Chen et al. 2011). Besides, the <b>hydrophily</b> of DESs allows them to structurally tie up water molecules to change catalytically active confirmation of enzyme (Zhao et al. 2011).|$|E
30|$|The net {{charge of}} derived {{peptides}} with one site mutants (H 1, H 2, H 3 and H 4) increased from + 3 to + 4, {{and the two}} sites mutants was + 5 (H 5, H 6, H 7 and H 8). Due to the higher <b>hydrophily</b> of arginine and lysine, the grand average of hydropathicity (GRAVY) slightly decreased for one site mutants (from − 0.672 to − 0.690 for H 1 and H 3, and to − 0.705 for H 2 and H 4, respectively), and it further decreased for two sites mutants (− 0.708 for H 5, − 0.722 for H 6 and H 7, and − 0.738 for H 8, respectively). The related high hydrophilicity {{may contribute to the}} surface contact of pathogens and peptides. The Boman index indicates the binding activity of drugs to protein, the large value may induce high negative side effects. Generally, it was considered that the value was acceptable as 1 – 3 kcal/mol (Weistroffer 2007). The Boman index of derived peptides was all between 1.54 and 2.03  kcal/mol, indicating they may have little negative side effects as novel antimicrobial agents (Table  1).|$|E
30|$|The {{dispersibility}} of ZnO NPs in aqua can {{be improved}} by surface modification, but the highly expensive surfactant increases the manufacture cost, including polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP), oleic acid (OA), together with diethanolamine (DEA), polyethylene glycol methyl ether (PGME), poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA), and polystyrene (PS). Also, graphite sheet and carbon nanotubes possessed larger specific surface area, which can indeed facilitate the dispersion of nanoparticles, but their easy carbonization at high-temperature, high-cost, and complicated preparation process will limit their large-scale applications, whereas halloysite nanotubes (HNTs) as the support could {{make up for the}} above disadvantages to some extent. Natural clay minerals, such as kaolinite [9, 10], halloysite [11], montmorillonite [2, 12 – 16], and palygorskite [17 – 20] are widely used in the catalysis, energy storage, and wastewater treatment application by loading the traditional nanomaterials, which means that they can be used as cost-efficient matrix to improve the dispersion of ZnO given to their natural nanostructures, unique ion exchange capacities, superior <b>hydrophily,</b> and excellent mechanical properties. Such features may not only bring ZnO NPs to be closer to the membrane of bacteria to hamper the normal function of bacteria [21] but also increase the local zinc concentration to inhibit the growth of bacteria [22]. A series of novel metal nanoparticles such as gold [3], silver [23], and copper [24] have strong bactericidal activities for bacteria, fungi, and virus. Using a combination of noble metal and metal oxide antibacterial agent, bacterial growth and survival is believed to be effectively inhibited.|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between biological diversity and ecosystem functioning {{is a central}} theme in ecology. Ecological traits of species are often regarded as a link between structure and function, and trait distributions in a community may change in response to environmental stressors. Likewise, resilience in a community may be derived from the diversity in traits and trait values relevant to a particular stressor. We combine two approaches to test this: a novel trait frequency analysis and a multivariate ordination approach. The two methods are applied on {{a case study of}} an earthworm community in a frequently flooded floodplain in the Netherlands. Periodic flooding in floodplains restricts population growth and recolonization of earthworms. The strategies employed by different earthworm species for coping with this stress can be described by a combination of ecological traits. From the literature we compiled 10 ecological traits for the earthworm species encountered along an inundation gradient in the Duursche Waarden floodplain area flanking the river IJssel. Trait frequency analysis showed a greater diversity at low elevation sites of traits considered to be associated to flood tolerance, suggesting greater community resilience to flooding. The ordination analysis using trait composition provided information on which trait classes in the community were related with the inundation stress. Results from both analyses showed that important traits in species to deal with flooding are active dispersal, high <b>hydrophily,</b> diapause and parthenogenetic reproduction. Thus, a further understanding of community resilience was gained by combining traditional ordination analysis with trait diversity analysi...|$|E
40|$|The poorly known {{millipede}} Aporodesminus wallacei Silvestri 1904 {{appears to}} be a widespread pantropical species currently reported from St. Helena Island (southern Atlantic Ocean), the Hawaiian Islands, Tahiti (central Polynesia), and the vicinity of Sydney, Australia (Pacific Ocean). Of these records (the latter two are new), the Sydney adults and subadults have been taken underwater in a few creeks of a single small catchment area. This is only the third polydesmoid, and second Pyrgodesmidae, definitely attributable to semiaquatic millipedes. This habit is further proved by indirect evidence coming from the structure of the mouthparts and a cerotegument enabling plastron respiration. As virtually no record can readily be associated with man/human settlements, the hypothesis is put forth that, as is the case for numerous (sub) cosmopolitan water-dwellers, dispersal of this minute species (4. 5 - 6. 6 mm) could have been due to zoochory at least not less likely than to hydrochory or anthropochorism, whereas the remote and scattered islands can hardly be taken as the original source area for A. wallacei. Based solely on similar cerotegment structures as well as on a strikingly similar distribution pattern, but without direct evidence of <b>hydrophily,</b> the same habits if not dispersal mechanism can be suggested for one more pantropical pyrgodesmid, Cryptocorypha ornata (Attems 1938), which has been reported from St. Helena Island, the Hawaiis, the Cook Islands, the Marquesa Islands, Tahiti and Hong Kong. The four latter localities are likewise new...|$|E
30|$|In addition, for the ZnO film {{prepared}} on the PAA {{surface with}} two-step anodization duration for 80  min, the adherence of the biofilm {{and the total}} amount of biofilm bacteria are both the highest among the four samples. However, for the ZnO film prepared on the PAA surface with two-step anodization duration for 40  min, the antibiofilm property is optimal. This could be because of the biofilm adherence that is inhibited by the highest hydrophobicity, and then less exopolysaccharides (EPS) and the other nutrient against the growth of biofilm bacterial. For the ZnO film prepared on the PAA surface with two-step anodization duration for 80  min, its <b>hydrophily</b> is good for the initial adherence of the biofilm, and less ZnO particles do not inhibit the growth of the biofilm bacteria. Meanwhile, more biofilm adhesive materials nourish the biofilm bacteria, and the biofilm bacteria multiply rapidly. Consistent with our research, the biofilm adherence is inhibited by the higher hydrophobicity of ZnO film in the initial stage of the biofilm formation [49]. The adherence of biofilms is affected by the hydrophobic and hydrophilic properties of the materials [14, 53, 54]. Bonsaglia et al. [14] reported that L. monocytogenes adhere to the hydrophilic surface more easily than to the hydrophobic surface. Many studies found that the bacterial adhesion is reduced or inhibited by hydrophobic surface [47, 54]. Shaer et al. [54] indicated that the biofilm colonization on the functionalizing orthopedic hardware could be prevented by hydrophobic polycations. Chen et al. [55] also suggested that the biofilm could be inhibited by low surface free energy. The results matched those from us.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Corn cob residue (CCR) {{is a kind}} {{of waste}} {{lignocellulosic}} material with enormous potential for bioethanol production. The moderated sulphite processes were used to enhance the <b>hydrophily</b> of the material by sulfonation and hydrolysis. The composition, FT-IR spectra, and conductometric titrations of the pretreated materials were measured to characterize variations of the CCR in different sulfite pretreated environments. And the objective {{of this study is to}} compare the saccharification rate and yield of the samples caused by these variations. Results It was found that the lignin in the CCR (43. 2 %) had reduced to 37. 8 %, 38. 0 %, 35. 9 %, and 35. 5 % after the sulfite pretreatment in neutral, acidic, alkaline, and ethanol environments, respectively. The sulfite pretreatments enhanced the glucose yield of the CCR. Moreover, the ethanol sulfite sample had the highest glucose yield (81. 2 %, based on the cellulose in the treated sample) among the saccharification samples, which was over 10 % higher than that of the raw material (70. 6 %). More sulfonic groups and weak acid groups were produced during the sulfite pretreatments. Meanwhile, the ethanol sulfite treated sample had the highest sulfonic group (0. 103 mmol/g) and weak acid groups (1. 85 mmol/g) in all sulfite treated samples. In FT-IR spectra, the variation of bands at 1168 and 1190 cm - 1 confirmed lignin sulfonation during sulfite pretreatment. The disappearance of the band at 1458 cm - 1 implied the methoxyl on lignin had been removed during the sulfite pretreatments. Conclusions It can be concluded that the lignin in the CCR can be degraded and sulfonated during the sulfite pretreatments. The pretreatments improve the hydrophility of the samples because of the increase in sulfonic group and weak acid groups, which enhances the glucose yield of the material. The ethanol sulfite pretreatment is the best method for lignin removal and with the highest glucose yield. </p...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAfter an {{introduction}} reporting the properties and the applications of fluoropolymers, a first part deals with i) the main routes to produce chlorotrifluoroethylene (CTFE) monomer, ii) its telomerization reaction involving various chain transfer agents, iii) its homopolymerization, and iv) {{the advantages and}} uses of (PCTFE). In a second section, this review, illustrated by numerous examples, extensively reports the synthesis, properties and applications of the copolymers based on CTFE with non-halogenated, fluorinated, commercially available or synthesized comonomers. These comonomers exhibit XYC=CZ-Sp-R structures where X, Y, and Z represent H, F, and CF 3 groups, Sp a spacer and R an alkyl group, a halogen atom or a function such as OH, OAc, SAc, CO 2 R' (R' being a H atom or an alkyl group), and SO 3 H. According to the nature and {{to the amount of}} the comonomer, the copolymers can be thermoplastic, elastomeric or thermoplastic elastomers. Introducing reactive R side groups brings complementary properties such as solubility, <b>hydrophily,</b> ionic exchange or surface properties, or further crosslinking of the resulting copolymers. Then, the kinetics of radical copolymerization of CTFE with M comonomers led to the assessment of the reactivity ratios which are compared. Hence, a reactivity series of these M comonomers with respect to a macroradical terminated by CTFE is proposed. Usually, these copolymers exhibit random structures except with vinyl ethers that produced alternating copolymers with CTFE. The controlled radical copolymerizations of CTFE with other comonomers (such as vinylidene fluoride or vinyl ether) either in the presence of borinates or iodo-compounds are also reported. In addition, new CTFE-containing copolymers exhibit well-defined architectures, such as telechelic, alternating, block and graft copolymers. They can be synthesized either by conventional techniques (i. e. telomerisation) or by controlled radical copolymerization. Chemical modifications of PCTFE and poly(CTFE-co-monomer) copolymers are also presented. Several properties and applications (such as surfactants, optical fibres, polymer electrolytes for lithium ion batteries, dielectrical polymers, thermoplastic elastomers, fuel cell and ultrafiltration membranes) of these CTFE containing copolymers also illustrate this review...|$|E
