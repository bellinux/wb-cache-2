40|$|The present {{invention}} relates {{generally to}} the removal of solid particulate material from high-temperature gas streams, and more particularly the removal of such particulate material by employing a barrier filter formed of a carbon-carbon composite provided by a porous carbon fiber substrate with open <b>interstitial</b> <b>regions</b> between adjacently disposed carbon fibers selectively restricted by carbon integrally attached to the carbon fibers of the substrate. In a typical utilization of a particulate-bearing hot gas stream, the particulate loading of the gas stream after cleaning is normally less than about 50 ppm and with essentially no particulates larger than about 10 microns. This carbon-carbon filter for removing particulate material of a particle size larger than a preselected particle size from a gas stream at a temperature greater than about 800 F, is produced by the steps which comprise: providing a substrate of carbonaceous fibers with pore-forming open <b>interstitial</b> <b>regions</b> between adjacently disposed fibers; and, sufficiently filling these open <b>interstitial</b> <b>regions</b> with carbon integrally attached to {{and supported by the}} fibers for providing the <b>interstitial</b> <b>regions</b> with throughgoing passage-ways of a pore size sufficient to provide for the passage of the gas stream while preventing the passage of particulate material larger than a preselected particle size...|$|R

50|$|The muffin-tin {{approximation}} is a shape {{approximation of}} the potential field in an atomistic environment. It is most commonly employed in quantum mechanical simulations of electronic band structure in solids. The approximation was proposed by John C. Slater. Augmented plane wave method is a method which uses muffin-tin approximation. It is a method to approximate the energy states of an electron in a crystal lattice. The basic approximation lies in the potential in which the potential {{is assumed to be}} spherically symmetric in the muffin-tin region and constant in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region.</b> Wave functions (the augmented plane waves) are constructed by matching solutions of the Schrödinger equation within each sphere with plane-wave solutions in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region,</b> and linear combinations of these wave functions are then determined by the variational method Many modern electronic structure methods employ the approximation. Among them are the augmented plane wave (APW) method, the linear muffin-tin orbital method (LMTO) and various Green's function methods. One application is found in the variational theory developed by Korringa (1947) and by Kohn and Rostoker (1954) referred to as the KKR method. This method has been adapted to treat random materials as well, where it is called the KKR coherent potential approximation.|$|E

Because of the vascularity of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> particularly during pregnancy, blood loss during surgery may be substantial. Postoperatively, patients with conservative surgical therapy {{are at risk for}} development of a persistent ectopic pregnancy due to the presence of deeply embedded surviving trophoblastic tissue; thus, monitoring of hCG levels is indicated until they become undetectable.|$|E
50|$|In the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> of {{constant}} potential, the single electron wave functions can be expanded {{in terms of}} plane waves. In the atom-centered regions, the wave functions can be expanded in terms of spherical harmonics and the eigenfunctions of a radial Schrödinger equation. Such use of functions other than plane waves as basis functions is termed the augmented plane-wave approach (of which there are many variations). It allows for an efficient representation of single-particle wave functions {{in the vicinity of}} the atomic cores where they can vary rapidly (and where plane waves would be a poor choice on convergence grounds in the absence of a pseudopotential).|$|E

5000|$|Segmental duplications {{found in}} primate genomes fall {{under one of}} three classifications. These are the pericentromeric, subtelomeric, and {{interstitial}} regions. Segmental duplications in pericentromeric regions are unique in that around 30% of their sequence {{can be traced to}} duplications occurring from other chromosomes. In addition, pericentromeric regions can either have no segmental duplication or an extreme amount. Specifically, twenty-nine of the forty-three pericentromeric regions have some form of segmental duplication totaling 47.6Mb, which is almost a third of all segmental duplications found in the human genome. Segmental duplication in subtelomeric regions are similar to those pericentromeric in that they are enriched in interchromosomal segmental duplications. Furthermore, thirty of the forty-two subtelomeric regions contain segmental duplications. However, these segmental duplications total only 2.6Mb. It is not known whether the duplications of the subtelomeric regions arise from other chromosomes like it is for the pericentromeric regions. On the other hand, <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> segmental duplications are distributed on the euchromatin between the pericentromeric and subtelomeric regions. In addition, they account for the most of the interchromosomal duplications.

40|$|The {{management}} of sodic soils often involves {{the addition of}} Ca 2 + cations because {{it is believed that}} these divalent cations will easily desorb the Na+ cations from the soil solid phase. However, the adsorption of cations in the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> of minerals is counterintuitive, particularly if the diameter of the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> is less than 1 nanometer. These very small dimensions are common in many soil minerals. Using zeolites, the ideal cation for treating sodic soils may be another monovalent cation, such as K+, rather than Ca 2 +.

The most striking feature was an extensive network of basement membranes localized mainly around Schwann cells and small blood vessels.

Some laminin and nidogen could be extracted with 0. 5 M NaCl and were shown by electrophoresis to have the characteristic chain and fragment patterns described previously for these proteins isolated from the mouse Engelbreth-Holm-Swarm (EHS) sarcoma. Fragments of collagen IV and collagen VI were solubilized by limited proteolytic digestion and identified after rotary shadowing. The more remote <b>interstitial</b> <b>regions</b> of the tumor contained cross-striated collagen fibrils which were composed of collagen III (diameter, 20 – 30 nm) or collagen I (diameter, 40 – 50 nm).

40|$|SummaryBackgroundNonspecific {{interstitial}} pneumonia (NSIP) {{is characterized}} by the interstitial infiltration T lymphocytes (TLs). Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) has been used to analyze the inflammatory cells infiltrating in lung. The controversy about whether the BALF cellular profile reflects T lymphocytes in lung tissue still persists. Some studies found a positive correlation of cell composition between BALF and lung tissue, but others gave opposite conclusion. ObjectiveTo investigate CD 4 + and CD 8 + T lymphocytes distribution in lung tissue of NSIP and the relationship with T lymphocytes in bronchoalveolar lavage. MethodsThirty-seven patients diagnosed as NSIP were included. The pathological and BALF date were reviewed. The characteristics of TLs infiltration in different lung regions were investigated. ResultsThe study included 28 women. The median age was 48 years. In lung tissue, CD 4 + and CD 8 + lymphocytes (counts/ 0. 1 mm 2) were separately accounted in lymphoid follicle region (156. 51  ±  90. 70 vs 85. 30  ±  43. 75), small blood vessel region (66. 58  ±  31. 99 vs 58. 43  ±  30. 24), <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> (37. 60  ±  19. 40 vs 47. 12  ±  33. 42) and small airway region (26. 59  ±  17. 04 vs 40. 18  ±  34. 02). CD 4 +/CD 8 + ratios in lymphoid follicle and small vessel > 1, in interstitium and small airway < 1. The number of CD 8 + lymphocytes in BALF was correlated with CD 8 + lymphocytes around small airway (r =  0. 360, p =  0. 029) and in <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> (r =  0. 451, p =  0. 005).

The principal motivation of this computational method is to obtain detailed information about the structural and electronic properties including discharge voltage and electronic conductivities of the positive electrodes Li 2 TiS 3, Li 3 NbS 4 and also for their corresponding delithiated phases LiTiS 3 and Li 2 NbS 4.To perform these calculations, the exchange–correlation potential according to the Perdew–Burke–Ernzerhof parameterization is used [30]. In this method, the space is divided into an <b>interstitial</b> <b>region</b> and non-overlapping muffin-tin (MT) spheres centered at the atomic sites. In the <b>interstitial</b> <b>region,</b> the basis set consists of plane waves. Inside the MT spheres, the basis set is described by radial solutions of the one particle Schrödinger equation (at fixed energy) and their energy derivatives multiplied by spherical harmonics. To determine the equilibrium volume (V 0) and the structural parameters for all the compounds the total energies are computed. For these calculations, self-consistency is obtained {{with the use of}} 5000  k points in the entire Brillouin zone [28]. The electronic properties are calculated within GGA approximation. The variations in electronic conductivity due to extraction of lithium are determined with the BoltzTrap code interfaced with WIEN 2 K [31].|$|E
