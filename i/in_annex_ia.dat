30|$|The {{authorization}} of biocides and biocidal products is regulated in the EU {{according to the}} rules and procedures laid down in the Biocide Products Directive (BPD, 98 / 8 /EC)[2]. A key precondition for the {{authorization of}} a biocidal product is the inclusion of its active substances in the “list of permitted active substances”, provided as <b>Annex</b> I or <b>IA</b> of the BPD (“positive list”). Only products that contain active substances that are listed <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> I/IA are allowed on the EU-market, and the risk from their intended use to man and the environment is then assessed at the national level, complemented by the mutual recognition of authorizations between the EU member states.|$|R
40|$|Following {{the entry}} into force of the Directive 98 / 8 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council {{concerning}} the placing of biocidal products on the market, all active substances in the European market have to be reviewed to ensure that under normal conditions of use {{they can be used}} without unacceptable risk for people, animals or the environment. Thus, in the frame of the review process, the risk assessment of each active substance plays a fundamental role and providing technical guidance to the assessments that must be performed ensures a correct and uniform implementation of the Directive for the different Member States. According to Annex VI of Directive 98 / 8 /EC the risk assessment shall cover the proposed normal use of the biocidal product together with a ‘realistic worst case scenario’. The aim of this Emission Scenario Document (ESD) is to set up methods for the estimation of the emission of disinfectants, used for the disinfection of vehicles used for animal transport, for veterinary hygiene and in hatcheries. 	 The present ESD is intended to be used by Member States as a basis for assessing applications submitted with a view to include existing active substances used in PT 3 <b>in</b> <b>Annex</b> I or <b>IA</b> of Directive 98 / 8 /EC or for assessing applications for product authorisation. It can be a useful tool also for Industry, when assessing requirements for a submission. These Technical Notes for Guidance have been developed in the context of project FKZ 360 04 023 of the German Federal Environmental Agency (UBA), who contracted SCC GmbH for a first draft of the document. The first draft was then revised by the Biocides Sector of the JRC, taking into account the comments of the Member States. The final version, approved by the Technical Meeting, was endorsed by the Competent Authority Meeting in May 2011. JRC. I. 1 -Chemical Assessment and Testin...|$|R
