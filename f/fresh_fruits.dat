5|$|The {{value of}} eating a certain food to {{maintain}} health was recognized long before vitamins were identified. The ancient Egyptians knew that feeding liver {{to a person}} may help with night blindness, an illness now known {{to be caused by}} a vitamin A deficiency. The advancement of ocean voyages during the Renaissance resulted in prolonged periods without access to <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables, and made illnesses from vitamin deficiency common among ships' crews.|$|E

The transfer of potassium ions through nerve cell membranes is necessary for normal nerve transmission; potassium deficiency and excess can each result in numerous abnormalities, including an abnormal heart rhythm and various electrocardiographic (ECG) abnormalities. <b>Fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables are good dietary sources of potassium. The body responds to the influx of dietary potassium, which raises serum potassium levels, with a shift of potassium from outside to inside cells {{and an increase in}} potassium excretion by the kidneys.|$|E

5|$|Applewood Farm {{has served}} as a farm for over a century, with an 1850 census {{reporting}} it produced butter, cheese, rye, Indian corn, oats, wool, Irish potatoes and hay. Three apple orchards planted by Russell Gallup would become an important part of Applewood Farms and owe its name to those orchards. After Everett Gallup took over the farm in the 1920s, the farm produced <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables and poultry, eggs and dairy products. In 1994, the Applewood Farm reported having 700 trees tapped for maple syrup production and showed visitors the process of producing the syrup. Applewood Farms was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 under criteria A for the Gallup family history that {{played an important role in}} the local history and under criteria C as an architecturally important example of a late colonial center chimney house.|$|E
5|$|The {{theory that}} Henry {{suffered}} from syphilis has been dismissed by most historians. Historian Susan Maclean Kybett ascribes his demise to scurvy, {{which is caused}} by a lack of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables. Alternatively, his wives' pattern of pregnancies and his mental deterioration have led some to suggest that the king may have been Kell positive and suffered from McLeod syndrome. According to another study, Henry VIII's history and body morphology may have been the result of traumatic brain injury after his 1536 jousting accident, which in turn led to a neuroendocrine cause of his obesity. This analysis identifies growth hormone deficiency (GHD) as the source for his increased adiposity but also significant behavioural changes noted in his later years, including his multiple marriages.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants {{are used}} as food {{additives}} to help guard against food deterioration. Exposure to oxygen and sunlight are the two main factors in the oxidation of food, so food is preserved by keeping {{in the dark and}} sealing it in containers or even coating it in wax, as with cucumbers. However, as oxygen is also important for plant respiration, storing plant materials in anaerobic conditions produces unpleasant flavors and unappealing colors. Consequently, packaging of <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables contains an ~8% oxygen atmosphere. Antioxidants are an especially important class of preservatives as, unlike bacterial or fungal spoilage, oxidation reactions still occur relatively rapidly in frozen or refrigerated food. These preservatives include natural antioxidants such as ascorbic acid (AA, E300) and tocopherols (E306), as well as synthetic antioxidants such as propyl gallate (PG, E310), tertiary butylhydroquinone (TBHQ), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA, E320) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT, E321).|$|E

(species of tomato) were {{crossbred}} {{to raise}} F 1 {{so as to}} assess the effect of crossbreeding {{as a tool for}} tomato improvement as shown in yield. This was done by emasculating S. esculentum using it as female parent and transferring ripe pollen grains from S. pimpinellifolium the male parent using artificial means. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was employed in data analysis. Result showed that the parental plants and F 1 hybrid differed significantly in <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> weight, number of seeds per fruit, fruit colour, <b>fruit</b> width and <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> length. F 1 hybrid had the highest number of seeds per fruit when compared to the parental plants. S. esculentum recorded the highest <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> weight, <b>fruit</b> width and <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> length when compared to S. pimpinellifolium and F 1 hybrid, though the F 1 hybrid was statistically at par with S. esculentum in <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> length. S. pimpinellifolium had the least <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> weight, fruit width, number of seeds per <b>fruit</b> and <b>fresh</b> <b>fruit</b> length (1. 80 ± 0. 01, 8. 03 ± 1. 0, 110. 56 ± 0. 01 and 4. 00 ± 0. 03, respectively). S. pimpinellifolium had a very dark red coloured fruits, followed by the F 1 hybrid with dark red coloured fruits. S. esculentum had a light red coloured fruits based on the colour guide and the scale point used. The obtained data indicated that when two tomato plants of different but closely related varieties are crossbred, a new variety that combines the characters of the parental plants and enhanced genetic attributes is produced. F 1 hybrid had the highest number of seeds per fruit and though had fruits smaller in size than S. esculentum but performed better than S. pimpinellifolium indicating that crossbreeding could be a tool for tomato improvement...|$|R
5|$|Like humans, {{but unlike}} most other mammals, guinea pigs cannot {{synthesize}} their own vitamin C and must obtain this vital nutrient from food. If guinea pigs do not ingest enough vitamin C, they can suffer from potentially fatal scurvy. Guinea pigs require about 10mg of vitamin C daily (20mg if pregnant), {{which can be}} obtained through fresh, raw fruits and vegetables (such as broccoli, apple, cabbage, carrot, celery, and spinach) or through dietary supplements. Healthy diets for guinea pigs require a complex balance of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium, and hydrogen ions; adequate amounts of vitamins E, A, and D are also necessary. Imbalanced diets {{have been associated with}} muscular dystrophy, metastatic calcification, difficulties with pregnancy, vitamin deficiencies, and teeth problems. Guinea pigs tend to be fickle eaters when it comes to <b>fresh</b> <b>fruits</b> and vegetables, having learned early in life what is and is not appropriate to consume, and their habits are difficult to change after maturity. They do not respond well to sudden changes in diet; they may stop eating and starve rather than accept new food types. A constant supply of hay or other food is generally recommended, as guinea pigs feed continuously and may develop habits such as chewing on their own hair if food is not present. Because guinea pigs' teeth grow constantly, they routinely , lest their teeth become too large for their mouths, a common problem in rodents. Guinea pigs also chew on cloth, paper, plastic, and rubber.|$|E
