Shocks due to defective wiring in home appliances or other electrical equipment can cause severe burns, even death. As a result, the National Electrical Code now requires GFIs in all new homes constructed. This particular type of GFI employs a sensing element which derives from technology acquired in space projects by SCI Systems, Inc., Huntsville, Alabama, producer of sensors for GE and other manufacturers of GFI equipment. The sensor is based on the company's experience in developing miniaturized circuitry for space telemetry and other spacecraft electrical systems; this experience enabled SCI to package interruptor circuitry in the extremely limited space available and to produce sensory devices at practicable cost. The tiny sensor measures the strength of the electrical current and detects current differentials that indicate a fault in the functioning of an electrical system. The sensing element then triggers a signal to a disconnect mechanism in the GFI, which cuts off the current in the faulty circuit...|$|E

The test facility was set up to test magnetic bearings under high-temperature (1100 F) and high-speed (20, 000 rpm) conditions. The magnetic bearing is located at the center of gravity of the rotor between two high-temperature grease-packed mechanical ball bearings. The drive-end duplex angular contact ball bearing, which is in full contact, acts as a moment release and provides axial stability. The outboard end ball bearing has a 0. 015 -in. radial clearance between the rotor to act as a backup bearing and to compensate for axial thermal expansion. There is a 0. 020 -in. radial air gap between the stator pole and the rotor. The stator was wrapped with three 1 -kW band heaters to create a localized hot section; the mechanical ball bearings were outside this section. Eight threaded rods supported the stator. These incorporated a plunger and Bellville washers to compensate for radial thermal expansion and provide rotor-to-stator alignment.

Detecting a high-resistance <b>grounding</b> <b>fault</b> proves a tough and challenging task for DC system safety. Traditionally, the methods of AC injection and DC leakage are widely used [84]. The method of AC injection monitors the <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> through injecting a low frequency sine wave signal into the DC system, while the method of DC leakage directly inspects the <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> with a DC leakage current. Reference [84] proposed a novel method of injecting different frequency signals. This method maintains both the advantages of high precision of the traditional AC injection method {{and it can be}} protected from the influence of the distributed capacitor in the DC system. A <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> monitoring technique for an extra-low voltage direct current (ELVDC, up to a 60 V DC) distribution system was presented in [85]. A built environment equipotential property was applied in this technique. It is a good solution for <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> detection when the DC leakage current is at a low level and not detectable. Reference [44] designed a probe unit to detect and locate the <b>ground</b> <b>fault</b> for unground a DC traction system.
