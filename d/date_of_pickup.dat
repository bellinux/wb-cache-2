Mentored by Eli Abumeri, I was trained {{in areas of}} Information Technology such as: Servers, printers, scanners, CAD systems, Web, Programming, and Database Management, ODIN (networking, computers, and phones). I {{worked closely with the}} Chemical Sampling and Analysis Team (CSAT) to redesign a database to more efficiently manage and maintain data collected for the Drinking Water Program. This Program has been established for over fifteen years here at the Glenn Research Center. It involves the continued testing and retesting of all drinking water dispensers. The quality of the drinking water is of great importance and is determined by comparing the concentration of contaminants in the water with specifications set forth by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) and its 1986 and 1991 amendments. The Drinking Water Program consists of periodic testing of all drinking water fountains and sinks. Each is tested at least once every 2 years for contaminants and naturally occurring species. The EPA's protocol is to collect an initial and a 5 minute draw from each dispenser. The 5 minute draw is what is used for the maximum contaminant level. However, the CS&AT has added a 30 second draw since most individuals do not run the water 5 minutes prior to drinking. This data is then entered into a relational Microsoft Access database. The database allows for the quick retrieval of any test@) done on any dispenser. The data can be queried by building number, date or test type, and test results are documented in an analytical report for employees to read. To aid with the tracking of recycled materials within the lab, my help was enlisted to create a database that could make this process less cumbersome and more efficient. The <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>pickup,</b> type of material, weight received, and unit cost per recyclable. This information could then calculate the dollar amount generated by the recycling of certain materials. This database will ultimately prove useful in determining the amounts of materials consumed by the lab and will help serve as an indicator potential overuse...|$|E

40|$|Many {{companies}} have a central depot to store {{raw materials and}} finished products. There are many factories located around the central depot. Each factory has a demand <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> for the finished products and a demand of delivery for raw materials. During each day within the planning period, a fleet of capacitated vehicles traveling along routes which begin and end at the central depot are needed to transport the raw materials and the finished products between them. A special constraint of this {{problem is that the}} pickup demand has to be satisfied exactly on the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> appointment, but delivery demand can be satisfied on or before the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> appointment.

40|$|A {{steady state}} model <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> ion {{energization}} upstream of a cometary bow wave {{is presented in}} order to investigate the effects of quasi-linear energy diffusion in the turbulence there. The model assumes that the ions are immediately isotropized at pickup, and it includes the effects of adiabatic acceleration in the slowing solar wind and <b>of</b> continual <b>pickup</b> <b>of</b> ions as the comet is approached. By taking all physical quantities to fall off as power laws with distance from the comet, an analytical expression is obtained for the distribution function <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> ions in the reference frame moving with the solar wind. To illustrate the application of this model, the model results are compared to the observations <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> ions at comet Giacobini-Zinner.

The model does not compare well with these observations, {{but it is not clear}} whether the differences are due to artificial problems in the model or the data analysis or to the action of other energization processes at this comet. Preliminary results from the Halley encounters appear to agree more closely with this model...|$|R

Like all side-by-side humbuckers, they have lower hum levels. This configuration operates {{in the same way as}} a humbucker: both coils individually respond to string vibrations, but since the two coils have a reversed magnetic polarity, the signal from both coils is added, while the hum is effectively canceled. Consequently, these types <b>of</b> <b>pickups</b> sound more like a humbucker than a P-90.|$|R

40|$|Description of the {{physical}} behavior of electric guitars is still not very widespread in the scientific literature. In particular, {{the physical}} models describing a nonlinear behavior <b>of</b> <b>pickups</b> still requires some refinements. The study {{presented in this paper}} is focused on nonlinear modeling <b>of</b> the <b>pickups.</b> Two main issues are raised. First, is the currently most used nonlinear model (a Hammerstein model) sufficient for the complex nonlinear behavior <b>of</b> the <b>pickup?</b> In other words, would a more complex model, such as a Generalized Hammerstein that can deal better with the nonlinear memory, yield better results? The second troublesome issue is how to measure the nonlinear behavior <b>of</b> a <b>pickup</b> correctly. A specific experimental set-up allowing for driving the pickup in a controlled way (string displacement perpendicular to the pickup) and to separate the nonlinear model <b>of</b> the <b>pickup</b> from other nonlinearities in the measurement chain is proposed. Thanks to this experimental set-up, a Generalized Hammerstein model <b>of</b> the <b>pickup</b> is estimated for frequency range 15 – 500 Hz and the results are compared with a simple Hammerstein model. A comparison with experimental results shows that both models succeed in describing the pickup when used in realistic conditions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—As we {{progress}} {{towards a}} world where robots play an integral role in society, a critical problem {{that remains to be}} solved is the Pickup Team Challenge; that is, dynamically formed heterogeneous robot teams executing coordinated tasks where little information is known a priori about the tasks, the robots, and the environments in which they will operate. Successful solutions to forming pickup teams will enable researchers to experiment with larger numbers of robots and enable industry to efficiently and cost-effectively integrate new robot technology with existing legacy teams. In this paper, we define the challenge <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> teams and propose the treasure hunt domain for evaluating the performance <b>of</b> <b>pickup</b> teams.
