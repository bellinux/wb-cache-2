40|$|The {{push toward}} the {{miniaturization}} of electromechanical devices {{and the resulting}} need for micro-power generation systems with low-weight, long-life devices {{has led to the}} recent development of the field of micro-combustion. The concept behind this new field is that since batteries have low specific energy and liquid hydrocarbon fuels have a very high specific energy, a miniaturized power-generating device, even with a relatively inefficient conversion of hydrocarbon fuels to power, would result in increased lifetime and/or reduced weight of an electronic or mechanical system that currently requires batteries for power. The high energy density of hydrocarbon fuels creates a great opportunity to develop combustion based micro-power generation systems to meet increasing demands for portable power devices, micro unmanned aerial vehicles, micro-satellite thrusters, and micro chemical reactors and sensors. In this paper, the recent technological development and progress in fundamental understanding of micro-scale combustion are reviewed. Furthermore, gas-phase combustion in small channels is reviewed. Flame stabilization is contrasted to propagation and the mechanisms for stability loss are discussed. The role of <b>key</b> <b>wall</b> materials’ parameters and operation variables in flame characteristics and stability is elucidated...|$|E
40|$|Film cooling is a {{technique}} used in gas turbine engines, and blades and rocket nozzles to protect critical surfaces from the hot combustion gases. In film cooling applications, a relatively cool thin fluid is injected along surfaces and subsequently mix with the hot mainstream, thus leading to a reduction of protection at the wall. The breakdown of this film involves complex physics including intense turbulent mixing, heat transfer, conduction, radiation and variable density effects to name a few. In this dissertation, film cooling is both experimentally measured and numerically simulated. The experiments feature non-intrusive Particle Image Velocimetry to provide two-dimensional planes of mean and fluctuating velocity, which are critical in order to characterize and understand the turbulent flow phenomena involved in film cooling. Additionally, {{through the use of}} micro-thermocouples, the thermal flow fields and wall temperatures are non-intrusively measured, with very small radiative errors. The film cooling flows are experimentally varied to cover a variety of breakdown regimes for both adiabatic (or idealized walls with no heat loss) and on-adiabatic walls (or walls with a carefully controlled heat loss through them). The subsequent experimental dataset is a unique and comprehensive set of turbulent measurements characterizing and demonstrating the film breakdown and the turbulent flow physics. The experiments are then numerically simulated using an in-house variable density, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) code developed as part of this dissertation. In addition to accurately predicting important turbulent kinematic and thermal flow phenomena, the <b>key</b> <b>wall</b> parameters were predicted to within 3 % for the adiabatic cases and to within 6 % for the non-adiabatic cases, with a few exceptions. Turbulent inflow techniques, crucial for the success of LES of film cooling, are examined. In addition to the turbulent flow physics, radiation and conduction physics at the wall were also simulated with good fidelity. The combined experimental and numerical approach was used to uniquely form a comprehensive study, examining many aspects of film cooling phenomena relevant for engineering applications...|$|E

40|$|Rate-zonal {{centrifugation}} of pea (Pisum sativum var. Alaska) stem microsomal membranes on {{a linear}} Renografln gradient separated Golgi secretory ves-icles from dictyosomes. Secretory vesicles possessed {{high levels of}} xyloglucan fucosyl transferase activity, which effects the final decoration of stem xyloglucan side-chains, but lacked substantial xyloglucan xylo-syl transferase activity, which {{is required for the}} synthesis of the xyloglucan backbone. In contrast, total dictyosomal membranes possessed both fucosyl and xylosyl transferase activities. Isopycnic centrifu-gation of a homogenized dictyosome-enriched mem-brane preparation on a shallower Renografln gradi-ent indicated that lighter dictyosomal membranes possessed xylosyl transferase but relatively little fucosyl transferase activity. The bulk of the dictyoso-mal membranes formed a denser peak in which xylosyl and fucosyl transferase activities codistri-buted. Thus a differential localization of function in the Golgi apparatus during biosynthesis of xyloglu-can is indicated. A tentative mechanism is suggested in which the elaboration of the glucose-xylose back-bone is initiated in lighter dictyosomal membranes, backbone synthesis is concluded and fucosylation begun in denser dictyosomal membranes, and fucos-ylation completed in Golgi secretory vesicles during transport of xyloglucan to the cell <b>wall.</b> <b>Key</b> words: cell <b>wall</b> synthesis, Golgi, fucosyl transferase...|$|R

40|$|In {{the sixties}} Prof. J. Witteveen {{introduced}} a discrete {{model for the}} elastic analysis of slabs (Heron 1966). This article presents a similar approach {{for the design of}} reinforced concrete walls and deep beams, with holes or otherwise. The model – which is called stringer-panel model – combines the advantages of the popular strut-and-tie method and the standard finite element method. It has the same geometry as the plastic model proposed by Prof. M. P. Nielsen in the seventies (Kærn 1979). However, the stringer-panel model accurately uses the non-linear behaviour of reinforced concrete. So, it encompasses both the elastic and plastic states. The method provides crack width information in the serviceability limit state and allows for redistribution of forces in the ultimate limit state. A design example shows the usability of the model in engineering practice. <b>Key</b> words: <b>Wall,</b> structural concrete, stringer-panel, strut-and-tie, computer aided design...|$|R
