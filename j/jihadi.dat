25|$|In late August, 2016: A <b>Jihadi</b> website {{released}} {{series of}} sermons by al-Zawahiri regarding Jihad.|$|E
25|$|Masood's profile was {{atypical}} in {{that most}} <b>jihadi</b> terrorists are under 30, {{while he was}} 52.|$|E
25|$|The Al-Nusra Front however denied responsibility, {{saying the}} video was a fake {{and that any}} {{information}} regarding their operations would be announced through <b>Jihadi</b> forums. Al Nusra denied responsibility for the attack.|$|E
25|$|Whether Assad stays or goes, jihadism now has {{a strong}} {{foothold}} in Syria. The Free Syrian Army may wish to dismiss its al-Qaeda allies as irrelevant in order to reassure the West and continue receiving Western support, but the <b>jihadi</b> websites and footage of al-Qaeda fighting in Damascus and Aleppo tell a different story.|$|E
25|$|Umarov {{denied that}} Chechen {{separatism}} {{is linked to}} al-Qaeda or any other international <b>jihadi</b> groups, saying that the rebels' priority is liberty and independence from Russia and peace for the Caucasus. Prior to his 2007 declaration of the Caucasus Emirate, Umarov was commonly viewed as a staunch Chechen nationalist and had been expected to rather curb the pan-Islamist tendencies in the Chechen separatist movement.|$|E
25|$|The assailants were {{suspected}} {{to belong}} to the Islamic terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba. The investigating team tracked the phone calls made from the cell phones carried by the terrorits using the IMEI numbers. The Police recovered a single RPG-7 rocket-propelled grenade launcher, five Type 56 assault rifles, five M1911 pistols, several M67 grenades and some <b>jihadi</b> documents. Rehan Alam, the jeep driver, was detained by the police for further investigations.|$|E
25|$|However, most {{religious}} systems acknowledge {{an afterlife}} and improving this {{is seen as}} an even more basic good. In many other moral systems, also, remaining on Earth in a state that lacks honor or power over self is less desirable— consider seppuku in bushido, kamikazes or the role of suicide attacks in <b>Jihadi</b> rhetoric. In all these systems, remaining on Earth is perhaps no higher than a third-place value.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{some analysts}} {{maintain}} {{that whatever the}} source of modern <b>Jihadi</b> terrorism and the actions and words of some rogue members, the Brotherhood now has {{little in common with}} radical Islamists and modern jihadists who often condemn the Brotherhood as too moderate. They also deny the existence of any centralized and secretive global Muslim Brotherhood leadership. Some claim that the origins of modern Muslim terrorism are found in Wahhabi ideology, not that of the Muslim Brotherhood.|$|E
25|$|Egypt's Sinai Peninsula borders the Gaza Strip and Israel. Its {{vast and}} desolate terrain has {{transformed}} {{it into a}} hotbed of illicit and militant activity. Although most of the area's inhabitants are tribal Bedouins, {{there has been a}} recent increase in al-Qaeda inspired global <b>jihadi</b> militant groups operating in the region. Out of the approximately 15 main militant groups operating in the Sinai desert, the most dominant and active militant groups have close relations with the Gaza Strip.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, al-Zawahiri {{married his}} first wife, Azza Ahmed Nowari, {{a student at}} Cairo University who was {{studying}} philosophy. Their wedding, which {{was held at the}} Continental Hotel in Opera Square, was very conservative, with separate areas for both men and women, and no music, photographs, or light-hearted humour. Many years later, when the United States attacked Afghanistan following the September 11 attacks in October 2001, Azza apparently had no idea that al-Zawahiri had supposedly been a <b>jihadi</b> emir (commander) for the last decade. In June 2012, one of Zawahiri's four wives, Umaima Hassan, released a statement on the internet congratulating the role played by Muslim women in the Arab Spring.|$|E
25|$|Often {{viewed as}} a {{minority}} figure in his own times and in the centuries that followed, Ibn Taymiyyah {{has become one of}} the most influential medieval writers in contemporary Islam, where his particular interpretations of the Qur'an and the Sunnah and his rejection of some aspects of classical Islamic tradition are believed to have had considerable influence on contemporary Wahhabism, Salafism, and Jihadism. Indeed, particular aspects of his teachings had a profound influence on Muhammad ibn Abd al-Wahhab, the founder of the Hanbali reform movement practiced in Saudi Arabia known as Wahhabism, and on other later Wahabi scholars. Moreover, Ibn Taymiyyah's controversial fatwa allowing jihad against other Muslims is referenced to by Al-Qaeda and other <b>jihadi</b> groups.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rebels}} in al-Yaarubiyah were forced on the defensive, Ahrar al-Jazeera {{fell out of}} favor with the other rebel groups, and was {{forcibly}} expelled from the town on charges that it was corrupt. As result, al-Yaarubiyah was left {{under the control of}} four <b>Jihadi</b> groups by October 2013: The al-Nusra Front, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Ansar al-Khilafa, and Liwa al-Tawhid wa al-Jihad. Their rule was harsh, as locals were forbidden from listening to music and forced to fast and pray, while dissidents were either imprisoned or beheaded. Food prices increased and fuel became scarce. In response to these policies and the fighting in the area, most of the town's population fled to YPG territories. Eventually, a delegation of 90 leading tribesmen from al-Yaarubiyah asked the YPG to drive the rebels from the town, to which the militia responded positively.|$|E
25|$|In 2002, the Musharraf-led {{government}} took a firm {{stand against the}} <b>jihadi</b> organizations and groups promoting extremism, and arrested Maulana Masood Azhar, head of the Jaish-e-Mohammed, and Hafiz Muhammad Saeed, chief of the Lashkar-e-Taiba, and took dozens of activists into custody. An official ban was imposed on the groups on 12 January. Later that year, the Saudi born Zayn al-Abidn Muhammed Hasayn Abu Zubaydah was arrested by Pakistani officials during a series of joint U.S.-Pakistan raids. Zubaydah {{is said to have}} been a high-ranking al-Qaeda official with the title of operations chief and in charge of running al-Qaeda training camps. Other prominent al-Qaeda members were arrested in the following two years, namely Ramzi bin al-Shibh, who is known to have been a financial backer of al-Qaeda operations, and Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who at the time of his capture was the third highest-ranking official in al-Qaeda and had been directly in charge of the planning for the 11 September attacks.|$|E
500|$|On 16 February 2015, Egyptian F-16s struck <b>jihadi</b> weapons caches and {{training}} camps in Libya in {{revenge of the}} murder of 21 workers by masked militants affiliated with the Islamic State (ISIS). [...] The air strikes killed 64 ISIS fighters, including three leaders in Derna and Sirte on the coast.|$|E
500|$|The {{causes of}} the decline in Crusading and the failure of the Crusader States is multi-faceted. Historians have {{attempted}} to explain this in terms of Muslim reunification and <b>Jihadi</b> enthusiasm but Thomas Asbridge, amongst others, considers this too simplistic. Muslim unity was sporadic and the desire for Jihad ephemeral. The nature of Crusades was unsuited to the conquest and defence of the Holy Land. Crusaders were on a personal pilgrimage and usually returned when it was completed. Although the philosophy of Crusading changed over time, the Crusades continued to provide short lived armies without centralised leadership led by independently minded potentates. What the Crusader states needed were large standing armies. Religious fervour enabled amazing feats of military endeavour but proved difficult to direct and control. Succession disputes and dynastic rivalries in Europe, failed harvests and heretical outbreaks, all contributed to reducing Latin Europe's concerns for Jerusalem. Ultimately, even though the fighting was also {{at the edge of the}} Islamic world, the huge distances made the mounting of Crusades and the maintenance of communications insurmountably difficult. It enabled Islam, under the charismatic leadership of Nur al-Din and Saladin as well as the ruthless Baibars to use the logistical advantages from proximity to victorious effect. The mainland Crusader states of the [...] outremer [...] were finally extinguished with the fall of Tripoli in 1289 and Acre in 1291. Many Latin Christians were evacuated to Cyprus by boat, were killed or enslaved.|$|E
2500|$|The Qur'an: (8:12): [...] "...cast {{terror in}} their hearts and strike upon their necks." [...] The phrase {{that they have been}} [...] "commanded to terrorize the disbelievers" [...] has been cited in {{motivation}} of <b>Jihadi</b> terror. One <b>Jihadi</b> cleric has said: ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2009 Little Rock {{military}} recruiting office shooting – al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula-inspired {{attack by}} Yemen-trained <b>jihadi</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|For Al-Qaeda and Pakistani <b>jihadi</b> groups, Siddiqui's case {{became a}} [...] "rallying cry" [...] and they joined in accusing the Pakistani {{government}} and military {{of failing to}} protect and avenge her.|$|E
2500|$|On state television, actors {{simulated}} [...] "weddings" [...] between jihad martyrs and heavenly virgins (houris) {{on state}} television. Turabi also gave asylum and assistance to non-Sudanese <b>jihadi,</b> including bin Laden and other Al Qaeda members.|$|E
2500|$|Abdel Bari Atwan, the {{editor-in-chief}} of the London-based pan-Arab newspaper Al-Quds Al-Arabi, wrote that: Most of the effective surveillance work tracking <b>jihadi</b> sites is being done not by the FBI or MI6, but by private groups. The best-known and most successful of those are [...] Haganah ... SITE ... and Jihad Watch.|$|E
2500|$|In 1984, the Reagan administration, {{which had}} {{significantly}} expanded the CIA-run program of funding the <b>Jihadi</b> militants in Afghanistan, employed the term [...] "war against terrorism" [...] {{to pass legislation}} aimed at countering terrorist groups {{in the wake of}} the 1983 Beirut barracks bombing that killed 241 U.S. and 58 French peacekeepers.|$|E
2500|$|... 3) [...] "Home of the Brave" [...] – A {{journey through}} America on a {{motorcycle}} to find rebels, revolutionaries and militias. Pelton visits with country & western singer Willie Nelson, Native American activist Russell Means, motorcycle icon Peter Fonda and finds an American <b>jihadi</b> Aukai Collins who trained in terrorist training camps run by Osama bin Laden ...|$|E
2500|$|In Pakistan, [...] Prime Minister Yousaf Raza Gillani and {{opposition}} leader Nawaz Sharif promised {{to push for}} her release. Pakistani news media called the trial a [...] "farce," [...] while other Pakistanis labeled this reaction [...] "knee-jerk Pakistani nationalism". [...] As of 2014, ISIS, the Taliban and other <b>Jihadi</b> groups have offered to release hostages in exchange for her.|$|E
2500|$|In this sketch, the Ronnie Johns team {{employed}} {{two children}} {{to act in}} a [...] "G.I. Joe" [...] style commercial for the [...] "Jihadi Joe" [...] action figure. The sketch involved two toy twin towers which the kids then crash a plane into and begin to celebrate (à la 9/11). The sketch then turns to heaven where <b>Jihadi</b> Joe is rewarded with 72 virgins.|$|E
2500|$|Robert Young Pelton [...] "The Hunter, The Hammer and Heaven" [...] "The Hammer is a {{first hand}} account of Pelton's journey into Grozny in December 1999 with an American <b>jihadi,</b> a young {{journalist}} and his cameraman. They were surrounded in Grozny, Shali and Dubya Yrt and came out. Pelton interviewed the captured Russian spy Aleksei Galkin {{and all of the}} top Chechen commanders including President Aslan Maskhadov.|$|E
2500|$|... 4) [...] "Inside Afghanistan" [...] – In {{his first}} post 9/11 show Pelton re-enters Afghanistan, {{this time he}} is only outside witness to war with a Special Forces team that fights on horseback with a brutal warlord, General Rashid Dostum. He is {{in the battle of}} Qali Jangi and finds an American <b>jihadi</b> named John Walker Lindh, {{introducing}} the world to the first American al Qaeda member ever interviewed on the battlefield ...|$|E
2500|$|While Haq's {{violence}} exploded {{inside a}} political context — the Jewish Federation, Israel's war in Lebanon — his motivations {{were those of}} a frustrated man, who, according to [...] Renner, didn't fit in anywhere and felt persecuted and embarrassed by his parents' Pakistani background. Haq is not a <b>jihadi,</b> nor a radical Islamist; his anti-Semitic rhetoric seems more like a veneer of politics on a man disturbed by feelings of inadequacy and rejection.|$|E
2500|$|At {{the same}} time, al-Qaeda ideologues {{instructed}} the network's recruiters {{to look for}} <b>Jihadi</b> international Muslims who believed that extremist-jihad must be fought on a global level. The concept of a [...] "global Salafi jihad" [...] had been around {{since at least the}} early 1980s. Several groups had formed for the explicit purpose of driving non-Muslims out of every Muslim land {{at the same time and}} with maximum carnage. This was, however, a fundamentally defensive strategy.|$|E
2500|$|The video also {{appeared}} to validate that al-Qaeda was closely monitoring U.S. political developments, especially including {{the work of the}} September 11 Commission, which Kean chaired. [...] It also suggested that al-Qaeda intended to focus not just on engaging the West in Iraq, but also in other countries. [...] "As for {{the second half of the}} long-term plan," [...] al-Zawahri says on the video, [...] "it consists of hurrying to the fields of Jihad like Afghanistan, Iraq and Somalia for <b>Jihadi</b> preparation and training." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2014, Seattle-based Deep Web and Dark web {{monitoring}} firm Flashpoint Global Partners {{published a}} report that found [...] "very little open source information available via <b>jihadi</b> online social media" [...] indicating that Snowden's leaks impelled al-Qaeda to develop more secure digital communications. [...] "The underlying public encryption methods employed by online jihadists," [...] the report concluded, [...] "do {{not appear to have}} significantly changed since the emergence of Edward Snowden. Major recent technological advancements have focused primarily on expanding the use of encryption to instant messenger and mobile communications mediums." ...|$|E
2500|$|As of March 2015, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (or ISIS/ISIL, Daesh), a Salafi <b>jihadi</b> extremist {{militant group}} and self-proclaimed {{caliphate}} and Islamic state led by Sunni Arabs from Iraq and Syria, had control over territory occupied by ten {{million people in}} Iraq and Syria, as well as limited territorial control in some other countries. The United Nations has held ISIS responsible for human rights abuses and war crimes, and Amnesty International has reported ethnic cleansing by the group on a [...] "historic scale", including attacks on Shia Muslims.|$|E
2500|$|Within {{weeks of}} the {{commencement}} of the coalition's campaign, AQAP had exploited the chaos to capture the south-eastern port city of Mukalla, along with nearby military, transport, and economic infrastructure. A series of prison breaks by al-Qaeda – they emptied Mukalla's jail of 300 prisoners and loosed 1,200 inmates in June 2015 from the central prison in Taiz – released jailed jihadists of all ranks. Worse, Yemen's prisons had, in preceding years, reportedly become [...] "de facto <b>jihadi</b> academies", as veteran militants were placed in cells alongside young, regular criminals.|$|E
2500|$|There is {{no doubt}} that the case of an ultraconservative, educated middle-class Pakistani woman who shunned the ways of the West and defied America has {{resonated}} with the Pakistani public. ... All of this has taken place with little national soul-searching about the contradictory and frequently damning circumstances surrounding Ms. Siddiqui, who is suspected of having had links to Al Qaeda and the banned <b>jihadi</b> group Jaish-e-Muhammad. Instead, the Pakistani news media have broadly portrayed her trial as a [...] "farce", and an example of the injustices meted out to Muslims by the United States since Sept. 11, 2001.|$|E
2500|$|On 19 August, a North Sinai {{security}} {{official said}} that ten Yemeni militants infiltrated the country two {{months prior to the}} attack and trained local <b>jihadi</b> cells in the Sinai. He stated that Egypt had received intelligence that these militants were communicating with jihadist groups in Al Mukataa, south of Sheikh Zuwayed. Bedouin leader Ibrahim Al Menei said that the Yemeni militants were smuggled in from Sudan with African migrants, and that word spread among the community. [...] Another Bedouin leader, Salem Aneizan, also said that he heard the Yemeni militants were training jihadists in North Sinai.|$|E
2500|$|Journalist Scroggins {{complained about}} the lack of curiosity and {{investigation}} [...] by Pakistani public and press of a number of questions about the case—how Siddiqui's daughter Maryam turned up at her grandmother's house and where she had been, what connection the [...] "Karachi Institute of Technology", and the cleric Abu Lubaba had had with Aafia. She noted that while thousands of Pakistanis had been killed by bomb and assassinations in tribal areas, in contrast to the rage against the US, no rallies were held in protest of <b>jihadi</b> attacks (Scroggins argued) because Pakistanis were fearful of them.|$|E
2500|$|This {{activity}} and his views {{in support of}} the German government's colonial ambitions caused considerable mistrust among the British in Egypt, worried about German designs on the country (which had become a de facto protectorate in 1882), the Suez canal and the lifeline to their possessions in India. The British press repeatedly agitated against him, even styling him a [...] "master spy of the Kaiser". For example, when tensions were later heightened by the Aqaba border crisis, 1906, British and French papers accused Oppenheim of acting in ways to incite pan-Islamic <b>jihadi</b> massacres of Europeans and of plotting with anti-French Algerian, and anti-Italian Tripolitan, rebels.|$|E
