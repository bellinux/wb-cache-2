5|$|The energy {{needed to}} build a wind farm divided into the total output over its life, <b>Energy</b> <b>Return</b> on Energy Invested, of wind power varies but averages about 20–25. Thus, the energy payback time is {{typically}} around one year.|$|E
5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} to the energy payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or <b>energy</b> <b>return</b> on investment (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same as}} the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E
5|$|The sand {{devil is}} an ambush {{predator}} that spends much time {{buried in the}} bottom sediment. Its diet consists mainly of demersal teleost fishes such as croakers, goatfishes, and butterfishes. However, some types of demersal fishes such as jacks are rarely eaten, perhaps {{because they are more}} active and thus likely to escape attacks. Squid are a major secondary food source, particularly for smaller sharks. Crabs, shrimp, mantis shrimp, skates, and bivalves are infrequently eaten. This species feeds both during the day and at night. It tends to select prey approximately 50–60% as long as its mouth is wide; this size is consistent with what is predicted from optimal foraging theory to yield the most efficient rate of <b>energy</b> <b>return.</b> The variety of prey taken is greatest in fall and least in winter, and smaller sharks have a more varied diet than larger ones. In the northern Gulf of Mexico, the most important prey species are Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus), longspine porgy (Stenotomus caprinus), spot croaker (Leiostomus xanthurus), Gulf butterfish (Peprilus burti), red goatfish (Mullus auratus), dwarf goatfish (Upeneus parvus), and longfin inshore squid (Doryteuthis pealeii). The relative importance of each differs across seasons (for example, squid are more important in winter), perhaps due to seasonal variation in their availability. A known parasite of the sand devil is the copepod Eudactylina spinula.|$|E

25|$|The {{ratio of}} energy {{extracted}} {{to the energy}} expended in the process {{is often referred to}} as the <b>Energy</b> <b>Return</b> on Energy Investment (EROI or EROEI). Should the EROEI drops to one, or equivalently the Net energy gain falls to zero, the oil production is no longer a net energy source.|$|E
25|$|Large {{and swift}} mammals are stalked and shot with bow and arrow. Smaller and {{burrowing}} mammals are usually captured by hand. Because Aché hunting {{has been extensively}} studied using focal follow and other systematic methods, the encounter rates with prey, the time required for a successful pursuit, and the expected energy gains from prey types, are all well known. This has allowed for numerous tests of specific decision models from Optimal Foraging Theory to be tested using Aché data. Results generally {{support the notion that}} Aché hunters pursue only those prey types that would increase their <b>energy</b> <b>return</b> rates, and pass by some species (many small birds, rodents, reptiles, etc.) that would probably lower overall foraging returns if pursued.|$|E
2500|$|A key {{concept of}} energy {{economics}} is net energy gain, which recognizes that all energy requires energy to produce. [...] To be useful the <b>energy</b> <b>return</b> on energy invested (EROEI) {{has to be}} greater than one. [...] The net energy gain from production coal, oil and gas has declined over time as the easiest to produce sources have been most heavily depleted.|$|E
40|$|This study {{tested the}} {{assumption}} that variation in the energy value of different instars of a hemimetabolous insect makes no ecologically significant difference to rates of energy gain by its vertebrate predators and {{found it to be}} supported. Three mammal species, four bird species and a lizard species were used as predators and one grasshopper species as prey. Although instars of both male and female grasshoppers differed significantly in energy values, the <b>energy</b> <b>returns</b> to their predators based on these exact values were qualitatively similar to those produced when a commonly-used constant energy value of 23 J/mg dry weight was substituted. Regressions of specific <b>energy</b> <b>returns</b> on those based on the 23 J/mg constant were highly significant, so <b>energy</b> <b>returns</b> based on the constant were good predictors of those based on specific energy values. Although significant intraspecific variations in energy values occur in Acrida conica and probably in other hemimetabolous insects as well, the 23 J/mg dry weight constant appears adequate for most predation studies...|$|R

2500|$|According to a transatlantic {{collaborative}} research paper on <b>Energy</b> <b>return</b> on energy Invested(EROEI), conducted by 6 analysts {{and led by}} D.

As when corrected for their weather intermittency/"buffered", the EROEI figures for intermittent energy sources as stated in the paper is diminished - a reduction of EROEI dependent on how reliant they are on back up energy sources.|$|E
2500|$|The Coal Question; An Inquiry Concerning the Progress of the Nation, and the Probable Exhaustion of Our Coal Mines (1865) {{was a book}} by {{economist}} William Stanley Jevons that {{explored the}} implications of Britain's reliance on coal.

[...] "Are we ," [...] he asked rhetorically, [...] "in allowing the commerce of this country to rise beyond the point at which we can long maintain it?" [...] His central thesis was that the supremacy of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland over global affairs was transitory, given the finite nature of its primary energy resource. In propounding this thesis, Jevons covered a range of issues central to sustainability, including limits to growth, overpopulation, overshoot, <b>energy</b> <b>return</b> on energy input (EROEI), taxation of energy resources, renewable energy alternatives, and resource peakinga subject widely discussed today under the rubric of peak oil.|$|E
50|$|Another {{issue with}} EROI that many studies attempt to tackle {{is that the}} <b>energy</b> <b>returned</b> can be in {{different}} forms, and these forms can have different utility.

50|$|An {{important}} constraint in teleceptive active sensory {{systems is}} generating <b>energy</b> with <b>return</b> signal above threshold of detection.
