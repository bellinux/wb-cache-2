5|$|However, the Crimson Tide {{were unable}} to {{capitalize}} on the drive that ensued after Kenyan Drake fumbled the ball at the goal line and was recovered by the Vols' Cameron Sutton.

This time Landon Collins made the play at the 11-yard line and returned it 89-yards for a touchdown and a 35–0 halftime lead.

At {{the end of the first}} quarter, Texas led 7–0. Early in the second quarter, Texas added another three points with a 52-yard field <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> came off of an interception. But the Hokies began to fight back. Brian Still returned a Texas punt 60yards for Tech's first points of the game, and at halftime, the Longhorns' lead was cut to just threepoints.|$|E

5|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} its next two {{possessions}} as well, and McCarron completed touchdown passes to running backs Kenyan Drake and Jalston Fowler. With the lead at 35–0 {{late in the}} second quarter, Alabama played its reserves {{for much of the}} remainder of the game. After the Crimson Tide defense forced another punt from the Panthers, McCarron was replaced by backup quarterback Blake Sims. On his first possession at the helm of Alabama's offense, Sims led the team to the Georgia State one-yard line, but a pair of false starts forced Alabama to settle for a field <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> increased the lead to 38–0 at halftime.|$|E

With 9:29 remaining, Virginia Tech's offense entered the game.

5|$|With the Tennessee defense {{stopping}} the Tide on consecutive drives, Alabama's defense responded with Mark Barron intercepting a Jonathan Crompton pass at the Bama 19 {{in the first}} quarter.

5|$|A five team group stage then followed, {{in which}} each team played the others once. Manchester City were drawn with Twente, Schalke 04, Racing de Santander and Paris Saint-Germain. City topped the group, after wins against Twente and Schalke, a draw with Paris Saint-Germain and a defeat in a dead rubber in Santander. The {{knockout}} stages then resumed, with a visit to F.C. Copenhagen in freezing conditions. City took the lead twice but could only draw 2–2. The home leg was more comfortable, and ended in a 2–1 victory. Another Danish club, Aalborg, awaited in the next round. Both matches finished 2–0 to the home side, and the tie was decided by a penalty shootout, which Manchester City won. City then faced Hamburger SV, in their first European quarter-final since 1979. The away leg was played first, and started exceptionally well for Manchester City, as Stephen Ireland scored after just 35 seconds. However, Hamburg soon equalised, and won the match 3–1. A difficult task in the home leg soon became even harder, when Hamburg scored an away goal early in the match. City scored twice, the first by Elano, who also hit the woodwork on two occasions with free-kicks. However, City could not produce the third <b>goal</b> <b>that</b> would have taken the tie into extra time.|$|E

Following a Florida three and out on their first possession, Alabama responded with an 8-play, 76-yard touchdown drive. On the drive, Greg McElroy completed key passes to Colin Peek and Marquis Maze and Mark Ingram rushed for 37 yards and the touchdown in taking a 9–0 lead following a missed extra point.
