5|$|Altitudinal {{migration}} {{is a form}} of short distance migration in which birds spend the breeding season at higher altitudes and move to lower ones during suboptimal conditions. It is most often triggered by temperature changes and usually occurs when the normal territories also become inhospitable due to lack of food. Some species may also be nomadic, <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> fixed territory and moving according to weather and food availability. Parrots as a family are overwhelmingly neither migratory nor sedentary but considered to either be dispersive, irruptive, nomadic or undertake small and irregular migrations.|$|E
5|$|There are differing {{levels of}} {{qualification}} that the ambulance crew may hold, from <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> formal qualification to having a fully qualified doctor on board. Most ambulance services require at least two crew members to be on every ambulance (one to drive, and one to attend the patient), although response cars may have a sole crew member, possibly backed up by another double-crewed ambulance. It {{may be the case}} that only the attendant need be qualified, and the driver might have no medical training. In some locations, an advanced life support ambulance may be crewed by one paramedic and one EMT-Basic.|$|E

25|$|The {{company was}} legally based in Genoa, Italy, with its {{headquarters}} in Mandello. The very earliest motorcycles bore the name G.P. (Guzzi-Parodi), though the marque quickly changed to Moto Guzzi. As the only actual shareholders, the Parodi's wanted to shield their shipping fortunes by avoiding confusion of name G.P. with Giorgio Parodi's initials. Carlo Guzzi initially received royalties for each motorcycle produced, <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> ownership in the company that bore his name. In 1946 Moto Guzzi formally incorporated as Moto Guzzi S.p.A. with Giorgio Parodi as chairman.|$|E

A long time ago, people said that “God’s Son” cast an immortal curse on him. <b>Holding</b> <b>no</b> clear intention, he’s just a monster that simply does what he feels like.

Stalin, {{former mayor of}} Chennai and former Deputy Chief minister of Tamil Nadu, for succeeding him {{as the leader of}} Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) Azhagiri shifted his base to Madurai during 1989 and did not hold any post officially in the party. In spite of <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> posts, he was all in command in the Madurai region and senior leaders in the party were unhappy about the factionalism created within the party. The DMK general secretary, K Anbazhagan, in 2001, directed the party men to have any contact with Azhagiri. During the period of 2008, Azhagiri was instrumental in the party winning three by-elections, the notable of which was Thirumangalam, where the party won with a massive difference. Based on the victory, Azhagiri was appointed as the organizing secretary of the party for southern districts. Following the by-poll victories in the state, Azhagiri was given the ticket for Madurai Lok Sabha Constituency in 2009 general elections, which he won eventually and later {{went on to become a}} cabinet minister.|$|E
25|$|Contrary to Brunei and Malaysia, a major {{component}} of Malayness — fealty to a ruling sultan — was removed from the modern Indonesian republican ideology. The formation of the Java-centered Indonesia saw the effective destruction of the functioning of the Malay sultanates. Indonesian republican outlook regard monarchy as a form of ancient feudalism and incompatible to modern democratic statehood envisioned by Indonesian founding fathers. The movement against ruling monarch mainly led by leftist and nationalist that seek to dismantle traditional royal institution. In March 1946, a major uprising breaks out against several Malay-Muslim Sultanates and rich Malay classes in East Sumatra, removing the traditional feudal social structure in the region. Today, several regional kingdoms or sultanate survive, despite <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> actual political power and without real authority, being replaced by provincial governatorial administration. The exception is Javanese Yogyakarta Sultanate that won special region status, mostly owed to the sultanate's bid and support for Indonesian Republic during Indonesian National Revolution. These sultanates and kingdoms are only recognised as the custody of local culture, arts and traditions, although they might still enjoyed prestiges and held in high esteem especially among local community.|$|E

25|$|The Church of Scotland (or Kirk) is {{the largest}} {{religious}} denomination in Scotland, however, unlike the Church of England it is Presbyterian and (since 1921) not {{a branch of the}} state, with the Sovereign <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> formal role in the Church other than being an ordinary member. However, though the Kirk is disestablished, Scotland is not a secular polity. The Kirk remains a national church to which the state has special obligations; it is conventional that the monarch, who is head of state, must attend the Church when she visits Scotland, and they swear in their accession oath to maintain and preserve the church. The state also gives numerous preferences to the Church of Scotland and Catholic Church, particularly in education. The blasphemy law has not been abolished in Scotland, though it has fallen into disuse. Non-religious couples can have a civil wedding with no religious elements, and humanist weddings have been legally recognised since 2005, and enshrined in Scottish law since 2017. Collective worship makes prayer and worship of a Christian character mandatory in all schools, but parents can remove their children from these lessons, though sixth formers have no right to opt out.|$|E

Orrec, <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> belief in the Ald god, is not allowed within the Gand's residence, but performs before an open pavilion. The relationship between the Gand Iorath and his son Iddor is seen to be tense: Iddor believes Orrec's poetry to be blasphemy. Some of Ansul's citizens, led by Sulter's friend Desac, hope to rouse the city against the Alds, taking advantage of the struggle between the Gand and his son. Desac asks Orrec to act as an instigator for a rebellion. When Orrec hesitates, the Waylord offers to consult the Oracle, revealed to still be in the house, about a rebellion. He tells Memer that their family has the responsibility of [...] "reading" [...] the Oracle, which provides answers in the pages of certain books in the secret room. He asks the Oracle about the rebellion: Memer sees the phrase [...] "Broken mend broken" [...] in a book in response.|$|E

The roadies of the Dead dosed the food and drinks of {{as many people as}} possible with LSD, <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> compunction about the practice as they felt [...] "evangelical" [...] about the substance. The stage was very crowded with the Dead's entourage, and roadie Kim Payne instructed driver Tuffy Phillips to let no one onstage. When Capricorn promotional chief Dick Wooley attempted to get onstage, Phillips punched Wooley in the nose. Wooley competed in martial arts and began punching back. When all three roadies engaged in the fight, the Dead's security (the Hell's Angels) assumed Wooley a [...] "bad guy" [...] and they joined. Soon, the Grateful Dead's roadies realized the situation at hand and they pulled Wooley from the pile.|$|E

500|$|By 1952, McGovern {{was coming}} to {{think of himself as}} a Democrat. He was captivated by a radio {{broadcast}} of Governor Adlai Stevenson's speech accepting the presidential nomination at the 1952 Democratic National Convention [...] He immediately dedicated himself to Stevenson's campaign, publishing seven articles in the Mitchell Daily Republic newspaper outlining the historical issues that separated the Democratic Party from the Republicans. The McGoverns named their only son Steven, born immediately after the convention, after his new hero. Although Stevenson lost the election, McGovern remained active in politics, believing that [...] "the engine of progress in our time in America is the Democratic Party". In early 1953, McGovern left a tenure-track position at the university to become executive secretary of the South Dakota Democratic Party, the state chair having recruited him after reading his articles. Democrats in the state were at a low, <b>holding</b> <b>no</b> statewide offices and only 2 of the 110 seats in the state legislature.
