30|$|The {{analysis}} results of Sect.  4.1 {{show that the}} two representative predictive equations for the joint shear strength do not correctly estimate the experimental results of this study. The AASHTO equation of Eq. (1) originally developed for the <b>dry</b> <b>joint</b> without epoxy largely underestimated the strengths measured in various joint conditions. Figure  8 a shows that the AASHTO equation may even result in a lower value than that measured in a <b>dry</b> <b>joint</b> without epoxy. Therefore, it should be careful to apply the AASHTO equation to estimate the joint shear strength of UHPC because this equation shows too much conservatism. Furthermore, Eq. (1) does not include a coefficient that can be adjusted to match the test results of UHPC.|$|R

Complementarily, the application of an existing numerical model, stemming from plasticity and based on a micromodeling strategy, is also presented and discussed with regard to its capacity to simulate the obtained experimental results. The model was calibrated with data collected from complementary tests carried out on specimens and prisms made of the same type of stone.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} support the {{optimization}} of mortarless brick linings of steel producing furnaces it is proposed in this paper to investigate only the compressibility of <b>dry</b> refractory <b>joints.</b> To this end, optical measurements based on the Digital Image Correlation method were carried out during compression of Magnesia-Carbon brick samples with <b>dry</b> <b>joints.</b> The second main objective is to assess {{the accuracy of the}} secant linearization schemes (the classical secant procedure and its modified extension) to reproduce the reference local and global behaviour of refractory mortarless linings accounting for the identified inelastic convex powerlaw behaviour of the Magnesia-Carbon <b>dry</b> <b>joint.</b> The reference nonlinear solution is obtained by means of finite elements method. Under normal compressive loading, unlike for usual (concave) power-law viscoplastic composites for which the secant schemes are known to provide too stiff results, {{it was found that the}} modified secant scheme leads to good overall predictions. The classical secant procedure underestimates the reference local and overall behaviour. To improve the latter result, an empirical improved secant formulation was proposed and implemented. It leads to better estimates at local and global levels...|$|R

40|$|International audienceMany bottom linings of {{refractory}} ceramic structures used in steel making industry {{are made of}} masonries with or without mortar. Several designs are possible, parallel, fish bone or radial, with different joint thicknesses and different refractory materials. To compare the influence of these designs {{on the level of}} stress and displacements in the outside steel shell, the different masonries were modelled by an equivalent homogeneous material. The thermo-mechanical properties of this equivalent material were determined using a periodic homogenization method. They are temperature depending and depend of the joint states in the case of masonries with <b>dry</b> <b>joints</b> (i. e. without mortar).

30|$|The {{reasons for}} this {{difference}} in the failure loads between {{the two types of}} joints can be analyzed from two points of view. First, the strength of the cast-in-place UHPC of the wet joint would be prone to slightly decrease when compared to that of precast UHPC due to the unexpected inferior curing condition. Secondly, referring to Fig.  2, the wet joint accompanies more weak points in terms of stress concentration, such as the corners of the shear keys, than those of the <b>dry</b> <b>joint.</b> In fact, the failure mechanism of the wet joint often exhibits diagonal cracks and shear-off that connects two corners of the shear keys as shown in Fig.  4 a. Therefore, in the field application of the precast UHPC segments, the <b>dry</b> <b>joint</b> type is more recommended than the wet joint in terms of strength as well as constructability, although both the <b>dry</b> and wet <b>joints</b> are possible options in practice. The mixing and curing of UHPC cast at a construction site can often involve cumbersome tasks and technical difficulties especially when the air temperature is relatively high or low. However, superiority of the joint type needs to be further verified in terms of long-term loading including fatigue.|$|R

50|$|Movement {{of metals}} being {{soldered}} before the solder has cooled {{will cause a}} highly unreliable cracked joint. In electronics soldering terminology {{this is known as}} a 'dry' joint. It has a characteristically dull or grainy appearance immediately after the joint is made, rather than being smooth, bright and shiny. This appearance is caused by crystallization of the liquid solder. A <b>dry</b> <b>joint</b> is weak mechanically and a poor conductor electrically.|$|R
50|$|Wire wrap {{construction}} {{can produce}} assemblies {{which are more}} reliable than printed circuits: connections are less prone to fail due to vibration or physical stresses on the base board, {{and the lack of}} solder precludes soldering faults such as corrosion, cold <b>joints</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>joints.</b> The connections themselves are firmer and have lower electrical resistance due to cold welding of the wire to the terminal post at the corners.|$|R
30|$|Several {{measures}} have therefore {{been taken to}} ensure the continuity and integrity at the joints (Mohsen and Hiba 2007; Turmo et al. 2006). In general, two types of joints have been applied to precast UHPC structures similarly to ordinary concrete structures: a wet joint, where the joint is cast in-place with a selected material (Ishii et al. 2008; Matsubara et al. 2008; Park et al. 2013) and a <b>dry</b> <b>joint,</b> where the surfaces of two precast segments formed by match-casting are in direct contact. Figure  1 a shows {{an example of the}} wet joint cast in-place with UHPC. The <b>dry</b> <b>joints</b> include the epoxy-coated or epoxy-glued joints that improve the resistance to external loads and prevent the penetration of water from outside. Although the epoxy-coated joint is classified as a wet joint in some documents, the term ‘dry joint’ is consistently used in this study for match-cast joints regardless of application of the epoxy. Regardless of the type of joint employed, shear keys are often used at the joint to assist in carrying the design shear force at that location.|$|R

30|$|The test {{variables}} {{of this study}} are shown in Table  2. Both the <b>dry</b> <b>joint</b> and wet joint were designed. In the <b>dry</b> <b>joint,</b> the effect of epoxy on the strength improvement was investigated. The effectiveness of cast-in-place UHPC as a wet joint filler between UHPC segments {{was one of the main}} concerns. Basically, it can be expected that the strength of a joint needs to be similar to that of the main body to avoid the joint becoming a weak part. The number and height of shear keys were considered as variables to investigate the difference of failure mechanism and ultimate capacity at the joint. Three different curing temperatures of the UHPC filler of a wet joint were considered to account for the inferior condition of the construction site in terms of temperature control, when compared to a precast concrete plant where steam curing is available (Park et al. 2015). Lateral compressive stress was applied at several levels to account for various prestress introduced at the joint by the prestressing tendons that connect a number of segments. As explained earlier, shear keys having a 30  mm-height or shorter were used to investigate the improved performance of UHPC.|$|R
