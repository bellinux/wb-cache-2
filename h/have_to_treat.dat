500|$|Filming for {{the pilot}} took place at various {{locations}} in and around New York City in June 2009. In creating the visual effects for the series, the company turned to Brooklyn-based effects company Brainstorm Digital. Says Glenn Allen, visual effects producer for Boardwalk Empire and co-founder of Brainstorm, [...] "It's our most complex job to date. Everything is HD now, so we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> it like a feature film." [...] "Anytime you {{get to work on}} a period piece, it's more fun," [...] comments visual effects artist Chris [...] "Pinkus" [...] Wesselman, who used archival photographs, postcards, and architectural plans to recreate the Atlantic City boardwalks as accurately as possible. [...] "We got to explore what the old Atlantic City was really like. The piers were one of the toughest parts because every summer they would change – new houses, new advertisements." [...] It took two months for the firm to complete all the visual effects {{for the pilot}}.|$|E
500|$|Stylistically, {{the album}} has been {{described}} by Allrovi's Jason Lymangrover as ranging [...] "from Frank Sinatra pop to psychedelic garage rock"; while The Boston Globe James Reed has noted the [...] "spare" [...] sound of [...] "Scalinatella" [...] and the [...] "furious and rocking" [...] pace of [...] "Urlo Negro". Although wanting to remain faithful to the original versions of the songs covered, Patton wished to avoid simply mimicking the original recordings, stating [...] "this is a record of covers, and I believe firmly that you have to make them your own. There is a very fine line to tread. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> a song with respect, yet twist it up, fuck it up and somehow make it a part of your own voice". When assembling the cut for [...] "Deep Down", Patton was able {{to get in touch with}} the original vocalist, a woman named Christy, though mutual friend Daniele Luppi. However, she declined to take part in the project.|$|E
500|$|Spicer says [...] "Roger Moore re-created Bond as an old-style debonair hero, more {{polished}} and sophisticated than Connery's incarnation, using the mocking insouciance he had perfected {{in his role}} as Simon Templar... Moore's humour was a throwaway, and certainly in the later films, verged on self-parody. It was an essential strand in the increasingly tongue-in-cheek direction of the series which became more light-hearted, knowing and playfully intertextual". Chapman noted that Moore was the most comedic of the Bonds, with a more light-hearted approach to playing the character with a mocking wit and innuendo. Additionally, Moore's one-liners were delivered in a way to suggest that the violence inherent in the films was a joke, as opposed to Connery's, which was used to mitigate the violence. Moore explained his approach to the humour by saying [...] "to me, the Bond situations are so ridiculous... I mean, this man {{is supposed to be a}} spy, and yet everybody knows he's a spy... it's outrageous. So you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> the humour outrageously as well".|$|E

2500|$|Historian James J. Weingartner sees a {{connection}} between the American mutilation of Japanese war dead and the bombings. According to Weingartner both were partially the result of a dehumanization of the enemy. [...] "he widespread image of the Japanese as sub-human constituted an emotional context which provided another justification for decisions which resulted in the death of hundreds of thousands." [...] On the second day after the bombing of Nagasaki, President Truman had stated: [...] "The only language they seem to understand is the one we have been using to bombard them. When {{you have to deal with}} a beast you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> him like a beast. It is most regrettable but nevertheless true".|$|E

2500|$|In February 2013, Betabeat {{published}} a post that recognized {{the influx of}} multi-national corporations like Costco, Taco Bell, Subaru, and McDonald's posting branded content on Reddit that was made to appear {{as if it was}} original content from legitimate Reddit users. Reddit's former Director of Communications noted that while a large number of Chief Marketing Officers want to [...] "infiltrate the reddit community on behalf of their brand," [...] she emphasized that [...] "self-promotion is frowned upon" [...] and the site is [...] "100 percent organic." [...] She recommended that advertisers design promotions that [...] "spark conversations and feedback." [...] She recommended that businesses use AMAs to get attention for public figures but cautioned [...] "It is important to approach AMAs carefully and be aware that this may not be a fit for every project or client." [...] Nissan ran a successful Branded content promotion offering users free gifts to publicize a new car, though the company was later ridiculed for suspected astroturfing when the CEO only answered puff piece questions on the site. Taylor described these situations as [...] "high risk" [...] noting [...] "We try hard to educate people that they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> questions that may seem irreverent or out of left field the same as they would questions about the specific project they are promoting." ...|$|E

6000|$|... § 23. Farther, imaginative art always {{includes}} historical art; so that, strictly speaking, {{according to}} the analogy above used, we meet with the pure blue, and with the crimson ruling the blue and changing it into kingly purple, {{but not with the}} pure crimson: for all imagination must deal with the knowledge it has before accumulated; it never produces anything but by combination or contemplation. Creation, in the full sense, is impossible to it. And the mode in which the historical faculties are included by it is often quite simple, and easily seen. Thus, in Hunt's great poetical picture of the Light of the World, the whole thought and arrangement of the picture being imaginative, the several details of it are wrought out with simple portraiture; the ivy, the jewels, the creeping plants, and the moonlight being calmly studied or remembered from the things themselves. But of all these special ways in which the invention works with plain facts, we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> farther afterwards.|$|E
60|$|Hereafter {{we shall}} be {{compelled}} {{to acknowledge that the}} only distinction between species and well-marked varieties is, that the latter are known, or believed to be connected at the present day by intermediate gradations, whereas species were formerly thus connected. Hence, without rejecting the consideration of the present existence of intermediate gradations between any two forms, {{we shall be}} led to weigh more carefully and to value higher the actual amount of difference between them. It is quite possible that forms now generally acknowledged to be merely varieties may hereafter be thought worthy of specific names; and in this case scientific and common language will come into accordance. In short, we shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> species {{in the same manner as}} those naturalists treat genera, who admit that genera are merely artificial combinations made for convenience. This may not be a cheering prospect; but we shall at least be freed from the vain search for the undiscovered and undiscoverable essence of the term species.|$|E
6000|$|... 165. Now, {{these are}} the first terms of all well-constructed bas-relief. The mass you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> {{consists}} {{of a piece of}} stone which, however you afterwards carve it, can but, at its most projecting point, reach the level of the external plane surface out of which it was mapped, and defined by a depression round it; that depression being at first a mere trench, then a moat of a certain width, of which the outer sloping bank is in contact, as a limiting geometrical line, with the laterally salient portions of sculpture. This, I repeat, is the primal construction of good bas-relief, implying, first, perfect protection to its surface from any transverse blow, and a geometrically limited space to be occupied by the design, into which it shall pleasantly (and as you shall ultimately see, ingeniously,) contract itself: implying, secondly, a determined depth of projection, which it shall rarely reach, and never exceed: and implying, finally, the production of the whole piece with the least possible labor of chisel and loss of stone.|$|E

60|$|It {{is hardly}} {{necessary}} {{to insist on}} the certainty that our present imperfect knowledge of the limitations and conditions of hereditary transmission will be steadily added to; but I would call attention again to the serious want of adequate materials for study {{in the form of}} life-histories. It is fortunately the case that many of the rising medical practitioners of the foremost rank are become strongly impressed with the necessity of possessing them, not only for the better knowledge of the theory of disease, but for the personal advantage of their patients, whom they now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> less appropriately than they otherwise would, through ignorance of their hereditary tendencies and of their illnesses in past years, the medical details of which are rarely remembered by the patient, even if he ever knew them. With the help of so powerful a personal motive for keeping life-histories, and of so influential a body as the medical profession to advocate its being done,[21] and to show how to do it, there is considerable hope that the want of materials to which I have alluded will gradually be supplied.|$|E
6000|$|By way of an {{antidote}} or febrifuge, I am {{going on at}} a great rate with my HISTORY OF THE STEVENSONS, which I hope may prove rather amusing, in some parts at least. The excess of materials weighs upon me. My grandfather is a delightful comedy part; and I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat</b> him besides as a serious and (in his way) a heroic figure, and at times I lose my way, and I fear in the end will blur the effect. However, A LA GRACE DE DIEU! I'll make a spoon or spoil a horn. You see, I {{have to do the}} Building of the Bell Rock by cutting down and packing my grandsire's book, which I rather hope I have done, but do not know. And it makes a huge chunk of a very different style and quality between Chapters II. and IV. And it can't be helped! It is just a delightful and exasperating necessity. You know, the stuff is really excellent narrative: [...] only, perhaps there's too much of it! There is the rub. Well, well, it will be plain to you that my mind is affected; it might be with less. THE EBB TIDE and NORTHERN LIGHTS are a full meal for any plain man.|$|E
60|$|In truth, the new {{philosophy}} deserves {{neither the}} praise of its eulogists, nor the blame of its slanderers. As I have pointed out, its disciples were guided by no search after practical fruits, {{during the great}} period of its growth, and it reached adolescence without being stimulated by any rewards of that nature. The bare enumeration {{of the names of}} the men who were the great lights of science {{in the latter part of}} the eighteenth and the first decade of the nineteenth century, of Herschel, of Laplace, of Young, of Fresnel, of Oersted, of Cavendish, of Lavoisier, of Davy, of Lamarck, of Cuvier, of Jussieu, of Decandolle, of Werner and of Hutton, suffices to indicate the strength of physical science in the age immediately preceding that of which I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>treat.</b> But of which of these great men can it be said that their labors were directed to practical ends? I do not call to mind even an invention of practical utility which we owe to any of them, except the safety lamp of Davy. Werner certainly paid attention to mining, and I have not forgotten James Watt. But, though some of the most important of the improvements by which Watt converted the steam-engine, invented long before his time, into the obedient slave of man, were suggested and guided by his acquaintance with scientific principles, his skill as a practical mechanician, and the efficiency of Bolton's workmen had quite as much to do with the realisation of his projects.|$|E
