5|$|Although the sawmills and {{the flour}} mills are long gone, Minneapolis remains a {{regional}} center in banking and industry. The two largest milling companies, General Mills and the Pillsbury Company, now merged under the General Mills name, still remain prominent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities area.

5|$|The highway {{was first}} {{designated}} along {{a series of}} roads between Appleton and Minneapolis around 1933. At first these roads were a mixture of gravel and bitumen surfaces, the latter a forerunner of today's asphalt. Within the first year or so, the western end was extended to terminate MN7 in the Ortonville area. In 1958, the highway was extended to its modern western terminus at Beardsley by replacing another trunk highway. The section that is now an expressway <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities was expanded by the 1950s, and the whole highway was paved in a hard-surface {{by the end of}} that decade. The highway was truncated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities to its current eastern terminus in the 1980s. The scenic byways designations were applied at the state and federal levels in 1995 and 2002, respectively.|$|E

In many instances, openings were cut in the floors to accommodate new stairways to connect tenant floors. Some steel beams in the core were reinforced and strengthened to accommodate heavy live loads, such as large amounts of heavy files that tenants had on their floors.|$|E
5|$|Saint Paul hosts {{a number}} of professional, semi-professional, and amateur sports teams.

5|$|Born in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1927, Dworsky lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities and Sioux Falls, South Dakota before {{attending}} the University of Michigan. Dworsky was a four-year starter for Fritz Crisler's Michigan Wolverines football teams from 1945 to 1948. He played linebacker, fullback, and {{center for the}} Michigan Wolverines and was a key player on the undefeated 1947 and 1948 Michigan football teams that won consecutive national championships. The 1947 team, anchored by Len Ford, Alvin Wistert, Dworsky and Rick Kempthorn, {{has been described as}} {{the best team in the}} history of Michigan football. Dworsky won a total of six varsity letters at Michigan, four in football and two in wrestling where he competed in the heavyweight division.

5|$|Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils {{have been}} found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Mountains Formation of {{northern}} Texas, the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma, and the Cloverly Formation of north-central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida. These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically, but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age. Based on changes in ammonite taxa, {{the boundary between the}} Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas, which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation. This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage, which lasted from 125 to 112million years ago. The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus, two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation, which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages, suggesting a similar age for the Antlers. Therefore, Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Zach left New Jersey to {{sign with}} the Minnesota Wild on July 4. In an {{interview}} with media from both NJ and Minnesota, he simply states 'I want to enjoy the lakes and my time here". After becoming an unrestricted free agent, Parise signed a 13-year contract worth $98 million with the Minnesota Wild. The move represented a homecoming for Parise, who grew up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> cities of Minneapolis–Saint Paul and whose father J. P. Parisé once captained the Minnesota North Stars. Parise joined fellow free agent signee Ryan Suter in signing with the Wild; Suter signed on terms identical to Parise's deal. Parise would wear number 11 with the Wild, the same number that his father J. P. wore with the North Stars, as number 9 was already taken by team captain Mikko Koivu. Both Parise and Suter were named alternate captains for the Wild on July 10.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} two decades there would be two Persian invasions of Greece, {{including}} some of the most famous battles in history. During the first invasion, Thrace, Macedon and the Aegean islands were added to the Persian Empire, and Eretria was duly destroyed. However, the invasion ended in 490 BC with the decisive Athenian victory at the Battle of Marathon. Between the two invasions, Darius died, and responsibility for the war passed to his son Xerxes I. Xerxes then led the second invasion personally in 480 BC, taking an enormous (although oft-exaggerated) army and navy to Greece. Those Greeks who chose to resist (the 'Allies') were defeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>twin</b> battles of Thermopylae and Artemisium on land and at sea respectively. All of Greece except the Peloponnesus thus fell into Persian hands, but then seeking to finally destroy the Allied navy, the Persians suffered a decisive defeat at the Battle of Salamis. The following year, 479 BC, the Allies assembled the largest Greek army yet seen and defeated the Persian invasion force at the Battle of Plataea, ending the invasion and the threat to Greece.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by real-life Christmas toy sell-outs for {{products}} such as the Cabbage Patch Kids and Mighty Morphin Power Rangers, the film was written by Randy Kornfield. Producer Chris Columbus rewrote the script, adding in elements of satire about the commercialization of Christmas, and the project {{was picked up by}} 20th Century Fox. Delays on Fox's reboot of Planet of the Apes allowed Schwarzenegger to come on board the film, while Columbus opted to cast Sinbad ahead of Joe Pesci as Myron. Jingle All the Way was set and filmed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Twin</b> Cities of Minneapolis and Saint Paul at a variety of locations, including the Mall of America. After five weeks filming, production moved to California where scenes such as the end parade were shot. The film's swift production meant merchandising was limited to a replica of the Turbo-Man action figure used in the film.|$|E

5|$|Maloney cast John Franklyn-Robbins as the Time Lord {{because he}} had worked with him before and {{intended}} his character to resemble Death in The Seventh Seal.

Peter Miles previously played Dr. Lawrence in Doctor Who and the Silurians (1970) and Professor Whitaker in Invasion of the Dinosaurs (1974). Stephen Yardley, who played the Muto Sevrin, later appeared in Vengeance on Varos (1985). During filming of Genesis, Yardley walked into the casting department on his lunch break in costume and asked for a job; because of his costume, they assumed he was a tramp from the street.

The Crucified, Tutu and the Pirates and Silver Abuse were among the city's first punk bands. In Boston, the scene at the Rat was joined by the Nervous Eaters, Thrills, and Human Sexual Response. In Washington, D.C., the Controls played their first gig in spring 1977, but the city's second wave really broke the following year with acts such as the Urban Verbs, Half Japanese, D'Chumps, Rudements and Shirkers.
