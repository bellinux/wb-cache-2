5|$|The primary {{authority}} {{on the design of}} the film was concept artist Albert <b>Hurter.</b> All designs used in the film, from characters' appearances to the look of the rocks in the background, had to meet Hurter's approval before being finalized. Two other concept artists— Ferdinand Hovarth and Gustaf Tenggren— also contributed to the visual style of Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. Hovarth developed a number of dark concepts for the film, although many other designs he developed were ultimately rejected by the Disney team as less easily translated into animation than Hurter's. Tenggren was used as a color stylist and to determine the staging and atmosphere of many of the scenes in the film, as his style borrowed from the likes of Arthur Rackham and John Bauer and thus possessed the European illustration quality that Walt Disney sought. He also designed the posters for the film and illustrated the press book. However, Hovarth didn't receive a credit for the film. Other artists to work on the film included Joe Grant, whose most significant contribution was the design for the Queen's Witch form.|$|E

25|$|The {{octagonal}} font is {{made from}} local sandstone. It has been dated to around 1280. It was placed on a circular plinth during the 1894–95 restoration. The altar {{is made from}} wood taken from the rood screen which was taken down at the Reformation. The screen under the tower arch dates from the 17thcentury. A pew behind the pulpit is dated 1607. In the church are seven hatchments {{on the walls of}} the nave relating to the Bold family, dating from 1762 to 1840. The lectern and pulpit date from the 1894–95 restoration. The stained glass in the north aisle dated 1876 was made by Morris & Co. and depicts the scene of the fiery furnace in the book of Daniel. The glass in the east window is by Burlison and Grylls, dated 1891, and that in the west window and in the east window in the transept are by Shrigley and Hunt. In the chancel are memorials to John and Edward Atherton who died respectively in 1826 and 1820 showing a sarcophagus in relief which is by T.Franceys and Spence of Liverpool. On the south wall is a pink marble tablet to the memory of the scientist Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> who died in 1898.|$|E
500|$|The Queen's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} the [...] "ageless ice goddess" [...] character of Queen Ayesha ("She who must be obeyed") from the 1935 film She, played by Helen Gahagan. The Queen, who was originally to be named Grimhilde (but who is never actually named in the film), was also modeled in part on Princess Kriemhild in the 1924 film Die Nibelungen. It is also possible that the Queen's looks may have been inspired by the faces of Joan Crawford and Gale Sondergaard; her costume and figure may have been inspired by a column statue at the Naumburg Cathedral depicting Uta von Ballenstedt, the wife of Eckard II, Margrave of Meissen who was widely regarded as the most beautiful woman of Medieval Germany. Also noted was her resemblance to two 1930s American movie stars from Europe, Greta Garbo and Marlene Dietrich. The Queen and Snow White were refined by Grim Natwick and Norm Ferguson, who would often override Walt Disney's instructions. As in the case of other characters for the film, the Queen's appearance had to be approved by Albert <b>Hurter</b> before being finalised. One pre-final version of the queen had her wear a looser hood and a different crown and the edge of her cape was fur trimmed, as it can be seen in Gustaf Tenggren's pictures.|$|E
500|$|On August 9, 1934, twenty-one {{pages of}} notes—entitled [...] "Snowwhite suggestions"—were {{compiled}} by staff writer Richard Creedon, suggesting the principal characters, {{as well as}} situations and 'gags' for the story. As Disney had stated {{at the very beginning}} of the project, the main attraction of the story for him was the Seven Dwarfs, and their possibilities for [...] "screwiness" [...] and [...] "gags"; the three story meetings held in October and attended by Disney, Creedon, Larry Morey, Albert <b>Hurter,</b> Ted Sears and Pinto Colvig were dominated by such subjects. At this point, Disney felt that the story should begin with Snow White's discovery of the Cottage of the Seven Dwarfs. Walt Disney had suggested from the beginning that each of the dwarfs, whose names and personalities are not stated in the original fairy tale, could have individual personalities. The dwarfs names were chosen from a pool of about fifty potentials, including Jumpy, Deafy, Dizzey, Hickey, Wheezy, Baldy, Gabby, Nifty, Sniffy, Swift, Lazy, Puffy, Stuffy, Tubby, Shorty, and Burpy. The seven finalists were chosen through a process of elimination. The leader of the dwarfs, required to be pompous, self-important and bumbling, was named Doc; others were named for their distinguishing character traits. At the end of the October story meetings, however, only Doc, Grumpy, Bashful, Sleepy and Happy of the final seven were named; at this point, Sneezy and Dopey were replaced by 'Jumpy' and an unnamed seventh dwarf.|$|E
50|$|The seven {{species of}} Scaphiopodidae {{are found in}} {{different}} locations across North America. The Eastern Spadefoot is the only species found east of the Mississippi River, ranging from New England to southern Florida. The Great Basin Spadefoot and the Plains Spadefoot are both found in western Canada and the northwestern U.S. but the Plains Spadefoot has also spread into Texas and northern Mexico. The Couch’s Spadefoot, <b>Hurter’s</b> Spadefoot and New Mexico Spadefoot are all spread across the southern and southwestern U.S. with the Couch’s and <b>Hurter’s</b> also reaching into Mexico. The Western Spadefoot is the only species found in California, mainly southern {{parts of the state}} and extending into Mexico as well.|$|R
40|$|Fitzsimons and Shah (2008) {{demonstrate}} that relationships {{are used as}} instruments to further goals, and that helpful others are drawn closer than those harmful others. Other research looks at when goals {{are more likely to}} be pursued (Fujita, Trope, Liberman, & Levin-Sagi, 2006). Abstract thought leads to better goal pursuit than concrete thought. People thinking abstractly should show the pattern found in Fitzsimons and Shah (2008) more than those at the concrete level. One should form relationships more strategically at the abstract level than a person who is thinking concretely. To test this, my study design included a questionnaire of goals and asked for names of Helpers and <b>Hurters</b> of those goals. A task was completed to invoke a tendency for abstract or concrete thought. Participants list a category (abstract) or an exemplar (concrete) for a given word 40 times. Finally, a closeness questionnaire asked participants to rate closeness to the Helpers and <b>Hurters</b> listed previously. Fitzsimons and Shah’s (2008) work was replicated, but level of abstraction did not have an impact on closeness ratings...|$|R
50|$|The Revolution of 1848 {{involved}} {{the loss of}} <b>Hurter's</b> position at Court, to which, however, he was restored in 1852. Till his death he laboured for the spread of Catholic religion, especially in connexion with the foreign mission field; he was also in close touch with the greatest scholars of the day. He was appointed by the pope a commander of the Order of St Gregory, {{and was a member}} of the academies of Rome, Munich, Brussels, and Assisi.|$|R
2500|$|Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> (15 March 1844 [...] 12 March 1898) was a Swiss {{industrial}} chemist {{who settled}} in England. [...] He also carried out research into photography.|$|E
2500|$|In 1871 <b>Hurter</b> married Hannah Garnett of Farnworth, Widnes, {{with whom}} he had six children, one of whom died in infancy. [...] They lived first at Prospect House in Crow Wood and later in Wilmere House, Widnes. [...] <b>Hurter</b> {{remained}} a Swiss citizen throughout his life and sent his children to receive part of their education in Switzerland. [...] He enjoyed music and played the clarinet and piano. [...] He also took an interest in photography, collaborating in research with Vero Charles Driffield, an engineer at the Gaskell-Deacon works. Together they published many papers (in addition to Hurter's papers in chemistry). [...] They were jointly awarded the Progress Medal of the Royal Photographic Society in 1898. The results of their research revolutionised photography. <b>Hurter</b> campaigned for free education and for the introduction of the metric system into Britain. [...] He died at his home in Cressington Park, Liverpool and was buried in the churchyard of Farnworth church. [...] His estate was valued at slightly less than £6,300.|$|E
2500|$|When the Leblanc {{factories}} merged in 1890 to {{form the}} United Alkali Company, <b>Hurter</b> was placed in charge of developing a research laboratory in Widnes. [...] This was later named after him. He {{played a part in}} the foundation of the Society of Chemical Industry in 1881, becoming its chairman in 18881890. He published 24 papers in English journals alone. [...] He gave many lectures to try to popularise scientific subjects. [...] As chief chemist to the United Alkali Company, despite his failing health, he travelled to a number of countries in Europe and also made one visit to the USA. [...] The Society of Chemical Industry endowed the <b>Hurter</b> Memorial Lecture in his name.|$|E
50|$|The American {{green tree frog}} was {{designated}} the official state amphibian of Louisiana in 1993. Examples of other amphibians in Louisiana are salamanders such as the eastern tiger salamander, southern red-backed salamander, Gulf Coast waterdog, dwarf salamander and the three-toed amphiuma. There are also toads such as <b>Hurter's</b> spadefoot toad and southern toad, as well as frogs such as pig frog, striped chorus frog and the bronze frog. American bullfrogs are the largest frogs native to Louisiana.|$|R
5000|$|His first work in {{the sense}} was [...] "De Romani pontificis in temporalibus auctoritate [...] " [...] (3 vols., Valentia, 1691-94).

In this monumental work the author collected and published in alphabetical order, and in their entirety, all the important works dealing with {{the primacy of the}} Holy See from an orthodox point of view, beginning with Abraham Bzovius and ending with Zacharias Boverius. A summary is given in <b>Hurter's</b> Nomenclator.|$|R
50|$|Moody {{returned}} to session work with Mike Oldfield, Gary Glitter, Mike d'Abo and Roger Chapman, {{as well as}} selected T.V music library work. He toured with Chris Farlowe and also worked with former Meal Ticket singer Willy Finlayson and his band the <b>Hurters.</b> Taking a wry, yet witty view {{on some of the}} people and experiences they'd encountered over the years, he got together with Bob Young to write a book on musician's humour, the acclaimed Language of Rock and Roll. He also put together the first version of the Micky Moody Band featuring former Taste bassist Charlie McCracken and drummer Chris Hunt. Towards {{the end of the decade}} he and Bernie Marsden played selected venues with their own Moody Marsden Band.|$|R

2500|$|Jan [...] "Jacky" [...] Willem <b>Hurter</b> Morkel (13 November 1890 – 15 May 1916) was a South African {{international}} rugby union player, {{who also}} played first class cricket. Morkel played at centre for Somerset West RFC and Western Province. He {{was selected for}} [...] for the 1912–13 tour of the Home Nations and France. He played in 18 games on the tour, including all five test matches, and scored four tries, two of them against [...] His brother, Gerhard, and his cousins 'Boy' and Dougie, were also on the tour. Jacky Morkel also represented Transvaal in cricket.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Hurter</b> {{was offered}} a {{professorship}} in Aarau but declined this and, with a few letters of introduction, arrived in Manchester in 1867. [...] He joined Henry Deacon and Holbrook Gaskell at their alkali manufacturing business, Gaskell, Deacon & Co., in Widnes, Lancashire. [...] Here he became chief chemist and worked with Deacon to develop a process to convert hydrochloric acid, a waste by-product of the Leblanc process of making alkali, to chlorine which was then used to manufacture bleaching powder. [...] He was a pioneer in applying the principles of physical chemistry and thermodynamics to industrial processes and by 1880 {{was considered to be}} a world authority on the manufacture of alkali. [...] He was a strong defender of the Leblanc process against the other methods of manufacturing alkali being developed at the time although he did research the ammonia-soda process but without any success. He argued against the production of alkali by the electrolysis of brine because of the enormous amount of electrical power this would require although he was later to have second thoughts.|$|E
40|$|We {{conducted}} {{a study of the}} amphibian, reptile, and small mammal community assemblage of Ozark pocket gopher (Geomys bursarius ozarkensis) habitat in north-central Arkansas. We used 2 methods to capture individuals: hand capture and drift fences. During the study, we captured and marked a total of 9 anuran, 4 salamander, 5 lizard, 3 turtle, 16 snake, and 8 small mammal species exclusive of pocket gophers. We found one hatchling three-toed box turtle (Terrapene carolina triunguis) and one rough earth snake (Virginia striatula) inside a pocket gopher burrow and mound, respectively. Additionally, we witnessed both eastern racers (Coluber constrictor) and eastern coachwhips (Masticophis flagellum) retreat into pocket gopher burrows, as well as <b>Hurter’s</b> spadefoots (Scaphiopus holbrookii hurterii) burrow into pocket gopher mounds when released. Our results highlight the importance of mammalian burrows, specifically pocket gophers, to other vertebrate associates in grassland ecosystems. Both conservationists and managers need to determine the pocket gopher’s impact on ecosystem health and viability, specifically in natural grasslands, before conservation and/or management strategies are employed...|$|R
60|$|I blush {{to confess}} it, but I invited Mr. Paraday {{that very day}} to {{transcribe}} into the album {{one of his most}} characteristic passages. I told him how I had got rid of the strange girl who had brought it—her ominous name was Miss <b>Hurter</b> and she lived at an hotel; quite agreeing with him moreover as to the wisdom of getting rid with equal promptitude of the book itself. This was why I carried it to Albemarle Street no later than on the morrow. I failed to find her at home, but she wrote to me and I went again; she wanted so much to hear more about Neil Paraday. I returned repeatedly, I may briefly declare, to supply her with this information. She had been immensely taken, the more she thought of it, with that idea of mine about the act of homage: it had ended by filling her with a generous rapture. She positively desired to do something sublime for him, though indeed I could see that, as this particular flight was difficult, she appreciated the fact that my visits kept her up. I had it on my conscience to keep her up: I neglected nothing that would contribute to it, and her conception of our cherished author’s independence became at last as fine as his very own. “Read him, read him—that will be an education in decency,” I constantly repeated; while, seeking him in his works even as God in nature, she represented herself as convinced that, according to my assurance, this was the system that had, as she expressed it, weaned her. We read him together when I could find time, and the generous creature’s sacrifice was fed by our communion. There were twenty selfish women about whom I told her and who stirred her to a beautiful rage. Immediately after my first visit her sister, Mrs. Milsom, came over from Paris, and the two ladies began to present, as they called it, their letters. I thanked our stars that none had been presented to Mr. Paraday. They received invitations and dined out, and some of these occasions enabled Fanny <b>Hurter</b> to perform, for consistency’s sake, touching feats of submission. Nothing indeed would now have induced her even to look at the object of her admiration. Once, hearing his name announced at a party, she instantly left the room by another door and then straightway quitted the house. At another time when I was at the opera with them—Mrs. Milsom had invited me to their box—I attempted to point Mr. Paraday out to her in the stalls. On this she asked her sister to change places with her and, while that lady devoured the great man through a powerful glass, presented, {{all the rest of the}} evening, her inspired back to the house. To torment her tenderly I pressed the glass upon her, telling her how wonderfully near it brought our friend’s handsome head. By way of answer she simply looked at me in charged silence, letting me see that tears had gathered in her eyes. These tears, I may remark, produced an effect on me of which the end is not yet. There was a moment when I felt it my duty to mention them to Neil Paraday, but I was deterred by the reflexion that there were questions more relevant to his happiness.|$|E

50|$|In 1888, Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> and Vero Charles Driffield {{patented}} {{a device}} for estimating the actinic power of sunlight and for computing exposure times and apertures for cameras, {{based on the}} plate speed, time of day, time of year, and latitude. These were slide rules, not measuring instruments, and did not produce a graph, but <b>Hurter</b> and Driffield adopted the same name for it.|$|E
50|$|Another early {{practical}} system {{for measuring the}} sensitivity of an emulsion was that of <b>Hurter</b> and Driffield (H&D), originally described in 1890, by the Swiss-born Ferdinand <b>Hurter</b> (1844-1898) and British Vero Charles Driffield (1848-1915). In their system, speed numbers were inversely proportional to the exposure required. For example, an emulsion rated at 250 H&D would require ten times the exposure of an emulsion rated at 2500 H&D.|$|E
