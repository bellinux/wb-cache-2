Kansas virus eluted from DEAE columns showed one peak of hemagglutinating and infective particles. Two peaks of hemagglutinins and one peak of infective particles were observed when the NK strain was chromatographed, {{indicating that the}} stock virus contained a noninfectious hemagglutinating component. Treatment of the noninfectious particles with <b>Genetron</b> 113 resulted {{in an increase in}} the ratio of infective to hemagglutinating particles. The Genetron-treated noninfectious particles were also eluted from the DEAE column at a higher salt concentration than the untreated noninfectious particles.

40|$|Yaba {{poxvirus}} virions were extracted and purified from Rhesus monkey tumors. A saline-soluble virion fraction (Y-xp), {{obtained by}} mechanical fractionation of purified virions with an X-press, contained seven components in acrylamide gel electrophoresis; {{five of these}} components were reactive in immunodiffusion with whole virion and Y-xp antisera produced in rabbits and monkeys. The saline-insoluble residue remaining after X-press treatment was hydrolyzed with sodium dodecyl sulfate, urea, and 2 -mercaptoethanol (SUM). This fraction, Y-sum, contained five components, four of which were demonstrable by immunodiffusion. There {{was no evidence of}} antigenic relationships between Y-xp and Y-sum antigens in immunodiffusion. In acrylamide gel electrophoresis, one Y-xp and one Y-sum component had similar mobilities. Y-xp but not Y-sum antisera contained viral-neutralizing antibodies. Virus-free saline extracts of Yaba tumor prepared with <b>Genetron</b> (YS) were essentially devoid of virion structural antigens. They failed to induce precipitating antibodies for virion antigens, were nonreactive in immunodiffusion with virion antisera, and gave low complement-fixation titers with virion antisera. Yaba virion antigens were recovered from the <b>Genetron</b> tumor sediment by SUM and alkaline hydrolysis. Antisera prepared to YS extracts gave a maximum of 17 precipitin lines in immunodiffusion with YS extracts; none was identified as a virion structural antigen. Saline extracts of tumor prepared without <b>Genetron</b> contained immunogenic amounts of 5 virion antigens and 12 to 14 associated antigens. Animals immunized with infected cell culture extracts (virus-free) formed antibodies to six to seven virion antigens. The implications of using extracts of Yaba poxvirus-infected tissues in complement-fixation tests to measure virion antibodies were discussed...|$|E

40|$|The antigens of Trichomonas vaginal {{is grown}} jn Diamond 1 s medium {{modified}} by Klass {{were analyzed by}} gel diffusion methods. Three methods were employed in the extraction of the antigens. They were <b>Genetron</b> extract, Borate Buffer Saline extract, and alcohol extract. The alcohol extract {{was made up of}} four fractions (TF 1, TF 2, TF 3, TF 4). The antisera used as analytic agents were made in two rabbits obtained from the Center for Disease Control Breeding Colony. All the antigens were compared to show bands of identity, non-identity, and partial identity, and to determine the number of bands produced by each extract. <b>Genetron</b> extract antigen and Borate Buffer Saline extract antigen reacted strongly with the homologous antiserum made in rabbit 3 (R 3), producing 4 bands each, while alcohol extract reacted minimally. Fractions TF 1 and TF 4 produced 3 bands each and fraction TFz and TF 3 produced 2 bands each Two bands of precipitate were found to be common to all the antigens, suggesting the similarity of the antigens. In rabbit 4 (R 4), 3 bands were produced by each antigen and they were all identical, confirming the similarity of the antigens. Rabbit 3 antiserum reacted more strongly than rabbit 4, even though all the rabbits were inoculated on the same dates with the same number of live Trichomonas vaginalis antigens under the same conditions...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{serological}} {{studies have}} indicated that the group antigen of chlamydial organisms is composed of an acidic polysaccharide and a lipid component. The present study was undertaken in an effort to locate this polysaccharide complex by use of electron microscopy and a silver-methenamine marker. The meningopneumonitis strain of Chlamydia psittaci was propagated in HeLa-M cell culture. Organisms were purified by differential centrifugation, treatment with <b>Genetron,</b> and by gel filtration. After fixation and embedding, sections were obtained for electron microscopy. Sections were stained for carbohydrates with silver-methenamine. A double layer of regularly spaced silver grains of uniform size was observed at the periphery of the sectioned organisms tracing the contours of the surface membrane (cell wall). This intensity of staining was observed only when sections were oxidized with periodate prior to silver-methenamine staining. Prior treatment with 1 % sodium deoxycholate resulted in a significant reduction in staining. It is considered probable that the periodate-sensitive polysaccharide found at the periphery of the organisms represents, or is a component of, the group antigen of these organisms...|$|E
40|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on a virus which has recently been implicated as an etiological agent in widely disseminated cases of calf diarrhea. The virus was isolated from feces and intestinal mucosa from experimentally infected calves and from cell cultures which had been inoculated with material from infected calves. The virus was purified by differential centrifugation, nuclease treatment, extraction with <b>Genetron</b> 113 and cesium chloride (CsC 1) gradient. Purified and non-purified samples were studied by electron microscopy. Both types of preparations contained unenveloped particles approximately 64 nm in diameter with a hexagonal core region 36 nm in diameter. Subunits of the capsids appeared to be arranged in accordance with cubic synmetry. Essential lipids were not associated with the virus. The buoyant density of purified virus was 1. 359. Viral nucleic acid was determined by chemical methods to be ribonucleic acid (RNA). The morphology and some chemical characteristics appear {{to be similar to}} those of the reovirus group.

ReF 5 This is decomposed to ReF 6 by three further moles of XeF 2. The use of proportions intermediate between these gives only mixtures of Re 2 (CO) 10 and Re(CO) 5 F. ReF 5, or Re(CO) 5 F. ReF 5 and ReF 6. When HF is used as the solvent, a similar process is indicated, but partial hydrolysis of HF solutions of HF solutions of Re(CO) 5 F. ReF 5 frequently occurred, to give (Re(CO) 6) + (ReOF 5) -. No conclusive evidence for Re(CO) 5 F was found. Re 2 (CO) 10 also forms Re(CO) 5 F. ReF 5 with two moles of ReF 6, in HF solution, but with four moles, the new, ionic 1 : 2 complex (Re (CO) 6) + (Re 2 F 11) - is produced. Re (CO) 5 F. TaF 5 and (Re(CO) 6) +(Sb 2 F 11) - were produced by exchange reactions of Re(CO) 5 F. ReF 5 with TaF 5 and SbF 5 respectively. The oxidation of [(n 5 -C 5 H 5) Fe (CO) 2] 2 with AgF in acetone produced 5 evidence for a new fluoride, (n 5 -C 5 H 5) Fe(CO) 2 F. It was surmised that the maintenance of stable (Re(CO) 5 F) or (Re(CO) 6) + units governs the course of these fluorinations, and that, in general, carbonyl fluorides will only exist with certain, specific, stable units. Analogous units were proposed for other carbonyl fluoride systems, and a general progression for metal carbonyl fluorinations was established, through simple carbonyl fluoride to carbonyl fluoride-pentafluoride complex(es), and finally binary fluoride. The carbonyl fluoride-pentafluoride complex plays {{a fundamental role in}} these systems which has no parallel in other organometallic halides, although related complexes are known in a few cases. Full X-ray crystal structures of Re(CO) 5 F. ReF 5 and ?-(Re (CO) 6) + (Re 2 F 11) - were performed, and a partial investigation made of (Re (CO) 6) + (ReOF 5) -. Re (CO) 5 F. ReF 5 is an essentially covalent, fluorine-bridged complex whose bond lengths are of value for comparing other fluorine-bridged interactions. Polymorphism is found in (Re(CO) 6) +(Re 2 F 11) -.
