40|$|With {{a view to}} {{developing}} simulation criteria for the laboratory testing of high-temperature materials for gas turbine engines, the deposition rates of sodium sulfate from sodium salt-seeded combustion gases were determined experimentally using a well instrumented <b>high-velocity</b> <b>burner.</b> In the experiments, Na 2 SO 4, NaCl, NaNO 3, and simulated sea salt solutions were injected into the combustor of the Mach 0. 3 burner rig operating at constant fuel/air ratios. The deposits formed on an inert rotating collector were then weighed and analyzed. The experimental results are compared to Rosner's vapor diffusion theory. Some additional test results, including droplet size distribution of an atomized salt spray, are used in interpreting the deposition rate data...|$|E
40|$|Review of 1000 to 1200 C cyclic {{oxidation}} testing {{conducted on}} potential aircraft gas turbine Ni-, Co-, and Fe-base alloys. Furnace and burner rig testing are discussed, {{and the results}} are compared for selected alloys. The alloys fall into two groups, depending on their Cr and Al contents. One group forms mainly Cr 2 O 3 /chromite spinel scale(s), while the other forms alpha Al 2 O 3 /aluminate spinel scale(s). Spalling on thermal cycling leading to increased metal consumption is associated with the appearance of a chromite spinel. In the case of <b>high-velocity</b> <b>burner</b> rig tests this chromite forming tendency is reinforced by Cr 2 O 3 vaporization depleting Cr in the alloy. In both types of tests, specific weight change is used as an indirect indicator of metal attack, since direct metal loss measurements require destructive analysis. An alternative nondestructive metal loss estimating parameter, based on a tentative mass balance gravimetric approach, shows some potential...|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} commercially {{available}} SiC and Si 3 N 4 materials {{were exposed to}} 1000 C for 40 h in a <b>high-velocity,</b> pressurized <b>burner</b> rig as a simulation of an aircraft turbine environment. Na impurities (2 ppm) added to the burner flame resulted in molten Na 2 SO 4 deposition, attack of the SiC and Si 3 N 4, and formation of substantial Na 2 O+x(SiO 2) corrosion product. Room-temperature strength of the materials decreased {{as a result of}} the formation of corrosion pits in SiC and grain-boundary dissolution and pitting in Si 3 N 4...|$|R
40|$|The Hot Corrosion Test Facility (HCTF) at the NASA Lewis Special Projects Laboratory (SPL) is a <b>high-velocity,</b> {{pressurized}} <b>burner</b> rig {{currently used}} to evaluate the environmental durability of advanced ceramic materials such as SiC and Si 3 N 4. The HCTF uses laboratory service air which is preheated, mixed with jet fuel, and ignited to simulate the conditions of a gas turbine engine. Air, fuel, and water systems are computer-controlled to maintain test conditions which include maximum air flows of 250 kg/hr (550 lbm/hr), pressures of 100 - 600 kPa (1 - 6 atm), and gas temperatures exceeding 1500 C (2732 F). The HCTF provides a relatively inexpensive, yet sophisticated means for researchers to study the high-temperature oxidation of advanced materials, and the injection of a salt solution provides the added capability of conducting hot corrosion studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of a recently formulated vapor transport theory to predict deposition rates of corrosive salts from alkali-seeded combustion gases of a small-capacity, <b>high-velocity,</b> atmospheric-pressure <b>burner</b> rig was hampered by the relatively large dimensions of the cylindrical deposit collector compared to {{the diameter of the}} combustion gas stream. The relative dimensions lead to a highly nonadiabatic combustion gas flow around the collector and necessitate two series of experiments. In the first series, mass transfer coefficients are determined by utilizing the naphthalene sublimation technique. The second series of experiments determines the dilution effect on the sodium species concentrations due to the entrainment of ambient air. This second series involves the measurement of the temperature variation along the surface of the collector under steady state conditions. Vapor deposition rates are determined exploiting this information and the results are found to compare favorably with experimentally obtained rates...|$|R
