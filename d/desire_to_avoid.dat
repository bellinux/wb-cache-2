5|$|After the {{practice}} of lynching was suppressed in central Texas, it received little attention from local historians. However, Waco developed a reputation for racism—propagated in part by American history textbooks—to the vexation of the city's white residents. In the years following the lynching, African Americans often held Waco in disdain, and some viewed the 1953 Waco tornado outbreak as divine retribution. White leaders of Waco took a non-violent approach in response to demonstrations during the Civil Rights Movement, possibly owing to a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> stigmatizing the city again.|$|E
5|$|In early 1971, Rainbow played {{its first}} show, which {{consisted}} of two sets performed at Richmond Community College in Staten Island. After the show, the group discovered that there was already another band called Rainbow. They decided to drop the name, {{and came up with}} the name Wicked Lester, which Klein liked because it was unusual. While the decision to change the group's name came partly out of a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> any potential legal issues, it also reflected Klein and Eisen's desire to start playing more original compositions.|$|E

5|$|Rumours {{about his}} father's cowardice during the First Crusade, however, {{continued}} to circulate, and a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the same reputation {{may have influenced}} some of Stephen's rasher military actions. His wife, Matilda, {{played a major role}} in running their vast English estates, which contributed to the couple being the second-richest lay household in the country after the King. The landless Flemish nobleman William of Ypres had joined Stephen's household in 1133.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{obtained a}} land patent from the London Virginia Company in June 1619. They had declined {{the opportunity to}} settle south of Cape Cod in New Netherland because of their <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the Dutch influence. This land patent allowed them to settle {{at the mouth of}} the Hudson River. They sought to finance their venture through the Merchant Adventurers, a group of businessmen who principally viewed the colony as a means of making a profit. Upon arriving in America, the Pilgrims began working to repay their debts.|$|E
5|$|After {{serving in}} office for an extra year to 1905, Clarke retired, having helped to create a better system {{for the benefit of}} all. While the Colonial Office sought to mediate {{conflicts}} of interest, its impact was varied due to its <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> expense. Milner was preoccupied with his vision of a new South Africa incorporating Southern Rhodesia, for which he needed the support of the BSAC. He appears to have had respect for Clarke, although he seems to have resented his influence at the Colonial Office, denying him an increase in salary or an official secretary. On Clarke's retirement, Milner wrote 'Personally I hardly think the office of Resident Commissioner any longer necessary'.|$|E

5|$|After the war, Haynes Stellite {{moved to}} {{producing}} tableware, jewelry, and pocket knives. The {{employees of the}} company unionized and began to demand wage increases beyond what Haynes believed was fair. The threat of labor strikes and Haynes' <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> the problem led him to sell the company to Union Carbide on April 10, 1920, in exchange for 25,000 shares of Union Carbide stock valued at $2million. He later made an additional half million from dividends. Other details of the deal were never made public, and Haynes may have made as much $4million on the sale. After a series of owners, the company is now called Haynes International and is again independent.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E

On 25 November, General Savary {{was sent to the}} Allied {{headquarters}} at Olmutz to deliver Napoleon's message expressing his <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a battle, while secretly examining the Allied forces' situation. As expected, the overture was seen as a sign of weakness. When Francis I offered an armistice on the 27th, Napoleon accepted enthusiastically. On the same day, Napoleon ordered Soult to abandon both Austerlitz and the Pratzen Heights and, while doing so, to create an impression of chaos during the retreat that would induce the enemy to occupy the Heights.|$|E

5|$|Amid this {{environment}} of intense internal pressure {{for the band}} to break through to widespread popularity, the band relocated to Marietta, Georgia in late 1992 to begin work on their second album, with Butch Vig returning as producer. The decision to record {{so far away from}} their hometown was motivated partly by the band's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> friends and distractions during the recording, but largely as a desperate attempt to cut Chamberlin off from his known drug connections. The recording environment for Siamese Dream was quickly marred by discord within the band. As was the case with Gish, Corgan and Vig decided that Corgan should play nearly all of the guitar and bass parts on the album, contributing to an air of resentment. The contemporary music press began to portray Corgan as a tyrant. Corgan's depression, meanwhile, had deepened {{to the point where he}} contemplated suicide, and he compensated by practically living in the studio. Meanwhile, Chamberlin quickly managed to find new connections and was often absent without any contact for days at a time. In all, it took over four months to complete the record, with the budget exceeding $250,000.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1911 federal election, {{several local}} Liberals opposed to Frank Oliver asked Rutherford {{to run against}} him in Strathcona. Relations between Oliver and Rutherford had always been chilly—Oliver was implacably opposed to Cross, who he viewed as a rival for {{dominance}} of the Liberal party in Alberta, and his Edmonton Bulletin had taken {{the side of the}} dissidents during the railway scandal. A nominating meeting unanimously nominated Rutherford as Liberal candidate, though Oliver refused to accept its legitimacy and awaited a later meeting. Before this meeting came to pass, however, Rutherford abruptly withdrew. Historian Douglas Babcock suggested that this was due to the Conservatives' nomination of William Antrobus Griesbach, dashing Rutherford's hopes that his popularity among Conservatives would preclude their opposing him. Rumours at the time alleged that Rutherford had been asked to make a personal contribution of $15,000 to his campaign fund, and had balked. Rutherford himself cited a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> splitting the vote on reciprocity, which he and Oliver both favoured but Griesbach opposed. Whatever the reason, for Rutherford's standing aloof from the election, Oliver was nominated as Liberal candidate and was re-elected.|$|E
5|$|Al-Ma'mun {{had made}} no {{official}} provisions for his succession. His son, al-Abbas, was old enough and had acquired experience in the border wars with the Byzantines, but had not been named heir. According to the account in al-Tabari, on his deathbed, al-Ma'mun dictated a letter nominating his brother, rather than al-Abbas, as his successor, and Abu Ishaq was acclaimed as Caliph on 9 August, {{with the name of}} al-Mu'tasim. It is impossible to know whether this reflects actual events, or whether the letter was an invention and Abu Ishaq merely took advantage of his proximity to his dying brother, and al-Abbas's absence elsewhere, to propel himself to the throne. As Abu Ishaq was the forefather of all subsequent Abbasid caliphs, historians had little desire to question the legitimacy of his accession, {{but it is clear that}} his position was far from secure: a large part of the army favoured al-Abbas, and a delegation of soldiers even went to him and tried to proclaim him as the new Caliph. Only when al-Abbas himself refused, whether out of weakness or out of a <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a civil war, and himself took the oath of allegiance to his uncle, did the soldiers acquiesce to al-Mu'tasim's succession. The precariousness of his position is further evidenced by the fact that al-Mu'tasim immediately called off the expedition, abandoned the Tyana project and returned with his army to Baghdad, which he reached on 20 September.|$|E

5|$|He {{expressed}} {{surprise that}} a task {{as important as}} the expedition's was entrusted to such young men. Von Hentig had to convince the Emir that the mission did not consider themselves merchants, but instead brought word from the Kaiser, the Ottoman Sultan, and from India, wishing to recognise Afghanistan's complete independence and sovereignty. The Kaiser's typewritten letter, which he compared to the handsome greeting received from the Ottomans, failed to settle the Emir's suspicions; he doubted its authenticity. Von Hentig's explanation that the Kaiser had written the letter using the only instrument available at his field headquarters before the group's hurried departure may not have entirely convinced him. Passing along the Kaiser's invitation to join the war {{on the side of the}} Central Powers, von Hentig described the war situation as favourable and invited the Emir to declare independence. This was followed by a presentation from Kasim Bey explaining the Ottoman Sultan's declaration of jihad and Turkey's <b>desire</b> <b>to</b> <b>avoid</b> a fratricidal war between Islamic peoples. He passed along a message to Afghanistan similar to the Kaiser's. Barkatullah invited Habibullah to declare war against the British Empire and to come to the aid of India's Muslims. He proposed that the Emir should allow Turco-German forces to cross Afghanistan for a campaign towards the Indian frontier, a campaign which he hoped the Emir would join. Barkatullah and Mahendra Pratap, both eloquent speakers, pointed out the rich territorial gains the Emir stood to acquire by joining the Central Powers.|$|E
