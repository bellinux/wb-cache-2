5|$|Bartlett's initial {{plan had}} been for the group to rest briefly on Wrangel Island and then to move on {{together}} to the Siberian coast. However, because three men—Mamen, Malloch and Maurer—were injured, and others were weak and frostbitten, Bartlett decided that the main party should remain on the island while he went for help taking only Kataktovik. The pair started off on 18 March, with seven dogs and provisions for 48 days (30 days for the dogs), and took an extended route round the island's southern shores to look for signs of Anderson's or Mackay's parties. After finding nothing, they headed across the ice towards Siberia, but progress was slow over a surface that was frequently shifting and breaking up to form leads of open water. More time was lost digging out their provisions from the steadily <b>drifting</b> <b>snow.</b> As they drew nearer to the mainland, Kataktovik became nervous; he had heard that the Alaskan Inuit were disliked in Siberia by the native Chukchi people, and feared for his life. Bartlett {{did his best to}} reassure him as they moved slowly forward.|$|E
5|$|With Ortona and Villa Grande captured, {{it looked}} as if it would require the Eighth Army only to regather itself and strike one more {{concentrated}} blow at Orsogna to complete the breaching of the Gustav Line's main Adriatic strongpoints. However, on 31 December, as V Corps probed along the coastal plain towards Pescara, a blizzard enveloped the battlefield. <b>Drifting</b> <b>snow,</b> sleet and biting winds paralysed movement and communications on the ground while cloud ceiling and visibility fell to nil and grounded the airforce. Montgomery—realising the Eighth Army no longer had the strength or conditions to force its way to Pescara and the Via Valeria to Rome—recommended to General Alexander that the Eighth Army offensive should be halted. Alexander agreed but ordered him to maintain aggressive patrolling in order to pin the units of the LXXVI Panzer Corps in the Adriatic sector and prevent Kesselring moving them to reinforce the XIV Panzer Corps front opposite Lieutenant General Mark W. Clark's U.S. Fifth Army where the Allied offensive would continue.|$|E
25|$|Snowfall is {{variable}} {{from year}} to year, but the area gets much more snow on average than {{other parts of the}} country.

40|$|Atmospheric {{numerical}} simulation and dynamic retrieval method with atmospheric numerical analyses {{are used to}} assess the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic precipitation for the last two decades. First, the Polar MM 5 has been run over Antarctica to study the Antarctic precipitation. With a horizontal resolution of 60 km, the Polar MM 5 has been run for the period of July 1996 through June 1999 in a series of short-term forecasts from initial and boundary conditions provided by the ECMWF operational analyses. In comparison with climatological maps, the major features of the spatial distribution of Antarctic precipitation are well captured by the Polar MM 5. <b>Drift</b> <b>snow</b> effects on redistribution of surface accumulation over Antarctica are also assessed with surface wind fields from Polar MM 5 in this study. There are complex divergence and convergence patterns of <b>drift</b> <b>snow</b> transport over Antarctica, especially along the coast. It is found that areas with large <b>drift</b> <b>snow</b> transport convergence and divergence are located around escarpment areas where there is large katabatic wind acceleration.

25|$|The Winter Line {{proved a}} major {{obstacle}} to the Allies {{at the end of}} 1943, halting the Fifth Army's advance on the western side of Italy. Although the Gustav Line was penetrated on the Eighth Army's Adriatic front, and Ortona captured, blizzards, <b>drifting</b> <b>snow</b> and zero visibility at the end of December caused the advance to grind to a halt. The Allies' focus then turned to the western front, where an attack through the Liri valley was considered to have the best chance of a breakthrough towards the Italian capital. Landings at Anzio during Operation Shingle, advocated by the British Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, behind the line were intended to destabilise the German Gustav line defences, but the early thrust inland to cut off the German defences did not occur, thanks to the indecisiveness of the American commander (Major General John P. Lucas), and the Anzio forces became bottled up in their beachhead. Lucas was replaced by Major General Lucian Truscott.|$|E
25|$|As {{in western}} New York, the storm struck {{suddenly}} {{during the day}} Friday, with zero visibility, and blowing and <b>drifting</b> <b>snow</b> making roads impassable, and stranding many vehicles. Looting of radios from abandoned cars, as well as looting of soda pop from a truck was reported. Friday night, 250people were stranded in the International Nickel Company plant in Port Colborne. Although schools closed when informed of the impending storm, the rapid onset of the storm resulted in about 1,000 students being stranded overnight, January 28, in Port Colborne and Wainfleet schools (about 2,000 students were stranded in the Niagara region altogether). By Saturday, January 29, night at 6 p.m., 800 students were still trapped, with 600 of them in Wainfleet and Port Colborne. On Sunday, the remaining students {{were taken from the}} schools {{with the help of the}} militia; some students were housed in nearby houses.

40|$|Surface snow {{accumulation}} is {{the primary}} mass input to the Antarctic ice sheets. As the dominant term among various components of surface snow accumulation (precipitation, sublimation/deposition, and <b>snow</b> <b>drift),</b> pre-cipitation is of particular importance in helping to assess the mass balance of the Antarctic ice sheets and their contribution to global sea level change. The Polar MM 5, a mesoscale atmospheric model based on the fifth-generation Pennsylvania State University– NCAR Mesoscale Model, has been run {{for the period of}} July 1996 through June 1999 to evaluate the spatial and temporal variability of Antarctic precipitation. <b>Drift</b> <b>snow</b> effects on the redistribution of surface snow over Antarctica are also assessed with surface wind fields from Polar MM 5 in this study. It is found that areas with large <b>drift</b> <b>snow</b> transport convergence and divergence are located around escarpment areas where there is considerable katabatic wind acceleration. It is also found that the <b>drift</b> <b>snow</b> transport generally diverges over most areas of East and West Antarctica with relatively small values. The use of the dynamic retrieval method (DRM) to calculate precipitation has been developed and verified for the Greenland ice sheet. The DRM is also applied to retrieve the precipitation over Antarctica from 1979 to 1999 in this study.

500|$|Alberta {{clippers}} are fast-moving {{areas of}} low pressure that move through Minnesota {{during the winter}} months.

[...] (Other variations of {{the same type of}} storm systems are [...] "Saskatchewan Screamers" [...] or [...] "Manitoba Maulers".) [...] Although clippers often originate over the northern Pacific Ocean, they lose most of their moisture through orographic lift when they collide with the Canadian Rockies. [...] Because of the limited moisture content and quick movement of the systems, clippers rarely produce more than 6in (15cm) of snow as they pass through Minnesota. [...] The biggest effects of an Alberta Clipper are what follows them, and that is arctic air, high wind speed, and dangerous wind chills. [...] This often results in severe blowing and <b>drifting</b> <b>snow,</b> and sometimes even blizzard conditions. Alberta Clippers often proceed to become copious lake-effect snow producers on the southern and eastern shores of the Great Lakes.|$|E

40|$|In 1979,the {{measurement}} of the surface temperature was made at Mizuho Station (70 ° 42 ′S, 44 ° 20 ′E, and 2230 m above sea level), East Antarctica, by employing three different methods, a platinum resistance thermometer, a pyrgeometer and a radiation thermometer. These instruments were installed at different sites, on the <b>drift</b> <b>snow,</b> on the sastrugi and on the glazed surface. In winter the surface temperature measured by these different methods is roughly similar, but in spring and summer the surface temperature depends upon the density of snow and the wind speed. Namely, the surface temperature on the glazed surface (multi-year eroded surface with density {{twice as large as}} that of the surface of <b>drift</b> <b>snow</b> and sastrugi) is different from that on the surface of <b>drift</b> <b>snow</b> and sastrugi. Mizuho Station is located in the katabatic wind area where the various forms of snow surface coexist.
