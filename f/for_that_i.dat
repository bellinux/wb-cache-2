25|$|I owe {{so much to}} Brett, and teamTBB. It was Brett that {{advised me}} to turn pro, {{he told me to}} do an Ironman and he trained me to win two World Ironman Championships. Not only that, the Team {{framework}} enabled me to train with some of the best athletes in the world; to grow and develop as a person and to learn some incredibly important lessons. With the Team I reached heights that I never thought possible, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am truly grateful. teamTBB is focused on helping 'development athletes' who might otherwise not have the opportunity to succeed in professional triathlon. I no longer fit into their framework, and hence {{the time has come for}} me to move on.|$|E
25|$|But {{perhaps my}} finest memory of this lordly Frenchman came in 1966 at the Nürburgring, where a German {{official}} had been particularly rude {{to myself and}} other English journalists about going through one gate (the exit) to the press room instead of another 100 yards away (the entrance). We sat in delight, Sid Saltmarsh, Bill Long and me, not 20 yards from that 'Exit' gate, and watched as Jacques pulled up in his Ford Mustang, and proceeded to unload his bike {{from the back of}} the car. Yes, he did, not leaving it to mechanics. German official railed and cried, but all in vain. The seigniorial aspect came out oh so clearly, and Jacques did not merely ignore him, it was palpably as if the German did not exist at all. He left the car there, walked over to the riders' quarters pushing the gate open and the German with it. It has probably the finest comeuppance I shall ever see, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall remember Jacques for a long time.|$|E
500|$|... {{may have}} been arbitrary, self-willed and even unfair, but he 'called 'em as he saw 'em' and he turned over to his {{successor}} and the future a game cleansed of the nasty spots which followed World War I. Kenesaw Mountain Landis put the fear of God into weak characters who might otherwise have been inclined to violate their trust. And <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I,</b> as a lifelong lover of baseball, am eternally grateful.|$|E

5000|$|Police found a hand-painted ISIL flag at his foster family's home, {{along with}} a letter he {{appeared}} to have written to his father, which they said read: [...] "And now pray <b>for</b> me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> can get revenge on these non-believers, pray <b>for</b> me <b>that</b> <b>I</b> go to heaven." ...|$|R
500|$|Jones {{announced}} on 8 April 2008 on Blue Peter that after three and half {{years with the}} show, he would be leaving {{at the end of}} the current series in June. His spokeswoman said he had always planned to leave when he turned 30. Jones said, [...] "I've had a career on Blue Peter that you wouldn't even dream about and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> feel privileged and fortunate. ... I've loved it, lived it ... and now I feel the time is right to leave it." ...|$|E
500|$|Of her character's changes after season five, Kirshner stated: [...] "I think she'll {{continue}} {{to be just like}} a tumbleweed and a car crash and I'm happy <b>for</b> <b>that,</b> <b>I</b> don't want it to be wrapped up. She'll never be normal and that's just the way it is." [...] Responding to the criticism Jenny has received, Kirshner states: [...] "Well, I agree with what's said about the character for the most part. But again... it's my job. So, I mean, it's a fun character." ...|$|E
500|$|If Bell Nicholls {{was a poor}} unknown curate in England – in Banagher he was {{a member}} of a respectable family. In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: [...] "My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep {{pleasure}} in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have got one of the best gentlemen in the country .... I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Father of {{gods and}} men,' said the majestic mother of Proserpine, 'listen to a distracted parent! All my hopes were centred in my {{daughter}}, {{the daughter of}} whom you have deprived me. <b>Is</b> it <b>for</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> endured the pangs of childbirth? <b>Is</b> it <b>for</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> suckled her on this miserable bosom? <b>Is</b> it <b>for</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> tended her girlish innocence, watched with vigilant fondness the development of her youthful mind, and cultured with a thousand graces and accomplishments her gifted and unrivalled promise? to lose her for ever!' ...|$|R
5000|$|Everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> {{have worked}} <b>for,</b> {{everything}} <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have hoped <b>for,</b> everything <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have believed in during my public life has crashed into ruins.

500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by film director George Lucas, Lewis Hamilton expressed gratitude to his {{team and the}} fans at the venue. Felipe Massa, asked about his last lap fight with teammate Bottas, stated: [...] "I’m getting old <b>for</b> <b>that!</b> <b>I</b> even said to the team I’m getting old! The last three laps of the race I was fighting with my team-mate. It was very difficult but we managed to be here." [...] During the post-race press conference, Hamilton expressed surprise over his championship lead, since {{he had not been}} made aware of Rosberg's retirement at that point. When asked about the tyre pressure issue, Sebastian Vettel defended Hamilton, saying: [...] "I think it’s not fair to hand that question to Lewis because he doesn’t know what’s going on [...] In a lot of respect and fairness he {{did a very good job}} today and you have to accept that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between both clubs had become strained, {{not least because}} of Chelsea's financial advantage; the club was owned by billionaire Roman Abramovich. The day after Chelsea announced losses of £80million for 2005–06, Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger expressed concern over his opponent's conduct: [...] "I have said many times that all the clubs should be balanced with their natural resources. That means they can only spend what they earn." [...] Chelsea manager José Mourinho refused to respond to Wenger's comments in his UEFA Champions League pre-match press conference, but made reference to his record in the competition in contrast to his counterpart: [...] "Many great managers {{in the world have}} never won it. The big example is not far from us; Arsène Wenger is a top manager in the world. He's a big manager in the world of football and he never did it so when I did it once, I can thank God <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> have that." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1895, Krøyer {{wrote to}} his friend Oscar Björck: [...] "I am also {{thinking}} of painting a large portrait of {{my wife and me}} together — but <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> shall definitely need good weather, so it won't be this year." [...] In fact it was four years later, in the summer of 1899, that he finally created the large painting Summer Evening at Skagen Beach – The Artist and his Wife. The result nevertheless has a rather melancholic tone. Despite the beautiful surroundings, Marie appears distant, disappearing into the blue moonlight. Even Krøyer's own weak figure seems to be experiencing difficulty in supporting her on his arm while the closest figure of all is Rap the dog. The painting again presents the blue half-light. Krøyer particularly appreciated [...] "l'heure bleue": [...] "Skagen can look so terribly dull in the bright sunlight ... but when the sun goes down, when the moon rises up out of the sea ... in recent years this has been the time I like most of all." ...|$|E

"Aye, lawyer, I {{remember}} {{this and other}} things. <b>For</b> instance, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have the safe-conduct of the Empress under an oath sworn on the Cross of the Christ she worships. <b>For</b> instance, also, <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have three hundred comrades waiting my safe return." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{is little}} fear of that," [...] he said. [...] "The papers are {{of no use}} except to us and to England. To England, <b>I</b> will admit <b>that</b> the foreknowledge of what is to come would be worth much, {{although}} the eventful result would be the same. It is <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason <b>that</b> <b>I</b> am here, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> reason <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have made you this offer." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{is it for}} this," [...] Elise cried, burying {{her face}} in her handkerchief--"is it <b>for</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have loved you passionately for upwards of ten months? <b>Is</b> it <b>for</b> this <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have braved my mother's wrath? Oh, you have broken my heart; I am sure you have!" [...] and she sobbed hysterically.|$|R
500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... I {{would go to the}} furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice what is best for me to do, <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E
500|$|Odelay was {{released}} on June 18, 1996, to commercial success and critical acclaim. The record produced several hit singles, including [...] "Where It's At", [...] "Devils Haircut", and [...] "The New Pollution", and was nominated for the Grammy Award for Album of the Year in 1997, winning a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album {{as well as a}} Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance for [...] "Where It's At". During one busy week in January 1997, he landed his Grammy nominations, appeared on Saturday Night Live and Howard Stern, and did a last-minute trot on The Rosie O'Donnell Show. The combined buzz gave Odelay a second wind, leading to an expanded fan base and additional exposure. Beck enjoyed but, like several executives at Geffen, was bewildered by the success of Odelay. He would often get recognized in public, which made him feel strange. [...] "It's just weird. It doesn't feel right. It doesn't feel natural to me. I don't think I was made <b>for</b> <b>that.</b> <b>I</b> was never good at that," [...] he later told Pitchfork. Odelay sold two million copies and put [...] "one-hit wonder" [...] criticisms to rest. During this time, he contributed the song [...] "Deadweight" [...] to the soundtrack of the film A Life Less Ordinary (1997).|$|E
500|$|Washington Post {{journalist}} Erik Wemple {{criticized the}} story's graphic {{details of the}} alleged crime and {{said that it was}} hard to believe due to the [...] "diabolical" [...] description. A number of commentators accused the magazine of setting rape victims [...] "back decades", while The Washington Post described the Rolling Stone story as a [...] "catastrophe for journalism". Natasha Vargas-Cooper, a columnist at The Intercept, said that Erdely's decision not to interview the accused fraternity members showed [...] "a horrendous, hidden bias ... the premise that none of these guys would tell the truth if asked", while a staff editorial in The Wall Street Journal charged that [...] "Ms. Erdely did not construct a story based on facts, but went looking for facts to fit her theory." [...] Lauren Kling of the Poynter Institute criticized Rolling Stone for [...] "blaming [...] source" [...] instead of taking ownership of their own errors. Anna Merlan, a writer for Jezebel, who had earlier called Reason columnist Robby Soave an [...] "idiot" [...] for expressing skepticism of the Rolling Stone story, declared: [...] "I was dead fucking wrong, and <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> sincerely apologize." [...] Merlan had also labeled journalist Richard Bradley's doubts about the article a [...] "giant ball of shit".|$|E

500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks <b>for</b> <b>that!</b> <b>I</b> realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a grubby, greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E
500|$|By 2003, she {{was being}} {{recognised}} around the world from countries like Portugal and Japan. She said of her private life: [...] "I don't really have a private life. I've found it difficult as an athlete, to maintain a relationship. It's not {{one of my best}} points but I've got family and friends who compensate for that. When I was younger I went out and had a lot of fun, and there were moments when people criticised me for that, and you know what, I'm young, I'm going to do that, and anyone who is going to get on me <b>for</b> <b>that</b> ... <b>I</b> really didn't care." [...] She does not like to go clubbing for two reasons: First, she gets recognised by too many people. [...] Second, everyone wants to comment on her height. In response to getting a hug from Yao Ming at the 2008 Summer Olympics during the closing ceremonies, internet rumours started that Jackson and the married Ming were romantically involved. [...] These rumours were incorrect. [...] Jackson said of them: [...] "When we came across this Yao Ming thing it was like, 'Oh...My...God! When I tell you we were in hysterics...because anybody who knows me knows that would be the last thing on my mind. A 7 foot 8 Chinese man? That's just not my thing. I really respect him as a player. And people who know me know I can be wild and over-the-top. I'm affectionate and that night I guess I was affectionate with the wrong person. I guess the Chinese people don't do that stuff very often, so the cultural [...] was a big thing. But I don't care. You have to laugh about things or you'll be crying, which I would probably have been doing anyway [...] I made the most of my last night at the Olympics and had a great time." [...] She partied a fair amount in her early 20s. By 2010, she was not able to stay out at night clubs until 5:30am any more because she lacked the stamina.|$|E
2500|$|Jeb Bush– [...] "As I {{understand}} it, [...] didn't {{respond to}} legitimate concerns of acts of racism on campus, {{and may have}} missed an opportunity to try and heal the wounds and give people {{the sense that the}} University had no tolerance <b>for</b> <b>that...</b> <b>I</b> don't know, I haven't followed it that carefully so I can't say if his resignation was appropriate or not." ...|$|E

From the Sword in the Stone to the introduction of Arthur and Lancelot, I think this just might work–and be far more integrated into the series narrative than Frozen had been. And <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> cheer!!" ...|$|E

Foot writes that Buttle was [...] "a very good club bowler, fast by those {{standards}} and able to move the ball away." [...] Buttle himself is quoted as saying: [...] "Harry (Harry Fernie, the groundsman) was always short staffed and but <b>for</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think I'd have got a few games {{on some of the}} northern tours.
