40|$|Abstract. The European Working Time Directive [1] is {{beginning}} to have {{a profound impact on}} the delivery of out-of-hours services in hospitals throughout the UK. Three hospitals in Lanarkshire are pioneering a new approach to hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> called HECT (Hospital <b>Emergency</b> <b>Care</b> <b>Teams).</b> A handheld computer system was developed to support organizational audit and clinical handover within these specialised HECT teams. This study reports on the evaluation of the HECT handheld system in order to establish both how the system was used by the nurses in practice and how well it was accepted within these new HECT teams. Positively rated features include the generation of a printed handover report and the facilitation of clinical audit. Negative outcomes included the potential of additional time required to input data on handheld devices. The results suggest that, if introduced properly, similar PDA based clinical handover systems could successfully be adopted by many other UK hospitals to allow successful health care under these new working time directives. The outcomes from this study could influence both the design of future handheld clinical support systems and the successful integration and evaluation of such systems into the healthcare environment...|$|R

In the context of a multicenter randomized clinical trial offering family members the choice of observing CPR of a patient with sudden cardiac arrest, a qualitative analysis, with a sequential explanatory design, was conducted. The aim {{of the study was to}} understand family members' experience during CPR. All participants were interviewed by phone at home three months after cardiac arrest. Saturation was reached after analysis of 30 interviews of a randomly selected sample of 75 family members included in the trial.

Twelve sub-themes further defining these four themes were identified. Transferability of our findings should take into account the country-specific medical system.

This paper {{makes the point that}} <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> can make an important contribution to reducing avoidable death and disability in low- and middle-income countries. But <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> needs to be planned well and supported at all levels — at the national, provincial and community levels — and take into account the entire spectrum of care, from the occurrence of an acute medical event in the community to the provision of appropriate care at the hospital. The mix of personnel, materials, and health-system infrastructure can be tailored to optimize the provision of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in settings with different levels of resource availability. The misconception that <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> cannot be cost effective in low-income settings is demonstrably inaccurate. Emergencies occur everywhere, and each day they consume resources regardless of whether there are systems capable of achieving good outcomes. With better planning, the ongoing costs of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> can result in better outcomes and better cost-effectiveness. Every country and community can and should provide <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> regardless of their place in the ratings of developmental indices.

40|$|ABSTRACT OBJECTIVE To {{analyze the}} process of {{implementation}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units in Brazil. METHODS We have carried out a documentary analysis, with interviews with twenty-four state urgency coordinators and a panel of experts. We have analyzed issues related to policy background and trajectory, players involved in the implementation, expansion process, advances, limits, and implementation difficulties, and state coordination capacity. We have used the theoretical framework of {{the analysis of the}} strategic conduct of the Giddens theory of structuration. RESULTS <b>Emergency</b> <b>care</b> units have been implemented after 2007, initially in the Southeast region, and 446 <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units were present in all Brazilian regions in 2016. Currently, 620 <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units are under construction, which indicates expectation of expansion. Federal funding was a strong driver for the implementation. The states have planned their <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units, but the existence of direct negotiation between municipalities and the Union has contributed with the significant number of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units that have been built but that do not work. In relation to the urgency network, there is tension with the hospital {{because of the lack of}} beds in the country, which generates hospitalizations in the <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> unit. The management of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units is predominantly municipal, and most of the <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> units are located outside the capitals and classified as Size III. The main challenges identified were: under-funding and difficulty in recruiting physicians. CONCLUSIONS The <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> unit has the merit of having technological resources and being architecturally differentiated, but it will only succeed within an urgency network. Federal induction has generated contradictory responses, since not all states consider the <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> unit a priority.

40|$|International {{emergency}} medicine aims to understand different systems of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> across the globe. To date, however, international {{emergency medicine}} lacks common descriptors that can encompass {{the wide variety}} of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> systems in different countries. The frequent use of general, system-wide indicators (e. g. the status of emergency medicine as a medical specialty or the presence of emergency medicine training programs) does not account for the diverse methods that contribute to the delivery of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> both within and between countries. Such indicators suggest that a uniform approach to the development and structure of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> is both feasible and desirable. One solution to this complex problem is to shift the focus of international studies away from system-wide characteristics of <b>emergency</b> <b>care.</b> We propose such an alternative methodology, in which studies would examine emergency department-specific characteristics to inventory the various methods by which <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> is delivered. Such characteristics include: emergency department location, layout, time period open to patients, and patient type served. There are many more ways to describe emergency departments, but these characteristics are particularly suited to describe with common terms a wide range of sites. When combined, these four characteristics give a concise but detailed picture of how <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> is delivered at a specific emergency department. This approach embraces the diversity of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> as well as the variety of individual emergency departments that deliver it, while still allowing for the aggregation of broad similarities that might help characterize a system of <b>emergency</b> <b>care...</b>|$|R

Schools must provide nursing services to children who attend school, but ratios of registered nurses to students is higher than the 1 : 750 recommended ratio. Current school teachers believe pre-service teachers should be trained in <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in teacher training programs. Yet, no research has been conducted to evaluate pre-service teachers’ knowledge and attitudes toward <b>emergency</b> <b>care.</b> The purpose of the study was to investigate pre-service teachers’ knowledge of and attitude toward <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in the school setting. A cross sectional group-comparison survey design was used. A 40 -item questionnaire was administered to pre-service elementary teachers at Ball State University located in Muncie, IN. The questionnaire consisted of questions from “Emergencies in the school setting: Are public school teachers adequately trained to respond?” and Urban public school teachers’ attitudes and perceptions of the effectiveness of CPR and automated external defibrillators. Sub-group comparisons were made using bivariate and multivariate analyses of similar demographic, attitude, and knowledge questions. Findings indicated that pre-service teachers have a positive attitude toward <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> low levels of knowledge about <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> and a low level of willingness to provide <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in schools.

However, neither country has an integrated <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> system that provides community access to high-quality emergency services. There has been recent interest in strengthening the <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> systems in these countries, but before any interventions are implemented, an assessment of the current need for <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> must be conducted, as the burden of acute disease and barriers to accessing <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in Zambia and Kenya remain largely undocumented. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this project was to ascertain community-based perceptions of the critical interventions necessary to improve access to <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in Zambia and Kenya, with the following objectives: 1. Determine the current pattern of out-of-hospital <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> delivery at the community level. 2. Identify the communitiesâ€™ experiences with emergency conditions and the barriers they face when trying to access care. 3. Discover community-generated solutions to the paucity of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in urban and rural settings. Methods: Semi-structured focus groups were piloted in Zambia with 200 participants. Results were analysed with subsequent tool refinement for Kenya. Data were collected via focus groups with 600 urban and rural community members in cities and rural villages in the 8 Kenyan provinces. Thematic analysis of community member focus groups identified frequency of emergencies, perceptions of <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> perceived barriers to <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> and ideas for potential interventions. Results: Analysis of the focus group data identified several common themes. Community members in Zambia and Kenya experience a wide range of medical emergencies, and they rely on family members, neighbours, and Good Samaritans for assistance. These community members frequently provide assistance with transportation to medical facilities, and also attempt some basic first aid. These communities are already assisting one another during emergencies, and are willing to help in the future. Participants in this study also identified several barriers to <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> : a lack of community education, absent or non-functional communication systems, insufficient transportation, no triage system, a lack of healthcare providers trained in <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> and inadequate equipment and supplies. Conclusions: Community members in Zambia and Kenya experience a wide range of medical emergencies.

40|$|In sub-Saharan Africa, {{the shift}} in disease burden from infections to non-communicable disease and injury {{highlights}} the need for effective and efficient <b>emergency</b> <b>care.</b> Despite this, <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> is a neglected sector of the health system in most low and middle-income countries. Funding and resource allocations are often small and have little impact {{on the development of}} <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> systems, and provision of <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> is therefore frequently left to under-trained and/or under-prepared nurses or clinical officers. In order to develop effective <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> systems, one must first identify strengths and challenges in existing systems. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine facility-based <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> capacity in public hospitals in Zambia. This descriptive cross-sectional study comprised of a total of 23 facilities: seven districts, 12 general and four central hospitals. Data were collected using a standardised <b>Emergency</b> <b>Care</b> Assessment Tool (ECAT); developed in 2013 by AFEM to ascertain facilities' strengths and weaknesses in the delivery of the <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> services for five sentinel conditions and maternal health. The ECAT was administered through one-on-one interviews with designated personnel working in emergency receiving areas. The assessment tool consists of six main themes relating to the ability to provide care for patients suffering from respiratory failure, shock, altered mental status, severe pain, trauma and maternal health. The majority of facilities were able to perform almost all the procedures across all themes. However, some procedures, which were highly technical and required personnel with specialist training or specialised equipment, were not performed at all facilities. The level of the facility also dictated whether a procedure could be performed where higher-level health facilities like central hospitals were able to perform more procedures than lower-level facilities due to higher numbers of trained personnel, more equipment and supplies, and better infrastructure. Maternal health was covered in almost all (> 90 %) hospitals. Across all themes, the most frequent reasons for not performing procedures were lack of supplies (n= 137) followed by no training (n= 136), no infrastructure (n= 35) and no human resources (n= 34). At the central level, the most frequent reason for not performing procedures was no supplies (n= 16), whereas at district and general levels the most frequent reason was no training. Overall, most facilities were able to offer basic <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> services. However, there is limited capacity of training and supplies across all facilities, as well as a lack of infrastructure and policies for <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> in lower-level facilities. Zambian hospitals can provide basic <b>emergency</b> <b>care,</b> but there is need to enhance training and improve on provision of supplies to enable facilities to provide <b>emergency</b> <b>care.</b> Focus must also be on development of policies relating to <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> to guide and standardise procedures. Capacity building should be more focused at district and general hospitals to improve <b>emergency</b> <b>care</b> across all levels of health facilities, as it will reduce the burden at central level and improve patient outcomes since these are first-line access points for patients...|$|R
