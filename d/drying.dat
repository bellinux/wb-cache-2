5|$|Most of the gyromitrin must {{be removed}} to render false morels edible. The {{recommended}} procedure involves either first <b>drying</b> and then boiling the mushrooms, or boiling the fresh mushrooms directly. To prepare fresh mushroom {{it is recommended that}} they are cut into small pieces and parboiled twice in copious amounts of water, at least three parts water to one part chopped mushrooms, for at least five minutes, after each boiling the mushroom should be rinsed thoroughly in clean water. Each round of parboiling reduces the gyromitrin contents to a tenth. The gyromitrin is leached into the water where it will remain, therefore the parboiling water must be discarded and replaced with fresh water after each round of boiling. <b>Drying</b> the mushrooms can also reduce the concentration of gyromitrin; ten days of open air desiccation leads to the loss of 90% of gyromitrin. However it is still recommended that the mushroom be boiled after <b>drying.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{nutrient}} or {{mineral content}} of foods, animal feeds or plant tissues are often expressed on a <b>dry</b> matter basis, i.e. as {{a proportion of}} the total <b>dry</b> matter in the material.

The potassium content is 0.72% on a <b>dry</b> matter basis, i.e. 0.72% of the <b>dry</b> matter is potassium. The apple, therefore, contains 158 mg potassium (0.72/100 X 22 g). <b>Dried</b> apple contains the same concentration of potassium on a <b>dry</b> matter basis (0.72%), but is only 32% water (68% <b>dry</b> matter).
