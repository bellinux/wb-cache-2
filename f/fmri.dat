5|$|With {{technological}} {{advances in the}} late 20th century, neurolinguists have also incorporated non-invasive techniques such as {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>fMRI)</b> and electrophysiology to study language processing in individuals without impairments.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to PET and <b>fMRI,</b> which show which {{areas of the}} brain are activated by certain tasks, researchers also use diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), which shows the neural pathways that connect different brain areas, thus providing insight into how different areas interact. Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is another hemodynamic method used in language tasks.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the human}} brain {{represents}} only 2% of the body weight, it receives 15% of the cardiac output, 20% of total body oxygen consumption, and 25% of total body glucose utilization. The brain mostly uses glucose for energy, and deprivation of glucose, as can happen in hypoglycemia, can result in loss of consciousness. The energy consumption of the brain does not vary greatly over time, but active regions of the cortex consume somewhat more energy than inactive regions: this fact forms {{the basis for the}} functional brain imaging methods PET and <b>fMRI.</b> These functional imaging techniques provide a three-dimensional image of metabolic activity.|$|E
5|$|Approach-avoidance {{conflict}} {{happens when}} a situation is presented that can either be rewarding or punishing, and the ensuing decision-making {{has been associated with}} anxiety. <b>fMRI</b> findings from studies in approach-avoidance decision-making found evidence for a functional role that is not explained by either long-term memory or spatial cognition. Overall findings showed that the anterior hippocampus is sensitive to conflict, and that it may be part of a larger cortical and subcortical network seen to be important in decision making in uncertain conditions.|$|E
5|$|Goofus and Gallant strips {{have been}} used for {{research}} purposes. A 2006 study gauging the development of ideas of respect and disrespect among American children used strips from the comic as stimuli to which the subjects could provide qualitative responses regarding why they believed Goofus's or Gallant's actions were respectful or disrespectful. A 2012 study used the strips to prompt autistic and allistic children to identify whether the depicted child (either Goofus or Gallant) was behaving badly while researchers used an <b>fMRI</b> to measure the neural networks used in reaching their conclusions.|$|E
5|$|Many {{language}} studies, {{particularly in}} <b>fMRI,</b> use the subtraction paradigm, in which brain activation in a task thought to involve {{some aspect of}} language processing is compared against activation in a baseline task thought to involve similar non-linguistic processes but not to involve the linguistic process. For example, activations while participants read words may be compared to baseline activations while participants read strings of random letters (in attempt to isolate activation related to lexical processingthe processing of real words), or activations while participants read syntactically complex sentences may be compared to baseline activations while participants read simpler sentences.|$|E
5|$|UM built a brain imaging annex to the James M. Cox Jr. Science Center {{within the}} College of Arts and Sciences. The {{building}} includes a human functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>fMRI)</b> laboratory, where scientists, clinicians, and engineers can study fundamental aspects of brain function. Construction of the lab was funded in part by a $14.8million in stimulus money grant from the National Institute of Health.|$|E
25|$|The <b>fMRI</b> {{technique}} can complement or supplement {{other techniques}} {{because of its}} unique strengths and gaps. It can noninvasively record brain signals without risks of ionising radiation inherent in other scanning methods, such as CT or PET scans. It can also record signal from all regions of the brain, unlike EEG/MEG, which are biased toward the cortical surface. But <b>fMRI</b> temporal resolution is poorer than that of EEG since the HDR takes tens of seconds to climb to its peak. Combining EEG with <b>fMRI</b> is hence potentially powerful because the two have complementary strengths—EEG has high temporal resolution, and <b>fMRI</b> high spatial resolution. But simultaneous acquisition needs {{to account for the}} EEG signal from varying blood flow triggered by the <b>fMRI</b> gradient field, and the EEG signal from the static field. For details, see EEG vs <b>fMRI.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some {{scholars}} have criticized <b>fMRI</b> studies for problematic statistical analyses, {{often based on}} low-power, small-sample studies. Other <b>fMRI</b> researchers have defended their work as valid.|$|E
25|$|Sensory aphasia {{cannot be}} {{diagnosed}} {{through the use}} of imaging techniques. Differences in cognition between asymptomatic subjects and affected patients can be observed via functional magnetic resonance imaging (<b>fMRI).</b> However, these results only reveal temporal differences in cognition between control and diagnosed subjects. The degree of progression during therapy can also be surveyed through cognition tests monitored by <b>fMRI.</b> Many patients’ progress is assessed over time via repeated testing and corresponding cerebral imaging by <b>fMRI.</b>|$|E
25|$|It {{is common}} to combine <b>fMRI</b> signal {{acquisition}} with tracking of participants' responses and reaction times. Physiological measures such heart rate, breathing, skin conductance (rate of sweating), and eye movements are sometimes captured simultaneously with <b>fMRI.</b> The method can also be combined with other brain-imaging techniques such as transcranial stimulation, direct cortical stimulation and, especially, EEG. The <b>fMRI</b> procedure can also be combined with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) to have supplementary information about both oxyhemoglobin and deoxyhemoglobin.|$|E
25|$|Magnetoencephalography (MEG) and {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>fMRI)</b> have both been used successfully as non-invasive BCIs. In a widely reported experiment, <b>fMRI</b> allowed two users being scanned to play Pong in real-time by altering their haemodynamic response or brain blood flow through biofeedback techniques.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{limitations}} when using <b>fMRI</b> or PET to study emotional responses. Because <b>fMRI</b> measures changes in blood oxygenation, using the BOLD effect, its temporal resolution {{is limited by}} the haemodynamic response to several seconds. PET has similar limits, offering slightly better temporal resolution and slightly worse spatial resolution.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} factors and more, <b>fMRI</b> {{evidence}} has been excluded from any form of legal system. The testing is too uncontrolled and unpredictable. Therefore, it has been stated that <b>fMRI</b> has much more testing to do {{before it can be}} considered viable in the eyes the legal system.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (<b>fMRI)</b> {{is a form of}} MRI that is most frequently used {{to take advantage of a}} difference in magnetism between oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin to assess blood flow to different parts of the brain. Typical sampling rates for <b>fMRI</b> images are in the tenths of seconds.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>fMRI</b> studies {{validated}} {{the technique}} against brain activity known, from other techniques, to be correlated to tasks. By the early 2000s, <b>fMRI</b> studies began to discover novel correlations. Still their technical disadvantages have spurred researchers to try more advanced {{ways to increase}} the power of both clinical and research studies.|$|E
25|$|EEG {{sensors can be}} used in {{more places}} than <b>fMRI,</b> SPECT, PET, MRS, or MEG, as these {{techniques}} require bulky and immobile equipment. For example, MEG requires equipment consisting of liquid helium-cooled detectors that can be used only in magnetically shielded rooms, altogether costing upwards of several million dollars; and <b>fMRI</b> requires the use of a 1-ton magnet in, again, a shielded room.|$|E
25|$|In a block design, {{two or more}} {{conditions}} are alternated in blocks. Each block will have a duration of {{a certain number of}} <b>fMRI</b> scans and within each block only one condition is presented. By making the conditions differ in only the cognitive process of interest, the <b>fMRI</b> signal that differentiates the conditions should represent this cognitive process of interest. This is known as the subtraction paradigm.|$|E

25|$|This {{approach}} has been proposed {{as an alternative to}} the BOLD <b>fMRI</b> technique and used to detect visual response to photic stimulation, motor activation by finger tapping and activations in language areas during speech processing. Recently functional real-time single-voxel proton spectroscopy (fSVPS) has been proposed as a technique for real-time neurofeedback studies in magnetic fields of 7 tesla (7 T) and above. This approach could have potential advantages over BOLD <b>fMRI</b> and is the subject of current research.|$|E
25|$|Resting state <b>fMRI</b> has {{identified}} the insular cortex and corticolimbic circuitry as likely brain areas {{responsible for the}} symptomology of anorexia nervosa.|$|E
25|$|With between 72% and 90% {{accuracy}} where chance {{would achieve}} 0.8%, <b>fMRI</b> techniques can decide which {{of a set}} of known images the subject is viewing.|$|E
25|$|The {{separation}} between object individuation and identification in the neural object-file theory {{is supported by}} evidence such as that from Xu's & Chun's <b>fMRI</b> study (as cited in Xu & Chun, 2009). In this study, they examined posterior brain mechanisms that supported visual short-term memory (VSTM). The <b>fMRI</b> showed that representations in the inferior IPS were fixed to roughly four objects regardless of object complexity, but representations in the superior IPS and lateral occipital complex (LOC) varied according to complexity.|$|E
25|$|Alternative {{methods of}} {{scanning}} include x-ray computed tomography (CT), {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (<b>fMRI),</b> ultrasound and single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT).|$|E
25|$|A recent <b>fMRI</b> {{study has}} shown that a placebo can reduce pain-related neural {{activity}} in the spinal cord, indicating that placebo effects can extend beyond the brain.|$|E
25|$|According to <b>fMRI</b> {{studies of}} the brain and {{behavioral}} observations, visual attention can be moved independently of moving eye position. Studies have had participants fixate their eyes on a central point and measured brain activity as stimuli were presented outside the visual fixation point. <b>fMRI</b> findings show changes in brain activity correlated with the shift in spatial attention to the various stimuli. Behavioral studies have also shown that when a person knows where a stimulus is likely to appear, their attention can shift to it more rapidly and process it better.|$|E
25|$|Functional {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (<b>fMRI)</b> has found abnormal activation in the right frontal operculum (RFO), which is an area associated with time-estimation tasks, occasionally incorporated in complex speech.|$|E
25|$|The study Neural Activity Predicts Attitude Change in Cognitive Dissonance (2009) {{identified}} the neural bases of cognitive dissonance with functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); the neural scans of the participants replicated the basic findings of the induced-compliance paradigm. When in the <b>fMRI</b> scanner, some of the study participants argued that the uncomfortable, mechanical environment of the MRI machine nevertheless was a pleasant experience for them; some participants, from an experimental group, said they enjoyed the mechanical environment of the <b>fMRI</b> scanner more than did the control-group participants (paid actors) who argued about the uncomfortable experimental environment.|$|E
25|$|Event-related designs {{allow more}} real world testing, however, the {{statistical}} power of event related designs is inherently low, because the signal {{change in the}} BOLD <b>fMRI</b> signal following a single stimulus presentation is small.|$|E
25|$|Use of the <b>fMRI</b> {{has been}} left out of legal debates {{throughout}} its history. Use of this technology has not been allowed due to holes in the evidence supporting <b>fMRI.</b> First, most evidence supporting fMRIs accuracy was done in a lab under controlled circumstances with solid facts. This type of testing does not pertain to real life. Real-life scenarios can be much more complicated with many other affecting factors. It has been shown that many other factors affect BOLD other than a typical lie. There have been tests done showing that drug use alters blood flow in the brain, which drastically affects the outcome of BOLD testing. Furthermore, individuals with diseases or disorders such as schizophrenia or compulsive lying can lead to abnormal results as well. Lastly, there is an ethical question relating to <b>fMRI</b> scanning. This testing of BOLD has led to controversy over if fMRIs are an invasion of privacy. Being able to scan and interpret what people are thinking may be thought of as immoral and the controversy still continues.|$|E
25|$|Although <b>fMRI</b> {{studies of}} {{schizophrenic}} and bipolar patients have yielded {{some insight into}} the changes in effective connectivity caused by these diseases, a comprehensive understanding of the functional remodelling that occurs has not yet been achieved.|$|E
25|$|If the {{baseline}} condition {{is too close}} to maximum activation, certain processes may not be represented appropriately. Another limitation on experimental design is head motion, which can lead to artificial intensity changes of the <b>fMRI</b> signal.|$|E
25|$|Low spatial {{resolution}} on the scalp. <b>fMRI,</b> for example, can directly display {{areas of the}} brain that are active, while EEG requires intense interpretation just to hypothesize what areas are activated by a particular response.|$|E
25|$|For example, a PET or <b>fMRI</b> scan of {{a person}} who claims they hear voices may show {{activation}} in the primary auditory cortex, or parts of the brain involved in the perception and understanding of speech.|$|E
25|$|The {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (<b>fMRI)</b> machine uses the signal from deoxyhemoglobin, which is sensitive to magnetic fields since it is paramagnetic. Combined measurement with NIRS shows good correlation with both the oxy- and deoxyhemoglobin signal compared to the BOLD signal.|$|E
25|$|Dictionary {{learning}} {{is used to}} analyse medical signals in detail. Such medical signals include those from electroencephalography (EEG), electrocardiography (ECG), magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), fuctional MRI (<b>fMRI),</b> and ultrasound computer tomography (USCT), where different assumptions are used to analyze each signal.|$|E
