5|$|Unlike unique {{sciences}} such as mathematics, the perspective, activity, or {{discipline of}} design is not {{brought to a}} generally accepted common denominator. The historical beginnings of design are complex {{and the nature of}} design is still the subject of ongoing discussion. In design, there are strong differentiations between theory and practice. The fluid nature of the theory allows the designer to operate without being constrained by a rigid structure. In practice, decisions are often referred to as intuition. In his Classification of Design (1976), Gorb divided design into three different classes. Design management operates in and across all three classes: product (e.g. industrial design, packaging design, service <b>design),</b> <b>information</b> (e.g. graphic design, branding, media design, web design), and environment (e.g. retail design, exhibition design, interior design).|$|E

25|$|The {{calculations}} for a nonspherical primary {{are apparently}} {{orders of magnitude}} harder than for a spherical primary. A spherically symmetric simulation is one-dimensional, while an axially symmetric simulation is two dimensional. Simulations typically divide up each dimension into discrete segments, so a one-dimensional simulation might involve only 100 points, while a similarly accurate two dimensional simulation would require 10,000. This would likely be the reason they would be desirable for a country like the People's Republic of China, which already developed its own nuclear and thermonuclear weapons, especially since {{they were no longer}} conducting nuclear testing which would provide valuable <b>design</b> <b>information.</b>|$|E

40|$|One {{effective}} method of redesign is to replay a previous design plan, and modify the plan wherever necessary and possible, {{in accordance to}} the original design intentions, for newly specified design goals. For such a procedure, <b>design</b> <b>informations,</b> such as the design plan and design rationale, must be recorded {{during the course of}} the design. Unfortunately, such <b>design</b> <b>informations</b> are not usually available in practice. The goal of this thesis proposal is to develop a computer-aided tool for redesign assistance starting without the aforementioned types of <b>design</b> <b>informations.</b> To handle the absence of the required <b>design</b> <b>informations</b> and support the "replay and modify paradigm", the proposal focuses on human's ability to perform reverse engineering. Reverse engineering roughly refers to an activity of inferring the process used in creating a given design, and using the inferred knowledge for design recreation or redesign.

25|$|Modifications {{to produce}} weapon-usable {{material}} {{in a commercial}} facility: The production potential is significant. But no fertile or fissile substances necessary {{for the production of}} weapon-usable materials needs to be present at a civil fusion system at all. If not shielded, a detection of these materials can be done by their characteristic gamma radiation. The underlying redesign could be detected by regular <b>design</b> <b>information</b> verifications. In the (technically more feasible) case of solid breeder blanket modules, it would be necessary for incoming components to be inspected for the presence of fertile material, otherwise plutonium for several weapons could be produced each year.|$|E

2500|$|According to the report, Iran also {{continued}} {{to refuse to}} provide <b>design</b> <b>information</b> or access to verify <b>design</b> <b>information</b> for its IR-40 heavy water research reactor. Iran and the IAEA in February 2003 agreed to modify {{a provision in the}} Subsidiary Arrangement to its safeguards agreement (Code 3.1) to require such access. Iran told the Agency in March 2007 that it [...] "suspended" [...] the implementation of the modified Code 3.1, which had been [...] "accepted in 2003, but not yet ratified by the parliament", and that it would [...] "revert" [...] to the implementation of the 1976 version of Code 3.1. The subsidiary arrangement may only be modified by mutual agreement. Iran says that since the reactor is {{not in a position to}} receive nuclear material the IAEA's request for access was not justified, and requested that the IAEA not schedule an inspection to verify <b>design</b> <b>information.</b> The Agency says its right to verify <b>design</b> <b>information</b> provided to it is a [...] "continuing right, which is not dependent on the stage of construction of, or the presence of nuclear material at, a facility." ...|$|E

The {{flight control system}} proved the greatest challenge to the design team, systems had to be devised to control the aircraft in slow or hovering flight. This was to be achieved by swivelling the lift engines in their mounts combined with varying the thrust of each engine to provide control in pitch, roll and yaw. The lift engines {{were said to be}} a useful safety feature in the event of failure of the main 'cruise' engines.

2500|$|In June 1998, Weldon {{served on}} the Select Committee on U.S. National Security and Military/Commercial Concerns with the People’s Republic of China, perhaps {{better known as the}} [...] "Cox Committee." [...] The committee, five Republicans and four Democrats, {{investigated}} whether the Clinton Administration's waivers allowing U.S. military contractors to transfer military technology to China damaged national security. According to officials who have been briefed about its contents, the report concludes that Beijing's acquisition of secret American weapons designs was part of an intelligence collection effort that spanned 20 years, including both Republican and Democratic Administrations. It also enumerates an array of thefts from the Government's weapons labs, including classified information about seven advanced nuclear warheads, among them the W-88, the most sophisticated nuclear weapon in the American arsenal; that theft is believed to have occurred during the Reagan or Bush Administrations. The report also says that China stole <b>design</b> <b>information</b> about the neutron bomb.|$|E
