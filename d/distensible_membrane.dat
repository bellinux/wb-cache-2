40|$|A novel type {{of liquid}} microlens, bounded by a microfabricated, <b>distensible</b> <b>membrane</b> and {{activated}} by a microfluidic liquid-handling system, is presented. By {{use of an}} elastomer membrane fabricated by spin coating onto a dry-etched silicon substrate, the liquid-filled cavity acts as a lens whereby applied pressure changes the membrane distension and thus the focal length. Both plano–convex and plano–concave lenses, individual elements as well as arrays, were fabricated and tested. The lens surface roughness was seen to be 9 nm rms, and the focal length could be tuned from 1 to 18 mm. This lens represents a robust, self-contained tunable optical structure suitable for use in, for example, a medical environment. © 200...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{low-cost}} micro-incubator for {{the imaging}} of dynamic processes in living cells and tissues has been developed. This micro-incubator provides a tunable environment {{which can be}} altered to study the response of cell monolayers for several days as well as relatively thick tissue samples and tissue engineered epithelial tissues in experiments lasting several hours. Samples within the incubator are contained in a sterile cavity closed by a gas permeable membrane. The incubator can be positioned in any direction and used on an inverted {{as well as on}} an upright microscope. The temperature is regulated with a Peltier system controlled with a sensor positioned close to the sample to be able to compensate for any changes in temperature. Rapid changes in the environment {{can be applied to the}} sample because of the fast response of the Peltier system and the sample's adaptations to induced changes in the environment can be monitored. To evaluate the performance of the micro-incubator we report on studies using cultured cells in monolayers, on monolayers of cells stretched to breaking point on a <b>distensible</b> <b>membrane,</b> on cells in open 3 D fibrous scaffolds and on fluorescently labelled polymersome penetration into 3 D tissue engineered oral mucosa...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{in general}} are {{characterized}} by a high potassium and a low sodium content. This applies both to the animal kind with freely <b>distensible</b> <b>membranes</b> and to the plant variety with comparatively rigid membranes. In the animal organism, whether this is unicellular or multicellular, the K content of the cell is always much {{greater than that of}} its environment and the Na content in general is much lower. Why should this be so? One kind of explanation was developed by Macallum (vide his review, 1926) relating the inorganic components of the cell to a very early marine environment presumably much richer in K than in Na and referring also the inorganic composition of the plasma to that of the ocean when an independent circulatory system was developed. The incorrectness of such views has been sufficiently dealt with elsewhere (Conway, 1943). Another type of explanation was advanced in recent years by Ling (1952). The preferential concentrating of K ions as compared with Na is attributed to the smaller size of the hydrated K ion and the existence of a zone of reduce...|$|R
40|$|A porous, <b>distensible,</b> tubular <b>membrane</b> which {{incorporates}} albumin {{and basic}} Fibroblast Growth Factor (bFGF), and is potentially utilizable as a bioactive small-diameter vascular prosthesis, was fabricated {{by a combined}} spraying, phase-inversion technique using a suspension of albumin and bFGF into a polyetherurethane-urea (Biomer) solution in dimethylacetamide (DMA). Scanning electron microscopy showed a material with an open-cell trabecular structure and small particles of albumin and/or bFGF entrapped in {{the bulk of the}} polyurethane trabeculae. The material released albumin and bFGF at an approximately constant rate for at least 2 weeks. The bFGF initially incorporated in the polymer remained biologically active as shown by in-vitro proliferation of human endothelial cells...|$|R
40|$|AbstractMany {{epithelial}} tissues expand rapidly during embryonic development {{while remaining}} {{surrounded by a}} basement membrane. Remodeling of the basement membrane is assumed to occur during branching morphogenesis to accommodate epithelial growth, but how such remodeling occurs is not yet clear. We report that the basement membrane is highly dynamic during branching of the salivary gland, exhibiting both local and global remodeling. At {{the tip of the}} epithelial end bud, the basement membrane becomes perforated by hundreds of well-defined microscopic holes at regions of rapid expansion. Locally, this results in a <b>distensible,</b> mesh-like basement <b>membrane</b> for controlled epithelial expansion while maintaining tissue integrity. Globally, the basement membrane translocates rearward as a whole, accumulating around the forming secondary ducts, helping to stabilize them during branching. Both local and global dynamics of the basement membrane require protease and myosin II activity. Our findings suggest that the basement <b>membrane</b> is rendered <b>distensible</b> by proteolytic degradation to allow it to be moved and remodeled by cells through actomyosin contractility to support branching morphogenesis...|$|R
