GPs are characterized by their huge energy, power-law cumulative energy distribution, and particular longitudes of occurrence. All these characteristics are different from those of regular pulses. Here, we present a study of GPs from our observations of the pulsar B 1937 + 21 with the GBT at 2. 1 GHz in both left and right circular polarization with a time resolution of 8 ns. The Mark 5 data acquisition system was used {{for the first time in}} single-dish observations with the GBT.

40|$|The {{instantaneous}} linewidth {{of rapidly}} wavelength-swept laser sources as used for {{optical coherence tomography}} (OCT) is of crucial interest for {{a deeper understanding of}} physical effects involved in their operation. Swept lasers for OCT, typically sweeping over ~ 15 THz in ~ 10 μs, have linewidths of several gigahertz. The high optical-frequency sweep speed makes it impossible to measure the <b>instantaneous</b> <b>spectrum</b> with standard methods. Hence, up to now, experimental access to the instantaneous linewidth was rather indirect by the inverse Fourier transform of the coherence decay.
