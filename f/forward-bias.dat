An example apparatus includes a semipolar or nonpolar GaN-based substrate, a reverse- biased waveguide modulator section, and a <b>forward-biased</b> gain section based on InGaN/GaN quantum-well active regions, wherein the <b>forward-biased</b> gain section is grown on the semipolar or nonpolar GaN-based substrate.

50|$|However, diodes {{can have}} more {{complicated}} behavior than this simple on-off action, because of their nonlinear current-voltage characteristics. Semiconductor diodes begin conducting electricity only if a certain threshold voltage or cut-in voltage {{is present in the}} forward direction (a state in which the diode is said to be <b>forward-biased).</b> The voltage drop across a <b>forward-biased</b> diode varies only a little with the current, and is a function of temperature; this effect {{can be used as a}} temperature sensor or as a voltage reference.|$|R

50|$|The <b>forward-bias</b> and the reverse-bias {{properties}} of the p-n junction imply {{that it can be}} used as a diode. A p-n junction diode allows electric charges to flow in one direction, but not in the opposite direction; negative charges (electrons) can easily flow through the junction from n to p but not from p to n, and the reverse is true for holes. When the p-n junction is forward-biased, electric charge flows freely due to reduced resistance of the p-n junction. When the p-n junction is reverse-biased, however, the junction barrier (and therefore resistance) becomes greater and charge flow is minimal.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of future electronic-photonic integrated circuits (EPIC) based on silicon technology critically {{depends on the}} availability of CMOS-compatible high-speed modulators that enable the interaction of electronic and optical signals. This thesis investigates electrically driven Mach-Zehnder modulators based on high-index contrast silicon waveguide technology and electronic carrier injection. Modulators based on four different structures are investigated: the <b>forward-biased</b> PiN diode with and without lifetime reduction, the reverse-biased PIN/PN diode and a metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) structure. These devices are compared with each other in terms of achievable performance. A modulator based on the <b>forward-biased</b> PIN diode with lifetime reduction is designed to reach 34 GHz bandwdith and a low figure of merit V,-L = 0. 6 V-cm using a carrier lifetime reduction and a graded doping profile. A bandwidth of 1 - 2 GHz has been demonstrated so far which is considerably smaller than the design bandwidth due to high series resistance.

50|$|In a 5.6 V diode, the two effects occur together, {{and their}} {{temperature}} coefficients nearly {{cancel each other}} out, thus the 5.6 V diode is useful in temperature-critical applications. An alternative, which is used for voltage references {{that need to be}} highly stable over long periods of time, is to use a Zener diode with a temperature coefficient (TC) of +2 mV/°C (breakdown voltage 6.2-6.3 V) connected in series with a <b>forward-biased</b> silicon diode (or a transistor B-E junction) manufactured on the same chip. The <b>forward-biased</b> diode has a temperature coefficient of −2 mV/°C, causing the TCs to cancel out.|$|R
5000|$|Improving the diode is an {{important}} challenge. There are two challenging requirements: Speed and nonlinearity. First, the diode must have sufficient speed to rectify visible light. Second, unless the incoming light is extremely intense, the diode needs to be extremely nonlinear (much higher forward current than reverse current), {{in order to avoid}} [...] "reverse-bias leakage". An assessment for solar energy collection found that, to get high efficiency, the diode would need a (dark) current much lower than 1μA at 1V reverse bias. This assessment assumed (optimistically) that the antenna was a directional antenna array pointing directly at the sun; a rectenna that collects light from the whole sky, like a typical silicon solar cell does, would need the reverse-bias current to be even lower still, by orders of magnitude. (The diode simultaneously needs a high <b>forward-bias</b> current, related to impedance-matching to the antenna.) ...|$|E
50|$|With {{a battery}} {{connected}} this way, {{the holes in}} the p-type region and the electrons in the n-type region are pushed toward the junction and start to neutralize the depletion zone, reducing its width. The positive potential applied to the p-type material repels the holes, while the negative potential applied to the n-type material repels the electrons. The change in potential between the p side and the n side decreases or switches sign. With increasing <b>forward-bias</b> voltage, the depletion zone eventually becomes thin enough that the zone's electric field cannot counteract charge carrier motion across the p-n junction, which as a consequence reduces electrical resistance. The electrons that cross the p-n junction into the p-type material (or holes that cross into the n-type material) will diffuse into the nearby neutral region. The amount of minority diffusion in the near-neutral zones determines the amount of current that may flow through the diode.|$|E
5000|$|Another major {{challenge}} for perovskite solar cells is {{the observation that}} current-voltage scans yield ambiguous efficiency values.The power-conversion efficiency of a solar cell is usually determined by characterizing its current-voltage (IV) behavior under simulated solar illumination. In contrast to other solar cells, however, {{it has been observed}} that the IV-curves of perovskite solar cells show a hysteretic behavior: depending on scanning conditions - such as scan direction, scan speed, light soaking, biasing - there is a discrepancy between the scan from <b>forward-bias</b> to short-circuit (FB-SC) and the scan from short-circuit to forward bias (SC-FB). Various causes have been proposed such as ion movement, polarization, ferroelectric effects, filling of trap states, [...] however, the exact origin for the hysteretic behavior is yet to be determined. But it appears that determining the solar cell efficiency from IV-curves risks producing inflated values if the scanning parameters exceed the time-scale which the perovskite system requires in order to reach an electronic steady-state. Two possible solutions have been proposed: Unger et al. show that extremely slow voltage-scans allow the system to settle into steady-state conditions at every measurement point which thus eliminates any discrepancy between the FB-SC and the SC-FB scan. Henry Snaith et al. have proposed 'stabilized power output' as a metric for the efficiency of a solar cell. This value is determined by holding the tested device at a constant voltage around the maximum power-point (where the product of voltage and photocurrent reaches its maximum value) and track the power-output until it reaches a constant value.Both methods have been demonstrated to yield lower efficiency values when compared to efficiencies determined by fast IV-scans. However, initial studies have been published that show that surface passivation of the perovskite absorber is an avenue with which efficiency values can be stabilized very close to fast-scan efficiencies.Initial reports suggest that in the 'inverted architecture', which has a transparent cathode, little to no hysteresis is observed. This suggests that the interfaces might play a crucial role with regards to the hysteretic IV behavior since the major difference of the inverted architecture to the regular architectures is that an organic n-type contact is used instead of a metal oxide.|$|E

50|$|Newer CMOS {{output buffers}} using lightly doped {{silicide}} drains are more ESD sensitive; the N-channel driver usually suffers {{damage in the}} oxide layer or n+/p well junction. This is caused by current crowding during the snapback of the parasitic NPN transistor. In P/NMOS totem-pole structures, the NMOS transistor is almost always the one damaged. The structure of the junction influences its ESD sensitivity; corners and defects can lead to current crowding, reducing the damage threshold. <b>Forward-biased</b> junctions are less sensitive than reverse-biased ones because the Joule heat of <b>forward-biased</b> junctions is dissipated through a thicker layer of the material, {{as compared to the}} narrow depletion region in reverse-biased junction.|$|R
