40|$|Objective. To {{explore how}} three {{different}} assumptions on demographics affect the health impact of Danish emitted {{air pollution in}} Denmark from 2005 to 2030, with health impact modeled from 2005 to 2050. Methods. Modeled air pollution from Danish sources was used as exposure in a newly developed health impact assessment model, which models four major diseases and mortality causes in addition to all-cause mortality. The modeling was at the municipal level, which divides the approximately 5. 5 [*]M residents in Denmark into 99 municipalities. Three sets of <b>demographic</b> <b>assumptions</b> were used: (1) a static year 2005 population, (2) morbidity and mortality fixed at the year 2005 level, or (3) an expected development. Results. The health impact of air pollution was estimated at 672, 000, 290, 000, and 280, 000 lost life years depending on <b>demographic</b> <b>assumptions</b> and the corresponding social costs at 430. 4 [*]M€, 317. 5 [*]M€, and 261. 6 [*]M€ through the modeled years 2005 – 2050.

40|$|Abstract Darwin saw {{similarities}} between the evolution of species {{and the evolution of}} languages, and it is now widely accepted that {{similarities between}} related languages can often be interpreted in terms of a bifurcating descent history (‘phylogenesis’). Such interpretations are supported when the distributions of shared and unshared traits (for example, in terms of etymological roots for elements of basic vocabulary) are analysed using tree-building techniques and found to be well-explained by a phylogenetic model. In this article, we question the <b>demographic</b> <b>assumption</b> which is sometimes made when a tree-building approach has been taken to a set of cultures or languages, namely that the resulting tree is also representative of a bifurcating population history. Using historical census data relating to Gaelic- and English-speaking inhabitants of Sutherland (Highland Scotland), we have explored the dynamics of language death due to language shift, representing the extreme case of lack of congruence between the genetic and the culture–historical processes. Such cases highlight the important role of selective cultural migration (or shifting between branches) in determining the extinction rates of different languages on such trees...|$|R

While previous work has addressed the mathematical description of TB natural history, the impact of demography on the behaviour of TB models has not been assessed. Methods: A simple model of TB transmission, with alternative assumptions about survivorship, is used to explore the effect of age structure on the prevalence of infection, disease, basic reproductive ratio and the projected impact of control interventions. We focus our analytic arguments on the differences between constant and exponentially distributed lifespans and use an individual-based model to investigate the range of behaviour arising from realistic distributions of survivorship. Results: The choice of age structure and natural (non-disease related) mortality strongly affects steady-state dynamics, parameter estimation and predictions about the effectiveness of control interventions. Since most individuals infected with TB develop an asymptomatic latent infection and never progress to active disease, we find that assuming a constant mortality rate results in a larger reproductive ratio and an overestimation of the effort required for disease control in comparison to using more realistic age-specific mortality rates.

Considered vitally important, not only for humanity’s well-being but also for ecosystem integrity, the relationship between water use and economic growth has traditionally garnered little attention by analysts. This paper studies water use trends from 1900 to 2000 throughout the world, and their main determinants. To do this, we first analyse historical water use trajectories. Second, to proceed with the determinants of water use, we reformulate the IPAT equation (Ehrlich and Holdren, 1971; Commoner et al. 1971), decomposing water use trends into changes in economic demands and in water use intensity. Finally, a simple scenario analysis is conducted, to project future water use trends under different economic, <b>demographic</b> and technological <b>assumptions.</b> The empirical evidence shows that economic and population growth have been crucial for explaining the increase in water use over the past 100 years, with significant regional differences.

The methodology {{has been used in}} the power market studies of some Brazilian distribution utilities. The methodology is based on decomposition of the total electricity residential consumption in three components: average consumption per consumer unit, electrification rate and number of households. Then, the forecast for the total electricity consumption in residential sector is the product of forecasts for these three components. The prediction for the number of households is based on demographic models while the future trajectory of the electrification rate is defined by the targets for achieving the universal access to electricity. The product of these two components provides a forecast to the number of residential customers. The average consumption per unit consumer depends on the macroeconomic scenarios for GDP, average household income and income distribution. The proposed methodology provides a framework to integrate macroeconomic scenario, <b>demographic</b> projection and <b>assumptions</b> for ownership and efficiency of electric appliances in a long-term demand forecast. In order to illustrate the application of the proposed methodology, this paper presents a ten-year demand forecasts for the residential sector in Brazil...|$|R
