They're a bit cooler about <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that,</b> so they think of the characters they create as being {{in love with a}} person, rather than a boy or a girl." ...|$|E
500|$|One of Jenny's storylines {{in season}} two was her revelation of being sexually abused as a child. The events were portrayed {{in a series}} of flashbacks and dream sequences. Yet, this left viewers {{confused}} about what actually happened to Jenny. During an interview with LGBT monthly magazine The Advocate, Chaiken commented about the storyline: [...] "Well we all know it was an incident of sexual abuse. I had not wanted to be more explicit about <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> – one because memory of trauma is very strange. Who knows what happened to Jenny? Jenny doesn't necessarily know herself." ...|$|E

It proposes nothing save and except to restore this {{government}} to its original tone in regard to this element of slavery, and there to maintain it, looking for no further change in reference to <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that</b> which the original framers of the Government themselves expected and looked forward to." ...|$|E

2500|$|For Alexander {{to marry}} a {{daughter}} of Darius made good political sense, allying himself firmly with the Persian ruling class, but for Hephaestion to marry her sister shows the high esteem in which Alexander held him, bringing him into the royal family itself. They became brothers-in-law, and yet {{there was more to}} <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> Alexander, says Arrian [...] "...wanted to be uncle to Hephaestion's children...". Thus it is possible to imagine Alexander and Hephaestion hoping that their respective offspring might unite their lines and that, ultimately, the crown of Macedon and Persia might be worn by one who was a descendant of them both.|$|E
2500|$|To {{shape the}} science of the film, Boyle and Garland hired {{scientific}} advisers, including NASA employees and astrophysicists. Brian Cox, a professor of particle physics at the University of Manchester, was hired to advise {{the cast and crew}} after the director had seen Cox on the science TV series Horizon. Cox gave regular lectures to the film's cast members about solar physics, and also advised the filmmakers to scale down the nuclear device in the film from the mass of the Moon to the size of Manhattan. In the film's backstory, a Q-ball enters and is caught in the Earth's Sun, and begins to eat it away. According to Cox, the Sun would not be dense enough in real life to stop a Q-ball, but filmmakers took creative licence in writing the backstory. Cox noted in the DVD commentary that several inaccuracies were permitted to allow for plot. He also dismissed criticisms of the film by scientists: [...] "Sunshine is not a documentary. It's trying to just, in an hour and forty minutes, get across a feeling of what it's like – not only to be a scientist, because obviously there's much more in <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> So, I found it interesting to watch the kind of people that get upset because the gravity is wrong." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are some}} fairly {{widespread}} {{questions as to}} whether or not the speaker may have a homosexual love interest in his friend the young man. This idea is hard to prove one way or the other but has been acknowledged by many writers and scholars such as Professor Robert Matz from George Mason University. It is difficult to tell if the speaker has a genuine respect and admiration for his friend or if there is more to <b>it</b> <b>than</b> <b>that.</b> However, this debate always comes down to personal opinions and it is up to the reader to decide what they would like to believe. [...] Shakespeare uses many descriptions in this sonnet that are interpreted as sexual references. Renowned Shakespeare critic Joseph Pequigney writes in his book Such is my Love that line 10, [...] "makes the most open reference to auto-eroticism. Being infecund, it involves both the expenditure of seed for self-gratification and withholding it from reproduction". As Pequigney explains, in this sonnet not only is the speaker trying to convince his friend the young man to have children, but he is making an argument against masturbation, which is something the speaker sees as selfish and a waste of the young man's great genetics. This line also contributes to the reason why this sonnet has been called [...] "A Disquisition Forbidding Masturbation" [...] by Joseph Pequigney. This subject of masturbation goes hand in hand with the idea of being alone and dying without producing children or heirs, something which the speaker thinks would be a selfish act and would deprive the future earth of beauty.|$|E
