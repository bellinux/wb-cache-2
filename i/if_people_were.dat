Author Jason Epstein commented that the movie gives the impression that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> smart enough or lucky enough, they could survive the Holocaust; this was not actually the case. Spielberg responded to criticism that Schindler's breakdown as he says farewell is too maudlin and even out of character by pointing out that the scene is needed to drive home the sense of loss and to allow the viewer an opportunity to mourn alongside the characters on the screen.|$|E

Any decisions that needed to be made were reached by finding a consensus between all the families of the band. Although the chief was the advisor of the band there was no guarantee that he would stay at the top. The only way the chief stayed in his position was <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> being fed and the band staved off attacks from enemy bands.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Talmudic rabbis are divided between those who seek {{the purpose of the}} mitzvot {{and those who do not}} question them. The latter argue that if the reason for each mitzvah could be determined, people might try to achieve what they see as the purpose of the mitzvah, without actually performing the mitzvah itself (lishmah), which would become self-defeating. The former believe that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> to understand the reason and the purpose for each mitzvah, it would actually help them to observe and perform the mitzvah (some mitzvot are given reasons in the Torah).|$|E
25|$|The Tactical Command, {{headed by}} Cilia Flores, Guillermo García Ponce and Freddy Bernal, then shared plans {{of using the}} Bolivarian Circles as a {{paramilitary}} force to end marches and also defend Chávez by organizing them into brigades.

They also discussed launching a disinformation propaganda campaign on public and private television and having government loyalists fill the highways with their vehicles and then present the images on TV as <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> busy working like any other day. In another plan to end the strike, Gastón Parra, the president of PDVSA, suggested to give bonuses to PDVSA employees who chose not to participate in the strike.|$|E

500|$|Ade Irwansyah, {{writing for}} Tabloid Bintang, {{notes that the}} film is a [...] "microcosm" [...] of Indonesia, which has {{numerous}} religious groups that often come into conflict. Irwansyah writes that Bramantyo intended for viewers {{to think of the}} religious conflicts that happen daily, and how to deal with differences in culture and beliefs, while Bramantyo has called the film his own personal interpretation of the country's religious situation. The film critic Eric Sasono noted this was apparent from the film's tagline, [...] "Is it still important that we are different?", and suggested that Bramantyo feared that Indonesia was becoming a monolithic state. According to Sasono, the conflict in ? is settled when the characters begin believing that all religions are good, and all praise God; thus, all religious conflict would end <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> to accept other beliefs.|$|E
500|$|Back in Los Angeles, Beck {{began to}} work at a video store in Silver Lake [...] "doing things like {{alphabetizing}} the pornography section". He began performing in arthouse clubs and coffeehouses such as Al's Bar and Raji's. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking. So maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> listening," [...] he later remarked. Virtually an unknown to the public and an enigma to those who met him, Beck would hop onstage between acts in local clubs and play [...] "strange folk songs", accompanied by [...] "what could best be described as performance art" [...] while sometimes wearing a Star Wars stormtrooper mask. Beck met someone who offered to help record demos in his living room, and he began to pass cassette tapes around.|$|E

500|$|Wollstonecraft {{and other}} {{political}} radicals during {{the last quarter of}} the 18th century focused their reform efforts on education because they believed that <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> educated correctly, Britain would experience a moral and political revolution. Religious Dissenters, especially, embraced this view; Wollstonecraft's philosophy in Thoughts and elsewhere closely resembles that of the Dissenters she met while teaching in Newington Green, such as the theologian, educator, and scientist Joseph Priestley and the minister Richard Price. Dissenters [...] "were most concerned with molding children into people of good moral character and habits". However, political conservatives, who also believed that childhood was the crucial time for the formation of a person's character, used their own educational works to deflect rebellion by promoting theories of compliance. Liberals and conservatives alike subscribed to Lockean and Hartleian associationist psychology: that is, they believed that a person's sense of self was built up through a set of associations made between things in the external world and ideas in the mind. Both Locke and Hartley had argued that the associations formed in childhood were nearly irreversible and must thus be formed with care. Locke famously advised parents to keep their children away from servants, as they would only tell children frightening stories that would foster a fear of the dark.|$|E
500|$|The song {{has been}} {{described}} by several critics as a masterpiece. In 2004, Rolling Stone magazine placed the song at No.404 on their list of the 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, commenting that Dylan [...] "never sounded lonelier than in this seven-minute ballad, cut in a single take on Valentine's Day 1966." [...] (When Rolling Stone updated their list in 2010, the song dropped to No.413.) In 1999, Britain's Poet Laureate, Andrew Motion, chose it as his candidate for the best song lyric ever written. Motion praised [...] "the concentration and surprise" [...] of Dylan's lyrics, and said that, although he distanced himself from some of the singer's views about women, the [...] "rasp of his anger" [...] was a part of his greatness. The International Observer named the song the second best ever recorded in 2017, stating, [...] "The 24 year old Dylan was beginning to realize that no matter how many perfect songs he wrote he could not achieve immortality through his art as he perhaps once believed, because even <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> still listening to the music in 500 years, he would still be dead." [...] Commenting on the song in a 1985 interview, Dylan said, [...] "I still sing that song every once in a while. It still stands up now as it did then, maybe even more in some kind of weird way." ...|$|E
500|$|In August 1996, {{the band}} {{performed}} two concerts before crowds of 250,000 at Knebworth House, Hertfordshire, while more than 2,500,000 fans had applied for tickets. The dates {{were to be}} the zenith of Oasis's popularity, and both the music press and the band realised {{it would not be}} possible for the band to equal the event. By this time however, there was much instability and internal conflict emerging between the band members. On 23 August 1996, vocalist Liam Gallagher refused to sing for an MTV Unplugged performance at London's Royal Festival Hall, pleading a sore throat. Though he did attend the concert, he spent the evening heckling Noel from the upper level balcony. Four days later, Liam declined to participate in the first leg of an American tour, complaining that he needed to buy a house with his then girlfriend Patsy Kensit. He re-joined the band a few days after for a key concert at the MTV Video Music Awards in New York, but intentionally sang off-key and spat beer and saliva during the performance. The following day, The Sun led with the front page headline [...] "America sickened by obscene Liam's spitting rampage." [...] Amongst much internal bickering, the tour continued—with Liam—to Charlotte, North Carolina, where Noel finally lost his patience with his brother and announced he was leaving the band. He later admitted [...] "If the truth be known, I didn't want to be there anyway. I wasn't prepared to be in the band <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> being like that to each other." ...|$|E

2500|$|False necessity, or anti-necessitarian social theory, is a {{contemporary}} social theory that argues for the plasticity of social organizations {{and their potential}} to be shaped in new ways. [...] The theory rejects the assumption that laws of change govern the history of human societies and limit human freedom. It is a critique of [...] "necessitarian" [...] thought in conventional social theories (like liberalism or Marxism) which hold that parts {{of the social order}} are necessary or the result of the natural flow of history. The theory rejects the idea that human societies must be organized in a certain way (for example, liberal democracy) and that human activity will adhere to certain forms (for example <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> only motivated by rational self-interest).|$|E

He {{returned to his}} hometown of Los Angeles in early 1991, due to his financial struggles. Described by biographer Julian Palacios as having [...] "no opportunities whatsoever", Beck worked low-wage jobs to survive, but still found time to perform his songs at local coffeehouses and clubs. In order to keep indifferent audiences engaged in his music, Beck would play in a spontaneous, joking manner. [...] "I'd be banging away on a Son House tune and the whole audience would be talking, so maybe out of desperation or boredom, or the audience's boredom, I'd make up these ridiculous songs just to see <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> listening.

But <b>if</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> to watch it with no knowledge of who directed, they would be pleasantly surprised. They might even find much of it enjoyable."
