Besides and improved man-machine interaction, the introduction in a PABX environment of the speech processing currently available allows an easier and more extensive use of the facilities offered by a current PABX. At FACE-RC a demonstrative system that make use of speaker independent, continuos speech recognizer and speech waveform synthetizer for messaging has been developed. In this paper the technical aspects will be described. It will be noted that an {{application of}} speech processing must consider carefully the actual limits of the current technology in order to obtain a successfull implementation...|$|R

50|$|A first {{demonstration}} of <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> TV set to public and committee {{was made in}} Tashkent in summer 1928 by Boris Grabovsky and his team. In his method that had been patented in Saratov in 1925, Boris Grabovsky proposed a new principle of TV imaging based on the vertical and horizontal electron beam sweeping under high voltage. Nowadays this principle of the TV imaging is used practically in all modern cathode-ray tubes. Historian and ethnographer Boris Golender (Борис Голендер in Russian), in a video lecture, described this event. This date of {{demonstration of}} the <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> TV set is the earliest known so far. Despite this fact, most modern historians disputably consider Vladimir Zworykin and Philo Farnsworth as inventors of the first <b>fully</b> <b>electronic</b> TV set. In 1964, the contribution made {{to the development of}} early television by Grabovsky was officially acknowledged by the Uzbek government and he was awarded the prestigious degree, 'Honorable Inventor of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic'.|$|R
