This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM. While MFGM only makes up an estimated 2% to 6% of the total milk fat globule, it is an especially rich phospholipid source, accounting for the majority of total milk phospholipids. In contrast, the inner core of the milk fat globule is composed predominantly of triacylglycerols.|$|E
5|$|The {{periodontal}} ligament is {{a specialized}} connective tissue that attaches the cementum of a tooth to the alveolar bone. This tissue covers {{the root of}} the tooth within the bone. Each ligament has a width of 0.15–0.38mm, but this size decreases over time. The functions of the periodontal ligaments include attachment of the tooth to the bone, support for the tooth, formation and resorption of bone during tooth movement, sensation, and eruption. The cells of the periodontal ligaments include osteoblasts, osteoclasts, fibroblasts, macrophages, cementoblasts, and <b>epithelial</b> <b>cell</b> rests of Malassez. Consisting of mostly Type I and III collagen, the fibers are grouped in bundles and named according to their location. The groups of fibers are named alveolar crest, horizontal, oblique, periapical, and interradicular fibers. The nerve supply generally enters from the bone apical to the tooth and forms a network around the tooth toward the crest of the gingiva. When pressure is exerted on a tooth, such as during chewing or biting, the tooth moves slightly in its socket and puts tension on the periodontal ligaments. The nerve fibers can then send the information to the central nervous system for interpretation.|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Differentiated {{paediatric}} <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> {{can be used}} {{to study}} the role of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in asthma. Nasal <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> are easier to obtain and may act as a surrogate for bronchial epithelium in asthma studies. We assessed the suitability of nasal epithelium from asthmatic children to be a surrogate for bronchial epithelium using air-liquid interface cultures. METHODS: Paired nasal and bronchial <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> from asthmatic children (n =  9) were differentiated for 28 days under unstimulated and IL- 13 -stimulated conditions. Morphological and physiological markers were analysed using immunocytochemistry, transepithelial-electrical-resistance, Quantitative Real-time-PCR, ELISA and multiplex cytokine/chemokine analysis. RESULTS: Physiologically, nasal <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> from asthmatic children exhibit similar cytokine responses to stimulation with IL- 13 compared with paired bronchial <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Morphologically however, nasal <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> differed significantly from bronchial <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> from asthmatic patients under unstimulated and IL- 13 -stimulated conditions. Nasal <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> exhibited lower proliferation/differentiation rates and lower percentages of goblet and ciliated cells when unstimulated, while exhibiting a diminished and varied response to IL- 13. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that morphologically, nasal <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> would not be a suitable surrogate due to a significantly lower rate of proliferation and differentiation of goblet and ciliated <b>cells.</b> Physiologically, nasal <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> respond similarly to exogenous stimulation with IL- 13 in cytokine production and {{could be used as a}} physiological surrogate in the event that bronchial <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> are not available...|$|R
40|$|Oropharyngeal mucosal epithelia of fetuses/neonates/infants and the genital epithelia {{of adults}} play a {{critical}} role in HIV- 1 mother-to-child transmission and sexual transmission of virus, respectively. To study the mechanisms of HIV- 1 transmission through mucosal epithelium, we established polarized tonsil, cervical and foreskin <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells.</b> Analysis of HIV- 1 transmission through <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> showed that approximately 0. 05 % of initially inoculated virions transmigrated via epithelium. More than 90 % of internalized virions were sequestered in the endosomes of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells,</b> including multivesicular bodies (MVBs) and vacuoles. Intraepithelial HIV- 1 remained infectious for 9 days without viral release. Release of sequestered intraepithelial HIV- 1 was induced by the calcium ionophore ionomycin and by cytochalasin D, which increase intracellular calcium and disrupt the cortical actin of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells,</b> respectively. Cocultivation of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> containing HIV- 1 with activated peripheral blood mononuclear cells and CD 4 + T lymphocytes led to the disruption of epithelial cortical actin and spread of virus from <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> to lymphocytes. Treatment of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> with proinflammatory cytokines tumor necrosis factor-alpha and interferon gamma also induced reorganization of cortical actin and release of virus. Inhibition of MVB formation by small interfering RNA (siRNA) -mediated silencing of its critical protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) expression reduced viral sequestration in <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> and its transmission from <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> to lymphocytes by ~ 60 - 70 %. Furthermore, inhibition of vacuole formation of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> by siRNA-inactivated rabankyrin- 5 expression also significantly reduced HIV- 1 sequestration in <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> and spread of virus from <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> to lymphocytes. Interaction of the intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 of <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> with the function-associated antigen- 1 of lymphocytes was important for inducing the release of sequestered HIV- 1 from <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> and facilitating cell-to-cell spread of virus from <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> to lymphocytes. This mechanism may serve as a pathway of HIV- 1 mucosal transmission...|$|R

Methods: The normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> were dissociated by digestion with collagenase type Ⅰ. The morphological identification of normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture was determined under inverted phase contrast microscope and transmission electron microscope. The estradiol and progesterone were added to culture medium to induce the proliferation of normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture, and the different doses of Chinese herbal medicine for warming kidney and tamoxifen were also added into the culture medium. The MTT assay was used to {{evaluate the}} proliferation of normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture under the different conditions of interventions. Results: The normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture presented typically morphological features of normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in vitro. The proliferation of normal human mammary <b>epithelial</b> <b>cells</b> in primary culture was significantly improved by intervention of estradiol and progesterone both with concentration of 1 × 10 － 5 g/L.
