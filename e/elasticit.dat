40|$|Summary. Design ing housing {{policies}} and programmes requires a carefu l estimation of house-hold affordability {{and demand for}} housing. The ef ® ciency of housing subsidies would depend on price <b>elasticit</b> ies of housing demand. Differen t households have differen t percep tions of housing demand based on their economic and demographic factors. We estimate the demand function of housing for urban India using step econometric analysis. The ® rst step estimates the hedonic price index for states {{and in the second}} step the demand for housing is estim ated as a function of economic and household character istics. The problem of multicollin earity is observed with the data. Ridge regressio ns are used to correct for multicollin earity and to obtain ef ® cien t estimates. The results indicate that the housing demand is inelastic with respect to incom e and price. The incom e <b>elasticit</b> y is 0. 75 while price <b>elasticit</b> y is slightly less than 2 1. A further analysis to estimate income and price <b>elasticit</b> ies for differen t incom e classes as well as states has also been carried out.

To support this argument, two steps were followed to understand how climatic factors especially long term average seasonal rainfall and temperature; and agro-ecological settings affect production efficiency in Ethiopian agriculture. In the first step, the stochastic frontier approach was employed to analyze the farm level technical efficiency. In the second step, the tobit regression model was adopted to analyze how climatic and agro-ecological settings affect efficiency scores derived from the first step. Results from the first step indicated that the surveyed farmers have an average technical efficiency of 0. 50; with significant output <b>elasticits</b> of labor, draft power and tractor.

40|$|Summary. The {{paper has}} applied a {{conventional}} framework of analysis of implicit markets to determ ine {{the characteristics of}} demand for housing attributes of quantity and quality in the urban areas of a large, low-income develop ing country like Pakistan. Income <b>elasticit</b> ies generally appear to be low, although somewhat higher for indicators of quality. Own-price <b>elasticit</b> ies are high while the cross-p rice effects with respect to different attribute prices reveal {{the high degree of}} substitutibility among these attributes. Methodological innovation s in the paper include the use of a weighted factor score for the measurement of housing quality and incorporation of the effect of changes in non-housing prices on demand for housing attributes. Given the large magnitude of own-price effects and the negative impact of a rise in non-housing prices, it appears that in the face of slow grow th in real incomes and double-digit in ¯ ation in Pakistan residential overcrowd-ing conditions are likely to worsen over time. 1...|$|E

Development of Peyronie’s disease is likely related to minor injury to the tunica albuginea, septum or intracavernous struts. In some men, the resulting inflammation is trapped between layers of the collagen bundles and becomes progressive. This leads to an inflammatory mass (lump) formation in the early stage. Continuing inflammation produces profibrotic cytokines such as transforming growth factor beta and deposition of large amount of collagen fibers.

The irregularly compacted collagen fibers and disrupted elastic fibers create an inelastic “plaque, ” the “incurable” component of Peyronie’s disease. The loss of <b>elasticit...</b>|$|E

Its mean over the period is 1. 02.

We find that given demographic composition household demand for housing seems to increase proportionately with total consumption, in contrast to other categories such as food and transportation. The empirical regularity between housing expenditures and total consumption yields forecasting potential and may represent a basic pattern of consumption.

40|$|Abstract The aim of {{the paper}} is to study the {{relationship}} of individuals’ sport goods consumption to personal income and relative sport price in Hungary in the period 1992 - 2006. It is shown, that the trend of the real sport goods consumption in conjunction with real income decreased till 2000 {{and it has been}} increasing since then. Income and price elasticity figures for both periods show, that sport goods consumption is price elastic, and sport goods are luxury goods for Hungarian households. Thus, without increased income – i. e. the average standard of living – a more sport conscious Hungarian population can hardly be imagined even if sport goods remained relatively cheap.

Using distribution-sensitive methods, we examine the combined effect of a secular increase in incomes with a one time increase in food prices that occurred in the middle 1990 ’s. We find a dramatic increase in undernutrition between 1991 and 1997, and little change in undernutrition after 1997. Traditional headcounts, which are not distributional-sensitive provide misleading results in some cases. Our income elasticity estimates for calories and protein are generally zero, while we find some evidence that the percentage of fat in the calorie source is a normal good. Overall, it appears that rising incomes in China have not led to improvements in nutrition. Key words: Chinese undernutrition; distribution-sensitive; Sen index; income <b>elasticit...</b>|$|E

We develop a closed-economy partial equilibrium model that allows for the presence of producer heterogeneity in supply response. Analytical results indicate that producers having less elastic supply response capture more benefits per dollar expended than producers with more elastic supply response. The extent of unequal distribution depends on parameters char-acterizing industries. The inequality may not be a significant problem for some industries, especially where the firm-level supply elasticities are not substantially different among producers, but it may be an important issue when industries have substantial differences in firm-level supply elasticities and firm sizes, and experience large demand shifts due to advertising programs.

The {{focal point of the}} analysis is the estimation of end-use-specific income elasticity of electricity demand, for the first time for Sweden. A seemingly unrelated regression framework is used for understanding the determinants of end-use demand, with the end-uses being heating, kitchen, lighting, and residual. The main results of the analysis are: high aggregate elasticity (above 0. 6), and very high income elasticity of electric heating (above 0. 8). Other size-related variables (size of home, number of people) do not appear to have significant explanatory power. Overall, our analysis indicates that income is a key factor determining the demand for electricity, and to a much larger extent than usually considered.

The vessels were anisotropic within most of the physio-logical ranges of tangential and longitudinal stress and strain. During control conditions the tangential modulus of elasticity was higher than the longitudinal; during vasoconstriction the situation was reversed for wall tensions correspond-ing to a blood pressure equal to or smaller than 190 mm Hg; however, above this value isotropic behavior prevailed.

We assume the population growth rate and the technological growth rate to be endogenous; they are assumed to be correlated with the labour supply.

The highest values of analysed technical parameters were recorded for wood of co-dominant trees, the lowest were found for predominant trees, while intermediate values were recorded for wood of dominant trees. All the reported differences were statistically significant.

When returns to capital and wages are imperfectly correlated, the consumption variance of all generations can be reduced if government policies enable them to pool labor and capital incomes. A social security system that endows retired households with a claim to labor income may serve as an effective tool to share aggregate risk between generations. Our quantitative analysis shows that, first, abstracting from the crowding-out effect of social security on the aggregate stock in general equilibrium, the introduction of social security does indeed represent a Pareto improving reform, if households are both fairly risk-averse and fairly willing to intertemporally substitute consumption. Second, the severity of the capital crowding-out effect in general equilibrium overturns these gains for degrees of risk aversion and intertemporal <b>elasticit...</b>|$|E

It turns out that this deformation field provides an insight into the possible appearance of secondary deformation fields for special classes of materials. We also find that these latent deformation fields are woken up by normal stress differences. We present some explicit examples based on the neo-Hookean, the generalized neo-Hookean and the Mooney-Rivlin forms of the strain-energy density. Using the simple exact solution found in the neo-Hookean case, we conjecture that it is advantageous to accompany the usual vertical axial force by a twisting moment, in order to extrude a cork from the neck of a bottle efficiently. Then we analyse departures from the neo-Hookean behaviour by exact and asymptotic analyses.

The model was limited to not including plastic growth and dividing cells. We assumed that the L 1 layer is under tension coming from turgor pressure and interaction with inner tissue. This implies that anticlinal walls of cells are stretched in the plane of the layer and experience tensile stresses. The magnitude of those stresses depends on the exact geometry of the cells and the elastic properties of their walls. The walls of the cells despite being rigidly connected to walls of the neighbors remain associated with each cell. This means that a wall between two cells is represented as two compartments, for which elastic properties are independent.
