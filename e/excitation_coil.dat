50|$|From a {{technical}} standpoint, several subtle prerequisites {{are necessary for}} operation. The strength of the magnetic field of the permanent magnets at the iron band must be of the same order of magnitude as {{the strength of the}} field generated by the radio frequency <b>excitation</b> <b>coil,</b> allowing the radio frequency signal to exceed the threshold hysteresis (coercivity) of the iron. Also, the impedance of the tuner that supplies the radio signal must be low to match the low impedance of the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil,</b> requiring special tuner design considerations. The impedance of the telephone earphone must roughly match the impedance of the audio pickup coil, which is a few hundred ohms. The iron band moves a few millimeters per second. The magnetic detector was much more sensitive than the coherers commonly in use at the time, although not as sensitive as the Fleming valve, which began to replace it around 1912.|$|E
5000|$|Basic RVDT {{construction}} and operation {{is provided by}} rotating an iron-core bearing supported within a housed stator assembly. The housing is passivated stainless steel. The stator consists of a primary <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> {{and a pair of}} secondary output coils.A fixed alternating current excitation is applied to the primary stator coil that is electromagnetically coupled to the secondary coils. This coupling is proportional to the angle of the input shaft. The output pair is structured so that one coil is in-phase with the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil,</b> and the second is 180° out-of-phase with the excitation coil.When the rotor is in a position that directs the available flux equally in both the in-phase and out-of-phase coils, the output voltages cancel and result in a zero value signal. This {{is referred to as the}} electrical zero position or E.Z. When the rotor shaft is displaced from E.Z., the resulting output signals have a magnitude and phase relationship proportional to the direction of rotation.Because RVDTs perform essentially like a transformer, excitation voltages changes will cause directly proportional changes to the output (transformation ratio). However, the voltage out to excitation voltage ratio will remain constant. Since most RVDT signal conditioning systems measure signal as a function of the transformation ratio (TR), excitation voltage drift beyond 7.5% typically has no effect on sensor accuracy and strict voltage regulation is not typically necessary. Excitation frequency should be controlled within ±1% to maintain accuracy ...|$|E

40|$|Metallic {{contaminant}} detectors {{based on}} the balanced coil system are widely used in the food industry. In the balanced coil system, an <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> and two identical pickup coils are used {{in a way that}} the magnetic coupling of pickup coils to the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> is cancelled with each other when no metallic contaminants present. In a conventional system, the <b>excitation</b> <b>coil</b> and the pickup coil are planar and are parallel, therefore the magnetic coupling is strong even if there is no metallic contaminant.

40|$|Abstract — Frequency {{differential}} {{magnetic induction}} tomography allows {{the reconstruction of}} images of relative conductivity spectra {{with the aid of}} magnetic AC fields and coil arrays. We describe a new 16 -channel hardware with an analog bandwidth of 50 kHz – 1. 5 MHz which covers {{a good part of the}} ß-dispersion of many tissues. At each acquisition time 8 of the 16 <b>excitation</b> <b>coils</b> are simultaneously driven by individual power amplifiers with up to 3 A ss at multiple frequencies. These amplifiers are configured as current sources so that every coil termination is high enough so as not to perturb the field of all other coils. For encoding the <b>excitation</b> <b>coils</b> their individual carrier frequencies differ by 200 - 500 Hz. In this way every excitation frequency is split into 8 subcarriers within a bandwidth of 1. 6 - 4 kHz so that they can be approximately considered as a single peak in the comparatively flat tissue spectrum. The magnetic fields are received by 16 planar gradiometers and the induced voltages are amplified by lownoise amplifiers before being fed into the ADC. The real and imaginary parts of the received signals are extracted efficiently with FFT. The SNR is reduced by a factor of 5 when compared to the theoretical limit of our previous single-excitation system but due to the much higher acquisition speed drifts and physiological noise are considerably lower...|$|R
