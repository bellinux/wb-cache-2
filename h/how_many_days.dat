5|$|Shiryou Sensen: War of the Dead, a 1987 title {{developed}} by Fun Factory {{and published by}} Victor Music Industries for the MSX2, PC-88 and PC Engine platforms, is considered the first true survival horror game by Kevin Gifford (of GamePro and 1UP) and John Szczepaniak (of Retro Gamer and The Escapist). Designed by Katsuya Iwamoto, the game was a horror action RPG revolving around a female SWAT member Lila rescuing survivors in an isolated monster-infested town and bringing them to safety in a church. It has open environments like Dragon Quest and real-time side-view battles like Zelda II, though War of the Dead departed from other RPGs with its dark and creepy atmosphere expressed through the storytelling, graphics, and music. The player character has limited ammunition, though the player character can punch or use a knife if out of ammunition. The game also has a limited item inventory and crates to store items, and introduced a day-night cycle; the player can sleep to recover health, and a record is kept of <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> the player has survived. That same year saw the release of Laplace no Ma, another hybrid of survival horror and RPG, though with more traditional RPG elements such as turn-based combat. It is mostly set in a mansion infested with undead creatures, and the player controls a party of characters with different professions, including a scientist who constructs tools and a journalist who takes pictures. In 1988, War of the Dead Part 2 for the MSX2 and PC-88 abandoned the RPG elements of its predecessor, such as random encounters, and instead adopted action-adventure elements from Metal Gear while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor.|$|E

Walking often is the only way for people to get to their local villages anyway, as many local airstrips are in disrepair. The maintenance of airstrips is a Local Level Government responsibility, and many LLGs in the surrounding area are severely underfunded.|$|E

For the song [...] "Sonnathu Neethaana", the shot where the camera pans beneath Muthuraman's bed and rising out was captured using a camera dolly. The song was filmed with 60different angles being used by the film's cinematographer A. Vincent. Nenjil Or Aalayam was the first Tamil film to be shot entirely on a single set. Filming was completed in less than 30 days, although accounts vary on <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> were exactly taken to complete the shoot. While film historian Randor Guy and K. S. Sivakumaran of Daily News Sri Lanka state that the film was completed in four weeks, Ramya Kannan of The Hindu, and Tamil Canadian journalist D. B. S.

500|$|In August 1968 {{the unit}} created a [...] "Total Encounter Capsule", {{which was a}} windowless, soundproofed room, [...] wide and [...] long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat {{on the floor and}} a ceiling {{containing}} a one-way mirror. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide [...] "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions." [...] Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> he spent inside. Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days. Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with LSD-25. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.|$|E

Thalidomide did not damage the foetus if taken after 42 days gestation.|$|E
2500|$|One day, the Protagonist, {{finds that}} he and his two friends, Atsuro Kihara and Yuzu Tanikawa, have been given {{modified}} electronic device called COMPs by his older cousin, Naoya. As they are exploring their purpose, an outbreak of demons occurs within Tokyo, and a large area of the city is quarantined by the Japanese Ground Self-Defense Forces, denying power, communications, and food to those trapped within. The chaotic situation gives rise to vigilantes who take it upon themselves to fight the demons or even prey on weaker humans. The Protagonist and his friends discover their COMPs allow them to summon helpful demons to fight the aggressive ones, allowing them to survive the attacks. The Protagonist also finds {{he has the ability to}} see a person's [...] "death clock", representing <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> a person will have left to live.

2500|$|A debate {{regarding}} {{whether or}} not Luke and Noah would be allowed a sex scene led AfterElton.com to change their [...] "LipLock Clock" [...] to a [...] "Consummation Clock" [...] which counted <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> the couple had gone without having sex. This was done to try and persuade the producers and writers to portray {{their relationship with the}} same freedoms as they would a heterosexual couple. On January 12, 2009, the clock stopped when the couple finally consummated their relationship; they had sex for the first time, which pleased {{a significant portion of the}} audience. However, the love scene was not shown onscreen. TV Guide columnist Michael Logan said that the lack of promotion for the sex scene may have been a deliberate strategy to avoid giving protesters a chance to pressure the network from cutting the storyline. [...] "Are they being savvy or scared?" [...] he said. [...] "I don’t know." [...] In addition, Logan commented on how long it took the series to have the two become physically intimate with each other. [...] "It was getting goofy-ridiculous how long it took," [...] said Logan. [...] "But it happened. It’s historic, I guess." ...|$|E

2500|$|To find <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> {{the civil}} {{calendar}} {{is ahead of}} the Julian in any year from 301 BCE (the calendar is proleptic [...] up to 1582 CE) add 300 to the year, multiply the hundreds by 7, divide by 9 and subtract 4. Ignore any fraction of a day. When {{the difference between the}} calendars changes the calculated value applies on and from March 1 (civil date) for conversions to Julian. For earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. For conversions to the civil date the calculated value applies on and from February 29 (Julian date). Again, for earlier dates reduce the calculated value by one. The difference is applied to the calendar one is converting into. A negative value indicates that the Julian date is ahead of the civil date. In this case {{it is important to remember}} that when calculating the civil equivalent of February 29 (Julian), February 29 is discounted. Thus if the calculated value is −4 the civil equivalent of this date is February 24. Before 1 CE use astronomical years rather than years BCE. The astronomical year is (year BCE) – 1.|$|E

2500|$|Similarly, Rabbi asked Rabbi Ishmael {{the son of}} Rabbi Jose if he {{had learned}} from his father the actual meaning of [...] "And on the seventh day God {{finished}} the work that He had been doing" [...] (for surely God finished God's work on the sixth day, not the Sabbath). He compared it to a man striking a hammer on an anvil, raising it by day and bringing it down immediately after nightfall. (In the second between raising the hammer and bringing it down, night began. Thus, he taught that God finished God's work {{right at the end}} of the sixth day, so that in that very moment the Sabbath began.) Rabbi Simeon bar Yohai taught that mortal humans, who do not know exactly what time it is, must add from the profane to the sacred to avoid working in the sacred time; but God knows time precisely, can enter the Sabbath by a hair's breadth. Genibah and the Rabbis discussed [...] Genibah compared it to a king who made a bridal chamber, which he plastered, painted, and adorned, so that all that the bridal chamber lacked was a bride to enter it. Similarly, just then, the world lacked the Sabbath. (Thus by means of instituting the Sabbath itself, God completed God's work, and humanity's world, on the seventh day.) The Rabbis compared it to a king who made a ring that lacked only a signet. Similarly, the world lacked the Sabbath. And the Midrash taught that this is one of the texts that they changed for King Ptolemy (as they could not expect him to understand these explanations), making [...] read, [...] "And He finished on the sixth day, and rested on the seventh." [...] King Ptolemy (or others say, a philosopher) asked the elders in Rome <b>how</b> <b>many</b> <b>days</b> it took God to create the world. The elders replied that it took God six days. He replied that since then, Gehenna has been burning for the wicked. Reading the words [...] "His work" [...] in [...] Rabbi Berekiah said in the name of Rabbi Judah the son of Rabbi Simon that with neither labor nor toil did God create the world, yet [...] says, [...] "He rested [...] [...] [...] from all His work." [...] He explained that [...] states it that way to punish the wicked who destroy the world, which was created with labor, and to give a good reward to the righteous who uphold the world, which was created with toil. Reading the words [...] "Because that in it He rested from all His work which God created to make," [...] in [...] the Midrash taught that what was created on the Sabbath, after God rested, was tranquility, ease, peace, and quiet. Rabbi Levi said in the name of Rabbi Jose ben Nehorai that as long as the hands of their Master were working on them, they went on expanding; but when the hands of their Master rested, rest was afforded to them, and thus God gave rest to the world on the seventh day. Rabbi Abba taught that when a mortal king takes his army to their quarters, he does not distribute largesse (rather, he does that only before the troops go into battle), and when he distributes largesse, he does not order a halt. But God ordered a halt and distributed largesse, as [...] says, [...] "And He rested [...] [...] [...] and He blessed." [...] (Not only did God afford humanity a day of rest, but God also gave humanity the gift of a sacred day.) ...|$|E
