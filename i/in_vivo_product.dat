40|$|The use of {{protease}} inhibitors {{causes the}} accumulation of very large polypeptides (polyprotein) in tissue culture cells infected with either poliovirus or echovirus 12. The effectiveness of the inhibitor varies, depending on the cell line chosen. In infected monkey kidney cells, polyprotein is not cleaved when a chymotrypsin inhibitor is added, but in infected HeLa cells a trypsin inhibitor is most effective. Therefore, at least {{a part of the}} proteolytic activity is supplied by the host cell. Extracted viral polyprotein can be cleaved in vitro by trypsin or chymotrypsin. As estimated by migration in sodium dodecyl sulfate gels and antigenicity, chymotrypsin cleavage of the poliovirus polyprotein yields fragments which are similar to the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>product.</b> The polyprotein is not in soluble form but is attached to a fast-sedimenting, membrane-bound structure. Proteolytic activities in cell extracts were assayed using polyprotein as substrate, and infected and uninfected extracts produced qualitatively dissimilar cleavages...|$|E

The nucleotide sequence of the 733 bp cDNA insert includes a 15 bp 5 '-untranslated region, an open reading frame of 477 bp corresponding to 159 amino acids (Mr = 17, 373 D), and a 223 bp 3 '-untranslated region. The identity of the clone was confirmed by in vitro translation of hybrid-selected mRNA or an RNA transcript synthesized from the cDNA. The in vitro synthesized C protein has a slightly greater mobility on SDS-polyacrylamide gels, indicating that the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>product</b> is post-translationally modified.

We present a 35 -year-old female patient with secondary amenorrhea, mild obesity, hirsutism, headache and blurred vision. Hormonal evaluation revealed an extreme hyperprolactinemia (PRL = 10 [*] 610 [*]mIU/L) almost exclusively due to macroprolactin isoform (MPRL = 10 [*] 107 [*]mIU/L; recovery after PEG precipitation 4. 7 %) and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism.

The significant decrease in MPRL levels and tumor volume in response to dopamine agonist therapy is suggestive for the tumoral origin of this isoform. Conclusions.

Ten subjects diagnosed with social phobia were treated with Cognitive-Behavioral Group Therapy, an intervention shown in numerous studies to be highly effective in the treatment of this disorder. Throughout the course of therapy, each subjects 2 ̆ 7 functioning was repeatedly assessed across several cognitive domains, including anticipatory and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> cognitive <b>products,</b> cognitive propositions, and cognitive operations. Cognitive theory predicts an orderly sequence of therapeutic change across these domains. <b>In</b> <b>vivo</b> cognitive <b>products</b> are thought to be the first domain that will evidence positive change, followed by changes in cognitive propositions.

Evidence was found which supported the hypotheses that <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> cognitive <b>products</b> change first, while anticipatory cognitive products change last. However, measures of cognitive propositions evidenced changes earlier than predicted. Due to difficulties with a sequence effect, data relating to cognitive operations generally failed to follow a predictable pattern. The failure of the present study to fully support the cognitive model is attributable to at least three possible sources; (1) insufficient frequency of measurement, (2) insufficient sensitivity of measurement, and/or (3) shortcomings in the cognitive theory.

Translation of goitrous polysomal Tg mRNA resulted, after immunoprecipitation with polyclonal rabbit antigoat Tg antibodies, in a single 35, 000 mol wt (Mr) Tg fragment. To characterize the Tg antigens produced in vivo, thyroid hormone release by the goiter was suppressed by injecting T 4 sc in newborn goitrous goats. Immunohistochemical studies showed the presence of Tg antigens almost solely in the colloidal lumen. Electrophoresis of the reduced thyroid proteins demonstrated the presence of two Tg fragments with Mr of 40, 000 and 32, 000, respectively; the latter is probably a breakdown {{product of the}} 40, 000 Mr fragment.

The dark conversion at 2 ° was complete in 6 to 10 min in the various plants. The time course of the dark reaction was followed at 690 nm near the maximum of the difference spectrum for the conversion. There was a constant relationship between the initial amount of chlorophyllide 678 and the final amount of chlorophyllide 684. The rates of the dark reaction at 2 ° varied 3 -fold among the plants treated. The reaction was not first order. At 25 ° the reaction followed at 690 nm was complete in 20 to 60 sec.

40|$|Quality by Design (QbD) {{principles}} {{has been}} applied to the development of two liposomal formulations, containing a hydrophilic small molecule therapeutic (Tenofovir) and a protein therapeutic (superoxide dismutase). The goal of the research is to provide critical information on 1) how to reduce the preparation variability in liposome formulations, and 2) how to increase drug encapsulation inside liposomes to reduce manufacturing cost. ^ Most notably, an improved liposome preparation method was developed which increased the encapsulation efficiency of hydrophilic molecules. In particular, this method allows for very high encapsulation efficiency. For example, encapsulation efficiencies of up to 50 % have been achieved, whereas previously only 20 % or less have been reported. ^ Another significant outcome from this research is a first principle mathematical model to predict the encapsulation efficiency of hydrophilic drugs in unilamellar liposomes. This mathematical model will be useful in: formulation development to rapidly achieve optimized formulations; comparison of drug encapsulation efficiencies of liposomes prepared using different methods; and assisting in the development of suitable process analytical technologies to achieve real-time monitoring and control of drug encapsulation during manufacturing. ^ A novel two-stage reverse dialysis in vitro release testing method has also been developed for passively targeted liposomes, which uses the first stage to mimic the circulation of liposomes in the body and the second stage to imitate the drug release process at the target. The developed in vitro release testing method can be used to distinguish formulations with varied compositions for quality control testing purposes. This developed method may pave the way to the development of more biorelevant quality control testing methods for liposomal drug products in the future. ^ The QbD case studies performed in this research are examples of how this approach can be used to obtain design space for liposome products to achieve the desired <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>product</b> performance criteria. From an industrial perspective, this study provides an in-depth understanding of the parameters (risks) involved in liposome formulation and processing. From a regulatory perspective, the development of QbD principles for liposomal drug products will facilitate their regulation assuring safety and efficacy of these complex delivery systems. ...|$|E
40|$|Two {{species of}} Pseudomonas capable of {{utilizing}} nitroglycerin (NG) as a sole nitrogen source were isolated from NG-contaminated soil and identified as Pseudomonas putida II-B and P. fluorescens I-C. While 9 of 13 laboratory bacterial strains that presumably had no previous exposure to NG could degrade low concentrations of NG (0. 44 mM), the natural isolates tolerated concentrations of NG that were toxic {{to the lab}} strains (1. 76 mM and higher). Whole-cell studies revealed that the two natural isolates produced different mixtures of the isomers of dinitroglycerol (DNG) and mononitroglycerol (MNG). A monomeric, flavin mononucleotide-containing NG reductase was purified from each natural isolate. These enzymes catalyzed the NADPH-dependent denitration of NG, yielding nitrite. Apparent kinetic constants were determined for both reductases. The P. putida enzyme had a Km for NG of 52 +/- 4 microM, a Km for NADPH of 28 +/- 2 microM, and a Vmax of 124 +/- 6 microM x min(- 1), while the P. fluorescens enzyme had a Km for NG of 110 +/- 10 microM, a Km for NADPH of 5 +/- 1 microM, and a Vmax of 110 +/- 11 microM x min(- 1). Anaerobic titration experiments confirmed the stoichiometry of NADPH consumption, changes in flavin oxidation state, and multiple steps of nitrite removal from NG. The products formed during time-dependent denitration reactions were consistent with a single enzyme being responsible for the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>product</b> distributions. Simulation of the product formation kinetics by numerical integration showed that the P. putida enzyme produced an approximately 2 -fold molar excess of 1, 2 -DNG relative to 1, 3 -DNG. This result could be fortuitous or could possibly be consistent with a random removal of the first nitro group from either the terminal (C- 1 and C- 3) positions or middle (C- 2) position. However, during the denitration of 1, 2 -DNG, a 1. 3 -fold selectivity for the C- 1 nitro group was determined. Comparable simulations of the product distributions from the P. fluorescens enzyme showed that NG was denitrated with a 4. 6 -fold selectivity for the C- 2 position. Furthermore, a 2. 4 -fold selectivity for removal of the nitro group from the C- 2 position of 1, 2 -DNG was also determined. The MNG isomers were not effectively denitrated by either purified enzyme, which suggests a reason why NG {{could not be used}} as a sole carbon source by the isolated organisms...|$|E

Transformation with sugE reversed the mutant phenotype. In wild type K. pneumoniae, transformation with sugE accelerated the rate of nitrogenase biogenesis after nif derepression. In E. coli, transformation with sugE enabled bacteriophage T 4 growth in a groEL mutant. A continuous 178 codon open reading frame (ORF) in sugE encloses another, in-frame, 105 codon ORF similar to a predicted ORF in Proteus vulgaris. <b>In</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>products</b> of both sugE ORFs were observed in transformants expressing {{the gene from a}} T 7 promoter. In non-transformed cells, a typical sigma 70 -dependent promoter found upstream of the larger ORF directs sugE transcription during growth at 30 degrees C. At elevated temperatures or in stationary phase cells, another promoter, found within the coding sequence upstream of the smaller ORF, is activated independently of sigma 32. The results suggest that sugE encodes a chaperonin-related system whose composition might vary with temperature and growth phase...|$|R
40|$|Subcellular {{fractions}} from pea (Pisum sativum L.) roots {{have been}} prepared by differential centrifugation techniques. Greater than 50 % of the recovered plastids can be isolated by centrifugation at 500 g for 5 minutes. Plastids of this fraction are largely free from mitochondrial and microsomal contamination as judged by marker enzyme analysis. De novo fatty acid biosynthesis in pea roots occurs in the plastids. Isolated pea root plastids are capable of fatty acid synthesis from acetate at rates up to 4. 3 nanomoles per hour per milligram protein. ATP, bicarbonate, and either Mg 2 + or Mn 2 + are all absolutely required for activity. Coenzyme A at 0. 5 millimolar improved activity by 60 %. Reduced nucleotides were not essential but activity was greatest {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 millimolar of both NADH and NADPH. The addition of 0. 5 millimolar glycerol- 3 -phosphate increased activity by 25 %. The in vitro and <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>products</b> of fatty acid synthesis from acetate were primarily palmitate, stearate, and oleate, the proportions of which were dependent on experimental treatments. Fatty acids synthesized by pea root plastids were recovered in primarily phosphatidic acid and diacylglycerol or as water soluble derivatives and the free acids. Lesser amounts were found in phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and monogalactosyldiacylglycerol...|$|R

40|$|Background: Phospholipases D (PLD) {{are major}} {{components}} of signalling pathways in plant responses to some stresses and hormones. The product of PLD activity is phosphatidic acid (PA). PAs with different acyl chains {{do not have}} the same protein targets, so to understand the signalling role of PLD it is essential to analyze the composition of its PA products in the presence and absence of an elicitor. Methodology/Principal findings: Potential PLD substrates and products were studied in Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cells treated with or without the hormone salicylic acid (SA). As PA can be produced by enzymes other than PLD, we analyzed phosphatidylbutanol (PBut), which is specifically produced by PLD in the presence of n-butanol. The acyl chain compositions of PBut and the major glycerophospholipids were determined by multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) mass spectrometry. PBut profiles of untreated cells or cells treated with SA show an over-representation of 160 / 18 : 2 - and 16 : 0 / 18 : 3 -species compared to those of phosphatidylcholine and phosphatidylethanolamine either from bulk lipid extracts or from purified membrane fractions. When microsomal PLDs were used in in vitro assays, the resulting PBut profile matched exactly that of the substrate provided. Therefore there is a mismatch between the acyl chain compositions of putative substrates and the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> <b>products</b> of PLDs that is unlikely to reflect any selectivity of PLDs for the acyl chains of substrates. Conclusions: MRM mass spectrometry is a reliable technique to analyze PLD products. Our results suggest that PLD actio...|$|R

Elimination of the amino acid residues {{that are responsible}} for immunogenicity while don’t affect the bioactivity of streptokinase is worthy. Recently, we modified the streptokinase through the elimination of 42 amino acids from its’ C-terminal and assessed its bioactivity in vitro. In this study, bioactivity of the mutated-streptokinase determined and compared with those of commercially available streptokinase (Heberkinase) in rabbits with induced blood clot.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of stained cytosolic proteins, <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> 80 S ribosome translation products and {{in vitro translation}} products of poly(A) + RNA from three species of Acetabularia was performed after characterization of their molecular weights and isoelectric points via two−dimensional electrophoresis. A total of 803 stained proteins, and 121 <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> and 77 <b>in</b> vitro translation products, representing the most abundant proteins in each category, were analysed. In interspecies comparisons, approximately 10 % of the stained proteins were common to all three species and more than 50 % {{were found to be}} species−specific. Approximately 25 % of the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> translation <b>products</b> were common to all three species and more than 30 % were found to be species−specific.

Even though the analysis was limited to the most abundant proteins detected by each of the three methods and to one stage of development, the results suggest that the translation of some proteins is not regulated, that the <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> translation of others, whose mRNA is present and translated in vitro, is turned off while the translation <b>in</b> <b>vivo</b> of others is enhanced relative to the total.
