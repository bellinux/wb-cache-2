5|$|Mariners {{have a way}} {{to safely}} {{navigate}} around tropical cyclones. They split tropical cyclones in two, based on their direction of motion, and maneuver to avoid the right segment of the cyclone in the Northern Hemisphere (the left in the Southern Hemisphere). Sailors term the right side the <b>dangerous</b> <b>semicircle</b> since the heaviest rain and strongest winds and seas were located in this half of the storm, as the cyclone's translation speed and its rotational wind are additive. The other half of the tropical cyclone is called the navigable semicircle since weather conditions are lessened (subtractive) in this portion of the storm (but are still potentially quite hazardous). The rules of thumb for ship travel when a tropical cyclone is in their vicinity are to avoid them if at all possible and do not cross their forecast path (crossing the T). Those traveling through the <b>dangerous</b> <b>semicircle</b> are advised to keep to the true wind on the starboard bow and make as much headway as possible. Ships moving through the navigable semicircle are advised to keep the true wind on the starboard quarter while making as much headway as possible.|$|E

40|$|Typhoon 9119 caused damage {{almost all}} over the islands Japan. The typhoon was {{characterized}} by its low atmospheric pressure of the center on landing (940 hPa), high speed (55 km/h) and high maximum velosity which broke past records held in the 26 meteorological stations in Japan. Due to the strong wind of the typhoon, {{a lot of the}} houses located on the right side to the running direction of the typhoon (<b>dangerous</b> <b>semicircle)</b> were damaged. This paper investigates the characteristics of the house damage and the recovery process in Nagasaki prefecture, by both field survey and questionnaire, and also topographic features and the direction of the house damage, its type of roof tile, environ's topographic features and the direction of the wind. Finally, some suggestions are made for the reduction of house damage due to typhoon...|$|E
