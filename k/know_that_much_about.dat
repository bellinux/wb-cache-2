The results show that both citizens and politicians still perceive voting as the most effective form of political participation. Consumer boycotts and illegal activities, on the other hand, were considered to be least effective. There is a rather large gap between politicians and citizens, however, with regard to the perceived effectiveness of contacting politicians and signing petitions.

40|$|Traditional {{medicine}} {{is still the}} most common primary healthcare used in Tanzania, especially among women. The ethnobotanical studies performed in Tanzania have not explored women’s traditional medicine, with the result that we do not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> it, including if women’s usage of medicinal plants create a threat against the medicinal flora’s biodiversity or not. Field studies consisting of interviews and collections of medicinal plants were carried out in the Dar es Salaam region in Tanzania before identifying the collected specimens by DNA barcoding, literature and morphology in Uppsala, Sweden. The 33 informants belonged to 15 different ethnic groups and 79 % of them had migrated to Dar es Salaam. A total of 249 plant species were mentioned for women’s healthcare and 140 for children’s healthcare. The medicinal plants frequently reported as used for women’s health and childcare during structured interviews and free-listing exercises were Senna occidentalis/ Cassia abbreviata, Zanthoxylum sp., Clausena anisata, Acalypha ornata and Ximenia sp. The most salient uses of medicinal plants by women were during pregnancy, childbirth, menstruation, to induce abortion, and for cleansing infants and treating convulsions in children. Most of the fresh specimens were collected from disturbance vegetation. The informants having most interview answers in common were the market vendors, healers and herbalists and they were the only informants that mentioned species listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species. These results were similar to the outcomes from studies of women’s traditional health care in West Africa. Out of 343 collected specimens, 19 % were identified by DNA barcoding and 33 % by literature sources. Out of 98 voucher samples, 61 % were identified by comparisons of morphology, results from DNA analysis and literature. DNA barcoding was necessary to use as method since most medicines were sold in powdered shape. With more time and experience {{it should be possible to}} chart the majority of the medicinal plants up to species level. A difference between medicinal plant harvest for domestic and commercial use was observed where the commercial harvesting meant a greater threat to the Tanzanian medicinal plant biodiversity due to unsustainable harvesting methods. Previous studies have shown that an increased commercial harvesting and trade of plants often result in a decreased biodiversity. High population growth and quick urbanization mean that domestic harvesting of women’s medicinal plants will not be able to continue as previously and women in Tanzania will be more dependent on commercial trade for their traditional medicine...|$|E

This {{study has}} {{examined}} how parents of children, age 0 - 2, in Karlstad consumes {{for their children}} within three product categories; clothing, food and toys. The aim was to see if having children could be a driving factor to become a more aware consumer. Have the participants consumption behaviour changed after they have had children? Surveys and focus groups have been completed in four open preschools in Karlstad municipality to collect data. As a theoretical framework has ecological modernization, political consumption and weak and strong sustainable consumption been used. Within the three product categories {{it is possible to}} see some differences. The survey result say that respondents shop for clothes according to need, but the focus groups talk about that they shop because it is fun, a hobby. It has become more important for the parents to buy organic food, mostly to the child. However, it is not a strong position because most respondents choose to buy conventional produced products if they don’t have an ecological alternative in the store. Because most of the respondents children where still small they hadn’t purchased that many toys yet. They express, however, that it is a difficult category to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> and they usually goes on what the child shows interest for. Overall, it is possible to see some changes in behaviour, but participants lack a comprehensive view of the consumption chain. They don’t reflect on the level of consumption and so they pursue on the path of weak sustainable consumption where they consumes the same amount but change to more sustainable materials. The lack of overall vision is also evident in that they don’t practice political consumption to any wider extent, they simply don’t see their own impact on the consumption chain. The result also shows that the parents are strongly guided by social norms that sets the rules for what they consider to be their needs. This is a qualitative study and could therefore have gotten a different result in another context. ...|$|E

40|$|From the Introduction: Four years ago, I Was {{doing some}} {{research}} for an article assignment, and happened {{to come across}} a blurb on Elizabeth Blackwell and her struggles to become the country's first female physician. I remember at the time thinking to myself that I couldn't believe that after 40 years on this planet (all of them spent in the United States) that I had never even heard {{the name of a}} woman who had so profoundly changed the course of so many women's lives. I had an appointment shortly thereafter with my own physician, a woman, and I made a special point of asking her if she was aware of Elizabeth Blackwell. She told me <b>that</b> although she <b>knew</b> who she was, she really didn't <b>know</b> all <b>that</b> <b>much</b> <b>about</b> her. Now here was a female doctor, barely 100 years after the death of Blackwell, who had herself attended medical school, and yet hardly knew anything about the woman who had opened the doors of medical college to all those who came after her. I resolved then and there to make it my goal to tell Blackwell's story, and to bring her accomplishments out into the light for all those who have yet to know her. At {{about the same time as}} my fateful doctor's appointment, I'd completed a screenplay in a class I was taking through UCLA Extension on another woman in history who I found equally fuscinating: Diane de Poitiers, the mistress of King Henri II of France, who was 20 years' his senior. I found the process extremely frustrating, challenging and daunting; however, once it was done I also found that I had enjoyed it immensely. I liked trying to tell a story with visual images, but also one that must be told using minimal stage direction, zero-to-little expository writing, mainly through the use of dialogue, and yet engaging enough so that someone (the reader, producer, actor, set designer, composer) can literally "see" the story unfold before them as they read the words on the page. And it must all be done extremely judiciously as the standard page count for a script from a new, unknown writer needs to be no longer than 120 pages. (Industry wisdom dictates that a movie should run: no longer than 120 minutes, or two hours; figuring one written page equals one minute of screen-time, you can therefore calculate the approximate time the movie will run by the script's page count.) It might be helpful here to digress just a bit in terms of my particular goals for this thesis, Which admittedly are somewhat different from most: Although my intention was and is to have this script (my thesis) defended successfully, published, and catalogued in the library at CSUSM, I have never wanted it to end there, for I have high hopes for this project on a commercial level as well; that is, I want to sell this script and have it made into a film. Therefore, my concerns are different than most other students in the Literature & Writing Graduate program at CSUSM in that I want to also create a piece of work that someone will want to buy and invest a lot of time and money in. And so, I'm very self-conscious about not breaking any of the rules of the genre as I am not a Coppola or Spielberg, and therefore have to play by the rules first in order to get invited to the party.

6000|$|Feeding {{the birds}} and keeping the cage always sweet and clean would occupy most, if not the whole of my time. But would <b>that</b> be too <b>much</b> to give if it made me {{tranquil}} in my own mind? For {{it must be noted}} that I have done all this, mentally and on paper, for my own satisfaction rather than that of the canaries. Birds are not worth much--to us. Are not five sparrows sold for three farthings? I have even shot many birds and have felt no compunction. True, they perished before their time, but they did not languish, and being dead there was an end of them; but the caged canaries continuing with us, cannot be dismissed from the mind with the same convenient ease. After all, I begin to think that my imaginary reforms, if carried out, would not quite content me. The [...] "compunctious visitings" [...] would continue still. I look out of the window and see a sparrow on a neighbouring tree, loudly chirruping. And as I listen, trying to find comfort by thinking of the perils which do environ him, his careless unconventional sparrow-music resolves itself into articulate speech, interspersed with occasional bursts of derisive laughter. He knows, this fabulous sparrow, what I have been thinking about and have written. [...] "How would you like it," [...] I hear him saying, [...] "O wise man <b>that</b> <b>knows</b> so <b>much</b> <b>about</b> the ways of birds, if you were shut up in a big cage--in Windsor Castle, let us say--with scores of menials to wait on you and anticipate your every want? That is, I must explain, every want compatible with--ahem!--the captive condition. Would you be happy in your confinement, practising with the dumb-bells, riding up and down the floors on a bicycle and gazing at pictures and filigree caskets and big malachite vases and eating dinners of many, many courses? Or would you begin to wish that you might be allowed to live on sixpence a day--and earn it; and even envy the ragged tramp who dines on a handful of half-rotten apples and sleeps in a hay-stack, but is free to come and go, and range the world at will? You have been playing at nature; but Nature mocks you, for your captives thank you not. They would rather go to her without an intermediary, and take a scantier measure of food from her hand, but flavoured as she only can flavour it. Widen your cage, naturalist; replace the little twinkling lustres with sun and moon and milky way; plant forests on the floor, and let there be hills and valleys, rivers and wide spaces; and let the blue pillars of heaven be the wires of your cage, with free entrance to wind and rain; then your little captives will be happy, even happy as I am, in spite of all the perils which do environ me--guns and cats and snares, with wet and fog and hard frosts to come." ...|$|R
