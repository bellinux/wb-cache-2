Regarding the year 2008, in the European area, the Prut River remained a political barrier between two Romanian states, Romania and Moldavian Republic. The trans-frontier cooperation of Euro-regional type represents a modality of vanishing the differences of structural-territorial and economical kind, that derives from the superposition of the eastern extern frontier route of the EU (from 2007) and NATO (from 2004) with Prut River. The Siret-Prut-Nistru Euro-region, created at the initiative of Romania in 2002, “covers ” from the territorial and demographic point of view an important part in the Romanian ex-EU area, making in this way an optimal frame of interconnecting the two territorial state systems, toggled in different macro-territorial structures. The “Siret-Prut-Nistru ” Euro-region can be considerate one with a remarkable functional potential, determined by the common peculiarity that has the human communities from those two associated political areas and of course, the European aspiration of both states...|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to define the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The thesis has been divided into five chapters, which are further subdivided. The reason why I have chosen this topic is quite simple - to analyse {{the current status of}} the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties and {{introduce}} them to wider audience not to be confused anymore with political groups in the European Parliament. In the first chapter the thesis brings a brief definition of the legal constitution of political groups in the European Parliament. For many years there has been confusion between the concept of a <b>European</b> <b>political</b> party and political group, so the thesis defines the political groups and its position in the European Parliament {{in order to create a}} basis for their differentiation from the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The second chapter is devoted to create a definition of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> party and to bring the legal regulation of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. The thesis focuses also on the variability of their legal base in the treaties of the European Union (legal base before the Treaty of Lisbon, legal base in the Treaty establishing a Constitution for Europe and legal base in the Treaty of Lisbon). The third chapter is dedicated to legal issues of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties. Emphasis was put on [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Almost {{twenty years}} after their first legal {{recognition}} by the Treaty of Maastricht, the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties have not induced, as some political elites expected it, a "new era of European politics". The 2009 European elections or the current European debates show that these parties remain marginal actors of the European decision-making process. In this context, this article approaches two questions related to the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties: first: why have these parties formed and developed {{if they do not}} play the role classic political parties do; and second: why aren’t they playing this role? The author argues in this article that the answer to the first question {{is to be found in}} the spillover process that has been caused by the growth of European Parliament’s competencies and by the debate on EU’s democratic deficit. As for the second question, both the structure of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> system and the internal heterogeneity of the <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties limit their capacity to develop. Thus, it seems that EU’s founding compromise between supranational and intergovernmental positions is the most appropriate explication for <b>European</b> <b>political</b> parties’ capacity/incapacity to establish themselves as “key” European actors...|$|R

40|$|In {{the article}} the author {{analyzes}} {{the parameters of}} <b>European</b> <b>political</b> consciousness, i. e. European research field of political consciousness in qualitative and quantitative terms, which may be based on different indicators. The issue of emergence and development of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> consciousness becomes topical because firstly, its formation as the subjective dimension of European integration policy is not a spontaneous process and, secondly, European integration is carried out {{not only from the}} top but from the bottom, requiring deliberate interference of the public with the process; the public possesses the formed <b>European</b> <b>political</b> consciousness. Since the latter is a specific mental construct, the author offers to apply the triad «criteria ­ parameters – indicators». The characteristic that makes it possible to evaluate certain processes or phenomena in the system of Europeanness / Europeanism and specifies the quality system of views and opinions, which are realized in European behavior, is considered to be the criterion of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> consciousness. The <b>European</b> <b>political</b> consciousness parameters are seen to include the relevant historical memory, trends of public opinion and awareness regarding the European Union and position of its members in the European integration process, including the assessment of the existence and development of the EU; knowledge and views on the main EU institutions, assessing the importance of the main institutions of the EU and trust in them; a positive vision {{for the future of the}} European Union etc. The author considers the performance and objective characteristics and dimensions, including positive correlation of national and European levels of identity (European identity) and European behavior to be the indicatiors of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> awareness. On the basis of these indicators the control of the condition and trends of <b>European</b> <b>political</b> consciousness development will be carried out...|$|R
