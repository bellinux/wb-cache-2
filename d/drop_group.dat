In Experiment 1, participants learned uncommon English words paired with their definition and were divided into three groups- repeated retrieval, repeated study, and drop. After each correct recall in the <b>drop</b> <b>group</b> the pair of words were removed from future study and retrieval tasks.

Experiment 2 had the same design as the first, but two differences and had the same results as the first experiment. Experiment 3 had similar procedure with Swahili-English word pairs but had a fourth group: repeated elaborations. The results of Experiment 3 showed that long term retention was more effective with repeated retrieval than repeated verbal elaborations. Experiment 4 the subjects were asked to learn word pairs and had different cues for target words or cues that would act as the target word. Results showed that repeated retrieval enhanced long term memory and mnemonics do not stem from elaborations, unless it was for the first recall.

In this study, we evaluated the efficacy {{of a combination of}} sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum eye drops and treatment for obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction as a therapy for late-onset bleb leaks after trabeculectomy with mitomycin C. Methods: This was a retrospective, interventional, nonsimultaneous study of 12 subjects (12 eyes) of mean age of 64. 3 &plusmn; 18. 3 years with OSD and apparent late-onset bleb leaks following trabeculectomy with mitomycin C between 1998 and 2008. We compared patients diagnosed with leakages before July 2005, who had been treated with separate eye drop solutions containing 0. 1 % sodium hyaluronate, 50 % autologous serum, and 0. 3 % ofloxacin (sodium hyaluronate and autologous serum group, n = 7), with patients diagnosed from August 2005 to December 2008, who were treated with a combination of eye drops (0. 1 % sodium hyaluronate, 50 % autologous serum, and 0. 08 % levofloxacin hydrate) and eyelid massage and warm compresses for obstructive meibomian gland dysfunction (combination eye <b>drop</b> <b>group,</b> n = 5).

Methods: A total of 122 cases with acute myocardial infarction (study group) who were admitted in our hospital from January 2012 to December 2014 were selected and retrospectively analyzed. Meanwhile 122 cases with healthy physical examination in our hospital were selected as control group. Patients in study group were performed with PCI, and conventional elbow vein blood was collected for CRP, NT-proBNP, CK-MB, cTnT level determination within 24 h before and after PCI, and then CRP, NT-proBNP, CK-MB, cTnT level changes before and after PCI were analyzed. Results: CRP, NT-proBNP, CK-MB, cTnT levels of patients in study group {{were significantly higher than}} that in control group (P< 0. 05). NT-proBNP, cTnT, CRP, CK-MB levels of patients in study group were significantly reduced after PCI (P< 0. 05). cTnT and NT-proBNP levels of patients in study group presented proportional relations after PCI, NT-proBNP level had a certain relations with myocardial ischemia. There were significant difference in total time and total times of unstable angina pectoris, diabetes, bifurcation lesion,multi-vessel lesions and balloon dilatation between cTnT drop group&cTnT unchanged group and NT-proBNP drop group&NT-proBNP unchanged group after PCI (P< 0. 05). Stent length difference was statistical significant only in cTnT drop group&cTnT unchanged group (P< 0. 05), while difference was not statistical significant in NT-proBNP drop group&NT-proBNP unchanged group. Logistic analysis found that total time and total times of unstable angina pectoris, diabetes, bifurcation lesion, multi-vessel lesions and balloon dilatation were the relevant factors affecting postoperative cTnT and NT-proBNP level changes for patients with acute myocardial infarction, and stent length was the relevant factor affecting cTnT level changes.

40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} the temporal, kinetic, kinematic, electromyographic and energetic aspects of gait in Charcot-Marie-Tooth patients with foot drop and plantar flexion failure. Methods. A sample of 21 patients fulfilling clinical, electrodiagnostic and genetic criteria for Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease {{were evaluated by}} computerized gait analysis system and compared {{to a group of}} matched healthy subjects. Patients were classified as having isolate foot <b>drop</b> (<b>group</b> 1) and association of foot drop and plantar flexion failure (group 2). Results. While it was impossible to detect a reliable gait pattern when the group of patients was considered as a whole and compared to healthy subjects, we observed two distinctive gait patterns when patients were subdivided as group I or 2. Group I showed a gait pattern with some characteristics of the "steppage pattern". The complex motor strategy adopted by this group leads to reduce the swing velocity and to preserve the step length in spite of a high energy consumption. Group 2 displayed a "clumsy pattern" characterized by very slow gait with reduced step length, a broader support area and great reduction in the cadence. This group of patients is characterized by a low energy consumption and greater energy recovery, due above all to the primary deficit and the various compensatory mechanisms. Conclusions. Such between-group differences in gait pattern can be related to both primary motor deficits and secondary compensatory mechanisms. Foot drop and plantar flexion failure affect the overall gait strategy in Charcot-Marie-Tooth patients. (C) 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

In this experimental study, we have applied various culture conditions to differentiate human umbilical cord matrix-derived mesenchymal cells (hUCMs) into IPCs and measured insulin production. Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, we exposed hUCMs cells to pancreatic medium and differentiated them into IPCs in monolayer and suspension cultures. Pancreatic medium consisted of serum-free Dulbecco’s modified eagle’s medium Nutrient mixture F 12 (DMEM/F 12) medium with 17. 5 mM glucose supplemented by 10 mM nicotinamide, 10 nM exendin- 4, 10 nM pentagastrin, 100 pM hepatocyte growth factor, and B- 27 serum-free supplement. After differentiation, insulin content was analyzed by gene expression, immunocytochemistry (IHC) and the chemiluminesence immunoassay (CLIA).

40|$|Abstract Background Prior studies {{demonstrated}} that hesitation-prone persons with Parkinson’s disease (PDs) acutely improve step initiation using a novel self-triggered stimulus that enhances lateral weight shift prior to step onset. PDs showed reduced anticipatory postural adjustment (APA) durations, earlier step onsets, and faster 1 st step speed immediately following stimulus exposure. Objective This {{study investigated the}} effects of long-term stimulus exposure. Methods Two groups of hesitation-prone subjects with Parkinson’s disease (PD) participated in a 6 -week step-initiation training program involving one of two stimulus conditions: 1) Drop. The stance-side support surface was lowered quickly (1. 5 cm); 2) Vibration. A short vibration (100 ms) was applied beneath the stance-side support surface. Stimuli were self-triggered by a 5 % reduction in vertical force under the stance foot during the APA. Testing was at baseline, immediately post-training, and 6 weeks post-training. Measurements included timing and magnitude of ground reaction forces, and step speed and length. Results Both groups improved their APA force modulation after training. Contrary to previous results, neither group showed reduced APA durations or earlier step onset times. The vibration group showed 55 % increase in step speed and a 39 % increase in step length which were retained 6 weeks post-training. The <b>drop</b> <b>group</b> showed no stepping-performance improvements. Conclusions The acute sensitivity to the quickness-enhancing effects of stimulus exposure demonstrated in previous studies was supplanted by improved force modulation following prolonged stimulus exposure. The results suggest a potential approach to reduce the severity of start hesitation in PDs, but further study is needed to {{understand the relationship between}} short- and long-term effects of stimulus exposure. </p...|$|E
