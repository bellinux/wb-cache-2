5|$|Considered {{to be one}} of {{the biggest}} and most ambitious film {{projects}} ever undertaken, with an overall budget of $281 million (some sources say $310-$330 million), the entire project took eight years, with the filming for all three films done simultaneously and entirely in New Zealand, Jackson's native country. Each film in the series also <b>had</b> <b>special</b> extended editions released on DVD a year after their respective theatrical releases. While the films follow the book's general storyline, they do omit some of the novel's plot elements and include some additions to and deviations from the source material.|$|E

Argentina supported all the international positions of the US, and sent forces to the Gulf War, and the peace keeping efforts after the Kosovo War. The country was accepted as a Major non-NATO ally, but not as a full member.|$|E
5|$|Slaves <b>had</b> <b>special</b> sexual {{restrictions}} and obligations. For example, a slave could not engage free boys in pederastic relationships ("A slave {{shall not be}} the lover of a free boy nor follow after him, or else he shall receive fifty blows of the public lash."), and they were forbidden from the palaestrae ("A slave shall not take exercise or anoint himself in the wrestling-schools."). Both laws are attributed to Solon. Fathers wanting to protect their sons from unwanted advances provided them with a slave guard, called a paidagogos, to escort the boy in his travels.|$|E

5|$|Biblical Hebrew had {{a typical}} Semitic {{morphology}} with nonconcatenative morphology, arranging Semitic roots into patterns to form words. Biblical Hebrew distinguished two genders (masculine, feminine), three numbers (singular, plural, and uncommonly, dual). Verbs were marked for voice and mood, {{and had two}} conjugations which may have indicated aspect and/or tense (a matter of debate). The tense or aspect of verbs was also influenced by the conjugation , in the so-called waw-consecutive construction. Default word order was verb–subject–object, and verbs inflected for the number, gender, and person of their subject. Pronominal suffixes could be appended to verbs (to indicate object) or nouns (to indicate possession), and nouns <b>had</b> <b>special</b> construct states for use in possessive constructions.|$|E
5|$|During the 9th century, the Tang seaport at Guangzhou {{had a large}} Muslim population. During the Song dynasty the {{importance}} of the latter seaport declined as the ports of Quanzhou and Fuzhou in Fujian province eclipsed it. This was followed by a decline of Middle Eastern sea merchants in China and an increasing amount of Chinese ship owners engaging in maritime trade. However, Middle Eastern merchants and other foreigners were not entirely absent, and some even gained administrative posts. For example, the Muslim Pu Shougeng—of either Persian or Arab descent—served as the Commissioner of Merchant Shipping for Quanzhou between the years 1250 and 1275. There was also the Arab astronomer Ma Yize (910–1005), who became the chief astronomer of the Song court under Taizu. Aside from these elites, Chinese seaports were filled with resident Arabs, Persians, and Koreans who <b>had</b> <b>special</b> enclaves designated for each of them.|$|E
5|$|John, Duke of Berry (1340–1416) was Charles VI's {{uncle and}} a {{powerful}} figure in the kingdom, {{as well as the}} most famous and extravagant collector and commissioner of art of his day. He is still best known for commissioning the Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry, the famous International Gothic illuminated manuscript, and also commissioned the Holy Thorn Reliquary, now in the British Museum. The young king Charles had been forced to remove his uncle from governorships after the latter's rapacious conduct had led to unrest, and the meeting in 1391 marked their reconciliation after a period of bad relations. Lavish gifts among the Valois court circle were routine, and on this occasion Berry <b>had</b> <b>special</b> reason to be generous.|$|E

5|$|Physical {{exercises}} {{were popular}} {{with men and}} wrestling was an important male preoccupation for sport and entertainment. Even women wrestlers are mentioned in records. Gymnasiums have been discovered inside royal quarters and records speak of regular physical training for commanders and their armies during peace time. Royal palaces and market places <b>had</b> <b>special</b> arenas where royalty and common people alike amused themselves by watching matches such as cock fights, ram fights and wrestling between women. Excavations within the Vijayanagara city limits have revealed the existence of various types of community-based activities {{in the form of}} engravings on boulders, rock platforms and temple floors, implying these were places of casual social interaction. Some of these games are in use today and others are yet to be identified.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxon kingdoms were {{hierarchical}} societies, each {{based on}} ties of allegiance between powerful lords and their immediate followers. At {{the top of}} the social structure was the king, who stood above many of the normal processes of Anglo-Saxon life and whose household <b>had</b> <b>special</b> privileges and protection. Beneath the king were thegns, nobles, the more powerful of which maintained their own courts and were termed ealdormen. The relationship between kings and their nobles was bound up with military symbolism and the ritual exchange of weapons and armour. Freemen, called churls, formed the next level of society, often holding land in their own right or controlling businesses in the towns. Geburs, peasants who worked land belonging to a thegn, formed a lower class still. The very lowest class were slaves, who could be bought and sold and who held only minimal rights.|$|E
5|$|The basic prototypes of the M32 {{were created}} by Lima Locomotive on January 11, 1943. The prototypes were labeled T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and T5E4. These designs competed against the T2 and T7 designs, which both had a turret mounted boom, at the Aberdeen Proving Grounds. The T5 was {{declared}} superior to the T2 and T7 designs after several weeks of testing. The four prototypes were sent to Aberdeen (T5 and T5E1), Camp Hood (T5E2), and Camp Seely (T5E4). However, during the testing the T5E3's engine was damaged, so it could not go through further testing. OCM 21553 standardized the designs of the T5, T5E1, T5E2, T5E3, and the T5E4 as the M32, M32E1, M32E2, M32E3, and the M32E4 in June 1943. This protocol also terminated the T7 project. However, the M32E4 did not enter production. Many M32s were converted into M34 Prime Movers, which were used to tow heavy artillery. The M34s were unarmed, and <b>had</b> <b>special</b> equipment to pull heavy artillery.|$|E

5|$|In 1161 Chesney became {{embroiled in}} a dispute with St Albans Abbey, {{resulting}} from his efforts to enforce his right, as bishop, to supervise religious houses within his diocese. Although Pope Alexander III sent a papal bull to England ordering the case to be heard {{by a panel of}} two bishops, King Henry II felt that the papal order infringed on his royal rights and had the case decided at the royal court instead. In 1155–1156 St Albans had secured papal privileges from the English Pope Adrian IV, who had previously been a monk there, that exempted the abbey from diocesan supervision, and it was these privileges that Chesney challenged. Chesney secured not only the papal bull but a royal commission to investigate the rights of the abbey {{as they were in the}} time of King Henry I. The final disposition of the case took place in 1163, at a royal council at Westminster, where the abbey produced both the papal privileges and a forged charter of Offa of Mercia in support of their case. As Chesney was unable to produce any documents in support of his own position, the king and council told the bishop that they favoured the abbey's cause. The king also ruled that the abbey was a royal proprietary church, and thus <b>had</b> <b>special</b> exemptions. In the end, a compromise was reached, whereby the abbey compensated the bishopric with some land in return for the bishop renouncing his claims.|$|E
5|$|The Gamezebo {{reviewer}} <b>had</b> <b>special</b> {{praise for}} the game's sound design {{and how it was}} used to clue the player into puzzle solutions. TouchArcade commended how the game's sparse story unfolded by watching the assassination targets go about their time at the compound. The reviewer also noted that his suspension of disbelief was broken when characters would eventually return to partying after reacting to a gunshot, but suggested that the game's Easter eggs redeemed its psychopathic qualities. Pocket Gamer wrote that the game did not reach the heights of the series' situational humor in hiding bodies stealthily. Other criticism included Gamezebo, which blamed the game's core multiplier ability for breaking the balance of the game. TouchArcade thought that the game played better on the tablet iPad than on the smaller iPhone, and praised the feature that synced game progress, since Apple's iCloud service was known for its struggle to successfully implement the same feature. Despite Square Enix Montreal being best known for its Go series, Hitman: Sniper was the studio's biggest revenue generator. As its most lucrative title, the game helped to fund the development of the Go series.|$|E
5|$|The LRDG {{vehicles}} were mainly two wheel drive, chosen {{because they were}} lighter and used less fuel than four wheel drive. They were stripped of all non-essentials, including doors, windscreens and roofs. They were fitted with a bigger radiator, a condenser system, built up leaf springs for the harsh terrain, wide, low pressure desert tyres, sand mats and channels, plus map containers and a sun compass devised by Bagnold. Wireless trucks <b>had</b> <b>special</b> compartments built into the bodywork to house wireless equipment. Initially the LRDG patrols were equipped with one Canadian Military Pattern (CMP) Ford 15 cwt F15 truck for the commander, {{while the rest of}} the patrol used up to 10 Chevrolet 30 cwt wide-body (WB) trucks. From March 1941 the 30 cwt Chevrolets were replaced by the CMP Ford 30 cwt F30, although in some ways this was a retrograde step; because they were four wheel drive and heavier than the Chevrolets, they used twice as much fuel, which in turn reduced the range of a patrol. From March 1942 the Fords were progressively replaced by 200 Canadian Chevrolet 1533 X2 30 cwts, which had been specially ordered for the LRDG. From July 1942 Willys Jeeps began to be issued for the patrol commander and patrol sergeant.|$|E
