25|$|Decades {{into the}} desktop {{publishing}} revolution, few typographers with metal foundry type experience are still working, and few digital typefaces are optimized specifically for different sizes, so {{the misuse of}} the term <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> as a synonym for ornamental type has become widespread; properly speaking, ornamental typefaces are a subcategory of display typefaces. At the same time, with new printing techniques, typefaces have largely replaced hand-lettering for very large signs and notices that would once have been painted or carved by hand.|$|E
25|$|In {{the metal}} type era, type-founding {{companies}} often would offer pre-formed illustrations as fonts showing objects and designs {{likely to be}} useful for printing and advertisements, the equivalent of modern clip art and stock photographs. As examples, the American Type Founders specimen of 1897 offered designs including baseball players, animals, Christmas wreaths, designs for cheques, and emblems such as state seals for government printing. The practice has declined as printing custom illustrations and colour printing using processes such as lithography has become cheaper, although illustration typefaces are still sold by some companies. See above for the historical definition of <b>display</b> <b>typeface.</b>|$|E
500|$|Marketed by Monotype as {{a design}} of [...] "classic {{simplicity}} and real beauty", {{it was intended}} as a <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{that could be used for}} posters and advertisements, as well as for the text of documents that need to be clearly legible at small sizes or from a distance, such as book blurbs, timetables and price lists. Designed before setting documents entirely in sans-serif text was common, its standard weight is noticeably bolder than most modern body text fonts.|$|E
25|$|In some {{inscriptions}} and <b>display</b> <b>typefaces,</b> Ö may {{be represented}} as an O {{with a small}} letter E inside.|$|R
50|$|<b>Display</b> <b>typefaces</b> {{intended}} to be used at large sizes, such as on signs and posters, vary in x-height. Many have high x-heights to be read clearly from a distance. This, though, is not universally the case: some <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> such as Cochin intended for publicity uses have low x-heights, {{to give them a}} more elegant, delicate appearance. Many sans-serif designs that are intended for display text have high x-heights, such as Helvetica or, more extremely, Impact.|$|R
50|$|Especially on {{the front}} page of {{newspapers}} and on magazine covers, headlines often are set in larger <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> to attract attention, and are placed near the masthead.|$|R
5000|$|Auriol is a <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{created by}} George Auriol in 1901 for the G. Peignot et Fils foundry in Paris.|$|E
5000|$|Westminster is a {{printing}} and <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{inspired by the}} machine-readable numbers printed on cheques and designed by Leo Maggs.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>display</b> <b>typeface,</b> {{it is more}} {{suitable}} for titles than large streams of text due to its characters complicated shapes.|$|E
25|$|Ornamental (also {{known as}} novelty or {{sometimes}} <b>display)</b> <b>typefaces</b> {{are used to}} decorate a page. Historically complex interlocking patterns known as arabesques were common in fine printing, as were floral borders known as fleurons evoking hand-drawn manuscripts.|$|R
50|$|Blambot is {{the name}} of an online type foundry and is the alias of {{freeware}} and shareware computer font designer Nate Piekos. Blambot specializes in script and <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> for use as lettering in both print and online comics.|$|R
5000|$|A pangram (παν γράμμα, pan gramma, [...] "every letter") or holoalphabetic {{sentence}} is a sentence using every letter {{of a given}} alphabet at least once. Pangrams {{have been used to}} <b>display</b> <b>typefaces,</b> test equipment, and develop skills in handwriting, calligraphy, and keyboarding.|$|R
50|$|A <b>display</b> <b>{{typeface}}</b> is a typeface that {{is intended}} for use at large sizes for headings, rather than for extended passages of body text.|$|E
50|$|Belwe Roman is a <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{designed}} by Georg Belwe in 1907. The type has Old Style qualities, but short ascenders and very short descenders {{as well as}} calligraphic and Fraktur influences.|$|E
50|$|Gabriola is a <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{designed}} by John Hudson for the Microsoft Corporation. It {{is named after}} Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada. Versions of Gabriola {{have been used in}} Windows 7, Windows 8 and Microsoft Office 2010.|$|E
50|$|A more prosaic {{genre of}} <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> is those {{intended}} for signage, such as Johnston, Highway Gothic, Transport and Clearview. These often have adaptations to increase legibility and make letters more distinct from each other. For example, Johnston and Transport have a curl on the lower-case ‘L’ to {{distinguish it from}} an upper-case ‘i'.|$|R
50|$|Under Twombly's art direction, fonts such as Ponderosa, Pepperwood, Zebrawood, and Rosewood, {{were part}} of an Adobe project to revive American <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> in wood type from the 1880s. After this series, she went on to design two more typefaces for Adobe: Nueva, an {{original}} design, and Chapparral, which references nineteenth-century slab serif forms and sixteenth-century roman book hand, a calligraphic form. She designed Chapparral in collaboration with calligrapher Linnea Lundquist.|$|R

50|$|In 2009 Pascal Zoghbi {{designed}} FF Seria Arabic - {{an improved}} version of Sada - {{to be the}} first Arabic typeface in the FontFont library, The Regular and Bold are text typefaces, the Light is both display and text type, while the Black is purely a <b>display</b> <b>typeface.</b>|$|E
50|$|Strizver was the Director of Typeface Development for International Typeface Corporation (ITC), {{where she}} {{developed}} more than 300 text and <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> with such respected and world-renowned type designers as Sumner Stone, Erik Spiekermann, Jill Bell, Jim Parkinson, Tim Donaldson, {{and the late}} Phill Grimshaw. Prior to ITC, she was Creative & Production Director of Upper & lowercase (U&lc), the award-winning international journal for typography and typographic design. She worked with such legendary type icons as Ed Benguiat, Aaron Burns and Herb Lubalin.|$|R
50|$|For {{the first}} centuries of {{printing}}, display type did not exist, with printing principally used for body text, with occasional larger titles and ornamented letters. Large size-typefaces were first used for purposes such as book titles and then developed as printing {{began to be}} used for posters and signs. Historian James Mosley has written that “big types had been cast in sand, using wooden patterns, for some centuries 1750 but there is evidence that English typefounders only began to make big letters for posters and other commercial printing towards 1770, when Thomas Cottrell made his 'Proscription or Posting letter of great bulk and dimension' and William Caslon II cast his 'Patagonian' or 'Proscription letters’.” The arrival of the poster spurred new designs of printed letter, such as sans-serifs (already used in custom lettering but effectively unused in printing before the 1830s), “fat face” Didone typefaces, and slab serifs, as well as the pre-existing blackletter styles already used both in printing and in signpainting. Many nineteenth-century <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> were extremely, aggressively bold and condensed in order to attract attention. Equally, some <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> such as Cochin and Koch-Antiqua have a particularly delicate build with a low x-height, and this style was very popular around the start of the twentieth century.|$|R
50|$|<b>Display</b> <b>typefaces</b> {{will often}} have more {{eccentric}} and variable designs than the simple, relatively restrained typefaces generally used for body text. They may {{take inspiration from}} other genres of lettering, such as handpainted signs, calligraphy or an aesthetic appropriate to their use, perhaps ornamented, exotic, abstracted or drawn {{in the style of}} a different writing system. Several genres of font are particularly associated with display setting, such as slab serif, script font, reverse-contrast {{and to a lesser extent}} sans serif, although all of these may also used at small print sizes.|$|R
5000|$|Bukra is an Arabic variant {{designed}} by Pascal Zoghbi. It consists of Bukra Extra Bold, {{which was used}} as an Arabic <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> for Ibn Battuta Mall in Dubai as a complement for Futura Extra Bold. The design was based on Kufi script, but using shortened descenders. The name Bukra itself is a phonetic representation of one way to express [...] "tomorrow" [...] or [...] "in the future" [...] in some Arabic cultures.|$|E
50|$|Lo-Type (sometimes Lo-type, or Lo Type; {{originally}} Lo-Schrift) is a <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{originally designed}} by Louis Oppenheim. Oppenheim named the font using his own initials which he {{also used to}} sign his work. Oppenheim designed the avant-garde Lo-Type for Berthold during 1911-1914 {{under the influence of}} the emerging modernist era, thus participating in its outburst. In 1980, Oppenheim's Lo-Type was reintroduced with additional weights for phototypesetting by Erik Spiekermann and is still in use today.|$|E
5000|$|Delphian is an all-caps <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{created by}} R. Hunter Middleton in 1928 and {{published}} in metal by Ludlow. A digital version was issued by Monotype. [...] Delphian has a modern, yet classic style [...] and is notable for having no lower-case characters. [...] One website commented on Middleton's font, [...] "His tour de force, Delphian Open Title, invokes that rare intellectual response, admiration." [...] It is seldom used today, except to evoke an art deco aura.|$|E
50|$|In typography, the Thibaudeau Classification {{is a way}} {{to group}} typefaces into four general families, {{according}} to shape and serif character. Invented in 1921 by the French typographer Francis Thibaudeau, it was expanded by Maximilien Vox in 1954, and again in 1962 by Association Typographique Internationale (ATypI) into the VOX-ATypI classification of 11 families. The Thibaudeau system is nevertheless still beneficial in that it is simple to comprehend. Thibaudeau later supplemented the classification by adding the category of the Écritures (for the scripts) and the Fantaisies (for the advertising or <b>display</b> <b>typefaces).</b>|$|R
40|$|It is {{proposed}} that the appropriateness of a typeface is partly determined by {{the extent to which}} it shares multi-modal features with the concept that it represents. Exploring a number of professions as the concepts to be represented, we offer evidence to support this hypothesis. We demonstrate that n on-specialists discriminate a variety of <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> and professions in terms of a common set of multimodal features. In addition, on the basis of the extent to which each typeface shares multi-modal features with each profession, we successfully predict the judged appropriateness of various typefaces to represent each profession...|$|R
5000|$|By 1903 Old Style Antique {{was sold}} by American Type Founders {{under the new}} name of Bookman Old Style, with an added 'italic'. ATF did not offer a normal titalic, instead {{featuring}} an oblique, or [...] "sloped roman", in which the letters are simply slanted. Serif typefaces which use an oblique are now quite rare, but the style was relatively common for <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> in the {{nineteenth and early twentieth}} centuries. It was sold with some swash capitals and other letters. Although one critic described its swash letters in 1913 as [...] "ridiculous", they would become a popular feature of revivals and derivatives.|$|R
5000|$|Marketed by Monotype as {{a design}} of [...] "classic {{simplicity}} and real beauty", {{it was intended}} as a <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> {{that could be used for}} posters and advertisements, as well as for the text of documents that need to be clearly legible at small sizes or from a distance, such as book blurbs, timetables and price lists.

50|$|During {{her career}} Colwell worked in advertising, {{and she was}} known for her hand-lettered {{newspaper}} advertisements. In 1909 she published a book of poetry, Songs and Sonnets, which she designed and illustrated herself; she published other such books during her career. 1910 saw {{the publication of the}} volume On the Making of Wood-Block-Color Prints. For American Type Founders Colwell designed the 1916 <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> Colwell Handletter and its italic. A 1947 exhibition on the history of type design in American noted her place as the only American female type designer known at that time.|$|E
50|$|Colonna is {{an inline}} serif <b>display</b> <b>typeface</b> created by Monotype in 1926.A roman typeface, Colonna comes {{with some very}} elegant letterforms, based on artwork {{obtained}} by Stanley Morison during 1926 {{as part of a}} program to increase the range of display faces in the Monotype library. The letters of the Colonna font have an inscriptional feel about them, figures are non-ranging. Originally developed as an advertising face, Colonna is at its best when used in large sizes. Like many Monotype fonts, it has been released with Microsoft Office and other Microsoft products.|$|E
50|$|Two other journals, Simplicissimus, {{published}} in Munich, and Pan, {{published in}} Berlin, {{proved to be}} important proponents of the Jugendstil. The magazines were important for spreading the visual idiom of Jugendstil, especially the graphical qualities. Jugendstil art includes {{a variety of different}} methods, applied by the various individual artists and features the use of hard lines as well as sinuous curves. Methods range from classic to romantic. One feature of Jugendstil is the typography used, the letter and image combination of which is unmistakable. The combination was used for covers of novels, advertisements, and exhibition posters. Designers often used unique <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> that worked harmoniously with the image.|$|R
25|$|Display type {{refers to}} the use of type at large sizes, perhaps 30 points or larger. Some typefaces are {{considered}} useful solely at display sizes, and are known as display faces. Most effect <b>typefaces</b> are <b>display</b> types. Common features of display type include tighter default letter spacing, finer details and serifs, slightly more condensed letter shapes and larger differences between thick and thin strokes; many of these are most visible in serif designs. Many <b>display</b> <b>typefaces</b> in the past such as those intended for posters and newspaper headlines were also only cut in capitals, since it was assumed lower-case would not be needed, or at least with no italics. This was true of many early sans-serif fonts.|$|R
5000|$|Like many {{geometric}} sans-serifs, Century Gothic's {{design has}} a single-story [...] "a" [...] and [...] "g", and an [...] "M" [...] with slanting sides resembling an upturned [...] "W". Century Gothic {{has a high}} x-height (tall lower-case characters). Its origins (see below) come from a design intended for large-print uses such as headings and signs, and so it has a reasonably purely geometric design closely based on the circle and square, with less variation in stroke width than fonts designed for small sizes tend to show, and a relatively slender design in its default weight. Its default spacing is quite tight in the style popular in American post-war <b>display</b> <b>typefaces.</b> Characters are quite wide; Monotype have {{described it as a}} [...] "spacious" [...] design.|$|R
