The Barzaz Breiz brought Breton folk culture for the first time into <b>European</b> <b>awareness.</b> One of the oldest of the collected songs was the legend of Ys.

Hereby, JEF insists on the subsidiarity principle {{as a form of}} decentralized distribution of powers. Another key element is the demand for a unified foreign and security policy of the European Union. JEF is committed to comprehensive reform of the EU towards more democracy, participation, transparency, efficiency and sustainability. In addition to the policy objectives, the organisation tries in particular to promote <b>European</b> <b>awareness</b> among young people and encourage civic activism.|$|E
