5|$|After the Cold War, the {{conflict}} in the Middle East triggered a crisis in 1990, when Iraq under Sadaam Hussein invaded and attempted to annex Kuwait, an ally of the United States. Fearing that the instability would spread to other regions, President George H.W. Bush launched Operation Desert Shield, a defensive force buildup in Saudi Arabia, and Operation Desert Storm, in a staging titled the Gulf War; waged by coalition <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> 34 nations, led by the United States against Iraq ending in the successful expulsion of Iraqi <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> Kuwait, restoring the former monarchy.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the mass behind a punch, {{it is essential to}} move the body as a unit throughout the punch. Power is generated from the ground up, such that <b>force</b> <b>from</b> the ankles transfers to the knees; <b>force</b> <b>from</b> the knees transfers to the thighs; <b>force</b> <b>from</b> the thighs transfers to the core; from the core to the chest; from the chest to the shoulders; from the shoulders to the forearms and finally the compounded force transfers through the fist into an opponent. So the most powerful punchers are able to connect their whole body and channel the <b>force</b> <b>from</b> each portion of the body into a punch.|$|R
5|$|During {{the six-month}} fight against Italy, the Hellenic army made {{territorial}} gains by eliminating Italian salients. Greece {{did not have}} a substantial armaments industry and its equipment and ammunition supplies increasingly relied on stocks captured by British <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> defeated Italian armies in North Africa. To man the Albanian battlefront, the Greek command was forced to withdraw <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> Eastern Macedonia and Western Thrace, because Greek forces could not protect Greece's entire border. The Greek command decided to support its success in Albania, regardless of the risk of a German attack from the Bulgarian border.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the execution of King Louis XVI, revolutionary France was attacked by Prussian and Holy Roman <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> the Austrian Netherlands. Though the French defeated the Austrian army in the Battle of Jemappes in 1792 and briefly occupied the Austrian Netherlands and Prince-Bishopric of Liège, they were pushed out by an Austrian counterattack in the Battle of Neerwinden the following year. In June 1794, French revolutionary troops expelled Holy Roman <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> the region for the last time after the Battle of Fleurus. The French government voted to formally annex the territory in October 1795 and it was split into nine provincial départements within France.|$|E

5|$|In response, the United Nations {{began to}} pass a series of resolutions {{demanding}} the withdrawal of Iraqi <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> Kuwait. Afraid that Saudi Arabia would be invaded next, the Saudi government requested immediate military aid. As a result, the United States began marshalling <b>forces</b> <b>from</b> a variety of nations, styled the Coalition, on the Arabian peninsula. Initially, Saddam Hussein attempted to deter Coalition military action by threatening Kuwait's and Iraq's petroleum production and export. In December 1990, Iraq experimented {{with the use of}} explosives to destroy wellheads {{in the area of the}} Ahmadi loading complex, developing their capability to destroy Kuwait's petroleum infrastructure on a large scale. On 16 January, Iraqi artillery destroyed an oil storage tank in Khafji, Saudi Arabia, and on 19 January the pumps at the Ahmadi loading complex were opened, pouring crude oil into the Persian Gulf. The oil flowed into the sea at a rate of 200,000 barrels a day, becoming one of the worst ecological disasters to that date.|$|E
