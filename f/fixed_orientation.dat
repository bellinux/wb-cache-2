2500|$|As {{common in}} biology, {{there are several}} {{borderline}} cases between solenoid architectures and regular protein domains. Proteins that contain tandem repeats of ordinary domains are very common in eukaryotes. Even if these domains are perfectly capable of folding on their own, some of them might bind together and assume a rigidly <b>fixed</b> <b>orientation</b> in the full protein. These supradomain modules can perform functions that its individual constituents are incapable of [...] A famous example {{is the case of}} tandem BRCT domains, found in the tumor suppressor protein BRCA1. While individual BRCT domains are found in certain proteins (e.g. some DNA ligases) binding DNA, these tandem BRCT domains evolved a novel function: phosphorylated linear motif binding. In the case of BRCA1 (and MDC1), the peptide-binding groove lies in a cleft formed by the junction of the two domains. This elegently explains why individual constituents of this supradomain block are incapable of ligand binding, while their proper assembly endows them with a novel function. Therefore, tandem BRCT domains can be regarded as a form of a single, linear solenoid domain as well.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} emergent structures {{that occur in the}} transient stock material during multi-axis rough machining from a plurality of <b>fixed</b> <b>orientations.</b> Taking the form of thin webs and strings, emergent structures are stock material conditions that can lead to catastrophic failure during machining, even when tool path verification is successful. We begin by discussing the motivation for use of <b>fixed</b> <b>orientations</b> in multi-axis machining using multiple automated setups via rotary axes, which enables fast processing and ‘first part correct’ machining. Next, we demonstrate how unintended emergent structures occur in this paradigm of machining and can lead to catastrophic failure of the tool or work piece. Our original work focuses on the problem of geometric detection of these structures during process planning and prior to tool path planning, to the end of altogether avoiding emergent structure formation. To quickly simulate the machining process, we present an object-space method for determining the transient state of stock material based on the inverse tool offset. To identify emergent structures within this transient stock state, we propose a metric based on the medial axis transformation. Finally, we present our implementation of these methods and demonstrate realtime computation appropriate for an optimization scheme to eliminate emergent structures. Our methods provide consistent and logical results, as demonstrated with several freeform component examples. This work enables the development of robust algorithms for autonomous tool path planning and machining in multi-axis environments...|$|R

RAF 3 can be used either as a fully automatic analog placement tool, or as an interactive tool for creating extremely dense placements from a loose placement provided by the designer to establish neighborhood relations.
