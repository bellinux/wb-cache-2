40|$|The University of Notre Dame Australia {{has once}} again {{received}} the highest accolade from its graduates in the latest results of an independent Australia-wide tertiary survey. The release of the 2013 edition of the Good Universities Guide to Australian Universities and Private Colleges has seen Notre Dame awarded five star ratings for the sixth {{year in a row}} in the categories of Graduate Satisfaction and Teaching Quality. The publication has also awarded Notre Dame five stars for Generic Skills and Entry Flexibility, acknowledging the strength of its application process. The <b>guide</b> <b>profiles</b> all Australian higher education institutions providing information on a range of categories relating to the educational experiences and outcomes of their graduates. Vice Chancellor, Professor Celia Hammond, said she was delighted with the consistent five star ratings Notre Dame had received from this highly influential publication. 2 ̆ 2 The consistency of these significant results, particularly in the areas of Graduate Satisfaction and Teaching Quality, is testament to the commitment of our outstanding staff and evidence that we are successfully achieving our Objects which define our University. 2 ̆ 2 We are delighted to also achieve a five star rating for our entry flexibility. Our admissions process is a distinctive characteristic of our University. We take a comprehensive approach that goes beyond the use of a single score and assesses each applicant on their potential for their chosen course. This is undertaken by looking at their academic achievements to date and a personal statement supporting why they want to study at Notre Dame. Additionally, prospective students are invited to attend an interview. The interview is integral in assisting both the University and the student in determining suitability for study at Notre Dame, 2 ̆ 2 said Professor Hammond. 2 ̆ 2 This begins the pastoral care of our students which continues through to graduation and beyond, 2 ̆ 2 Professor Hammond explained. Pastoral care {{is at the heart of}} Notre Dame 2 ̆ 7 s Objects. These Objects specify the provision of university education within a context of Catholic faith and values; the provision of an excellent standard of teaching; scholarship and research; training for the professions and pastoral care for its students. The Good Universities Guide, now in its 21 st edition, rates a university 2 ̆ 7 s performance on a broad range of indicators and is a valuable resource for students and institutions seeking in-depth information on higher education facilities throughout the country. The University of Notre Dame Australia follows the tradition and practices of Catholic higher education which, for centuries has offered leadership in university education. With campuses in Broome, Fremantle and Sydney, Notre Dame is committed to a personalised education, underpinned by pastoral care and support for all its students.

In actual state (2017) there is floodgate weir with four independent flow fields. This construction is inappropriate in the locality due to the capture of floating debres on the <b>guiding</b> <b>profiles</b> of the weir boards at higher flows, which reduces the flow capacity of the weir profile and consequently the flow over banks of the river Bystřice into the village of Kunčice.

40|$|Variable {{inlet guide}} vane (VIGV) is used to control the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. Due to the tip clearance of the guide vanes and the defect of the traditional <b>guide</b> vane <b>profiles,</b> the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas. Two kinds of inlet flow channels were proposed to eliminate the influence of tip clearance. These structures were numerically investigated at different setting angles. The {{results show that the}} improved channels not only expand the range of mass flow regulation, but also reduce the power and increase the efficiency of the compressor. Ten kinds of <b>guide</b> vane <b>profiles,</b> including different thickness distribution, camber line profile, were selected to compare with the original one and with each other. In the premise of ensuring the performance of compressor, the best <b>guide</b> vane <b>profile</b> was selected. The results show that reducing the guide vane thickness, increasing the guide vane camber angle, and increasing the distance between the maximum camber position and the leading edge of guide vane can help expand the range of mass flow regulation. The achievement of this research can effectively improve the flow regulation ability of VIGV and the performance of compressor...|$|R

METHODS: One hundred and twenty-three patients(245 eyes) were performed LASIK with Q value <b>guided</b> aspheric <b>profile</b> ablation as the intervention group, and 152 patients(304 eyes) were performed conventional LASIK as the control group. Uncorrected and best corrected visual acuity(UCVA and BCVA), refractions, corneal Q-value of the patients in the two groups were measured at postoperative 1 and 3 mo respectively, and the differences of these examinations between the two groups were analyzed. Every patient was interviewed with a questionnaire concerning VF and QOL at 3 mo postoperatively, the grades were measured and analyzed between two groups. RESULTS: At postoperative 3 mo, UCVA was improved in 238 eyes(97. 1 %) in the intervention group and 291 eyes(95. 7 %) in the control group and there was no statistical difference between the two groups(χ 2 = 0. 78, P = 0. 38). Meanwhile, {{there was no significant difference}} in term of postoperative refractions between the two groups(0. 15 ± 0. 58 D vs 0. 11 ± 0. 59 D; t = 0. 75, P = 0. 45). All patients' corneal central Q values increased postoperatively, but the Q value of 0. 28 ± 0. 10 in the intervention group was obviously lower than that of 0. 67 ± 0. 13 in the control group(t =- 38. 71, P = 0. 00). The integrated VF was 50. 50 ± 5. 60 in the intervention group and 48. 36 ± 6. 15 in the control group, there was statistical significance between the two groups(t = 3. 01, P = 0. 00). The scores in the terms of night vision, dark visual field, fine discrimination, contrastive discrimination, glaring and asthenopia in the intervention group were higher than those in the control group, and the differences were statistically significant(all P CONCLUSION:Q value <b>guided</b> aspheric <b>profile</b> and conventional LASIK are safe and efficient for the correction of myopia and astigmatism.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to understand school administrators’ experience using the Youth Smoking Survey (YSS) school smoking profile to inform and improve future knowledge exchange strategies with schools. Methods: This study employed a two-phase, sequential explanatory mixed method approach. Phase One consisted of a close-ended mail-out questionnaire to 111 school administrators who had not viewed their schools’ feedback report. Phase Two consisted of telephone interviews with consenting questionnaire participants. Results: Of the 111 eligible schools, 71 % (N= 79) responded to the questionnaire; 29 school administrators participated in the follow-up interviews. Overall, questionnaire respondents rated the feedback report’s layout very positively in terms of clarity and relevancy, but somewhat less positively on timeliness and level of detail (too much). The majority of school administrators (82 %) plan to use the feedback report when planning programs, curriculum, or events, and would primarily discuss the report with teachers, students, and parents. While interview participants provided positive feedback regarding the communication quality, relevance, timeliness, and content of the smoking profile, further investigation revealed a weak relationship between these information characteristics and knowledge use (conceptual and instrumental). The weak association could be attributed to the small sample (N= 29), the fact that participants had not previously viewed their feedback reports, and did not have adequate time to incorporate the findings into their practice. Conclusions: The findings have contributed to our understanding of the knowledge utilization process of school administrators. Specifically, it examined how end users perceived source and information characteristics in school smoking profile, and the extent conceptual and instrumental knowledge use are associated with the these characteristics.
