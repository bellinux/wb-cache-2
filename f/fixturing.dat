40|$|Abstract- Design of new <b>fixture</b> is a {{modified}} {{over the old}} <b>fixture</b> due to some drawback. The old <b>fixture</b> is not suitable for drum having slot on top face.

Without sufficient gap it is difficult to machine the brake drum bore(pilot diameter), as well as brake drum surface in single set up to achieve the concentricity. Also current <b>fixture</b> is complicated in design and there is more work in fitting the button to <b>fixture</b> ring. So we designed new lathe <b>fixture</b> over the old <b>fixture.</b> In new modified lathe <b>fixture,</b> pads are provided instead of buttons and it could be suitable for brake drum having slot on the top face and other drum also.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Fixture</b> is a work-holding or {{supporting}} device used in {{the manufacturing}} industry to hold the workpiece. <b>Fixtures</b> are used to securely locate (position in a specific location or orientation) and support the work, ensuring that all parts produced using the <b>fixture</b> will maintain conformity and interchangeability. The location of <b>fixture</b> elements is called as <b>fixture</b> layout. The <b>fixture</b> layout plays {{major role in the}} work piece deformation during the machining operation. Hence optimization of <b>fixture</b> layout to minimize the work piece deformation is one of the critical aspects in the <b>fixture</b> design process. Minimization the workpiece deformation which is the objective function in the present work is calculated using Finite Element Method (FEM) and the <b>fixture</b> layout is optimized using Discrete <b>fixture</b> layout optimization method (DFLOM), Continuous <b>fixture</b> layout optimization method (CFLOM) and Integrated <b>fixture</b> layout optimization method (IFLOM). The workpiece deformation is minimum in Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) based IFLOM is reported for the selected <b>fixture.</b> In this paper the PSO is used as an optimization tool to optimize the workpiece deformation...|$|R

40|$|Lighting {{technologies}} for plant growth are improving rapidly, providing numerous options for supplemental lighting in greenhouses. Here we report the photosynthetic (400 - 700 nm) photon efficiency and photon distribution pattern of two double-ended HPS <b>fixtures,</b> five mogul-base HPS <b>fixtures,</b> ten LED <b>fixtures,</b> three ceramic metal halide <b>fixtures,</b> and two fluorescent <b>fixtures.</b> The two most efficient LED {{and the two}} most efficient double-ended HPS <b>fixtures</b> had nearly identical efficiencies at 1. 66 to 1. 70 micromoles per joule. These four <b>fixtures</b> represent a dramatic improvement over the 1. 02 micromoles per joule efficiency of the mogul-base HPS <b>fixtures</b> that are in common use. The best ceramic metal halide and fluorescent <b>fixtures</b> had efficiencies of 1. 46 and 0. 95 micromoles per joule, respectively. We also calculated the initial capital cost of <b>fixtures</b> per photon delivered and determined that LED <b>fixtures</b> cost five to ten times more than HPS <b>fixtures.</b> The five-year electric plus <b>fixture</b> cost per mole of photons is thus 2. 3 times higher for LED <b>fixtures,</b> due to high capital costs. Compared to electric costs, our analysis indicates that the long-term maintenance costs are small for both technologies. If widely spaced benches are {{a necessary part of}} a production system, the unique ability of LED <b>fixtures</b> to efficiently focus photons on specific areas can be used to improve the photon capture by plant canopies. Our analysis demonstrates, however, that the cost per photon delivered is higher in these systems, regardless of <b>fixture</b> category. The lowest lighting system costs are realized when an efficient <b>fixture</b> is coupled with effective canopy photon capture...|$|R
