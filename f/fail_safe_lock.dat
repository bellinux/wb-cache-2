40|$|Optical {{damage that}} results in large scale {{fracture}} has been observed in the large, high-fluence, fused-silica, spatial filter lenses on the Nova and Beamlet lasers. In nearly all cases damage occurs on the vacuum side of the lenses and because the vacuum side of the lens is under tensile stress this damage can lead to catastrophic crack growth if the flaw (damage) size exceeds the critical flaw size for SiO{sub 2 }. The damaged 52 cm Nova lenses fracture into two and sometimes three large pieces. Although under full vacuum load {{at the time they}} fracture, the Nova lenses do not implode. Rather the authors have observed that the pieces lock together and air slowly leaks into the vacuum spatial filter housing through the lens cracks. The Beamlet lenses have a larger aspect ratio and peak tensile stress than Nova. The peak tensile stress {{at the center of the}} output surface of the Beamlet lens is 1, 490 psi versus 810 psi for Nova. During a recent Beamlet high energy shot, a damage spot on the lens grew to the critical flaw size and the lens imploded. Post shot data indicate the lens probably fractured into 5 to 7 pieces, however, unlike Nova, these pieces did not lock together. Analysis shows that the likely source of damage is contamination from pinhole blow-off or out-gassing of volatile materials within the spatial filter. Contamination degrades the antireflection properties of the sol-gel coating and reduces its damage threshold. By changing the design of the Beamlet lens it may be possible to insure that it <b>fails</b> <b>safe</b> by <b>locking</b> up in much that same manner as the Nova lens...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe locking of {{a static}} set of {{database}} transactions {{is discussed in}} the setting of uninterpreted locks. Uninterpreted locks generalize entity locks to the case where any variable may be used for locking, not only those associated with the entities accessed by the transactions. A new condition for safe lockings is presented. There exist safe lockings which could not be accepted by an <b>safe</b> <b>locking</b> in the entity lock model. Moreover, it is shown that the condition is necessary for safety whenever only entity locks are used. It is also shown that there are <b>safe</b> sets of <b>locked</b> transactions not satisfying the condition. This implies that <b>safe</b> <b>locking</b> by uninterpreted locks is too powerful to be completely characterized by our condition; however, our condition is more powerful than <b>safe</b> <b>locking</b> in the entity lock model. The given condition for safety is expressed in geometric terms and it can be used for proving the safety of specific lock policies. In particular, <b>safe</b> pre-analysis <b>lock</b> policies can be designed which strictly dominate the 2 -phase lock policy with respect to the sets of accepted schedules...|$|R

5000|$|During {{the filming}} of Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick learned that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe,</b> a film with a similar theme, was being produced. Although <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> was to be an ultrarealistic thriller, Kubrick feared that its plot {{resemblance}} would damage his films box office potential, especially if it were released first. Indeed, the novel Fail-Safe (on which the film is based) is so similar to Red Alert that Peter George sued on charges of plagiarism and settled out of court. What worried Kubrick most was that <b>Fail</b> <b>Safe</b> boasted acclaimed director Sidney Lumet and first-rate dramatic actors Henry Fonda as the American President and Walter Matthau as the advisor to the Pentagon, Professor Groeteschele. Kubrick decided to throw a legal wrench into <b>Fail</b> <b>Safes</b> production gears. Lumet recalled in the documentary Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove: [...] "We started casting. Fonda was already set ... which of course meant a big commitment in terms of money. I was set, Walter the screenwriter was set ...

A complete experimental and numerical analysis is so necessary to certificate the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> and eventually the damage tolerant behavior of the component. In this paper the <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> behavior of a composite titanium-graphite Rotor Hub is analyzed. The component, with artificial technological defects, was tested with complex contingent fatigue load in order to cause {{the failure of the}} titanium section. The failure started in proximity of a high stressed area and it propagated quickly in the whole titanium section but without involve the surrounding filament winding graphite, that is a <b>fail</b> <b>safe</b> device. The behavior of the hub during the whole test is simulated, with good accuracy, by means of a complete FE model that reproduces also the 3 D propagation of the crack in the titanium section...|$|R
