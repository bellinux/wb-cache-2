40|$|The texture {{inhomogeneity}} during rolling {{is one of}} {{the greatest}} problems. Especially, shear textures develops more easily during <b>ferritic</b> <b>rolling</b> of steel sheets at high temperatures owing to friction between rolls and the material. In this study, the influence of front and back tensions on the texture development during <b>ferritic</b> <b>rolling</b> has been studied. The rolling textures were simulated using the full constraints Taylor-Bishop-Hill model with the strain history obtained from finite element analysis. The calculated textures showed that the back tension rolling could reduce the shear component more effectively than front tension or rolling without tension. However, the experimental results showed that the tension effect was very small compared to the prediction. The results were discussed based on the effects of friction, initial sheet texture, back tension, and flow stress. close 0...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{effects of}} <b>ferritic</b> <b>rolling</b> process on microstructures and {{mechanical}} properties especially drawability of ultra-low carbon (ULC) and Ti-stabilized interstitial-free (Ti-IF) steels were investigated and the precipitates of ferritic-rolled Ti-IF steels were also analyzed. The {{results show that}} good deep drawability are achieved as IF steels are ferritic rolled in good lubricant condition; on the contrary, lubricant condition has less influence on the deep drawability of ULC steels. And with the decrease of rolling temperature in ferrite region, deep drawability of Ti-IF steels are improved, but for ULC steels, when ferritic rolled at low temperature, the r-value is still less than one, which means insignificant deep drawability...|$|E

In this study, we i temperature deep rolling {{as well as}} of consecutive dee fatigue behaviour and residual stress state of norma 1045. For this purpose hysteresis measurements are p that deep rolling at elevated temperatures may significantly enhance fatigue life and strength. Maximum fatigue lives and smallest plastic strain amplitudes in fully reversed push-pull cycling occurs at rolling temperatures of 350 Â°C where dynamic strain ageing is prevalent. Exemplary residual stress measurements show that thermomechanically treated (either high temperature deep rolled or deep rolled plus annealed) samples exhibit more stable residual macro and microstresses during fatigue loading.

40|$|The study {{deals with}} the raise in {{strength}} in TiNb steels through bake hardening and solid solution strengthening, while maintaining a good level of deep drawability. The investigated steels, either ULC or IF, were produced in a 100 kg vacuum melting furnace, hot and cold rolled on a laboratory rolling mill which has a maximum rolling load of 3000 kN, and continuous annealed as 800 mm x 250 mm samples in an annealing simulator. The laboratory processing conditions resulting in best deep drawability, were first studied on a standard TiNb-IF steel. They resulted in a YS of around 100 MPa, r(mean) {{greater than or equal}} to 2. 3, measured on 80 mm gauge length, in the annealed condition. Characteristics of this material were investigated, as well during as after both austenitic and <b>ferritic</b> hot <b>rolling,</b> cold rolling and continuous annealing : mechanical properties, recrystallisation behaviour, texture development and transformation behaviour were studied. Precipitates were investigated through TEM and the findings were compared with the results of thermodynamic calculations. Bake hardening was achieved through free carbon, either present prior to continuous annealing as a consequence of a Nb/C-ratio < 1, or created during annealing followed by relatively rapid cooling as a consequence of decomposition of NbC. For the development of solution strengthened TiNb-IF steels, phosphorus, manganese and silicon were added, as well as small boron additions in order to prevent CWE (cold work embrittlement). Depending on the type of steel, its composition and processing route, minimum yield strength levels of {{greater than or equal to}} 190 MPa or greater than or equal to 260 MPa were achieved, with r(mean) of 1. 7 - 1. 9 on 80 mm gauge length...|$|R
40|$|High-speed steel (HSS) {{materials}} are universally used as work rolls for the hot rolling of stainless steels. Their use {{has increased the}} output of the rolling mill and decreased roll material consumption and grinding. Sticking defects often occur, however, during the hot rolling process. In this article, extreme pressure (EP) additives were dropped on the HSS samples at high temperature. Zinc dialkyl dithiophosphate (ZDDP) was chosen as the most effective EP additive by scratch tests on the HSS samples. In order to determine the optimum proportion of ZDDP in the lubricant, two reduction rates were tested on a Hille 100 experimental rolling mill by hot <b>rolling</b> <b>ferritic</b> stainless steel 445 J 1 M at five different concentrations of ZDDP. The mechanism of EP additive action during the hot rolling process was also investigated. By analyzing the deformation behavior of the oxide scale of samples after hot rolling using different proportions of ZDDP, it was found that 20 % ZDDP in the lubricant is the preferred concentration for industrial application...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The <b>ferritic</b> <b>rolling</b> {{strategy}} {{allows for}} the production of two different hot strip grades, a "soft " and a "hard " hot strip. The "soft " hot strip is rolled in the upper ferrite region and a sufficiently high coiling temperature ensures direct recrystallisation in the coil. The "hard " hot strip is rolled at relatively lower temperatures in the ferrite temperature region and exhibits a strained microstructure with a desirable rolling texture. Furthermore, these ferritic rolled hot strips can be used as initial strip for subsequent cold rolling. The current investigation focuses {{on the development of the}} recrystalli-sation texture of cold rolled and annealed ferritic rolled hot strip for different cold reductions. For this purpose "soft " and "hard " hot strips were produced on a laboratory hot rolling mill. These strips were cold rolled with a total reduction of 40 to 80 % to a final thickness of 0. 5 mm. Subsequently the strips were subjected to simulated continuous annealing, using a salt bath furnace. The macro texture of both types of specimens was measured and correlated to the mechanical properties, including the Lankford values. A very different development of the recrystallisation texture and hence mechanical properties has been observed. However, both grades yielded improved deep-drawing properties...|$|E
40|$|Steel {{producers}} {{are forced to}} reduce the production cost {{on the one hand}} and increase the performances of the products on the other hand, to maintain or even increase their market share. A likely method to save on production costs is to cut down the rather long production chain for conventional cold rolled strip, and to substitute certain cold rolled steel grades by hot rolled steel. Certainly this can rarely be achieved for exposed parts, requiring a perfect surface finish, whereas for unexposed parts, e. g. structural components, with lower surface requirements, the use of hot strips might be a cost saving alternative. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the microstructure and texture development of deep-drawing steels during <b>ferritic</b> <b>rolling,</b> subsequent cold rolling and annealing {{on the one hand and}} to appraise the possible improvement of the mechanical and deep-drawing properties on the other hand. On the basis of these results guidelines for the industrial production of ferritic rolled hot strip are proposed. Furthermore, a new hot rolling strategy for the production of hot rolled low alloy TRIP steel is proposed and the development of the microstructure and the mechanical properties to be obtained are investigated in a set plain strain compression test using a hot deformation simulator.
