5|$|In 1999, the Regional Plan Association {{considered}} a full-length Second Avenue Subway, which included 72nd Street {{as one of}} its planned 31 stations. The <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> 72nd Street station were to be located at 70th, 72nd, and 74th Streets. The final environmental impact statement was released for the station in April 2004. The initial design of the 72nd Street station lasted about eight years, between 1999 and 2007.|$|E
5|$|Protests {{continued}} in Alexandria and Mansoura, where Al Jazeera suggested up {{to a million}} people marched. In Cairo, Egyptian army tanks cleared a highway overpass from which pro-Mubarak protesters had been hurling rocks and Molotov cocktails onto the anti-Mubarak protesters. On the streets below, hundreds of armed soldiers lined up between the two factions, pushing the pro-Mubarak protesters back and blocking the main hotspots {{in front of the}} Egyptian Museum and at other <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the square. Violence was reported to have been perpetrated by police.|$|E

Outside the <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the parking garage stand terminals for city buses.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} entrance hall, {{reception and}} family bedrooms {{were placed on}} the first floor above a low semi-basement containing service rooms. The two principal <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the mansion in the centre of both the north and south facades were accessed by external staircases, originally a single broad flight on the north side and a double staircase on the south. These staircases have since been replaced by simpler designs.|$|E
5|$|There are {{multiple}} gateways around the estate and <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the house. The {{gateway to the}} west of the forecourt was rebuilt in the 1920s with tall piers and moulded stepped caps, permitting a full view of the symmetrical facade of the house. The gateways to the east of the forecourt and to the east of the south lawn have wrought iron gates. The wall around the forecourt is of the same vintage and has rectangular lily ponds at the base.|$|E

5|$|After the war, the Mimoyecques site lay abandoned. Much of the {{equipment}} left by the Germans was disposed of as scrap metal. A complete set of four steel plates, weighing 60 tons, that were intended to protect the <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the drifts were bought by {{the manager of the}} Hidrequent-Rixent quarries to be cut up for use in rock-crushing machinery. Rediscovered by local historians in the 1990s, they remained at the quarries until 2010, when the surviving plates were returned to Mimoyecques, where they are now on display.|$|E
5|$|Bikaner {{came under}} the {{suzerainty}} of the British Raj under a treaty of paramountcy signed in 1818, where after the Maharajas of Bikaner invested heavily on refurbishing their Junagarh fort. However, during the 18th century, before this treaty was signed, there was internecine war between rulers of Bikaner and Jodhpur and also amongst other Thakur, which was put down by the British troops. It is reported that during the attack by Jodhpur army, of the two <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the fort (one {{in the east and}} the other in the west), the eastern entrance and the southern rampart were damaged; marks of cannonballs fired are seen on the southern façade of the fort.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the dam, the <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the two outer diversion tunnels were sealed at the opening and halfway through the tunnels with large concrete plugs. The downstream halves of the tunnels following the inner plugs are now the main bodies of the spillway tunnels. The inner diversion tunnels were plugged at approximately one-third of their length, beyond which they now carry steel pipes connecting the intake towers to the power plant and outlet works. The inner tunnels' outlets are equipped with gates that can be closed to drain the tunnels for maintenance.|$|E

5|$|Fort Tanjong Katong was {{designed}} and built in 1879 by Henry Edward McCallum, who was the Colonial Engineer and Architect of the Singapore History Museum on Stamford Road. The fort reflected the British concerns that other European powers such as the Netherlands and Russia, might attack the strategically located colony founded by Sir Stamford Raffles of the British East India Company in 1819. On the island of Sentosa, Fort Siloso, Fort Connaught and Fort Serapong were built {{around the same time}} as Fort Tanjong Katong, to guard the western and eastern <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the New Harbour (now Keppel Harbour).|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, {{the ship}} was {{decommissioned}} in La Spezia. She was scuttled there on 9 September 1943, {{a day after the}} armistice that ended the war for Italy was declared to prevent her from being seized by the Germans, who rapidly moved to occupy the country after Italy surrendered. The Germans captured the ship and re-floated her, though she was sunk by Allied bombers on 23 October. The Germans re-floated the ship again, and again she was sunk by bombers, on 23 September 1944 in the outer La Spezia roadstead, where the Germans had moved the hulk to block one of the <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the Gulf of La Spezia. Taranto was ultimately raised and broken up for scrap in 1946–1947.|$|E
5|$|Many {{items from}} the battlecruiser were sent to New Zealand after she was scrapped. Equipment {{including}} several 4-inch guns, a range finder and laundry equipment, were used by military units while other artifacts were placed on display in museums. During World War II, the 4-inch guns were the main armament of the land batteries which protected the <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the harbours at Auckland, Wellington and Lyttelton. The captain's piupiu was returned to New Zealand in 2005, and is {{on display at the}} Torpedo Bay Navy Museum in Auckland alongside the ship's bell and other artifacts. The Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa in Wellington also holds several {{items from the}} ship in its collection.|$|E

5|$|Muslim {{residents}} of Israel and Palestinians living in East Jerusalem are normally {{allowed to enter}} the Temple Mount and pray at the al-Aqsa Mosque without restrictions. Due to security measures, the Israeli government occasionally prevents certain groups of Muslims from reaching al-Aqsa by blocking the <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> the complex; the restrictions vary from time to time. At times restrictions have prevented all men under 50 and women under 45 from entering, but married men over 45 are allowed. Sometimes the restrictions are enforced {{on the occasion of}} Friday prayers, other times they are {{over an extended period of}} time. Restrictions are most severe for Gazans, followed by restrictions on those from West Bank. The Israeli government states that the restrictions are in place for security reasons.|$|E
5|$|Recorded {{announcements}} {{are frequently}} made to remind passengers to report suspicious activity {{and not to}} leave their belongings unattended. Digital closed-circuit cameras (CCTVs) have been upgraded with recording-capability at all stations and trains operated by SMRT Corporation. Trash bins and mail boxes {{have been removed from}} station platforms and concourse levels to station <b>entrances,</b> <b>to</b> eliminate the risk of bombs planted in them. Photography without permission was also banned in all MRT stations since the Madrid bombings, but it was not in the official statement in any public transport security reviews.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{legislation}} in North Korea has tightened in recent years, {{although it is}} still relatively lax and has not had any really meaningful effect on curtailing smoking rates. The rules on where people can or cannot smoke are complex, with smoking prohibited on sidewalks, ferries, airplanes and at stations, in health-care and educational facilities, kindergartens and nurseries, shops, theaters, cinemas, culture halls and conference rooms, historic and battle sites, and hotel lobbies. However, smoking is not prohibited in either private or work vehicles or on-board trains, at bus stops, near <b>entrances</b> <b>to</b> buildings, in universities, government offices, workplaces, restaurants, cafes, bars, or nightclubs.|$|E
