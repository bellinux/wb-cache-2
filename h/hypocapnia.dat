25|$|Three {{factors are}} thought to be involved: Voluntary {{suppression}} of breathing and rapid depressurisation are necessarily present, and self-induced <b>hypocapnia</b> by hyperventilation is known to be present in many cases. Depressurisation on ascent is an explanation for the shallow depth of ascent blackouts but does not fully explain all cases unless accompanied by an underlying suppression of the urge to breathe through self-induced <b>hypocapnia</b> via hyperventilation.|$|E
25|$|A {{high level}} of <b>hypocapnia</b> is readily {{identifiable}} as it causes dizziness and tingling of the fingers. These extreme symptoms are caused by the increase of blood pH (alkalosis) following the reduction of carbon dioxide, which is required to maintain the acidity of the blood. The absence of any symptoms of <b>hypocapnia</b> is not {{an indication that the}} diver’s carbon dioxide is within safe limits and cannot be taken as an indication that it is therefore safe to dive. Conservative breath-hold divers who hyperventilate but stop doing so before the onset of these symptoms are likely to be already hypocapnic without knowing it.|$|E
25|$|The primary urge {{to breathe}} is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide (CO2) {{levels in the}} bloodstream. Carbon dioxide builds up in the bloodstream when oxygen is metabolized {{and it needs to}} be expelled as a waste product. The body detects carbon dioxide levels very accurately and relies on this as the primary trigger to control breathing. Hyperventilation artificially depletes the resting concentration of carbon dioxide causing a low blood carbon dioxide condition called <b>hypocapnia.</b> <b>Hypocapnia</b> reduces the reflexive respiratory drive, allows the delay of breathing and leaves the diver susceptible to loss of consciousness from hypoxia. For most healthy people the first sign of low oxygen levels is a greyout or unconsciousness: there is no bodily sensation that warns a diver of an impending blackout.|$|E
25|$|Freediving {{blackout}} {{can occur}} on any dive profile: at constant depth, on an ascent from depth, {{or at the}} surface following ascent from depth and may be described {{by a number of}} terms depending on the dive profile and depth at which consciousness is lost. Blackout during a shallow dive differs from blackout during ascent from a deep dive in that deep water blackout is precipitated by depressurisation on ascent from depth while shallow water blackout is a consequence of <b>hypocapnia</b> following hyperventilation.|$|E
25|$|In {{this article}} {{constant}} pressure blackout and shallow water blackout refers to blackouts {{in shallow water}} following hyperventilation and ascent blackout and deep water blackout refers to blackout on ascent from depth. Some free divers consider blackout on ascent to be a special condition or subset of shallow water blackout but the primary underlying mechanisms differ. This confusion is exacerbated {{by the fact that}} in the case of blackout on ascent, hyperventilation induced <b>hypocapnia</b> also may be a contributory factor even if depressurisation on ascent is the actual precipitator.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for blackout on ascent differs from hyperventilation induced <b>hypocapnia</b> expedited blackouts {{and does not}} necessarily follow hyperventilation. However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and apnoea but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth.|$|E
2500|$|Hypercapnia is the {{opposite}} of <b>hypocapnia,</b> the state of having abnormally reduced levels of carbon dioxide in the blood. [...] The word is from the Greek hyper = [...] "above" [...] or [...] "too much" [...] and kapnos = [...] "smoke".|$|E
2500|$|Self-induced <b>hypocapnia.</b> [...] Hyperventilation {{leading to}} <b>hypocapnia</b> and {{subsequent}} loss of an appropriate urge to breathe is the mechanism behind shallow water blackout. [...] Many practitioners of deep water breath-hold diving use hyperventilation {{with the intention}} of extending their bottom time, so this mechanism is also relevant to deep water blackouts in those cases. If the diver has hyperventilated, the mechanism is essentially that for shallow water blackout but hypoxia is delayed by pressure at depth and sets in only when the pressure drops while surfacing. [...] This explains why divers who black out like this do so very close to the surface on their way up and why they may not have felt any urgency to breathe at all; fit, free-divers ascending from deep dives can black out without any warning.|$|E
2500|$|Above , marked hypoxemia, <b>hypocapnia,</b> and alkalosis are {{characteristic}} of extreme altitudes. Progressive deterioration of physiologic function eventually outstrips acclimatization. As a result, no permanent human habitation occurs above [...] A period of acclimatization is necessary when ascending to extreme altitude; abrupt ascent without supplemental oxygen for other than brief exposures invites severe altitude sickness.|$|E
2500|$|Note {{that the}} urge to breathe is {{triggered}} by rising carbon dioxide levels in the blood and not by the reduction of oxygen. [...] The body can actually detect low levels of oxygen {{but this is not}} normally perceptible prior to blackout. [...] Persistently elevated levels of carbon dioxide in the blood, hypercapnia (the opposite to <b>hypocapnia),</b> tend to desensitise the body to carbon dioxide, in which case the body may come to rely on the oxygen level in the blood to maintain respiratory drive. This is illustrated in the scenario of type II respiratory failure. However, in a normal healthy person there is no subjective awareness of low oxygen levels.|$|E
2500|$|Hyperventilation depletes {{the blood}} of carbon dioxide (<b>hypocapnia),</b> which causes {{respiratory}} alkylosis (increased pH), and causes a leftward shift in the oxygen–hemoglobin dissociation curve. This results in a lower venous partial pressure of oxygen, which worsens hypoxia. A normally ventilated breath-hold usually breaks (from CO2) with over 90% saturation which is far from hypoxia. [...] Hypoxia produces a respiratory drive but {{not as strong as}} the hypercapnic respiratory drive. This has been studied in altitude medicine, where hypoxia occurs without hypercapnia due to the low ambient pressure. The balance between the hypercapnic and hypoxic respiratory drives has genetic variability and can be modified by hypoxic training. These variations imply that predictive risk cannot be reliably estimated, but pre-dive hyperventilation carries definite risks.|$|E

However, hyperventilation will exacerbate the risk {{and there is no}} clear line between them. Shallow water blackouts can happen in extremely shallow water, even on dry land following hyperventilation and apnoea but the effect becomes much more dangerous in the ascent stage of a deep freedive. There is considerable confusion surrounding the terms shallow and deep water blackout and they have been used to refer to different things, or be used interchangeably, in different water sports circles. For example, the term shallow water blackout has been used to describe blackout on ascent because the blackout usually occurs when the diver ascends to a shallow depth. For the purposes of this article there are two separate phenomena Shallow water blackout and Blackout on ascent as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|The breath-hold {{break point}} can be {{suppressed}} or delayed either intentionally or unintentionally. [...] Hyperventilation before any dive, deep or shallow, flushes out {{carbon dioxide in}} the blood resulting in a dive commencing with an abnormally low carbon dioxide level; a potentially dangerous condition known as <b>hypocapnia.</b> [...] The level of {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood after hyperventilation may then be insufficient to trigger the breathing reflex later in the dive and a blackout may occur without warning and before the diver feels any urgent need to breathe. [...] This can occur at any depth and is common in distance breath-hold divers in swimming pools. [...] Hyperventilation is often used by both deep and distance free-divers to flush out carbon dioxide from the lungs to suppress the breathing reflex for longer. It is important not to mistake this for an attempt to increase the body's oxygen store. [...] The body at rest is fully oxygenated by normal breathing and cannot take on any more. [...] Breath holding in water should always be supervised by a second person, as by hyperventilating, one increases the risk of shallow water blackout because insufficient carbon dioxide levels in the blood fail to trigger the breathing reflex.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{scuba diving}} {{curricula}} may apply the terms shallow-water blackout and deep-water blackout differently; deep-water blackout being {{applied to the}} final stage of nitrogen narcosis while shallow water blackout may be applied to a blackout from a deep free dive. [...] Nitrogen narcosis does not normally apply to freediving as free-divers start and finish the dive with only a single lungful of air and it has long been assumed that free divers are not exposed to the necessary pressure for long enough to absorb sufficient nitrogen. [...] Where these terms are used in this manner there is usually little or no discussion of the phenomenon of blackouts not involving depressurisation and the cause may be variously attributed to either depressurisation or <b>hypocapnia</b> or both. This problem may stem from the origin of the term latent hypoxia {{in the context of a}} string of fatal, shallow water accidents with early military, closed-circuit rebreather apparatus prior to the development of effective oxygen partial pressure measurement. In the very different context of dynamic apnea sports careful consideration of terms is needed to avoid potentially dangerous confusion between two phenomena that actually have different characteristics, mechanisms and prevention measures. The application of the term shallow water blackout to deep dives and its subsequent association with extreme sports has tended to mislead many practitioners of static apnea and dynamic apnea distance diving into thinking that it does not apply to them even though isobaric shallow water blackout kills swimmers every year, often in shallow swimming pools.|$|E
