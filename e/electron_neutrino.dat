25|$|The {{antineutrino}} {{discovered by}} Cowan and Reines is the antiparticle of the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino.</b>|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} case of the other charged leptons, the muon has an {{associated}} muon neutrino, denoted by , which is not the same particle as the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino,</b> and does not participate in the same nuclear reactions.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the {{operation}} of the Sun are explained by the Standard Solar Model. In short: when four protons fuse to become one helium nucleus, two of them have to convert into neutrons, and each such conversion releases one <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino.</b>|$|E
50|$|The solar {{neutrino}} {{problem was}} resolved with an improved {{understanding of the}} properties of neutrinos. According to the Standard Model of particle physics, there are three flavors of neutrinos: <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos,</b> muon neutrinos, and tau <b>neutrinos.</b> <b>Electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> are the ones produced in the Sun and the ones detected by the above-mentioned experiments, in particular the chlorine-detector Homestake Mine experiment.|$|R
40|$|We {{propose that}} {{right-handed}} <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> are very long-lived dark matter. The long lifetime is realized by {{the separation of}} the wavefunction of right-handed <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> and that of other fermions in an extra dimension. Such long-lived and superheavy dark matter can naturally explain observed ultra high energy cosmic rays above the GZK cutoff (5 × 10 ^ 19 eV) and huge amounts of cold dark matter simultaneously. Furthermore, the exponentially suppressed Yukawa couplings of right-handed <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> leads to the high predictablilty on the mass parameter of the neutrinoless double beta decay...|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} {{interpretation of}} extensive measurements of <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> (in laboratories located on or somewhat below the Earth's surface) often require geophysical notions concerning the possible neutrino sources. Here, {{we discuss the}} notion that the Earth's core is a substantial source of low energy <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos.</b> Comment: 3 pages, 2 figures, RevTeX forma...|$|R
25|$|The fermions of the Standard Model are {{classified}} {{according to how}} they interact (or equivalently, by what charges they carry). There are six quarks (up, down, charm, strange, top, bottom), and six leptons (electron, <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino,</b> muon, muon neutrino, tau, tau neutrino). Pairs from each classification are grouped {{together to form a}} generation, with corresponding particles exhibiting similar physical behavior (see table).|$|E
25|$|Neutrinos {{oscillate}} {{between different}} flavors in flight. For example, an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> produced in a beta decay reaction may interact {{in a distant}} detector as a muon or tau neutrino. This oscillation occurs because the three mass state components of the produced flavor travel at slightly different speeds, so that their quantum mechanical wave packets develop relative phase shifts that change how they combine to produce a varying superposition of three flavors.|$|E
25|$|Neutrino {{oscillation}} {{arises from}} a mixture between the flavor and mass eigenstates of neutrinos. That is, the three neutrino states that {{interact with the}} charged leptons in weak interactions are each a different superposition of the three neutrino states of definite mass. Neutrinos are created in weak processes in their flavor eigenstates. As a neutrino propagates through space, the quantum mechanical phases of the three mass states advance at slightly different rates due to the slight differences in the neutrino masses. This results in a changing mixture of mass states as the neutrino travels, but a different mixture of mass states corresponds to a different mixture of flavor states. So a neutrino born as, say, an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> will be some mixture of electron, mu, and tau neutrino after traveling some distance. Since the quantum mechanical phase advances in a periodic fashion, after some distance the state will nearly return to the original mixture, and the neutrino will be again mostly <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino.</b> The electron flavor content of the neutrino will then continue to oscillate {{as long as the}} quantum mechanical state maintains coherence. Since mass differences between neutrino flavors are small in comparison with long coherence length for neutrino oscillations this microscopic quantum effect becomes observable over macroscopic distances.|$|E
2500|$|Weak {{interactions}} create neutrinos in one {{of three}} leptonic flavors: <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> (...) , muon neutrinos (...) , or tau neutrinos (...) , in association with the corresponding electron, muon, and tau charged leptons, respectively.|$|R
25|$|For each neutrino, {{there also}} exists a {{corresponding}} antiparticle, called an antineutrino, {{which also has}} half-integer spin and no electric charge. They are distinguished from the neutrinos by having opposite signs of lepton number and chirality. To conserve total lepton number, in nuclear beta decay, <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> appear together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with <b>electrons</b> or <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos.</b>|$|R
50|$|MINOS {{measures}} {{the difference in}} neutrino beam composition and energy distribution in the near and far detectors {{with the aim of}} producing precision measurements of the neutrino squared mass difference and mixing angle. In addition, MINOS looks for the appearance of <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> in the far detector, and will either measure or set a limit on the oscillation probability of muon <b>neutrinos</b> into <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos.</b>|$|R
25|$|When {{the third}} type of lepton, the tau, was {{discovered}} in 1975 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, it too was expected to have an associated neutrino (the tau neutrino). First evidence for this third neutrino type came from the observation of missing energy and momentum in tau decays analogous to the beta decay leading {{to the discovery of}} the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino.</b> The first detection of tau neutrino interactions was announced in summer of 2000 by the DONUT collaboration at Fermilab; its existence had already been inferred by both theoretical consistency and experimental data from the Large Electron–Positron Collider.|$|E
25|$|Standard Model neutrinos are {{fundamental}} point-like particles. An effective size {{can be defined}} using their electroweak cross section (apparent size in electroweak interaction). The average electroweak characteristic size is r2 = n × 10−33cm2 (n × 1nanobarn), where n = 3.2 for <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino,</b> n = 1.7 for muon neutrino and n = 1.0 for tau neutrino; it depends on no other properties than mass. However, this is best understood as being relevant only to probability of scattering. Since the neutrino does not interact electromagnetically, and is defined quantum mechanically by a wavefunction, {{it does not have}} a size in the same sense as everyday objects. Furthermore, processes that produce neutrinos impart such high energies to them that they travel at almost the speed of light. Nevertheless, neutrinos are fermions, and thus obey the Pauli exclusion principle, i.e. that increasing their density forces them into progressively higher momentum states.|$|E
500|$|In {{the theory}} of electroweak interaction, the left-handed {{component}} of electron's wavefunction forms a weak isospin doublet with the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino.</b> This means that during weak interactions, electron neutrinos behave like electrons. Either member of this doublet can undergo a charged current interaction by emitting or absorbing a [...] and be converted into the other member. Charge is conserved during this reaction because the W boson also carries a charge, canceling out any net change during the transmutation. Charged current interactions {{are responsible for the}} phenomenon of beta decay in a radioactive atom. Both the electron and <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> can undergo a neutral current interaction via a [...] exchange, and this is responsible for neutrino-electron elastic scattering.|$|E

500|$|All mesons are {{unstable}} {{because of}} weak decay. In the {{process known as}} beta decay, a down quark in the neutron can change into an up quark by emitting a virtual [...] boson which is then converted into an electron and an electron antineutrino. Another example is the electron capture, a common variant of radioactive decay, wherein a proton and an electron within an atom interact, and are changed to a neutron (an up quark is changed to a down quark) and an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> is emitted.|$|E
500|$|In a 1959 paper Pontecorvo listed 21 {{interactions}} {{that could not}} occur unless the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> (...) and the muon neutrino (...) were one and the same. This paper introduced this notation for neutrinos, which we use today, and listed the reasons why he felt that having two types of neutrinos was [...] "attractive {{from the point of}} view of symmetry and the classification of particles". The prediction that neutrinos associated with electrons are different from those associated with muons was confirmed in 1962. In 1988 Jack Steinberger, Leon M. Lederman and Melvin Schwartz were awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the muon neutrino.|$|E
500|$|After his {{defection}} to the Soviet Union in 1950, {{he worked}} at the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research (JINR) in Dubna. He had proposed using chlorine to detect neutrinos. In a 1959 paper, he argued that the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> (...) and the muon neutrino (...) were different particles. Solar neutrinos were detected by the Homestake Experiment, but only between one third and one half of the predicted number. In response to this solar neutrino problem, he proposed a phenomenon known as neutrino oscillation, whereby electron neutrinos became muon neutrinos. The existence of the oscillations was finally established by the Super-Kamiokande experiment in 1998. He also predicted in 1958 that supernovae would produce intense bursts of neutrinos, which was confirmed in 1987 when Supernova SN1987A was detected by neutrino detectors.|$|E
50|$|The flux of neutrinos at Earth {{is several}} ten billion per square {{centimetre}} per second, {{mostly from the}} Sun's core. They are nevertheless hard to detect, because they interact very weakly with matter, traversing the whole Earth as light does thin air. Of the three types (flavors) of neutrinos known in the Standard Model of particle physics, the Sun produces only <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos.</b> When neutrino detectors became sensitive enough to measure the flow of <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> from the Sun, the number detected was much lower than predicted. In various experiments, the number deficit was between one half and two thirds.|$|R

500|$|The core {{collapse}} {{phase is}} so dense and energetic that only neutrinos {{are able to}} escape. As the protons and electrons combine to form neutrons by means of electron capture, an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> is produced. In a typical Type II supernova, the newly formed neutron core has an initial temperature of about 100 billion kelvins, 104 times {{the temperature of the}} Sun's core. Much of this thermal energy must be shed for a stable neutron star to form, otherwise the neutrons would [...] "boil away". This is accomplished by a further release of neutrinos. These 'thermal' neutrinos form as neutrino-antineutrino pairs of all flavors, and total several times the number of electron-capture neutrinos. The two neutrino production mechanisms convert the gravitational potential energy of the collapse into a ten-second neutrino burst, releasing about 1046 joules (100foe).|$|E

2500|$|The first lepton {{identified}} was the electron, {{discovered by}} J.J. Thomson {{and his team}} of British physicists in 1897. Then in 1930 Wolfgang Pauli postulated the <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> to preserve conservation of energy, conservation of momentum, and conservation of angular momentum in beta decay. Pauli theorized that an undetected particle was carrying away the difference between the energy, momentum, and angular momentum of the initial and observed final particles. The <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino</b> was simply called the neutrino, as it was not yet known that neutrinos came in different flavours (or different [...] "generations").|$|E
50|$|Hydrogen is fused into helium {{through several}} {{different}} interactions in the Sun. The {{vast majority of}} neutrinos are produced through the pp chain, {{a process in which}} four protons are combined to produce two protons, two neutrons, two positrons, and two <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos.</b> Neutrinos are also produced by the CNO cycle, but that process is considerably less important in the Sun than in other stars.|$|R
25|$|In {{the elastic}} {{scattering}} interaction, a neutrino collides with an atomic electron and imparts {{some of its}} energy to the <b>electron.</b> All three <b>neutrinos</b> can participate in this interaction through the exchange of the neutral Z boson, and <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> can also participate with the exchange of a charged W boson. For this reason this interaction is dominated by <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos,</b> {{and this is the}} channel through which the Super-Kamiokande (Super-K) detector can observe solar neutrinos. This interaction is the relativistic equivalent of billiards, and for this reason the electrons produced usually point in the direction that the neutrino was travelling (away from the sun). Because this interaction takes place on atomic electrons it occurs with the same rate in both the heavy and light water.|$|R
50|$|To {{accomplish}} its physics goals, NOνA {{needs to}} be efficient at detecting <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos,</b> which are expected {{to appear in the}} NuMI beam (originally made only of muon neutrinos) as the result of neutrino oscillation.|$|R
2500|$|The {{dominant}} muon {{decay mode}} (sometimes called the Michel decay after Louis Michel) is the simplest possible: the muon decays to an electron, an electron antineutrino, and a muon neutrino. Antimuons, in mirror fashion, most often decay to the corresponding antiparticles: a positron, an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino,</b> and a muon antineutrino. In formulaic terms, these two decays are: ...|$|E
2500|$|To be precise: in the Standard Model with {{neutrino}} mass, a decay like [...] → [...] + [...] {{is technically}} possible, for example by neutrino oscillation of a virtual muon neutrino into an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino,</b> {{but such a}} decay is astronomically unlikely and therefore should be experimentally unobservable: less than one in 1050 muon decays should produce such a decay.|$|E
2500|$|The {{observed}} {{phenomenon is}} known as the GSI anomaly, as the storage ring is a facility at the GSI Helmholtz Centre for Heavy Ion Research in Darmstadt Germany. [...] As the decay process produces an <b>electron</b> <b>neutrino,</b> some of the proposed explanations for the observed oscillation rate invoke neutrino properties. Initial ideas related to flavour oscillation were met with skepticism. [...] A more recent proposal involves mass differences between neutrino mass eigenstates.|$|E
2500|$|For each neutrino, {{there also}} exists a {{corresponding}} antiparticle, called an antineutrino, {{which also has}} no electric charge and half-integer spin.

[...] In all observations so far of leptonic processes (despite extensive and continuing searches for exceptions), there is no overall change in lepton number; for example, if total lepton number is zero in the initial state, <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos</b> appear in the final state together with only positrons (anti-electrons) or electron-antineutrinos, and electron antineutrinos with <b>electrons</b> or <b>electron</b> <b>neutrinos.</b>|$|R
