50|$|The myTouch 4G Slide {{stands out}} amongst other Android {{handsets}} {{because of its}} uncommon physical slide-out <b>four-row</b> <b>keyboard.</b> The Keyboard is backlighted when the Ambient Light Sensor detects low light, but this leaves the keyboard hard to see in many common situations. An aftermarket app called Tasker includes control to force the keyboard backlight to stay on.|$|E

500|$|The Oliver’s typebars {{are bent}} in a bow (forming an {{inverted}} [...] "U" [...] shape) and rest in [...] "towers" [...] {{on the sides}} of the typewriter. This design limited the machine to a three-row QWERTY keyboard as the typebars were stacked such that they grew progressively larger as more were added. The size and usability implications of adding additional keys and thus, more typebars, precluded the addition of a fourth keyboard row dedicated to numbers. Although a four-row prototype was designed in 1922, it was shelved due to the company’s financial troubles at that time. The No. 20, No. 21 and portable models produced by the British Oliver Typewriter Company had <b>four-row</b> <b>keyboards.</b>|$|R

500|$|During its development, the {{typewriter}} {{evolved from a}} crude curiosity into a practical device, the basic form of which became the industry standard. The machine incorporated elements which became fundamental to typewriter design, including a cylindrical platen and a <b>four-rowed</b> QWERTY <b>keyboard.</b> Several design deficiencies remained, however. The Sholes and Glidden could print only upper-case letters—an issue remedied in its successor, the Remington No.2—and was a [...] "blind writer", meaning the typist could not see what was being written as it was entered.|$|R
