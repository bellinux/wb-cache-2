Waiting lists were common at dealerships. Those wanting a new car placed their name, and often a cash deposit, with the dealer. Customers hoped that as new cars became available, they would move up the list until it was their turn to take <b>delivery.</b> <b>Car</b> buyers with their name on every dealer's list in town were not uncommon; reports of money paid under the table were common, as were scalpers who would put their new car on the market at a price considerably higher than they had paid for it.|$|E
50|$|In 1902, Metz {{left the}} company, {{founding}} Metz Motorcycle Company and C.H. Metz Company in town soon after. Engineer Leonard B. Gaylor succeeded him at WMC. The same year, Gaylor introduced a very light model with friction drive, sold as the Orient Buckboard. It seated 2 passengers and sold for just US$425, {{making it the}} lowest-priced automobile available. The vertically mounted air-cooled single-cylinder engine, situated {{at the rear of}} the car, produced 4 hp (3 kW). The car had tiller steering, weighed 500 lb (227 kg) and had a 100 mi (161 km) range, though minimal springing and the complete lack of any bodywork made it less than practical for a long journey. In the next years, it was offered in several models (including a diminutive <b>delivery</b> <b>car),</b> got an improved suspension, steering wheel, two chains instead of one belt to transmit the power to the rear wheels, and an optional 8 hp (6 kW) two cylinder engine. It remained in production until 1907.|$|E
50|$|The Mitsubishi Delica is a {{range of}} trucks and vans built by Mitsubishi since 1968.

The passenger car versions were known as Delica Star Wagon from 1979 until the 1994 introduction of the Delica Space Gear, which became simply Space Gear in Europe at least. The most recent version (not available as a commercial vehicle) is called the Delica D:5.

5000|$|A few anachronisms {{occur as}} well: At the {{beginning}} of the story, two senior Luftwaffe Generals discuss the possibility of Colonel Franz Ritter receiving the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for actions in the Spanish Civil War. The Knight's Cross did not exist in 1937 (when the film is set), first being created at the start of World War II in 1939.Also, at one time Edward Douglas refers {{to the fact that the}} German car manufacturer Opel is to be taken over by General Motors [...] "the next day."

Duncan recalls that Gypsy threatened Wilson's life, and the police lieutenant states that a [...]38 caliber bullet was used to kill Wilson. The houseboy (Joe Bautista) then reveals that right after the murder, he saw a woman wearing a [...] "fuzzy coat and funny hat" [...] hail a yellow cab with a dented fender.|$|E
5000|$|Signer gives {{a humorous}} {{twist to the}} concept of cause and effect and to the {{traditional}} scientific method of experimentation and discovery, taking on the self-evidence of scientific logic as an artistic challenge. As well as working in his studio, which he calls his lab, Signer often takes off to the Swiss mountains to conduct larger experiments. A recent example of his installation work was [...] "Accident as sculpture" [...] (Unfall als Skulptur)(2008) in which Signer had a three-wheeled <b>delivery</b> <b>car,</b> loaded with water barrels, roll down an 11 m high ramp and up the other side. At the apex, the vehicle overturned and crashed to the ground. The resulting chaotic arrangement constituted the exhibition at :de:Kunstraum Dornbirn. Another example, the video 56 Small Helicopters (56 Kleine Helikopter) (2008) shows a squadron of 56 remote-controlled toy helicopters as they rise into the air, collide with each other, carom off the ceiling and walls, and finally die in mechanical spasms on the floor.|$|E
5000|$|Small town {{store owner}} Lum Edwards (Chester Lauck) in Pine Ridge has {{a thorn in}} his side because his partner in the Jot-em-Down general store, Abner Peabody (Norris Goff), has {{exchanged}} the store <b>delivery</b> <b>car</b> for a race track horse. And because Lum doesn't {{have the guts to}} grab the woman he is in love with, Geraldine (ZaSu Pitts), and propose to once and for all, he lays a complex scheme to impress her in a fake [...] "rescue" [...] mission. He fails tremendously in this mission, and nearly gets everyone killed in doing so. However, he doesn't give up, but tries again, and finally succeeds in impressing her. His problems aren't over though, since his proposal, who was to be delivered to Geraldine by his partner Abner, ends up in the wrong hands when it is delivered to a very prone bachelorette, Widder Abernathy (Constance Purdy) instead. She jumps at the possibility of marrying Lum, and the game is afoot. Lum doesn't get out of trouble until the town sheriff (Irving Bacon) finds widow Widder's disappeared husband.|$|E
