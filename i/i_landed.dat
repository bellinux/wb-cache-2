5|$|Empress Maud, {{the only}} {{legitimate}} living child of Henry <b>I,</b> <b>landed</b> in England in 1139 {{in an attempt}} to press her claim to the monarchy. She was soon besieged by King Stephen's forces at Arundel castle. Stephen allowed Maud a safe conduct to Bristol and provided her with an escort, which included William de Braose, suggesting that he was an adherent of King Stephen. William was present as a witness when three charters were issued by Stephen at Lewes dated to the years 1148–53, therefore it appears that he remained loyal to the king until the Treaty of Wallingford ended the hostilities.|$|E

25|$|When King Henry {{died in the}} Duchy of Normandy he {{reiterated that}} Empress Matilda was his heir. Nevertheless, Stephen {{immediately}} set out for England. He crossed the English Channel from Wissant to Dover and then {{made his way to}} London with a few retainers. The people of London acclaimed him king, followed by the nobility and the dead king's ministers. Stephen was crowned on Christmas Eve 1135. During this time, Empress Matilda was powerless to act because her husband Count Geoffrey was busy trying to put down a rebellion in Anjou. Very soon, Stephen's poor leadership attracted enemies. A Scottish army under King David I invaded the north but was beaten at the Battle of the Standard in August 1138. Empress Matilda and Robert of Gloucester, an illegitimate son of Henry <b>I,</b> <b>landed</b> at Portsmouth with 140 men.|$|E

[...] Subsequently, in 1501 and 1502 the Corte-Real brothers, Miguel and Gaspar, explored Newfoundland and Labrador, claiming {{them as part of}} the Portuguese Empire. In 1506, king Manuel I of Portugal created taxes for the cod fisheries in Newfoundland waters.
