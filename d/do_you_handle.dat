5000|$|In 1980 Eugenia Zukerman {{joined the}} staff of CBS News Sunday Morning as its Classical Music Correspondent, a {{position}} she still currently holds. She has also contributed articles to The New York Times, The Washington Post, Esquire and Vogue.

The anthology was featured in the April 2003 edition of O, The Oprah Magazine.

(Statistically, it’s a good bet that Mark {{or one of his}} crew mates would have spent time in Indiana.) Whether you were fabricated in a clean room (robotics), or spent time as a baby (human exploration), your ability to thrive on Mars represents the integration of expertise and experience from a variety of scientific and engineering disciplines. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> being on your own, or dealing with a bad day? This talk covers important concepts (and misconceptions) including analogs, autonomy, resilience, and “human error”. These issues are not just important for doing well on other planets.

40|$|Suggestions about basic {{classroom}} routines {{may help}} teachers {{devote more time}} to teaching. The saying, "It isn't the mountains ahead that wear you out—It's the grain of sand in your shoe " (Priest, 1974), is an apt statement for teachers to reflect upon in their careers as exceptional educators. Not only must teachers meet their students ' needs, organize and present interesting lessons, and manage student behavior (the mountains), but they also must make decisions about bathroom breaks, sharpening pencils, and other mundane mat-ters (the grain of sand) that make a classroom run smoothly. These routine matters revolve around the following questions, adapted from a Florida Diagnostic and Learning Resource-Action Center publication (Staff, 1983) : 1. How do you plan to begin the day or period? 2. How do you plan to end the day or period? 3. How do students ask for help? 4. How do students turn in work? 5. How do students sharpen pencils; get permission to go to the bathroom; get a drink? 6. How <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>handle</b> different task completion rates? (p. 3...|$|E

Widely shall men cleave to that, while it will endure; and quit it with regret, when it gives way under them. Rash enthusiast of Change, beware! Hast thou well considered all that Habit does in this life of ours; how all Knowledge and all Practice hang wondrous over infinite abysses of the Unknown, Impracticable; and our whole being is an infinite abyss, over-arched by Habit, as by a thin Earth-rind, laboriously built together? ...|$|R
