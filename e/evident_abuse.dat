50|$|Inventorship is {{traditionally}} not {{classified as a}} patentability criterion under European patent law, in contrast with U.S. patent law. However, inventorship can be relevant to patentability in Europe, although in only a limited way. Where a disclosure is made within 6 months preceding the filing date of a European patent application, the disclosure is not taken into consideration if it was due to, or in consequence of, an <b>evident</b> <b>abuse</b> {{in relation to the}} applicant or his legal predecessor. Thus the identity of the inventor (who is often the applicant, or his legal predecessor) can be of vital importance.|$|E
50|$|An {{industrial}} design is registrable {{if it is}} new. An {{industrial design}} is deemed to be new if {{it has not been}} disclosed to the public, anywhere in the world, by publication in tangible form or, in Kenya by use or in any other way, prior to the filing date or, where applicable, the priority date of the application for registration. However a disclosure of the industrial design is not taken into consideration if it occurred not earlier than twelve months before the filing date or, where applicable, the priority date of the application and if it was by reason or in consequence of acts committed by the applicant or his predecessor in title; or an <b>evident</b> <b>abuse</b> committed by a third party in relation to the applicant or his predecessor in title.|$|E

40|$|Objective: This study {{developed}} and assessed {{an instrument to}} identify older people {{at high risk of}} abuse based on Reis and Nahmiash’s Indicators of Abuse (IOA) screen. Method: A total of 108 people 65 and older, hospitalized in internal medicine departments at two major hospitals in Israel, were screened together with their principal caregivers. The interview was based on the expanded IOA (E-IOA) and a list of <b>evident</b> signs of <b>abuse.</b> Results: Reliability and validity of the E-IOA were tested and confirmed. Indicators proved to be a significant predictor of <b>evident</b> signs of <b>abuse.</b> The E-IOA correctly discerned 92. 7 % of those at high risk for abuse and 97. 9 % of those who did not suffer abuse. The main indicators for risk were behavioral problems, emotional problems, and family problems of the caregiver and the elderly person. Fourteen (13 %) experienced abuse. Discussion: The proposed assessment tool can be an instrumental guide to identify elderly people who suffer abuse (unidentified) or who are at high risk...|$|R

30|$|There {{is growing}} {{evidence}} that delay discounting {{is associated with}} sexual behavior and risk taking (Dariotis and Johnson 2015; Herrmann et al. 2014, 2015; Johnson and Bruner 2012; Johnson et al. 2015; Jarmolowicz et al. 2015; Jones and Sullivan 2015). Long known {{to be associated with}} substance abuse and problem gambling (Reynolds 2006), delay discounting is a measure of impulsivity that refers to individuals’ tendency to prefer small rewards available immediately or in the near future over larger rewards available at some later time. The subjective devaluation of rewards to be received at a delay has been shown to take a hyperbolic form (Mazur 1987), reflecting a tendency for preferences to shift from larger to smaller rewards as the delay to the small reward decreases. This is <b>evident</b> in substance <b>abuse</b> when, for example, an individual resumes cigarette smoking a day after resolving to quit smoking. The previously preferred larger later reward of better health has been traded for the smaller sooner reward of smoking the cigarette.|$|R
40|$|The {{abuse of}} alcohol can engender serious public health {{problems}} in certain people, particularly {{due to its}} link to violence involving both men and women. This article has the aim to discuss the impact of alcohol in men and women regarding neurobiological mechanisms, emphasizing its psychoactive effects {{as well as its}} implication for violent behavior. An analysis was conduct based on reviews and articles in electronic databases, selected from 1996 to 2008 at Scielo, Lilacs, MEDLINE, Pub Med and Web of Science. From a total of 420 selected articles 90 were considered relevant for this analysis. It was <b>evident</b> that the <b>abuse</b> of alcohol causes changes in neurochemistry and in cognitive functions, and some of those changes lead to violent behavior in men and women. However, there are important differences between both genders and the type of aggressive behavior expressed. Studies on this topic are still rare and more research is necessary in order to develop better diagnostic tools and favor relevant neurobiological mechanisms for more effective treatments...|$|R
40|$|This paper reviews current {{findings}} in the human aggression and antisocial behaviour literature {{and those in the}} animal abuse literature with the aim of highlighting the overlap in conceptualisation. The major aim of this review is to highlight that the co-occurrence between animal abuse behaviours and aggression and violence toward humans can be logically understood through examination of the research evidence for antisocial and aggressive behaviour. From examination through this framework, {{it is not at all}} surprising that the two co-occur. Indeed, it would be surprising if they did not. Animal abuse is one expression of antisocial behaviour. What is also known from the extensive antisocial behaviour literature is that antisocial behaviours co-occur such that the presence of one form of antisocial behaviour is highly predictive of the presence of other antisocial behaviours. From such a framework, it becomes <b>evident</b> that animal <b>abuse</b> should be considered an important indicator of antisocial behaviour and violence as are other aggressive and antisocial behaviours. The implications of such a stance are that law enforcement, health and other professionals should not minimize the presence of animal abuse in their law enforcement, prevention, and treatment decisions...|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} on substance (alcohol, tobacco and drug) abuse and on self-perception {{was done by}} comparing a test group of physically disabled adolescents and a test group of non-disabled adolescents. The respondents {{of the experimental group}} were students of the only special high school for physically handicapped persons in Croatia, Zagreb. The respondents of the control group were the students of two regular high schools in the capital of Croatia. The instrument used in this research was a self-reported, anonymous questionnaire. The respondents completed the questionnaire in the classroom. The data analysis regarding alcohol abuse indicated that physically disabled adolescents drink more often and out of quite different motives than their non-disabled peers. Regarding the prevalence, frequency, quantity and motives for smoking, no statistically significant difference has been found between the tested groups. On the contrary, significant differences between handicapped and non-disabled adolescents were <b>evident</b> regarding drug <b>abuse.</b> Only one physically disabled examinee used a drug – marijuana, only a few times a year. On the other hand, almost one quarter of the non-disabled adolescents use at least one, five at the most, type of drug sometimes or often. The results on the self-perception scale show that adolescent with physical disabilities have a much more negative attitude toward themselves than non-disabled controls. Their self-esteem and self-confidence are seriously diminished. Described findings could have a mighty impact on ways of preventing substance abuse, and on ways of increasing self-esteem among disabled and non-disabled adolescents...|$|R
40|$|O uso nocivo do álcool configura-se como um problema de saúde pública, associado ao aumento da violência, envolvendo ambos os sexos. Esse artigo tem por objetivo {{discutir}} sobre o impacto do uso do álcool em homens e mulheres do ponto de vista neurobiológico, enfatizando a ação psicoativa da substância e sua implicação no comportamento violento. Foi conduzida uma análise baseada em artigos selecionados nas fontes eletrônicas do Scielo, LILACS, MEDLINE, PubMed e Web of Science no período de 1996 a 2008. Do total de 420 artigos selecionados, 90 foram considerados relevantes para a análise. Verificou-se que o uso nocivo do álcool causa mudanças neuroquímicas e alterações nas funções cognitivas, podendo gerar comportamentos violentos em homens e mulheres, entretanto, evidenciou-se importantes diferenças entre os sexos quanto à ação psicoativa do álcool, assim como, no tipo de violência expressa. Estudos sobre a temática proposta ainda são escassos, sugerindo a necessidade de pesquisas futuras que possam contribuir para um melhor entendimento e para ações preventivas eficazes.

40|$|Norway {{has become}} a {{multicultural}} society with an ever increasing global interdependence. With the increasing complexity and interdependence of economic, political and social affairs, similarities and differences among cultural groups are more <b>evident.</b> The substance <b>abuse</b> care services are multileveled and complex, with different service providers offering similar services in different setups. In addition, these services {{appear to have been}} tailored to suit the ethnic majority and are to some extent not culturally responsive {{to the needs of the}} ethnic minority clients. It is, therefore, becoming a challenge to assume that mainstream therapeutic treatment services will be applicable to the ethnic minority, unless it culturally adapted. Clients have a right to access individually tailored treatment based on the client’s needs and situation. A single national treatment intervention is no longer acceptable as a viable concept for the treatment process. Norwegian treatment programmes and clinical practices should reflect aspects of diversity in order to meet the unique and distinct therapeutic needs of each ethnic minority client. When the discussions of cultural competency arise; the question often asked is how does one become culturally competent? How can a therapist provide culturally competent interventions that can lead to a successful outcome? The findings indicate that applying culturally sensitive interventions in various stages of therapy, can offer an opportunity for the client and the therapist to deconstruct the hindering cultural constructions and reconstruct new and common realities. Culturally sensitive interventions, allows the therapist to acknowledge the client’s experience and worldview, and opens up possibilities for change according to the client’s goals. However, means to integrate cultural issues in each stage of counseling is virtually missing. In the context of a therapeutic relationship, the study suggests that the therapist should develop a position that interacts with the values, beliefs, experiences, responses and ideas of the client; and together they construct culturally sensitive therapeutic realities and solutions. As such, no psychotherapeutic treatment orientation could be more appropriate and legitimate than one that is multicultural, one that involves client’s own contribution. This thesis attempted to investigate the application of social constructionist approaches in therapy. The major aim was to find out the qualitative effects of involving ethnic minorities’ own needs and contribution in psychotherapy. Semi-structured interviews with psychologists and ethnic minority clients formed the main source of data for this study...|$|R
40|$|A truth that's told {{with bad}} intent beats all the lies you can invent. William Blake (1757 – 1827) The ethical {{dimension}} of leadership {{has been widely}} acknowledged as being important in the contemporary business environment (Brown & Trevino, 2006 a; Brown & Mitchell, 2010; Ciulla, 2005; Knights & O’Leary, 2005; Trevino, Hartman & Brown, 2000). Indeed, Ciulla (1998) proposed that ethics is at the ‘heart of leadership’. Many scholars have examined ethics and leadership from a normative or philosophical perspective, which suggests what leaders ought to do, rather than what they actually do (Brown, 2007). More recently, the study of ethics and leadership has been undertaken from a more socio-scientific perspective. This {{has led to the}} development and conceptualisation of the construct ethical leadership, which includes the exploration of the characteristics of ethical leadership and the identification of its antecedents and consequences (Brown & Trevino, 2006 b; Brown, Trevino & Harrison, 2005; Trevino et al., 2000; Trevino, Brown & Hartman, 2003). This research poses the question: what is ethical leadership? It seeks to build on the existing body of empirical research relating to the characteristics and behaviours of ethical leaders. The inclusion of a question, which asks participants their recollections of unethical leadership, represents an important contribution to {{research in the area of}} ethics and leadership. Seventy-eight (78) senior executives, represented by diverse industry backgrounds from both the public and private sectors, participated in the research. They were drawn from two states in Australia, namely Western Australia and Victoria. This research adopted a constructivist methodology and two qualitative methods: the critical incident technique (CIT) (Flanagan, 1954) and a hypothetical vignette (Alexander & Becker, 1978; Aveyard & Woolliams, 2006; Fritzche, 2000; Trevino, 1992 b). Semi-structured, face-to-face interviews were undertaken for the purpose of data collection. The qualitative software package NVivo was used to assist in the management of the research data. NVivo's principal function is that of an electronic storage and retrieval system. Before its development this process was manually carried out by researchers. First, participants were asked to recall the characteristics and behaviours of two leaders with whom they had worked: one identified as being an ethical leader and the other a less than ethical leader. Second, participants described an ethical dilemma they had experienced and managed in their role as a senior executive. Third and finally, their responses to a hypothetical vignette that contained an ethical dilemma were sought. These responses were then aligned with their own ethical dilemmas to determine whether their espoused theories (what they said they would do) were congruent with their theories-in-use (what they actually did). The principal findings that emerged in this research are as follows. Participants' recollections of ethical leadership centred on three themes: value alignment, governance and relationship-centredness. Ethical leaders are perceived to be individuals who behave with integrity, courage and trustworthiness. They are relationship-centred, and fairness and altruism are the defining features of their relationships with others. In matters of governance, ethical leaders demonstrate adherence to accountability measures and discernment in their decision-making responsibilities. These findings were opposed to recollections relating to less than ethical leaders, who are defined by deception and self-centredness. In matters of governance, the decision-making of less than ethical leaders reflected culpability and expediency. Their self-centredness was <b>evident</b> in their <b>abuse</b> of power and their self-serving behaviour. When participants' responses to the hypothetical vignette were aligned with responses to their own ethical dilemmas, incongruence was evident. That is, the action many participants said they would take in response to the hypothetical vignette did not align with what they actually did in response to their own ethical dilemmas. This incongruence was most evident in two areas. In the management of their own dilemmas, participants were strongly focused on relationships with others and did not consider withdrawing from the situation. However, in response to the hypothetical vignette, participants demonstrated a greater willingness to withdraw from the situation and placed much less emphasis on their relationship with others. Finally, this study concludes that an ethical leader is perceived as an individual whose words and actions are closely aligned (value alignment). Conversely, less than ethical leaders are characterised by deception; that is, there is misalignment between what they say and what they do...|$|R
