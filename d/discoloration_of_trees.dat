50|$|An {{extensively}} studied {{example of}} niche microdifferentiation is the melanism of Peppered Moths near industrial centers of England {{during and after}} the Industrial Revolution. A drastic increase in the use of coal led to severe pollution which caused <b>discoloration</b> <b>of</b> buildings and <b>trees</b> and the reduced prevalence of lichen. Peppered Moths are typically mottled in color, but during this time, a subspecies of the Peppered Moth, Biston betularia f. carbonaria, which is dark gray or black, became more prevalent near industrial cities. Research has shown that due to decreased visibility in their respective habitats, the typical mottled moths have an adaptive advantage in “clean,” rural areas where lichen is more prevalent, while carbonaria varieties have an advantage in polluted areas where coal smoke has blackened buildings and reduced lichen populations. This decreased visibility to predators protects the moths and gives them an evolutionary advantage. See also Peppered moth evolution.|$|R
40|$|Slovakia is a mountainous and forested country (40. 6 percent forest cover) {{in central}} Europe {{and has a}} large variety of {{vegetation}} zones, forest types, and a rich diversity <b>of</b> forest <b>tree</b> species. The most important tree species are beech (Fagus sylvatica L.), Norway spruce (Picea abies Karst.), oak species (Quercus sp.), Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.), silver fir (Abies alba Mill.), European hornbeam (Carpinus betulus L.), European larch (Larix decidua Mill.), poplars and willows (Populus L. sp., Salix L. sp.), and other hardwood broadleaves. On the basis of results of the Forest Health Monitoring System from 1987 to 1994, the scientific information is presented for the following parameters: defoliation, <b>discoloration,</b> percentage <b>of</b> <b>tree</b> number in classes of damage, and percentage of salvage cut in the total annual cut. The percentage <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> in the defoliation classes 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 were 14. 7, 43. 5, 36. 2, 4. 3, and 1. 3, respectively (class 0 means healthy trees; class 4 dead trees). The discoloration classes (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) were represented by 98. 0, 1. 7, 0. 3, 0, and 0 percent for all tree species together. The average defoliation percentage from 1987 to 1994 decreased with time {{and is expected to}} further decrease in the following years. However, the percentage of annual salvage cut in the total annual cut increased between 1987 and 1994. Various biotic and abiotic factors influence forest health in Slovakia, such as air pollution, wind and snow, damages by beetles, sucking insects, and game. Global climate change seems {{to be the most important}} among them...|$|R
5000|$|Forest dieback {{has many}} symptoms: falling off {{of leaves and}} needles, <b>discoloration</b> <b>of</b> leaves and needles, {{thinning}} of the crowns <b>of</b> <b>trees,</b> dead stands <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> <b>of</b> a certain age, {{and changes in the}} roots <b>of</b> the <b>trees.</b> Forest dieback has many dynamic forms. A stand <b>of</b> <b>trees</b> can exhibit mild symptoms, extreme systems, or death at the same time. Forest decline can be viewed as the result of continued, widespread, and severe dieback of multiple species in the forest. [...] Current forest decline is described by rapid development on individual trees, occurrence in different forest types, a long duration (over 10 years), and occurrence throughout the natural range of affected species.|$|R

40|$|With 40 kg N ha- 1 yr- 1 the Netherlands is {{the country}} with the highest {{nitrogen}} deposition in Europe. Approximately 2 / 3 of the nitrogen deposition is from NH(x). Considering defoliation and <b>discoloration</b> <b>of</b> the foliage, <b>tree</b> vitality <b>of</b> Dutch forest is poor, and declining for some tree species. Nevertheless the wood production is normal or relatively high, except in highly polluted regions. At many locations the N status of the foliage and the Al 3 /Ca 2 and NH 4 /K in the soil solution exceed assumed critical levels. But these exceedances are not well correlated with the loss and color of foliage. From laboratory experiments it is evident that these exceedances cause enhanced risk for damage by biotic and abiotic stresses, but only few indications exist that this has a severe impact on tree growth in Dutch forests. In contrast, the species composition of the undergrowth has been changed drastically, from a lichen dominated to a grass-dominated vegetation. Prediction of the future performance of the forest is complicated by several crucial gaps in knowledge. One is that the relation between nitrogen deposition and risks for damage by secondary stresses is still poorly validated in the field situation, and another is that the assumption in the critical load concept of a similarity in effects of the different forms of nitrogen deposition may be wrong...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the effect coextruding a clear HDPE cap layer onto HDPE/wood-flour composites has on the <b>discoloration</b> <b>of</b> coextruded composites exposed to accelerated UV tests. Chroma meter, XPS, SEM, and UV vis measurements accounted for the analysis <b>of</b> <b>discoloration</b> and degree <b>of</b> oxidation of both uncapped (control) and coextruded composites before and after UV exposures. Two separate discoloration characteristics occurred in the <b>discoloration</b> <b>of</b> composites. For uncapped WPCs (control), chemical changes due to photooxidation resulted in darkening followed by physical changes, including loss of colored wood components from the surface, as well as increased roughness on the surface, which led to lightening of WPCs. By contrast, because a hydrophobic cap layer prevented the loss of colored components from the surface, coextruding a clear hydrophobic HDPE cap layer over WPCs significantly decreased the discoloration during the weathering process. Photooxidation of wood components at the interface accounted for the <b>discoloration</b> <b>of</b> coextruded WPCs before the failure of cap layer. Moreover, as the cap layer absorbed a specified amount of UV light and reduced oxygen available to interface, it decreased the photooxidation rate at the interface compared to that at the WPCs surface. ...|$|R
