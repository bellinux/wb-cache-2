500|$|William's actions at the Siege of Antioch {{are known}} from the Gesta Francorum, an {{anonymous}} chronicle written by an Italo-Norman eyewitness. The Gesta was very popular in Europe after the crusade, but was considered crudely written by more refined readers. It was later rewritten and expanded by more educated writers, including the French monks Robert and Guibert, {{both of whom were}} eager to add information about French crusaders like William. According to Robert, William [...] "acquired the name of 'Carpenter' because nobody wanted to take him on in battle—-there was no breastplate, helmet or shield which could withstand the shattering impact of his lance or sword." [...] Guibert says that he [...] "was called the Carpenter, not because he was a craftsman in wood, but because he prevailed in battle like a carpenter, by cutting men down", and has Bohemond ask: [...] "what kind of Carpenter <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>have,</b> who, like a construction-worker with a pick-axe, hacked away, with lances and swords, at the backs of the Gentiles?" [...] Christopher Tyerman interprets this as William's [...] "skills as a battlefield butcher". Edward Gibbon, apparently misunderstanding Guibert, thought the nickname came [...] "from the weighty strokes of his axe".|$|E

During the December 25 performance of Caesar — when the sets, lighting and costumes for Shoemaker were ready but no previews had taken place — Welles asked the cast if they cared to present a surprise preview immediately after the show. He invited the audience to stay and watch the set changes, and the curtain rose at 1:15a.m. Lloyd recalled it as [...] "the wildest triumph imaginable.

2500|$|After the 2005 Kashmir earthquake, Cuba {{sent over}} 2,400 {{physicians}} and paramedical staff and established 32 field hospitals and two relief {{camps in the}} North-West Frontier Province (NWFP) and Azad Jammu and Kashmir. A total of 36 transport flights were made. In addition to nurses, paramedics and doctors the initial two flights were only of military trained physicians. Tons of medical equipment and medicines were sent {{by the government of}} Cuba. Approximately 30 amputee patients were flown to Cuba for treatments. Pakistani president Pervez Musharraf expressed his contentment at the efforts of Fidel Castro and appreciated the services of the Cuban medical teams. Dr. Juan Carlos Martín, Director of the Cuban field hospital in Muzaffarabad, said [...] "We knew this had to be a closed-loop relief effort. Not only <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> to bring the medicines and the doctors, we had to provide everything – the hospital, the electricity, the plumbing, the beds – to run that hospital". From October, 2005 to January 24, 2006, Cuban medical teams performed 601,369 consultations, 5,925 surgeries including 2,819 major surgeries and served at 44 different locations in the quake-affected region.|$|E
2500|$|Jagland {{launched}} {{his vision of}} the [...] "Norwegian House" [...] during his tenure as Prime Minister. In his speech to the Storting following his appointment, Jagland described the Norwegian House as a foundation with four pillars. The metaphor represented, [...] "the collective value creation within the ecologically sustainable society". The four pillars that hold up the house were business and labour policy; welfare policy; research and educational policy; and foreign and security policy. Jagland stated that everyone had something to contribute regarding the creation of the house; in particular he stated that the cabinet would cooperate with the opposition to reach these goals. In his speech, Jagland said that he would not deviate much from Harlem Brundtland's policies, but that he would increase the focus on violence, abuse of alcohol and drugs, and crime, including improvement of preventative measures and the courts. He also stated {{that it was important to}} introduce information technology in all parts of the education system. As part of the construction of the Norwegian House, the cabinet also started to appoint lay councils, with expertise within their fields, that would provide them with feedback and inputs on important areas in society. Jagland stated that the purpose was to allow critical voices close access to the political decisions, and increase the number of ideas generated at a political level. Jagland stated in August 2008 that, [...] "the Norwegian House could have been better planned and prepared, but I did not have the time. I took a chance. The Labour Party was down for the count. My goal was to make a good election; and we <b>did.</b> <b>We</b> <b>have</b> not done so well since". Jagland said in an interview, [...] "I still get letters from people who miss the Norwegian House. It was an attempt at something new, a building project that would also inspire the activity on the side of the parties".|$|E

2500|$|... “The old days. [...] After all {{the fall}} of 1906 is a far piece back, and high school {{football}} then was a mighty casual and simple thing. [...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor <b>did</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games. [...] I can’t remember who we beat, but I do recall, painfully even after this lapse of time, that our friends over at the county seat (Canton, Ohio) took us to the cleaners twice.” ...|$|E
