50|$|A <b>drill</b> <b>jig</b> {{is a type}} of jig that expedites {{repetitive}} hole center {{location on}} multiple interchangeable parts by acting as a template to guide the twist drill or other boring device into the precise location of each intended hole center. In metalworking practice, typically a hardened drill bushing lines each hole on the jig plate to keep the tool from damaging the jig.|$|E
50|$|Ongoing {{evolution}} of computerized design and control technologies, such as CAD/CAM, CNC, PLC, and others, has limited {{the use of}} jigs in manufacturing, however all the computer run machines need some sort of clamping fixture for production runs. A common example is that a <b>drill</b> <b>jig</b> is not needed to guide the drill bits to the hole centers if it is done on a CNC, since it is Computer Numerically Controlled. However, fixtures are still needed to hold the parts {{in place for the}} operation needed. Jigs are currently needed in many areas of manufacturing but mainly for low-volume production.|$|E

50|$|<b>Drill</b> <b>jigs</b> started {{falling into}} disuse with the {{invention}} of the jig borer.|$|R
5000|$|Before the {{jig borer}} was developed, hole center {{location}} had been accomplished either with layout (either quickly-but-imprecisely or painstakingly-and-precisely) or with <b>drill</b> <b>jigs</b> (themselves made with painstaking-and-precise layout). The jig borer was invented to expedite {{the making of}} <b>drill</b> <b>jigs,</b> but it helped to {{eliminate the need for}} <b>drill</b> <b>jigs</b> entirely by making quick precision directly available for the parts that the jigs would have been created for. The revolutionary underlying principle was that advances in machine tool control that expedited the making of jigs were fundamentally a way to expedite the cutting process itself, for which the jig was just a means to an end. Thus the jig borer's development helped advance machine tool technology toward later NC and CNC development. The jig borer was a logical extension of manual machine tool technology that began to incorporate some then-novel concepts that would become routine with NC and CNC control, such as: ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} an attempt {{has been made}} to design, analyse and {{fabricate}} a linear two axis indexing <b>drill</b> <b>jig.</b> Basically, Jig is a work holding device which also guides the tool. The main purpose of making this Jig is to perform “chain drilling” without any need of shifting the job regularly, as the drilling spot is located by the movement of the tables on both X-Y directions. This results in reduction in production time and can be used for mass production. The movement of the tables is done with the help of lead screws. We have also screwed scales {{in the body of the}} jig so that the job doesn’t have to be measured again and again which will result in more time consumption, Therefore the main purpose of a linear two axis indexing <b>drill</b> <b>jig</b> is to drill proper, more accurate and precise holes...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In modern {{manufacturing}} industry, {{there are}} a great deal of micro inclined holes, which is a difficult problem to machining. A novel micro inclined hole drilling method, step vibration drilling, is adopted. The experiments are carried that 45 degrees inclined hole is drilled into the 45 steel workpiece with Φ 0. 5 mm carbide drill bit. The notable result was obtained with the method of step vibration drilling for drilling 45 degrees inclined holes on 45 steel, which break the restriction of <b>drill</b> <b>jig.</b> The new approach is put forward for micro inclined hole...|$|E
40|$|The {{target of}} the mass {{production}} {{is to increase the}} productivity and increase the accuracy. This is done by reducing the set up cost and manual fatigue. Thus mass production can be achieved by the use of jigs. For large scale production of different materials a lot of time is wasted in set up of the device and clamping the device. Trial and error method is usually practiced until the axis of the hole is properly aligned with the axis of the drill. In such a situation a lot of time is being wasted to maintain the accuracy. Eventually it increases the operator’s fatigue. Thus <b>drill</b> <b>jig</b> increases productivity by eliminating individual positioning, marking and frequent checking. The main advantage of the jigs is interchangeability. A fixture is a production tool. The main aim is to locate, hold and support the work securely so that the required machining operations can be performed. Set blocks and feeler or thickness gauges are also used to provide reference of the cutter with the workpiece. A fixture must be easily fastened with the table and the machine. As a result the work can be done. Fixture is largely used in milling machines. But it can also be used for other operations on most of the standard machining tools like drilling machine. Fixtures are available in different shape and sizes ranging from simple and cheap devices to very expensive and complicated devices. Fixtures can also help to simplify the metalworking operations which are performed on the special equipment. Considering the advantages of jigs and fixtures, a fixture was designed to cater to our needs...|$|E

40|$|The most {{important}} current problem associated with aircraft production is {{the necessity for}} {{a reduction in the}} time cycle from design to completion of the first production machine. Tool manufacture is one aspect in which improvement is desirable. The use of thermo- and setting-plastics for drop-hammer and double-curvature panel <b>drill</b> <b>jigs</b> is examined aver a wide technical and economic field, in order to establish a sound foundation for investigating the suitability of plastics for tooling. Tools were designed to isolate the variable parameters and a study of their behaviour has commenced, dth the assistance of high-speed filming, to ascertain the limitations of the various materials. Casting resins are preferable for both punches and dies although the laminated form, in addition to being the better type for pcnel <b>drill</b> <b>jigs,</b> appears to be the most satisfactory die material available at present. It was concluded that plastics facilitate easier and cheaper tool production titan is practicable with zinc and, for the tools produced, reduce the necessary time cycle of production by about 80 per cent with a corresponding reduction in the man. - hours required. In the tests made to develop suitable plastic tools, attention was concentrated on the development of a suitable slightly flexible punch, and a rigid diet following the most promising indications of this work. It was found that Tenite Medium Bard was a good punch material with a life of over 1, 000 components, the springback differing from that of a Kayen Alloy punch by less than one degree for all the tool shapes tested. The economic savings are approximately cost 87 per cent, man-hours 84 per cent, and time cycle 81 per cent. It should. be noted that the;lunch and die selected for this test was a severe forming case of a double curvature bead. The most satisfactory die developed was manufactured from Aralditc D resin, glass fibre and french chalk. Limited tests with a Tenite M.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} design and {{development}} of the <b>drill</b> bit sharpening <b>jigs</b> for bench grinder. The objective of this thesis is to design the <b>drill</b> bit sharpener <b>jig</b> that enhance the better outcome rather than manual sharpening operation. The thesis follows with the development of the <b>drill</b> bit sharpening <b>jig</b> that can be attached to the bench grinder. The structural three-dimensional solid modeling of <b>drill</b> bit sharpening <b>jig</b> was developed using the computer-aided drawing software which is CATIA V 5 R 21. The strategy of validation of the model design was developed. The generative part structural analysis was then performed using simulation in CATIA V 5 R 21 to detect the Von Mises distribution. The design and suitable material will be validated. The fabrication of the jig may undergoes in various machining process such as milling, turning, electrical discharge wirecut and grinding. The assembled part shall be tested on the bench grinder. Besides, several dull drill bits will be sharpen using the jig. These assessment results are significant to improve the component design at the early developing stage. Further analysis will be conducted by testing the drilling process on the workpiece. The resharpen drill bits and the new drill bits will results on the difference surface roughness. Thus, the surface roughness analysis is performed to distinguish hole surface roughness outcomes for both drill bits. The results shows the difference of surface roughness between both hole surface is small and insignificant. Thus, it means that the outcomes is relatively same. The jig can also significantly reduce the cost and time to market, and improve product reliability and customer confidence...|$|R
40|$|In oral implantology, proper {{execution}} of the holes for the installation of dental implants {{is directly related to}} the correct functioning and durability of the system itself. For this reason, the procedure discussed here, which was once performed freehand in all its phases, is now being implemented through aids with more precision. Masks currently in use are created in resin ad hoc; surgical stents are inserted into the holes that will then be used as a guide. These aids are fixed into the jaw by means of micro bone screws in order to prevent movement during surgery. Despite this, we still use the guides as they are, centered properly with the help of <b>drilling</b> <b>jigs.</b> The same technique is also used in partially edentulous cases through smaller jig fixed on teeth near to the implant zone. In this article, we propose a guidance system for milling cutters used in partially edentulous cases involving from one to three adjacent installations. The purpose of the study was to realize a modular model adaptable to most dental implants, as well as efficient, quick, and low cost by pouring the resin into a plaster mold of the teeth, and then drilling the masks into position in the plants at the required angle...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented {{on the effects}} of bolt-hole clearance on the load distribution in multi-bolt composite joints. Single-shear, three-bolt joints were studied. The specimens were manufactured from graphite/epoxy HTA/ 6376, with quasi-isotropic lay-ups. Protruding head bolts of 8 mm diameter and torqued to finger-tight conditions were used. Different combinations of clearance were obtained by using four different reamers and a purpose-designed high-precision <b>drilling</b> <b>jig.</b> Instrumented bolts with strain gauges attached for measurement of shear strain at the shear plane, were used to measure bolt load distribution. Prior to use in the multi-bolt joints, the bolts were calibrated in single-bolt joints. For assembly of the multi-bolt joints, a special jig had to be designed to allow simultaneous aligning of the bolt along the axis of the joint, centring of each bolt in its hole, and torquing of the bolts to a prescribed level. The results of the study show that relatively small amounts of clearance can have substantial effects on load distribution. As an example, the middle bolt in a joint of this type is normally assumed to carry less load than the outer bolts, and is therefore considered not to be under threat of failure. But in the presence of clearance the load can shift to the middle bolt, potentially causing an unexpected failure mode...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} dealing with the {{engineering}} design of a gang <b>drilling</b> machine with <b>jig</b> & fixtures to make a prototype machine. This effort has been done in order to solve the problem which aroused in small business enterprises producing birdcages. The problem was how to minimize the production time in making a lot of holes that have same distance and straightness. Hopefully, the prototype machine can help the small business enterprises to increase their production rate. The design engineering process has been carried out by variant approximation on dowel pin modular fixtures in order to simplify fixtures design. CAD CAM software has also been used as fixtures synthesized method including geometric analysis and three dimensional fixtures assembling. The resulting prototype machine can be well operated and based on the running test, it can be concluded that the greater the motor rotation the greater the power needed. As for teak wood, at 250 rpm motor rotation the power needed is 26. 5 watt, and at 400 rpm the motor needs power of 43. 6 watt while at 600 rpm the motor needs power of 600 watt. The power consumption is also depends on the type of material, the better the mechanical properties of the materials, the higher the power consumption. For cast iron, the 400 rpm motor rotation needs power as high as 569. 7 watt. This prototype of gang drilling machine needs power of 350 watt to make five holes on teak wood while ordinary drilling machine needs total power of 1350 watt...|$|R
