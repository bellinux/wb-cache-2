25|$|In {{the period}} {{following}} the initial {{construction of the}} dam in the late 1970s, the lake began to deteriorate due to low rainfall and poor water flows, which saw lake weed overtake the swimming areas. The lake weed eventually became a drowning hazard that {{claimed the lives of}} swimmers over the preceding decade. In this sense, the project was a failure, and Lake Moana-Nui was considered unsafe. In an effort to control the problems, signs were erected banning access to the dam wall, and basic <b>handrailing</b> was put up to prevent public access. The lake was subject to regular draining in an effort to control the weed and to flush out the stale, stagnant water. While this did slightly improve the situation in the short term, people were warned not to swim in it. The lake is undergoing a major cleaning project {{so that it can be}} used in the future. To date (as at 25 April 2015), Lake Moana-Nui has been fully drained, refilled, and restored - and has been cleared by the local council for public recreation (as it was in its heyday during the 1970s and 80's).|$|E

40|$|Higginson, Jill S. Upper {{extremity}} {{movements and}} forces {{have important implications}} for rehabilitation of pathological gait. Patients with pathological gait often rely on an outside source (such as a cane or <b>handrail)</b> to assist them. It is important to take into consideration if <b>handrail</b> usage significantly alters the kinetic and kinematic data during different walking conditions because the amount of force used on the <b>handrail</b> varies between subjects and may influence these parameters. This study combined treadmill gait analysis with upper extremity force measurement on healthy subjects to provide an understanding of the changes that occur in kinetics and kinematics with <b>handrail</b> use. Objective: The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the effect of <b>handrail</b> use on the kinetics and kinematics during treadmill walking in healthy subjects. We compared (1) magnitudes of <b>handrail</b> and ground reaction forces and (2) hip angles when no <b>handrails</b> were used and when five percent of body weight was applied to the <b>handrail.</b> Methods: Twenty five healthy young adults were recruited for this study. Kinematic and kinetic data were collected while all subjects walked on an instrumented split-belt treadmill at their self-selected speed. To determine the effect of <b>handrail</b> usage on walking kinetics, subjects walked under four <b>handrail</b> conditions (no hands on <b>handrail</b> (NHR), both hands on the <b>handrail</b> (BHR), left hand only on the <b>handrail</b> (LHR), and right hand only on the <b>handrail</b> (RHR)). The subjects walked under three additional conditions to quantify changes in kinematics when <b>handrail</b> force was controlled (no hands on <b>handrail,</b> 5 % body weight (BW) on right <b>handrail,</b> and 5 % body weight on left <b>handrail).</b> Ground reaction forces and <b>handrail</b> forces as well as hip angles, trunk list and trunk tilt were analyzed. Results: The first peak of the ground reaction force was reduced significantly when both <b>handrails</b> were used. This suggests the <b>handrails</b> were used for stability during heel strike. The left and right <b>handrail</b> forces when only one <b>handrail</b> was used showed no significant differences and the right <b>handrail</b> forces in the RHR and BHR conditions also remained the same. During <b>handrail</b> force control conditions, the trunk list, in the frontal plane, and trunk tilt, in the sagittal plane, were significantly different, but the hip angles were not. Conclusions: <b>Handrail</b> use needs to be considered because it has an effect on ground reaction forces, which may influence inverse dynamics calculations. Although there were no significant differences in hip angles when a <b>handrail</b> force of 5 % BW (or less) is applied to the <b>handrails,</b> there were significant differences in trunk list and trunk tilt, which may be more pronounced with greater <b>handrail</b> forces applied. When a subject uses a <b>handrail</b> during a data collection, different <b>handrail</b> conditions and the amount of force applied to the <b>handrails</b> need to be taken into account.

In the present study, we sought to clarify the effects of <b>handrail</b> height on joint movement, center-of-gravity, and floor reaction force during sit-to-stand movement. Subjects included 16 healthy young adults and 25 older adults who require long-term care. Kinetic and kinematic measurements during sit-to-stand movement of young adults were conducted using a 3 -D motion analyzer and a force plate. Trunk forward tilt angle during sit-to-stand movement of older adults was measured using a still image from a video recording. Using low <b>handrails,</b> sit-to-stand movement resulted in an increased hip flexion angle, ankle dorsiflexion angle, and trunk forward tilt angle and a greater forward center-of-gravity shift than when not using <b>handrails</b> in young adults during seat-off. In contrast, using high <b>handrails</b> resulted in a smaller hip flexion angle and trunk forward tilt angle in young adults. The backward force on the floor was decreased in the low <b>handrail</b> condition, and was increased in the high <b>handrail</b> condition rather than that of sit-to-stand movement without <b>handrails</b> in young adults. The effect of <b>handrail</b> height on trunk forward tilt angle was the same in both healthy young adults and care-needing older adults during seat-off. Because <b>handrail</b> height affects joint movement and shift in the center-of-gravity during sit-to-stand movement, <b>handrail</b> position should be selected to match the status of older adults with functional impairment...|$|R

40|$|Background: Holding a <b>handrail</b> {{or using}} a cane may {{decrease}} the energy cost of walking in stroke survivors. However, the factors underlying this decrease {{have not yet}} been previously identified. The purpose of the current study was to fill this void by investigating the effect of physical support (through <b>handrail</b> hold) and/or somatosensory input (through light touch contact with a <b>handrail)</b> on energy cost and accompanying changes in both step parameters and neuromuscular activity. Elucidating these aspects may provide useful insights into gait recovery post stroke. Methods: Fifteen stroke survivors participated in this study. Participants walked on a treadmill under three conditions: no <b>handrail</b> contact, light touch of the <b>handrail,</b> and firm <b>handrail</b> hold. During the trials we recorded oxygen consumption, center of pressure profiles, and bilateral activation of eight lower limb muscles. Effects of the three conditions on energy cost, step parameters and neuromuscular activation were compared statistically using conventional ANOVAs with repeated measures. In order to examine to which extent energy cost and step parameters/muscle activity are associated, we further employed a partial least squares regression analysis. Results: <b>Handrail</b> hold resulted in a significant reduction in energy cost, whereas light touch contact did not. With <b>handrail</b> hold subjects took longer steps with smaller step width and improved step length symmetry, whereas light touch contact only resulted in a small but significant decrease in step width. The EMG analysis indicated a global drop in muscle activity, accompanied by an increased constancy in the timing of this activity, and a decreased co-activation with <b>handrail</b> hold, but not with light touch. The regression analysis revealed that increased stride time and length, improved step length symmetry, and decreased muscle activity were closely associated with the decreased energy cost during <b>handrail</b> hold. Conclusion: <b>Handrail</b> hold, but not light touch, altered step parameters and was accompanied by a global reduction in muscle activity, with improved timing constancy. This suggests that the use of a <b>handrail</b> allows for a more economic step pattern that requires less muscular activation without resulting in substantial neuromuscular re-organization. <b>Handrail</b> use may thus have beneficial effects on gait economy after stroke, which cannot be accomplished through enhanced somatosensory input alone...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: This project {{addressed}} an unresolved issue involving {{measurement methods}} for determining step uniformity. Leading experts on stairway safety agree {{that lack of}} step uniformity within a flight contributes to risk of missteps. A relatively new method for precisely measuring step dimensions is the nosing-to-nosing method. An issue in applying the method is lack of agreement on the lateral location to make the measurements. That location depends on where stairway users ascend and descend relative to {{the width of the}} steps. A prior investigator examined people descending to determine the lateral distance between the <b>handrail</b> center and the mid-line of the person’s body. He found the median was 44 cm. AIM: The two objectives of the experiment were to: (1) determine if a different set of stairway users will have the same median lateral distance from the <b>handrail</b> as those described in the prior observational study, and (2) determine if the lateral distance of participants is affected by their direction of travel and use of a <b>handrail.</b> METHODS: The investigators established visible distance markers on one stairway in a campus building and videotaped volunteer students ascending and descending the flight of stairs. Each of the 16 participant ascended with and without using the <b>handrail,</b> and each descended with and without using the <b>handrail.</b> Images were printed and analyzed to determine their lateral distance between the inner edge of the <b>handrail</b> and a point midway between the participant’s knees. Results were analyzed statistically to test hypotheses corresponding to the two objectives. RESULTS: The previous study found a median lateral distance of 44 cm when measured {{from the center of the}} <b>handrail.</b> Using comparable data, the median found in this study was 25 cm. Results of this study indicated that lateral distance from the <b>handrail</b> is significantly affected by the direction of travel and by use of the <b>handrail.</b> The greatest lateral distance was for ascending with the <b>handrail.</b> The shortest lateral distance was for descending without the <b>handrail.</b> VALUE: Committees develop and periodically revise standards for stairways leading to fire exits and workplace facilities.
