5|$|As {{many as half}} of all Cavalier King Charles Spaniels {{may have}} a {{congenital}} blood disorder called idiopathic asymptomatic thrombocytopenia, an abnormally low number of platelets in the blood, according to recent studies in Denmark and the United States. Platelets, or thrombocytes, are disk-shaped blood elements which aid in blood clotting. Excessively low numbers {{are the most common}} cause of bleeding disorders in dogs. The platelets in the blood of many Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are a combination of those of normal size for dogs and others that are abnormally oversized, or macrothrombocytes. Macrothrombocytosis also is a congenital abnormality found <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> third of CKCSs. These large platelets function normally, and the typical Cavalier does not appear to experience any health problems due to either the size or fewer numbers of its platelets.|$|E

25|$|In June 1938, the House Un-American Activities Committee (led by Chairman Martin Dies, Jr.) heard {{testimony}} from AFL leader John P.

Witt had extensive influence among the staff, was close to Board Member Edwin S. Smith, and had influenced procedural matters on the Board in favor of the CIO <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> few instances. Secretary Perkins prevailed upon President Roosevelt to speak with Madden, and the President demanded an impartial administration of the law.|$|E
25|$|The Smiley face murder theory (variations include Smiley face murders, Smiley face killings, Smiley face gang, and others) is {{a theory}} {{advanced}} by two retired New York City detectives, Kevin Gannon and Anthony Duarte, {{that a number of}} young men found dead in bodies of water across several Midwestern American states over the last decade did not accidentally drown, as concluded by law enforcement agencies, but were victims of a serial killer or killers. The term smiley face became connected to the alleged murders when it was made public that the police had discovered graffiti depicting a smiley face near locations where they think the killer dumped the bodies <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> dozen of the cases. The response of law enforcement investigators and other experts to Gannon and Duarte's theory has been largely skeptical.|$|E

25|$|The Indus {{script is}} the short strings of symbols {{associated}} with the Harappan civilization of ancient India (most of the Indus sites are distributed in present-day Pakistan and northwest India) used between 2600–1900 BCE, which evolved from an early Indus script attested from around 3500–3300 BCE. Found <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> dozen types of context, the symbols are most commonly associated with flat, rectangular stone tablets called seals. The first publication of a Harappan seal was a drawing by Alexander Cunningham in 1875. Since then, well over 4000 symbol-bearing objects have been discovered, some as far afield as Mesopotamia. After 1500 BCE, coinciding with {{the final stage of}} Harappan civilization, use of the symbols ends. There are over 400 distinct signs, but many are thought to be slight modifications or combinations of perhaps 200 'basic' signs. The symbols remain undeciphered (in spite of numerous attempts that did not find favour with the academic community), and some scholars classify them as proto-writing rather than writing proper.|$|E
25|$|In 1992, County Executive Andrew Spano became {{just the}} second Democrat {{to hold the}} post <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> half-century. In 2006, county {{legislator}} Andrea Stewart-Cousins defeated 20-year incumbent Nicholas Spano for {{a seat in the}} New York State Senate in a rematch of the 2004 race, which she had lost by only 18 votes. His brother, Assembly Member Mike Spano, switched parties in July 2007 to become a Democrat. Current district attorney Janet DiFiore also switched parties from Republican to Democrat in August 2007. In 2009, Republican Rob Astorino ousted three-term county executive Andy Spano, who had the endorsement of the New York Conservative Party, winning in a landslide. Astorino became the first Republican county executive since Andrew O'Rourke left the post in 1997. In 2011, the GOP broke the Democratic two-thirds majority in the county legislature by picking up two seats. The current composition is ten Democrats, six Republicans, and one Conservative who caucuses with the Republicans. However, two of the Democrats formed a coalition with the Republicans to control the board, with a Republican becoming vice-chair.|$|E
25|$|During {{the last}} decade, Philadelphia {{experienced}} a large shift in its age profile. In 2000, the city's population pyramid had a largely stationary shape. In 2013, the city {{took on an}} expansive pyramid shape, {{with an increase in}} the three millennial age groups, 20 to 24, 25 to 29, and 30 to 34. The city's 25- to 29-year-old age group was the city's largest age cohort. According to the 2010 Census, 343,837 (22.5%) were under the age of 18; 203,697 (13.3%) from 18 to 25; 434,385 (28.5%) from 25 to 44; 358,778 (23.5%) from 45 to 64; and 185,309 (12.1%) who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 33.5 years. For every 100 females there were 89.4 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 85.7 males. The city had 22,018 births in 2013, down from a peak 23,689 births in 2008. Philadelphia's death rate was at its lowest <b>in</b> <b>at</b> <b>least</b> <b>a</b> half-century, 13,691 deaths in 2013. Another factor attributing to the population increase is Philadelphia's immigration rate. In 2013, 12.7 percent of residents were foreign-born, just shy of the national average, 13.1 percent.|$|E
