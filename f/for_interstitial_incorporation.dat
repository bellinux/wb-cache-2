40|$|The {{effect of}} dopant atoms on the {{structural}} and elastic properties ofα titanium is examined {{through the use}} of density functional theory. The effect of 66 dopant atoms, from H through the third row transition metal elements, were considered in this study. In all cases the dopant concentration was approximately 3 at%, with substitutional incorporation investigated for all atoms considered and <b>interstitial</b> <b>incorporation</b> investigated <b>for</b> a smaller subset of elements. <b>Interstitial</b> <b>incorporation</b> was calculated to be more energetically favourable for the elements H, B to F, S and Cl with these dopants coordinating octahedrally with the surrounding Ti atoms, while substitutional incorporation was found to be more stable for the other elements. The ﬁve independent single crystal elastic constants are calculated, along with the bulk and shear moduli.

50|$|Methods {{have been}} devised to modify the yield strength, ductility, and {{toughness}} of both crystalline and amorphous materials. These strengthening mechanisms give engineers the ability to tailor the mechanical properties of materials to suit {{a variety of different}} applications. For example, the favorable properties of steel result from <b>interstitial</b> <b>incorporation</b> of carbon into the iron lattice. Brass, a binary alloy of copper and zinc, has superior mechanical properties compared to its constituent metals due to solution strengthening. Work hardening (such as beating a red-hot piece of metal on anvil) has also been used for centuries by blacksmiths to introduce dislocations into materials, increasing their yield strengths.|$|R

40|$|Using Raman {{spectroscopy}} we have analysed {{the strain}} status of GaN films grown on sapphire substrates by NH 3 source {{molecular beam epitaxy}} (MBE). In addition to the expected compressive biaxial strain, in some cases GaN films grown on c-face sapphire substrates suffer from serious tensile biaxial strain. This anomalous behaviour has been well interpreted in terms of interstitial hydrogen-dependent lattice dilation. The hydrogen concentration in the films is measured by nuclear reaction analysis (NRA). With increasing hydrogen incorporation, the residual compressive biaxial strain is first further relaxed, and then turns into tensile strain when the hydrogen contaminant exceeds a critical concentration. The hydrogen incorporation during the growth process {{is found to be}} growth-rate dependent, and is supposed to be strain driven. We believe that the strain-induced <b>interstitial</b> <b>incorporation</b> is another way for strain relaxation during heteroepitaxy, besides the two currently well known mechanisms: formation of dislocations and growth front roughening...|$|R
40|$|Rationale: Surgical {{lung biopsy}} {{can help to}} {{determine}} a specific diagnosis in interstitial lung disease, but has associated risks. Most currently available mortality data are derived from case series {{and may not be}} generalizable to broader populations. Objectives: We aimed to assess in-hospital mortality following surgical lung biopsy <b>for</b> <b>interstitial</b> lung disease in a national secondary care dataset from the United States. Methods: Data were obtained from the 2000 - 2011 Nationwide Inpatient Sample. Cases were identified using International Classification of Diseases (ICD- 9 -CM) codes <b>for</b> <b>interstitial</b> lung disease and surgical lung biopsies. Lung resections and cases of lung cancer were excluded. Weighted data were used to estimate numbers of biopsies nationwide and in-hospital mortality, and multivariable logistic regression was used to adjust for sex, age, geographic region, co-morbidity, type of operation and provisional diagnosis. Measurements and Main Results: We estimated there to be around 12, 000 surgical lung biopsies performed annually <b>for</b> <b>interstitial</b> lung disease in the United States, two-thirds of which were performed electively.

3000|$|It is {{well know}} that in ZnO lattice matrix {{nitrogen}} impurities act as acceptors [22],[23]. In this view, various groups have adopted nitrogen as doping agent {{for the development of}} p-type ZnO films and also nanostructures [24]-[28]. In general, upon increasing plasma exposure time, the amount of nitrogen implantation or absorption in ZnO NRs increases. The incorporation of nitrogen into ZnO NR structures probably occurs in two ways: interstitial and substitutional doping. As interstitial doping, the nitrogen atoms neutralize the defect states present on the surface of ZnO materials, whereas in substitutional doping, nitrogen impurities generate interstitial defects (OI) by replacing oxygen atoms. Usually, the electrical conductivity of ZnO primarily dominated by electrons generated from oxygen vacancies and zinc interstitial atoms [29],[30]. In the present case, the <b>interstitial</b> <b>incorporation</b> of nitrogen atoms in place of oxygen vacancies (VO) [11],[13] diminish the existing defects states due to passivation, and leads the density of carriers to lower values. Thus, the defects related BB peak intensity strongly reduced. Further, the decrease of carrier density leads band gap of ZnO NRs to lower values since Eg α ni [...]...|$|R
