5|$|The {{southern}} of the NC's two extensions {{was planned}} {{to connect with}} the BS tunnels under Belvedere Road to the west of Waterloo station and head east under the mainline station to its own station under Sandell Street adjacent to Waterloo East station. The route was then planned to run under Waterloo Road, St George's Circus and London Road to Elephant and Castle. The route then followed New Kent Road and Old Kent Road as far as the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's Old Kent Road station (closed in 1917). Intermediate stations were to be constructed at St George's Circus, Elephant and Castle (where the NC station would interchange with the C's station below ground and link to the London, Chatham and Dover Railway's station above ground), in New Kent Road at Munton Road, at the junction of New Kent Road and Old Kent Road, and on Old Kent Road at the junctions with Mina Road, Bowles Road and Commercial Road (now Commercial Way). A power station was planned {{on the south side of}} Old Kent Road where it crossed the Grand Surrey Canal (now filled-in) at the junction with St James's Road. This would have provided a delivery route for fuel and a source of water. Tunnels were also planned to connect the BS's proposed depot at Waterloo to the NC's route enabling trains to enter and exit <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E

25|$|Minerals {{with many}} {{cleavages}} might not break equally well {{in all of}} the directions; for example, calcite has good cleavage in three direction, but gypsum has perfect cleavage in one direction, and poor cleavage in two other directions. Angles between cleavage planes vary between minerals. For example, as the amphiboles are double-chain silicates and the pyroxenes are single-chain silicates, the angle between their cleavage planes is different. The pyroxenes cleave <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> at approximately 90°, whereas the amphiboles distinctively cleave <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> separated by approximately 120° and 60°. The cleavage angles can be measured with a contact goniometer, which is similar to a protractor.|$|E

The conductance and its distribution <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> {{are found to}} be approximately the same, once the dimension of the system in each direction is chosen to be proportional to the localization length. At the localization}delocalization transition under a strong magnetic "eld, the geometrical mean of the conductance <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> is not universal.

40|$|In image processing, {{enhancement}} of conjugate linear features on an image is required sometimes. This enhancement {{can be achieved}} by using <b>two</b> directional filters <b>in</b> <b>two</b> specific conjugate <b>directions.</b> Traditionally the filtered data from the <b>two</b> conjugate <b>directions</b> are presented <b>in</b> <b>two</b> separate images. This is inconvenient for making a direct comparison between linear features <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> conjugate <b>directions.</b> We recently proposed a new method named the modified conjugate directional filtering (MCDF) to combine <b>two</b> direction-filtered results <b>in</b> <b>two</b> conjugate <b>directions</b> into one image that retains the maximum information of the linear features <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> conjugate <b>directions.</b> Since conjugated features are often seen on remote sensing images, in this paper we present a few cases in using the MCDF to enhance the conjugated features on some remote sensing images. These examples show that the MCDF is a useful tool for linear feature enhancement not only <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> selected <b>directions,</b> but <b>in</b> other directions as wel...|$|R

25|$|Immediately {{after this}} war the French art scene diverged roughly <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions.</b> There {{were those who}} {{continued}} in the artistic experiments from before the war, especially surrealism, and others who adopted the new Abstract Expressionism and action painting from New York, executing them in a French manner using Tachism or L'art informel.

25|$|If the {{principal}} curvatures have different signs: , then the Gaussian curvature is negative {{and the surface}} {{is said to have}} a hyperbolic or saddle point. At such points, the surface will be saddle shaped. Because one principal curvature is negative, one is positive, and the normal curvature varies continuously if you rotate a plane orthogonal to the surface around the normal to the surface <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions,</b> the normal curvatures will be zero giving the Asymptotic curves for that point.|$|E

On the one hand, there was an attempt at recovering the English literature of the Jacobean period, as {{if there had been}} no disruption; but, on the other, there was a powerful sense of novelty, and authors approached Gallic models of literature and elevated the literature of wit (particularly satire and parody). The novelty would show in the literature of sceptical inquiry, and the Gallicism would show in the introduction of Neoclassicism into English writing and criticism.|$|E

The earliest recorded slave presence was about 1748 in Hampshire County on the estate of Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron, which included 150 slaves. By the early 19th century, slavery had spread to the Ohio River up to the northern panhandle.|$|E

25|$|This {{definition}} can {{be understood}} <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions,</b> both of which give rise to whole new domains of mathematics. On the one hand, it may yield new information about the group G: often, the group operation in G is abstractly given, but via ρ, it corresponds to the multiplication of matrices, which is very explicit. On the other hand, given a well-understood group acting on a complicated object, this simplifies {{the study of the}} object in question. For example, if G is finite, it is known that V above decomposes into irreducible parts. These parts in turn are much more easily manageable than the whole V (via Schur's lemma).|$|E
25|$|The Hudson Bay {{watershed}} drains over a {{third of}} Canada. It covers Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec, most of Saskatchewan, southern Alberta, southwestern Nunavut and the southern half of Baffin Island. This basin is most important in fighting drought in the prairies and producing hydroelectricity, especially in Manitoba, northern Ontario and Quebec. Major elements of this watershed include Lake Winnipeg, Nelson River, the North Saskatchewan and South Saskatchewan Rivers, Assiniboine River, and Nettilling Lake on Baffin Island. Wollaston Lake lies on the boundary between the Hudson Bay and Arctic Ocean watersheds and drains into both. It is the largest lake in the world that naturally drains <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions.</b>|$|E
25|$|Heavier {{artillery}} {{was initially}} installed in open positions. 150mm Krupp field guns were installed in open emplacements in 1894, allowing fire <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions.</b> Battery C15 {{was placed on}} the ridge between Righi and the Aiguille, firing north and south. Battery C10 with two 105mm guns and the Batterie Aiguille with the same equipment were placed near the summit. The Batterie de l'Observatoire, located above the Galerie des Mordes, was equipped with four 120mm guns. The Batterie Rossignol placed two 120mm pieces each facing north and south, while the Batterie de Plan 2 and the Batterie de Righi each mounted two 120mm pieces. These were replaced in 1923 by Model 1912 120mm howitzers with a higher rate of fire.|$|E

40|$|The {{analysis}} of rectangular two-way slabs subjected to concentrated load uniformly distributed over defined area after dispersion down <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> to the reinforcement is a practically important case. As presented by Egyptian code for {{design and construction}} of concrete structures ECCS 203 - 2007, the {{analysis of}} this problem can be performed by using the elastic analysis or by using an approximate method which depends {{on the distribution of}} the concentrated load <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> by the ratio of the long length and short length of the rectangular slab. Significant differences between the results of these methods must take our attention. An alternative approximate method for determining the bending moments of the slab under study <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> is investigated <b>in</b> this paper based on the elastic analysis. Two closed-form expressions were obtained which describe the relation between the bending moments and all factors that affect it (the span ratio, the dimensions ratio of the loaded area and the ratio between the short span to the parallel length of the loaded area). Comparisons between the straining actions <b>in</b> the <b>two</b> <b>directions</b> resulting from the present analysis and these from the existing approximate method of the ECCS 203 - 2007 with those obtained by international codes as British Standards BS 8110 and those obtained by finite element method are given also in this paper...|$|R

Initially, the Italian offensive enjoyed a limited level of success. The French defensive lines on the Italian border were weakened due to French High Command shuffling forces to fight the Germans. Some French mountain units {{had been sent to}} Norway. However, the Italian offensive soon stalled at the fortified Alpine Line in the Alps region and {{at the southern end of}} the Maginot Line in the Mediterranean region. The attack through the Little Saint Bernard Pass in the Alps had to stop due to a massive snow storm.|$|E
25|$|In early August, Banks' corps, {{now part}} of Maj. Gen. John Pope's Army of Virginia, was {{stationed}} at Culpeper, Virginia. With reports of Jackson's Confederate troops marching in their direction, the 46th {{and the rest of}} their brigade under Brig. Gen. Samuel W. Crawford were ordered to attack them near a promontory named Cedar Mountain. Advancing across a wheat field, Crawford's brigade smashed into the left of Jackson's line and collapsed elements of two brigades there, including the vaunted Stonewall Brigade. During the confusion of battle, the 46th split <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>directions,</b> with the right half engaging the right flank of the Stonewall Brigade, and the left half tangling with the left end of Brig. Gen. Richard B. Garnett's brigade. The fighting here was close and savage, including hand-to-hand combat. However, with no Union reinforcements immediately sent to sustain this breakthrough, and with pressure from additional Rebel troops sent to shore up and rally this end of the line, Crawford's men were soon outflanked and forced to retreat back across the wheat field.|$|E
