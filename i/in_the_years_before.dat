Those years saw the opening of many education institutions such as Morehouse College (1867), Clark College (1869), Spelman College (1881), Morris Brown College (1882), Georgia School of Technology (now known as the Georgia Institute of Technology) (1885), and Agnes Scott College (1890). John B. Gordon, a distinguished Confederate general, was Governor of Georgia.|$|E
5|$|Maple {{syrup and}} maple sugar were {{used during the}} American Civil War and by abolitionists <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the war because most cane sugar and {{molasses}} were produced by Southern slaves. Because of food rationing during the Second World War, people in the northeastern United States were encouraged to stretch their sugar rations by sweetening foods with maple syrup and maple sugar, and recipe books were printed to help housewives employ this alternative source.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the work}} of Henry of Huntingdon, who wrote <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> 1154 and who {{regarded}} Stephen's actions as treachery against the clergy that earned him punishment from God, Alexander's arrest has been seen by many historians as {{a turning point in}} Stephen's reign. Writing in the 1870s, the historian William Stubbs felt that the arrest destroyed the royal administration, but modern historians have advanced differing explanations for the troubles that followed, not all of which are related to the bishop's arrest.|$|E

5|$|Sir John Frederick Neville Cardus, CBE (3 April 188828 February 1975) was an English {{writer and}} critic. From an impoverished home background, and mainly self-educated, he became The Manchester Guardians cricket {{correspondent}} in 1919 and its chief music critic in 1927, holding the two posts simultaneously until 1940. His contributions {{to these two}} distinct fields <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the Second World War established his {{reputation as one of}} the foremost critics of his generation.|$|E
5|$|Though Jane {{never used}} her {{connection}} with Shelley to gain any publicity, she did entertain prominent admirers and biographers of Shelley, including George Eliot and William Michael Rossetti. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Hogg's death, a nephew of Jane's, one of John Cleveland's seven children, {{came to live}} with them after leaving the military due to an illness. Jane and her nephew, Harry Cleveland, became close friends and he began to run her household as she grew older. In her later years, Jane often read novels, played the piano, and spent time with Harry's daughter and her grandchildren.|$|E
5|$|Bax {{was born}} in the London suburb of Streatham to a prosperous family. He was {{encouraged}} by his parents to pursue a career in music, and his private income enabled him to follow his own path as a composer without regard for fashion or orthodoxy. Consequently, he came to be regarded in musical circles as an important but isolated figure. While still a student at the Royal Academy of Music Bax became fascinated with Ireland and Celtic culture, which became a strong influence on his early development. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the First World War he lived in Ireland and became a member of Dublin literary circles, writing fiction and verse under the pseudonym Dermot O'Byrne. Later, he developed an affinity with Nordic culture, which for a time superseded his Celtic influences in the years after the First World War.|$|E

5|$|By {{the middle}} of the 12th century the former {{territory}} of the kingdom of the Rhinns was part of Galloway kingdom, but the area to the north was not. Strathgryfe, Kyle and Cunningham had come {{under the control of the}} Scottish king in the early 12th century, much of it given over to soldiers of French or Anglo-French origin. Strathgryfe and most of Kyle had been given to Walter fitz Alan under King David I, with Hugh de Morville taking Cunningham. Strathnith still had a Gaelic ruler (ancestor of the famous Thomas Randolph, 1st Earl of Moray), but he was not part of the kingdom of Galloway. The rest of the region—the Rhinns, Farines, Carrick, Desnes Mór and Desnes Ioan, and the sparsely settled uplands of Glenken—was probably under the control of the sons of Fergus, King of Galloway, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> Donnchadh's career in the region.|$|E
5|$|Concerns {{were raised}} about {{these changes in}} society. William Langland wrote the poem Piers Plowman <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> 1380, praising peasants who {{respected}} the law and worked hard for their lords, but complaining about greedy, travelling labourers demanding higher wages. The poet John Gower feared England might see an uprising similar to the French Jacquerie revolt of 1358, in which the peasants had risen up against their masters. There was a moral panic about {{the threat posed by}} newly arrived workers in the towns and the possibility that servants might turn against their masters. New legislation was introduced in 1359 to deal with migrants, existing conspiracy laws were more widely applied and the treason laws were extended to include servants or wives who betrayed their masters and husbands. By the 1370s, there were fears that if the French invaded England, the rural classes might side with the invaders.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{efforts to}} revive {{interest}} in the breed, numbers steadily declined <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> 1988. In 1995, there were 33 stallions in service; in 1996 this number remained the same and by 1998 it had declined to 30. In 2004, there were 111 breeders and 119 Trait du Nord foals were registered. By 2007 and 2008 there were only 17 stallions registered, a number which is exposing the breed to a dangerous increase in inbreeding. To combat this danger, farmers are cross breeding the Trait du Nord with approved Belgian and Dutch horses. The number of farmers breeding the Trait du Nord decreased from 150 to 125 in 2002, then to 92 in 2007 and 86 in 2008. After birth rates remained relatively steady in the 1990s, they began to drop in the 2000s, declining from 176 in 2000 to 100 in 2005 and just 75 in 2007.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the efforts}} of the {{compulsory}} training scheme <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the war, very few of the men who served in the AN had had previous military experience. It had been hastily equipped and received only rudimentary training prior to its departure within days of its formation. During the stop over at Palm Island the men went ashore almost every day, and although the shingle beach, rocky ground and bush made the terrain unsuited to tactical manoeuvres, they were able to practice maintaining contact in dense jungle, a skill which later proved important during the fighting at Bita Paka. Yet, with the force remaining at Palm Island for only a week this training was limited and was unlikely to have adequately prepared the force if it were more seriously tested. Ultimately though this lack of training did not end up being costly as German resistance proved only limited, with the fighting over in less than a day and resulting in fewer than a dozen Australian casualties.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{distributed}} element filters began <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> World WarII. A major {{paper on}} the subject was published by Mason and Sykes in 1937. Mason had filed a patent much earlier, in 1927, and that patent may contain the first published design which moves away from a lumped element analysis. Mason and Sykes' work {{was focused on the}} formats of coaxial cable and balanced pairs of wires – the planar technologies were not yet in use. Much development was carried out during the war years driven by the filtering needs of radar and electronic counter-measures. A good deal of this was at the MIT Radiation Laboratory, but other laboratories in the US and the UK were also involved.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, {{with the}} thawing of Sino-Indian relations, Indian Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee's visit to China {{led to the}} {{resumption}} of talks on opening the border. Later in 2004, the Indian Defence Minister's visit to China led to the formal opening of the pass. The opening, originally scheduled for 2 October 2005, was postponed due to last-minute infrastructure problems on the Chinese side. Finally, {{after a decade of}} talks, Nathu La was opened on 6 July 2006. The date of the reopening, which also formally recognised Tibet as part of China by India and Sikkim's accession to India, coincided with the birthday of the reigning Dalai Lama. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the reopening, the only person permitted to cross the barbed-wire frontier had been a Chinese postman with an Indian military escort, who would hand over mail to his Indian counterpart in a building at the border.|$|E

30|$|As {{might be}} {{expected}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Australian ECEC system, and also illustrated by LSAC and other Australian attendance data, younger children {{are less likely to}} attend programs (as also indicated in Table  1) and attend for fewer hours; for example, fewer than half the children attend 4  years of ECEC before school compared to over 90 % of children <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> school and <b>the</b> average weekly hours of attendance increase from about 22  h per week 4  years before school entry to about 26  h per week <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>year</b> <b>before</b> school.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> federation, {{the colonial}} {{government}} recognised that British education and indigenous culture was influencing {{a new generation}} of Iban teachers. Thus, on 15 September 1958, the Borneo Literature Bureau was inaugurated with a charter to nurture and encourage local literature while also supporting the government in its release of documentation, particularly in technical and instructional manuscripts that were to be distributed to the indigenous peoples of Sarawak and Sabah. As well as indigenous languages, documents would also be published in English, Chinese and Malay. In 1977, the bureau came under the authority of the federal government language planning and development agency, the Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka (DBP), which advocated publication only in Malay ultimately causing the demise of fledgling indigenous literature.|$|E
5|$|The Jersey Act's major {{effect was}} the {{opposite}} of what was intended. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the Second World War, British and Irish breeders had relied on imported Thoroughbreds from France to enrich their breeding lines, a source that was unavailable during the war, and concerns were beginning to be expressed that the situation might lead to excessive inbreeding. Additionally, {{by the end of the}} war American-bred lines were some of the most successful racing lines in the world, effectively making the British and Irish breeding programmes that did not use them second-rate, and harming the rebuilding of English racing. There were even calls for the creation of an international stud book to record all Thoroughbred pedigrees, thus eliminating any perceived slight on the bloodlines that were excluded from the General Stud Book.|$|E
5|$|The Palais Rohan {{remained}} the hôtel de ville until 1805. That year, the municipality {{presented it to}} Napoleon, who returned the Hôtel deHanau in exchange. Like the palace, the hôtel had been state-owned since the Revolution. The 1805 arrangement proved favourable for the municipality: {{the maintenance of the}} Hôtel deHanau was less costly than that of the larger Palais Rohan. It pleased Napoleon, for whom the palace was the more conspicuous display of grandeur. As for the palace, imperial ownership meant renewed splendour. The present to Napoleon was officially accepted by decree on 21January 1806; the interiors were then refurbished by the architect Pierre-François-Léonard Fontaine. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>before</b> the Franco-Prussian War and the return of Alsace to Germany, the Palais Rohan was the property of the French state, which was in turn an empire, a kingdom, a monarchy, a republic, and again an empire.|$|E
