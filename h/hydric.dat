25|$|The city of Sun Prairie {{encounters}} occasional flooding {{because of}} the presence of <b>hydric</b> soils, spring melting and its proximity to the Koshkonong Creek. This condition is compounded by storm water runoff from development and urbanization in the upper reaches of the watershed. Many residents of the city believe that the problems with flooding are worsening, becoming more frequent over the last 14 years.|$|E
25|$|Metallothionein gene {{expression}} is induced {{by a high}} variety of stimuli, as metal exposure, oxidative stress, glucocorticoids, Vitamin D, <b>hydric</b> stress, etc. The level of the response to these inducers depends on the MT gene. MT genes present in their promotors specific sequences for the regulation of the expression, elements as metal response elements (MRE), glucocorticoid response elements (GRE), GC-rich boxes, basal level elements (BLE), and thyroid response elements (TRE).|$|E
2500|$|Using {{chemical}} nomenclature, various {{names for}} water are in common use within the scientific community. Some such names include hydrogen oxide, {{as well as}} an alkali name of hydrogen hydroxide, and several acid names such as <b>hydric</b> acid, hydroxic acid, hydroxyl acid, and hydroxilic acid. The term [...] "hydroxyl acid" [...] used in the original text is a non-standard name.|$|E
2500|$|Sebastopol meadowfoam is {{endemic to}} a narrow region within Sonoma County, {{occurring}} only at elevations less than 300 meters above mean sea level. The occurrences are limited to the upper and central reaches of the Laguna de Santa Rosa {{and parts of the}} Americano Creek and Washoe Creek watersheds, which drain to the Pacific Ocean. L. vinculans is found primarily in vernal pools associated with the generally level to slightly sloping terrain. Typically the herb is found in <b>hydric</b> soils associations, and is often found in joint occurrence with the endangered Burke's goldfields (Lasthenia burkei) and Sonoma sunshine (Blennosperma bakeri) [...] The Santa Rosa plain vernal pools occur primarily as fragmented remains of Valley Oak Woodland, grassland, and persistent wetland vegetation.|$|E
5000|$|Another common {{definition}} of a <b>hydric</b> soils {{is provided by the}} National Technical Committee of <b>Hydric</b> Soils (NTCHS) as [...] "a soil that formed under conditions of saturation, flooding, or ponding long enough during the growing season to develop anaerobic conditions in the upper part."

50|$|<b>Hydric</b> hammocks, {{also known}} as low hammocks, wetland {{hardwood}} hammocks, or lowland oak hammocks, grow on soils that are poorly drained or that have high water tables, subject to occasional flooding. They are usually found on gentle slopes just above swamps, marshes or wet prairies. <b>Hydric</b> hammocks are found in scattered locations in Florida north of Lake Okeechobee, with concentrations along the upper St. Johns River, the Atlantic coast of northeastern Florida, and particularly along the Big Bend section of the Gulf Coast of Florida, from Aripeka to St. Marks.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>hydric</b> soil {{is defined}} by federal law to mean [...] "soil that, in its {{undrained}} condition, is saturated, flooded, or ponded long enough during a growing season to develop an anerobic condition that supports the growth and regeneration of hydrophytic vegetation". This term {{is part of the}} legal definition of a wetland included in the United States Food Security Act of 1985 (P.L. 99-198). This definition is provided in the controlling regulations to the Wetland Conservation Provisions of the FSA of 1985(7 C.F.R 12) and is used by the U.S.D.A. Natural Resources Conservation Service in the administration of the Wetland Conservation Compliance provisions ("Swampbuster") contained in the FSA of 1985. In adopting this definition in 1985, Congress attempted to capture the duration of waterlogged condition of a <b>hydric</b> soil by adding that a <b>hydric</b> soil is waterlogged long enough to support not only the growth of plants adapted to life in anaerobic conditions but also the regeneration of such plants.|$|E
50|$|Wetlands {{are areas}} of land {{submerged}} in water near both terrestrial and aquatic systems. They are highly diverse and are classified by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service into five categories: “The term wetland includes {{a variety of}} areas that {{fall into one of}} five categories: (1) areas with hydrophytes and <b>hydric</b> soils, such as those commonly known as marshes, swamps, and bogs; (2) areas without hydrophytes but with <b>hydric</b> soils - for example, flats where drastic fluctuation in water level, wave action, turbidity, or high concentration of salts may prevent the growth of hydrophytes; (3) areas with hydrophytes but nonhydric soils, such as margins of impoundments or excavations where hydrophytes have become established but <b>hydric</b> soils have not yet developed; (4) areas without soils but with hydrophytes such as the seaweed-covered portion of rocky shores; and (5) wetlands without soil and without hydrophytes, such as gravel beaches or rocky shores without vegetation”.|$|E

50|$|Entisols are {{the typical}} sandhill soil, deep well-drained and {{nutrient}} poor. In Florida, sandhills receive 130 cm cm of rainfall per year, {{just like the}} more <b>hydric</b> ecosystems surrounding them. Sandhills are xeric because they have poor water holding capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Wade Hurt teaches <b>hydric</b> soils {{classes for}} soil science {{undergraduate}} and graduate {{students as well as}} environmental professionals. Classes teach theoretical, morphologic, and regulatory criteria used for delineating wetlands, siting septic drain fields and identifying seasonal high water table elevation.|$|E
50|$|The plants {{found in}} <b>hydric</b> soils often have aerenchyma, {{internal}} spaces in stems and rhizomes, that allow atmospheric oxygen {{to be transported}} to the rooting zone. Hence, many wetlands are dominated by plants with aerenchyma; common examples include cattails, sedges and water-lilies.|$|E
50|$|Frenchman's Forest Natural Area is a 158 acre {{protected}} area of pine flatwoods, strand swamp, scrubby flatwoods, <b>hydric</b> hammock tidal swamp and wet flatwoods in Palm Beach Gardens, Florida.

5000|$|Maritime hammocks, {{also known}} as {{maritime}} forests or coastal hammocks, are found on stable sand dunes away from the beach on barrier islands, and on small islands in salt marshes. They are found all along the Atlantic Coast and Gulf Coast of the United States. Some authorities classify coastal hammocks as <b>hydric</b> hammocks.|$|E
50|$|Further, {{considering}} {{the definition of}} wetlands given by Cowden in 1979 for classification of wetlands in the US, three key attributes of hydrology (the degree of flooding or soil saturation), wetland vegetation (hydrophytes) and <b>hydric</b> soils have also been considered for identification. In this list, mangroves are not included since it falls under a separate category.|$|E
50|$|Four mascarons {{formerly}} dumped {{water into}} the main basin; they were removed in the 19th century, {{probably due to the}} scarcity of the incoming water, that could have left them dry. In fact the fountain has been without water for long time, but in the last years the <b>hydric</b> provision, though quite scarce, has been restored.|$|E
