40|$|Despite {{decades of}} research, solar cell {{efficiencies}} {{struggle to get}} higher than 25 %. This is due to two fundamental losses in the device: thermalization of high energy photons and transmission of low energy photons. In this work, we demonstrate efforts to improve both these losses, which, when fully realized, could increase power efficiencies to 35 % or higher. First, we utilize singlet exciton fission as a downconverting layer. Singlet exciton fission is {{a process in which}} a single high energy exciton fissions into two excitons of half the energy. Here, we first demonstrate the potential of singlet fission in an all-organic solar cell. We measure an EQE as high as 109 %, breaking the conventional limit of 100 %. We utilize the magnetic field effect of fission to characterize and quantize the fission yield in these devices, demonstrating that an increase in absorption should lead to even higher EQE values. Next, we utilize an optical light trapping scheme to increase the absorption, driving the EQE as high as 126 % with no external optics. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to orthogonalize singlet fission from the normal OPV functions such as absorption and charge transport with a small interfacial layer of a <b>fission</b> <b>material.</b> With the efficiency of singlet fission established, we then demonstrate how it can be utilized by building an optical downconverter with tetracene as the <b>fission</b> <b>material</b> and PbS colloidal nanocrystals as the acceptor. We demonstrate that low energy excitons generated in the <b>fission</b> <b>material</b> transfer to the nanocrystal with 90 % efficiency before fluorescing. This fluorescence will be able to transfer energy to inorganic solar cells such as silicon. To combat the transmission loss, we turn to the reverse process of singlet fission: triplet-triplet annihilation. We utilize colloidal nanocrystals as the sensitizer and rubrene as the annihilator. The use of colloidal nanocrystals as the sensitizer allows us to minimize energetic loss and extend deeper into the infrared as compared to state of the art devices, while allowing for facile construction of a solid state geometry. We characterize this process and demonstrate the potential it holds for future solar cells. Finally, we characterize the charge transfer state in organic solar cells. We demonstrate that intersystem crossing plays a key role, defining device performance and recombination. We further show that these states are mobile and can diffuse via an 'inchworm' hopping motion. by Daniel Norbert Congreve. Thesis: Ph.

40|$|The {{separation}} of chromophore absorption and excitonic processes, such as singlet exciton fission and photoluminescence, offers several advantages {{to the design}} of organic solar cells and luminescent solar concentrators (LSCs) for the end goal of achieving a lower cost solar energy generation. This thesis explores three new device architectures to overcome limited solar absorption in singlet-exciton-fission based solar cells and neodymium based LSCs. The process of singlet exciton fission is de-coupled from photon absorption, exciton diffusion, and charge transport in singlet-exciton-fission based solar cells by inserting a singlet <b>fission</b> <b>material</b> at the donor-acceptor interface of an organic solar cell. Singlet excitons generated in the singlet exciton donor are transferred to the singlet <b>fission</b> <b>material</b> through near field energy transfer. In this device structure, the singlet donor can be chosen for high photon absorption, exciton diffusion, and charge transport, and the singlet fission sensitizer can be selected for high singlet fission efficiency. We demonstrated a doubling of the external quantum efficiency from 12. 8 % to 27. 6 % in a singlet donor (TPTPA) through the introduction of thin film singlet fission sensitizer (rubrene) for high efficiency organic solar cells. To reduce the cost of electricity generated by sunlight via LSC systems, replacing the expensive high efficiency visible photovoltaic (PV) elements with cheap, high efficiency, earth abundant near-infrared PV elements made with silicon. This requires replacing within the LSC the visible emitting chromophores with near infrared emitters. Here, we present the use of a lanthanide ion, neodymium [...] colloidal nanocrystal energy cascade system as a promising LSC emitter scheme for the silicon spectral region. Peak optical quantum efficiencies of 43 % in a Nd³+:glass based LSC are demonstrated with simulated high geometric gain performance. With cascade energy transfer, the optical quantum efficiency in the visible of a Nd³+:glass is significantly improved with peak efficiency of 28 %. The enhanced solar absorption of Nd³+:glass through cascade energy transfer can be extended into the infrared with more optimal sensitizers. The idea of directly converting broad-band solar radiation into coherent and narrow-band laser radiation could enable many attractive technologies for solar energy. Here, we present an architecture for solar pumped lasers that uses a luminescent solar concentrator to decouple the conventional trade-off between solar absorption efficiency and the mode volume of the optical gain material. We report a 750 -[mu]m-thick Nd³+-doped YAG planar waveguide sensitized by a luminescent CdSe/CdZnS (core/shell) colloidal nanocrystal, yielding a peak cascade energy transfer of 14 %, a broad spectral response in the visible portion of the solar spectrum, and an equivalent quasi-CW solar lasing threshold of 20 W-cm 2, or approximately 200 suns. The efficient coupling of incoherent, spectrally broad sunlight in small gain volumes should allow the generation of coherent laser light from intensities of less than 100 suns. by Philip David Reusswig.

40|$|In this paper, the zero-power {{behavior}} of circulating fuel reactors (CFRs) {{has been investigated}} {{by means of a}} zero-dimensional neutron kinetics model that provides a simplified but useful approach to the simulation of the dynamics of this class of nuclear reactors. Among CFRs, the most promising is the molten salt reactor (MSR), {{which is one of the}} six innovative concepts of reactor proposed by the “Generation IV International Forum” for future nuclear energy supply. One of the key features of CFRs is represented by the <b>fission</b> <b>material,</b> which is dissolved in a liquid mixture that serves both as fuel and coolant. This causes a relevant coupling between neutronics and thermo-hydrodynamics, so that fuel velocity plays a relevant role in determining the dynamic performance of such systems. In the present study, a preliminary model has been developed that is based on the zero-power kinetics equations (i. e., reactivity feedbacks due to temperature change are neglected), modified in order to take into account the effects of the molten salt circulation on the drift of delayed neutron precursors. The system dynamic behavior has been analyzed using the theory of linear systems, and the transfer functions of the neutron density with respect to both reactivity and fuel velocity have been calculated. The developed model has been assessed on the basis of the available experimental data from the molten salt reactor experiment (MSRE) provided by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The results of the present work show that the developed simplified theoretical model is well descriptive of the MSRE zero-power dynamics, allowing a preliminary evaluation of the effects due to the circulation of the fuel salt on the neutronics of the system. Moreover, the model is of general validity for any kind of CFRs, and hence is applicable to study other MSR concepts in order to have some indications on the control strategy to be adopted in the MSR development envisaged by Generation IV...|$|E
40|$|As human’s global energy {{consumption}} increases, reaching 17. 5 TW annually in 2012, {{and continues to}} grow, the need for improved efficiencies of current renewable energy sources, such as solar energy, becomes vital. A majority of solar photons that are absorbed by photovoltaic cells are higher in energy than the bandgap material and lose that excess energy as heat. Singlet fission is a multi-electron process which fissions one excited singlet state into two separate triplet states. Incorporating singlet fission materials into a photovoltaic cell is one route to improving the efficiency of photovoltaic cells. An ideal singlet fission molecule {{for use in a}} photovoltaic cell requires three distinct improvements over current candidates: (1) increased photostability given the nature of photovoltaics and their constant exposure to sunlight, (2) increased triplet energy level so as to facilitate energy transfer at the silicon bandgap and (3) high singlet fission efficiencies. For these reasons, the rylene family with its reputation for photostability and multiple candidates with suitable energetics for singlet fission is explored in this work. Ultrafast time resolved optical spectroscopy methods are used to study two rylene candidates: peropyrene and diindenoperylene. The crystal structure of solid peropyrene consists of a herringbone arrangement of -stacked molecular pairs and diindenoperylene’s crystal structure consists of edge-to-face herringbone arrangement. We find no evidence for rapid singlet fission in the peropyrene crystals, due to the large shift of the singlet state to lower energy where it no longer fulfills the energy condition for singlet fission. Additionally, no evidence for singlet fission is found in diindenoperylene for which singlet fission would be 2, 000 cm- 1 uphill.

Results are based on different analytical techniques, i. e. gamma spectrometry, alpha spectrometry, ICP-MS, SEM with EDX and different sediment models, i. e. (CRS, CIC). The scope of the thesis is the study of hot particles. Studies on these have shown several interesting features, e. g. that they carry most of the activity dispersed from the accident, moreover, they have been very useful in the determination of the source term for the Thule accident debris. Paper I, is an overview of the results from the Thule- 97 expedition. This paper concerns the marine environment, i. e. water, sediment and benthic animals in the Bylot Sound. The main conclusions are; that plutonium is not transported from the contaminated sediments into the surface water in this shelf sea, the debris has been efficiently buried in the sediment to great depth as a result of biological activity and transfer of plutonium to benthic biota is low. Paper II, concludes that the resuspension of accident debris on land has been limited and indications were, that americium has a faster transport mechanism from the catchment area to lakes than plutonium and radio lead. Paper III, is a method description of inventory calculation techniques in sediment with heterogeneous activity concentration, i. e. hot particles are present in the samples.

40|$|Lead sulfide {{colloidal}} {{quantum dots}} (PbS QDs) possess a uniquely tunable set of electronic properties that has generated considerable {{interest in their}} use as active materials in lightweight, flexible, solution-processed photovoltaics. The bandgap of PbS QDs can be tuned across the entire range relevant for solar cells through modification of the QD size, {{and a range of}} other QD electronic properties can be modified through control of the chemical ligands bound to the QD surface. In this thesis we demonstrate how control of the energy level profile within PbS QD solar cells can be used to understand and improve their operation. First, we demonstrate that improvements in power conversion efficiency may be attained for ZnO / PbS QD heterojunction photovoltaics through the incorporation of a MoO 3 interlayer between the PbS QD film and the top-contact anode. The deep-work-function MoO 3 layer mitigates a Schottky junction that would otherwise form at the PbS / anode interface, resulting in performance improvements for devices employing a range of different anode materials. Then, we demonstrate how the tunable bandgap of PbS QDs can be used to elucidate charge- and exciton-transfer processes within hybrid organic /QD photovoltaic devices that demonstrate singlet exciton fission. We find that PbS QDs can accept electrons from triplets generated by singlet fission in pentacene and act as low-bandgap light absorbers complementary to the singlet <b>fission</b> <b>material,</b> and we explore the dependence of the triplet dissociation process on the energy levels of the QDs. Finally, we show that the energy levels of lead sulfide QDs, measured by ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy, shift by up to 0. 9 eV between different chemical ligand treatments. The directions of these energy shifts match the results of density functional theory calculations and scale with the ligand dipole moment, and trends in the performance of photovoltaic devices employing ligand-modified QD films are consistent with the measured energy level shifts. These studies identify energy level shifts resulting from interface modification, QD bandgap modification through size control, and ligand-induced surface dipoles as means of predictably controlling the electronic properties of colloidal QD films and as versatile adjustable parameters in the performance optimization of QD optoelectronic devices. by Patrick Richard Brown.

E₃₇ is assigned to the Sb donor-vacancy associate (E-center) and is the only vacancy containing defect giving an estimate of 2 x 10 ¹¹ cm-³ Mrad-¹ for the uncorrelated vacancy-interstitial pair introduction rate. E₃₇ decays by dissociation and vacancy diffusion to a sink present in a concentration of 10 ¹² cm-³. The remaining three defect states are interstitial associates and transform among one another. Conversion ratios between E₂₂, E₂₁, and E₃₀ indicate that E₂₂ likely contains two interstitials. The formation behavior of E₂₂ after irradiation in liquid nitrogen indicates that E₃₀ is required for formation of E₂₂. Eight defect states previously unseen after gamma irradiation were observed and characterized after irradiation by alpha and neutron sources. Their absence after gamma irradiation indicates that defect formation requires collision cascades. We demonstrate electrically pumped lasing from Ge epitaxially grown on Si. Lasing is observed over a ~ 200 nm bandwidth showing that this system holds promise for low-cost on-chip communications applications via silicon microphotonics. The observed large threshold currents are determined to be largely a result of recombination due to threading dislocations. We estimate that recombination by threading dislocations becomes negligible when threading dislocation density is </~ 4 10 ⁶ cm-². We developed a process for incorporation of colloidal quantum dots (QD) into a chalcogenide glass (ChG) matrix via solution based processing in common solvents. Observation of photoluminescence (PL) comparable to QD/polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) films shows potential for this material to form the basis for low cost light sources which can be integrated with ChG microphotonic systems. We investigated the impact of surface recombination on the benefit of combining a singlet <b>fission</b> <b>material</b> (tetracene) with a Si solar cell. Our simulations show that for efficiency gains, surface recombination velocity (SRV) for the tetracene/silicon interface must be less than 10 ⁴ cm s-¹. Characterization via radio frequency photoconductivity decay (RFPCD) measurements show that tetracene does not provide a sufficient level of passivation thus requiring another material which passivates the interface. Using thin films fabricated by atomic layer deposition (ALD), we showed the first direct evidence of triplet energy transfer to Si via magnetic field effect (MFE) PL measurements. by Neil Sunil Patel.

To resolve controversies about the mechanism of singlet fission, we have developed a first principles nonadiabatic quantum dynamical model that reveals the critical role of molecular stacking symmetry and provides a unified picture of coherent versus thermally activated singlet fission mechanisms in different acenes. The slip-stacked equilibrium packing structure of pentacene derivatives is found to enhance ultrafast singlet fission mediated by a coherent superexchange mechanism via higher-lying charge transfer states. By contrast, the electronic couplings for singlet fission strictly vanish at the C- 2 h symmetric equilibrium pi stacking of rubrene. In this case, singlet fission is driven by excitations of symmetry-breaking intermolecular vibrations, rationalizing the experimentally observed temperature dependence. Design rules for optimal singlet <b>fission</b> <b>materials</b> therefore need {{to account for the}} interplay of molecular pi-stacking symmetry and phonon-induced coherent or thermally activated mechanisms...|$|R
5000|$|In a bomb, a dense {{shell of}} {{material}} surrounding the fissile core will contain, via inertia, the expanding <b>fissioning</b> <b>material.</b> This increases the efficiency. A tamper {{also tends to}} act as a neutron reflector. Because a bomb relies on fast neutrons (not ones moderated by reflection with light elements, as in a reactor), because the neutrons reflected by a tamper are slowed by their collisions with the tamper nuclei, and because it takes time for the reflected neutrons to return to the fissile core, they take rather longer to be absorbed by a fissile nucleus. But they do contribute to the reaction, and can decrease the critical mass by a factor of four. [...] Also, if the tamper is (e.g. depleted) uranium, it can fission due to the high energy neutrons generated by the primary explosion. This can greatly increase yield, especially if even more neutrons are generated by fusing hydrogen isotopes, in a so-called boosted configuration.|$|R
