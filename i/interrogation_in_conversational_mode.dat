40|$|Abstract — Delay and jitter are {{important}} issues for real-time multimedia applications, particularly <b>in</b> <b>conversational</b> <b>mode.</b> Two causes of variable delay arise in IEEE 802. 11 ’s DCF RTS/CTS: packet arrival behavior at a transmitter’s buffer; and subsequent access contention for the wireless channel. This paper provides simulated results for both delay and jitter behavior for varying traffic sources. Bursty and non-bursty traffic conditions are modeled.

Groups interact with CONCORD <b>in</b> <b>conversational</b> <b>mode</b> over a remote terminal, and can bring it {{a wide variety of}} problems requiring coordination. The paper outlines the development of CONCORD and describes an experimental study comparing groups using CONCORD with those not using it in solving two problems.

Each station which is equipped with an analog-to-digital converter, a display and a keyboard-printer can perform the basic operations associated with a commercial hard-wired system. The stations are independent of one another but two or more accumulating or displaying simultaneously result in a slight increase in analog-to-digital converter dead time. The keyboard-printer operates <b>in</b> <b>conversational</b> <b>mode</b> with no output forthcoming if incorrect characters are entered. System procedures are initiated from the station keyboard to control the display, accumulate, integrate, and read and write functions as flexibly as possible without excessively increasing the program-to-data ratio for core usage. This system was designed to enable software to be modified when different procedures become necessary, and to enable adaptation of the available equipment to other modes of accumulation and display...|$|R

40|$|The File Design Analyzer is a {{software}} package which evaluates well-known data base storage structures and access methods {{in terms of}} secondary storage processing time and storage overhead required to service a set of user applications.

The paper describes three extensions which converted an abstract conceptual model into a practical tool for evaluation of existing or proposed data base designs: batched transactions, multi-access interference due to shared secondary storage, and analysis of variable record size.

40|$|In {{studying}} {{young children}} learning in inclusive environments, we designed ways to enable children to explore scientific {{knowledge that is}} usually believed to require later didactic teaching. Aspects of this design under scrutiny here are, first, the capacity of natural learning to lead to effective scientific ideas, and second, further clarification of the rcle of context. We found that <b>in</b> <b>conversational</b> <b>modes,</b> children were able to generate ideas and theories, to test them (by extended discussion in which they examined the logical consequences of holding those ideas, and by subjecting them to critical tests), and then to generate further theories. In doing so, the role of analogical analysis was especially productive; the simile of moving objects bouncing from a surface helped the idea of light traveling to emerge naturally (a contrary finding {{to the belief that}} understanding the propagation of light should precede the study of reflection). In this environment children studied keenly and cooperatively, kept records and critiqued the topic. As a result of this learning our view on the ages at which children might begin to deal with scientific ideas have been revised downwards.

Further, this {{should be in a}} form suitable for the implementation of automatic patching in a hybrid computer which contains the necessary switching matrix and hardware. The method of solution chosen here relies heavily on modern control theory, and in this lies both its strength and its weakness. The advantage of the method is that it forms a direct link between the State Space representation of a system and the analog computer simulation of that system. The chief disadvantage is that it is cumbersome in the handling of non-linear systems. The method can be divided broadly into two sections: 1) Digital simulation of system {{in order to determine the}} maximum values of all variables. 2) Scaling and analog set-up...|$|R

40|$|The MCS/SEL/BAS program {{provides}} {{a method for}} group recognition, based on a criterion of homogeneity within the groups. The basic aim of this clustering method is not to 'force' data {{into a number of}} separate groups, as it allows the possibility that a given element in the data set can be assigned to more than one group. Moreover, a parsimonious path through the groups is sought by selecting groups on the basis of two suitably chosen, peak-ordered criteria. This selection continues until a covering of the data set is obtained (i. e., until each element in the data set is assigned to at least one group). Then relationships occurring among the set of selected groups are investigated by means of two coefficients, called overlapping and cohesion coefficient, respectively. The utility of this program has been demonstrated here in elaborating large sets of data derived from mating type interactions of ciliates, but it can be used also for analyzing data derived from a wide spectrum of compatibility phenomena exhibited by other living organisms. Algorithms of this program are written in BASIC and formulated <b>in</b> a <b>conversational</b> <b>mode</b> for processing on a Macintosh. A computer program (MCS/SEL/BAS) is available from G.

While the inaugural program was broadcast to approximately 90 stations across the nation, reaching only a few hundred thousand listeners, “All Things Considered” has since become, according to NPR, “the most listened-to afternoon drive-time news radio program in the country.” ...|$|R

The thesis is comprised {{of a range of}} activity that represents a moment and way of writing practice. Three artworks that comprise part of the practical component of this thesis [...] - way from home, Take me to a place and Yodel Rodeo [...] each involved participation and contribution from particular audiences and social groups <b>in</b> spatial and <b>conversational</b> <b>modes</b> of performance executed through processes of wayfinding, mapping and walking. One of the primary contributions of knowledge of this research is the notion of homing tales and the knowledge derived from its deployment as a re-working of nostalgia and as a radical spatial narrative practice of home-making and orientation in specific contexts of migration. Another central contribution is the identification of a particular form of conversational ambulant practice within contemporary performance as conversive wayfinding, an artistic spatial practice where the performance event occurs <b>in</b> the <b>conversational</b> activity set <b>in</b> motion by the conditions of wayfinding. Among the questions raised are: How do contextually-based and participant-led performance mechanisms enable opportunities for participants to express strategies of home-making and enable participants to articulate their own critical perspectives and experiences of place, particularly in the experience of migration? How do people construct narratives and practices of home and identity in the experience of cultural and historical displacement?
