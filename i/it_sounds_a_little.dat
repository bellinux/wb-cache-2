Commenting on his writing for trio and quartet, Taborn stated that [...] "I like multiple kinds of rhythmic things.

500|$|While {{writing the}} book, Gladwell noted that [...] "the biggest {{misconception}} about success {{is that we}} do it solely on our smarts, ambition, hustle and hard work." [...] In Outliers, he hopes to show {{that there are a lot}} more variables involved in an individual's success than society cares to admit, and he wants people to [...] "move away from the notion that everything that happens to a person is up to that person". Gladwell noted that, although there was little that could be done with regard to a person's fate, society can still impact the [...] "man"-affected part of an individual's success. When asked what message he wanted people to take away after reading Outliers, Gladwell responded, [...] "What we do as a community, as a society, for each other, matters as much as what we do for ourselves. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> trite, but there's a powerful amount of truth in that, I think." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Bitch I'm Madonna" [...] has {{similarities}} to DJ Snake and Lil Jon's [...] "Turn Down for What" [...] (2013) with Madonna's vocals reminiscent of singer Miley Cyrus' autotuned rapping. The song has a tearing sound alongside the [...] "bleepy electro" [...] and [...] "churning" [...] dubstep composition. It {{begins with the}} sound of acoustic guitar reminiscent of Avicii's single [...] "Wake Me Up" [...] (2012), as Madonna coos in the background, [...] "You're gonna love this", but quickly transitions into what critic Sasha Geffen calls [...] "past stadium-filling EDM" [...] and into [...] "a genre that more commonly fills the headphones of kids surfing obscure music blogs late at night. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like vaporwave". The track deviates from a traditional song structure and hook, instead featuring harsh cuts, synths and Madonna singing in a nasal tone. Minaj raps in the track, asking everybody to [...] "go hard or go home", while Madonna shouts lyrics like, [...] "I just wanna have fun tonight, I wanna blow up this house tonight", [...] "alternating between pitch-shifted shrieks of 'Who do you think you are??' and the sing-songy title taunt." [...] Regarding her profuse usage of the word [...] "bitch" [...] in the song (along with another song [...] "Unapologetic Bitch" [...] from Rebel Heart), Madonna defended her decision to Billboard, saying: ...|$|E

6000|$|... 'Hum!' murmured the curate; {{there was}} really nothing {{questionable}} in that, {{but he was just}} slightly prejudiced against a man who made such <b>a</b> quotation; <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> priggish.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah! he {{said those}} tears settled the matter, {{and showed him}} {{that she had the}} woman's heart as well as the candour that would conquer her waywardness. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too like a lover's self-justification.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My name is Cameron--Walter Cameron--a {{well-known}} name {{among the}} Scottish hills, although <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> strange here.

60|$|We are camped near Temnin-el-Foka--a name {{which the}} boys have {{simplified}} a good deal, {{for the sake of}} convenience in spelling.

5000|$|Christensen {{was officially}} {{asked to write}} the people's gift to the wedding of Crown Prince Frederik and Mary Elizabeth Donaldson on 14 May 2004, but he turned it down: [...] "It was flattering, but I thought <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too corny. The task was much better placed {{in the hands of}} Erann DD." [...] Crown Prince Frederik has {{attended}} many shows by Dizzy Mizz Lizzy, and Crown Princess Mary is known to love Christensen's solo work.|$|R
60|$|Again {{the lion}} roared. <b>It</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> nearer. Tarzan felt the old, wild impulse to reply with the {{challenge}} of his kind. His kind? He had almost forgotten that he was a man and not an ape. He tugged at his bonds. God, if he could but get them near those strong teeth of his. He felt a wild wave of madness sweep over him as his efforts to regain his liberty met with failure.|$|R
60|$|Our Tobacco Parliament {{next set}} itself to {{consider}} by what means, if this happened, Canada could keep her identity unsubmerged; {{and that led}} {{to one of the}} most curious talks I have ever heard. It seemed to be decided that she might--just might--pull through by the skin of her teeth as a nation--if (but this was doubtful) England did not help others to hammer her. Now, twenty years ago one would not have heard any of this sort of thing. If <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> mad, remember that the Mother Country was throughout considered as a lady in violent hysterics.|$|E
60|$|Isa has acquiesced with an {{overflow}} {{of gratitude}} and affection {{to them for}} taking pity on her. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fulsome, but I believe {{some of it is}} genuine. She is really glad that some one wishes for her, and I can quite believe that she will lose in Avice all that made life congenial to her under Mary's brisk uncompromising rule. If she can only learn to be true--true to herself and to others--she will yet be a woman to love and esteem, and at Birchwood they will do their best to show that religious sentiment must be connected with Truth.|$|E
6000|$|And now, looking back, it {{cannot be}} said that Knox's {{intercourse}} with women was quite of the highest sort. It is characteristic that we find him more alarmed for his own reputation than for {{the reputation of the}} women with whom he was familiar. There was a fatal preponderance of self in all his intimacies: many women came to learn from him, but he never condescended to become a learner in his turn. And so there is not anything idyllic in these intimacies of his; and they were never so renovating to his spirit as they might have been. But I believe they were good enough for the women. I fancy the women knew what they were about when so many of them followed after Knox. It is not simply because a man is always fully persuaded that he knows the right from the wrong and sees his way plainly through the maze of life, great qualities as these are, that people will love and follow him, and write him letters full of their [...] "earnest desire for him" [...] when he is absent. It is not over a man, whose one characteristic is grim fixity of purpose, that the hearts of women are [...] "incensed and kindled with a special care," [...] as it were over their natural children. In the strong quiet patience of all his letters to the weariful Mrs. Bowes, we may perhaps see one cause of the fascination he possessed for these religious women. Here was one whom you could besiege all the year round with inconsistent scruples and complaints; you might write to him on Thursday that you were so elated it was plain the devil was deceiving you, and again on Friday that you were so depressed it was plain God had cast you off for ever; and he would read all this patiently and sympathetically, and give you an answer in the most reassuring polysyllables, and all divided into heads - who knows? - like a treatise on divinity. And then, those easy tears of his. There are some women who like to see men crying; and here was this great-voiced, bearded man of God, who might be seen beating the solid pulpit every Sunday, and casting abroad his clamorous denunciations to the terror of all, and who on the Monday would sit in their parlours by the hour, and weep with them over their manifold trials and temptations. Nowadays, he would have to drink a dish of tea with all these penitents. [...] . <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> vulgar, as the past will do, if we look into it too closely. We could not let these great folk of old into our drawing-rooms. Queen Elizabeth would positively not be eligible for a housemaid.

So that this little note of vulgarity is not a thing to be dwelt upon; it is to be put away from us, as we recall the fashion of these old intimacies; so that we may only remember Knox as one who was very long-suffering with women, kind to them in his own way, loving them in his own way - and that not the worst way, if it was not the best - and once at least, if not twice, moved to his heart of hearts by a woman, and giving expression to the yearning he had for her society in words that none of us need be ashamed to borrow.|$|E

5000|$|At Renowned for Sound, Jana Angeles {{regarded}} it as a [...] "solid track", saying [...] "...it's fantastic {{to see how}} {{the band}} have emerged from being a pop punk band into a band that isn't afraid to challenge themselves by experimenting in other musical genres." [...] Ed Masley at The Arizona Republic ranked it as the 5th best Paramore song, commenting [...] "Does <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like <b>a</b> female-fronted Goo Goo Dolls in [...] "Iris" [...] mode?

5000|$|In the June 1995 {{issue of}} Wired, Jennifer Cobb Kreisberg said, [...] "Teilhard saw the Net coming {{more than half}} a century before it arrived":Teilhard {{imagined}} a stage of evolution characterized by a complex membrane of information enveloping the globe and fueled by human consciousness. <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> off-the-wall, until you think about the Net, that vast electronic web encircling the Earth, running point to point through a nerve-like constellation of wires.|$|E
5000|$|He also leased {{the tracks}} to a USA based label called Anahuac. They remixed {{the tracks and}} used some {{alternate}} takes (tracks 6, 7, 9 and 10). Bing Crosby himself felt that this improved the album and {{he wrote to his}} friend Leslie Gaylor in a letter dated July 11, 1977."The Bingo Viejo record has been remixed and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> much better than ever it did before. I don’t know what they did to it but they brought up the vocal <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more and cut down on the background, which made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more intimate and <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more personal." ...|$|R
50|$|This track has dual rhythm guitars {{serving as}} percussion, {{but there is}} quite a bit of {{additional}} recording compared to other songs on the album. The soft and high voices, the trebly sound of the guitars and piano, and Bill Shepherd's arrangement with harps and violins made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more precious than usual, and as the opening track it set a tone for Idea that was quite a bit more lightweight than Horizontal. On The Studio Albums 1967 - 1968 has a mono mix of an earlier state of the recording, with different lead vocal sung entirely by Barry and some instrumental differences and faded at 3:34.|$|R
60|$|After Nevers he {{was only}} twenty-four hours ahead of Napoleon and his {{progress}} became a triumphant one: newspapers, despatches had filtrated through from Paris--news became authentic, though some of <b>it</b> <b>sounded</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> wild. Wherever de Marmont arrived he was received with acclamations {{as the man who}} had seen the Emperor, who had assisted at the Emperor's magnificent entry into Grenoble, who could assure citizens and peasantry that it was all true, that the Emperor would be in Paris again very shortly and that once more there would be an end to tyranny and oppression, to the rule of the aristocrats and a number of incompetent and fatuous princes.|$|R
50|$|It's had effects {{around the}} margins, of course, {{but they have}} mostly been minor. When I wrote it, I really thought the book would change the world.

It looked as if real changes were possible, and I let myself believe that this would be one of them. All {{you have to do is}} walk around the corner to McDonald's to see how {{successful}} I have been.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{song for}} Andriano's wife, {{he wrote it}} as [...] " [...] a simple [...] "I miss you" [...] song, with a hint of, [...] "I know I'm gone a lot, but please don't leave me." [...] <b>It</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like well-worn {{territory}} for some, I suppose. But I've never felt like this in my life, and I'm 34 years old and {{have been married for}} 9 years".

"The bad guy has {{collected}} {{a whole bunch}} of car batteries in his hotel room and they buzz and zap and really get going when he throws the switch to zap the host and hold the smoke monster inside him.

This episode had lots of little electrical things scattered around and I tried to make <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like the Exploratorium in San Francisco, California, with all of its electricity-based exhibits."

6000|$|His assent was instant. [...] "You {{think it}} not quite like me? You are right. <b>It</b> does <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> lurid. I may never write it, but if I do, {{you may be}} sure it will be treated {{in my own way}} and not in Hawthorne's way." ...|$|R

5000|$|AllMusic {{highlighted}} {{the song and}} added: [...] "This record bubbles over with imagination, as hooky pop songs like the title track rub shoulders with glitzy dancefloor anthems like [...] "Get the Party Started." [...] Jim Farber was favorable: [...] "The single [...] "Get the Party Started" [...] has the tricky synth hook of a perfect new-wave hit from the '80s." [...] NME was less positive: [...] "displays the kind of clod-hopping attention-seeking on single 'Get the Party Started' that makes you assume you're listening to a Geri Halliwell record." [...] Jason Thompson described this song and praised: [...] "the dance inducing “Get the Party Started”. Again, even this isn’t really in the mold of current dance tracks. Instead, it feels more like the kinds of grooves that were {{coming out in the}} early Nineties, when alt-rock was influencing the discos as well as the college charts. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> like Apollo Smile who had an album out back in ‘91 or so. “Get the Party Started” also echoes the good time vibe that other hits like Deee-Lite’s “Groove Is in the Heart” had that won over many fans. This track should do just the same thing. It did for me, anyway." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tiffany {{also spoke}} {{of working on}} the album and the new vocal technique, {{revealing}} [...] "Of course, I come in with dark hair and lipstick and all these different things representing that album to my label, and they were horrified. They were scared to death. I was really thrilled that Donnie Wahlberg {{became a part of}} that project, and I worked with some great people. Phillip Damien was awesome. I think he vocally took me to a whole different level. A lot of my fans at first were like, [...] "Oh, I don't know if I like that tone of your voice, and you're hitting notes that I'm not used to, and <b>it</b> <b>sounds</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> screechy," [...] but as a vocalist, for me that was such an experience, because I tapped into things I didn't know I could do. Now, I've finessed them more, but {{just to be able to}} go, [...] "Let's push it a little bit," [...] unfortunately, you're always exposing yourself in front of the masses. Now, I think if we were to do that project, it’d be totally different. I definitely think that I'd probably even sound better on those songs, but I loved it. It was great. I was 18 in New York City recording an album; I thought I was really cool!" ...|$|E

5000|$|About Roots to Branches, Ian Anderson said: [...] "I see Roots To Branches as the 90s {{version of}} Stand Up, {{because it has}} a lot of the things that I feel {{represented}} the key elements of Jethro Tull: there's lots of flute, lots of riffy guitars and quite a broad palette of influences, from the blues and classical to the Eastern motifs that were apparent on Stand Up [...] ". On the other hand, Anderson also added that [...] "the only thing about it that lets me down is that I made <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> too Seventies. I deliberately made the album <b>sound</b> like <b>it</b> was in the context of a live performance, rather than have <b>it</b> <b>sound</b> too 'studio.' But looking back on it, I think it should have been a bit more varied".|$|R
5000|$|The MTV News {{stated that}} with the 2012 EP, [...] "nobody likes change, {{and it seems like}} they’ve stuck to a formula that they know works.
