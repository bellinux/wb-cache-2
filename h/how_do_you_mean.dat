6000|$|... 'Yes, {{what about}} him?' said Mike. 'You'll {{have a pretty}} tough job turning him into a {{friendly}} native, I should think. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to start?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Ciccu! Ciccu!' whispered his brothers, {{horrified at}} this extravagance, 'are <b>you</b> mad? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> ever <b>mean</b> {{to pay for}} it?' ...|$|R
6000|$|RIDGEON [gabbling and stuttering] What husband? Whose husband? Which husband? Whom? <b>how?</b> what? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to {{say that}} you have married again? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Passages!" [...] {{repeated}} Sir Philip thoughtfully. [...] "Mistress Anne, <b>how</b> much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> by that? Surely {{there is}} no promise between you?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Arabella," [...] {{said the}} mother, [...] "it {{is clear that}} you do not look into the future. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to live? You are getting old." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Suitings? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> suitings? I haven't any suitings! Who do {{you think}} I am? Vincent Astor? All I have is what I stand up in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'She could insure her life. D---- me, sir, {{we must do}} something. If {{you turn}} up your nose at one woman after another <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to live?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Pray, madam, <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to stay here? I {{see nothing}} to eat, and {{though you may}} be very charming, the sight of <b>you</b> <b>does</b> not prevent me from famishing.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bielby {{is quite}} right; {{he is the}} most judicious of college dons and father-confessors, old man. And <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to remain his pupil and penitent? And how is the pothouse getting on?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{very sorry}} that I am engaged this evening, Hampton, or else {{we might have}} dined together. It is one I cannot very well get out of. <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to be away?' ...|$|R
6000|$|The new passenger, {{without any}} {{expression}} of anxiety, {{looks into the}} coach, and then {{looks up at the}} coachman: 'Now, <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to fix it?' says he, after a pause: 'for I MUST go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Forgive me, captain; if you {{had seen}} your own face, you would have joined in the laugh. I will be more careful. But <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to proceed, {{and what do you}} wish me to do?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But I say, leftenant, <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to keep pullin' about here, {{without an}} enemy, or, {{as far as}} I can see, an object in view? Don't you think we might land, and let Minnie {{see some of the}} caves?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{must have}} had a trying march if you {{followed}} our trail," [...] she said. [...] "But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> get here--I <b>mean</b> why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> leave Switzerland?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{should like}} {{it pretty much}} such a room as this kitchen," [...] {{answered}} Tabitha. [...] "It will never be like home to me till the chimney-corner gets as black with smoke as this, and that won't be these hundred years. <b>How</b> much <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to lay out on the house, Mr. Peter?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Watching by me! <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean?</b> Why {{watching}} by me?" [...] His eye had now lit on his heavily bandaged wrist. He {{went on in}} {{a different}} tone; less aggressive, more genial, as of one accepting facts: ...|$|E
6000|$|Marston smoked for a time, glancing sympathetically at Wyndham, who knitted his brows. Then Bob said, [...] "To begin with, we {{have got}} to bluff Larrinaga and he is not a fool. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to satisfy him?" ...|$|E

60|$|Q. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean?--A. I <b>mean</b> if {{they have}} seen {{themselves}} delivered from this state, by being by the Word and Spirit of God implanted into the faith of Christ (Rom 11:17-19).|$|R
6000|$|How long {{we slept}} I cannot tell; but this I know--that when we {{lay down the}} sun was setting, and when we awoke it was high in the heavens. I awoke Jack, who started up in surprise, being unable at first to {{comprehend}} our situation. [...] "Now, then," [...] said he, springing up, [...] "let's see after breakfast.--Hallo, Peterkin, lazy fellow! <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to lie there?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} he did. He was your servant, and {{was obliged to}} explain. I am your husband, and am NOT obliged. <b>How</b> much longer <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to keep me here? I tell you again, {{there is no time}} for reading anything--the dog-cart is waiting at the door. Once for all, will you sign or will you not?" ...|$|R
60|$|Silas {{looks as}} hard at his one leg {{as he can}} in the dim light, and after a pause sulkily opines 'that {{it must be the}} fault of the other people. Or <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to say it comes about?' he demands impatiently.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm glad of that; and <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> {{to spend}} these {{long years of}} yours?" [...] asked David, {{brushing}} back the lock of hair that was always falling into his eyes, {{as if he wanted}} to see more clearly the hopeful face before him.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll do it again!' cried Mr Pecksniff, as {{he resumed}} {{his seat and}} fetched his breath, 'if you dare to talk in that loud manner. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> about being shamefully used? If Mr Jonas chose your sister in {{preference}} to you, who could help it, I should wish to know? What have I to do with it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, his {{self-restraint}} failing him, {{he slipped}} an arm {{about her and}} held her tightly to him.

6000|$|... "I don't doubt it. Upon my word I don't. I {{think you}} were capable of it. It was stupid in me {{to let you go}} over there and make such an {{exhibition}} of yourself. But you know I couldn't really believe <b>you</b> would <b>do</b> such an inexcusable thing. What will those people think of us? But <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> say it?--I <b>mean</b> the manner of it. I hope you were not abrupt." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'What now?' said Catherine, leaning back, and {{returning}} his look with a suddenly clouded brow: her humour {{was a mere}} vane for constantly varying caprices. 'You and Edgar have broken my heart, Heathcliff! And you both come to bewail the deed to me, {{as if you were}} the people to be pitied! I shall not pity you, not I. You have killed me--and thriven on it, I think. How strong you are! <b>How</b> many years <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to live after I am gone?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Well, I don’t know it, and I don’t {{know that}} I {{want to know}} it. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean,</b> aristocratic? What {{profession}} is? It would be rather a curious one. Professions are meant {{to do the work}} of professions; and what work’s done without your sleeves rolled up? Many of the gentlemen at the congress there are quite charming.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well-nigh half of {{them are}} still alive," [...] he said, [...] "and all of them are men of rank and repute, whose word would be taken even by an enemy. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to proceed? Because I am afraid that, even if we could spare them, there would be some {{difficulty}} about their making their appearance in a court, in either England or Ireland." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Beautiful morning, Moore. How do, my boy? Ha! {{whom have}} we here?" [...] (turning to the personage with the staff). [...] "Sugden! What! you're {{going to work}} directly? On my word, you lose no time. But I come to ask explanations. Your message was {{delivered}} to me. Are you sure {{you are on the}} right scent? <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to set about the business? Have you got a warrant?" ...|$|E
5000|$|Plato {{spoke of}} {{mathematics}} by: <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> mean?I <b>mean,</b> as I was saying, that arithmetic {{has a very}} great and elevating effect, compelling the soul to reason about abstract number, and rebelling against the introduction of visible or tangible objects into the argument. You know how steadily the masters of the art repel and ridicule any one who attempts to divide absolute unity when he is calculating, and if you divide, they multiply, taking care that one shall continue one and not become lost in fractions.That is very true.Now, suppose a person were to say to them: O my friends, what are these wonderful numbers about which you are reasoning, in which, as you say, there is a unity such as you demand, and each unit is equal, invariable, indivisible, --what would they answer? Plato ...|$|R
6000|$|Herbert {{took up his}} hat doubtfully. 'Selah!--Selah!--Miss Briggs, I mean,' he said, falteringly, for at {{that moment}} Selah's face was terrible to look at. 'I'm very sorry, I can assure you, that this interview--and our {{pleasant}} acquaintance--should unfortunately have had such a disagreeable termination. For my own part'--Herbert was always politic--'I should have wished to part with you in no unfriendly spirit. I should have wished to learn your plans for the future, and to aid you in forming a suitable settlement in life hereafter. May I venture to ask, before I go, whether <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to remain in London or to return to Hastings? As {{one who has been}} your sincere friend, I should at least like to know what are your movements for the immediate present. <b>How</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>mean</b> to stop here, and when you leave these rooms where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think you will next go to?'--'Confoundedly awkward,' he thought to himself, 'to have her prowling about and dogging one's footsteps here in London.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Henry Crawford {{had quite}} {{made up his}} mind by the next morning to give another {{fortnight}} to Mansfield, and having sent for his hunters, and written a few lines of explanation to the Admiral, he looked round at his sister as he sealed and threw the letter from him, and seeing the coast clear {{of the rest of the}} family, said, with a smile, [...] "And <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think I <b>mean</b> to amuse myself, Mary, on the days that I do not hunt? I am grown too old to go out more than three times a week; but I have a plan for the intermediate days, and what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think it is?" ...|$|R
