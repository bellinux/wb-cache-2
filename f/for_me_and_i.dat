I genuinely want to tour with these new songs, as well as older hits.

Ellis-Bextor later talked on the chart success the song had, [...] "It just didn't get heard by enough people, [...] I suppose as well it felt {{slightly}} frustrating {{because it was a}} slightly different style of song <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> really got sort of punished for it." ...|$|E

500|$|Avnet and Conran {{spent two}} years working on the screenplay, which {{included}} numerous genre-related references and homages, and developing a working relationship. Then, the producer took the script and the trailer and began approaching actors. In order to protect Conran's vision, Avnet decided to shoot the movie independently {{with a lot of}} his own money. The producer realized that [...] "the very thing that made this film potentially so exciting <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> think for an audience, which was the personal nature of it and the singularity of the vision, would never succeed and never survive the development process within a studio." ...|$|E
500|$|According to {{spokesperson}} Liz Rosenberg, Madonna considered titling {{the album}} Mantra, which {{she thought was}} a [...] "really cool title". However, she changed the title to Ray of Light, as her albums were always titled {{after one of the}} songs from that album. The artwork was shot by Peruvian photographer Mario Testino on November 28, 1997 in a studio in Golden Beach, Florida. They had previously collaborated for a Versace brand collection in 1995. Madonna was impressed with the natural look Testino had captured, so she booked him again for the album's photoshoot. He recalled, [...] "At 2pm she said, 'OK, I'm tired. We're done'. And I said, 'But I don't have the pictures yet'. She said, 'You're working <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say we're done'. I said, 'No, we carry on'. The picture she used on the cover came after that".|$|E

The company, which owns Kmart and ShopYourWay, a shopping social platform, also included rapper Nicki Minaj in the same contract. The menswear collection was launched on October 1 that year and conducts business via 500 Kmart stores across the US, as well as online. In an official statement, Levine said: [...] "Partnering with ShopYourWay to develop this line was an exciting opportunity <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> am really looking forward to diving into the process of designing an apparel and accessory collection". In an interview with People, he commented further, [...] "it was cool that they really promoted creative control. I like to be involved with process rather than just phoning it in".|$|E

I let 50 years go by and see what's really relevant." [...] Welch has acknowledged inspiration from several traditional country artists, including the Stanley Brothers, the Carter Family, the Louvin Brothers, and the Blue Sky Boys. She explained her relationship with traditional music by saying, [...] "I've never tried to be traditional. It's been a springboard <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> love it and revere it and would not be doing what I do without the music of the Monroe Brothers, the Stanley Brothers and the Carter Family. However, it was clear I {{was never going to be}} able to do exactly that; I'm a songwriter." ...|$|E
500|$|Madonna worked {{primarily}} with Orbit after Guy Oseary, Maverick Records's partner, phoned Orbit {{and suggested that}} he send some songs to the singer. He sent a 13-track digital audio tape (DAT) to Madonna, and [...] "Frozen" [...] was among these tracks. [...] "I was {{a huge fan of}} William's earlier records. [...] I also loved all the remixes he did <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time", Madonna said. The singer drew inspiration from Bernardo Bertolucci's 1990 British-Italian drama film, The Sheltering Sky, which dealt with a couple trying to save their marriage during a trip to Africa. She wanted to have the [...] "whole Moroccan/orchestral/super-romantic/man-carrying-the-woman-he-loves-across-the-desert vibe" [...] for the track. Still continuing work with Leonard on some of the tracks, Madonna asked him to give her a composition with [...] "tribal feel, something really lush and romantic". They composed the melody on the DAT and recorded the demo, which stretched to over 10 minutes due to Madonna continuing writing the track.|$|E
500|$|In a 3 September 2013 {{interview}} with Rolling Stone, Mick Jones discussed the band reuniting saying it {{likely would have}} never happened. Jones said [...] "There were a few moments at the time I was up for it (Hall of Fame reunion in 2003), Joe was up for it. Paul wasn't. And neither, probably, was Topper, who didn't wind up even coming in the end. It didn't look like a performance {{was going to happen}} anyway. I mean, you usually play at that ceremony when you get in. Joe had passed by that point, so we didn't. We were never in agreement. It was never at a point where all of us wanted to do it at the same time. Most importantly for us, we became friends again after the group broke up, and continued that way {{for the rest of the}} time. That was more important to us than the band". Jones also stated that the Sound System box set was the last time he will ever be involved in the band's releases. [...] "I'm not even thinking about any more Clash releases. This is it <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> say that with an exclamation mark." [...] Jones said.|$|E

500|$|After {{abandoning the}} songs {{she had written}} with Babyface, Madonna turned to {{musician}} Rick Nowels, who had previously co-written songs with Stevie Nicks and Celine Dion. The collaboration produced seven songs in nine days, but those songs also did not display the album's future electronic musical direction. Three of the songs, [...] "The Power of Good-Bye", [...] "To Have and Not to Hold" [...] and [...] "Little Star", appear on the album. Madonna then began writing songs with Leonard, who had produced many songs for Madonna in the late 1980s. Unlike her previous albums, Leonard's song writing collaborations were accompanied by very little studio input. Madonna believed that Leonard's production [...] "would have lent the songs more of a Peter Gabriel vibe", a sound {{that she did not}} want for the album. Guy Oseary, chairman of Maverick Records, then phoned British electronic musician William Orbit, and suggested that he send some songs to Madonna. Orbit sent a 13-track digital audio tape to Madonna. [...] "I was a huge fan of William's earlier records, Strange Cargo 1 and 2 and all that. I also loved all the remixes he did <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was interested in fusing a kind of futuristic sound but also using lots of Indian and Moroccan influences and things like that, and I wanted it to sound old and new at the same time," [...] Madonna said.|$|E

During the promotional campaign {{leading up to the}} release of Reclassified, Azalea revealed that she would be collaborating with Ellie Goulding on a track titled [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] featured in the film [...] In October 2014, while giving an interview with Radio.com, Azalea mentioned her longtime desire to work with Goulding, and after meeting her several times, was approached about a song that would eventually become [...] "Heavy Crown". She recalled one meeting, [...] "she played it <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> was in love with it and just felt it was so kind of appropriate for this to be our collaboration", because it [...] "brings out something different in both artists that you don't usually see." [...] On 14 November, a preview of [...] "Heavy Crown" [...] was uploaded to Azalea's VEVO channel. In December 2014, [...] "Trouble" [...] was announced to be the next single from Reclassified, as opposed to [...] "Heavy Crown". Fans reacted badly, leading to Azalea releasing a statement explaining that test audiences had preferred [...] "Trouble" [...] over [...] "Heavy Crown", and that the duet with Goulding was not [...] "formatted for pop or rhythmic radio".|$|E
500|$|Robinson {{received}} his degree in 1973 and was ordained a deacon in June 1973 at the cathedral {{of the diocese}} of Newark, New Jersey. [...] He served as curate at Christ Church in Ridgewood, New Jersey, and was ordained a priest six months later. He and his wife remained at the Ridgewood parish for two years until June 1975. They then moved to New Hampshire, where Boo had grown up. Their goal was {{to start a business}} and ministry: in the winter it was called [...] "The Sign of the Dove Retreat Center" [...] and in the summer it became [...] "Pony Farm". [...] Boo still runs [...] "Pony Farm" [...] as a horse camp for children. In 1977, Robinson began working with a committee in the Diocese of New Hampshire to study human sexuality and co-authored a small manual on the subject. Robinson and Boo's first daughter, Jamee, was born in 1977, followed by a second daughter, Ella, in 1981. Robinson treasures his marriage stating, [...] "hat is inextricably tied up with having children. And since I cannot imagine my life without Jamee and Ella, it's just a completely irrelevant question <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>And</b> <b>I</b> don't regret having been married to Boo, either, even if there had not been children. It's just a part of my journey, and why would I possibly regret that?" ...|$|E

500|$|Having been {{released}} by Stevenage {{at the end}} of the 2010–11 season, Odubade signed for Conference National side Gateshead on 7 June 2011. He joined Gateshead on a free transfer, signing for the club alongside Eddie Odhiambo; the two had previously played alongside each other at Oxford United, Stevenage, and Newport County. On joining Gateshead, Odubade said [...] "I have parted company with Stevenage on good terms and this is now a new chapter for me. Gateshead is a good club that is moving in the right direction and I'm sure we can kick on next season. I don't look back with any regrets as things happen for a reason. I am always looking forward. Gateshead is a new challenge <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>and</b> <b>I</b> can only see good things coming from it". He made his Gateshead debut on 13 August 2011 in the club's 3–2 away win against Kidderminster Harriers at Aggborough, assisting Kris Gate's goal in the 80th minute. Odubade scored his first goal for Gateshead three days later at Gateshead International Stadium in Gateshead's 3–0 win against Mansfield Town, which was voted Goal of the Season in the club's end of season awards. His first season at Gateshead was disrupted by two-foot injuries midway through the campaign, with Odubade breaking his metatarsal bone on two occasions, subsequently missing a total of 18 games. Despite the injuries, he made 34 appearances throughout the season, scoring seven times. He signed a one-year contract extension with Gateshead in May 2012.|$|E
