40|$|This {{literature}} review unveils possible behavioural causes {{of violence against}} women and presents behavioural levers to its prevention and reduction, along with general principles for effective communication. Several awareness-raising and education initiatives {{in the field and}} containing a behavioural component are pointed out. The proposed approach puts a strong focus on the evaluation of actual impact. Four main conclusions are reached: 1. Initiatives should be designed to encourage or discourage a specific behaviour in a well-defined target group; 2. Initiatives should be designed using appropriate behavioural levers; 3. In order to ensure that initiative has the intended effects on the target audience, pretesting is crucial; 4. It is essential to set specific, measurable, attainable, realistic and timely objectives, and to evaluate them.

40|$|The {{emergence}} of frequent personal data breaches of a cross-border and even pan-European dimension {{coupled with the}} current lack of harmonized and systematic approaches to tackle them have motivated {{the need for further}} research leading to possible improvement of those cooperation challenges. In this respect, we report here on the organization, execution and analysis of the 1 st Pan-European Personal Data Breaches Exercise that was conducted at the end of 2015 by the Directorate-General Joint Research Centre in collaboration with the Directorate-General for <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumers</b> of the European Commission and the Data Protection Authorities of seven EU Member States. This cyber-exercise aimed at promoting and improving collaboration between Member States when cross-border incidents of personal data breaches occur, by serving as training exercise, mapping existing procedures and by helping identify best practices to handle such incidents. This scientific initiative constitutes a direct support of the recently adopted General Data Protection Regulation. Analysis of results led to some very interesting findings. In particular, communication issues were the ones that were highlighted as the most important ones. There is an evident lack of a global communication list of competent officers from Data Protection Authorities and this hinders cooperation. Moreover, there are no established current practices on handling such incidents and accordingly their management is still performed in an ad hoc manner. The outcome of the exercise illustrated the need for putting in place systematic procedures, as well as tools and frameworks to support communication and interaction between all interested stakeholders.

The promotion and protection of the rights of the child is one of the objectives of the EU on which the Treaty of Lisbon has put further emphasis. This report is part of a study ‘to collect data on children’s involvement in judicial proceedings in the EU’ which supports the implementation of the Commission Communication of 15 February 2011 ‘An EU Agenda for the rights of the child’, which identified the lack of reliable, comparable and official data on the situation of children in the Member States (MS). This deficiency is a serious obstacle to the development and implementation of evidence-based policies and is particularly evident in the context of child friendly justice and the protection of children in vulnerable situations. Making the justice system more child friendly in Europe is a key action of the EU Agenda. It is an area of high practical relevance where the EU has, under the Treaties, competences to turn the rights of the child into reality by means of EU legislation. Improved data is crucial to the framing of such legislation. The objective of this study is: to establish statistics and collect data based on structural, process and outcome indicators on children involved in administrative judicial proceedings for the years 2008 - 2010 (and 2011 if available) for all 28 EU Member States; to provide a narrative overview of children’s involvement in administrative judicial proceedings in the EU. The report describes the situation in each Member State as at 1 June 2012. This report examines the safeguards in place for children involved in administrative judicial proceedings.

This work was made available {{with the help of the}} Publications Office of the European Union, Copyright and Legal Issues Section. Maltese law provides some special measures for children involved in criminal proceedings. However, these are rather limited and very often the position of the child victim, witness or suspect is similar to that of an adult involved in criminal proceedings. This means that children and adults have the same extent of rights to be heard and to participate in the criminal process but special mechanisms that take into account the vulnerability and best interests of children are scarce. For instance, there seem to be no special measures aimed at ensuring that child victims and suspects are provided with the necessary information during proceedings. This would seem to be a rather important element in ensuring child friendly justice. The position of the child victim and child witness is generally the same given that the criminal action is a public action prosecuted by the police or the Attorney General. In fact, the position of the victim is traditionally that of witness. Nevertheless, there are certain measures that allow for more active participation of victims when compared to other witnesses. These measures typically apply to both adults and children. With reference to child suspects, the most important child friendly measures are the existence of the Juvenile Court and the availability of care orders issued by the Minister for social welfare. The Juvenile Court provides a somewhat more child-friendly setting than the normal courts of criminal justice. Care orders, on the other hand, can constitute an alternative to imprisonment for children convicted of a criminal offence. However, these measures are only available for children under 16 years of age. Children between 16 and 18 years of age will be tried in the same court as adults. Moreover, children under 16 years charged jointly with a person over 16 years of age will also be tried in the same court as an adult and will not benefit from the special measures available in the Juvenile Court. It must be noted that the age threshold for criminal responsibility in Malta is very low (nine years of age). Children between 9 and 14 years of age are exempt from criminal responsibility for any act or omission done without mischievous discretion (that is, knowledge of the wrongfulness of the act and its consequences). However, if children in this age group act with a mischievous discretion they are liable to punishment. For children between 14 and 18 years of age, the applicable punishment is diminished by one or two degrees. The punishments that can be imposed on adults can also be imposed on children but certain reductions may be applied in favour of children depending on their age. Once the child reaches 18 years of age, there is full criminal responsibilityN/...|$|E
40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of a study of the requirements for developing a Digital Competence Framework {{in the context of a}} digital marketplace in the EU. Consumer digital competence is defined as the competence consumers need to function actively, safely and assertively in the digital marketplace. This framework will define the skills, knowledge and attitudes that consumers need to navigate the complex digital environment. The research project to create the Digital Competence Framework for Consumers is a joint action of DG <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumers</b> (JUST), and the Joint Research Centre (JRC), the Commission’s science and knowledge service. The work, carried out between 2015 - 2016, aimed to achieve the goals set out by the European Commission in its two recent Communications: “A New Skills Agenda For Europe - Working together to strengthen human capital, employability and competitiveness” (European Commission, 2016) and “A Digital Single Market Strategy for Europe” (European Commission, 2015). Both these Communications focus on the importance of citizens’ digital skills and their capacity to participate more deeply in our digital society and economy. The study presented in this report is designed to elicit user requirements in order to support the development of the Digital Competence Framework for Consumers. The study was commissioned by the Joint Research Centre and it is a result of collaborative work between the authors of the report. Further consultation on requirements was carried out with DG JUST in which experts on various topics gave their input and contributed to the text. The literature and the hot-button issues described in this report reflect the state-of-play in 2015, when the study was carried out. The methodology used to clarify the requirements for a consumer digital competence framework had four main steps. First, a ‘broad-but-shallow’ look into important emerging issues in the field of online shopping and advertisement was taken. In this phase of the study, a number of European Commission working documents on the issue were reviewed. The focus was also on current relevant literature, both academic and grey literature. Second, the existing terms and major work in consumer competence was reviewed and links were made to behavioural insights. It emerged that lack of digital competence can make consumers vulnerable in today’s complex digital environment. Third, part of the work consisted of testing the suitability of the existing Digital Competence Framework for Citizens (DigComp) in an expert workshop to further prompt requirements for the new framework. Lastly, to finalise the process of requirement gathering, a gap analysis was conducted on a number of prominent sources of educational material for consumer competence. The study found that the DigComp framework was a suitable starting point and confirms that it could be adapted to the new context of the digital marketplace. However, the analysis also showed that not all competencies are covered by the existing framework, in particular with regards to emerging digital trends and issues outlined. The final product of the project, the Digital Competence Framework for Consumers, is described in a JRC Science for Policy publication by Brecko & Ferrari (2016).

40|$|Quick guide Nowadays, tattoos are {{considered}} body art and are largely spread. They are applied by injecting coloured inks into the dermis and {{are meant to}} stay life long, thus resulting in long term exposure to the chemicals injected including their degradation products. Permanent Make-up (PMU) consists in (semi) permanent tattoos used to resemble make-up. Policy context This report addresses {{the issue of the}} safety of tattoo/PMU products and practices with a view to contribute to consumers' health protection. It has been prepared on behalf of the Directorate General <b>Justice</b> <b>and</b> <b>Consumers</b> (DG JUST), however it might also be of interest to other stakeholders dealing with health, internal market and environment, {{as well as to the}} European Chemicals Agency (ECHA). The conclusions of this project aim to provide the European Commission (EC) with the scientific evidences needed to decide if European Union (EU) measures are necessary to ensure the safety of tattoo/PMU inks and processes. In fact, apart from the general safety requirements by the General Product Safety Directive (GPSD) currently there is no specific EU legislation on tattoos/PMU products. In particular with regards to chemical requirements, there are chemicals which are banned in consumer products that get into direct contact with the skin under different EU legislations, like the Cosmetic Product Regulation or REACH, but not in tattoo inks. The report presents an updated review of the national legislative framework, ink ingredients in use and reported adverse health effects, as well as new data on analytical methods, statistics, market surveillance and RAPEX (Rapid alert system for non-food dangerous products) notifications, risk perception and communication and experience with the implementation of the Council of Europe (CoE) Resolutions (ResAP). Main findings Specific legislation, based on the CoE ResAPs (either of 2003 or 2008), exists in 7 Member States (MS) and 3 EFTA (European Free Trade Association) countries. 3 MS notified their draft legal acts (currently on-hold). Statistics show that 12 % of Europeans and up to 24 % of United States' citizens are estimated to be tattooed, including teenagers. Tattoo prevalence in young adults may represent more than the double and is sometimes higher in women than in men, in particular in young generations. Tattoo/PMU inks contain several ingredients, plus impurities. More than 100 colorants and 100 additives are in use. Most tattoo inks on the EU market are imported from the US, while PMU inks are generally manufactured in Europe. The pigments used are not specifically produced for tattoo/PMU applications and generally show low purity. The majority of them is not authorised for the use in cosmetic products and several should not be present according to the CoE ResAP(2008) 1. Over 80 % of the colorants in use are organic and more than 60 % of them are azo-pigments, some of which can release carcinogenic aromatic amines. This degradation may happen in the skin, particularly under solar/Ultra Violet radiation exposure or laser irradiation. Harmonised analytical methods for the analysis of tattoo/PMU inks are missing and need to be developed. For market surveillance purposes test methods developed for other products are used with some modifications. Tattoo/PMU products containing hazardous chemicals have been found on the European market. Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons (PAH) (43 %), Primary Aromatic Amines (PAA) (14 %), heavy metals (9 %) and preservatives (6 %), as well as microbiological contamination (11 %) were detected in the indicated percentages of the analysed samples. In the absence of systematic data gathering, the actual prevalence of tattoo complications (mainly of dermatological nature) is currently unknown. Most complaints are transient and inherent to the wound healing process, but in some cases, up to 5 % of the tattooed persons, bacterial infections may occur, especially in unhygienic settings. Acute allergy and delayed hypersensitivity prompted by i. e. the inks ingredients and tattoo/removal trauma represent the bulk of tattoo/PMU complications, affecting mostly the red or black parts of the tattoos. Such nonspecific reactions, frequently exacerbated by sun exposure, are unpredictable and may sometimes appear after a long latency (decades), giving rise to chronic sequels in connection with underlying auto-immune pathologies. Additional adverse health effects, like skin pigmentation disorders may be encountered in 5 - 15 % of patients having laser therapy, which is not always effective in removing completely the undesired tattoos. (Skin) cancer risk from tattoo procedures has been neither proved nor excluded. Based on the experience gained from implementing national laws and the CoE ResAPs, experts agreed that an update of the chemical and labelling requirements would be desirable. Risk perception is mainly based on the information given by tattooists, parents or friends, or read in mass media and internet. Among students, awareness about infectious risks seems to be higher that on non-infectious ones, but that knowledge is often only superficial. Many data gaps and research needs were identified. Key conclusions This report provides an up-to-date snapshot of the tattoo/PMU phenomenon. Due to the wide variety of legislative frameworks across Member States, some products can be sold in some MSs but not in others, because of different chemical or authorisation requirements, thus resulting in a fragmentation of the internal market. This might also have an impact on the protection of consumers' health. Tattooing is an increasing fashion phenomenon which already involves over 60 million Europeans. In parallel, removal procedures are becoming more frequent. Adverse health effects linked to the application and removal of tattoos are reported in the literature; in addition the potential long term effects of exposure to the chemicals in the inks are still unknown and might become critical with time due to the high number of tattooed people. To bring light into this unknown area, even if costly, epidemiological studies and research on the fate of ingredients in the whole body are needed. In particular, prospective cohort studies should be conducted to investigate the correlation between tattoos and possible carcinogenesis. Good Manufacturing Practices for manufacturing tattoo/PMU inks, as well as guidelines for their risk assessment should be developed. A full risk assessment of the ingredients, in particular colorants, used in tattoo/PMU inks is needed, including their phototoxicity, absorption level, distribution, metabolism and excretion, as well as Derived No Effect Level (DNEL), data which are largely missing so far. Further to this, it needs to be assessed whether the risks arising from the use of certain chemicals in tattoo/PMU inks are adequately controlled or need to be addressed by an EU measure. In the absence of this risk assessment, for azo pigments a precautionary approach would consist in not using those that contain in their structure aromatic amines classified as Carcinogenic, Mutagenic or Reprotoxic (CMR). Harmonised analytical methods should be developed to ensure reproducible results and allow a correct implementation of the chemical requirements of legislation in place. Market surveillance activities should be continued to identify hazardous products and be carried out also on products sold on-line. Additional information campaigns on risks for potential clients, particular targeted to teenagers and young people should be undertaken, allowing an informed choice. The training of tattooists should be compulsory and cover at least some key topics. The preparation of harmonised hygiene guidelines is highly recommended and inspections of studios required. The phenomenon of clandestine backyard tattooing should be stopped. Related and future JRC work Three detailed reports on specific part of this project were published in 2015 and 2016 [1 - 3]. JRC.
