Though the average citizen was relatively safe, gangland slayings of potential rivals did take place on occasion.|$|E

On the other hand, departments with higher-water-output effect of Beijing include manufacturing of transport equipment, mining of nonmetal ores, manufacturing of electrical machinery and instrument, manufacturing of instrument, apparatus and cultural and office work machinery, and production and supply of gas.

40|$|The current {{trend of}} {{electricity}} market deregulation ushers in increasingly dynamic electricity pricing schemes. The cost-optimal scheduling of industrial loads with accurate price forecasts is therefore important. However, {{results in the}} current literature suggest that mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) is poor at indicating the <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> of a forecast. This paper presents the <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> analysis of electricity price forecast on the day-ahead scheduling of load-shifting industrial plants. A coal-conveying system with storage {{is used as a}} case study. The research uses three price forecasting methods on the PJM's market prices over a period of two years. Rank correlation (RC) between the predicted price and the actual price is proposed as an indicator of <b>economic</b> <b>benefit.</b> The results show that RC is a better indicator of <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> than root mean square error (RMSE) and MAPE. They also show that potential <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> obtainable from forecasts depends on price volatility and not mean price. An artificial forecast is used to validate the superiority of RC over MAPE and RMSE. It is observed that the predictability of a forecast's <b>economic</b> <b>benefit</b> is largely dependent on how responsive the load is to electricity price changes...|$|R

Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the French National Assembly until 1945 and wielded limited influence in local governance.

5|$|Teller {{was one of}} {{the strongest}} and best-known advocates for {{investigating}} non-military uses of nuclear explosives, which the United States explored under Operation Plowshare. One of the most controversial projects he proposed was a plan to use a multi-megaton hydrogen bomb to dig a deep-water harbor more than a mile long and half a mile wide to use for shipment of resources from coal and oil fields through Point Hope, Alaska. The Atomic Energy Commission accepted Teller's proposal in 1958 and it was designated Project Chariot. While the AEC was scouting out the Alaskan site, and having withdrawn the land from the public domain, Teller publicly advocated the <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> of the plan, but was unable to convince local government leaders that the plan was financially viable.|$|E

5|$|As {{could be}} expected, {{immediately}} {{after he was}} inaugurated, Reitz contacted {{the government of the}} South African Republic with the objective to establish new and closer political ties. Already on 4 March 1889 the Orange Free State and the South African Republic concluded a treaty of common defence at Potchefstroom. Treaties about trade and the railways were to follow. Even earlier, in January 1889, the Volksraad charged Reitz to negotiate a customs treaty with both the British South African colonies and the South African Republic. On 20 March 1889 a Customs Conference was held in Bloemfontein which led to an agreement between the Orange Free State and the Cape Colony which was hugely beneficial for the former. The <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> grew further when new railway lines were opened between the Cape Colony and Bloemfontein (1890) and between Bloemfontein and Johannesburg (1892), directly connecting Cape Town with Johannesburg and turning the Orange Free State into a transit economy. For Reitz the development of a unified South African railway system was also a political goal: the railways as a means to diminish mutual distrust and create unity and mutual understanding between the white population of South Africa.|$|E
5|$|Because of the <b>economic</b> <b>benefits</b> of good {{telecommunication}} infrastructure, {{there is}} increasing worry about the inequitable access to telecommunication services amongst various countries of the world—this {{is known as the}} digital divide.

In terms of Internet access, roughly half of all countries have fewer than one out of 20 people with Internet access. From this information, as well as educational data, the ITU was able to compile an index that measures the overall ability of citizens to access and use information and communication technologies.
