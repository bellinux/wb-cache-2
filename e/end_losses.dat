50|$|A {{common problem}} with {{one-dimensional}} pinches is the <b>end</b> <b>losses.</b> Most {{of the motion}} of particles is along the magnetic field. With the θ-pinch and the screw-pinch, this leads particles out {{of the end of}} the machine very quickly, leading to a loss of mass and energy. On top of this problem, the Z-pinch has major stability problems. Though particles can be reflected to some extent with magnetic mirrors, even these allow many particles to pass. A common method of beating these <b>end</b> <b>losses,</b> is to bend the cylinder around into a torus. Unfortunately this breaks θ symmetry, as paths on the inner portion (inboard side) of the torus are shorter than similar paths on the outer portion (outboard side). Thus, a new theory is needed. This gives rise to the famous Grad-Shafranov equation. Numerical solutions to the Grad-Shafranov equation have also yielded some equilibria, most notably that of the reversed field pinch.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{stretched}} parabolic linear Fresnel reflector (SPLFR) collecting system. The primary optical mirror {{field of the}} SPLFR collecting system and the second-stage concentrator of compound parabolic collector are designed. The mirrors located at the parabolic line are close to each other, which effectively reduce {{the gap between the}} adjacent mirrors. The <b>end</b> <b>losses</b> of the receiver are very important, especially in a small-scale collecting system. A movable receiver is introduced for the reduction of the <b>end</b> <b>losses.</b> Moreover, a stretched structure of SPLFR is designed for wind resistance. Finally, the thermal performance of the SPLFR collecting system with fixed and movable receiver located in Guangzhou is tested. The maximum thermal efficiency obtained by this collecting system with movable receiver is 66 % which avoid the <b>end</b> <b>losses</b> effectively, and the solar collector thermal loss coefficient is 1. 32 W/m(2) degrees C. The results show that the SPLFR collecting system has excellent thermal performance and a promising application future. Meanwhile, this system will provide a valuable reference for concentrating solar power technology. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with an experimental study of a parabolic trough collector with its sun tracking system designed and manufactured utilizing the existing Saudi technologies and available local materials. For {{the design of the}} PTC frame, a finite element model has been developed and used to check the capability of the structure to absorb torsion and bending forces, under dead and wind loads.

The fabricated PTC and its tracking system were tested outdoors {{on the roof of the}} Mechanical Engineering Department, King Saud University, Riyadh. The experimental results obtained have shown that the obtained characteristic curve of the tested collector is considerably lower than that of a typical collector which can be attributed to the higher thermal losses for the lack of the evacuated glass envelop around the absorbing tube, the <b>end</b> <b>losses</b> of the collector, and the inaccuracy in tracking the sun.

40|$|For the {{compression}} of a cylindrical plasma by fast rising axial magnetic fields, the initial state of this plasma is {{of critical importance}} (1). Therefore experiments with a preheating discharge {{for the production of}} an initial plasma with known and reproducible properties were started at this laboratory simultaneously with the first experiments on {{the compression}} of a weakly preionized deuterium gas. An electrodeless ring discharge was chosen. The absence of electrodes makes a high degree of purity of the plasma possible. Kolb's experience with a preheating discharge for magnetic com-pression experiments (2) confirmed this conception and gave further impulse to this work. Early experiments were made with a RF-transmitter as current generator, in pulsed as weIl as in stationary operation. Dueto the low inductance of the compression coil considerable difficulties are met in coupling the RF power to the discharge. The maximum available power is limited to some hundred kilowatts. By discharging a low inductance condenser on the compression coil a damped RF pulse with apower of 100 M Watt is easily obtained. To avoid prefiring of the main condenser bank, the voltage of the coil must be lirnited. With the spark gaps used at this laboratory the maximum permissible voltage at the coil was about 5 kV. This voltage, however, is sufficient to start an electrodeless ring discharge in hydrogen. Investigations on this electrodeless ring discharge were made with and without a steady magnetic bias field in a wide pressure range. Preliminary results, concerning the breakdown of the gas, the formation of a highly ionized plasma, and the subsequent decay of the plasma dtie to <b>end</b> <b>losses</b> and recombination are reported in this paper...|$|E

T.), in 1946, that useful power might be generated from such reactions, pro-vided {{that the loss of}} energy to the walls could be sufficiently reduced by magnetic fields. Experiments were begun at Imperial College, London, in February 1947, to produce very large currents in a low-pressure gas discharge. The containment of the gas was to be achieved by the pinch effect and a toroidal discharge tube was used to eliminate <b>end</b> <b>losses.</b> Currents in the range 1 x 104 - 2 x 104 amp were induced in the gas by discharging a condenser of maximum energy 400 joules through a primary winding coupled with the gas. 1 These experiments were the first to demonstrate a marked pinch effect in a gas discharge, although inertial effects caused the contracting discharge to overswing and expand again, followed by further contractions and expansions. 2 In order to achieve {{temperatures of}} several million degrees and demonstrate a thermonuclear reaction it was clear from the Bennett 3 relation, 2 NkT = 72, that currents of the order 105 amp were required. (N is the total number of particles per unit length of the discharge, k Boltzmann's constant, T the tempera-ture and / the current.) When, however, the condenser energy was increased in 1950 to 18, 000 joules, serious crazing and evaporation of the small Pyrex glass dis-charge tubes occurred and it became necessary to develop superior materials to contain the large currents.
