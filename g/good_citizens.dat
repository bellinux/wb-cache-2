5|$|His {{influence}} can {{as well be}} seen in Ecuadorian {{thought in}} general, as his work {{has been one of}} its principal influences; Ecuadorian education, as he promoted new pedagogical ideas, such as the creation of <b>good</b> <b>citizens</b> instead of merely imparting knowledge, and finally Ecuadorian science, as he was, along with Pedro Vicente Maldonado, one of the two most important scientists of colonial Ecuador. Espejo analyzed the reality of colonial Quito, the poverty of its people and their lack of good education, and he denounced the corruption of the colonial authorities.|$|E

Aristotle makes a distinction between the <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> and the <b>good</b> man, writing, [...] "...there cannot be a single absolute excellence of the <b>good</b> <b>citizen.</b> But the <b>good</b> man is so called in virtue of a single absolute excellence. It is thus clear that it is possible to be a <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> without possessing the excellence which is the quality of a good man." [...] Specifically, in his view, the <b>good</b> <b>citizen</b> is measured in relation to ruling and being ruled, the good man only in ruling. Some of the ambiguity is likely due to more than one Greek word being translated [...] "good." ...|$|R

Educating Scouts in HIV and AIDS is vitally important due to the large number of infections in both rural and urban areas of South Africa.|$|E

25|$|The {{construction}} of the railway line from Port Darwin to Pine Creek in the late 1880s required the immigration of Chinese labour. In December 1888, the South Australian Chinese Immigration Act came into effect, effectively putting a stop to the immigration increase. Those Chinese workers already in Darwin had proved themselves reliable, hard-working and <b>good</b> <b>citizens.</b> After {{the decline of the}} gold rush, the Chinese population competed for jobs with the White population. Not only did Asians compete successfully against Europeans for jobs that were scarce, but they also diversified into other profitable areas such as vegetable growing and tailoring. Consequently, the retail trade was almost entirely in Chinese hands and their success was resented by Europeans.|$|E

500|$|In the prewar years, {{the history}} of Poland was contested terrain as {{different}} ideological forces pulled Polish nationalists in opposite directions, represented by Dmowski and Piłsudski. Throughout his career, Dmowski deeply disliked Piłsudski and {{much of what he}} stood for. Dmowski came from an impoverished urban background and had little fondness for Poland's traditional elitist social structure. Instead, Dmowski favored a modernizing program and felt Poles should stop looking back nostalgically at the old Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which Dmowski held in deep contempt and should instead embrace the [...] "modern world". In particular, Dmowski despised the old Commonwealth for its multi-national structure and religious tolerance. He saw the ethnic minorities in Poland as a direct threat to the cultural identity, integrity and ethnic cohesion of Poland, directly in competition with the Polish petit bourgeoisie with which he identified. Dmowski argued that <b>good</b> <b>citizens</b> should only have one allegiance to the nation, and there is no middle ground. In his ideal Poland there would be no ethnic minorities, they would either be polonized or forced to emigrate. The success of his nationalistic ideas, also adopted and propagated by nationalists in other countries (such as Lithuania and Ukraine) contributed to the disappearance of the tolerant, multicultural Polish-Lithuanian identity.|$|E
