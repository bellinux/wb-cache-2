Objective: To assess the effectiveness of a programmable cranially implanted closed-loop neurostimulation system in the control of seizures originating from an area relatively inaccessible by open craniotomy. Method: A patient with drug-resistant partial epilepsy had previously undergone open resection of the left frontal opercular cortex and the underlying insular area. Although subdural-depth electrode ictal recordings had been nonlocalizing, <b>depth</b> <b>electrode</b> insular stimulation had produced the patient's habitual aura. Postoperatively, there was a sustained 50 % reduction in seizure frequency. The residual seizures were identical to the preoperative seizures.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} using MR imaging chronic {{changes in}} the brain parenchyma after electroencephalography <b>depth</b> <b>electrode</b> placement in patients with medically refractory epilepsy. METHODS: A retrospective review of MR scans in 57 patients who underwent stereotactic placement of 210 depth electrodes was performed. Scans were evaluated for evidence of gliosis, hemorrhage, or infection along the probe tracts. RESULTS: Signal abnormalities along the probe tracts were seen in 38 patients (67 %). Of the 210 probe tracts evaluated on long-repetition-time images, 85 (41 %) were associated with punctate hyperintensity and four (2 %) with punctate hypointensity; 120 (57 %) showed no MR changes to suggest prior electrode placement. One probe placement was complicated by a significant intraparenchymal hemorrhage. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Depth</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation for electroencephalography monitoring results in imperceptible or minimal chronic changes as detected by MR in almost all patients.

In spite of their usefulness, safety of <b>depth</b> <b>electrodes</b> is disputed, {{and the number of}} insertions is decreasing. This study examined retrospectively possible deleterious effects such as perioperative complications, induction of epileptogenesis, and neuropsychologic deficits. Methods: Clinical course and neuroradiologic findings of 115 patients with bilaterally inserted longitudinal intrahippocampal <b>depth</b> <b>electrodes</b> (IDEs) were analyzed. Hippocampal resection specimens were examined histopathologically. To detect newly developed epileptogenic areas, EEG recordings, seizure control, and semiology after standardized resection procedures were compared between patients who received IDEs and those who did not. To demonstrate functional deficits caused by IDE insertion into an unaffected hippocampus of the speech-dominant hemisphere, changes of verbal learning and memory performances before and after right amygdalohippocampectomy were compared between patients evaluated with and without IDEs. Results: Five significant complications without any permanent neurologic deficit were noted, and only one was specifically linked to IDE insertion. The tissue damage associated with the insertion was minimal and sharply circumscribed. No differences of seizure outcome after standardized resections were identified between patients with and without IDEs.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Accessing the {{hippocampus}} for amygdalohippocampectomy and procedures such as <b>depth</b> <b>electrode</b> placement requires accurate knowledge regarding {{the location of}} {{the hippocampus}}. METHODS: The authors removed 10 human cadaveric brains (20 sides) from their crania, noted relationships between the lateral temporal neocortex and underlying hippocampus, and measured the distance between the hippocampus and superficial landmarks. RESULTS: Mean distances were as follows: 3. 8 cm from the tip of the temporal lobe {{to the head of the}} hippocampus; 6. 5 cm from the tip of the temporal lobe to the junction of the fornix and hippocampus; and 3. 5 cm between the tail and head of the hippocampus. The head of the hippocampus ranged from 0 to 5 mm inferior to the inferior temporal sulcus. The tail of the hippocampus ranged from 2. 2 to 7 mm superior to the inferior temporal sulcus. In two specimens, the tail was deep to the superior temporal sulcus. Generally the length of the hippocampus was along the inferior temporal sulcus and inferior aspect of the middle temporal gyrus. The hippocampus tended to be more superiorly located and shorter in females and left sides, but this was not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: Additional landmarks for localizing the underlying hippocampus may be helpful in temporal lobe surgery. Our study showed relatively constant anatomic landmarks between the hippocampus and overlying temporal cortex that may help localize the hippocampus during amygdalohippocampectomy and <b>depth</b> <b>electrode</b> implantation, verify the accuracy of image-guided methods, and used as adjuvant methodologies when these latter technologies are unavailable...|$|E

After consecutive intravenous (i. v.) administration of 200 and 375 mg thiopental (5 min apart), spike activation and suppression of preexisting spike activity were assessed quantitatively, and changes in drug-induced beta-activity were evaluated qualitatively. After 375 mg thiopental, 16 of 21 patients with SDSE and 17 of 21 patients with IDE showed a spike activation. In 9 of 16 patients with spike activation in the strip electrodes and in 8 of 17 patients with spike activation in the <b>depth</b> <b>electrodes,</b> the activation correlated with the region of ictal onset. Focal reduction of drug-induced beta-activity was noted in 6 patients, corresponding in 4 of them to the epileptogenic focus. In 9 patients, preexisting spike activity was suppressed.

Dependent on the individual requirements, these different electrode types were used alone or in combination. Multiple strip electrodes with 4 to 16 contacts were implanted in 157 cases through burrholes, grids with up to 64 contacts in 15 cases via boneflaps, and intrahippocampal <b>depth</b> <b>electrodes</b> in 36 cases using stereotactic procedures.

We did not encounter any permanent morbidity or mortality in our series. In our experience, EEG-monitoring with chronically implanted electrodes is a feasible technique which contributes essentially to the exact localization of the epileptogenic focus, since it allows nearly artefact-free recording of the ictal and interictal activity.

The conclusions reached from the analysis of these recordings rely on the accuracy of electrode localization in relationship to brain anatomy.

High frequency components along with alpha and beta bands recorded from electrodes located near the primary motor cortex wall of central sulcus and electrodes passing through sensory cortex were found to be the most useful for classification of force versus rest although one participant did have significant modulation in the insular cortex.
