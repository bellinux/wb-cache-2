The method is illustrated using two CFD codes, PARC and CFL 3 D, and examining {{their ability to}} preserve lift and drag coefficients along grid line defined integration paths.

Plunge milling is very good method for rough machining process of complex shape or free form shapes like impeller parts. In multi axis plunge milling, the optimization of plunge cutter section selection and generating the tool path for free form surface {{is very important to}} improve the efficiency and effectiveness. In plunge milling, after each plunge the milling cutter is offset by some value and then the material surface is removed in the form of lunula. The material removal rate is computed by area of lunula and the feed rate. At the entry and exit of milling cutter, the radial offset has not any influence on the condition of surface. At the maximum cutting velocity, the surface obtained is clean whatever the feed rate per tooth on entry but on exit the high value of feed rate gives the deteriorated surface. The surface roughness value always increases with feed rate in plunge milling.The simulation of dynamic uncut chip thickness which is generated by plunge milling can be done by tracking the position of plunge cutter center. This simulation shows the regenerative effect with variation of phase difference. Then the model of uncut chip thickness and cutting <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> with cutting edge radius are entered into time domain model. Finally, with the help of time domain solution the stability of machine and vibrations are estimated.The cutting parameters {{play a key role in}} plunge milling.

When the bottom gap ratio is 0, the drag <b>force</b> <b>coefficient,</b> lift <b>force</b> <b>coefficient,</b> and composite force reach their maximum values, and the azimuth reaches its minimum. With an increase of the bottom gap ratio from 0 to 1, the drag <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> and composite force decrease sharply, and the lift <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> does not decreases so much, but the azimuth increases dramatically. With a continuous increase of the bottom gap ratio from 1 upward, the drag <b>force</b> <b>coefficient,</b> lift <b>force</b> <b>coefficient,</b> composite force, and azimuth vary little.

40|$|Experiments on {{the effects}} of {{conditions}} at the tip of an axisymmetric body on the vortex wake of the body at large angle of attack in incompressible flow have been performed. The separation patterns that occur at the nose of a cone with a hemispherical tip have been documented for ranges of Reynolds number based on tip radius and of relative angle of attack. Tips with cross sections that vary smoothly from elliptic to circular have been designed and tested on a cone. The effectiveness of the tips in varying the cone side <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> as the tip is rotated has been demonstrated. The relation between tip roll angle and side <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> {{has been shown to be}} essentially independent of Reynolds number, for the range of Reynolds number tested, as well as cone base conditions and roll direction. The relation between tip roll angle and side <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> has been shown to be a strong function of angle of attack. The reasons for nonsmooth variation of side <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> with tip roll angle at higher angles of attack have been determined by examinations of the vortex wake geometry. Peaks in the magnitude of the side <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> after zero crossings have been shown to be caused by a rapid shift in the wake vortices away from a symmetric configuration as the tip rotates away from a symmetry condition. Reductions in magnitude of the side <b>force</b> <b>coefficient</b> between magnitude peaks have been demonstrated to be a result of the near vortex crossing over the cone centerline. This vortex crossover has been shown to occur near and after the breakaway from the cone of the far vortex.

High-order spectral/hp element methods, which use a discontinuous Galerkin discretisation of the compressible Navier-Stokes equations, are now increasingly being used to improve the accuracy of flow simulations and thus the <b>force</b> <b>coefficients.</b> To reduce error in the calculated <b>force</b> <b>coefficients</b> whilst keeping computational cost minimal, we propose a p-adaptation method where the degree of the approximating polynomial is locally increased in the regions of the flow where low resolution is identified using a goal-based error estimator as follows. Given an objective functional such as the aerodynamic <b>force</b> <b>coefficients,</b> we use control theory to derive an adjoint problem which provides {{the sensitivity of the}} functional with respect to changes in the flow variables, and assume that these changes are represented by the local truncation error.

Both flow governing and adjoint equations are solved by the same high-order method, where we allow the degree of the polynomial within an element to vary across the mesh. We initially calculate a steady-state solution to the governing equations using a low polynomial order and use the goal-based error indicator to identify parts of the computational domain that require improved solution accuracy which is achieved by increasing the approximation order.
