40|$|After the {{establishment}} of the N-S Andib-Ganamub trough, the ubiquitous Lower Nosib subarkose was succeeded in the west by the Upper Nosib greywacke which indicates that orthogeosynclinal subsidence was already active in pre-Damara times. A pulse of NNE folding (F₁N) concluded this sedinentary cycle and was accompanied by amphibolite-grade metamorphism (M₁), occasional migmatisation (A₁), and later feldspar blastesis. This episode was most intense in the west, so that the overlying Damara rocks paraconformable in the east, are unconformable there. Martin's (1965) separation of the succeeding Damara basin into a western <b>eugeosyncline</b> and an eastern miogeosyncline applies very well to this area, though the separating hinge-line appears to have been located farther to the west (± 80 Km) of the Kamanjab inlier, along the western flank of a N-S geanticlinal belt. The Lower Bakos semipelite and lenticular carbonate, thinning out against the eastern flank of this positive element controlling the deposition, may, prior to deformation, have created a transition between the western eugeosynclinal greywacke and the eastern miogeosynclinal Lower Otari carbonates. The fractured hinge-zone provided channels for the ascent of syndepositional intrusions and volcanics. Regional erosion following upwarping in the east caused a large influx of detritus into the Khomas furrow prior to the disconformable deposition of the Tillite Substage, which is the only reliable chronostratigraphic link between the base of the Upper Otavi and that of the Upper Bakos Series, the latter partially intertongueing with the succeeding Khomas Series. Gravitational creeping of the miogeosynclinal carbonates down the western slope of the upwarped Kamanjab inlier towards the sinking basin, produced the first folding (F₂O) in the east. Almost contemporaneously, buoyant uplifting forces, related to anatexis (A₂) along the axis of the <b>eugeosyncline,</b> created slopes sufficient to convey nappes (F₂S) of scarcely metamorphosed Damara schists towards the eastern foreland, overriding the miogeosyncline along the N-S Sesfontein Thrust. Eastern foredeeps were rapidly filled by the Mulden molasse. Steep slip folding (F₂S and F₄) in the cores and roots, and the formation of scattered domes at depth, controlled the successive structural evolution of the nappes. Large-scale axial undulations were later produced by orthogonally superposed F₃ folds striking east. The Damaran metamorphism (M₂), which outlasted deformation, has a Barrovian character and grades in the Damara sediments from amphibolite (sillimanite) grade in the west to greenschist (sericite- chlorite) grade in the east. In the previously dehydrated, deformed and metamorphosed, polymetamorphic (M₁/M₂) Nosib terrains, retrograde parageneses and transition granulites developed to the east and {{to the west of the}} Damaran hornblende-oligoclase isograd respectively. The Damaran tectono-thermal episode culminated in advanced migmatisation of the Khomas greywacke (possibly equivalent to the Salem granite-gneiss) and final anatexis (A₂) in the late-kinematic Ganias -Uhima (possibly equivalent to the Donkerhoek) granite, followed by widespread feldspar blastesis. The drop in rheomorphism in the deformed mass at the margin of the migmatite zone induced intense shearing and produced belts of mylonite and cataclastic gneiss. At a later stage, the Sesfontein Thrust was buffered against the Otavi dolomite relief and its speed of advancement reduced to match that of the erosion of its frontal toe, which now separates two completely different structural-stratigraphic domains: i) an eastern miogeosynclinal, feebly metamorphosed and volcanic-free domain (Damara System, Outjo Facies) deformed into non-basement-involving tectonites, overridden by ii) a western domain of suprastructural nappes and metamorphosed eugeosynclinal sediments (Damara System, Swakop Facies) deformed in response to basementinvolving tectonic processes promoted by deeply seated anatexis along the axis of the former <b>eugeosyncline.</b> The present model involves many stratigraphic revisions, one of the most important being that no rocks older than the Nosib Formation outcrop in the area and possibly along most of the Damara mobile belt in the western Kaokoveld...|$|E

40|$|Two {{fundamentally}} different {{views on the}} origin of the sialic crust of the earth are possible. According to one view the sialic crust has been produced from the inside by progressive physico-chemical differentiation of the earth's material into concentric spheres. Such an endogenic origin of the crust is supported by most contemporaneous geological theories. According to the other view the crust has been acquired from the outside, shortly after the earth's agglomeration, as an outer layer of more acid satellitic material. This exogenic origin of the crust is suggested by Berlage's theory {{on the origin of}} the planetary system. In this paper it is attempted to test Berlage's astronomical theory by means of geonomical facts. It appears that the postulate of the acquisition of the crustal matter from the outside leads to a satisfactory theoretical model of the earth's evolution. Three major phases can be distinguished: 1. (I) The acquisition of an acid layer from without. 2. (II) Its transformation. 3. (III) Its incorporation (see Fig. 1). An important aspect of this model is that it provides a synthesis of the two main trends in the geological thought of our time, the fixistic concepts (recently represented, for example, by Subbotin et al., 1965 a,b,c), and the mobilistic concepts (recently represented, for example, by Blackett et al., 1965). This synthesis is obtained by means of the relativistic principle in the analysis of the crustal movements and deformations. The effects of the causative mass displacements at various depths, and occurring at various times, are superimposed on each other. The processes in depth produce in combination the structural phenomena observable at the surface. The Alpine cycle of orogeny is analysed according to this relativistic principle (Fig. 3). The influence of mega-, geo- and meso-undations can be distinguished. The mega-undations are generated in the lower mantle. They cause the “Tethys-Twist” and the continental drift, which is accompanied by mega-shears and the formation of new ocean basins (Atlantic type of oceanization). The geo-undations are related to physico-chemical processes, which occur in {{the upper part of the}} upper mantle (the asthenosphere). They result in the formation of <b>eugeosynclines,</b> accompanied by ophiolitic magmatism (the eugeosynclinal phase). Thereafter, centres of orogeny are formed in the geosynclinal area by subcrustal mass circuits, which corrode the crust from beneath (Mediterranean type of oceanization). By this penetrative type of convection, the overlying crustal matter (covered by geosynclinal sediments) is rafted outward from these centres. Meanwhile migmatized sialic matter is injected sidewards into the flysch foredeeps. This tectogenesis produces nappe structures of East Alpine and Pennine character (flysch phase). Finally, an isostatic equilibration of the matter that accumulated in the foredeeps produced meso-undations, namely the uplift of the Alpine mountain ranges and the subsidence of sidedeeps (molasse phase, see Fig. 4 and 5). An analysis of the present picture of the structural features of the earth (Fig. 6) confirms the concept that the seemingly opposed mobilistic and fixistic mechanical models should be combined into a synthesis of relativistic character. During the third phase of the earth's geological evolution (the last half billion years of its history), the sialic crust is progressively incorporated into the upper mantle by means of the Mediterranean type of oceanization. The crustal fragments thereby acquired a greater freedom of movement and they started drifting towards the Pacific area (Pacifico-petal drift), opening new oceanic basins in their wake (the Atlantic type of oceanization). The expectation of this relativistic model of the earth's evolution appears to conform to the diagnostic data of the post-war geonomic researches, so that this hypothesis deserves further elaboration and testing...|$|R
40|$|Studies of the Late Palaeozoic <b>eugeosyncline</b> in Japan {{have taken}} effort {{based on the}} {{researches}} chiefly of the formations on South Kitakami belt and the formations of calcareous facies in Southwest Japan. In the Tanba belt, Upper Palaeozoic formations of non-calcareous facies develop extensively and typically, and have been studied by several geologists. The central district in the belt, however, has been far behind other districts in the research of the strata, owing to paucity of the fossils, monotonous character of the lithology, and the complicated geologic structure which makes geological survey very troublesome. In this study, the way of investigation of sequence of these strata was examined. The internal sedimentary structures of the clastic beds, the character of crevices in the bedded chert, and the relation among the manganese ore bed and the chert beds, etc., were noticed as proofs of the stratigraphyical sequence of the strata. Thus, the sequence of the Palaeozoic formations was determined in descending order as follows. g. shale-sandstone formation 220 m+ f. schalstein formation 600 〜 1200 m e. shale formation 750 m d. chert-shale formation 500 〜 640 m c. shale formation 500 〜 600 m b. chert formation 670 〜 700 m a. shale formation 350 m+ A limestone lens of the schalstein (f) yields Pseudo-fusulina sp [...] The Palaeozic formations in this district is regarded, as a whole, to belong to Permian in age, and can be correlated to the middle and {{the lower part of}} "the Tanba group" of SAKAGUCHI (1952).

40|$|Before {{the theory}} of plate {{tectonics}} took hold, there was no coherent model for ocean-continent transitions that included both extant continental margins and fragmentary ancient examples preserved in orogenic belts. Indeed, during the early 1900, two strands of thought developed, one relying on the antiquity and permanence of continents and oceans, advocated by the mainstream {{of the scientific community}} and one following mobilist concepts derived from Wegener's hypothesis (1915) of continental drift. As an illustration of the prevailing North-American view, the different composition and thickness of continental and oceanic crust and the resulting isostatic response showed "how improbable it would be to suppose that a continent could founder or go to oceanic depth or that ocean floor at ± 3000 fathoms could ever have been a stable land area since the birth of the oceans" [H. H. Hess, Trans. R. Soc. London, A 222 (1954) 341 - 348]. Because of the perceived permanence of oceans and continents, mountain chains were thought to originate from narrow, elongated, unstable belts, the geosynclines, circling the continents or following "zones of crustal weakness" within them, from which geanticlines and finally mountain belts would develop. This teleological concept, whereby a geosyncline would inevitably evolve into a mountain chain, dominated geological interpretations of orogenic belts for several decades in the mid-twentieth century. However, the concept of permanence of oceans and continents and the concept of the geosyncline had already met with the critiques of Suess and others. As early as 1905, Steinmann considered the association of peridotite, "diabase" (basalt/dolerite) and radiolarite (a typical ocean-continent transition assemblage), present in the Alps and Apennines, as characteristic of the deep-ocean floor and Bailey (1936) placed Steinmann's interpretation into the context of continental drift and orogeny. Indeed, in both authors' writings, the concept of ophiolites as ocean crust is apparent. Between 1920 and 1930, the stage was thus potentially set for modern mobilist concepts that were, however, to prove attractive to only a small circle of Alpine and peri-Gondwanian geologists. After the Second World War, the 1950 s saw the rapid progress of the geophysical and geological exploration of oceans and continental margins that provided the data for a reevaluation of the geosynclinal concept. Actualistic models now equated the former preorogenic miogeosyncline of Stille (1940) and Kay (1951) with passive continental margins [C. L. Drake, M. Ewing, G. H. Sutton, Continental margin and geosynclines: the east coast of North America, north of Cape Hatteras, in: L. Ahrens, et al. (Eds.), Physics and Chemistry of the Earth  3, Pergamon Press, London, 1959, pp.   110 - 189], the (American version of the) <b>eugeosyncline</b> and its igneous rocks with "collapsing continental rises" [R. S. Dietz, J. Geol. 71 (1963) 314 - 333] and the ophiolites, the Steinmann Trinity, of the (European) <b>eugeosyncline</b> with fragments of oceanic lithosphere [H. H. Hess, History of ocean basins, in: Petrologic Studies: a Volume to Honor A. F. Buddington, Geol. Soc. Am., New York. 1962, pp. 599 - 620]. The concept of sea-floor spreading [H. H. Hess, History of ocean basins, in: Petrologic Studies: a Volume to Honor A. F. Buddington, Geol. Soc. Am., New York. 1962, pp. 599 - 620; H. H. Hess, Mid-oceanic ridges and tectonics of the sea-floor, in: W. F. Whittard, R. Bradshaw (Eds), Submarine Geology and Geophysics, Colston Papers 17, Butterworths, London, 1965, pp. 317 - 333] finally eliminated the weaknesses in Wegener's hypothesis and, with the coming of the "annus mirabilis" of 1968, the concept of the geosyncline could be laid to rest. Ocean-continent transitions of modern oceans, as revealed by seismology and deep-sea drilling, could now be compared with the remnants of their ancient counterparts preserved in the Alps and elsewhere. © 2008 Académie des sciences...|$|E

Plate 3; Composite {{columnar}} section of Paleozoic strata exposed in the Pancake Range. Approximately 10, 000 feet of Devonian through Permian strata are exposed beneath Tertiary volcanic rocks in the Pancake Range. An incomplete section of Devonian Guilmette Formation exposes 1, 420 feet of limestone. The Mississippian Chainman Shale, 1, 230 feet of black shale, is overlain by the Scotty Wash Quartzite. Though the Scotty Wash is incomplete, 2, 186 feet of basal shale and quartzite are exposed, as are 891 feet {{of the top of}} the formation. The overlying Diamond Peak Formation, comprising 993 feet of black shale, quartzite, and chert-clast conglomerate, is the youngest Mississippian clastic unit exposed. The Ely Limestone is divided into four members. Member A is 305 feet of argillaceous limestone containing Rhipidomella nevadensis, a Chester guide fossil. Member B contains 475 feet of Morrow limestone. Limestones of Member C are 1, 738 feet thick; 886 feet of these strata are Morrow, and 852 feet are Derry rocks that lie above the Chaetetes-Profusulinella faunizone. Member D is Derry to Desmoines (?), and comprises a maximum of 866 feet of conglomeratic limestone. Member D either lenses out, or is truncated by a regional unconformity, or both. The Permian Rib Hill Sandstone contains 822 feet of siltstone and sandstone; the top of the formation has been eroded. Tertiary ignimbrites and basalts unconformably overlie folded Paleozoic strata. The upper Paleozoic section is involved in an eastward-overturned, south-plunging syncline striking N 30 ?? W. Western truncation of the fold indicates possible northern extension of a major range-front fault. Stratigraphic and structural information from the Pancake Range, when integrated with regional data, show that orogeny was continuous in the Cordilleran geosyncline since the Antler orogeny began. Orogenic movement began in central Nevada in the Upper Devonian, gradually moved eastward through eastern Nevada and western Utah in the Permian through Jurassic, then into central Utah in the Cretaceous. Thus, orogeny began in the <b>eugeosyncline</b> and passed through the miogeosyncline toward the shelf in a wave-like progression...|$|E
40|$|Invicta area {{is located}} north of Lima {{in the western}} {{cordillera}} of the Peruvian Andes, within the <b>eugeosyncline</b> of the geosyncline Andean Mesozoic basin in the contact between the intrusive rocks of the Coastal Batholith and the volcanic rocks of Calipuy group, locating mineralized structures in both lithologies, with economic metals Au, Cu, Ag, Pb and Zn of current economic interest. 	In this area the mineral deposit of Invicta comprises i) the generation of the last pulse of calc-alkaline intrusions of the Coastal Batholith with ages around 30 million years. The initial phase of the batholith magmatism generative dates and related to compressive orogenic movements of the Peruvian phase occurred in upper Cretaceous with ages approximately 100 million years. ii) Generation of the volcanic rocks of Calipuy formation with ages somewhat lower than the pulses of hydrothermal solutions generated by the intrusive. Apparently the final pulses of the Batholith and the Calipuy volcanic was driven by movements of compressive deformation of the Inca phase during the lower to middle tertiary. iii) Finally the generation of hydrothermal fluids from the residual solutions rich in silica and metal ions, originated in the last intrusional pulses of the Batholith, and they originated the mineralization in mineral deposit of Invicta. 	The fluid inclusion study shows three populations of mineralizing fluids recognized by different temperature ranging from 150 to 450 ºC and salinities ranging from 0 to 21 % eq. NaCl, which has allowed an overlay of events with mineral interest. This fact, together with favorable host igneous lithology and faulting systems as channels gatherer for the deposition of mineralizing fluids, have encouraged the formation of this mineral deposit. 	Invicta is tentatively classified as a Cordillerano mineral deposit type, of epigenetic origin mainly mesothermal to epithermal range. The Wilkinson diagram of salinity vs. homogenization shows a complex distribution of mineralization in this mineral deposit, which falls mainly in the mesothermal field with gradations to epithermal field. 10 	The column previously recognized with economic mineralization in Atenea Vein is 600 m; with a paleorelief would be about 400 m above the present surface, making a total column of 1000 m. in the vertical. This fact and the different phase of mineralization superimposed with different degrees of temperature and salinity, open up important exploratory opportunities in depth, in Atenea vein mainly towards the southwest {{as well as in}} other veins, which will be pointing to the continuation of detailed investigations in the laboratory and confirmed by exploration with diamond drilling and other complementary studies. El área de Invicta, se encuentra al norte de Lima en la cordillera occidental de los andes peruanos, dentro del eugeosinclinal de la cuenca geosinclinal andina del Mesozoico, en el contacto entre las rocas intrusivas del Batolito de la Costa y las rocas volcánicas del grupo Calipuy, localizándose las estructuras mineralizadas en ambas litologías, con metales económicos de Au, Cu, Ag, Pb y Zn de interés económico actual. 	En esta área el yacimiento Invicta, comprende i) la generación de las últimas pulsaciones de los intrusivos calcoalcalinos del Batolito de la Costa, con edades de alrededor de los 30 millones de años. La etapa inicial generativa del magmatismo del batolito, se remonta y relaciona con los movimientos compresivos orogénicos de la fase peruana ocurridos en el Cretácico superior con edades de aproximadamente de 100 millones de años. ii) la generación de las rocas volcánicas de la formación Calipuy, con edades algo menores a los pulsos de las soluciones hidrotermales generadas por los intrusivos. Aparentemente los pulsos magmáticos finales del batolito y de los volcánicos Calipuy, fueron impulsados por los movimientos de deformación compresiva de la fase Incaica durante el Terciario inferior a medio; iii) finalmente la generación de los fluidos hidrotermales a partir de las soluciones residuales ricas en iones metálicos y sílice, originadas en los últimos pulsos intrusionales del batolito, produjeron la mineralización del yacimiento Invicta. 	El estudio de inclusiones fluidas, muestra tres poblaciones de fluidos mineralizantes reconocidas por los distintos grados de temperatura que van desde los 150 a 450 ºC y salinidades que van de 0 a 21 % eq. peso NaCl, lo cual ha permitido una superposición de eventos con mineral de interés. Este hecho unido a la litología ígnea huésped favorable y a los sistemas de fallamiento como canales recolectores en la depositación de los fluidos mineralizantes, han favorecido la formación de este depósito mineral. 	Tentativamente se clasifica a Invicta, como un yacimiento de tipo Cordillerano, de origen epigenético fundamentalmente de rango mesotermal a epitermal. De acuerdo al diagrama de Wilkinson de homogeneización vs salinidad, muestra una compleja 8 distribución de la mineralización de este yacimiento, que cae principalmente en el campo mesotermal con gradación al campo epitermal...|$|E
