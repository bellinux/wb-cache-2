500|$|Debate over Trescothick's {{place in}} the England squad {{continued}} amid an end-of-series reshuffle in the England batting lineup. This included the dropping of fellow opener Strauss from the one-day side, {{and the rise of}} Alastair Cook as a Test and ODI opener for England. Trescothick stated that he would see how he progresses before committing to the international scene: [...] "Of course I'd love to play for England again.... Clearly, if I want to continue my career I have to undertake another tour. But for now, if and when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> full fitness and I think I am OK and ready to play, I'll make myself available for England." [...] He added that he was [...] "desperate to play for England again" [...] but was waiting until he was [...] "as convinced as I can be that I am ready to take on the challenge of international cricket".|$|E

6000|$|... "That I will," [...] the boy said. [...] "Every time <b>I</b> <b>gets</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> port, I'll write; and you'll write sometimes, won't you? And {{tell me how}} you are, and how {{every one}} is, {{schoolmaster}} and all. They have all been very kind to me, and I have nothing to say against any of them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "This Crabtree must {{certainly}} {{be as bad}} as you represent," [...] he said. [...] "I will have a talk with him when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our camp." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Chicago," [...] he perorated, [...] "I'm {{going to}} get a job and stick to it till hell freezes over. Then I'll go {{tramping}} again." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm driving over to {{the other}} side of the island. I'll start at five, but I don't expect <b>I</b> shall <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> dinner till late." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course," [...] replied Jenny tartly. [...] "He eats {{nothing but}} insects, and he catches them flying. Now <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my duties at home." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I must work! I mustn't stay here; <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my studies. Life is {{slipping}} by me, and I am doing nothing, being nothing!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Pardon me, {{you are not}} in a {{position}} to judge at all. You don't know what I mean to do as soon as <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the rectory." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Frank; [...] "I suppose so; and I mean to {{go along}} all square, aunt, and no mistake. When <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Cambridge, I'll read like bricks." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Friends, by all means," [...] I answered, [...] "but <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Paris to-night. A {{messenger}} from Madame Richard {{is already}} {{waiting for me}} in London." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Not this trip," [...] {{said the}} captain. [...] "I'll {{send it to}} you C.O.D. when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Buenas Tierras. Here comes that capstanfooted lubber with the chewin'. I ought to've weighed anchor an hour ago." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are most}} kind," [...] said Sybil, [...] "but if <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the town through Mowbray Park, I think I might do {{something}} for my father!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's all rumour. You shouldn't pay any attention. I should hardly think he's {{been such}} a fool. I only know that <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my wife. Good-night." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It's a long story. I've been a {{prisoner}} twice, and I was afraid I was about done {{for when the}} guards up and ran away from the prison and let me and a crowd of Cubans escape. How can <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> my ship?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Gosnell {{responded that}} [...] "the point is well made." [...] As a {{business}} person and alderman often limited the public's access to him. [...] "There were {{times in the}} past, and I'm {{the first to admit}} it, where <b>I</b> didn't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> people as quickly as I could. And in some cases <b>I</b> didn't <b>get</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> them at all because along the way the message got lost or whatever." [...] Marc Emery laid another charge that [...] "Gosnell was elected because of his good looks and his father's name. (Tom) has 3 years to prove that wrong." ...|$|R
