40|$|Abstract—We {{develop a}} web {{application}} vulnerability metric {{based on the}} combined reports of 4 leading commercial black box vulnerability scanners and evaluate this metric using historical benchmarks and our new sample of applications. We then use this metric to {{examine the impact of}} three factors on web application security: provenance (developed by startup company or freelancers), <b>developer</b> <b>security</b> knowledge, and programming language. Our study evaluates 27 web applications developed by programmers from 19 Silicon Valley startups and 8 outsourcing freelancers using 5 programming languages. We correlate the expected vulnerability rate of a Web application with whether it is developed by startup company or freelancers, the extent of <b>developer</b> <b>security</b> knowledge (assessed by a simple quiz), and the programming language used. We provide statistical confidence measures and find several results with statistical significance. For example, applications written in PHP are more prone to severe vulnerabilities, especially injection, and applications developed by freelancers tend to have more injection vulnerabilities. Our summary results provide guidance to developers that we believe may improve the security of future web applications.

40|$|Abstract—Agile {{methods are}} widely {{employed}} to develop high-quality software, but theoretical analyses argue that agile methods are inadequate for security-critical projects. However, most agile-developed software today needs to satisfy baseline security requirements, {{so that we}} need to focus on how to achieve this this level for typical agile projects. In this paper, we provide insights from the practitioner’s perspective on security in agile development and report on exploratory, qualitative findings from interviews. Our findings extend the theoretical prior work and suggest to focus on adequate customer involvement, <b>developer</b> <b>security</b> awareness and expertise, and continuously improving the development process for security.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{the factors that}} motivate and enable successful vulnerability discovery {{and the role of}} vulnerability markets. This is done by studying the career, motivation and methods of the most successful vulnerability discoverers. Vulnerability discovery takes considerable expertise. Some vulnerabilities, if exploited, can cause enormous damage to an organization, a segment of the economy, or even national <b>security.</b> Software <b>developers,</b> <b>security</b> organizations and government agencies are continuously engaged in efforts to prevent improper disclosure of vulnerabilities that can lead to zero-day exploitations. We observe that a major percentage of vulnerabilities are discovered by individuals external to software development organizations. We identify the top vulnerability discoverers throughout the past 12 years, and examine their motivation and methods. We observe that financial reward is a major motivation, especially to discoverers in Eastern Europe [...] The paper studies the actual vulnerability market, rather than the hypothetical markets often studied in recent literature...|$|R
40|$|Attack–defense trees {{can be used}} as part {{of threat}} and risk {{analysis}} for system development and maintenance. They are an extension of attack trees with defense measures. Moreover, tree nodes can be decorated with attributes, such as probability, impact and penalty, to increase the expressiveness of the model. Attribute values are typically assigned based on cognitive estimations and historically recorded events. This paper presents a practical case study with attack–defense trees. First, we create an attack–defense tree for an RFID-based goods management system for a warehouse. Then, we explore how to use a rich set of attributes for attack and defense nodes and how to assign and aggregate values to obtain condensed information, such as performance indicators or other key security figures. We discuss different modeling choices and trade-offs. The case study led us to define concrete guidelines that can be used by software <b>developers,</b> <b>security</b> analysts and system owners when performing similar assessments. ...|$|R
