5|$|<b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't see gay {{and lesbian}} history {{starting}} with Stonewall... and I don't see resistance starting with Stonewall. What I do see is a historical coming together of forces, and the sixties changed how human beings endured things in this society and what they refused to endure... Certainly something special happened on that night in 1969, and we've made it more special in our need to have what I call a point of origin... it's more complex than saying that {{it all started with}} Stonewall.|$|E
5|$|I {{liked them}} both {{because they were}} ironic and provocative {{at the same time}} but also unlike me. I am not a materialistic person, and <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn't a virgin, and, by the way, how can you be like a virgin? I liked the play on words; I thought they were clever. They're so geeky, they're cool. I never {{realized}} they would become my signature songs, especially the second one.|$|E
5|$|If {{you read}} {{the records of the}} Royal Society and what they were doing in the 1660s, it's clear that at a certain point, some of these people– and I think Hooke was one of them– became a little bit disgusted with {{themselves}} and began excusing themselves when one of these vivisections was going to happen. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't think they turned into hardcore animal rights campaigners, or anything close to that, but I think after a while, they got a little bit sick of it and started to feel conflicted about what they were doing. So I've tried to show that ambivalence and complication in the book.|$|E
6000|$|... 'O yes, <b>I</b> will, <b>certainly.</b> <b>I</b> {{am afraid}} I showed too much feeling, {{the reverse of}} stoical, when the {{accident}} occurred. That was not very noble of me.' ...|$|R
50|$|CHAMBERS. <b>I</b> most <b>certainly</b> did.|$|R
25|$|L: Well, Mr. President, {{that is your}} decision, <b>certainly.</b> <b>I</b> cannot {{advise you}} {{one way or the}} other. But as I've said, if I can ever be of any {{assistance}} in looking after your security, <b>I</b> would <b>certainly</b> do so.|$|R
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> {{believe that}} people who are in pain should be helped and {{assisted}} in every way possible, that the drugs should be used to mitigate their pain but I believe the law of the United States of America which requires that drugs not be used except for legitimate health purposes.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't {{feel like}} a winner. That's how I'd feel {{if there were a}} few shocked Brusselian bureaucrats walking around the piece, shaking their heads, {{thinking}} about what those Czechs have done here. We expected this to be treated as a joke, a happening, a nice installation, nothing else. That we are already discussing the removal of some parts doesn't seem like a tremendous success to me. I'd be much happier if it remained whole.|$|E
25|$|But for me {{that saying}} of Pittacus doesn’t ring true either (even {{if he was a}} smart man): he says “being good is hard.” For me, a man's good enough as long as he's not lawless, and if he has the common {{sense of right and wrong}} that does a city good—a decent guy. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> won’t find fault with a man like that. After all, there’s an endless supply of stupid fools. The way I see it, if there’s no great shame in it, it's all right.|$|E
60|$|BERTLEY. Before I say that, Ann, <b>I</b> must <b>certainly</b> see the individual.|$|R
60|$|RANKIN. <b>I</b> will <b>certainly</b> not propose {{anything}} so dangerous as an excursion.|$|R
60|$|LADY CAROLINE (briefly). As you ask me, <b>I</b> should <b>certainly</b> say jail.|$|R
25|$|If {{we accept}} {{the fact that they were}} above the Second Step, they would have seemed to be {{incredibly}} close to the summit of Everest and I think at that stage something takes hold of most climbers... And I think therefore taking all those circumstances in view... I think it is quite conceivable that they did go for the summit... <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> would love to think that they actually reached the summit of Everest. I think it is a lovely thought and I think it is something, you know, gut emotion, yes I would love them to have got there. Whether they did or not, I think that is something one just cannot know.|$|E
25|$|I {{think every}} {{director}} {{thinks that he}} hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
25|$|It will {{hardly be}} disputed, I suppose, that the {{department}} of literature in which the Eastern writers stand highest is poetry. And <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> never met with any orientalist who ventured to maintain that the Arabic and Sanscrit poetry could be compared to that of the great European nations. But when we pass from works of imagination to works in which facts are recorded and general principles investigated, the superiority of the Europeans becomes absolutely immeasurable. It is, I believe, no exaggeration to say that all the historical information which has been collected from all the books written in the Sanscrit language is less valuable than what may be found in the most paltry abridgments used at preparatory schools in England. In every branch of physical or moral philosophy, the relative position of the two nations is nearly the same.|$|E
60|$|PURDIE (looking like {{a note of}} interrogation). <b>I</b> should <b>certainly</b> like to say it.|$|R
60|$|BENNET. I {{think your}} ladyship {{must have been}} misinformed. <b>I</b> most <b>certainly</b> have seen none.|$|R
60|$|Isaac. Then {{you are a}} forward, impertinent simpleton! and <b>I</b> shall <b>certainly</b> acquaint your father.|$|R
25|$|White {{decided not}} to accept any more prizes for his work, and he {{declined}} both the $10,000 Britannia Award and another Miles Franklin Award. White was approached by Harry M. Miller {{to work on a}} screenplay for Voss but nothing came of it. He became an active opponent of literary censorship and joined a number of other public figures in signing a statement of defiance against Australia’s decision to participate in the Vietnam War. His name had sometimes been mentioned as a contender for the Nobel Prize in Literature, but in 1971, after losing to Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, he wrote to a friend: That Nobel Prize! I hope I never hear it mentioned again. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> don't want it; the machinery behind it seems a bit dirty, when we thought that only applied to Australian awards. In my case to win the prize would upset my life far too much, and it would embarrass me to be held up to the world as an Australian writer when, apart from the accident of blood, I feel I am temperamentally a cosmopolitan Londoner.|$|E
25|$|Well, it's {{not really}} a choice at all. It's just, you know, I started playing very young and from early on, the people I was {{listening}} to had some element of finger style. Probably the first guitarist I was emulating was Scotty Moore, when I was maybe 6 or 7. And he played with a pick, but he also used fingers. And {{a lot of the}} session players, like Chet Atkins, they played with fingers or a pick. Then I listened to a certain amount of light classical guitar playing. And of course later on, when the first wave of rock 'n' roll kind of fell away, folk music was very popular and very influential in my style. So it was really less of a choice than what I fell into. I use a pick occasionally. <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> use it more in the studio when {{you want to get a}} certain tone. But it's just the way I came up. I wasn't taught. I just sort of figured things out on my own terms. I guess that was one of the ways that I became comfortable and it just kind of set in.|$|E
500|$|SEN. CLINTON: I {{just want}} to add, I {{did not say that}} it should be done, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> {{recognize}} why Governor Spitzer is trying to do it. And we have failed -- ...|$|E
60|$|I {{promised that}} <b>I</b> would <b>certainly</b> {{let her know}} in case I had such a desire.|$|R
60|$|LADY MARY. <b>I</b> shall <b>certainly</b> see her. Bring her to me. (He goes.) You two needn't wait.|$|R
5000|$|BANGLE SELLER: Now I {{know about}} your home, [...] I got the directions, <b>I</b> will <b>certainly</b> visit it.|$|R
500|$|Braun, for his part, noted {{after the}} 2007 season: [...] "It's only my second full (professional) year of playing third base. I don't {{expect to be}} perfect, but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> expect {{to be better than}} I have been. I have to {{continue}} to work hard, and hopefully I'll improve." ...|$|E
500|$|Cambridge {{number four}} Henry Cubasch remarked [...] "They had the strength, {{character}} {{and went for}} it; we just let them slip." [...] Oxford's Constantine Louloudis said [...] "We held Cambridge in high regard. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't predict a margin like that." [...] Cambridge president Rasumussen called it a [...] "stinging defeat".|$|E
500|$|International Master Anthony Saidy {{recalled}} his last round {{encounter with the}} undefeated Fischer:Going into the final game <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> {{did not expect to}} upset Fischer. I hardly knew the opening but played simply, and he went along with the scenario, opting for a N-v-B [...] endgame with a minimal edge. In the corridor, Evans said to me, 'Good. Show him we're not all children.' ...|$|E
60|$|RAMSDEN. You can {{refuse to}} accept the guardianship. <b>I</b> shall <b>certainly</b> refuse to hold it jointly with you.|$|R
60|$|He chuckled again, that silent {{interior}} laugh, and <b>I</b> was <b>certainly</b> grinning {{in sympathy}} {{as he went}} on.|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. My dear, I {{hope there}} is nothing of the kind. <b>I</b> will <b>certainly</b> speak to the gardener.|$|R
500|$|Despite the film's darkness, Nolan {{wanted to}} make the film appeal to a wide age range. [...] "Not the {{youngest}} kids obviously, I think what we've done is probably a bit intense for them but <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> didn't want to exclude the sort of ten to 12-year olds, because as a kid I {{would have loved to have}} seen a movie like this." [...] Because of this, nothing gory or bloody was filmed.|$|E
500|$|Keating and John Granger was {{hit with}} a $1.1 billion fraud and {{racketeering}} action, filed against them by the regulators. In talking to reporters in April, Keating said, [...] "One question, among many raised in recent weeks, had to do with whether my financial support in any way influenced several political figures to take up my cause. I want to say in the most forceful way I can: <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> hope so." ...|$|E
500|$|To all the praise, Youngblood responded, [...] "I don't {{consider}} myself tough, I {{consider myself}} a nut {{for some of the}} things I did". Youngblood concluded, [...] "I wasn’t the biggest guy, <b>I</b> <b>certainly</b> wasn’t the strongest and I wasn’t the fastest either. [...] But I think one of my biggest assets was that I had an undeniable determination to be the best that has ever {{put his hand on the}} ground, I had a genuine desire to be great." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Certainly, <b>I</b> did not. <b>Certainly</b> <b>I</b> never shall {{yield to}} him. Dear Janet, pray {{take that as}} a certainty. Let me make you sure at any rate of that. He must be sure of it himself." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>certainly</b> {{succeeded in}} making an {{impression}} this time. Mr. Parker's smooth forehead was wrinkled; his face was clouded.|$|R
60|$|RANKIN (cannily). I {{take your}} point, Leddy Ceecily. It alters the case. <b>I</b> shall <b>certainly</b> make no allusion to it.|$|R
