2500|$|In a {{discussion}} on academic kindergartens, professor of child development David Elkind has argued that, since [...] "there is no solid research demonstrating that early academic training is superior to (or worse than) the more traditional, hands-on model of early education", <b>educators</b> <b>should</b> defer to developmental approaches that provide young children with ample time and opportunity to explore the natural world on their own terms. Elkind emphasized the principle that [...] "early education must start with the child, not with the subject matter to be taught." ...|$|E
2500|$|Expressed {{needs are}} {{difficult}} to assess and address in the classroom environment, as they are needs directly expressed by learners through behaviour or words. Although expressed needs {{are difficult to}} address, educators need to treat them positively {{in order to maintain}} a caring relationship with learners. [...] If expressed needs are not treated carefully, the individual might not feel cared for. <b>Educators</b> <b>should</b> make a consistent effort to respond to a student’s expressed needs through prior planning and discussions of moral and social issues surrounding the needs ...|$|E

The commission's report recommended four criteria that OWU's <b>educators</b> <b>should</b> foster: perception, critical judgement, enjoyment, and active responsibility for the problems of society. On [...] "active responsibility for the problems of society", the report stated, [...] "A socially concerned individual who had no capacity for enjoyment, who exercised glib and trite rather than critical judgement, and who had no perception of reality, would be a public menace.

2500|$|Similar criticisms include {{accusations that}} Gordon's skills-based {{programs}} of applying Music Learning Theory are [...] "probably too narrow and limited in scope {{to provide students}} access to diversity of musical belief systems, practices, and groups that exists", a concern of writer Paul G. Woodford and music education theorist Bennett Reimer. Woodford credits Gordon for his highly developed system {{about the nature of}} music teaching and learning, but cautions that Gordon's system is too prescriptive and proscriptive to students and teachers, and that music <b>educators</b> <b>should</b> also be aware of the diversity of practices and strive to not exert pressure on students to conform to conventional musical thought and behavior. Gordon's 1997 response responds to this indirectly, arguing that his methodology leaves room for other methodologies to be taught alongside it.|$|E
2500|$|For many {{indigenous}} students (such as Native American children), motivation may {{be derived}} from social organization; an important factor <b>educators</b> <b>should</b> account for in addition to variations in sociolinguistics and cognition. While poor academic performance among Native American students is often attributed to low levels of motivation, Top-down classroom organization is often found to be ineffective for children of many cultures who depend on a sense of community, purpose, and competence in order to engage. Horizontally structured, community-based learning strategies often provide a more structurally supportive environment for motivating indigenous children, {{who tend to be}} driven by [...] "social/affective emphasis, harmony, holistic perspectives, expressive creativity, and nonverbal communication." [...] This drive is also traceable to a cultural tradition of community-wide expectations of participation in the activities and goals of the greater group, rather than individualized aspirations of success or triumph.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{opponents of}} LGBT social {{movements}} have attributed their indifference toward homosexuality {{as being a}} result of the immoral values that it may instill in children who are exposed to homosexual individuals. In opposition to this claim, many proponents of increased education about homosexuality suggest that <b>educators</b> <b>should</b> refrain from teaching about sexuality in schools entirely. In her book entitled [...] "Gay and Lesbian Movement," [...] Margaret Cruickshank provides statistical data from the Harris and Yankelovich polls which confirmed that over 80% of American adults believe that students should be educated about sexuality within their public school. In addition, the poll also found that 75% of parents believe that homosexuality and abortion {{should be included in the}} curriculum as well. An assessment conducted on California public school systems discovered that only 2% of all parents actually disapproved of their child being taught about sexuality in school.|$|E

2500|$|To help {{illustrate}} the care {{that must be}} taken in teaching children and to emphasise the necessity of properly directing and managing their attentiveness, Maria Edgeworth drew several comparisons with non-European peoples. In her 1798 book Practical Education she maintained that unnecessarily causing fatigue should be a great concern of educators. In making the point that any mode of instruction that tired the attention was hurtful to children, her reasoning was that people can pay attention only to {{one thing at a}} time, and because children can appear resistant to repetition, teachers naturally should vary things. However, <b>educators</b> <b>should</b> always be mindful of the fact that, [...] "while variety relieves the mind, the objects which are varied must not all be entirely new, for novelty and variety when joined, fatigue the mind" [...] as Edgeworth states. The teaching of children needed to follow carefully considered methods, needed to evidence concern for appropriateness and proper sequencing, and needed to be guided by consideration from forms of teaching that would be empowering and enabling, not fatiguing or disabling. In Edgeworth's work, the attention of the child appears as a key site for pedagogical work and interventions.|$|E

This study utilized a series of in-depth interviews, while the participants (n ¼ 12) were enrolled in a 9 -month teacher education program at an urban university in Canada. Our data analysis revealed that beliefs about teaching physics and chemistry using SSI derive from a complex web of fundamental beliefs exemplified by four archetypes representing the subject-specific identities of our teacher candidates—Model Scientist/Engineer, Model Individual, Model Teacher, and Model Citizen. Furthermore, we found that the justification for belief change required by a particular teacher candidate depends on these subject discipline identities. Thus, the presence of each archetype in preservice classrooms has ramifications for the way a teacher <b>educator</b> <b>should</b> encourage his or her students to include SSI in their teaching...|$|R

Several examples are given of each, and suggestions are made for identifying what should be stable and what should be changed. Caution is recommended in adopting new ideas, but it is emphasized that educators must remain ready to accept changes that bring real benefits.
