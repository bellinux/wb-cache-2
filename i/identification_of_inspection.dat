40|$|The quality <b>of</b> <b>inspection</b> {{techniques}} {{is generally}} {{expressed in terms}} of Probability of Detection (PoD) curves and sometimes in addition by the Probability of False Indication (PFI). Such a format facilitates a quantitative description <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> quality and allows for risk based inspection planning (RBI). Existing PoD curves describe the inspection quality implicitly assuming that the entire area or volume subject to possible defects is inspected. Such an assumption stands in gross contrast to most practical applications where full inspection coverage is hardly possible nor relevant and consequently only a percentage of the considered area is inspected. In the present paper an extension of the classical PoD / PFI concept to systems with only partial inspection is introduced based on theoretical considerations. The proposed approach takes into account the aspects of the interrelation of the spatial variability of the deterioration processes and the coverage <b>of</b> the performed <b>inspections.</b> It is illustrated on an example highlighting how this may be applied for the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the optimal <b>inspection</b> coverage in risk based inspection and maintenance planning...|$|R
40|$|In {{its current}} state, the wide {{acceptance}} of the Magneto-Optical Imaging (MOI) technique is hindered due to noise, lack of recordable results, and impossibility of data post-processing. This paper presents some add-ons made to a commercial MOI system to ease the image interpretation, archiving and reporting of the results. In addition, a few image processing techniques are also employed {{in an attempt to}} perform automatic flaw detection. The recording capability of the MOI instrument output images was addressed by digitizing the video signal in video or image files. To help with the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the damage location and distance between images, a rotary quadrature encoder was mounted onto the MOI scan head. The use of the encoder allowed the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> the <b>inspection</b> location with respect to a reference position, such as the beginning of the scan. Moreover, it allowed saving images at fixed intervals, which were then stitched into a single image, thus simplifying the post inspection analysis process. Both live and post-inspection image processing capabilities were made available. Implemented image processing included background subtraction, de-noising, contrast adjustment and morphological operation, among others. Contrast stretching transform and background subtractions were found to be among the most powerful techniques {{that could be used in}} simplifying the image interpretation.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} generic, mirror-based {{debugging}} architecture that supports runtime visibility and traceability of aspect oriented (AO) software systems. Runtime visibility supports <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> an executing AO-system in terms of AO programming abstractions and code artifacts such as (dynamic) aspects, advices, pointcuts, aspect instances and advice applications. Runtime traceability supports <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the stack to identify advices {{that could have been}} executed, that are being executed, or that may be executed later. Additionally, traceability supports <b>identification</b> and <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> the pointcut that causes a specific advice. We have created a mirror based architecture that offers introspection support including an aspect-aware breakpoint model for AOP-related runtime events. We introduce the concept of hook frames to trace joinpoints and their advices on the stack. We validate the genericity of our architecture in two instantiations - JBoss AOP and AspectJ/ABC - and evaluate both instantiations by applying concrete debugging scenarios. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|In the {{production}} of each Space Shuttle Reusable Solid Rocket Motor (RSRM), over 100, 000 inspections are performed. ATK Thiokol Inc. reviewed these inspections to ensure a robust inspection system is maintained. The principal effort within this endeavor was the systematic <b>identification</b> and evaluation <b>of</b> <b>inspections</b> considered to be single-point. Single-point inspections are those accomplished on components, materials, and tooling by only one person, involving no other check. The purpose was to more accurately characterize risk and ultimately address and/or mitigate risk associated with single-point inspections. After the initial review <b>of</b> all <b>inspections</b> and identification/assessment <b>of</b> single-point <b>inspections,</b> review teams applied risk prioritization methodology {{similar to that used}} in a Process Failure Modes Effects Analysis to derive a Risk Prioritization Number for each single-point inspection. After the prioritization of risk, all single-point inspection points determined to have significant risk were provided either with risk-mitigating actions or rationale for acceptance. This effort gave confidence to the RSRM program that the correct inspections are being accomplished, that there is appropriate justification for those that remain as single-point inspections, and that risk mitigation was applied to further reduce risk of higher risk single-point inspections. This paper examines the process, results, and lessons learned in identifying, assessing, and mitigating risk associated with single-point inspections accomplished in {{the production}} of the Space Shuttle RSRM...|$|R
