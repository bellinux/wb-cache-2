Methods: The study included 50 patients with rheumatic mitral valve disease undergoing mitral valve replacement. Preoperative assessment included standard two-dimensional echocardiography to assess LA diameter, volume, and emptying fraction, LV volume and ejection fraction. TDI derived velocity, strain of the left atrium and speckle tracking to assess left ventricular function then postoperative follow up for 1  month for occurrence of atrial fibrillation. Results: The incidence of postoperative AF was 44 %; these patients were significantly older (P =  0. 001) and show higher prevalence of DM (P =  0. 001) and HTN (P =  0. 001). Also, LA diameters (antero-posterior, transverse and longitudinal) and LA volumes (maximal and minimal) were increased (P    0. 05).

Patients were examined prior to and 7 days after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) using speckle-tracking techniques. Fifty-nine patients (36 males and 23 females) and 60 healthy controls (40 males and 20 females) were enrolled in this study.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the best means of early detection of subsequent reduction of EF in patients with breast cancer treated with trastuzumab. Methods: Eighty-one consecutive women (mean age, 50 ± 11 years) receiving trastuzumab were prospectively studied, 37 of whom received concurrent anthracyclines. Conventional echocardiographic indices (mitral annular systolic [s′] and diastolic [e′] velocities) and myocardial deformation indices (<b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> peak systolic <b>strain</b> [GLS], <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> peak systolic <b>strain</b> rate [GLSR-S], and <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> early diastolic <b>strain</b> rate [GLSR-E]) were measured at baseline and at 6 and 12 months.

40|$|Objective Systemic {{sclerosis}} (SSc) is a {{connective tissue}} disease characterized by vascular inflammation and fibrosis. Visceral involvement, including cardiac manifestations, {{can lead to}} severe clinical complications, such as congestive heart failure, arrhythmias, and sudden death. Conventional echocardiography parameters have limited sensitivity to detect subtle myocardial dysfunction in patients with SSc. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess, using novel speckle-tracking strain analysis, the presence of myocardial dysfunction in patients with SSc, and to investigate its relationship to functional capacity and ventricular arrhythmias. Methods A total of 104 patients with SSc (mean ± SD age 54 ± 12 years, 77 % female) were included and underwent cardiopulmonary exercise testing, 24 -hour electrocardiography (EKG) Holter monitoring, and transthoracic echocardiography. For comparison, 37 matched healthy control subjects were included. Results The total patient population consisted of 51 patients with limited cutaneous SSc and 53 with diffuse cutaneous SSc. Peak VO 2 was a mean ± SD 91 ± 20 % predicted, and 28 patients had abnormal findings (ventricular tachycardia or ventricular ectopics > 100 /day) on EKG Holter monitoring. Patients with SSc, as compared with controls, had impaired <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> and circumferential <b>strains</b> (mean ± SD - 18. 2 ± 1. 8 % versus - 21. 3 ± 1. 7 % and - 18. 2 ± 2. 3 % versus - 21. 3 ± 2. 1 %, respectively; each P < 0. 01), but there was no difference in the left ventricular ejection fraction between patients and controls (mean ± SD 63. 5 ± 7. 2 % versus 64. 6 ± 4. 4 %; P = 0. 20). In patients with SSc, <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> and circumferential <b>strains</b> each correlated with the peak VO 2 (r = - 0. 46 and r = - 0. 41, respectively; both P < 0. 01), and multivariate analysis confirmed the independent association of each strain measure with the peak VO 2. Compared to SSc patients with normal results on EKG Holter monitoring, SSc patients with abnormal results showed impaired <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strains</b> (- 18. 5 ± 1. 5 % versus - 17. 1 ± 2. 1 %; P < 0. 01) and circumferential strains (- 18. 7 ± 2. 0 % versus - 17. 3 ± 2. 5 %; P = 0. 01), and each strain measure was independently associated with abnormal Holter findings.

AimsTo assess left ventricular (LV) and RV remodelling in patients with Eisenmenger syndrome compared to a control population, using speckle-tracking imaging. MethodsAdults with Eisenmenger syndrome and healthy controls were enrolled into this prospective two-centre study. Patients with Eisenmenger syndrome with low acoustic windows, irregular heart rhythm or complex congenital heart disease were excluded. Clinical assessment, B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP), 6 -minute walk test and echocardiography (including dedicated views to perform offline two-dimensional-speckle-tracking analysis) were performed on inclusion. ResultsOur patient population (n= 37; mean age 42. 3 ± 17 years) was mostly composed of patients with ventricular septal defect (37. 8 %) or atrial septal defect (35. 1 %).

This study was conducted to determine the impact of revascularization in chronic total occlusion on left ventricular function using novel echocardiographic techniques. METHODS: A total of 129 patients with chronic total occlusion who underwent revascularization between April 2011 and November 2012 were included in this study. Echocardiographic assessments with two-dimensional speckle tracking echocardiography and real-time three-dimensional echocardiography were performed before the procedure and one month after the procedure. The left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular volumes, and three-dimensional systolic dyssynchrony index were quantified. RESULTS: An immediate procedural success was obtained in 118 patients (91. 5 %). There were no acute or subacute stent thromboses during follow-up. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction significantly increased (p< 0. 001), while the left ventricular end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes significantly decreased (p = 0. 001 and p< 0. 001, respectively). The three-dimensional systolic dyssynchrony index also decreased significantly (p< 0. 001). The <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> showed a significant increase after successful revascularization (p< 0. 001).

AIMS: We sought to determine the impact of {{aortic stenosis}} (AS) on left ventricular (LV) longitudinal function at exercise {{in a series of}} asymptomatic patients with AS and preserved LV ejection fraction. METHODS AND RESULTS: Long-axis function was assessed at rest and at exercise by using 2 D speckle tracking of myocardial deformation in 207 AS patients (aortic valve area 0. 87 ± 0. 19 cm²) and 43 aged-matched control subjects. When compared with control subjects, patients with AS have reduced longitudinal myocardial function at rest (- 20. 2 ± 2. 7 vs. - 15. 4 ± 4. 0 %) and at peak exercise (- 25. 0 ± 3. 7 vs. - 16. 5 ± 4. 9 %) (P < 0. 0001 for both). Exercise changes in <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> were correlated with changes in LV ejection in controls but not in patients with AS. Changes in LV <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> during test were lower in AS patients with an abnormal response to exercise (- 0. 5 ± 2. 7 vs. - 1. 5 ± 2. 8 %, P = 0. 001).

Methods　Detailed prenatal echocardiographic examinations were performed in 53 normal fetuses. Digital dynamic four-chamber views were collected and analyzed offline. In the four-chamber view, the interventricular septum and left ventricular lateral wall were divided into basal, middle and apical segments, in a total of six segments. Endocardial tracing began {{at the edge of the}} anterior mitral valve annulus, along endocardium of interventricular septum, extended to the ventricular apex, and returned to posterior mitral valve annulus along lateral ventricular wall edge. The <b>global</b> and segmental <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain,</b> strain rate and peak velocity of the interventricular septum and left ventricular lateral wall were measured, the global function was calculated by an average of all segments. Segmental measurements were compared to global results. Results　Fifty-three fetuses were enrolled in this study, and the VVI analysis was successful in 49, the success rate was 92. 4 %. The global left ventricular strain was – 13. 72 %± 3. 99 %, and the strain rate was – 2. 59 ± 0. 44 /s and 2. 43 ± 0. 38 /s in systole and diastole respectively. No difference was found between segmental and global ventricular strain and strain rate. The left global ventricular peak velocity was 1. 68 ± 0. 46 cm/s and 1. 51 ± 0. 41 cm/s in systole and diastole respectively. The peak segmental velocity in systole and diastole decreased from the base of interventricular septum and lateral wall to ventricular apex. The global left ventricular peak velocity was significantly different from the peak velocity of apical and basal segments (P< 0. 05). Conclusions　Measurement of <b>global</b> left ventricular <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain,</b> strain rate and peak velocity is feasible in fetuses by using VVI. Global left ventricular function may be a new index for assessment of quantitative fetal cardiac function...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Cardiovascular risk {{prediction}} is deemed fundamental and {{the assessment of}} organ damage is emerging as a potentially 'downstream' picture of individual risk. Our aim {{was to assess the}} feasibility and value of prediction of coronaropathy [coronary artery disease (CAD) ] of integrated cardiovascular ultrasound examination. METHODS: This multicenter study involved eight cardiology centers that enrolled 457 consecutive patients. Blood pressures, carotid intima-media thickness (cIMT), carotid pulse wave velocity (cPWV), semiquantitative score of cardiac calcifications, <b>global</b> myocardial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> (GLS), and rest Doppler flow velocity on the left anterior descending (LAD) coronary artery were measured.

40|$|We {{investigated}} intermodality agreements of strains from {{two-dimensional echocardiography}} (2 DE) and cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) feature tracking (FT) {{in the assessment}} of right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) mechanics in tetralogy of Fallot (TOF). Patients were prospectively studied with 2 DE and CMR performed contiguously. LV and RV strains were computed separately using 2 DE and CMR-FT. Segmental and <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strains</b> (GLS) for the LV and RV were measured from four-chamber views; LV radial (global radial strain [GRS]) and circumferential strains (GCS) measured from short-axis views. Intermodality and interobserver agreements were examined. In 40 patients (20 TOF, mean age 23 years and 20 adult controls), LV, GCS showed narrowest intermodality limits of agreement (mean percentage error 9. 5 %), followed by GLS (16. 4 %). RV GLS had mean intermodality difference of 25. 7 %. GLS and GCS had acceptable interobserver agreement for the LV and RV with both 2 DE and CMR-FT, whereas GRS had high interobserver and intermodality variability. In conclusion, myocardial strains for the RV and LV derived using currently available 2 DE and CMR-FT software are subject to con-siderable intermodality variability. For both modalities, LV GCS, LV GLS, and RV GLS are reproducible enough to warrant further investigation of incremental clinical merit.

40|$|Echocardiography is {{the most}} {{frequently}} used imaging modality to determine cardiac function. Left ventricular ejection fraction the most widely used parameter for evaluation of systolic function, provides important prognostic value in clinical practice, and forms part of the evidence base for many decisions about cardiovascular care. However, ejection fraction has several substantial limitations and is insensitive to subtle changes in systolic function. The assessment of myocardial deformation with echocardiography has been studied for two decades, and is increasingly used in the clinical setting. This technique can precisely characterize the mechanics of myocardial contraction and relaxation. The most commonly used parameter is <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain,</b> which is more sensitive than ejection fraction for the measurement of systolic function. This review focuses on the prognostic value of <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> in predicting adverse outcomes in cardiovascular disease...|$|E

30|$|Introduction Septic {{cardiomyopathy}} {{is commonly}} encountered {{in patients with}} septic shock. Most studies suggest no correlation between left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) and mortality in patients with septic shock.

40|$|Disruption of the {{myocardial}} {{architecture in}} left ventricular noncompaction (LVNC) may alter myocardial deformation. We evaluated LV myocardial deformation and tested {{the hypothesis that}} tight systolic-diastolic coupling occurs in LVNC. <b>Longitudinal</b> and circumferential <b>strain</b> and strain rates (SRs) as determined by speckle tracking echocardiography in nine children aged 5. 6 ± 5. 5 years was compared with those in nine controls. Left ventricular systolic myocardial deformation parameters were correlated with ejection fraction and indices of diastolic deformation. Compared with controls, patients had lower <b>global</b> LV systolic <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> (P = 0. 008), systolic SR (P = 0. 05) and early diastolic SR (P < 0. 001). Similarly, LV systolic circumferential strain (base, P = 0. 04; papillary muscle level, P = 0. 01; apex, P = 0. 04), systolic SR (base, P = 0. 04) and early diastolic SR (papillary muscle level, P = 0. 004, apex, P = 0. 02) were lower in patients than in controls. Among patients, the LV ejection fraction correlated with <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> systolic <b>strain</b> and SR and circumferential systolic strain and SR at all levels (all P < 0. 05). Positive correlations existed between early diastolic and systolic SRs in corresponding dimensions (longitudinal r = 0. 80, P = 0. 01; circumferential at base, r = 0. 91, P = 0. 001; papillary muscle level, r = 0. 96, P < 0. 001; apex r = 0. 98, P = < 0. 001). In conclusion, LV myocardial deformation is reduced in the longitudinal and circumferential dimensions and manifests tight systolic-diastolic coupling in children with LVNC. © 2010 Springer. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Modern echocardiographic techniques, i. e. tissue Doppler {{imaging and}} speckle {{tracking}} echocardiography, allow for {{an assessment of}} global and regional right ventricular function. The right ventricular myocardial performance index and tricuspid annulus motion {{are used in the}} assessment of global right ventricular function, whereas duration of the cardiac cycle phases and myocardial velocities are used in the assessment of regional function. Strain and strain rate allow for an evaluation of both regional and global myocardial function. Literature reports provide data on the usefulness of these methods in patients with pressure and volume overload as well as with direct myocardial damage involving the right ventricle. In pulmonary hypertension, S’ wave assessment may be used for therapeutic efficacy evaluation. <b>Longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> reduction indicates an increased risk of vascular events, while an increased value of myocardial performance index is a predictor for a survival in pulmonary hypertension. A decreased S’ wave velocity is associated with limited pulmonary vascular flow in patients with pulmonary embolism. In patients after atrial baffle repair for transposition of the great arteries, decreased <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> was an independent predictor for heart failure. A statistically significant decrease in both the S’ wave as well as acceleration during isovolumic contraction were observed in arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy. S’ wave and <b>global</b> right ventricular <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> values were lower in patients in the acute phase of myocardial infarction involving the right ventricle compared to the corresponding parameters in healthy individuals. In the case of tetralogy of Fallot correction, the evaluation of S’ wave velocity may prove useful in identifying patients with reduced cardiac systolic reserve; a good correlation was also found between the <b>global</b> right ventricular <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> and right ventricular ejection fraction in MRI...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{evaluate}} the left ventricular (LV) and left atrial (LA) function in patients with gout. A total of 173 patients underwent a comprehensive Doppler-echocardiography examination. Participants were divided into four groups-Stage 0 : control (n = 35), Stage I: asymptomatic hyperuricemia (n = 30), Stage II: gouty arthritis without tophi (n = 58), and Stage III: tophaceous gout (n = 50). Serum uric acid levels {{were not significantly different}} between stage I, II and III. Stage III patients demonstrated a higher ratio of the transmitral and myocardial peak early diastolic velocities (E/Em) (10. 50 ± 3. 18 vs. 8. 58 ± 2. 07; P = 0. 008), and larger maximal LA volume index (LAVi) (29. 60 ± 9. 89 vs. 20. 07 ± 4. 76 ml/m(2); P< 0. 001) compared with controls. Stage III patients had decreased LV <b>global</b> <b>longitudinal</b> systolic <b>strain</b> (LVε) compared with controls (- 20. 2 ± 3. 06 vs. - 21. 79 ± 2. 27; P = 0. 002). Stage III patients also had decreased peak atrial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> rate during ventricular systole (ALSR(syst)), peak atrial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> rate during ventricular early diastole (ALSR(early)), and peak atrial <b>longitudinal</b> <b>strain</b> rate during ventricular late diastole (ALSR(late)) compared with controls (1. 73 ± 0. 48 vs. 2. 05 ± 0. 55 1 /s, - 1. 44 ± 0. 53 vs. - 2. 07 ± 0. 84 1 /s, - 2. 07 ± 0. 7 vs. - 2. 66 ± 0. 91 1 /s, respectively; all P< 0. 005). Multiple regression analysis revealed severity of gout had an independent negative impact on LA pump function (ALSR(late)).
