25|$|Walker reentered Virginia, in Loudoun County on September 9, {{across from}} Point of Rocks. Walker was escorted by Col. E.V. White, Loudoun native, and his 35th Battalion of Virginia Cavalry. White {{was unhappy with}} the {{assignment}} and preferred {{to be with the}} rest of the army. Unfortunately White <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> an altercation with Maj. Gen. J.E.B. Stuart in Frederick and was subsequently ordered back to Virginia by Lee. Whether or not his disposition was to blame, White led Walker on a meandering route around the Short Hill Mountain to reach the base of Loudoun Heights four days later on September 13. So the attack on Harpers Ferry that had been planned for September 11 was delayed, increasing the risk that McClellan might engage and destroy a portion of Lee's army while it was divided.|$|E

After competing in a match, Show was run over by Del Rio's car, driven by Rodriguez, leaving him sidelined with a storyline knee injury.

On June 19 at Capitol Punishment, Del Rio defeated Show via referee stoppage, when he was unable to continue the match {{as a result of a}} pre-match assault by Mark Henry.

Like the {{majority}} of the album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] was composed there. West attempted to shy away from working with artists he didn't consider himself familiar with, however made the exception for Justin Vernon, singer of the band Bon Iver. Vernon's involvement in the project stemmed from a phone call by West. West <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> contact with Vernon and described his intention of sampling the song [...] "Woods" [...] from Bon Iver's Blood Bank EP. After the phone message, West invited Vernon down to his record studio in Hawaii to appear on the album.|$|E

500|$|When {{finishing}} The Playboy, Brown felt {{guilt over}} {{still looking at}} Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame. [...] While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography, to Brown {{it is about the}} guilt he was made to feel for using the media. [...] Some interpretations, such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp, see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates. [...] Brown has objected to this interpretation—rather, he sees it as a flaw in the work, in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate: that he <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive, and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women.|$|E
500|$|On July 2, Hancock's II Corps was {{positioned}} on Cemetery Ridge, roughly {{in the center}} of the Union line, while Confederate General Robert E. Lee launched assaults on both ends of the line. On the Union left, Lt. Gen. James Longstreet's assault smashed the III Corps and Hancock sent in his 1st Division, under Brig. Gen. John C. Caldwell, to reinforce the Union in the Wheatfield. As Lt. Gen. A.P. Hill's corps continued the attack toward the Union center, Hancock rallied the defenses and rushed units to the critical spots. First, he issued the Third Brigade of his Third Division under Colonel George Willard into the fray to stop the advance of Confederate Brigadier General William Barksdale's Brigade. In one famous incident, he sacrificed a regiment, the 1st Minnesota Volunteer Infantry Regiment, by ordering it to advance and charge a Confederate brigade four times its size, causing the Minnesotans to suffer 87% casualties. While costly to the regiment, this heroic sacrifice bought time to organize the defensive line and saved the day for the Union army. Following the action toward his right, he met the 13th Vermont Volunteer Infantry Regiment, [...] a First Corps unit which had come from Cemetery Hill to help quell the crisis. Hancock sent them out to recover some artillery pieces Confederates had taken and were pulling away. The Vermonters were successful. Having stabilized his line, he turned his attention to the sound of fighting on East Cemetery Hill. There, with darkness falling, Confederates from Major General Jubal Early's Division <b>had</b> <b>gotten</b> <b>into</b> Union batteries and were fighting the cannoneers hand-to-hand. Hancock sent the First Brigade of his Third Division, under Colonel Samuel S. Carroll, to the fighting. The brigade was crucial in flushing the enemy out of the batteries and dispatching them back down the face of East Cemetery Hill.|$|E
