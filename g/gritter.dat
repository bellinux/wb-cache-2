5|$|A <b>gritter,</b> {{also known}} as a sander, salt {{spreader}} or salt truck, is found on most winter service vehicles. Indeed, the <b>gritter</b> is so commonly seen on winter service vehicles that the terms are sometimes used synonymously. Gritters are used to spread grit (rock salt), onto roads. The grit is stored in the large hopper on the rear of the vehicle, with a wire mesh over the top to prevent foreign objects from entering the spreading mechanism and hence becoming jammed. The salt is generally spread across the roadway by an impeller, attached by a hydraulic drive system to a small onboard engine. However, until the 1970s, the grit was often spread manually using shovels by men riding {{on the back of the}} truck, and some older spreading mechanisms still require grit be manually loaded into the impeller from the hopper.|$|E
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing the driver to choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal <b>gritter</b> and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E

5|$|<b>Gritters</b> {{are among}} the winter service {{vehicles}} also used in airports, to keep runways free of ice.

2500|$|Alongside Underworld, {{the team}} {{decided to create}} a new {{subseries}} that featured the character of Lara Croft while not using the Tomb Raider moniker and using the aesthetics of the Legend continuity. During this period, a second development team was working on a second reboot of the series and character, which would put emphasis on a darker and <b>gritter</b> interpretation of the character. Another priority was presenting Lara as a more human character, showing her in vulnerable positions, and showing how she begins her journey to becoming a [...] "tomb raider" [...] through both narrative and gameplay. A sequel, eventually revealed as Rise of the Tomb Raider, was confirmed as being in development {{a few months after the}} reboot's release. In response to criticisms about a lack of classic tombs, more optional and story-based tombs were incorporated into the game. It also continued the team's new portrayal of Lara, showing more sides to her character and her growing obsession with discovering the truth. In addition to this, the Lara Croft subseries was continued in multiple titles: the console game Temple of Osiris, and mobile title Relic Run. In addition, the mobile puzzle game Lara Croft Go was created to both give a different gameplay experience and evoke classic Tomb Raider games.|$|E
2500|$|The album's most {{positive}} review to date came from Cameron Adams, {{writing for the}} Brisbane-based newspaper The Courier-Mail. Adams approved the band's decision {{to follow up on}} the sound of their commercially successful debut album, Conditions, marking the album as [...] "faithful" [...] in his one-word description of the album. Adams noted [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together" [...] as the album's two potential hits, describing them as [...] "better than 90-per-cent of what's in the charts and on the radio now." [...] While he felt that the album [...] "bit over-thought in parts - like they needed help to do what once came naturally to get the blasted record out", he concluded his review by stating that Thick as Thieves was [...] "undeniably strong, if lacking risks - this is everything The Temper Trap do very well indeed." [...] Also approving of the reversion to the sound of Conditions was Jules LeFevre of Australian music magazine website FasterLouder, who noted, [...] "at first glance [...] appears to be an attempt to reclaim the spotlight on the festival stages, but on closer inspection reveals a sturdy core." [...] LeFevre praised Mandagi's falsetto vocals as the album's strongest element, claiming it to be the band's [...] "edge", on top of the [...] "colossal, anthemic choruses, sky high hooks, [...] guitar lines that push and push and push and explode." [...] LeFevre continued by praising the largely guitar-driven composition of the record, in spite of Lorenzo Sillitto's exit, and commented positively on the [...] "simpler, <b>gritter,</b> more blues and classic rock driven" [...] guitars helmed by Joseph Greer. Contrasting to this, however, is LeFevre's sharp criticism of the album's lyricism, describing them as [...] "cringe-worthy", and disapproving of songs such as [...] "Lost" [...] and [...] "Fall Together", although stating that the lyrics felt [...] "comfortable" [...] in context of the music itself. Matt Collar of the American-based online music guide AllMusic noted that the departure of Sillitto and Greer's move into the role as lead guitarist had virtually no effect on the band's music. In writing a positive review for AllMusic, he also praised Mandagi's vocals as a [...] "powerful and emotive" [...] presence on the album, commenting on the [...] "scintillating" [...] combination of his vocals and the album's [...] "thick wave of electric guitars, pulsing synths, and drums", comparing the sound to the music of Cee Lo Green and The Killers. Collar additionally described Thick as Thieves as [...] "a heartfelt love letter to The Temper Trap's fans who have stuck with them since Conditions." ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWhen roads {{may become}} dangerously {{slippery}} due to frost, ice or snow, local authorities treat the roads by spreading a de-icing agent (usually salt) on them. In order {{to treat a}} road, a winter gritting vehicle must travel down the road once, spreading salt on to {{both sides of the}} carriageway. An application is described where routes were constructed for <b>gritters</b> in a local authority area. The formulation of the model is presented which involves dealing with multiple depot locations, limited vehicle capacities, and roads with different priorities (for example, some must be treated within two hours and others within four hours of the start of gritting). The objective function to be optimised depends on both the total distance travelled, and the number and capacity of the <b>gritters.</b> The solution method is a heuristic algorithm, which involves, as a first stage, the optimal solution of an unconstrained Chinese Postman Problem for the network, and followed by the use of Simulated Annealing for the constrained problem...|$|R

50|$|Snow and ice removal also {{decreases}} road slipperiness; snowploughs {{and snow}} blowers can remove the snow {{from the road}} surface while <b>gritters</b> drop road salt and sand, which both melts the snow and ice from the road surface, and provide a rougher surface to grip onto.
