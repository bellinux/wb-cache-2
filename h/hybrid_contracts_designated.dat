Nevertheless presence of insurance has provoked debate among contemporary Muslim scholars related to its validity.

40|$|There are {{two types}} of contracts. A {{different}} set of laws applies to each. The common law of contracts governs a contract for services. The Uniform Commercial Code (UCC) applies to the sale of goods. However, many construction contracts are a mix of both goods and services. This type of <b>contract</b> is a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract.</b> When a claim is in litigation, the court applies either common law or the UCC to a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract.</b> The outcome of the case depends on whether the court interprets the contract as either predominately for services or for goods. This paper will highlight the major disparate rules applicable for each type of contract. It will also explain the different tests the court system uses to determine the contract type in dispute [...] a services contract or a goods contract. Most cases involving construction contracts are service contracts and governed by common law. However, in 1974, the court applied the UCC to a <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract</b> in Bonebrake v. Cox developing the predominate thrust test and has since set precedence in many such cases. A study of court cases from the State of Georgia yields data on the <b>hybrid</b> <b>contract</b> issue with a sample of 12 cases. The qualitative survey resulted in the gravamen test and divisibility test as most used by the court system of Georgia. The character of the agreement itself must provide much defense as to the type of contract. Therefore, contractors should use several tests to advance their argument. This study will assist a contractor to develop a beneficial agreement that the legal system will support under interpretation...|$|R

40|$|We study {{jury trial}} waivers in a data set of 2, 816 {{contracts}} contained as exhibits in Form 8 -K filings by reporting corporations during 2002. Because these contracts {{are associated with}} events deemed material to the financial condition of SEC-reporting firms, they likely are carefully negotiated by sophisticated, well-informed parties and thus provide presumptive evidence about the value associated with the availability of jury trials. A minority of contracts, about 20 percent, waived jury trials. An additional 9 percent of contracts had arbitration clauses that effectively preclude jury trials though the reason for arbitration clauses need not specifically relate to juries. We explore three groups of factors to explain the pattern of jury trial waivers: (1) contract-specific factors: {{the subject matter of}} a contract, a measure of its standardization, choice of law, and choice of forum, (2) contracting-party factors: domestic versus international status, place of business, place of incorporation, attorney locale, and industry, and (3) factors external to the contracts and parties: perceptions of jury fairness in the forum specified in the contract and the relative length of jury and bench trial queues in that forum. Contract type is significantly associated with jury trial waivers. For example, over 50 percent of security agreements and over 60 percent of credit commitments waived jury trials. In contrast, 5 percent of employment contracts, 2 percent of bond indentures, and 3. 5 percent of pooling service agreements waived jury trials. The presence of a forum selection clause, greater contract standardization, and perceived fairness of juries are significantly associated with jury trial waivers. Over 80 percent of the <b>contracts</b> <b>designating</b> Illinois as a forum contained jury trial waivers whereas less than half the <b>contracts</b> <b>designating</b> New York as a forum, and only about one-third of the <b>contracts</b> <b>designating</b> California, Texas, or Florida as a forum, contained waiver clauses. Jury trial waivers were not more common in international contracts. Our results suggest that, contrary to a widespread perception about the alleged inadequacies of juries in complex business cases, sophisticated actors may perceive that juries add value to dispute resolution...|$|R

Search focused on the opinion of scholars of hadith and fiqh (muamalah), as well as its application in Islamic Financial Institutions.

40|$|Do Walrasian markets {{function}} orderly in {{the presence}} of adverse selection? In particular, is their outcome efficient? This paper addresses these questions {{in the context of a}} Rothschild and Stiglitz insurance economy. We identify an externality associated with the presence of adverse selection as a special form of consumption externality. Consequently, we show that while competitive equilibria always exist, they are not typically incentive efficient. However, as markets for pollution rights can internalize environmental externalities, markets for consumption rights can be designed so as to internalize the consumption externality due to adverse selection. Markets for consumption rights amount to requiring that firms offering <b>contracts</b> <b>designated</b> for the ‘low risk types’ acquire the right to do so, at market-determined prices, from agents declaring to be of ’high risk’. With such markets competitive equilibria exist, are always incentive efficient and any incentive efficient allocation can be decentralized as a competitive equilibrium...|$|R
