25|$|Evidence for {{feathered}} oviraptorosaurs {{exists in}} several forms. Most directly, four species of primitive oviraptorosaurs (in the genera Caudipteryx, Protarchaeopteryx, and Similicaudipteryx) {{have been found}} with impressions of well developed feathers, most notably on the wings and tail, suggesting that they functioned at least partially for display. Secondly, at least four oviraptorosaur genera (Nomingia, Similicaudipteryx, Citipati, and Conchoraptor) preserved tails ending <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a pygostyle, a bony structure {{at the end of}} the tail that, in modern birds, is used to support a fan of feathers. Similarly, quill knobs (anchor points for wing feathers on the ulna) have been reported in the oviraptorosaurian species Avimimus portentosus. Additionally, a number of oviraptorid specimens have famously been discovered in a nesting position similar to that of modern birds. The arms of these specimens are positioned in such a way that they could perfectly cover their eggs if they had small wings and a substantial covering of feathers.|$|E

500|$|The {{film has}} gained {{criticism}} and negative reviews from war veterans and film critics. Film director and military veteran Oliver Stone has accused the film of promoting [...] "the worship of World War II {{as the good}} war," [...] and has placed it alongside films such as Gladiator and Black Hawk Down that he believes were well-made, but may have inadvertently contributed to Americans' readiness for the 2003 invasion of Iraq. In defense of the film's portrait of warfare, Brian De Palma commented, [...] "The level of violence <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> Saving Private Ryan makes sense because Spielberg is trying to show something about the brutality of what happened." [...] Actor Richard Todd, who performed in The Longest Day and was amongst {{the first of the}} Allied soldiers to land in Normandy (Operation Tonga), said the film was [...] "Rubbish. Overdone." [...] American academic Paul Fussell, who saw combat in France during World War II, objected to what he described as, [...] "the way Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, after an honest, harrowing, 15-minute opening visualizing details of the unbearable bloody mess at Omaha Beach, degenerated into a harmless, uncritical patriotic performance apparently designed to thrill 12-year-old boys during the summer bad-film season. Its genre was pure cowboys and Indians, with the virtuous cowboys of course victorious." ...|$|E

2500|$|Eliade {{says that}} secular man cannot escape his bondage to {{religious}} thought. By its very nature, secularism depends on religion for {{its sense of}} identity: by resisting sacred models, by insisting that man make history on his own, secular man identifies himself only through opposition to religious thought: [...] "He [...] recognizes himself in proportion as he 'frees' and 'purifies' himself from the 'superstitions' of his ancestors." [...] Furthermore, modern man [...] "still retains a large stock of camouflaged myths and degenerated rituals". For example, modern social events still have similarities to traditional initiation rituals, and modern novels feature mythical motifs and themes. Finally, secular man still participates <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> the eternal return: by reading modern literature, [...] "modern man succeeds in obtaining an 'escape from time' comparable to the 'emergence from time' effected by myths".|$|E

It began to expand its media presence in 2013, {{with the formation of}} a second media wing, Al-I'tisam Media Foundation, in March and the Ajnad Foundation for Media Production, specialising in nasheeds and audio content, in August. In mid-2014, ISIL established the Al-Hayat Media Center, which targets Western audiences and produces material in English, German, Russian and French. When ISIL announced its expansion to other countries in November 2014 it established media departments for the new branches, and its media apparatus ensured that the new branches follow the same models it uses in Iraq and Syria. FBI Director James Comey has said that ISIL's [...] "propaganda is unusually slick," [...] noting that, [...] "They are broadcasting... <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> 23 languages".|$|E
2500|$|Intelligence reports {{indicate}} that United States president Bill Clinton and his cabinet were aware before {{the height of the}} massacre that a [...] "final solution to eliminate all Tutsis" [...] was planned. However, fear of a repeat of the events in Somalia shaped US policy at the time, with many commentators identifying the graphic consequences of the Battle of Mogadishu as the key reason behind the US's failure to intervene in later conflicts such as the Rwandan Genocide. After the battle, the bodies of several US casualties of the conflict were dragged through the streets of Mogadishu by crowds of local civilians and members of Aidid's Somali National Alliance. According to the US's former deputy special envoy to Somalia, Walter Clarke: [...] "The ghosts of Somalia continue to haunt US policy. Our lack of response in Rwanda was a fear of getting involved <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> a Somalia all over again." [...] President Clinton has referred to the failure of the U.S. government to intervene in the genocide as one of his main foreign policy failings, saying [...] "I don't think we could have ended the violence, but I think we could have cut it down. And I regret it." [...] Eighty percent of the discussion in Washington concerned the evacuation of American citizens.|$|E

In her defence, Sandiford claimed that she had been pressured into carrying the drugs by a gang who had made threats against her children, while her lawyers argued she was suffering from mental health problems. In a statement to the court she expressed regret over her involvement, [...] "I would like to begin by apologising to the Republic of Indonesia and the Indonesian people for my involvement. I would never have become involved <b>in</b> <b>something</b> <b>like</b> this but the lives of my children were in danger and I felt I had to protect them." [...] Her son gave a statement to the court in which he said he believed she was forced to carry the drugs following a disagreement over rent money she had paid on his behalf. A report by Dr. Jennifer Fleetwood, a lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent and expert on women in the international drugs trade was also presented to the court, suggesting Sandiford was an ideal target for drug traffickers. [...] "There is … evidence to suggest that a trafficker would seek someone who was vulnerable. Having reviewed extracts from Lindsay's medical records I know that Lindsay has a history of mental health issues … This may have unfortunately made her an attractive target for threats, manipulation and coercion." ...|$|E
