500|$|YF-96A aka YF-84F aka YRF-84K: F-84E 49-2430 {{converted}} to swept wing configuration. The [...] "first prototype" [...] for the F-84F Thunderstreak. Canopy and ventral speed brake carried over from Thunderjet. Originally with a V-windscreen, later reverted {{to the standard}} Thunderjet <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen.</b> Modified by adding a fixed hook at the weapons bay and anhedral horizontal tailplane to enable FICON tests (trapeze capture) with GRB-36D mother ship. The airframe was capable of higher speeds than the Thunderjet engine could deliver. The YF-84F was a follow on with a larger engine and deepened fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|The {{fuselage}} of the SE-3101 is an uncovered, rectangular cross-section, {{steel tube}} structure. [...] An 85hp (63kW) Mathis G4R flat four engine is mounted within the fuselage, immediately below the main rotor {{and behind the}} pilot, who is provided with some instrumentation and is sheltered by a <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen.</b> The aircraft has a fixed, wheeled tricycle undercarriage, assisted by a small tail skid. First flown on 15 June 1948, development of the SE-3101 led to the Sud-Est SE-3110 and the single tail rotor SE.3120, though none of them entered production.|$|E
2500|$|They {{shared a}} semi-ellipsoidal {{aluminium}} engine cowling, split into a spinner {{from which the}} propeller protruded and with a large opening for cooling air, and a fixed rear part that reached back to the forward cabane. Behind the engine mounting the fuselage was a circular section, tapered monocoque, with the cockpit of the single-seater under a cut-out in {{the trailing edge of}} the upper wing. The absence of internal structure in the fuselage made it straightforward to extend the Limousine's fuselage by 23% to include a second cockpit. [...] At the Salon its two seats were enclosed within a rather blunt canopy or coupé with a <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> and two windows on each side. This was readily detachable and it is not known if the Limousine was flown with it in place.|$|E
50|$|During {{the mid-1980s}} they {{underwent}} their heavy C1 refurbishment at Wolverton which included new <b>flat</b> <b>windscreens,</b> a corridor {{connection between the}} Motor Vehicle (MBS) and trailer (TSO), and a PA system among other modifications.|$|R
50|$|Later new {{castings}} from EFE {{depict the}} series 1/2 Bristol VR with <b>flat</b> <b>windscreens,</b> {{and the bus}} shell version of Alexander's Y-type bodywork - the original coach shell version of this model has also been refreshed.|$|R

50|$|The RMC (Roadster) {{was an open}} 2-door, single bench seat, 2/3-seater {{version of}} the RMB with a large rear deck area and fold <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen.</b>|$|E
50|$|These {{units were}} based on the Class 310 used on the {{suburban}} services out of London Euston, but were rated for a top speed of 90 mph, and they had <b>flat</b> <b>windscreens</b> from the outset. The only significant difference between sub-classes was that the 312/1 units were also equipped to work on the 6.25 kV AC overhead electrification system used on parts of the Great Eastern Main Line and London, Tilbury and Southend Railway networks.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{distinct}} {{designs of}} front end were fitted. The first had two-piece <b>flat</b> <b>windscreens</b> which {{met at a}} slight point in the centre, EL2000-style headlights with separate indicators above, and a shallow, plain bumper. The second (and more common) had a two-piece [...] "barrel" [...] curved windscreen with level top, a slatted grille matching {{the height of the}} headlights, indicators in the headlight surrounds, and a noticeably chunkier bumper. Both windscreen styles had quarterlights.|$|R
25|$|Production variant with {{improvements}} to each batch, including chin radiators, <b>flat</b> bullet proof <b>windscreens,</b> power-boosted ailerons and increased fuel capacity, 2970 built. Some modified to pathfinder configuration and to F-5C, F-5E and F-5F.|$|R
50|$|The outward styling {{is quite}} plain, {{with a flat}} front. Two {{alternative}} windscreen styles were offered; some vehicles had a single-piece <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen,</b> whilst others had two separate flat windscreens with that on the driver's side raked back, reminiscent of some 1950s single-decker buses and the Leyland Lynx.|$|E
50|$|There {{was some}} {{variability}} in the height {{and shape of the}} side windows, and the style of windscreen. One common design of windscreen was square-cornered, tapered in towards the top and curved around to the sides. Another was a two-piece <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> with radiused outer corners. A third design used was a double-curvature windscreen with an arched top.|$|E
50|$|The {{new body}} was lower {{and had an}} {{increased}} glass area, making it look much more modern, and the old two-piece <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> {{gave way to a}} one-piece curved design. The wheelbase increased by 8 in, giving much better passenger accommodation. A heater was now a standard fitting. Bench seats were fitted in front and rear with folding centre arm rests. They were covered in Vynide, with leather available as an option.|$|E
5000|$|The Mack MC/MR series, {{also known}} as the [...] "Cruise-Hauler", is a cabover truck first {{introduced}} in 1978. It is of a distinct [...] "set back front axle" [...] design (first seen on the Mack FM), with the driver compartment mounted ahead of the front axle and with a large, <b>flat,</b> divided <b>windscreen</b> covering almost half of the truck's frontal aspect. The chassis were very common for fire apparatus.|$|R
50|$|A {{batch of}} Dennis Dominators built for Southampton Citybus have {{bodywork}} which is mostly to this style, including the downswept front upper deck window bay, {{but with a}} divided <b>flat</b> upper deck <b>windscreen</b> {{in place of the}} distinctive double-curvature screen.|$|R
50|$|Further {{development}} {{continued into}} the 1960s into what became the On Mark Marksman. The major difference was the addition of full pressurization. Improvements were also made to the cockpit with the incorporation of Douglas DC-6 <b>flat</b> glass <b>windscreens</b> and cockpit side windows. A replacement fuselage roof structure was added from the new windscreens, tapering {{back to the original}} tail section. In January 1961 the first Marksman conversion (registered N100Y) was test flown. A Supplementary Type Certificate was issued in January 1961 and deliveries commenced soon after. With the third Marksman conversion (registered N400E), designated the Marksman C, On Mark further altered the upper fuselage by creating a constant interior height to provide a headroom of about 6 ft in the passenger cabin, fitted for six or eight passengers with toilet and galley.|$|R
5000|$|He {{remarked that}} the Singer was unusual {{in having a}} {{completely}} <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> — less expensive to replace — and a good view through it was spoiled by unusually thick pillars, door surround and ventilator window surround. He put the car's fast cruising speed at 67 mph. Top gear acceleration was excellent and the engine quiet beneath its plastic bonnet. The steering column year lever was [...] "rather stiff". A central old fashioned floor-mounted lever was now available.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the SE-3101 is an uncovered, rectangular cross-section, {{steel tube}} structure.

5000|$|YF-96A aka YF-84F aka YRF-84K: F-84E 49-2430 {{converted}} to swept wing configuration. The [...] "first prototype" [...] for the F-84F Thunderstreak. Canopy and ventral speed brake carried over from Thunderjet. Originally with a V-windscreen, later reverted {{to the standard}} Thunderjet <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen.</b> Modified by adding a fixed hook at the weapons bay and anhedral horizontal tailplane to enable FICON tests (trapeze capture) with GRB-36D mother ship.

5000|$|The Beetle {{featured}} a rear-located, rear-wheel drive, air-cooled four-cylinder, boxer engine in a two-door bodywork featuring a <b>flat</b> front <b>windscreen,</b> accommodating four passengers and providing luggage storage under the front bonnet {{and behind the}} rear seat - and offering a coefficient of drag of 0.41; to this relatively good CD, the also streamlined rear of car was of help. The bodywork attached with eighteen bolts to its nearly flat chassis which {{featured a}} central structural tunnel. Front and rear suspension featured torsion bars along with front stabilizer bar - providing independent suspension at all wheels. Certain initial features were subsequently revised, including mechanical drum brakes, split-window rear windows, mechanical direction-indicators and the non-synchronized gearbox. Other features, including its distinctive overall shape, endured. In fact, the Beetle was prized for its seemingly unchanged appearance and [...] "marketed to American consumers as the anti-GM and Ford: 'We {{do not believe in}} planned obsolescence. We don't change a car for the sake of change.'" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{drophead}} coupé (DHC) had a padded, lined canvas top, which folded {{onto the}} rear deck behind the seats when retracted, and roll-up windows with opening quarter lights. The <b>flat</b> glass two-piece <b>windscreen</b> {{was set in}} a steel frame that was integrated with the body and painted the same colour. Dashboards and door-caps in both the DHC and the closed coupé (FHC) were wood-veneered, whereas the more spartan roadsters were leather-trimmed. All models had removable spats ("fender skirts" [...] in America) covering the rear wheel arches, which enhanced the streamlined look. On cars fitted with optional centre-lock wire wheels (available from 1951), the spats were omitted as they gave insufficient clearance for the chromed, two-eared Rudge-Whitworth knockoff hubs. Chromium-plated wire wheels were optional from 1953. When leaving the factory it originally fitted 6.00 × 16 inch cross ply tyres on 16 × 5K solid wheels (Pre-1951). Later cars could also specify 185VR16 Pirelli Cinturato tyres as a radial option.|$|R
50|$|Production {{vehicles}} {{began to}} enter service in 1986, {{the majority were}} bodied by Leyland at its Workington factory where the underframe was produced. All have a step entrance, Leyland offered the option of a floor with {{a step in the}} middle or one that gently ramped from aft of the front platform to the rear. A plan for offering this bus with a single-piece <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> was considred, but was not carried out. A common feature, therefore, is that the Lynx has two separate windscreens and has the driver's windscreen raked back, resembling 1950s single-decker buses and the Wright Handybus.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{truck had}} a split, flat pane windshield {{which is still}} available for certain versions, although since December 1994 the T600's cab using a curved windscreen {{was added to the}} lineup. Originally it was only for the long Aerocab and also as an option on the daycab, and it only became available for the W900S in 2006. The <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> is not available on the Aerocab or the extended daycab versions. Strangely, Kenworth offers the curved window either as a one-piece or as a two-piece with a divider in the middle. In March 1998 the very comfortable Studio Aerocab model was introduced.|$|E
5000|$|The Si 204 {{was planned}} {{as a small}} {{all-metal}} passenger aircraft with 2 crew and 8 passengers for German airline Deutsche Luft Hansa (DLH). Development was initiated in 1938. The contractor was, as usual, the RLM, but the development was conducted in close collaboration between DLH and Siebel in Halle. After {{the beginning of the}} war the aircraft was re-designed as a trainer aircraft with a full [...] "stepless" [...] glass cockpit, as had been initiated with the He 111P in early 1938, with no separate <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> for the pilot (much as almost all German bomber aircraft of the time were being designed), which seemed to be better for blind flying in the Si 204's case.|$|E
50|$|They {{shared a}} semi-ellipsoidal {{aluminium}} engine cowling, split into a spinner {{from which the}} propeller protruded and with a large opening for cooling air, and a fixed rear part that reached back to the forward cabane. Behind the engine mounting the fuselage was a circular section, tapered monocoque, with the cockpit of the single-seater under a cut-out in {{the trailing edge of}} the upper wing. The absence of internal structure in the fuselage made it straightforward to extend the Limousine's fuselage by 23% to include a second cockpit. At the Salon its two seats were enclosed within a rather blunt canopy or coupé with a <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> and two windows on each side. This was readily detachable and it is not known if the Limousine was flown with it in place.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1953, just as {{the saloon}} and {{cabriolet}} [...] "B" [...] models {{were about to be}} replaced, a [...] "Cabriolet A" [...] derived W187 Coupé was announced for 1954. The Mercedes-Benz sales department {{let it be known that}} this development was a direct response to pressing requests from leading celebrities of the time. During 1953 the manufacturer replaced the conventionally <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> on the 2/3 seater [...] "Cabriolet A" [...] with a slightly curved screen, which also found its way on to the new coupé: this was a way of highlighting the sporting nature of both models. Nevertheless, the coupé once fitted, as many were, with a steel sunroof, was at the end of 1953 offered for 22,000 Marks which was nearly twice the price for the standard W187 [...] "Limousine", and only 85 of the W187 coupés were actually sold.|$|E
5000|$|The Seafire F Mk XVII was a {{modified}} Mk XV; {{the most important}} change was the reinforced main undercarriage which used longer oleos and a lower rebound ratio. This went some way towards taming the deck behaviour of the Mk XV, reduced the propensity of the propeller tips [...] "pecking" [...] the deck during an arrested landing and the softer oleos stopped the aircraft from occasionally bouncing over the arrestor wires and into the crash barrier. Most production XVIIs had the cut down rear fuselage and teardrop canopy (the windscreen was modified to a rounded section, with narrow quarter windows, rather than the <b>flat</b> <b>windscreen</b> used on Spitfires) and an extra 33 gallon fuel tank fitted in the rear fuselage. The wings were reinforced, with a stronger mainspar necessitated by the new undercarriage, {{and they were able}} to carry heavier underwing loads than previous Seafire variants. 232 of this variant were built by Westland (212) and Cunliffe-Owen(20).|$|E
