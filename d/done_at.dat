The production schedule was short due to the film's low budget and pressure from 20th Century Fox to finish on time.|$|E

In the years after the war, the U.S. tested 1,100 compounds, and field trials of the more promising ones were <b>done</b> <b>at</b> British stations in India and Australia, in order to establish their effects in tropical conditions, as well as at the U.S.'s testing ground in Florida.|$|E

Strobe lights, smoke machines, and even Gibby Haynes' burning cymbal are still part of the presentation, but the chaotic spontaneity of their 1980s performances is no longer on display.|$|E
