25|$|Within {{hours of}} Cahill's murder, the Provisional IRA claimed {{responsibility}} {{in a press}} release. The reasons cited were Cahill's alleged involvement with a Portadown unit of the Ulster Volunteer Force. The unit in question had attempted a bomb attack on a south Dublin pub which was hosting a Sinn Féin fund-raiser on 21 May 1994. The UVF operatives were halted by the doorman Martin Doherty. In the ensuing struggle Doherty, who the IRA subsequently announced was a volunteer in their Dublin Brigade, was shot dead. The Provisionals further alleged that Cahill {{had been involved in}} selling the stolen Beit paintings to the UVF gang led by Billy Wright. The UVF then fenced the paintings for money, which they used to buy guns from South Africa. This act supposedly sealed Cahill's fate, and put him at the top of an IRA hit list. In a later statement, the IRA said that it was Cahill's involvement with and assistance to pro-British death squads which <b>forced</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> act.|$|E

[...] The Taliban also justified its attack as part of religious scripture, stating that the Quran says that [...] "people propagating against Islam and Islamic forces would be killed", going {{on to say that}} [...] "Sharia says that even a child can be killed if he is propagating against Islam".|$|E

40|$|The chapter {{argues that}} {{studying}} places and identities as a tension yields useful research insights, because it <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> do three things. First, it <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> think about places and identities as processes – as continuously configured and re-configured, {{rather than as}} predefined, entities. Second, it <b>forces</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> think about them as embodied, material processes. The concrete ways in which this tension pans out cannot be known in the abstract or a priori – they must be studied in concrete settings, as they play out in different historical moments, geographical contexts and in relation to different individuals or social groups. It therefore <b>forces</b> <b>us,</b> third, <b>to</b> think about the unequal power relations that shape these tensions, both in their global and structured {{as well as in}} their fluid, situated and embodied configurations.

2500|$|It {{was only}} from 9 January 1970, when the Supreme Court of Judicature Act came into force, that Singapore {{established}} its own Supreme Court, {{consisting of a}} Court of Appeal, Court of Criminal Appeal and High Court. In moving the Second Reading of the Bill in Parliament, the then Minister for Law and National Development, Mr. E.W. Barker, noted that [...] "the Supreme Court of Judicature Bill ... as its very name suggests, provides a proper basis for the administration of justice in our courts which should really have been introduced soon after we left Malaysia. Unfortunately, the many and varied problems which we {{had to deal with}} upon leaving Malaysia had <b>forced</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> continue with the existing system of administration of justice until the present day. All that the Bill purports to do is to set out logically the consequences that flow from our becoming independent on our own with an independent system of administration of justice separate from the system that was introduced to us while we were part of Malaysia ..." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{day after}} DNA results came back negative, Nifong and other city {{officials}} such as Durham Mayor Bill Bell {{spoke at a}} community forum on April 12, 2006, on violence against women at N.C. Central, where the accuser was a student. [...] The crowd, predominantly African American, criticized the media for portraying the accuser as a stripper and escort instead of a mother and student. [...] One questioner said that Duke University hospital must have tampered with the DNA sample for it to come back negative, while another suggested that the accuser {{ought to have been}} helicoptered to Wake Forest University Baptist Medical Center for treatment since Duke had a conflict of interest. [...] One NCCU student, Chan Hall, as quoted by Newsweek, [...] stated, [...] "It's the same old story. Duke up, Central down." [...] He continued that he wanted to see the Duke students prosecuted [...] "whether it happened or not. It would be justice for things that happened in the past." [...] NCCU Chancellor James H. Ammons Jr. said that [...] "his incident has <b>forced</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> examine issues relevant to any campus environment -- sexism, racism and the need to educate our students about sexual assault and violence against women." [...] At the same time, he urged the crowd to be patient and let the legal process take its course.|$|E

Trendafil went to collect them from the villagers. When he surrendered the arms, they shot him with a gun and the bullet scratched his eye. Then I heard Ahmet Aga command with his own mouth for Trendafil to be impaled and burnt. The words he used were [...] "Shishak aor" [...] which is Turkish for [...] "to put on a skewer (as a shish kebab). After that, they took all the money he had, undressed him, gouged his eyes, pulled out his teeth and impaled him slowly on a stake, until it came out of his mouth. Then they roasted him while he was still alive. He lived for half-an-hour during this terrible scene. At the time, I was near Ahmet Aga with other Bulgarian women. We were surrounded by Bashi-Bozouk, who had us surrounded, and <b>forced</b> <b>us</b> <b>to</b> watch what was happening to Trendafil.“ One of her children, Vladimir, who was still a baby at his mother's breast, was impaled on a sword in front of her eyes. “At the time this was happening, Ahmet Aga's son took my child from my back and cut him to pieces, there in front of me. The burnt bones of Trendafil stood there for one month and only then they were buried.” ...|$|E
