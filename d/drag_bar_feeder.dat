5000|$|CNC lathes {{and screw}} {{machines}} have accessories called [...] "bar feeders", which hold, guide, {{and feed the}} bar as commanded by the CNC control. More advanced machines may have a [...] "bar loader" [...] which holds multiple bars and feeds them {{one at a time}} into the <b>bar</b> <b>feeder.</b> <b>Bar</b> loaders are like magazines for part blanks (or pallets for milling work) in that they allow lights-out machining. The bar loader is filled with bars (or the magazine or pallet with part blanks) during working hours, and then it runs during the night unattended. Given that there is no human around to detect if something went wrong and the machine should stop, there are various kinds of sensors that are used to detect this, such as load meters, infrared beams, and, in recent years, webcams, which are placed inside the machine tool's enclosure and allow remote viewing of the cutting action.|$|R
50|$|A <b>bar</b> <b>feeder</b> feeds {{a single}} piece of bar stock into the cutting machine. As each part is machined, the cutting tool creates a final cut to {{separate}} the part from the bar stock, and the feeder continues to feed the bar for the next part, allowing for continual operation of the machine. There are two types of bar feeds used in lathe machining: Hydrodynamic bar feeds, which rest the bar stock in a series of channels whilst clamping down on {{the top and bottom of}} the bar, and hydrostatic bar feeds, which hold the bar stock in a feed tube using pressurized oil.|$|R
50|$|Before {{establishment}} of the Montrose Mining Company, several earlier bars had existed on the spot at 805 Pacific Street in Montrose. The first recorded there was The Tattooed Lady, which opened around 1970 and closed by December 1974. By that time, a new gay and <b>drag</b> <b>bar,</b> Pacific Street Station, had been established and was attracting patrons with big-name performances, such as Eartha Kitt. It is unknown when Pacific Street Station closed, but in January 1977, a new cruise bar {{by the name of}} Uncle Charlie's replaced it. Uncle Charlie's closed in March 1978.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. With ever {{increased}} demand for reduced sizes and increased complexity and accuracy, traditional machine tools have become ineffective for machining miniature components. Typical examples include dental implants, the parts used in mechanical watch movement, and the parts used in medical endoscope. With complex geometry and tight tolerance, few machine tools are capable of making them. This paper introduces our PC-based CNC Turn-Mill Machining Center. It has 5 axes, an automatic <b>bar</b> <b>feeder,</b> an automatic part collection tray, and a tool changer. In particularly, it has a special synchronization control algorithm that gives not only higher accuracy but also ease of use. In addition, to improve the accuracy, the software based volumetric error compensation system is implemented. Based on the experiment testing, the machining error is ± 3 µm in turning, ± 7 µm in milling and the maximum profile error is less than ± 7. 5 µm in gear hobbing. ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1980s Europe, {{flamboyant}} and gay 16-year-old Chance Marquis {{shows up}} at an international high school in a top hat and tails, immediately attracting {{the attention of the}} [...] "queer-hating" [...] resident bully, among others. Through his involvement in the school newspaper, he meets an introverted photographer with a mysterious briefcase, and while practicing tennis, he befriends a catty fashionista, both of whom act as his wingmen in his new high school. He also meets the jock-next-door, with whom he forms a tentative friendship, despite the jock's cacophonous group of friends. The film follows Chance through a year of high school, with its attendant drama, successes, and hijinks—including sneaking into a <b>drag</b> <b>bar,</b> where Chance begins to explore his true self.|$|R

(His colleague Everett True also heavily used the term Romo for a Plastic Fantastic review that summer) Price was invited to the aforementioned double bill edition of Club Skinny and, with the event judged a success by all concerned, not only began to cover the scene enthusiastically in his writing, converting his colleague Taylor Parkes along the way, but also opened up a second clubnight for the scene in Soho, named Arcadia. This was based at L'Equippe Anglais in Duke Street but later moved to legendary Soho <b>drag</b> <b>bar</b> Madame Jojo's.|$|R

5000|$|The album {{represents}} {{a shift in}} style from the delicate, erotic, dancefloor-friendly pop of their earlier records and contains a more eclectic mix of styles as well, from the Spanish-influenced [...] "L'Esqualita" [...] (inspired by the <b>drag</b> <b>bar</b> in New York City of the same name- the actual real name being [...] "La Escuelita") to the rockabilly-tinged [...] "Down in the Subway". The thematic elements of the songs are also noticeably darker, even for Soft Cell, and center around self-destruction and the breakdown of innocence. [...] "Meet Murder My Angel", according to Almond, is about {{the mind of a}} murderer before he slaughters his victim, while [...] "Where Was Your Heart (When You Needed It Most)" [...] centres on a girl who loses all self-esteem after being raped while intoxicated. The first single from the album was [...] "Soul Inside", which reached number 16 on the UK charts in September 1983. [...] "Down in the Subway" [...] was released as the second single, peaking at number 24 in March 1984.|$|R

40|$|Standard {{information}} {{representation in the}} manufacturing business has always focused on products with information relating to their design, geometry and required processes. However there is no standardized information model available to represent the manufacturing equipment used to produce such products. This equipment contributes as a significant investment in setting up a CNC manufacturing facility and is considered as a major asset of the business. Thus the authors see a need for an effective model to represent such equipment particularly the most expensive assets namely CNC machining systems. Such a model could represent the machine resource and also its additional auxiliary devices such as workpiece and cutting tool changing mechanisms, <b>bar</b> <b>feeders,</b> pallet/gantry systems and robotic arms. These devices can function with a CNC only when the controller's resource data model can represent their functionality. Currently every machine tool and auxiliary device manufacturer promotes their own resource data models; resulting in a plethora of representation methods which are bespoke and incomplete in terms of representing the entire system's resources. This paper proposes a Unified Manufacturing Resource Model termed UMRM. UMRM {{not only has the}} novel capability to provide the information to define the various elements of the CNC machining system, but also has the added capability to provide support for automation of process planning decision making.
