5|$|Kite: As {{written in}} the Mozi, the Zhou Dynasty philosopher, carpenter, and {{structural}} engineer Lu Ban (fl. 5th century BC) from the State of Lu created a wooden bird that remained flying {{in the air for}} three days, essentially a kite; there is written evidence that kites were used as rescue signals when the city of Nanjing was besieged by Hou Jing (died 552) during the reign of Emperor Wu of Liang (r. 502–549), while similar accounts of kites used for military signalling are found in the Tang (618–907) and Jin (1115–1234) dynasties; <b>kite</b> <b>flying</b> as a pastime can be seen in painted murals of Dunhuang dating to the Northern Wei (386–534) period, while descriptions of flying kites as a pastime have been found in Song (960–1279) and Ming (1368–1644) texts.|$|E
5|$|Wind figures {{prominently}} in several popular sports, including recreational hang gliding, hot air ballooning, <b>kite</b> <b>flying,</b> snowkiting, kite landboarding, kite surfing, paragliding, sailing, and windsurfing. In gliding, wind gradients {{just above the}} surface affect the takeoff and landing phases of flight of a glider. Wind gradient can have a noticeable effect on ground launches, also known as winch launches or wire launches. If the wind gradient is significant or sudden, or both, and the pilot maintains the same pitch attitude, the indicated airspeed will increase, possibly exceeding the maximum ground launch tow speed. The pilot must adjust the airspeed {{to deal with the}} effect of the gradient. When landing, wind shear is also a hazard, particularly when the winds are strong. As the glider descends through the wind gradient on final approach to landing, airspeed decreases while sink rate increases, and there is insufficient time to accelerate prior to ground contact. The pilot must anticipate the wind gradient and use a higher approach speed to compensate for it.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not clear}} why Cody became fascinated by <b>kite</b> <b>flying.</b> Cody liked to recount a tale that he first became {{inspired}} by a Chinese cook; who, apparently, taught him to fly kites, whilst travelling along the old cattle trail.

50|$|Kites come {{in sizes}} ranging from 0.7 square meters to 21 square meters, or even larger. In general, {{the larger the}} surface area, the more power the kite has. Kite power is also {{directly}} linked to speed, and smaller kites can be flown faster in stronger winds. The kite size—wind speed curve tapers off, so going to a larger kite to reach lower wind ranges becomes futile at a wind speed of around eight knots. Kites {{come in a variety}} of designs. Some kites are more rectangular in shape; others have more tapered ends; each design determines the <b>kite's</b> <b>flying</b> characteristics. 'Aspect ratio' is the ratio of span to length. High aspect ratios (ribbon-like kites) develop more power in lower wind speeds.|$|R
