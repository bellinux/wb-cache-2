50|$|The Easytronic {{system allows}} for a {{computer}} to assume control of the manual gearbox and clutch via electromechanical means. As of Easytronic 3.0, the gearbox can be operated in either full automatic, or sequential semi-automatic mode. In the former, the car behaves much like a traditional automatic transmission, <b>selecting</b> <b>gears</b> with no driver input; in the latter, the <b>gears</b> can be <b>selected</b> sequentially (using the <b>gear</b> <b>select</b> lever) by the driver. It also offers a traditional automatic-like 'creep' mode for low-speed maneuvering.|$|R
50|$|Rear sensors may be {{activated}} when reverse <b>gear</b> is <b>selected</b> and deactivated {{as soon as}} any other <b>gear</b> is <b>selected.</b> Front sensors may {{be activated}} manually and deactivated automatically when the vehicle reaches a pre-determined speed — to avoid subsequent nuisance warnings.|$|R
2500|$|In 1976, Honda {{introduced}} the CB750A to the United States, with the A suffix designating [...] "automatic," [...] for its automatic transmission. Although the 2-speed transmission includes a torque converter typical of an automatic transmission, the transmission {{does not automatically}} change gears for the rider. Each <b>gear</b> is <b>selected</b> by a foot-controlled hydraulic valve/selector (similar in operation to a manual transmission motorcycle). The foot selector controls the application of high pressure oil to a single clutch pack (one clutch for each <b>gear),</b> causing the <b>selected</b> clutch (and <b>gear)</b> to engage. The <b>selected</b> <b>gear</b> remains <b>selected</b> until changed by the rider, or the kickstand is lowered (which shifts the transmission to neutral).|$|R
50|$|Hall effect sensors {{sense the}} {{direction}} of requested shift, and this input, together with a sensor in the gear box which senses the current speed and <b>gear</b> <b>selected,</b> feeds into a central processing unit. This unit then determines the optimal timing and torque required for a smooth clutch engagement, based on input from these two sensors {{as well as other}} factors, such as engine rotation, the Electronic Stability Control, air conditioner and dashboard instruments.|$|E
50|$|The {{system works}} by {{dropping}} the shifter {{down into a}} gated area on the shift assembly which allows the shifter to be pushed to the right (up-shift) or to the left (down-shift). When the driver pushes the shifter in either of these directions the assembly sends {{a signal to the}} TCM to shift up, or down depending on the driver's actions. Dropping the shifter into the Autostick gate while the vehicle is moving will simply keep the vehicle in the current <b>gear</b> <b>selected.</b>|$|E
50|$|The British {{employed}} {{pneumatic valve}} bodies to regulate gear shifting by charging pistons with compressed air within the gearbox. These pneumatic pistons or gear-levers are activated {{by a series}} of valve bodies and controlled by electronic actuators linked to the gear shifter. As each gear cycle is energized, air valves open and close to engage the corresponding gear-lever. Compressed air is drawn from the braking system and in the event of loss of pressure, the transmission will remain in the last <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> or if in neutral, will not shift into gear.|$|E
50|$|All engines use an eight-speed {{automatic}} transmission. <b>Gears</b> are <b>selected</b> {{from the}} Drive Select rotary shifter on the centre console or the driver can also manually <b>select</b> <b>gears</b> via the paddle shift {{controls on the}} steering wheel.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a detailed AMT model composed of various components from multi-domains like mechanical systems (clutch, gear pair, synchronizer, etc.), pneumatic actuator systems (clutch actuation system, <b>gear</b> <b>select</b> actuation system, <b>gear</b> shift actuation system, etc.). The model is implemented using the Modelica modeling language in an objectoriented environment. The Modeling and simulation of the AMT model {{was carried out}} on MWorks, which is developed by Huazhong University of Science and Technology...|$|R

For {{developing}} {{motor driven}} automated mechanical transmission of hybrid electrical vehicle, adjust {{and control the}} <b>gear</b> <b>selecting</b> motor, the <b>gear</b> shifting motor and the clutch motor. In the research of position-PID controller and robust disturbance observer, an automated mechanical transmission system based on position-PID was given. With Matlab, the position-PID controlling arithmetic and the controlling system models of the motors were built. Experimental results show that, a highly efficient and reliable automated mechanical transmission motor control system was developed...|$|R
50|$|The {{front and}} rear of the body had minor restyling, with new front grille, {{headlights}} and taillights. The interior has been significantly upgraded. Interior upgrade includes a new instrument panel, centre console and steering wheel and new design transmission lever and handbrake. There is also a new mobile phone power outlet under the centre console. The new instrument cluster features a large multi-function digital display (single or triple-window, depending on model), which displays information such as radio station display, PRND321 <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> indicator, trip computer with stopwatch function, service reminders and a help facility.|$|E
5000|$|Frazer Nash {{were strong}} proponents {{of this system}} using one chain per <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> by dog clutches. The Frazer Nash chain drive system, (designed for the GN Cyclecar Company by Archibald Frazer-Nash and Henry Ronald Godfrey) was very effective, {{allowing}} extremely fast gear selections. The Frazer Nash (or GN) transmission system {{provided the basis for}} many [...] "special" [...] racing cars of the 1920s and 1930s, the most famous being Basil Davenport's Spider which held the outright record at the Shelsley Walsh Speed Hill Climb in the 1920s.|$|E
50|$|Under M mode, {{sequential}} gear shifts {{can be made}} {{by changing}} the gear to M+ and M-. Under M mode, the <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> will be displayed as one of M1/M2/M3/M4/M5/M6 on the dashboard. Under M mode, the gear will not change even if the engine revolution reaches the red-zone, which will lead to engine damage. However, the user is prevented from excessively downshifting to a gear that exceeds the maximum revolution possible for the engine, or excessively up-shifting to a gear that may lead the engine to stall. When the car is braked to a complete stop, the M1 gear is automatically selected.|$|E
25|$|The {{power rating}} for the engines could vary {{according}} to the type of supercharger fitted, the size of the compressor impeller(s), and the <b>gear</b> speeds <b>selected.</b>|$|R
40|$|The efficiency, weight, {{and cost}} of various {{propulsion}} system for 4 -passenger electric vehicles are compared. These systems comprise the electric motor and the required speed reducing transmission to obtain the appropriate speed at the wheel. Three types of motors, dc synchronous, and squirrel-cage were considered at 6000 ycm and 24 000 rpm for a peak power of 40 kW. Two types of <b>gearing</b> <b>selected</b> were a single speed differential and a differential with a differential with a 4 -speed gearbox.

5000|$|The first {{engine was}} built in summer 2002 and tested in the autumn. Twin {{butterfly}} valves for each throttle body were used to increase control and allow the ECU to vary the mixture flow and ignition map according to the <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> and speed. The specification of twin spark plugs per cylinder and multi-hole fuel injectors by Mark Jenner (fuelling, ignition and emission design engineer) allowed the Rocket III to meet the Euro IV emissions limits at launch. The torque curve is modified for each gear ratio, enabling over 90% of the engine’s torque output at 2,000 rpm, giving {{the high levels of}} flexibility that the designers needed. The 1,500 W starter motor on the Rocket III puts out as much power as the engine on the very first Triumph motorcycle, Siegfried Bettmann's 1902 [...] single.|$|E
5000|$|More vacuum {{is created}} in some situations. On {{deceleration}} or when descending a hill, the throttle {{will be closed}} and a low <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> to control speed. The engine will be rotating fast because the road wheels and transmission are moving quickly, but the butterfly valve will be fully closed. The flow of air through the engine is strongly restricted by the throttle, producing a strong vacuum on the engine side of the butterfly valve which will tend to limit {{the speed of the}} engine. This phenomenon, known as engine braking, is used to prevent acceleration or even to slow down with minimal or no brake usage (as when descending a long or steep hill). This vacuum braking {{should not be confused with}} compression braking (aka a [...] "Jake brake"), or with exhaust braking, which are often used on large diesel trucks. Such devices are necessary for engine braking with a diesel as they lack a throttle to restrict the air flow enough to create sufficient vacuum to brake a vehicle.|$|E
5000|$|L/1 and 2 gears {{in a full}} automatic: The MMT {{does not}} provide L/1 and 2 gears as in a full automatic. One action of the MMT system is that it detects the {{gradient}} of the slope that the car is situated in. On a down-sloping incline and if the brake pedal is depressed, it automatically selects a lower gear to produce engine brake, which has the equivalent effect of L and 2 gears in a full automatic. L and 2 can also be substituted with E1 and E2 (not available in Aygo) or M1 and M2 gears in a MMT car. To select E1 or E2, put the gear to E, and use + and - pedal flaps {{on the steering wheel}} to override the computer selection. E will change to E1/E2/E3/E4/E5/E6, depending on the <b>gear</b> <b>selected.</b> Downshift to E1 or E2 as appropriate to simulate L and 2 gears in a full automatic. To select M1 or M2, put the gear to M, and use M- gear to downshift the gear to M1 or M2.|$|E
30|$|The {{mathematical}} model is non linear and has 14 DOF (see Fig.  3), {{corresponding to the}} position and orientation of the chassis, the steering angle, {{the front and rear}} suspension travels, the front and rear wheel rotations, the engine spin rate, the front fork bending deflection and the sprocket absorber deflection. There are 7 motorcycle inputs: steering torque, throttle position, rear and front brake torques, <b>gears</b> <b>selected,</b> clutch position and the foot pegs effort (as an indirect measure of the rider’s torso motion). Suspensions and tires are modelled in detail, as well as the clutch, the gearbox and the engine. More details are given in references [9, 10].|$|R
50|$|R {{position}} of the floor-mounted shift lever means that the transmission is in reverse. This functions {{in a similar way}} to D, but there is just one reverse <b>gear.</b> When <b>selected,</b> R is highlighted in the instrument display.|$|R
50|$|A {{sequential}} {{manual transmission}} (or sequential manual gearbox) is a non-traditional type of manual transmission used on motorcycles and high-performance cars for auto racing, where <b>gears</b> are <b>selected</b> in order, and {{direct access to}} specific gears is not possible.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} a gear {{position}} {{system for the}} UMSAE race car is designed in order to know exactly which <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> in the gearbox of the car. Knowing the <b>gear</b> <b>selected</b> for the gearbox, the time spent by the PWM pneumatic clutch/shift system for shifting from one gear to another one will be greatly reduced (about 200 ms per gear shifting) ...|$|E

40|$|This project, {{entitled}} Modeling and Simulation of the Transmission System for a Chainless Electric Bicycle, {{consists in}} the design of the controllers’ logics governing a chainless electric bicycle’s transmission in order to accomplish certain behavior in front of inputs such as pedaling torque, slope gradient, frontal wind, <b>gear</b> <b>selected,</b> etc. To better understand it, a chainless electric bicycle replaces the conventional mechanical transmission (chain) by two electric machines; one in-hub motor working as a propulsion electric drive to move the bicycle and the other electric machine between the two pedaling cranks working as a generator to supply energy coming from the rider to the system. Then, each machine is controlled by a controller+power converter system. Besides, a battery is placed to act as an energy balancer whenever there is exceeding energy supplied by the generator or there is energy lack coming from the pedals and required by the motor. The main goal of the project is to design a system that could emulate a conventional bicycle in terms of cyclist feedback when riding it. One of the main problems of actual chainless electric bicycles is that the feeling of torque and speed in the rear wheel does not always correspond to the action being carried out in the pedals. Moreover, the controllers are optimally designed, and a set of riding modes (both emulating conventional bicycles and new modes thanks to the chainless proposed topology) are designed to show the great possibilities this kind of bicycles can offer in front of other commuting vehicles. The project summarizes as follows: - Research of similar options currently in the market and their weaknesses. - Mathematical model creation of the system. - Design of control algorithms for the electrical drives. - Complete system behavior checking with Matlab/Simulink. - Riding modes definition. Finally, some conclusions are presented and future related projects are brought forward to give an idea of the opportunities a chainless electric bicycle can bring...|$|E

50|$|Later, the {{manufacturer}} introduced optional semi-automatic transmissions on their medium and large saloon and estate {{models in the}} 1970s; the Citroën GS and CX models {{had the option of}} three-speed, semi-automatic transmission marketed as 'C matic'. This was simpler than the DS implementation: instead of hydraulics it used a floor mounted quadrant lever operating conventional gear selector rods and an electrically controlled wet plate clutch in conjunction with a torque converter. The torque converter gave more of the feel of a conventional automatic transmission, which was completely lacking in the DS. Citroën semi-automatic transmission of this era made no use of electronics: the entire <b>gear</b> <b>selecting</b> operation was carried out by simply moving the gear lever from one ratio to the next.|$|R

50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} by gear ratios that are selectable by locking <b>selected</b> <b>gear</b> pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (planetary) gearing controlled by brake bands and/or clutch packs to <b>select</b> <b>gear</b> ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually <b>select</b> the current <b>gear</b> are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no {{distinction between the two}} terms need be made.|$|R
50|$|In most {{vehicles}} with manual transmission, <b>gears</b> are <b>selected</b> by manipulating a lever called a gear stick, shift stick, gearshift, gear lever, gear selector, or shifter {{connected to the}} transmission via linkage or cables and mounted on the floor, dashboard, or steering column. Moving the lever forward, backward, left, and right into specific positions <b>selects</b> particular <b>gears.</b>|$|R
50|$|The FZ750 uses a {{six-speed}} sequential close ratio gearbox; {{the gear}} shafts are only removable by splitting the crankcase halves.The clutch {{is of the}} wet, multi-plate type and is hydraulically operated. Final drive is by O-ring chain and sprockets. A safety feature of the FZ750 is that the engine ignition is cut if first <b>gear</b> is <b>selected</b> with the sidestand down; this is commonplace on modern motorcycles.|$|R
50|$|The TCU {{provides}} {{information about the}} health of the transmission, such as clutch wear indicators and shift pressures, and can raise trouble codes and set the malfunction indicator lamp on the instrument cluster if a serious problem is found.
