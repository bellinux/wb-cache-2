5|$|Antibody {{tests in}} {{children}} younger than 18months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies. Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA, or via testing for the p24 antigen. Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing. In sub-Saharan Africa as of 2007–2009 between 30 and 70% of the population were aware of their <b>HIV</b> <b>status.</b> In 2009, between 3.6 and 42% {{of men and women}} in Sub-Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years.|$|E
5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown <b>HIV</b> <b>status</b> has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested in duplicate. If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

Mark takes the rejection badly and stops taking his HIV medication. During Christmas that year, he is rushed to hospital after collapsing. When Shelley finds out that Mark is ill, she returns and admits that she really cares for him and they reconcile. However, Shelley tries to rush things by asking Mark to meet her family and go on holiday with her parents. She becomes infatuated and tries to spend as much time with him as she can. Mark fears that the relationship is moving too quickly and Mark decides to end it. When he tries to tell Shelley this, she uses emotional blackmail to stop him, saying that she has risked her health being with him so he owes her.

40|$|A {{survey was}} {{undertaken}} of homosexual and bisexual men in Brisbane to establish whether {{knowledge of their}} human immunodeficiency virus (<b>HIV)</b> -antibody <b>status</b> had influenced any sexual behaviour that was likely to spread HIV type 1 (HIV- 1). Of the 318 respondents, 123 respondents knew their <b>HIV</b> serological <b>status,</b> and 13 of these were HIV seropositive. Of the 195 respondents who previously had not been tested, 10 individuals proved to be HIV seropositive. Eighty-two per cent of subjects stated that they had reduced their sexual activity because of their awareness of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); this reduction was equally common among those who had or had not previously had their <b>HIV</b> serological <b>status</b> checked. Anal intercourse was practised most frequently by those subjects who were HIV seropositive and {{were not aware of}} it; nevertheless, unprotected anal intercourse was common among subjects who knew their <b>HIV</b> serological <b>status,</b> including those who knew that they were HIV seropositive. Eighty-nine of 208 subjects who were practising anal intercourse had never used a condom. Usage of a condom was marginally more common among those subjects who previously had been tested for the presence of HIV antibodies (P = 0. 06), and this was particularly so for those subjects who knew that they were HIV seropositive (P < 0. 01). Condom usage was no more common among those subjects who knew that they were HIV seronegative, when compared with those subjects who did not know their status. These data show that knowledge of a negative HIV-antibody test-result has no substantial association with safer sexual behaviour and suggest that whereas targeted information programmes have had some impact on behaviour in high-risk groups in Brisbane, by the end of July 1986, these programmes had not yet resulted in safer sexual practices by the majority of homosexual and bisexual men...|$|R
40|$|Magister Artium (Sport, Recreation and Exercise Science) - MA(SRES) Athletes are at {{risk for}} HIV {{infection}} due to their celebrity status which enables them to associate with multiple concurrent sexual partnerships. Athletes with an <b>HIV</b> sero-positive <b>status</b> should be encouraged to disclose their <b>HIV</b> positive <b>status</b> to enable them access appropriate treatment, care and support. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore the experiences of athletes living with HIV following disclosure of their sero-status. The study was conducted in Ndirande Township in the city of Blantyre, Malawi. Twelve purposively sampled athletes living with HIV, four males and eight females between the ages of 18 and 30 years, participated in this study. Data was collected using qualitative methods conducting semi-structured, face to face individual interviews and the data were analysed using thematic analysis. The consequence of disclosure model was used to explain the themes that emerged from the data. The results of the study indicated that all athletes disclosed their <b>HIV</b> seropositive <b>status.</b> The majority of the athletes disclosed their <b>HIV</b> positive <b>status</b> to spouses, family members, friends and health care providers in order to access support and treatment. However, athletes did not disclose to their clubs and sports institutions because there was no conducive environment. After disclosure of their status, most athletes had positive experiences that included increased psychosocial support and care from their social networks. Some athletes had negative experiences such as stigma and discrimination from teammates and distant relatives. While athletes living with HIV had support from families and community support groups, there was a lack of appropriate support systems in the sport institutions. In addition, athletes living with HIV had limited access to health care services. For athletes living with HIV to remain productive, there is need for further research and the establishment of appropriate support systems in different levels of the sport institutions...|$|R

25|$|The rapid {{expansion}} of testing infrastructure has been largely prompted {{by the introduction of}} provider-initiated routine testing campaigns to identify infected individuals and put them in contact with treatment services. Client-initiated testing was failing to identify most infected individuals, so campaigns to screen high-risk groups, including drug users, commercial sex workers, prisoners, and former plasma donors, were commissioned to link patients to treatment services. The campaigns have resulted in a substantial {{increase in the number of}} individuals who know their <b>HIV</b> <b>status,</b> with an additional 60,000 people living with HIV/AIDS identified. This increased identification explains, at least in part, the rapid rise in reported HIV cases in the early 21st century.

25|$|UNAIDS has {{observed}} “sero-selection” (choosing a partner {{based on their}} <b>HIV</b> <b>status)</b> becoming increasingly prevalent in partner choice and transmission in the United States. A 2008 CDC study found that one in five (19%) of MSM in major U.S. cities were infected with HIV and almost half (44%) were unaware of their infection. Many HIV-infected individuals do not seek treatment until late in their infection (an estimated 42% do not seek treatment until they begin to experience signs of illness.) Furthermore, {{a significant portion of}} individuals who are tested for HIV never return for their test results. Studies have advocated for funding and implementation of HIV tests that can be administered outside medical settings since 2003. Home testing is considered especially important because 8%-39% of partners tested in studies of partner counseling and referral services (PCRS) were found to have a previously undiagnosed HIV infection that their partner was unaware of.|$|E

Mental health issues were confronted in 1996 when 16-year-old Joe Wicks developed schizophrenia following the off-screen death of his sister in a car crash. The long-running storyline of Mark Fowler's HIV was so successful in raising awareness that in 1999, a survey by the National Aids Trust found teenagers got most of their information about HIV from the soap, though one campaigner noted that in some ways the storyline was not reflective of what was happening at the time as the condition was more common among the gay community.
