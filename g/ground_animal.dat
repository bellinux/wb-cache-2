40|$|This paper {{examines}} whether non-human {{animals have}} a moral right not to be experimented upon. It adopts a Razian conception of rights, whereby an individual possesses a right if an interest of that individual is sufficient to impose a duty on another. To ascertain whether animals have a right not to be experimented on, three interests are examined which might found such a right: the interest in not suffering, the interest in staying alive, and the interest in being free. It is argued that while the first two of these interests are sufficient to <b>ground</b> <b>animal</b> rights against being killed and made to suffer by experiments, the interest in freedom does not ground a general animal right not {{to be used in}} experimentation...|$|E
40|$|Social Contract {{theorists and}} animal advocates {{seem to have}} agreed to go their {{separate}} ways. Contractarians have avoided attempting to address an issue that seems destined to prove embarrassing for the theory given the current political climate. It is largely thought that contractarianism affirms the meager moral standing commonly attributed to most animals. In {{the face of this}} consensus, animal advocates who feel the need to philosophically ground the moral status of animals have turned to other potential sources. This is not a hard choice for animal advocates to make: utilitarianism is a respectable moral theory that affords animals moral consideration with relative ease. Nevertheless, we argue that this separation is a mistake. Contractarians can offer an account of the moral status of animals that is at least as compelling as that offered by utilitarianism. Grounding the moral worth of animals in contract theory also produces an importantly different account, one that can <b>ground</b> <b>animal</b> rights, as opposed to mere considerability, which some animal advocates will find more appealing than the utilitarian alternative...|$|E
40|$|Arriving at the Farm The {{ultimate}} goal of farming is not the growing of crops, but the cultivation and perfection of human beings (Fukuoka 2009). In recent decades many countries have bettered themselves by altering farming practices to include animal welfare standards. By finding a common <b>ground,</b> <b>animal</b> agriculture and animal advocates can work together to improve animal welfare. This case study will review California Senate Bill 1520 Force-Fed Birds to examine how the stakeholders in an active legislative battle are working through the controversy {{to find a place}} where all parties can thrive. This legislation was brought to the California legislature by Senator Burton and was passed in 2004, making it illegal to force feed ducks and geese within California as well as to sell force fed foie gras in California. This was a giant leap forward for animal welfare, providing farmers with a standard to meet by outlawing all force-feeding products within its borders. Yet, many wonder if this legislation goes too far and are concerned that this might be the beginning of government overreach with the government regulating what we are allowed and not allowed to eat. Through the analysis of this foie gras case study, we can begin to understand the complex issues of animal welfare versus animal agriculture...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{determined}} a biodiversity {{index of}} <b>ground</b> <b>animal</b> species using the indirect remotesensing approach for large-scale mapping. Remotely sensed data acquired from World View 2 satellite data {{were used to}} obtain biophysical parameters, where all these parameters are then utilized for modelling of animal biodiversity mapping in a green landscape of Universiti Teknologi Malaysia campus. Three biodiversity indices, namely, species richness, evenness, and diversity were mapped and analyzed against ground truth obtained from unmanned sensor-camera trappings. The biophysical parameters derived from the remote sensing and ancillary information for the mammal habit at heterogeneity was categorized based on relevancy to vegetation density and moisture presence within the canopy and vegetated areas. Results of this study demonstrate the utility of satellite remote sensing, especially with {{the new generation of}} fine spatial and spectral data such as World View 2 data, for mapping animal biodiversity at large scale. The derived richness, diversity and evenness indices were shown to agree fully with the in-situ observations.

The subject under examination addresses main design types that reflect {{the style of the}} region and among many tribes; those which had been selected are qualified within Turkish Shaman cultural criterion and they had been limited to some major tribes which are: Altai, Yakut, Hakas, Tuva, Tofa and Dolgan tribes. The Shaman clothing which passes from father to son through inheritance or “Call Method” has been considered a form of sacred cult articles which were accepted as cosmic accessories that would transfer one into another universe which in turn has separated the owner {{from the rest of the}} members of the community and became the symbol of their isolated lifestyle.

However, it is possible to come across Shaman clothes designs which depict both aerial and <b>ground</b> <b>animals</b> together which form the basis of the oldest Turkic Shaman costumes. Style and design have been noticed as different concepts in Shaman costumes which form a religious cosmography when stood alone. As style is to do with “expression” side of the shaman’s dress, design is related to “the form” of it. Based on this, style is developed in a way which is in symbolic expression of shamanic person these are shapes of aerial and <b>ground</b> <b>animals.</b> However, the design reflects the signs of modification either on the basis of functionality or meaning throughout the time due to interaction. New forms being added and new designs being made indicates us the national development of system of shamanism.

50|$|This {{experiment}} {{intended to}} show that memory could be transferred chemically. The experiment was repeated with mice, fish, and rats, but it always failed to produce the same results.

McConnell believed that this was evidence of a chemical basis for memory, which he identified as memory RNA. McConnell's results are now attributed to observer bias. No blinded experiment has ever reproduced his results of 'maze-running'.
