2500|$|But Edmunds {{also had}} admirers. One Democrat with {{no reason to}} {{appreciate}} him wrote a colleague that among all the Republicans, [...] "Edmunds made the most impression upon me. [...] I couldn't help admiring his clear and incisive way of putting a question, although it appeared to me that his manner is occasionally very irritating. [...] This manner of his is very much that of a lawyer employed as counsel in a case, who therefore makes ex parte statements, and thinks <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> make all manner of allegations."

2500|$|If the Board of Directors of the {{co-operative}} cannot {{resolve the}} member issue, {{which is a}} cause for possible termination of occupancy rights, it can pass a motion to send the member a notice to appear requiring the member to attend at a Board meeting at which the termination (eviction) of that member's occupancy [...] will be considered. If the Board votes to terminate an occupancy (evict), the member has a right of appeal to the membership as a whole. In order to enforce the eviction, the Board must bring an application to a judge of the Superior Court, on which occasion the member {{has the opportunity to}} present his/her case to the judge; the judge considers whether the eviction process was conducted fairly and in accordance with due process, and has a residual discretion to refuse the eviction should the judge consider <b>it</b> <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> do so, notwithstanding the decision of the Board. Sometimes this hearing is conducted like a trial, with oral evidence from both sides, while at other times it is conducted based only on written documents submitted to the court; the practice varies from judge-to-judge and courthouse to courthouse, and there is no consensus on the proper procedure or what right a member has to be heard. This process is different from evictions of rental tenants, which proceed in Ontario before a specialized tribunal and in which the tenant is always entitled to an oral hearing. The standard of deference that judges should show to the decisions of Boards is a controversial and unresolved issue in the law, with various cases taking seemingly inconsistent positions on the issue. As of 2012 new provincial legislation in Ontario will allow housing co-operatives to apply to a special tribunal to obtain a [...] "writ of possession" [...] to evict a member from their unit.|$|E
