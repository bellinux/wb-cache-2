25|$|The index {{typewriter}} {{was briefly}} popular in niche markets. Although they were slower than keyboard type machines they were mechanically simpler and lighter, they were therefore marketed as being suitable for travellers, {{and because they}} could be produced more cheaply then keyboard machines, as budget machines for users who needed to produce small quantities of typed correspondence. The index typewriter's niche appeal however soon disappeared, as {{on the one hand}} new keyboard typewriters became lighter and more portable and on the other refurbished second hand machines began to become available. The last widely available western <b>index</b> <b>machine</b> was the Mignon typewriter produced by AEG which was produced until 1934. Considered one of the very best of the index typewriters, part of the Mignon's popularity was that it featured both interchangeable indexes and type, allowing the use of different fonts and character sets, something very few keyboard machines allowed and only at considerable added cost.|$|E

The flame retardant of the modified whiskers/PE composites was better than the unmodified. The morphology of fracture was analyzed by SEM: the modified whisker could be more evenly divided into PE matrix with better dispersibility and compatibility, for that there occurred organic molecule membranes {{on the surface of the}} crystal whiskers after being modified, which lowered the interfacial energy of whiskers...|$|E

Ten subjects performed 19 consecutive task periods using the ARMin robot while difficulty was varied along two scales. Three physiological modalities were measured: electroencephalography, {{autonomic nervous system}} (ANS) responses (electrocardiography, skin conductance, respiration, skin temperature) and eye tracking. After each task period, reference workload and effort values were collected using the NASA Task Load <b>Index.</b> <b>Machine</b> learning was used to estimate workload and effort from physiological data. All three physiological modalities performed significantly better than random, particularly using nonlinear estimation algorithms. The most important ANS responses were respiration and skin conductance, while the most important electroencephalographic information was obtained from frontal and central sites. However, all three physiological modalities were outperformed by task performance and movement data. This suggests that future studies should try to demonstrate advantages of physiological measurements over other information sources...|$|E

40|$|The {{compliant}} wrist combining passive compliants and sensor {{has been developed}} in GRASP laboratory. The device provides the robot system the necessary flexibility which accommodates transitions as the robot makes contact with the environment, corrects positioning error in automatic assembly, avoids high impact forces and protects the surface from damage. The device also supplies the displacement sensing of the passive compliance so that active feedback control is possible. This report is intended {{to serve as a}} reference material to introduce the control software of the robot {{compliant wrist}} system developed and implemented in the lab. The detail discussion on system performance and parameters selection {{can be found in the}} thesis [3]. The rest of material is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the compliance control methods of robot manipulators. The historic development of both passive and active compliance method is discussed. The advantages and disadvantages of the methods are investigated. Based on the unsolved problems in this issue, the six-degree freedom compliant wrist is developed, and the design feature is presented. Section 3 discusses the hybrid position/force control scheme using the sensing information from the device. The positioning error due to load or external force when robot moves in free space is compensated for, so that the effective stiffness is increased. In force control when robot is constrained by environment, the trajectory is modified by sensed force, so that the effective stiffness is decreased. Section 4 deals with the implementation of the control scheme. Various programs have been developed to perform the hybrid control operations, such as hybrid control demonstration, surface tracking, edge tracking, insertion and pulling out, and writing operation. The programs have been successfully implemented in the experiments. Definition and selection of the parameters in the programs are discussed.

In this paradigm, a novel Nonnegative Matrix Factorization (NMF) algorithm is applied on histograms of counts (relating to a bag of features representation of the content) to jointly discover latent structuring patterns and their activations in time. Our NMF variant employs the Kullback-Leibler divergence as a cost function and imposes a temporal smoothness constraint to the activations. It is solved by a majorization-minimization technique. The approach proposed {{is meant to be}} generic and is particularly well suited to applications where the structuring patterns may overlap in time. As such, it is evaluated on two person-oriented video structuring tasks (one using the visual modality and the second the audio). This is done using a challenging database of political debate videos. Our results outperform reference results obtained by a method using Hidden Markov Models. Further, we show the potential that our general approach has for audio speaker diarization.

40|$|Abstract—Nowadays, ontologies are {{the only}} widely {{accepted}} paradigm {{for the management of}} sharable and reusable knowledge in a way that allows its automatic interpretation. They are collaboratively created across the Web and used to index, search and annotate documents. The vast majority of the ontology based approaches, however, focus on indexing texts at document level. Recently, with the advances in ontological engineering, it became clear that information indexing can largely benefit from the use of general purpose ontologies which aid the indexing of documents at word level. This paper presents a concept indexing algorithm, which adds ontology information to words and phrases and allows full text to be searched, browsed and analyzed at different levels of abstraction. This algorithm uses a general purpose ontology, OntoRo, and an ontologically tagged corpus, OntoCorp, both developed {{for the purpose of this}} research. OntoRo and OntoCorp are used in a two-stage supervised machine learning process aimed at generating ontology tagging rules. The first experimental tests show a tagging accuracy of 78. 91 % which is encouraging in terms of the further improvement of the algorithm.

Although it is controversial, most of universities are in the process on how to accomplish the international recognition, particularly in global dissemination. Responding to that, this research is aimed at investigating the internationalization of academic journals at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang dealing with accessibility, credibility and prestige in the process to elevate the quality of academic journals that are published online or printed version. By employing the descriptive qualitative research, focusing on case study, this research collected the data through focused group discussions and spreading a number of questions from google form to gain data about the reasons and the expectations on the enhancement of academic journals. In so doing, this research found several aspects harnessed by the academic journal managers and the academics. The main issues are centered on enlarging the accessibility of journal publication to accentuate the criteria of accessibility and credibility. The last topic concentrates on the intention of the writers to purposively choose journal at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang as a media for publication. The findings exemplify that the internationalization in the part of accessibility is done by registering the journals on <b>index</b> <b>machines</b> and using international language to widely attract readers not restricted from Indonesian. Those can influence the number of visitors that can be detected from flag counter application. In addition, the performance of the website that can be analyzed by using the tools such as GTMetrix, ALEXA, THAT Web, and STAT Show shows the enhancement on the performance of academic journal websites. The results present that the journals with the natural science scopes have better performance than other journals with the more specific research areas. The credibility of journals was investigated through the number of citations on each journal. In this case, some of natural science journals show larger citations that those of social science journals. The diversification of the journal editors and reviewers on the natural science and social study remain less-heterogeneous. Based on the research findings, this research concludes that the academic journals at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang need an improvement and more strategic ways to be indexed at the internationally <b>indexed</b> <b>machines,</b> such as Scopus and Thomson Reuters. By fulfilling the requirements that are obliged by those two index and citation brands, the academic journals at UIN Maulana Malik Ibrahim Malang can be internationally accredited. Therefore, there should be a good cooperation from the policy makers on the institutions with the academics, educational staffs and students to widely published their research articles.
