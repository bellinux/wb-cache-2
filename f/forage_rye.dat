40|$|Cropping systems {{involving}} legumes {{are increasing}} {{due to the}} costs and environmental concerns attributed to N fertilizer. A green manure cover crop in a cropping system can benefit the soil by improving fertility and disrupting disease, insect or weed cycles. Two studies were conducted during two years at the Texas A&M AgriLife Research and Extension Center at Overton, TX. Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata [L. ] Walp) was evaluated as a multifunctional legume in a double cropping system with <b>forage</b> <b>rye</b> (Secale cereale L.), and 37 cowpea plant introduction (CPI) lines were evaluated for seed and biomass production. These studies measured cowpea biomass production, seed yield, carbon and nitrogen plant concentrations, and soil N contributions. Primary objectives were to 1) maximize rye biomass production through the incorporation of cowpea biomass in combination with different nitrogen rates concurrently; and 2) evaluate new CPI lines for traits needed in the cropping system and for potential seed production. The green manure cover crop of cowpea showed no impact (P ? 0. 34) compared to fallow plots when comparing rye biomass in 2015 and in 2016 (P ? 0. 26). Nitrogen rates had a positive linear relationship with rye biomass for 2015 (r^ 2 = 0. 79) and 2016 (r^ 2 = 0. 97). The lack of response of soil N from the summer green manure cover crop may be likely due to the soil type. Darco loamy fine sand (loamy, siliceous, semiactive, thermic Grossarenic Paleudult), is an excessively drained soil and has very little nutrient holding capacity. The CPI lines were evaluated based on biomass production and seed yield by late September to incorporate into a cropping system with <b>forage</b> <b>rye,</b> and nematode resistance. Cowpea biomass production peaked at 3021 kg ha^- 1 in 2015 and at 6009 kg ha^- 1 in 2016. Cowpea seed yield ranged from 0 to 2322 kg ha^- 1 in 2016 and 9 to 351 kg ha^- 1 in 2015. One CPI line was identified with root-knot nematode resistance. Separately the CPI lines exhibited valuable traits such as biomass production, seed yield, and nematode resistance and will be further evaluated for additional breeding programs...|$|E
40|$|Cultivation of game plots is {{a common}} {{traditional}} practice in Hungarian game management. However, it has significant costs. Efficiency of this measure therefore, should be controlled. In our study we investigated the utilisation of four game plots and food plot <b>forage</b> (<b>rye,</b> Secale cereale) in Valkó throughout an entire year from April 2007 to March 2008. Our study aim {{was to determine the}} intensity of area use by deer on food plots and estimate the biomass of the food plot forage consumed. We conducted faeces counts in every 2 or 4 week. We also measured the difference between the total biomass of grazed and ungrazed plant individuals and that of enclosed (untouched) and control (grazed) sampling areas. We found that red deer appear in food plots in every season, although there were clear differences in the deer dropping density between different periods. The highest values of the intensity of area use in game plots were revealed in autumn (October-November). However, {{in the first half of}} the year there was no significant difference in the deer faces density between the game plots and control forest areas. Similarly, significantly more plant biomass was consumed (has disappeared) from the food plot forage during the September-October period (30 - 90 kg/ha/day) than in the other parts of the year (0 - 10 kg/ha/day). We suggest that food plot forage – or at least rye – has no fundamental dietary significance for red deer. Since the utilisation of game plots and food plot forage became the highest in the roaring period in autumn, importance of social factors in visiting game plots can be more fundamental than that of dietary ones. We think that it is hard to prove the clear dietary benefits of food plot forage for red deer at a population level. However, increasing effectiveness of trophy hunting during the roaring season could be an achievable and more easily measurable goal of game plot management. ...|$|E
40|$|Grain: Cereal rye {{is grown}} as a grain crop for {{alcoholic}} beverages, food, livestock feed, and seed (Oelke et al., 1990).

The feeding studies described here were conducted to demonstrate absorption of tricarballylate by ruminant animals fed diets similar to those producing grass tetany. When sheep were switched from a diet containing alfalfa (lucerne) (Medicago sativa L.) hay (no detectable trans-aconitate) to wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and rye (Secale cereale L.) forage containing 1. 52 and 1. 37 % trans-aconitate, respectively, there was a rapid increase in blood plasma tricarballylate.

40|$|An {{integrated}} crop-livestock {{system was}} evaluated {{as an alternative}} to conventional cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) system in the Texas high Plains. Integrated crop-livestock systems can decrease the amount of inputs used including irrigation water and a higher intensity of land use. Furthermore, there is a great amount of agronomic evidence that crop-livestock systems have a lower negative impact on the environment but to fully asses their feasibility to potentially replace conventional cotton systems in the Texas high Plains their economic profitability must also be evaluated. Four yield and variable cost scenarios were simulated for the years 1998 to 2004 in two systems established in the Texas High Plains to compare a conventional cotton system using management practices recommended by the Texas Cooperative Extension Service vs. an integrated crop-livestock system for production of cotton and feedlot ready stocker steers that included WW-B. Dahl [Bothriochloa bladhii (Retz.), S. T. Blake] as a perennial <b>forage</b> and <b>rye</b> (Secale cereale L.) and wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in alternate yearly rotation with cotton for grazing by steers. Cotton produced under the conventional system and cotton produced under the integrated system achieved similar results regarding yields and input use. Favorable scenarios for the integrated system and cotton monoculture were when the yields were increased and when VC were decreased; both scenarios produced higher net returns in the integrated system than in cotton monoculture. Livestock produced in the integrated system was found to be advantageous because of the possibility to obtain additional revenue without significantly increasing the overall fixed cost of the integrated system...|$|R

In Trials 2 and 3 (1986 - 87), barley and <b>rye</b> <b>forage</b> yields were lower than wheat yields. In all three years, wet weather conditions made hay-making difficult.

Triticale and Centurk wheat forages were high in fiber, and their dough silages had low intakes and digestibilities.

The soil is sandy loam {{with an average}} of 16. 4 % clay, 67. 6 % sand, and 0. 65 g kg− 1 OM at 0 – 10 cm. The crops evaluated were rotations of grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor L.) or forage sorghum (also called haygrazer), cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), and winter rye (Secale cereale) : grain sorghum–cotton (Srg–Ct), cotton–winter rye– sorghum (Ct–Rye–Srg), and <b>forage</b> sorghum–winter <b>rye</b> (Srf– Rye). The tillage treatments did not affect soil MB and EAs of C cycling (i. e., β-glucosidase, β-glucosaminidase, α- galactosidase), P cycling (alkaline phosphatase, phosphodiesterase), and S cycling (arylsulfatase) —except for separation due to tillage for Srf–Rye and Ct–Rye–Srg observed in PCA plots when all EAs were evaluated together. After 3 years, rotations with a winter cover crop history (Ct–Rye–Srg and Srf–Rye) enhanced soil MBN (up to 63 %) and EAs (21 - 37 %) compared to Srg–Ct. After 5 years, Srg–Ct and Ct–Rye–Srg showed similar soil MBC, MBN, EAs, total carbon (TC), and organic carbon (OC). A comparison of Srg–Ct plots with nearby continuous cotton (Ct–Ct) research plots in the same soil revealed that it took 5 years to detect higher TC (12 %), MBC (38 %), and EAs (32 – 36 %, depending on the enzyme) under Srg–Ct. The significant improvements in MB and EAs found, as affected by dryland cropping systems with a history of winter cover crops and/or higher biomass return crops than cotton, can represent changes in soil OM, nutrient cycling, and C sequestration for sandy soils in the semiarid Texas High Plains region. It is significant that these soil changes occurred despite summer crop failure (2003 and 2006) and lack of winter cover crops (2006) due to lack of precipitation in certain years...|$|R

Dissertations, Academic [...] University of Missouri [...] Columbia [...] Agronomy. Annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and cereal rye (Secale cereale L.) are two forages that fit well into mixed row crop/livestock operations as they can be used both as a cover crop and as a source of winter pasture. Few researchers have studied how to integrate these forages in a soybean [Glycine max (L.) Merrill]-winter pasture-corn (Zea mays L.) rotation. An experiment was conducted where each of these forage species was overseeded at different stages of soybean development, and corn was grown as a subsequent crop. Soybean yield was not altered by overseeding annual ryegrass or cereal rye. All treatments yielded over 2, 500 kg ha- 1 for the season (with a high of 4, 200 kg ha- 1), which would supply much needed pasture for winter grazing. While all treatments were adequate sources of forage, overseeding at the R 6. 5 stage consistently produced the greatest yields for both annual ryegrass and cereal <b>rye.</b> <b>Forage</b> quality from annual ryegrass was slightly better than for cereal rye, but both had crude protein levels of more than 170 g kg- 1 and neutral detergent fiber of less than 559 g kg- 1. The overseeded treatments had at least 60 % more residue cover and at least 70 % less weed cover than did the control plots. Corn yield in the following year was not altered by overseeding. The results of the experiment demonstrate that livestock operations in the lower Midwest could use cereal rye and annual ryegrass overseeded into soybean for winter grazing...|$|R

In experiment 1, three Hanwoo steers (600 ± 47 kg), each permanently fitted with a ruminal cannula were used. In this experiment, three diets designated as T 1, TMRF (18. 4 % fermented feed, tall fescue, mammoth wild <b>rye</b> <b>forage</b> and whole crop barley); T 2, TMRF (17. 7 % fermented feed, rice straw and whole crop barley); and T 3, TMR (rice straw, whole crop barley and probiotics, but no fermented feed), which were subjected to rumen in vitro fermentation for 48 h. The results demonstrated that DM disappearance rate gradually increased with advancing fermentation time, but T 1 and T 2 were higher than the T 3 (p 0. 05) at 24 and 48 h. None of the specific VFAs were affected except for acetic and non volatile lactic acids, which were produced more in T 2 than in T 1 and T 3 at 24 h and 48 h of incubation. A/P was lower in T 1 and T 2 than inT 3 at 24 h (p 0. 05) of incubation. These results confirmed that TMRF-related treatment shows a superior performance to that of TMR during the ruminal fermentation period. In experiment 2, the three diets in experiment 1 plus 1 more control diet (concentrates, probiotics and 2 % rice straw of body weight) were fed to the 48 Hanwoo steers (160 ± 10 kg) {{for a period of}} 168 d. The results demonstrated that the daily and total live weight gain and feed efficiency were higher (p< 0. 05) in the TMRF and TMR groups than in the control group. SGOT, SGPT and BUN (p< 0. 05) were reduced in TMRF relative to the control and TMR groups by 168 d which confirmed that TMRF shows better blood profiles than the TMR and control groups. Overall, these results appear to show that TMRF has better in vitro ruminal characteristics than those of TMR; growth performance and blood profiles were also found to be superior in TMRF than in the TMR and control groups. Thus, our findings suggest that TMRF-based feed supplies are favorable for Hanwoo cattle...|$|R

Foi avaliado o efeito do tipo de dieta sobre o fluxo duodenal de ácidos graxos de cadeia longa em novilhos. As dietas testadas foram: convencional (dieta de confinamento constituída de 60 % de silagem de milho e 40 % de concentrado); silagem de forrageira temperada - azevém (Lolium multiflorum, Lam); ou silagem de forrageira tropical - associação de milheto (Pennisetum americanum, Leeke + capim-papuã, Brachiaria plantaginea). Foram utilizados seis novilhos mestiços Charolês × Nelore canulados no duodeno, em duplo quadrado latino 3 × 3. O consumo de matéria seca (MS) foi semelhante entre os grupos (média de 4. 037 g/dia), mas o consumo de ácidos graxos totais e de ácidos graxos saturados foi mais alto no grupo que recebeu silagem de forrageira tropical. Por outro lado, os animais que receberam a dieta convencional consumiram maior quantidade de ácidos graxos insaturados. A silagem de forrageira tropical proporcionou maior consumo de ácido vacênico (C 18 : 1 t- 11) e a de forrageira temperada maior consumo de ácido linoleico conjugado.
