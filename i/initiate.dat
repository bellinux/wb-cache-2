The fracture geometry was simple when the fracture <b>initiated</b> from the sandstone layer; in most cases, the fracture propagated {{perpendicular to the}} direction of the minimum horizontal stress. When the fracture <b>initiated</b> from the coal layer, the fracture morphology was more complex with three main patterns: (1) The hydraulic fracture <b>initiated</b> and propagated alongside the natural fracture, partially diverging due to in situ stress and forming secondary fractures. (2) The hydraulic fracture <b>initiated</b> and propagated in {{the direction of the}} maximum horizontal stress. (3) Multiple fractures <b>initiated</b> and propagated simultaneously.|$|R

Bills are debated and passed separately in each house, but must be passed by both houses before they can submitted to the governor. Each law passed by the General Assembly must be applied uniformly to the entire state; the General Assembly has no authority to create legislation that targets only a particular community.|$|E

5|$|If {{the player}} wishes {{to take over}} a {{territory}} through diplomatic means, they must <b>initiate</b> dialogue with the local leader. If the player has a high enough popularity, the local leader may invite them to a sporting event, such as elephant race or a game hunting session, which will give the player an opportunity to unite that territory under their faction. If the player's popularity is not high enough, they may hold a Durbar festival in an attempt to impress the local leaders. If diplomacy fails, the player has the option to invade any territory by force. Soldiers can be hired through payments of gold; however, if the player does not have a sufficient amount of gold {{at the end of the}} turn, a rebellion may start. Rebellions will sometimes <b>initiate</b> lethal encounters with assassins, in which the player-character must defend themselves through sword combat. Additionally, the player can bring assassins to their side by successfully launching an attack on their temple. The game will end once either all of the territories are united, or if the player-character is assassinated.|$|E

40|$|Post-conflict {{affiliation}} between former opponents {{or between}} {{one of the}} former opponents and bystanders might have the function of conflict management, which reduces {{the costs associated with}} aggressions. One of the suggested functions of post-conflict affiliation is decreased renewed aggressions directed from aggressors to victims. However, the effect of post-conflict affiliation on renewed aggressions by victims has not been investigated. We examined whether post-conflict affiliations decreased the number of renewed aggressions <b>initiated</b> by winners or losers in captive bottlenose dolphins. Both winners and losers <b>initiated</b> renewed aggressions. However, these aggressions decreased after post-conflict affiliation between former opponents, <b>initiated</b> by bystanders to winners, <b>initiated</b> by losers to bystanders, and <b>initiated</b> by bystanders to losers. Post-conflict affiliation between former opponents is suggested to function as reconciliation. Post-conflict affiliation <b>initiated</b> by losers to bystanders is suggested to function as the protection of losers. Post-conflict affiliations <b>initiated</b> by bystanders to one of former opponents are suggested to function as both appeasement and protection of the opponent who affiliates with bystanders...|$|R
