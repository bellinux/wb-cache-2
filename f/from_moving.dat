5|$|While the {{division}} was conducting Operation Fliegenfänger, the Second Panzer Army was developing {{a plan to}} block a large Partisan force <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> from central Bosnia into western Serbia to reinforce the Partisans.

5|$|Early in {{the morning}} on 8 August the Georgian 4th Brigade from Vaziani Military Base {{advanced}} on the left flank of Tskhinvali; the 3rd Brigade advanced on the right flank. The aim of the flank operations was to advance northward after capturing key positions. The Georgian troops would take the Gupta bridge and the road to the Roki Tunnel, barring the Russian troops <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> southward.|$|E
5|$|Hostile native {{tribes and}} {{distance}} from nearby Spanish colonies discouraged settlers <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> to the area. It {{was one of}} New Spain's least populated provinces. In 1749, the Spanish peace treaty with the Lipan Apache angered many tribes, including the Comanche, Tonkawa, and Hasinai. The Comanche signed a treaty with Spain in 1785 and later helped to defeat the Lipan Apache and Karankawa tribes. With more numerous missions being established, priests led a peaceful conversion of most tribes. By {{the end of the}} 18th century only a few nomadic tribes had not converted to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Imaging techniques, such as x-ray, {{fluoroscopy}} and ultrasound {{are typically}} {{used to help}} guide {{the placement of the}} applicators to their correct positions and to further refine the treatment plan. CAT scans and MRI can also be used. Once the applicators are inserted, they are held in place against the skin using sutures or adhesive tape to prevent them <b>from</b> <b>moving.</b> Once the applicators are confirmed as being in the correct position, further imaging can be performed to guide detailed treatment planning.|$|E
5|$|Koniecpolski led {{a spring}} 1627 {{military}} campaign, {{trying to keep}} the Swedish army in the Duchy of Prussia <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> toward Danzig, while also intending to block their reinforcements arriving from the Holy Roman Empire. Moving quickly the Hetman recovered Puck, and then destroyed at the Battle of Czarne (Hammerstein) the forces intended for Gustavus. The Swedes themselves Koniecpolski's forces kept near Tczew, shielding the access to Danzig and preventing Gustavus Adolphus from reaching his main objective. At the Battle of Oliva the Polish ships defeated a Swedish naval squadron.|$|E
5|$|Ted {{tells the}} story of John Bennett (Mark Wahlberg) and his talking teddy bear (MacFarlane) who keeps John and his girlfriend Lori Collins (Mila Kunis) <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> on with their lives. The film {{received}} generally favorable reviews from both critics and audiences, and was a box office success, opening with the highest weekend gross of all time for an original R-rated comedy. Internationally, the movie is currently the highest-grossing original R-rated comedy of all time, beating The Hangover. A sequel, Ted 2, was released on June 26, 2015.|$|E

5|$|Though {{concentrated}} in London, the outbreak affected {{other areas of}} the country as well. Perhaps the most famous example was the village of Eyam in Derbyshire. The plague allegedly arrived with a merchant carrying a parcel of cloth sent from London, although this is a disputed point. The villagers imposed a quarantine on themselves to stop the further spread of the disease. This prevented the disease <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> into surrounding areas but the cost to the village was the death of around 80% of its inhabitants over a period of fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|To provide {{realistic}} bodies while {{preventing the}} corpses <b>from</b> <b>moving,</b> {{after a lengthy}} casting process the crew chose extras who could lie as still as possible. For the bath house owner Tsuyako Yamashita, this was not possible owing {{to the need to}} see her alive first, and a search for a body double was unfruitful. Ultimately, the crew used digital effects to transplant a still image of the actor during the character's funeral scene, allowing for a realistic effect.|$|E
5|$|Although he {{had been}} hailed as a hero, first for saving the Colonels <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> to Cincinnati and then for {{bringing}} a championship to Louisville, Brown came under intense public criticism following the Colonels' championship season for selling the rights to center Dan Issel to the Baltimore Claws in a cost-saving move. He frequently clashed with coach Hubie Brown during the 1975–76 season, {{and at the end}} of the year, he accepted $3 million to fold the team during the 1976 ABA–NBA merger rather than paying $3 million for the team to join the National Basketball Association (NBA).|$|E

5|$|By {{the morning}} of October29, a {{tropical}} wave, tracking towards the west, began {{to interact with the}} depression and leading to forecasters discussing a possible merger of the two systems. An upper-level anticyclone over the eastern Caribbean produced significant wind shear over the depression, preventing the center <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> under the deep convection. However, a large convective banding feature developed {{to the north of the}} system. Several hours later, hurricane hunters flew through the storm and recorded surface winds of 40mph (65km/h) and a barometric pressure of 999mbar (hPa; 29.5inHg), leading to the upgrade of the depression to a tropical storm. At this time, the storm received the name Katrina and peaked in intensity. By 0000UTC on October30, the center of Katrina made landfall near Puerto Cabezas, Nicaragua at peak intensity. Within three hours, the storm weakened to a depression due to interaction with the mountains of Nicaragua and convection was limited to a small area on the western side of the center of circulation.|$|E
5|$|During the {{operations}} {{along the south}} coast of New Britain the AIB officers sought to discourage the Japanese <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> west of the Wide Bay area by circulating rumours among the local population that a large Australian base had been established at Jacquinot Bay. In reality no such base existed at this time. The AIB force continued to make guerilla attacks on Japanese positions until early October, when it was ordered to cease offensive operations and concentrate on intelligence gathering ahead of the landing of Australian infantry and support units at Jacquinot Bay. The AIB's operations from June to October were assisted by occasional air attacks and naval bombardments conducted by elements of the Allied air forces and navies.|$|E
5|$|Fighting at the Notch {{continued}} through the afternoon, but, the attack still unsuccessful, the North Korean troops withdrew suddenly in the mid-afternoon, allowing American forces to recover most of the casualties and vehicles from the Notch. In the meantime, they set up roadblocks to prevent further North Korean attacks <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> down the road. North Korean forces disengaged from the fight without attempting to flank the Americans, and by nightfall {{they were out of}} the region. In the meantime, the 27th Infantry Regiment surprised a large column of North Korean forces advancing on the south road and captured many trucks of supplies. During the North Koreans' retreat from the two roads, US Air Force planes mounted an airstrike against the North Koreans and inflicted heavy casualties.|$|E

5|$|In August Belgrano again took {{command of}} the Army of the North, but with very limited people and resources. He was ordered to avoid trying to advance against the royalists in the north, and was {{to stay in a}} {{defensive}} state at Tucumán. With Güemes in Salta, his task was to prevent the Royalists <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> to the south. The Supreme Director Pueyrredón was supporting an alternative plan designed by José de San Martín: create the Army of the Andes at Cuyo and, after making the Crossing of the Andes, defeat the royalists in Chile, get control of the Chilean navy, and attack the royalist stronghold of Lima with it.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Black Lives Matter was {{selected}} by Pride Toronto as the honoured group in that year's Pride parade, during which they staged a sit-in to block the parade <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> forward for approximately half an hour. They issued a number of demands for Pride to adjust its relationship with LGBTQ people of colour, including stable funding and a suitable venue for the established Blockrama event, improved diversity in the organization's staff and volunteer base, and most famously that Toronto Police officers be banned from marching in the parade in uniform. Pride executive director Mathieu Chantelois signed BLM's statement of demand, but later asserted that he had signed it only to end the sit-in and get the parade moving, and had not agreed to honour the demands.|$|E
5|$|In nature, sixteen {{repositories}} {{were discovered}} at the Oklo mine in Gabon where natural nuclear fission reactions took place 1.7 billion years ago. The fission products in these natural formations {{were found to}} have moved less than 10ft (3 m) over this period, though the lack of movement may be due more to retention in the uraninite structure than to insolubility and sorption <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> ground water; uraninite crystals are better preserved here than those in spent fuel rods because of a less complete nuclear reaction, so that reaction products would be less accessible to groundwater attack.|$|E

5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1633, Commonwealth forces retook Dorogobuzh, an {{important}} Russian supply point after its capture the year before. This setback wrecked Russian plans to send reinforcements to Shein's army, although in any event the Russians did not begin to gather a 5,000-strong army for that purpose until January 1634. Also that autumn, Grand Crown Hetman Stanisław Koniecpolski defeated an Ottoman incursion {{in the south of}} the Commonwealth, freeing his force to lay siege to the Russian town of Sevsk; although Koniecpolski failed to take the fortress, he tied down large Russian forces, preventing them <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> north towards Smolensk.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Button set the quickest lap of the day, a 1:28.280, which was nearly one {{tenth of a}} second quicker than Webber. Vettel was third fastest followed by Hamilton in fourth. Alonso was fifth. Both Mercedes cars were slower in the session with Rosberg sixth and Schumacher seventh. Kubica, Petrov and Massa followed in the top ten. Webber stopped outside the exit of turn two with an engine failure and engaged in an argument with marshals on preventing the car <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> backwards. In the final practice session, Vettel was fastest {{with a time of}} 1:27.086. This made him three tenths of a second faster than Rosberg in second place. Hamilton set the third quickest lap despite spinning sideways into the turn eight gravel trap. He was ahead of Webber who was afflicted with a throttle problem, Kubica and Alonso. Schumacher, Button, Massa and Petrov completed the top ten ahead of qualifying.|$|E
5|$|Jourdan's {{orders were}} to take the army into Germany and secure {{strategic}} positions, particularly on the roads through Stockach and Schaffhausen, at the western-most border of Lake Constance. Similarly, as commander of the Army of Helvetia, André Masséna would acquire strategic positions in Switzerland, in particular the St. Gotthard Pass, the passes above Feldkirch, particularly Maienfeld (St. Luciensteig), and hold the central plateau in and around Zürich and Winterthur. These positions would prevent the Allies of the Second Coalition <b>from</b> <b>moving</b> troops {{back and forth between}} the northern Italian and German theaters, and insure French access to these strategic passes. Ultimately, this positioning would allow the French to control all western roads leading to and from Vienna. Finally, to complete Vienna's isolation, the army of Mayence would sweep through the north, blocking further access to and from Vienna from any of the northern Provinces, or from Britain.|$|E
