50|$|Hampshire's geology broadly {{comprises}} a gently folded {{succession of}} sedimentary rocks {{dating from the}} Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods. The lower (early) Cretaceous rocks are sandstones and mudstones whilst those of the upper (late) Cretaceous are the various formations which comprise the Chalk Group and give rise to the county's downlands. Overlying these rocks are the less consolidated Palaeogene clays, sands, <b>gravels</b> <b>and</b> <b>silts</b> of the Lambeth, Thames and Bracklesham Groups which characterise the Hampshire Basin.|$|R
50|$|Oodaaq or Oodap Qeqert is {{a bank of}} <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> {{northeast}} of Greenland that has been considered {{by some to be}} the most northerly point of land on earth. It was most likely created by the impact of an iceberg in shallow sea.|$|E
50|$|Generally, {{near surface}} geology {{of the valley}} {{consists}} of fluvial and glaciofluvial deposits of sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> units {{in the bottom of}} the valley. The valley sideslopes are made up of varying layers of colluvium and/or till moraines overlying bedrock. In some areas, the bedrock is exposed on the valley walls.|$|E
5000|$|Soils {{comprising}} the streambed of {{upper and lower}} reaches are classified as the riverwash series in the U.S. Soil Conservation Service Classification System. These materials according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, consist of very recent deposition of <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> alluvium along streams.

50|$|Exposed, within channel, fluvially {{deposited}} sediments (<b>gravels,</b> sands <b>and</b> <b>silts)</b> {{that lack}} continuous vegetation cover, whose vertical distribution lies between {{the levels of}} bankfull and the typical baseflow of the river.|$|R
50|$|The geology of Husborne Crawley {{is made up}} of greensand sandstone, {{although}} there are areas of mudstone layered within the sandstone {{which is part of the}} Oxford Clay Formation. The soil is therefore mostly sandy and partially clay, with some smaller areas of mixed soil including; sand, alluvium, <b>gravel,</b> clay <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b>|$|R
50|$|The site exposes {{a mixture}} of <b>gravels,</b> sands <b>and</b> <b>silts</b> which make up the Campden Tunnel Drift (Pleistocene period).

50|$|The Hanau-Seligenstadt Basin is {{separated}} from the Upper Rhine Graben to the west by a horst block. The Spessart mountains form its eastern margin. To the south it is bounded by the Odenwald mountains. Towards the north the graben margins converge. The basin sediments rest {{on top of the}} Variscan basement and Permian to Triassic rocks. Oligocene to Quaternary basin sediments reach more than 280 m in thickness. Marine, limnic and finally terrestrial clays, marls, limestones and sands with interbedded basalt layers dominate within the Oligocene and Miocene. The Pliocene and Quaternary river deposits consist of sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt,</b> in Pliocene also lignite. The recent landscape is formed by river terraces.|$|E
50|$|In the {{vicinity}} where the three ice lobes began to retreat, sits the recharge areas that allow surface water to enter {{back into the}} ground source. The speed of absorption depends on the density of aquifers and aquitards. Aquifers {{are made up of}} sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> where the water filters down relatively quickly. The shallow aquifers feed area bodies of water such as creeks and streams while the deeper aquifers feed down to replenish the ground water. The aquitards are the protective layers of clay that slowly filters the water and act to protect the main source from contamination. Left on its own, it is a naturally renewable way to gather fresh drinking water.|$|E
50|$|A {{key issue}} that AAPA is {{focusing}} on is the reorganization of the Harbor Maintenance Trust Fund (HMTF). AAPA hopes that the fund can be applied {{in a way that}} fully benefits ports and their surrounding communities. Since the creation of the fund in 1986, HMTF tax revenue has been used by the government to fund projects unrelated to port development. AAPA believes that the funding should go directly to ports in order to complete maintenance dredging. Regular maintenance dredging is crucial to most navigable waterways, harbors, and ports. Each year, several hundred feet of sand, <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> must be removed from waterways and harbors to maintain navigability—enough for a four-lane highway four feet deep stretching between New York City and Los Angeles, California, according to the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.|$|E
50|$|The plain {{was formed}} {{over the last}} 250,000 years from {{sediment}} deposited by the Tutaekuri, Ngaruroro and Tukituki Rivers and from coastal marine deposits. It consists of layers of <b>gravel,</b> sand <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> Permeable <b>gravel</b> beds form aquifers and the artesian groundwater provides 85% of the requirements for public water supply, irrigation and industrial use on the Heretaunga Plains and adjacent areas.|$|R
5000|$|Up to 30 feet of fluvial {{deposits}} of unconsolidated <b>gravel,</b> sand, <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> mapped as terrace deposition by the 1987 Texas Atlas of Geology.

50|$|From the Triassic {{until the}} early Paleogene the later Hanau-Seligenstadt Basin was a non-depositional region. Subsidence started latest during the Oligocene (Rupelian) about 30 million years ago during the {{evolution}} of the Upper Rhine Graben. The Upper Rhine Graben Sea and Upper Rhine Graben Lake also covered the Hanau-Seligenstadt Basin. Debris from the local highlands caused silting up and development of a river plain during the Miocene. About 15 million years ago during the Langhian volcanoes poured basaltic lava flows over parts of the area. Still during the Langhian, rivers started to erode their former sediments. In the Pliocene about 5 million years ago the Lower Main river and its tributaries recomenced to deposit sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> In lakes and swamps also clay layers and lignite developed. The still relatively short river Main tapped the Upper Main in the early Quaternary. The resulting large river transported lots of sand and gravel into the Hanau-Seligenstadt Basin. During the Middle Pleistocene rivers started once again to incise into their former sediments. The individual stages of the incision history are preserved as river terraces.|$|E
50|$|The {{formation}} of Kaitorete Barrier {{began at the}} end of the Last Glacial Maximum 20,000 years ago valley glaciers advanced in Canterbury and subsequent glacial outwash rivers delivered vast quantities of sand, <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> to the coast. Sea level in Canterbury was 130 meters lower than the present day due to glaciation and the coast was as far as 50 km east of its present-day position, meaning the Canterbury plains were double their present width. Subsequent rapid sea-level rise then drowned what is now the continental shelf, causing rapid westward migration of the coast. 10,000 years ago the Canterbury coast was approaching the area presently occupied by Lake Ellesmere / Te Waihora. The coast consisted then, as it does now of the unconsolidated sands and gravels of the fans of major rivers in the area such as the Rakaia and Waimakariri. The Canterbury Bight was exposed to powerful southerly waves. The combination of weakly resistant unconsolidated sands and gravels and high energy wave action caused rapid coastal erosion and strong net northward transport of the resulting load of sands and gravels fed to the shore.|$|E
50|$|The {{surficial}} geology {{near the}} mouth of Black Ash Creek mainly consists of alluvium, which contains stratified <b>gravel,</b> sand, <b>and</b> <b>silt,</b> along with some boulders. A patch of Wisconsinan Outwash is also present nearby. However, the majority of the watershed has surficial geology featuring a glacial or resedimented till known as Wisconsinan Till. There are also a few scattered patches of bedrock consisting of sandstone and shale.|$|R
50|$|The {{district}} {{is rich in}} limestone, salika sand, <b>gravels,</b> <b>silt,</b> <b>and</b> marble. These minerals are found in Taluka Thano Bula Khan and Sehwan. Coal is obtained from Lakhra Taluka Manjhand.|$|R
50|$|The {{central part}} of the basin {{continued}} to experience sediment deposition through the Pleistocene from flooding and erosional debris from the surrounding mountains and Puente Hills. This infill was responsible for the final retreat of the shoreline from the basin. Deposition in the Holocene is characterized by non marine <b>gravel,</b> sand <b>and</b> <b>silt.</b> This phase also includes the late stage compressional deformation responsible for the formation of the hydrocarbon traps.|$|R
5000|$|The first cutting, {{excavated}} {{in early}} 1989, {{was only a}} test-hole, intended to gain a preliminary understanding of the deposits and their contents and to establish an initial radiocarbon chronology”. [...] The determination of where to do the first cutting {{was based on the}} assumption that the deposits that were shallower than 3 m but deeper than 0.8 m would lead to the finding of natural deposits. [...] In Cutting I the deposits excavated were in an irregular series of units, which contained ashy earth in the higher levels and sand, <b>gravel,</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> towards the bottom levels. [...] There were fragments of wood charcoal as well as sherds of pottery. [...] In addition to the ecofacts, cultural remains that were uncovered in Cutting I were pieces of smoking pipes, disc beads of freshwater shell that were infrequently scattered, as well as two shell artifacts which consisted of a valve from the freshwater bivalve Mutela emini. [...] There was also animal bones that were discovered at the deposit. With all of this being tied together with the other evidence found, indicated domestic activities as a major factor in their formation.|$|E
5000|$|After a flood covered {{fields in}} <b>gravel</b> <b>and</b> <b>silt</b> {{in the small}} village of Ruidoso Downs, an {{informal}} race track {{was built on the}} fields in the 1940s. Bets varied from as [...] "little as a bag of oats or $10,000 to $50,000 was being bet." [...] A rodeo stand was moved from the village of Capitan, New Mexico to the field in 1945. [...] Arizona investor Eugene Hensley bought the racetrack in 1953, becoming its general manager. Over the next decade the facility would undergo a number of expansions, and around 1957, the All American Futurity was created by Hensley, Carl Mercer, and cowboy musician Ray Reed. Held at the racetrack on Labor Day starting in 1959, they added The Rainbow Futurity in 1964. In 1988 the majority of Ruidoso Downs Race Track was purchased by R.D. Hubbard. Though the track had fallen into disrepair, within a year Hubbard and a business partner invested several million dollars into improving the track. 1989 also the addition of simulcast racing and wagering, while Hubbard bought out Allred in 1991. Soon a sales pavilion and sports theatre were constructed, which is where the Ruidoso Select Yearling Sale is held. The facilities have also housed camel and ostrich races, as well as concerts by artists such as Toby Keith and Emilio Navaira. An adjacent casino was opened by the Hubbards in 1999. The 1937 Kentucky Derby trophy won by War Admiral is typically kept on display at Ruidoso Downs.|$|E
