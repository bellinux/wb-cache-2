The upper deck had twenty-four 60-pounder guns and two long 36-pounder chase guns. Two 3-pood shell guns were mounted fore and aft on revolving platforms. In 1862 her armament was revised and two 60-pounder and the two long 36-pounder guns on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck were removed. Four years later, it was rearranged with two 60-pounders moved from <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck to the lower deck and two long 36-pounders moved from the lower deck to the upper deck.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} she was {{decommissioned}} in 1969, Tiptoe was the last active T-class submarine in the Royal Navy. As she arrived at Spithead for decommissioning on 29 August 1969, a 13-year-old ballet dancer named Judy Wright danced on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck. She was sold in 1971 and scrapped at Portsmouth in 1975. Her anchor was saved, and was mounted on stone in 1979 in Blyth, Northumberland. The town was used as a training base for submarines during both World Wars.|$|E

50|$|Since 1991 the Grand Traverse Regional Land Conservancy had {{maintained}} a nature preserve along <b>Upper</b> <b>Herring</b> Lake (the <b>Upper</b> <b>Herring</b> Nature Preserve). Just {{north of the}} township's southern border is Inspiration Point, a high headland overlooking Lake Michigan where a platform has been built atop the bluff. The point is a popular lookout and is a prominent stop along the scenic route of Highway 22. The Conservancy also maintains popular and scenic preserves at Green Point Dunes and Arcadia Dunes: The C.S. Mott Nature Preserve (partially within the township).|$|R
5|$|In January 2003, van Grunsven {{sustained}} a fracture of a bone in <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> leg {{in a fall}} from a horse in training, and required surgery. A metal plate was embedded in her leg to immobilize the bone during the healing process, and van Grunsven recovered, winning the 2003 Dutch Dressage Championships in June.

5|$|Margaret Roberts {{attended}} Huntingtower Road Primary School and won {{a scholarship}} to Kesteven and Grantham Girls' School. Her school reports showed hard work and continual improvement; her extracurricular activities included the piano, field hockey, poetry recitals, swimming and walking. She was head girl in 1942–43. In <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> sixth year she applied for a scholarship to study chemistry at Somerville College, Oxford, a women's college at the time, but she was initially rejected and was offered a place only after another candidate withdrew.|$|E
5|$|The woman {{wears an}} elegant low-cut black dress with dark bands of fur {{at the neck}} and wrist. Her clothes are of the then-fashionable Burgundian style, which emphasises the tall and thin {{aesthetic}} of the Gothic ideal. Her dress is buckled by a bright red sash pulled in below her breasts. The buff-coloured hennin headdress is draped with a large transparent veil, which spills over her shoulders, reaching <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> arms. Van der Weyden's attention {{to the structure of}} the clothing—the careful detailing of the pins pushed into the veil to fix its position—is typical for the artist.|$|E

5|$|Warrior {{was heavily}} {{damaged by the}} German shells, which caused large fires and heavy flooding, {{although}} the engine room crew - of whom only three survived - kept the engines running for long enough {{to allow her to}} withdraw to the west. She was taken in tow by the seaplane tender HMS Engadine who took off her surviving crew of 743. She was abandoned in a rising sea at 8:25a.m. on 1 June when <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck was only 4feet (1.2m) above the water, and subsequently foundered.|$|E
5|$|As Connecticut {{was only}} 55% {{complete}} {{when she was}} launched, missing most of <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> works, protection, machinery and armament, {{it was two years}} before Connecticut was commissioned on 29 September 1906. Captain William Swift was the first captain of the new battleship. Connecticut sailed out of New York {{for the first time on}} 15 December 1906, becoming the first ship in the US Navy to ever go to sea without a sea trial. She first journeyed south to the Virginia Capes, where she conducted a variety of training exercises; this was followed by a shakedown cruise and battle practice off Cuba and Puerto Rico. During the cruise, she participated in a search for the missing steamer Ponce.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{following}} her repairs she ran aground outside Vladivostok on 13 October {{and was not}} ready for sea until February 1905. The Russians took this opportunity to reinforce her armament with six more 6-inch guns mounted on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck, protected by lightly armoured casemates. Her armament was rearranged as well with her foremost six-inch guns moved from their casemates to the forecastle and the rearmost six-inch guns moved forward. Room for these changes was made by removing many of her lighter guns; she retained only nineteen 75mm and two 37mm guns. She also received several Barr and Stroud rangefinders at this time. While testing her new Telefunken radio equipment on 24 May she struck a mine near her forward boiler room. She was {{able to return to}} Vladivostok for repairs, but took no further part in the war.|$|E

5|$|Åkerman {{was raised}} a Buddhist, which {{inspired}} the lotus flower tattoo on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> back.

The two met in 2003 when Åkerman was the lead singer for The Petalstones, for which Zincone served as the drummer. After band practices, they usually socialized, using a dictionary as he could not speak English. They eventually started dating and married at Grand Hotel Moon Valley in Sorrento, Italy on June 20, 2007. Every year, they used to spend their holidays in Naples, Zincone's native city. The couple had one son, Sebastian Zincone, born on April 16, 2013. On November 25, 2013, the couple announced that they were separating. Zincone filed for divorce on December 2, 2013.|$|E
5|$|From 16 to 20 February, Z34, Z38, T5, and T6 escorted the {{passenger}} liner Hamburg to Sassnitz. On 22 February she escorted the German steamer Deutschland to Sassnitz. On 18 and 19 February she, alongside German cruiser Admiral Scheer, destroyer Z43, and minelayers T28 and T35, bombarded Soviet 39th Army positions, near Peyse and Gross-Heydekrug, {{on the south}} coast of Samland. On 23 February she, Z43 and T28 bombarded these locations again. At one point during this, while between Königsberg and Fischhausen, she and T8 became icebound, and were freed by tugs. From 4 to 6 March she bombarded Soviet armour and positions near Wollin, before taking refugees from Pillau to Gotenhafen. On 7 March Z35, Z38, and T28 escorted the steamship Pretoria to Copenhagen. On 13 March, after returning to Gotenhafen, she bombarded Großendorf. For the rest of March, she was controlled by the German army, rather than the German navy. On 4 April <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck was damaged in an air raid. On 5 April she became involved in a battle off Oxhöfter Kämpe. On 9 April she escorted German cruisers Lützow and Prinz Eugen from the Bay of Danzig to Swinemünde. From 28 April to 4 May she helped defend the Dievenow channel of the Oder river.|$|E

25|$|Neptuno {{was built}} at the Royal Dockyard at Ferrol {{as one of the}} Montañes-class of 74- and 80-gun ships of the line, a design {{developed}} by Romero Landa and based on his earlier San Ildefonso class of 1785. Among her sisters were the Argonauta and Monarca, both of which fought alongside Neptuno at Trafalgar. She carried twenty-eight 24-pounder guns on her lower gundeck, thirty 18-pounders on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck, fourteen 8-pounders on her quarter deck and four 8-pounders on her forecastle. By 1805 she had been fitted with four 18 pounder carronades on her poop, while the 18 pounders on <b>her</b> <b>upper</b> deck had been replaced by 24 pounders. Overall work on the ships of the Montañes class was overseen by Julién de Retamosa, and Neptuno was launched at Ferrol in 1795.|$|E

Later analysis of isotopes in her bones lent further support to this geographic clue.|$|E
