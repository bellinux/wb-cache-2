That year he appeared in the D W Griffith film <b>Hearts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> World in an uncredited role. He sold short stories to several magazines to help his family financially. He also began writing plays, collaborating {{on the first two}} (Ida Collaborates (1917) and Women and Whisky (1918)) with his friend Esmé Wynne.

5|$|The Princess {{was married}} by proxy to PedroII in 1843. Her spouse's {{expectations}} {{had been raised}} when a portrait was presented that depicted Teresa Cristina as an idealized beauty, but he was displeased by his bride's plain looks upon their first meeting later that year. Despite a cold beginning, the couple's relationship improved as time passed, due primarily to Teresa Cristina's patience, kindness, generosity and simplicity. These traits also helped her win the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Brazilian people, and her distance from political controversies shielded her from criticism. She also sponsored archaeological studies in Italy and Italian immigration to Brazil.|$|E
5|$|The main plant foods {{gathered}} were walnuts, saguaro fruits, juniper berries, acorns, sunflower seeds, manzanita {{berries and}} apples, hackberries, the bulbs of the Quamash, and the greens of the Lamb's quarters, Scrophularia, and Lupinus plants. Agave {{was the most}} crucial harvest, {{as it was the}} only plant food available from late fall through early spring. The <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> plant were roasted in stone-lined pits, and could be stored for later use. Primary animals hunted were deer, rabbit, jackrabbit, quail, and woodrat. Fish and water-borne birds were eschewed by most Yavapai groups. Some groups of Tolkepaya began eating fish after contact with their Quechan neighbors.|$|E

It was only when Alan left with most of his force that Óláfr was able {{to regain control of}} the island. Rögnvaldr sailed from Galloway in the winter of the same year, landed on Mann, and burnt all the ships of Óláfr and his chiefs. The chronicle states that Rögnvaldr stayed at Ronaldsway for forty days; and that he won over the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> southern inhabitants of the island.

The chronicle claims that Rögnvaldr was treacherously killed by his own men, without the prior knowledge of Óláfr, and also notes that Óláfr never avenged his half-brother's death.|$|E

5|$|The series {{starts with}} Kingdom Hearts, where a 14-year-old boy named Sora is {{separated}} from his friends Riku and Kairi when their world, Destiny Islands, is invaded by creatures known as the Heartless. During the invasion, Sora obtains a weapon called the Keyblade {{that allows him to}} fight the Heartless. He soon arrives in another world, Traverse Town, where he meets Donald Duck and Goofy, two emissaries from Disney Castle sent to find the Keyblade wielder under orders from their missing king, Mickey Mouse. The three band together and travel to different Disney-themed worlds, sealing the <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> worlds to prevent more Heartless from devouring the hearts of those worlds as they search for their companions. Along the way, they encounter a group of Disney villains led by Maleficent, who are controlling the Heartless to capture seven maidens called the Princesses of Heart, and use their power to open the door to Kingdom Hearts, the heart of all worlds. Though they eventually defeat Maleficent, the three discover a sentient Heartless named Ansem to be the true orchestrator of the worlds' destruction. The three defeat Ansem and seal the door to Kingdom Hearts, but remain separated from Riku and King Mickey while Kairi remains home to await her friends' return.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} Greek {{thought about}} poetry considered the theogonies {{to be the}} prototypical poetic genre—the prototypical mythos—and imputed almost magical powers to it. Orpheus, the archetypal poet, also was the archetypal singer of theogonies, which he uses to calm seas and storms in Apollonius' Argonautica, and to move the stony <b>hearts</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> underworld gods in his descent to Hades. When Hermes invents the lyre in the Homeric Hymn to Hermes, {{the first thing he}} does is sing about the birth of the gods. Hesiod's Theogony is not only the fullest surviving account of the gods, but also the fullest surviving account of the archaic poet's function, with its long preliminary invocation to the Muses. Theogony also was the subject of many lost poems, including those attributed to Orpheus, Musaeus, Epimenides, Abaris, and other legendary seers, which were used in private ritual purifications and mystery-rites. There are indications that Plato was familiar with some version of the Orphic theogony. A silence would have been expected about religious rites and beliefs, however, and that nature of the culture would not have been reported by members of the society while the beliefs were held. After they ceased to become religious beliefs, few would have known the rites and rituals. Allusions often existed, however, to aspects that were quite public.|$|E
