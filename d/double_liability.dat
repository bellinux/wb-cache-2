50|$|Title III {{included}} 46 {{sections of}} technical amendments that clarified banking legislation. These included {{but were not}} limited to the rules of stock ownership, elimination of <b>double</b> <b>liability,</b> surplus requirements, rules for loans to executives, rules of branch banking, rules of securities transactions and the rights of shareholders.|$|E
5000|$|Double {{taxation}} is the levying of tax {{by two or}} more jurisdictions on {{the same}} declared income (in the case of income taxes), asset (in the case of capital taxes), or financial transaction (in the case of sales taxes). <b>Double</b> <b>liability</b> is mitigated {{in a number of}} ways, for example: ...|$|E
5000|$|Interpleader is {{also allowed}} by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure [...] Rule 22 is known as rule {{interpleader}}. Rule interpleader provides a remedy for any person who is, or may be exposed to <b>double</b> or multiple <b>liabilities.</b> The stakeholder may invoke Rule 22 as a plaintiff, or by counter-claiming in an action already started against him by one, or more claimants. There are specific differences between Statutory Interpleader, and Rule Interpleader: ...|$|R

Joinder for interpleader is proper even though:(A) {{the claims of}} the several claimants, or the titles on which their claims depend, lack a common origin or are adverse and independent rather than identical; or(B) the plaintiff denies liability {{in whole or in part}} to any or all of the claimants.(2) By a Defendant. A defendant exposed to similar liability may seek interpleader through a crossclaim or counterclaim.|$|R
60|$|And Augusta, as {{she gazed}} on the noble face, the ardent {{expression}} of sincerity and remorse, could not doubt {{that her husband}} was saved. But Edward's plan of reformation had one grand defect. It was merely modification and retrenchment, and not entire abandonment. He could not feel it necessary to cut himself off entirely from the scenes and associations where temptation had met him. He considered not that, when the temperate flow of the blood and the even balance of the nerves have once been destroyed, there is, ever after, a <b>double</b> and fourfold <b>liability,</b> which often makes a man the sport of the first untoward chance.|$|R

The firm had invested heavily in a Pittsburgh bank which failed after the Panic of 1873. Because of the <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> of stockholders (up to twice the amount of the investment), the business was ruined and his father lost everything, including his house.|$|E
50|$|Section 5 helps {{protect the}} {{promisor}} from <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> (having to pay {{two sets of}} damages for the same breach, one to the third party and one to the promisee) if the promisor breaches the contract. It does so in a very limited way, though - the promisor is only protected if he has first paid damages to the promisee, and the third party's claim comes after that. In addition the Act only limits damages paid in this situation, it does not eliminate them. If the promisee brings an action against the promisor and wins, any damages paid to the third party in a subsequent action must take the previous damages paid to the promisee into account.|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{an option}} theoretic model {{is applied to}} develop a Deposit Insurance Scheme under {{asymmetric}} information environment. By introducing <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> as an option into the deposit insurance scheme, our model solves the Deposit Insurer's adverse selection problem. With appropriately designed deposit insurance premia and <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> obligations, we demonstrate that separating equilibria exist. The introduction of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> into the current deposit insurance system adds additional cost to the system to make the insurance scheme more effective. Macey and Miller (1992) suggest that such <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> is a very useful tool for preventing the incentive problem typically created by current deposit insurance schemes. Based on Jackson (1993), Macey and Miller (1993) and Grossman (2002), no consensus exists to explain whether <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> can replace the current deposit insurance system. There are two companion issues that must be considered. The first is {{the preservation of the}} safety of the financial system. The second is the incentive created by current deposit insurance schemes for managers to take extra risk. This is an attempt to create a model in which both the deposit insurance premiums and <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> issues are integrated in a manner that preserves incentive compatibility, while embracing risk-sensitive deposit insurance policy. ...|$|E
40|$|In Flores v. Southern Peru Copper Corporation, the U. S. Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, re-examined its Alien Tort Claims Act (ATCA) {{jurisprudence}} {{and assumed}} that a private domestic company acting in its private capacity could be liable to Peruvian nationals under the ATCA {{for a wide}} range of torts under international law, including violations of rights to “life and health. ” Previous cases and other Circuits held that only a handful of egregious crimes, when committed by a private individual or corporation, can justify private liability under the ATCA. Rather than abiding by these interpretations, however, the court examined in depth the sufficiency of the Peruvians 2 ̆ 7 claims without addressing the threshold issue of private liability. Ultimately, the Flores court held that it lacked subject matter jurisdiction over the Peruvians 2 ̆ 7 environmental claims, styled as claims for life and health. Nevertheless, the court raised the prospect of wide-ranging ATCA liability by suggesting that if it had found sufficient consensus in “customary international law” regarding the illegality of Southern Peru Copper Corporation 2 ̆ 7 s intra-national pollution, the claims may have been granted subject matter jurisdiction. The court came to the proper conclusion in rejecting subject matter jurisdiction. However, it wrongly applied the holding in Filartiga v. Pena-Irala-which considered only state-sponsored activity-to claims against a private corporation acting in its private capacity. Whether this misplaced reliance on Filartiga and failure to set a threshold standard for private corporate liability was intentional or mistaken, it was a grave error, putting private corporations at risk for snowballing private corporate liability under the ATCA. The Flores court should have issued a more limited holding and re-emphasized that private, non-state-sponsored actions will only engender Filartiga-style ATCA analysis in a limited set of egregious circumstances. Instead, as this note will examine, the court opened the door for endless and unpredictable <b>liability,</b> <b>double</b> recovery, and forum-shopping that could eventually stifle U. S. multi-national corporation (“MNC”) investment and activity abroad, hamper the competitiveness of U. S. MNCs abroad, and cost such companies millions of dollars in extensive discovery and briefing on every claim brought in the Second Circuit. The ideal solution to the problem presented by the Flores decision would be for Congress or the Supreme Court to clarify all aspects of liability under the ATCA, particularly corporate liability. While the Supreme Court recently issued its long-awaited first decision addressing the scope of the ATCA, Sosa v. Alvarez-Machain, it specifically left open the corporate actor question under the ATCA. To respond to this confusion, and to redress cases such as Flores, Congress and the Circuits must set a standard which makes individual corporate liability a threshold question, as in the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s panel decision in Doe v. Unocal...|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the effects of}} the abolition of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> requirement imposed on bank shareholders in Canada on bank risk-taking and lending behavior. Under the <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> rule, the shareholders of a bank were liable up to twice the amount of their subscribed shares in the case of bankruptcy. With the establishment of the Bank of Canada in 1934, the <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> requirement became less stringent and depended on the pace of the redemption of notes in circulation issued by the individual chartered commercial banks. Using historical balance sheet and accounting data, we show that the abolition of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> was not accompanied by increased bank risk taking in Canada. Our findings are consistent with the literature that focuses on uniform regulations and nationwide branching as key financial stability elements in Canada...|$|E

40|$|For three {{quarters}} of a century-between, roughly, the Civil War and the Great Depression-shareholders in American banks were responsible not only for their investments, but also for a portion of the bank 2 ̆ 7 s debts after insolvency. If a bank failed, the receiver would determine the extent of the insolvency and then assess shareholders for an amount up to and including the par value of their stock. This system of 2 ̆ 2 <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> 2 ̆ 2 was actively and vigorously enforced throughout the period of its existence, generating an enormous volume of litigation, including nearly fifty decisions by the United States Supreme Court and hundreds more in the state courts and lower federal courts. The <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> of bank shareholders raises fundamental questions for corporate law and banking regulation...|$|E
40|$|In {{a recent}} article, we {{presented}} a historical {{analysis of the}} regime of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> for bank shareholders {{that existed in the}} United States between the Civil War and the Great Depression. Under this regime of <b>double</b> <b>liability,</b> if a bank failed, a receiver would be appointed {{to determine the extent to}} which the bank 2 ̆ 7 s liabilities exceeded its assets. Shareholders would then be required to pay an amount up to and including the par value of their stock to satisfy the outstanding claims. Under current law, the regime of limited liability that existed for about seventy-five years has now been replaced by a more traditional corporate law paradigm in which shareholders 2 ̆ 7 risks are capped at the amount of their initial capital investment. Moreover, the protections for depositors once provided by the regime of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> have now been replaced by a federally sponsored program of deposit insurance. In a new and more complete study of national bank receiverships during the 1930 - 34 period, Professor Howell Jackson examines data for 1, 595 national banks. Professor Jackson includes additional observations in his data set and extended the period of his inquiry concerning receiverships. While we stopped with receiverships that were completed by October 31, 1937, Professor Jackson uses receiverships that were completed as late as October 31, 1941. Thus, while Jackson 2 ̆ 7 s analysis covers the same 1930 - 34 period that we covered, his study includes receiverships that took far longer to complete than the receiverships we examined in our study...|$|E
40|$|We use a novel {{data set}} {{spanning}} 1820 - 1910 {{to examine the}} origins of bank supervision and assess factors leading {{to the creation of}} formal bank supervisory institutions across U. S. states. We show that it took more than a century for the widespread adoption of independent supervisory institutions tasked with maintaining the safety and soundness of banks. State legislatures initially pursued cheaper regulatory alternatives, such as <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> laws; however, banking distress at the state level as well as the structural shift from note-issuing to deposit-taking commercial banks propelled policymakers to adopt costly and permanent supervisory institutions. ...|$|E
40|$|Conventional wisdom {{holds that}} the {{enactment}} of federal deposit insurance helped small rural banks {{at the expense of}} large urban institutions. This paper uses asymmetric information, agency-cost paradigms from corporate finance theory and data on bank stock prices to show how deposit insurance could and did help stockholders of large banks. The broadening stockholder distribution of large banks during the stock market bubble of the late 1920 s undermined the efficiency of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> provisions in controlling incentive conflict among large bank stakeholders. Federal deposit insurance restored depositor confidence by asking government officials to take over and bond the task of monitoring managerial performance and solvency at U. S. banks. ...|$|E
40|$|Bank owner {{contingent}} liability has been {{important in the}} development of many industrial countries. Unlimited liability on bank owners was an important element in the success of Scottish banking, which led Scotland to be free of the banking and monetary upheavals that occurred in Britain and the United States. The unlimited liability provision effectively minimized the losses suffered by bank noteholders and other creditors. Three factors were vital to the success of unlimited liability in Scotland: 1) the identities of bank owners were made publicly available, and their level of wealth could be verified; 2) under Scottish bankruptcy law, owner liability extended to both personal and inheritable wealth; and 3) the transfer of ownership claims in private and provincial banks required that ownership first be dissolved before a new bank could be formed. A {{contingent liability}} system has three advantages: 1) because <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> imposes postclosure losses on bank stockholders, it increases incentives for banks to hold capital and decreases moral hazard incentives; 2) a contingent liability system can ameliorate asymmetric information problems between bank creditors and owners; and 3) contingent liability can lead to more efficient capital formation if potential capital sources are predominantly in the form of fixed wealth, as is true in many developing countries. But a free-rider problem arises when less-wealthy stockholders rely on the monitoring efforts of wealthier stockholders, who have more incentive to monitor. And in a free and anonymous exchange market, investors with less personal fixed wealth will outbid those with greater wealth, so the value of <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> could collapse overtime.

40|$|Although bank {{supervision}} under the National Banking System exercised a light hand and panics were frequent, depositor losses were minimal. <b>Double</b> <b>liability</b> induced shareholders to carefully monitor bank managers and voluntarily liquidate banks early if {{they appeared to}} be in trouble. Inducing more disclosure, marking assets to market, and ensuring prompt closure of insolvent national banks, the Comptroller of the Currency reinforced market discipline. The arrival of the Federal Reserve weakened this regime. Monetary policy decisions conflicted with the goal of financial stability and created moral hazard. The appearance of the Fed as an additional supervisor led to more “competition in laxity” among regulators and “regulatory arbitrage” by banks. When the Great Depression hit, policy-induced deflation and asset price volatility were misdiagnosed as failures of competition and market valuation. In response, the New Deal shifted to a regime of discretion-based supervision with forbearance. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of three essays. The first essay (thesis chapter two) investigates the 29 bank combinations between 1900 and 1931 that reduced the Canadian banking sector from 35 to 11 banks. The concentration of the Canadian banking industry is examined using the four-firm and the Hirshman-Herfindahl (HHI) indexes using monthly data on bank branches per institution and region, and nationally. Most of the substantial increase and variation in bank concentration in the national and regional HHIs based on bank branches are explained by merger activity. The second essay (thesis chapter three) examines the merger of La Banque Nationale (LBN) with La Banque d'Hochelaga (LBdH). This merger was facilitated by a generous financial arrangement with the Quebec government, and continuing federal government loans. As Bennett and Loucks (1996) conclude, political connections ensured {{a long period of}} forbearance for LBN and facilitated LBN's rescue. Accounting and reporting window dressing also assisted the rescue of the economically insolvent and too-important-to-fail LBN. These findings support the conclusions of Kryzanowski and Roberts (1993, 1999) that forbearance and window dressing {{played an important role in}} preventing the failure of many Canadian banks during the 1920 s and 1930 s. The third essay (thesis chapter four) examines the failure costs of the 29 Canadian bank failures since Confederation for various stakeholder groups over four sub periods with different safety net regimes. The determinants (including safety net regime) of four total loss measurement metrics are estimated. With the introduction of explicit deposit insurance and the abolition of <b>double</b> <b>liability,</b> the proportion of total losses directly borne by banks and the government increased significantly, and the proportion borne directly by shareholders of the failed bank decreased significantly. This finding supports the conclusion of Kane (1985) that deposit insurance creates moral hazard among bank stakeholders. These results also extend the work of Kryzanowski and Roberts (1993, 1998, 1999) by suggesting that forbearance heightened bank-specific losses and lessened bank industry-specific losses during the two most recent sub periods due to careful monitoring and control of bank failure and closure by the government and the CBA (Canadian Bankers Association...|$|E
40|$|Among {{the lessons}} {{financial}} history offers: Macroeconomic stability - low inflation and sound public finance - {{is important for}} creating the right incentives for banks and for facilitating the development of securities markets. High inflation and large fiscal deficits distort economic behavior in favor of short-term speculative projects conducive to sustainable economic development. Central bank independence may contribute to economic stability. One way to increase it is by lengthening the term of central bank governors. There must be incentives for bank owners to behave prudently - a requirement that they have capital commensurate with the risks they assume, for example. Unlimited liability and <b>double</b> <b>liability</b> limits may be less feasible now than in the past, but banks in developing countries that face higher risks should maintain higher capital ratios than banks in the more advanced OECD countries. Effective supervision is also essential. Banks run into solvency problems because they fail to diversify - often because of regulatory (especially geographic) restrictions, {{but also because of}} excessive connected lending or genuine mistakes. Regulators must ensure that banks diversify their risks, which means ending geographic or sectoral restrictions (including prohibitions against holding foreign assets) and restricting connected lending. Developing effective supervision (to ensure meaningful and effective compliance with prudential rules) is difficult and time-consuming but essential. The difficulty of supervising universal banks and financial conglomerates is an argument used against them in developing countries. But universal banks may generate efficiency gains as they overcome the problems of inadequate reliable public information on industrial and commercial companies. Holding small equity stakes and being involved in corporate governance may be productive. The risk of overlending to related firms is likely to be small when banks hold small stakes in industrial firms; it is high when firms control banks. Pension funds and other institutional investors have grown in importance in many countries over the past thirty years or so, because of longer life spans and longer retirement. These funds started as labor market institutions and personnel management tools, but have become important financial intermediaries. Pension funds offer developing countries an alternative both for restructuring their public finances and for promoting their capital markets. Pension funds can play the role that thrift deposit institutions - such as savings banks, credit cooperatives, and building societies - played in developed countries in the nineteenth century. But thrift institutions can still contribute to financial and economic development by promoting thrift and facilitating credit rural areas and among low-income groups. They will contribute more if they involve a three tier structure that combines the benefits of local involvement and monitoring with centralized auditing and supervision.
