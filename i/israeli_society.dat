It consists of twelve family houses, to accommodate up to 120 children. There is also an SOS Youth Facility to accommodate 12 to 14 youths from the SOS Children's Village. In January 2005, an SOS Social Centre was opened at Arad. It runs a day-care center and various community outreach programmes to support socially weak families. Until fall 2008, the World Union of Jewish Students (WUJS), funded by Jews from New Jersey, had an institute in Arad which allowed post-college young Jews {{from around the world to}} study <b>Israeli</b> <b>society</b> and the Hebrew language. When WUJS's ownership changed, the institute was moved to the center of the country.|$|E
25|$|The kibbutzim had a rural {{patterns}} of settlements, while {{over the years}} the <b>Israeli</b> <b>society</b> began adopting urban {{patterns of}} settlements. The lack of match between the patterns of the kibbutz society and the majority of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>society,</b> appealed the strong linkage between the kibbutzim with the entire <b>Israeli</b> <b>society,</b> a principle that did not allow the continuation of the collaborative model (because of the internal weakening and the loss of the all-Israeli legitimacy).|$|E

25|$|When {{the kibbutz}} was {{perceived}} as an initiator for values and national objectives, {{it was very much}} appreciated in the <b>Israeli</b> <b>society</b> and it was easier for the members to identify themselves with the kibbutz, its function and its significance. With the decrease of its appreciation and the minimizing of the social significances in the <b>Israeli</b> <b>society,</b> the kibbutz identity weakened.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{to other}} groups of {{immigrant}} Jews who made aliyah to Israel, the Ethiopian Jews have faced obstacles in their integration to <b>Israeli</b> <b>society.</b> Initially the main challenges of the Ethiopian Jewish community in Israel were {{due in part to}} communication difficulties (most of the population could not read or write in Hebrew, and much of the veteran population could not hold a simple conversation in the Hebrew language), discrimination in certain areas of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>society,</b> manifestations of racism from some parts of the <b>Israeli</b> <b>society.</b> Unlike Russian immigrants, many of whom arrive with job skills, Ethiopians came from a subsistence economy and were ill-prepared to work in an industrialized society.|$|E

25|$|Israeli culture views higher {{education}} {{as the key}} to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in <b>Israeli</b> <b>society.</b> For millennia medieval European antisemitism often forbade the Jews from owning land and farming, which limited their career choices for making a decent living. This forced many Jews to place a much higher premium on education allowing them to seek alternative career options that involved entrepreneurial and white-collar professional pursuits such as merchant trading, science, medicine, law, accountancy, and moneylending as these professions required higher levels of verbal, mathematical, and scientific literacy. The emphasis of education within <b>Israeli</b> <b>society</b> has its modern roots at least since the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement {{all the way to the}} roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nation's high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly <b>Israeli</b> <b>society</b> values {{higher education}}.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} of conflict transformations, especially concerning national conflicts in a colonial context, emphasizes as {{a precondition for}} reconciliation "recognition of equal worth," which in turn requires self-transformation, separation, and taking responsibility for past injustices. {{this article examines the}} writings and speeches of Israeli leaders during the Oslo process through this lens.
