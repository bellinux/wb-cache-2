5|$|The last fort to be {{built in}} Malta was Fort Campbell, which was built near Mellieħa between late 1937 and 1938. The design of the fort <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the earlier fortifications in Malta as it was {{designed}} to counter the new threat of aerial bombardment. It had an irregular plan and its perimeter was guarded by machine gun posts and a few rifle loopholes. The buildings inside were scattered so as not to create a concentration of buildings. The fort still exists, although it is largely in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Two {{music videos}} {{were made for}} the song; the first one for the ballad version, {{and the other for}} the English version. The ballad version was {{directed}} by Felipe Niño. In the video, the group is shown performing the song along with an orchestra behind them. It is filmed on a stage where shows López singing his verses, while the others members of the group, follow up with the chorus. At the end of the video the people of the orchestra starts to applaud when the group ends to sing. In the English version of the video, the plot <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different.</b> The video starts in a cloudy afternoon after a storm, where the group is situated in a white room. It shows López singing in a ladder when it later starts to fill with water. At {{the last part of the}} video, it shows Son by Four singing out of the house after the storm has ended.|$|E
5|$|Two {{recently}} designed national flags {{resemble the}} Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag {{that had a}} green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The current flag, adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes the blood that was shed to create their country. The island nation of Palau uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different.</b> While the Government of Palau does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer Palau from 1914 until 1944. The flag of Palau is an off-centered golden-yellow full moon on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau's transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.|$|E

25|$|In {{the field}} of system {{reliability}} orthogonal redundancy is that form of redundancy where the form of backup device or method <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the prone to error device or method.

25|$|In Brazil {{there was}} also a more {{powerful}} version called the XR-3, only available to run on alcohol.

25|$|THOV and JOSV also encode {{the protein}} M-long (ML), which {{counters}} the host's innate immunity, in particular by suppressing {{the production of}} interferon. This immune evasion {{is important for the}} virus to infect systemically in vertebrates, but is unnecessary in arthropods, which lack the interferon response. The mechanism of action of ML <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the equivalent protein in influenza viruses (NS1).|$|E
25|$|The {{alphabet}} {{is essentially}} an uncial form of the Greek alphabet, with a few additional letters to account for Gothic phonology: Latin F and G, a questionably Runic letter to distinguish the /w/ glide from vocalic /u/, and the letter ƕair to express the Gothic labiovelar. It <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the 'Gothic script' of the Middle Ages, a script used to write the Latin alphabet.|$|E

25|$|Even {{though the}} {{microscopic}} physics {{of these two}} systems <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different,</b> their critical exponents {{turn out to be}} the same. Moreover, one can calculate these exponents using the same statistical field theory. The key observation is that at a phase transition or critical point, fluctuations occur at all length scales, and thus one should look for a scale-invariant statistical field theory to describe the phenomena. In a sense, universality is the observation that there are relatively few such scale-invariant theories.|$|E
25|$|Hatha yoga can {{be carried}} out when the body is made fit for the purpose. The body should be {{cleansed}} first of impurities through sat sadhna, the six elementary practices of yoga. Hatha yoga <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from laya yoga. Hatha yoga can make the body strong, enabling it to survive for four hundred years or more, whereas laya yoga helps the aspirant to attain union with the supreme. If the body is not kept purified both externally and internally with hatha yoga, attempting laya yoga would yield no result.|$|E
25|$|Literature from North East India {{refers to}} {{literature}} of Languages of North East India, {{and also the}} body of work by English-language writers from this region. North-East India is an under-represented region in many ways. The troubled political climate, the beautiful landscape and the confluence of various ethnic groups perhaps {{have given rise to}} a body of writing that <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from Indian English Literature. North-East India was a colonial construct and continues to be one by virtue of having a historically difficult relationship with the Indian nation state.|$|E

25|$|Most often, a {{character}} {{will be used}} for both sound and meaning, and it is simply a matter of choosing the correct reading based on which word it represents. In other cases, {{a character}} is used only for sound (ateji). In this case, pronunciation is still based on a standard reading, or used only for meaning (broadly a form of ateji, narrowly jukujikun). Therefore, only the full compound—not the individual character—has a reading. There are also special cases where the reading <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different,</b> often based on an historical or traditional reading.|$|E
25|$|This is {{the most}} common open hole {{completion}} used today. It is basically the same described on the vertical open hole completion but on a horizontal well it enlarges significantly the contact with the reservoir, increasing the production or injection rates of your well. Sand control on a horizontal well <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from a vertical well. We can no longer rely on the gravity for the gravel placement. Most service companies uses an alpha and beta wave design to cover the total length of the horizontal well with gravel. It's known that very long wells (around 6000ft) were successfully gravel packed in many occasions, including deepwater reservoirs in Brazil.|$|E
25|$|A manga {{spin-off}} of {{the series}} supervised by Kazuki Takahashi and {{written and illustrated by}} Naoyuki Kageyama began serialization in V-Jump on December 17, 2005. The chapters have been collected and published in nine tankōbon volumes by Shueisha starting on November 2, 2006. The manga is licensed for English language release by Viz Media, which serialized the first 37 chapters in its Shonen Jump manga anthology. The remaining chapters were published straight to graphic novel, beginning with volume 5. The plot of the manga <b>is</b> <b>completely</b> <b>different</b> from the anime and is more of a continuation to the original Yu-Gi-Oh! series with Shadow Games and the Millennium Items playing a major role within the story. There are also new monsters and changes to some of the characters' personalities. Unlike the original Yu-Gi-Oh! manga, all the names used in the English version of the manga are taken from the dubbed anime. A one-shot of the GX manga was released on June 21, 2014 in the August issue of V-Jump. The one-shot was written and illustrated by Naoyuki Kageyama. An English version of this chapter was released on December 29, 2014 by Weekly Shonen Jump.|$|E
