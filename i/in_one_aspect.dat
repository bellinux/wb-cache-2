She criticised Maria Carolina for her political activities, Ferdinand for his lack of organisation, and Maria Amalia for her poor French and haughtiness.

25|$|A {{year after}} Oliver and Schäfer, Władysław Szymonowicz (1869–1939) and Napoleon Cybulski of the Jagiellonian University in Kraków {{reported}} essentially similar findings and conclusions. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect,</b> they {{went beyond the}} work in England: blood from the adrenal veins caused hypertension when injected intravenously in a recipient dog, whereas blood from other veins did not, showing that the adrenal pressor substance was in fact secreted into the blood and confirming Vulpian.|$|E
25|$|Weber {{suggests}} that just like Shiva {{is a combination}} of various Vedic gods Rudra and Agni, Parvati in Puranas text {{is a combination of}} wives of Rudra and Agni. In other words, the symbolism, legends and characteristics of Parvati evolved over time fusing Uma, Haimavati, Ambika <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> and the more ferocious, destructive Kali, Gauri, Nirriti in another aspect. Tate suggests Parvati is a mixture of the Vedic goddesses Aditi and Nirriti, and being a mountain goddess herself, was associated with other mountain goddesses like Durga and Kali in later traditions.|$|E

25|$|She also {{suggests}} video games can have social benefits for children, for example, video games {{can provide a}} topic of discussion and something over which children can bond, and can help children make friends; playing video games can increase a child's self-esteem when they are struggling <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of their life, but {{are able to do}} something correctly in a video game; and, children can also learn to take on leadership roles within a multi-player online game.

25|$|The plurality, {{joined by}} Chief Justice William Rehnquist, David Souter and Ruth Bader Ginsburg, {{held that the}} appeals court had {{proposed}} a test too onerous to the government to be broadly applied, but agreed that there was enough of a factual dispute over what Churchill had been fired for to remand the case to district court for that determination. Souter added a concurrence clarifying that the employers can act against unprotected employee speech when they believe their facts about the speech to be true, rather than just {{the result of a}} reasonable investigation. He also noted that, since the plurality holding had been joined by the other majority justices <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> and the dissenting justices in another, it was in fact a majority opinion.|$|E
25|$|The wolf plays a {{prominent}} role in the Serer religion's creation myth, where it is viewed as the first living creature created by Roog, the Supreme God and Creator. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect,</b> it can be viewed as an Earth-diver sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen prophet for disobeying the laws of the divine. The wolf was the first intelligent creature on earth, and it is believed that it will remain on earth after human beings have returned to the divine. The Serers believe that, not only does it know in advance who will die, but it traces the tracks in advance of those who will go to funerals. The movements of the wolf are carefully observed, because the animal is viewed as a seer who came from the transcendence and maintains links with it. Although believed to be rejected in the bush by other animals and deprived of its original intelligence, it is still respected because it dared to resist the supreme being who still keeps it alive.|$|E

25|$|Croteam used {{an array}} of {{automated}} and in-place tools to help rapidly design, debug, and test the game for playability. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect,</b> they recognized {{in the development of}} a puzzle game was that while puzzles could be designed with specific solutions, the process of creating the video game around the puzzle could create unsolvable situations or unforeseen shortcuts. To address this, they used a bot, developed by Croteam member Nathan Brown who had previously developed bots for other games including the ones incorporated into ports of Serious Sam 3 for consoles. The bot, named Bot, would watch the playthrough of a puzzle by a human player in terms of broad actions such as placing boxes on a switch for the completion of a puzzle. Then, as the puzzle's environment was tuned and decorated, they would have Bot attempt to solve the puzzle, testing to make sure it did not run into any dead-ends. If it did encounter any, Bot reported these through an in-house bug reporting system and then used game cheats to move on and finish out testing, which took between 30 and 60 minutes for the full game. As such, they were able to quickly iterate and resolve such problems when new features were introduced to the game. Overall, Croteam estimates they logged about 15,000 hours with Bot before the release of the public test version, and expect to use similar techniques in future games. They also used human playtesters to validate other more aesthetic factors of the games prior to the title's release.|$|E

500|$|Nineteen RNLI {{lifeboats}} {{sailed to}} Dunkirk between 27 May and 4 June 1940 {{to assist with}} the Dunkirk evacuation. Lifeboats from [...] and [...] went directly to France with their own crews. The crew of Ramsgate's Prudential (now Trimilia) (ON 697) collected 2,800 troops. Margate's Coxswain, Edward Parker, was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his work taking the [...] to the beaches. Of the other lifeboats and crews summoned to Dover by the Admiralty, the first arrivals questioned – reasonably in their view – the details of the service, in particular the impracticality of running heavy lifeboats on to the beach, loading them with soldiers, then floating them off. The dispute resulted in the first three crews being sent home. Subsequent lifeboats arriving were commandeered without discussion, much to the disappointment of many lifeboatmen. A later RNLI investigation resulted in the dismissal of two Hythe crew members, who were nevertheless vindicated <b>in</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect</b> of their criticism, as Hythe's Viscountess Wakefield was run on to the beach and unable to be refloated; she was the only lifeboat to be lost in the operation. Some RNLI crew members stayed in Dover for the emergency to provide repair and refuelling facilities, and {{after the end of the}} evacuation most lifeboats returned to their stations with varying levels of damage and continued their lifesaving services.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{two main}} varying {{versions}} regarding {{the creation of the}} first animals (non-humans). In both versions, the jackal {{is believed to be the}} first animal on Earth, and in accordance with the prevailing Serer view. Though there are differences in the [...] interpretation, they converge on certain points in the wider understanding of the jackal's significance in Serer mythology. <b>In</b> <b>one</b> <b>aspect,</b> the jackal can be viewed as an Earth-diver sent to Earth by Roog, in another, as a fallen prophet for disobeying the laws of the divine. In one narrative, the myth does not mention it by name, but only allude to it or when it does, the negative connotations are made obscure, because of its former closeness to the divine before it was disgraced for disobeying the laws of Roog from whose womb it grew out of.|$|E
