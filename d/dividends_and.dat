5|$|By {{the end of}} 1936, Aberhart's {{government}} had made no progress towards the promised dividends, leaving many Albertans disillusioned and frustrated. These Albertans included some of Aberhart's own Social Credit MLAs, who had been elected {{on the promise of}} <b>dividends</b> <b>and</b> were angry at Aberhart's failure to follow through. Some of them felt that, while the idea of social credit was sound, Aberhart lacked a real understanding of Douglas's theory and could not implement it. These MLAs wanted Douglas or somebody from his British organization to come to Alberta and deliver on Aberhart's campaign promises. One such MLA, Samuel Barnes, had been expelled from the Social Credit caucus and from the Social Credit League for voicing these views.|$|E

The modified plan would have provided across-the-board tax cuts by reducing income tax rates; eliminating income taxes on capital gains, <b>dividends,</b> <b>and</b> interest; and abolishing the estate tax and Alternative Minimum Tax. The plan would also have replaced the corporate income tax with a border-adjusted business consumption tax of 8.5%. The plan would have privatized a portion of Social Security and reduced benefits for those under 55, eliminated the tax exclusion for employer-sponsored health insurance, and privatized Medicare and Medicaid.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates whether {{managers}} rely on dividends {{to obtain}} a higher price in a stock offering and whether the stock price reaction to <b>dividend</b> <b>and</b> offering announcements justifies such a coordination.

Moreover, {{there is little evidence}} that firms time stock-offering announcements right after dividend declarations to benefit from the attendant information disclosure. The analysis of <b>dividend</b> <b>and</b> stock-offering announcement effects suggests few if any benefits from linking <b>dividend</b> <b>and</b> stock-offering announcements.

5|$|He {{also promised}} to seek income tax law changes {{that he said}} would help to lower federal deficits and would stimulate {{economic}} growth. These included: reducing individual income tax rates across the board by 20percent, maintaining the Bush administration-era tax rate of 15percent on investment income from <b>dividends</b> <b>and</b> capital gains (and eliminating this tax entirely for those with annual incomes less than $200,000), cutting the top tax rate on corporations from 35 to 25percent, and eliminating the estate tax and the Alternative Minimum Tax.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the interaction between}} a firm's volatility <b>and</b> <b>dividend</b> policies <b>and</b> capital structure and maturity policies. The firm is permitted to costlessly and continuously select any asset volatility <b>and</b> <b>dividend</b> yield, within bounds. Simple and intuitive rules are derived for the firm's optimal <b>dividend</b> <b>and</b> volatility choices. It is found that the firm always optimally selects either the maximal or minimal <b>dividend</b> yield <b>and</b> asset volatility and that these decisions depend, respectively, only upon the delta and gamma of the firm's equity. These optimal <b>dividend</b> <b>and</b> volatility policies are then implemented {{within the context of}} the Leland and Toft (1996) capital structure model. It is found that firms will optimally select a low <b>dividend</b> yield <b>and</b> a low asset volatility over a greater range of firm asset values the shorter is the maturity of the firm's debt.

This level of value generally contains a control premium over the intermediate level of value, which typically ranges from 25% to 50%.
