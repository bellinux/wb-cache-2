40|$|A {{fundamental}} question for developmental science is: how do young children represent {{the space around}} them. This question has been empirically approached {{from a number of}} angles. In this article, we describe some of these approaches and report on key findings regarding spatial cognition development in infants and young children. The specific areas covered here include developmental studies of spatial categorization in infants, spatial frames of reference available to infants and young children, <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> use by toddlers, and cultural variations in spatial thinking and spatial language...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Sex {{differences}} in spatial memory function {{have been reported}} with mixed results in the literature, with some studies showing male advantages and others showing no differences. When considering estrus cycle in females, results are mixed at to whether high or low circulating estradiol results in an advantage in spatial navigation tasks. Research involving humans and rodents has demonstrated males preferentially employ Euclidean strategies and utilize geometric cues in order to spatially navigate, whereas females employ landmark strategies and cues in order to spatially navigate. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: This study used the water-based snowcone maze {{in order to assess}} male and female preference for landmark or geometric cues, with specific emphasis placed on the effects of estrus cycle phase for female rat. Performance and preference for the <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> was examined in relation to total hippocampal and hippocampal subregions (CA 1 & 2, CA 3 and dentate gyrus) volumes and entorhinal cortex thickness {{in order to determine the}} relation between strategy and spatial performance and brain area size. The study revealed that males outperformed females overall during training trials, relied on the <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> when the platform was moved and showed significant correlations between entorhinal cortex thickness and spatial memory performance. No gross {{differences in}} behavioural performance was observed within females when accounting for cyclicity, and only total hippocampal volume was correlated with performance during the learning trials.

30|$|We {{generate}} the depth map information {{to exploit the}} line features from a single frame. This is used as an input source of extracting <b>geometric</b> <b>cue,</b> i.e., vanishing point (VP). Most scenes are composed of parallel lines. Parallel lines in real scenes appear to converge with distance in perspective image, eventually reaching a VP at the horizon. Linear perspective is an important depth cue for these scenes. Taking into account the information collected in the pre-process analysis, a series of intermediate steps are used to recover the final depth map. These steps can be resumed in vanishing line extraction, gradient planes generation, and depth gradient assignment.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{evaluate}} the proposal by Miller and Shettleworth (2007) that learning about <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> in environments with a distinctive shape is governed by a competitive learning rule (e. g., Rescorla & Wagner, 1972). To do this, in all experiments, rats were trained to locate a hidden platform by reference {{to the shape of}} a swimming pool. Chapter 2 (Experiments 1 - 4) assessed whether a landmark suspended above the platform would overshadow learning about <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> No overshadowing was recorded, even when the salience of the <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> was reduced. These findings are inconsistent with the model of Miller and Shettleworth (2007). In Chapter 3 (Experiments 5 - 7), a blocking paradigm was used. When rats were given extended pre-training with a landmark above the platform, only then did the landmark successfully block learning about <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> However, some unexpected findings suggested that perhaps the spatial cues were competing for attention rather than associative strength. The experiments in Chapter 4 (Experiments 8 and 9) successfully demonstrated superconditioning of <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> by an inhibitory landmark providing convincing evidence that learning about <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> is governed by the principles of associative learning. Miller and ShettlewortiVs (2007) model however, failed to predict this outcome. Experiments 10 - 13 in Chapters 5 and 6 showed that associations formed between <b>geometric</b> and non-geometric <b>cues.</b> This outcome provides the basis for a viable explanation for potentiation and for the past failures to find cue competition in the spatial domain. The empirical findings of this thesis show that learning about <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> is not entirely void of associative processes as once thought. A number of recent models of spatial learning are discussed. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Rats in {{the first}} 2 experiments, which were {{designed}} to test predictions from a model of spatial learning by N. Y. Miller and S. J. Shettleworth (2007), had to escape from a triangular pool by swimming to a submerged platform in a geometrically unique corner. A spherical landmark was suspended above the platform for an overshadowing group. A control group was trained with the same arrangement and with a second, identical landmark suspended in another corner. The platform could thus be found by reference to the landmark or the <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> in the overshadowing group, whereas the control group {{had to rely on}} <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> There was no indication of overshadowing between the <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> and the landmark in the overshadowing group. The final 2 experiments revealed that the absence of overshadowing was not a consequence of the landmark being an ineffective cue for overshadowing. The results indicate either that the landmark and <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> were not in competition for the control they acquired over behavior or that an additional process compensated for any such competition that might have occurred in the overshadowing group. This additional process could involve between-cues associations or the provision of a stable spatial framework...|$|R
40|$|In a {{two-dimensional}} computer-based search task, human {{participants were required}} to learn {{the location of a}} goal by using the geometric information available on the screen.

Furthermore, when one shape was pretrained as a signal for the location of the goal, learning about the <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> of the other shape was blocked.

40|$|This paper employs {{substrates}} {{that are}} patterned with shapes having well-defined <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> {{to characterize the}} influence of curvature on the polarization of highly metastatic B 16 F 10 rat melanoma cells. Substrates were patterned using microcontact printing to define adhesive islands of defined shape and size on a background that otherwise prevents cell adhesion.

Cells adherent to rectangular shapes displayed a polarized cytoskeleton that increased with the aspect ratio of the shapes. Shapes that combined local <b>geometric</b> <b>cues,</b> by way of concave or convex edges, with as-pect ratio were used to understand the additive effects of shape on polarization. The dependence of cell polarity on shape was determined in the presence of small molecules that alter actomyosin contractility and revealed a stronger dependence on contractility for shapes having straight edges, in contrast to those having curved edges.

40|$|Rats {{were trained}} in a {{triangular}} water maze in which a compound of <b>geometric</b> and landmark <b>cues</b> indicated {{the position of a}} submerged platform. Rats that then underwent revaluation of the <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> {{in the absence of the}} landmarks subsequently failed to discriminate between the landmarks. In contrast, those animals that received geometry training consistent with their previous experience of the geometryâlandmark compound continued to discriminate the landmark cues. The experiment showed that within-compound associations had formed between the geometry and landmarks, and that representations of absent <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> could be evoked via presentation of the landmark cues alone. We argue that these evoked representations of the absent geometry cues can counteract any overshadowing of the landmark by geometry cues, and may sometimes result in potentiation. The results of this study do not support theories of cue-competition failure based on independent cue processing, but remain readily explicable by appeal to an account based on within-compound associations...|$|R

Our results indicate that tilted mice did not perform significantly differently than control mice on most aspects of this task, indicating that they are able to process geometric cues similarly to control mice on this task.

40|$|We {{propose a}} new method for {{quantitative}} characterization of spatial network-like patterns with loops, such as surface fracture patterns, leaf vein networks {{and patterns of}} urban streets. Such patterns are not well characterized by purely topological estimators: also patterns that both look different and result from different morphogenetic processes can have similar topology. A local <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> -the angles formed by the different branches at junctions- can complement topological information and allow to quantify the large scale spatial coherence of the pattern. For patterns that grow over time, such as fracture lines {{on the surface of}} ceramics, the rank assigned by our method to each individual segment of the pattern approximates the order of appearance of that segment. We apply the method to various network-like patterns and we find a continuous but sharp dichotomy between two classes of spatial networks: hierarchical and homogeneous. The first class results from a sequential growth process and presents large scale organization, the latter presents local, but not global organization. Comment: version 2, 14 page...|$|E

Heart failure is characterized by an irreversible loss of functional heart muscle cells. Although there are many advantages made in the current therapeutic options, unfortunately until now {{it is not possible to}} restore heart muscle function by replacing or regenerating new cardiac cells. This study in the field of cardioregenerative medicine focuses on the proliferation and differentiation of embryonic heart cells and cardiac progenitors into cardiomyocytes. In this study, an effective screening method with small molecules is set up to screen for potential stimulators of early cardiomyocyte proliferation. At least 4 compounds have been identified as promoters of cardiomyocyte expanding and further research would elucidate their working mechanisms and possibly unravel new pathways of cardiogenesis. Lineage commitment of cardiac progenitor cells to the cardiomyocyte cell line is a complicated process in which many influencing factors are involved. Here, we examined whether cell shape as a <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> plays a role in the differentiation of cardiac progenitors into cardiomyocytes.

Previous reinforcement of either kind of cue (geometric and non-geometric) resulted in second order conditioning (SOC) when the participants were tested with the cue that was never paired with reinforcement (Experiment 1). Similarly, if one of the cues was reinforced following the non-reinforced exposure to the compound, a sensory preconditioning (SPC) effect was observed (Experiment 3). These results show that associations can be formed between geometric and non-geometric cues, a finding that is incompatible with the concept of a geometric module impenetrable to non-geometric information. In Experiments 2 and 4, we found evidence for SOC and SPC using exclusively geometric cues, suggesting that the associative learning principles that apply to other domains also rule spatial geometry learning in humans. This research suggests that spatial representations can be enlarged by successively integrating information bits through the linkage of common elements. 8838...|$|E

In Experiment 2, the correct platform was identifiable from its position within the three platform array. Learning the relative position of the correct platform within the array disrupted learning about its position relative to the geometry of the pool, but not to the colored walls.

In particular we show how to interpret the motion parallax vector of a fourth point and the curl, divergence and deformation components of the affine transformation (defined by the three points of the plane) in order to recover the projection of the axis of rotation of a moving object; the change in relative position of the object; the rotation about the ray; the tilt of the surface and a one parameter family of solutions for the slant {{as a function of the}} magnitude of the rotation of the object.

40|$|Luminance {{and color}} are strong and {{self-sufficient}} cues to pictorial depth in visual scenes and images. The present study investigates the conditions Under which luminance or color either strengthens or overrides <b>geometric</b> depth <b>cues.</b> We investigated how luminance contrasts associated with color contrast interact with relative height {{in the visual}} field, partial occlusion, and interposition in determining {{the probability that a}} given figure is perceived as âânearerââ than another. Latencies of âânearââ responses were analyzed to test for effects of attentional selection. Figures in a pair were supported by luminance contrast or isoluminant color contrast and combined with one of the three <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> The results of Experiment 1 show that luminance contrasts associated with hue, when it does not interact with other hues, produces the same effects as achromatic luminance contrasts: The probability ofâânearââ increases with luminance contrast while the latencies for âânearââ responses decrease. Partial occlusion is found to be a strong enough pictorial cue to support a weaker red luminance contrast. Interposition cues lose out against cues of spatial position and partial occlusion. The results of Experiment 2, with isoluminant displays of varying color contrast, reveal that red color contrast on a light background supported by any of the three <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> wins over green or white supported by any of the three <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> On a dark background, red color contrast supported by the interposition cue loses out against green or white color contrast supported by partial occlusion. These findings reveal that color is not an independent depth cue, but is strongly influenced by luminance contrast and stimulus geometry.

40|$|ABSTRACTâAnimals of {{many species}} use the {{geometric}} {{shape of an}} enclosed rectangular environment to reorient, even {{in the presence of}} a more informative featural cue. Manipulating the rearing environment affects perfor-mance on spatial tasks, but its effect on the use of geometric versus featural navigational cues is unknown. Our study varied the geometric information available in the rearing environment (circular vs. rectangular rearing tanks) of convict cichlids (Archocentrus nigrofasciatus) and tested their use of navigational cues. All the fish used geometric information to navigate when no features were present. When features were present, the fish used geometric and featural information separately. If cues were in conflict, fish raised in a circular tank showed significantly less use of geometric information than fish raised in a rectangular tank. Thus, the ability to use geometry to navigate does not require exposure to angular <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> during rear-ing, though rearing environment affects the dominance of featural and <b>geometric</b> <b>cues...</b>|$|R
40|$|Humans and {{non-human}} animals must navigate {{their environments}} to survive. A recent question {{of interest is}} whether humans {{have the ability to}} combine multiple cues to navigation in a Bayesian optimal manner. The current experiments build on previous research examining the combination of cues in adult humans. These experiments further the theoretical understanding of cue combination as well as its application to real-world tasks. Experiment 1 determined that idiothetic path integration cues are not necessary for the optimal combination of path integration and piloting cues. Instead, optic flow, an allothetic path integration cue, was sufficient for the optimal combination of path integration and a <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> to navigation. Experiment 2 examined cue combination for two piloting cues to navigation, rather than for a piloting and path integration cue, and found that two piloting cues to navigation are not always combined in a Bayesian optimal manner. Finally, Bayesian cue combination was examined in a two-dimensional desktop environment to determine whether optimal cue integration occurs in the desktop and webpage environments we interact with on a daily basis. Results indicate further study is needed, but illustrate the importance of testing a variety of stimuli when examining cue integration. Together, the following experiments expand the current knowledge regarding how multiple cues to navigation are used together to improve spatial memory and illustrate that small differences in stimuli may have a great impact on the ability to detect optimal cue integration...|$|E

40|$|The {{collective}} migration of cells {{is fundamental to}} epithelial biology. One {{of the hallmarks of}} collective behavior in migrating cohesive epithelial cell sheets is the emergence of so called leader cells. These cells exhibit a distinct morphology with a large and highly active lamellipodium. Although it is generally accepted that they play a crucial part in {{collective migration}}, the biophysical factors that regulate their formation remain unknown. Here we show that a geometry-based cue like local variation of curvature of the collective's perimeter is capable of triggering leader cell formation and promoting enhanced motility at defined positions. Remarkably, the extent of this effect scales with the magnitude of the curvature. Cytoskeletal tension was found to be important for geometry induced leader cell formation, as cells treated with tension reducing agents appeared less sensitive to local curvature variation. Accordingly, traction force microscopy revealed an increased level of shear stress at highly curved positions even before the cell migration had actually started, indicating the presence of a collective polarization induced by the geometry of the confinement. Together our findings suggest that high curvature leads to locally increased stress accumulation, mediated via cell-substrate interaction as well as via cytoskeleton tension. The stress accumulation in turn enhances the probability of leader cell formation as well as cell motility. This work defines the importance of <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> such as local curvature in the collective migration dynamics of epithelial cells and thus shows implications for the biophysical regulation of epithelium during wound healing, embryonic development, and oncogenesis...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{environmental}} geometry as a spatial cue {{is well established}} {{for a range of}} species. Previous research has focused largely on the use of global geometry (e. g., the shape of a room). Thus, comparatively less is known about how local geometry (e. g., corner angles within a room) is encoded. The purpose of the research presented in this thesis was to examine how angular information is encoded and to determine whether angle size influences encoding, using a discrimination task and a spatial array task. Chapter 2 presents a study during which pigeons were trained to discriminate between a small (60 Â°) and large (120 Â°) angle. Once the birds were accurately choosing the angle associated with reward, they were tested on their ability to discriminate between their training angle and {{one of a series of}} novel angles. The pigeons showed an absolute learning pattern for the small training angle, but not the large angle. The significance of this result is that the small angle may have been perceived as more distinctive compared to the large angle. Adopting a comparative approach, Chapter 3 presents a study during which adult humans were trained and tested using a similar paradigm but with different training angles (25 Â°, 50 Â° and 75 Â°). The results of this study also support an absolute learning pattern for the small training angle but not the large. These results are significant in that they suggest that angle size may be an important local <b>geometric</b> <b>cue</b> that is encoded in a similar way by both pigeons and humans. To understand how angular information may be processed during a spatial task, Chapter 4 presents a study during which adult humans were trained and tested on their ability to use local angles (either 50 Â° or 75 Â°) to find a goal location within an object array. The results showed that the smaller angle was used more effectively as a spatial cue than the larger angle. Overall, these results are important as they suggest that small and large angles are encoded differently by pigeons and humans, with small angles perceived as more distinctive than large angles...|$|E

40|$|Several recent {{models of}} episodic memory have {{highlighted}} a potential contribution from the head-direction system; there is, however, surprisingly little {{known about the}} behavioural effects of selective lesions within the head-direction system. To address this issue, and determine what aspects of spatial memory are dependent on the head-direction system, rats with selective lateral mammillary body lesions were tested on tasks that required the use of specific spatial cues, including direction, visual allocentric, and <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> Animals were first tested on {{a modified version of}} the T-maze alternation task that enabled the systematic removal of intramaze and visual allocentric cues. Rats were next tested on a geometric task that required the use of the shape of the environment to locate a hidden platform in the water-maze. The lesion rats were impaired on one stage of the T-maze alternation task and on the acquisition of the geometric task; these results are consistent with the head-direction system contributing to the processing of, and/or subsequent use, of visual allocentric and <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> From the pattern of impairments it also appears that, with training, rats with lateral mammillary body lesions are able to recruit other navigational systems or that there is some degree of redundancy within the head-direction system...|$|R
40|$|Assembly and {{disassembly}} of adhesion {{structures such as}} focal adhesions (FAs) and podosomes regulate {{cell adhesion}} and differentiation. On antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs), acquisition of a migratory and immunostimulatory phenotype depends on podosome dissolution by prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2). Whereas the effects of physico-chemical and topographical cues have been extensively studied on FAs, {{little is known about}} how podosomes respond to these signals. Here, we show that, unlike for FAs, podosome formation is not controlled by substrate physico-chemical properties. We demonstrate that cell adhesion is the only prerequisite for podosome formation and that substrate availability dictates podosome density. Interestingly, we show that DCs sense 3 -dimensional (3 -D) geometry by aligning podosomes along the edges of 3 -D micropatterned surfaces. Finally, whereas on a 2 -dimensional (2 -D) surface PGE 2 causes a rapid increase in activated RhoA levels leading to fast podosome dissolution, 3 -D <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> prevent PGE 2 -mediated RhoA activation resulting in impaired podosome dissolution even after prolonged stimulation. Our findings indicate that 2 -D and 3 -D <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> control the spatial organization of podosomes. More importantly, our studies demonstrate the importance of substrate dimensionality in regulating podosome dissolution and suggest that substrate dimensionality {{plays an important role in}} controlling DC activation, a key process in initiating immune responses...|$|R
40|$|In three experiments, rats {{were trained}} to locate a {{submerged}} platform {{in one of the}} base corners of a triangular arena above each of which was suspended one of two distinctive landmarks. In Experiment 1, it was established that these landmarks differed in their salience by the differential control they gained over behavior after training in compound with <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> In Experiment 2, it was shown that locating the platform beneath the less salient landmark potentiated learning based on geometry compared with control rats for which landmarks provided ambiguous information about the location of the platform. The presence of the more salient landmark above the platform for another group of animals appeared to have no effect on learning based on geometry. Experiment 3 established that these landmark and geometry cues entered into within-compound associations during compound training. We argue that these within-compound associations can account for the potentiation seen in Experiment 2, as well as previous failures to demonstrate overshadowing of <b>geometric</b> <b>cues.</b> We also suggest that these within-compound associations need not be of different magnitudes, despite the different effects of each of the landmarks on learning based on geometry seen in Experiment 2. Instead, within-compound associations appear to mitigate the overshadowing effects that traditional theories of associative learning would predict...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we are {{interested}} in the saliency of visual content from wearable cameras. The subjective saliency in wearable video is studied first due to the psycho-visual experience on this content. Then the method for objective saliency map computation with a specific contribution based on geometrical saliency is proposed. Fusion of spatial, temporal and <b>geometric</b> <b>cues</b> in an objective saliency map is realized by the multiplicative operator. Resulting objective saliency maps are evaluated against the subjective maps with promising results, highlighting interesting performance of proposed geometric saliency model...|$|R
