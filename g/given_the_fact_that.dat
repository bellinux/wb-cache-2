5|$|Betances' remains {{arrived in}} San Juan, Puerto Rico on August 5, 1920, and were honored upon arrival by a crowd then {{estimated}} at 20,000 mourners. The large crowd, which had assembled near {{the port of}} San Juan as early as 4:00a.m. (AST) that morning, was the largest ever assembled for a funeral in Puerto Rico {{since the death of}} Luis Muñoz Rivera three years earlier. Media reporters of the day were surprised {{by the size of the}} crowd, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Betances had not visited Puerto Rico (at least in the open) for the 31 years before his death, and had been dead over 21 years afterwards.|$|E
5|$|The Senate {{as a body}} {{remained}} {{devoid of}} any significant power; nevertheless, the senators, who had been marginalized as potential holders of imperial functions during the 3rd century, could now dispute such positions alongside more upstart bureaucrats. Some modern historians see in those administrative reforms an attempt by Constantine at reintegrating the senatorial order into the imperial administrative elite to counter the possibility of alienating pagan senators from a Christianized imperial rule; however, such an interpretation remains conjectural, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{we do not have}} the precise numbers about pre-Constantine conversions to Christianity in the old senatorial milieu—some historians suggesting that early conversions among the old aristocracy were more numerous than previously supposed.|$|E
5|$|Caio Duilio {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Regio Cantieri di Castellammare di Stabia on 24 February 1912. She was {{launched}} on 24 April 1913, and completed on 10 May 1916. She saw no action in World War I, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> the Austro-Hungarian fleet, Italy's main naval rival, remained in port {{for the duration of}} the conflict. In addition, Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel, the Italian naval chief of staff, believed that Austro-Hungarian submarines and minelayers could operate too effectively in the narrow waters of the Adriatic. The threat from these underwater weapons to his capital ships was too serious for him to use the fleet in an active way. Instead, Revel decided to implement blockade at the relatively safer southern end of the Adriatic with the battle fleet, while smaller vessels, such as the MAS boats, conducted raids on Austro-Hungarian ships and installations. Meanwhile, Revel's battleships would be preserved to confront the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet in the event that it sought a decisive engagement.|$|E

5|$|<b>Given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> HIT predisposes {{strongly}} to new episodes of thrombosis, {{it is not}} sufficient to simply discontinue the heparin administration. Generally, an alternative anticoagulant is needed to suppress the thrombotic tendency while the generation of antibodies stops and the platelet count recovers. To make matters more complicated, the other most commonly used anticoagulant, warfarin, should not be used in HIT until the platelet count is at least 150 x 10^9/L because there is a very high risk of warfarin necrosis in people with HIT who have low platelet counts. Warfarin necrosis is the development of skin gangrene in those receiving warfarin or a similar vitamin K inhibitor. If the patient was receiving warfarin at the time when HIT is diagnosed, the activity of warfarin is reversed with vitamin K. Transfusing platelets is discouraged, as there is a theoretical risk that this may worsen the risk of thrombosis; the platelet count is rarely low enough to be the principal cause of significant hemorrhage.|$|E
5|$|Omaha {{arrived at}} Port of Spain, on 17 November 1941, with Odenwald flying the German flag on the mast with the US flag flying over it. It {{was not until}} 30 April 1947, that a case was brought by Odenwalds owners in the District Court for Puerto Rico, against the US. Their claim stated that because {{a state of war}} between the United States and Germany did not exist at the time of capture the vessel could not be taken as a prize or bounty. The court however, <b>given</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Odenwald was rescued from sinking by the US crew, {{declared}} that the seizing of the ship was defined as a legal salvage operation. The US was awarded the profits that were made from Odenwald and her cargo. All the men of the original boarding party received $3,000 each, {{while the rest of the}} crewmen in Omaha and Somers, at the time, were entitled to two months' pay and allowances. The laws have since been revised, making this the last time that US Navy members received such an award.|$|E

25|$|In Portugal, these barrows {{are called}} mamoa, from the Latin mammula, {{given to them}} by the Romans because of their shape, similar to the breast of a woman (mama in Portuguese).
