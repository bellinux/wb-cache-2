40|$|Background: It {{has been}} {{postulated}} that elliptical cutaneous excisions must possess a length-to-width ratio of 3 to 4 and a <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 º {{or less in}} order to be closed primarily without creating a “dog ear”. These dimensions became axiomatic in cutaneous surgery and have been taught in the apprenticeship model for years. The present article examines the validity of that paradigm. Methods: We collected data from two sources: ellipses described in the literature (57 cases); and elliptical excisions performed at the authors’ outpatient clinic (83 cases). The surgical ellipse lengths, widths, and <b>vertex</b> <b>angles</b> were analyzed, and the data were compared to a mathematical formula used to generate a fusiform ellipse. Results: The length-to-width ratio of 3 - 4 was found to be inconsistent with the recommended <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 º. In fact, a length-to-width ratio of 3 - 4 determines a <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> of 48 º - 63 º. A 30 º <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> is only feasible with long length-to-width ration of about 7. 5. Conclusions: The paradigm that surgical ellipses should have a <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> of 30 º with length-to-width ratio of 3 - 4 is incorrect. Evidence from actual surgical practice and from mathematical formulation shows that either the length-to-width ratio must be larger than 3 - 4 or the <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> must be larger than 30 degrees. </p...|$|R

40|$|A {{new kind}} of surface -conduction {{electron}} -emitter (SCE) with a triangular dielectric layer under the conductive film is proposed. The influences of the <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> (theta) of the triangular dielectric layer and the anode voltage (U-a) on the electron emission efficiency and the focusing capability have been investigated with the finite integration technique (FIT). The numerical simulation results show that SCE with a small <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> guarantees higher electron emission efficiency even with a low anode voltage. But the focusing capability of the electron emitter will get worse when the theta or U-a becomes too small. Take both the electron emission efficiency and focusing capability into consideration, the structure with a <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> (theta) between 60 degrees- 100 degrees and the anode voltage of 1500 V is suggested. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractZig-zag antennas are {{preferred}} in VHF applications. In conventional Zig-zag antenna {{structure the}} important parameters are pitch angle(α),and segment length of Zig-Zag elements. The <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> and segment length are constant for a conventional uniform Zig-Zag antenna. This paper proposes a methodology for optimal design of Zig-Zag antenna with nonlinear segment length and varying <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> for maximizing gain with circular polarization. Segment length and pitch {{angle of the}} antenna are parametrically modeled using B-Splines. Optimization is done using particle swarm optimisation(PSO) and antenna parameters are estimated using Numerical Electromagnetic Code(NEC 2). The C++ source code of NEC 2 software is suitably modiﬁed to incorporate spline modeling and PSO. Numerical simulation results shows that the antenna modeled by proposed method gives better gain characteristics compared to antenna with constant length and <b>vertex</b> <b>angle...</b>|$|R

40|$|In chapter 1, {{a general}} {{introduction}} into the rationale of surgery and various techniques for cutaneous excisional biopsies and repairing the defects were described. In the studies described in chapter 2, the most economical patterns {{with regard to}} extra skin waste, scar length and <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> were investigated. A comparison of minimum waste area showed that the best patterns were the rhomboid and the mosque excision. The second comparison of the scar length showed that the length was almost independent of the pattern. The third comparison showed that the rhomboid and the S-shape patterns possessed the smallest <b>vertex</b> <b>angles</b> and thus minimized the formation of dog ear. Interestingly, the common surgical ellipse was observed {{not to have any}} advantage in any of the cut pattern categories. The currently held paradigm that the <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> of a surgical ellipse should be 30 ° or less for length-to-width ratios of lower than 4 was found to be mathematically incorrect. The circular excision pattern, i. e. a direct excision of a round lesion, was found superior to other patterns that were examined in that there was no skin waste and that the resulting scar length was the shortest. However, the circular excision had the highest <b>vertex</b> <b>angle</b> (180 °), which resulted in large dog ear formation during closure...|$|R
