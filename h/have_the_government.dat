5|$|Although a Senate seat {{would be}} {{disposed}} of by the Ohio General Assembly after the resignation of John Sherman to become Treasury Secretary, Hayes needed Garfield's expertise {{to protect him from}} the agenda of a hostile Congress, and asked him not to seek it. Garfield, as the president's key legislator, gained considerable prestige and respect for his role. When Congress debated what became the Bland-Allison Act, to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> purchase large quantities of silver and strike it into fully legal tender dollar coins, Garfield fought against this deviation from the gold standard, but it was enacted over Hayes's veto in February 1878.|$|E
5|$|Giles Guthrie, a {{respected}} aviator, merchant banker {{and director of}} British European Airways who would take over from Slattery as chairman and chief executive, also intended to perform some of the managing director's roles, making Smallpeice's position essentially redundant; Smallpeice was asked to resign by Amery, leaving the company late in 1963 to facilitate Guthrie's new management structure. Smallpeice, like Slattery, considered that had effectively been sacked. The concerns Slattery and Smallpeice expressed about the financial arrangements {{of the company and}} Vickers VC10 purchases would be vindicated when Guthrie was able to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> write off the outstanding debt, inject additional cash into the company, and permit the purchase of a smaller number of Vickers VC10 aircraft. The Corbett report was never made public; neither Slattery, Smallpeice nor Guthrie are believed to have been given access to the full report.|$|E

50|$|A {{telephone}} company can experience problems when {{large numbers of}} callers attempt to use the system at the same time. This generally only happens in exceptional circumstances such as a disaster or national emergency, but can result in some calls not going through at all. <b>The</b> United States <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> Emergency Telecommunications Service and Nationwide Wireless Priority Service, and <b>the</b> United Kingdom(UK) <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> Telephone Preference Scheme and ACCOLC to allow official calls to go through reliably in emergencies.|$|R
25|$|Since the announcement, the City of Toronto and {{community}} groups have begun a lobbying campaign to restore funding, similar to the campaign leading to the initial funding. Mayor Miller has condemned the funding delay and requested riders to contact their Members of Provincial Parliament to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> restore the funding. Other Transit City advocates also petitioned and organized rallies to promote the immediate construction of the projects.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the years}} some Chinese {{citizens}} {{have called for}} a reassessment of the protests and compensation from the government to victims' families. One group in particular, Tiananmen Mothers, seeks compensation, vindication for victims and the right to receive donations from within the mainland and abroad. Zhang Shijun, a former soldier who was involved in the military crackdown, had published an open letter to President Hu Jintao seeking to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> reevaluate its position on the protests. He was subsequently arrested and taken from his home.|$|E
25|$|When North Carolina {{considered}} {{where to}} establish the county seat for its new Hawkins County, Rogers successfully lobbied to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> located near his home. He volunteered his tavern, which had been established about 1784-85, as the first county courthouse, where it was finally established in 1787. With the help of other local settlers, Rogers laid out {{a plan for the}} town, and the town of Rogersville was chartered by the North Carolina General Assembly in 1789. The plan included a public square, deeded to the town government, which would host the town's public well and a county courthouse.|$|E

25|$|A better {{approach}} {{seemed to}} be to offer carrots instead of sticks. In the first place captains were given some leeway by allowing them {{a certain percentage of}} missing troops, without consequences for their payment. Also, in some cases the nominal strength of companies was lowered intentionally, at the same time keeping the amount of payments constant, thereby giving the troops a pay rise in the bargain. But the best approach would be to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> take over the entrepreneurial risks of the captain. However, this did only happen in the Republic in the reforms of William III after 1672.|$|E
25|$|In shaping legislation, Rayburn {{preferred}} working {{quietly in}} the background to being in the public spotlight. As Speaker, he won a reputation for fairness and integrity. In his years in Congress, Rayburn always insisted on paying his own expenses, even {{going so far as}} to pay for his own travel expenses when inspecting the Panama Canal when his committee was considering legislation concerning it, rather than exercising his right to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> pay for it. After he died his estate was valued at just under $300,000, which was mostly land he owned, and the amount of cash he had in various checking accounts was just over $26,000.|$|E
500|$|Meade {{found the}} time that Benjamin spent as {{attorney}} general to be fruitful, as it allowed {{him the opportunity to}} judge Davis's character and to ingratiate himself with the president. Benjamin served as a host, entertaining dignitaries and others Davis had no time to see. At the first Cabinet meeting, Benjamin counseled Davis to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> buy 150,000 bales of cotton for shipment to the United Kingdom, with the proceeds used to buy arms and for future needs. [...] His advice was not taken, as the Cabinet believed the war would be short and successful. Benjamin was called upon {{from time to time to}} render legal opinions, writing on April 1 to assure Treasury Secretary Christopher Memminger that lemons and oranges could enter the Confederacy duty-free, but walnuts could not.|$|E

500|$|With {{the sound}} mix being {{completed}} in LA, Harrison {{spent most of}} September 1971 in New York working on the problematic film footage of the concert, before heading to London. There he attended the re-opening of Apple Studio on 30 September and produced new signing Lon & Derrek Van Eaton's debut single, as well as enduring a fruitless meeting with the British Treasury's financial secretary – the latter activity {{in an attempt to}} <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> waive its standard purchase tax, and so keep the album affordable to record-buyers. Harrison returned to New York on 5 October and announced that the Bangladesh live album would be issued during the following month. At this time, with concert bootlegs now on the market, posters were placed in record shops bearing the slogan: [...] "Save a starving child. Don't buy a bootleg!" ...|$|E
500|$|The Massachusetts colonial {{leadership}} {{headed by}} ex-governor Simon Bradstreet then urged Governor Andros to surrender {{for his own}} safety, citing the mob of which they claimed to be [...] "wholly ignorant". [...] He refused and instead tried to escape to the Rose. [...] A boat that came ashore from the Rose was intercepted by militia, and Andros was forced back into Fort Mary. [...] Negotiations ensued and Andros agreed to leave the fort {{to meet with the}} rebel council. [...] He was promised safe conduct and marched under guard to the townhouse where the council had assembled. [...] There he was told that [...] "they must and would <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> in their own hands", as an anonymous account describes it, and that he was under arrest. [...] He was taken to the home of dominion official John Usher and held under close watch.|$|E
500|$|Greenbacks, {{which were}} backed by neither silver nor gold {{but by the}} credit of the United States, and which were necessitated by vast wartime expenditures, had helped to finance the war. In the late 1860s, {{politicians}} disagreed about how quickly to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> resume paying out gold and silver in payment of its obligations. Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch felt {{the best way to}} return to that practice was to withdraw the greenbacks as quickly as possible, and he did so until stopped by Congress, which felt his contractionist stand was hurting the economy. [...] More and more silver was being mined in the Far West. [...] Falls in the price of the metal made the option of depositing silver at the Mint in exchange for coin more attractive, and mintages of the silver dollar rose considerably in the late 1860s and into the 1870s. [...] The silver dollar was fully legal tender, and some officials worried that the increased deposits would cause silver to drive gold from circulation as predicted by Gresham's Law, endangering the gold standard.|$|E

500|$|On 18 April 1689, {{soon after}} news reached Boston of the {{overthrow}} of James II of England, the colonists of Boston rose up against his rule. [...] A well-organized [...] "mob" [...] descended on the city, arresting dominion officials and Anglicans. [...] Andros had his quarters in Fort Mary, a garrison house {{on the south side}} of the city, where a number of officials took refuge. [...] The old Massachusetts colonial leadership, restored due to the rebellion and headed by ex-governor Simon Bradstreet, then summoned Governor Andros to surrender, for his own safety because of the mob which they claimed [...] "whereof we were wholly ignorant". [...] He refused, and instead tried to escape to the Rose, the sole element of the Royal Navy present near Boston at the time of the revolt. [...] However, the boat sent from the Rose was intercepted by militia, and Andros was forced back into Fort Mary.

2500|$|The stock-market {{crash of}} 19 October 1987 damaged {{confidence}} in the New Zealand economy, which went into a prolonged recession from December of that year, and remained so until June 1991.

2500|$|Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife (" [...] raising only a {{generally}} available grievance about government—claiming only harm to his and every citizen’s interest in proper {{application of the}} Constitution and laws, and seeking relief that no more directly and tangibly benefits him than it does the public at large—does not state an Article III case or controversy."), Allen v. Wright ("an asserted right to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> act in accordance with law is not sufficient, standing alone, to confer jurisdiction on a federal court"), Diamond v. Charles (Article III standing [...] "is not {{to be placed in}} the hands of ‘concerned bystanders,’ who will use it simply as a ‘vehicle for the vindication of value interests.’"), Arizonans for Official English ("Nor has this Court ever identified initiative proponents as Article-III-qualified defenders of the measures they advocated."), Karcher v.

2500|$|The ruling {{also drew}} upon a [...] "lengthy pedigree" [...] of similar rulings {{on the same}} point of law, such as Lujan v.

May (Citizens who had standing in their 'public official' roles did not retain standing once they left public office), and other cases unanimous on the point. The ruling summed up that Californian law provides a [...] "right of proponents to defend their initiatives in California courts where Article III does not apply", but standing in federal court is based upon federal, not state, law; the same reasoning also invalidated the previous hearing by the Ninth Circuit.|$|E
