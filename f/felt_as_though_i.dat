500|$|Olga was due {{to enter}} society {{in the summer of}} 1899, but after the death of her brother George at the age of 27, her first {{official}} public appearance was delayed by a year until 1900. She hated the experience, and later told her official biographer Ian Vorres, [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were an animal in a cage—exhibited to the public for the first time." [...] From 1901, Olga was appointed honorary Commander-in-Chief of the 12th Akhtyrsky Hussar Regiment of the Imperial Russian Army. The Akhtyrsky Hussars were famous for their victory over Napoleon Bonaparte at the Battle of Kulm in 1813, and wore a distinctive brown dolman.|$|E
500|$|Due to {{injuries}} to first team centre backs Simon Webster and Darren Pitcher, Primus made his professional debut against Birmingham City. The match {{took place at}} their substitute stadium Upton Park in November 1992 and Primus was awarded man of the match for his performance. Primus played the next two matches against Leicester City and Brentford but was disappointed with his performances. Primus made two further first team appearances in the 1992–93 season but soon found himself lower in the pecking order after other players returned from injury and Primus got injured. He {{felt that he had}} to leave the club: [...] "I really <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wasn't wanted and that my days were numbered." ...|$|E
500|$|Two {{weeks prior}} to the group {{starting}} university, they decided that they would take a second gap year, and perform new material which the band felt did not suit their current outfit. Cave stated that [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> couldn't write about anything personal, so I would make up semi-comical stories that weren't really important to anyone, not even me." [...] Fear of Flying disbanded in October 2007 with a MySpace bulletin stating [...] "Fear of Flying is DEAD ... White Lies is alive!", before introducing a darker sound and a new name that reflected their maturity. Cave stated that the band deleted their MySpace account [...] "without any token farewell gigs". McVeigh said that the current musical climate {{had an effect on}} the split, stating that [...] "Maybe a few years ago, we would have signed a deal and had a chance to make three albums [...] In the current climate...we’d have been dropped". When asked about the name change in an interview with a radio station in San Francisco, Jack Brown said that [...] "We just thought that we should perform these songs as a different band. We had songs that we felt weren't suitable for the band that we were in and we thought White Lies would be the perfect vehicle for the songs." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Bundercombe {{adjusted}} her spectacles severely and transferred her regard to me. <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were back {{at school and}} had been discovered in some ignominious escapade.|$|R

2500|$|Jeff Cork from Game Informer {{scored the}} game an 8/10, saying: [...] "Creation and {{discovery}} are at Tearaways foundation, and I was still pleasantly {{surprised at the}} steady drip of new abilities, gameplay elements, and other novelties delivered throughout. Not everything lands, but the parts that do are outstanding. One thing did seem {{to get lost in}} the move to PS4, though: Tearaway on Vita was an intimate experience. Holding the device close to my face, it <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was privy to a secret directly from Media Molecule. I’m glad to see the adventure on the big screen, but the console experience feels less personal, and the journey loses {{a little bit in the}} transition. That said, Tearaway Unfolded is still a great game for families or anyone else who’s looking for an uplifting change of pace." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "After a night {{spent in}} fever and sleeplessness, I {{forced myself to}} take a long tramp the next day through the hilly country, which was covered with pine woods. It all looked dreary and desolate, and I could not think what I should do there. Returning in the afternoon, I {{stretched}} myself, dead tired, on a hard couch, awaiting the long-desired hour of sleep. It did not come; but I fell into a kind of somnolent state, in which I suddenly <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were sinking in swiftly flowing water. The rushing sound formed itself in my brain into a musical sound, the chord of E flat; major, which continually re-echoed in broken forms; these broken chords seemed to be melodic passages of increasing motion, yet the pure triad of E flat; major never changed, but seemed by its continuance to impart infinite significance to the element in which I was sinking. I awoke in sudden terror from my doze, feeling as though the waves were rushing high above my head. I at once recognised that the orchestral overture to the Rheingold, which must long have lain latent within me, though it had been unable to find definite form, had at last been revealed to me." [...] (.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{a display}} of Parker's work ethic, work on the next Tame Impala album Lonerism had already started before Innerspeaker was even {{released}}. Lonerism was released on 5 October 2012 to widespread critical acclaim, winning many Album of the Year awards {{from the likes of}} NME Magazine, Rolling Stone Magazine and Triple J. Lonerism marks an extension of Parker's music, featuring synths and poppier melodies, and also a more lavish, lush and expansive sound. Commenting on the new-found sound, Parker said that [...] " [...] will be the kind of music that I <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> wanted to make during Innerspeaker, but I felt that it {{was too much of a}} jump. Back when I was doing Innerspeaker, I felt like I should make an album with only guitars, and use no synths, because I felt like it was a compromise to what we do. But I now know that it's not." [...] At the ARIA Music Awards of 2015 he won two trophies, Engineer of the Year and Producer of the Year, for his work on Tame Impala's Currents (July 2015); the group won three further categories at the ceremony: Album of the Year, Best Group and Best Rock Album.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2010 it was {{revealed}} that Billie would be killed from alcohol poisoning, leaving Carol devastated. Although Coulson felt Anderson's departure was premature, she praised the storyline's [...] "huge shock value". Coulson felt heartbroken when she was filming Billie's death scenes, of this she stated during an interview with Inside Soap: [...] "When we had to play the scene where Carol sees Billie lying dead in the living room, it was really sad - not just because a mum had lost her son in tragic circumstances, but also because <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was losing Devon too." ...|$|R
500|$|During free {{practice}} on Friday and Saturday, it was Lewis Hamilton and McLaren {{who set the}} pace, closely followed by championship contender Vettel and his Red Bull teammate Mark Webber. While Hamilton topped the time sheets in both Friday sessions, Jenson Button was quickest during the third session on Saturday morning. Fernando Alonso had a difficult first free practice, trailing Vettel by 0.465 seconds, {{twice as much as}} in previous races. However, he was able to lap faster than the German on the harder compound tyres in the second session. Ferrari looked stronger during the long run trials with Felipe Massa putting in the most consistently fast lap times, 0.1 seconds ahead of Hamilton. With high temperatures, tyre degradation was a concern for the teams in the paddock with Hamilton commenting that [...] "it <b>felt</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was sliding around the track with the tyres melting".|$|R
60|$|Hearing my footsteps, {{she faced}} about to greet me, or rather <b>as</b> <b>though</b> {{to see who}} it was that {{followed}} her. There {{she stood in the}} evening light, a bough of hawthorn bloom in her hand, and my heart beat yet more wildly at the sight of her. Never had she seemed fairer than as she stood thus in her white robe, a look of amaze upon her face and in her grey eyes, that was half real half feigned, and with the sunlight shifting on her auburn hair that showed beneath her little bonnet. Lily was no round-checked country maid with few beauties save those of health and youth, but a tall and shapely lady who had ripened early to her full grace and sweetness, and so it came about that though we were almost of an age, yet in her presence <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> always <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> were the younger. Thus in my love for her was mingled some touch of reverence.|$|R

"But it {{was clear}} to me that he was {{sleeping}} with one eye open, being generally in a suspicious and unchristian frame of mind, and that it was useless to proceed further on this stalk, so we quietly withdrew to consider the position and study the ground. The results were not satisfactory. There was absolutely no cover about except the ant-heap, which was some three hundred yards from the rhinoceros upon his up-wind side. I knew that if I tried to stalk him in front I should fail, and so I should if I attempted to do so from the further side--he or the birds would see me; so I came to a conclusion: I would go to the ant-heap, which would give him my wind, and instead of stalking him I would let him stalk me. It was a bold step, and one which I should never advise a hunter to take, but somehow <b>I</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>though</b> rhino and <b>I</b> must play the hand out.|$|R
2500|$|Woolf {{wrote about}} meeting Sackville-West in 1925: [...] "Vita shines in the grocer's shop in Sevenoaks...pink growing, grape clustered, pearl hung...There is her {{maturity}} and full-breastedness; her being so much full in sail {{on the high}} tides, where I am coasting down backwaters; her capacity I mean to take the floor in any company, to represent her country, to visit Chatsworth, to control silver, servants, chow dogs, her motherhood...her in short being (what I have never been) a real woman". [...] Sackville-West greatly admired Woolf's writings, declaring in a 1925 letter: [...] "My darling, last night I went to bed early and read Mrs. Dalloway-It was a very curious sensation: I thought {{you were in the}} room...I was very unhappy because I had a row with my mother and very happy because of you; so it felt like being two different people at the same time...I <b>felt</b> quite light, <b>as</b> <b>though</b> <b>I</b> was falling through my bed, like when one has a high fever. Today I am quite solid again and my boots are quite muddy. They weigh me down. Yet I am not solid as usual-not quite an oaf-because there is {{at the back of my}} mind all the time...a glow, a sort of nebula, which only when I examine it hardens into a shape; as soon as I think of something else it dissolves again, remaining there like the sun through a fog and I have to reach out again, to take it into my hands & feel its contours: then it hardens, [...] "Virginia is coming on Saturday!". Sackville-West considered Woolf to be the better writer, telling Woolf in one letter: [...] "I contrast my illiterate writing with your scholarly one, and <b>I</b> am ashamed". <b>Though</b> Woolf envied Sackville-West's ability to quickly turn out books compared to her laborious efforts to turn out a novel, she was inclined to agree with this assessment, writing in her diary that A Passenger to Tehran was written too much in haste as [...] "Vita's prose is too fluent". Before going on her second trip to Persia in 1927, a chastened Sackville-West, after receiving several letters from Woolf telling her not to churn out books, wrote to Woolf: [...] "I shall work so hard , partly to please you and partly to please myself...I treasure your sudden discourse on literature yesterday morning, a send-off to me, rather like Polonius to Laertes. It is quite true that you have had infinitely more influence on me intellectually than anyone else, and for this alone, I love you...You do like me to write well, don't you? And I do hate writing badly-and having written so badly in the past. But now, like Queen Victoria, I will be good".|$|R
