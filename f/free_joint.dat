40|$|Nonholonomic {{system is}} now one of major topics in robotics. In this paper, we discuss the {{nonlinear}} behavior of a two-joint planer manipulator with the second <b>joint</b> <b>free</b> for time-periodic inputs. First, we illustrate that when the amplitude remains small, the Poincar'e map of the system follows an ellipse-like closed path and it becomes chaotic with large amplitude. We, then, propose a control method to position the both joints via amplitude modulation of the position error. The effectiveness and robustness of the control method are verified by experiments. 1 Introduction Nonholonomic systems have the property that they can be controlled with less number of inputs than that of generalized coordinates. Oriolo and Nakamura[1] showed that the dynamical constraints of a manipulator with <b>free</b> <b>joints</b> are generally second-order nonholonomic.

40|$|AbstractBased on {{the analogy}} between {{bifurcation}} of equilibrium paths in structures and kinematic bifurcation of mechanisms, this paper proposes an analogous stiffness method to detect the singularity and kinematic bifurcation of mechanisms. The analogous stiffness in mechanisms is first defined as the derivative of the state variable {{with respect to the}} controlling variable. By investigating the value of analogous stiffness, the singularity can be classified into output singularity, input singularity and architectural singularity. And the kinematic characteristics of <b>free</b> <b>joints</b> at corresponding singularity configurations are expounded. The singular and kinematic bifurcation points of mechanisms can then be determined by solving analogous stiffness equations and compatibility equations simultaneously. Following that, the analytical criterion for finite motion of corresponding <b>free</b> <b>joints</b> at singularity configurations is derived from the second-order analysis of compatibility equations. The efficiency of the proposed method is finally illustrated by three typical examples...|$|R

A manipulator with <b>free</b> <b>joints</b> {{is one of}} such the systems and its control is difficult via ordinary nonlinear control methods. In this paper, we discuss control of free-joint manipulators whose first joint is only actuated {{and the others are}} <b>free</b> <b>joints.</b> We apply the averaging method to analysis of their behaviors in response to periodic motion of the first joint. We reveal an invariability of the averaged motion independent of the input-amplitude. We identify time-invariant manifolds of 2 R and 3 R free-joint manipulators and define the Hamiltonians of their averaged system. We propose a control method by amplitudemodulation to feedback the Hamiltonian. The method enables us to position the both joints of 2 R free-joint manipulator. The effectiveness of the method is verified by computer simulations. 1 Introduction Underactuated mechanism is a system whose number of control inputs is [...] ...|$|R

Although research has recently focused on these tendons' coactivity, their contributions in different tasks remain unclear. This study created a novel simultaneous approach to investigate the coactivity between the tendons and to clarify their contributions in different tasks. Ten human cadaveric hands were mounted on our custom frame with the FDS and FDP of the third finger looped through a mechanical pulley connected to a force transducer. Joint range of motion, tendon excursion and loading force were recorded during individual joint motion and <b>free</b> <b>joint</b> movement from rest to maximal flexion. Each flexor tendon's moment arm was then calculated. In individual motions, {{we found that the}} FDP contributed more than the FDS in proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint motion, with an overall slope of 1. 34 and all FDP-to-FDS excursion (P/S) ratios greater than 1. 0 with force increase. However, the FDP contributed less than the FDS in metacarpophalangeal (MCP) joint motion, with an overall slope of 0. 95 and P/S ratios smaller than 1. 0 throughout the whole motion except between 1. 9 % and 13. 1 % force. In <b>free</b> <b>joint</b> movement, the FDP played a greater role than the FDS, with an overall ratio of 1. 37 and all P/S ratios greater than 1. 0.

We prove that the explicit computation of the inverse-R-transform of a joint distribution is done via a formula of summation over the lattice of non-crossing partitions, which shows that theR-transform is the operator-theoretic counterpart of the “free cumulants” considered in the combinatorial approach of R.

These constructions can be understood as internal partitions, ceilings or external wall-/roof claddings. However, walls often consist of basic building materials and openings; such windows and doors as well as the acoustical properties of such structures are determined by both parts (e. g., a windows and the wall structure). The acoustical quality of opening is in general affected not only by the particular structure, but also by the concept of the mounting. Acoustical requirements should be applied in all its parts, such as the construction of the window (door) frame, window (door) wing and the realization of the functional gap as well as by application of a sealant.

Modern robotic systems are fully actuated with full information {{of themselves and}} their immediate surroundings.

A Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control system is proposed to allow an under actuated (damaged) robotic system (five-degrees-of-freedom, planar, biped, walking robot) to continue to follow a human-like walking gait in a series of Matlab and Simulink simulations. The proposed LQR controller keeps joint position errors to below 4 degrees for the fully actuated system, performing the entire gait within the given step time and length. The under actuated control system can match the fully actuated system using a separate LQR controller.

Our control al-gorithm takes into account communication constraints, obstacle avoidance, and inter-robot collision avoidance, by synthesizing a piecewise smooth vector field for safe navigation. First, the fea-sible <b>free</b> <b>joint</b> configuration space is tessellated into polytopes that account for the desired constraints. We search the graph of these polytopes to find a discrete path to the goal polytope. We then use a novel navigation function-based feedback controller that drives the system from one polytope to the next and eventually to the goal. The controller exploits the fact that two adjoining polytopes in the planned discrete path together form a star-shaped object that is obstacle free; this enables the design of navigation function-based controller for kinematic and dynamic fully actuated robots without spurious minima. We sequentially compose these controllers to drive the state to the goal. For a polygonal space, the algorithm we propose is complete. We present successful simulation results of the algorithm on a group of ground vehicles and quadrotors performing a cooperative navigation task in constrained environments. I...|$|E
