The culture was grown anaerobically using 250 mL conical flask containing guaiacol in the presence or the absence of fructose. Results showed that limiting fructose concentration for the highest cell growth was 2. 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1. It is also found that 94 % of guaiacol was transformed to catechol (0. 56 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1) when 2. 0 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 of fructose and 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 of guaiacol were used as carbon source for growth. In cultures containing 2 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 fructose (with addition of 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 guaiacol after 20 h incubation), the catechol production was 0. 5 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 (82 % transformation), while in cultures containing only guaiacol, the catechol production was 0. 4 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 (62 % transformation). In the experiment using harvested cells, the highest catechol production was 0. 47 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 (79 % transformation). The highest transformation was obtained using non-growing harvested cells from cultures containing 2 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 fructose with 0. 6 <b>g</b> <b>L</b> - 1 guaiacol addition suggesting that this is the best combination of carbon source for high production of catechol.

40|$|International audienceMineralogical and geochemical {{analyses}} of the environmental components {{in the vicinity of}} the abandoned mines of Jebel Hallouf-Sidi Bouaouane have shown that large volumes of flotation tailings are made of base metal sufides (galena, sphalerite, pyrite, marcasite) accompanied with lesser amounts of sulfosalts (jordanite, tennantite) and associated to a carbonated (calcite) and clayey (kaolinite, illite) matrix. Strong heavy metals (Pb, Zn and Cd) concentrations are recorded in soil and flotation tailings. Their concentrations in the flotation tailings are around 9250 mg. kg - 1, 8200 mg. kg - 1 and 66. 5 mg. kg - 1, respectively. Their mean concentrations in the soils surrounding the aforementioned mine wastes, are 39, 720 mg. kg - 1, 9030 mg. kg - 1 and 86 mg. kg - 1, respectively. Erosion by wind and running waters (heavy rain and flood periods) are considered as important mechanism in carrying these toxic elements to flood areas, and especially to soils lying on the eastern side of Jebel Hallouf Mountain. The statistical {{analyses of}} geochemical data relative to mine wastes and soils display a relationship between heavy metals and clay. Another relation is established between these metals and iron oxides. In soil, the µltivariate statistical approach [principal component analysis (PCA) ] has shown two contamination origins: the mining wastes and rock dumps (F 1 xF 2 diagram). Heavy metals concentrations in batch solutions of the contaminated soil samples varied between 36. 6 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 51. 2 51. 2 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for Pb, 543 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 3600 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for Zn and 0. 2 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 2. 5 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for Cd, while for the flotation tailings the concentrations varied between 16. 9 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 483 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1, 63 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 3240 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1, and 2 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 and 9. 8 µ <b>g.</b> <b>l</b> - 1 for the same elements respectively.

Partial least squares models were calibrated for the prediciton of cell dry weight (CDW), ethanol and consumed glucose, using the two data types separately. The low gravity cultivations (LGCs) {{consisted of two}} phases (glucose consumption with concomitant ethanol production followed by ethanol consumption after glucose depletion), which proved difficult to model using {{one and the same}} model for both phases. Segmented modelling, using different models for the two phases, improved the predictions significantly. The prediction models calibrated on standard on-line process data displayed similar or lower root mean square error of prediction (RMSEP) compared to the flourescence models.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Two novel dual-modal MRI/optical probes {{based on}} a rhodamine−DO 3 A {{conjugate}} have been prepared. The bis(aqua) gadolinium(III) complex <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 1 and mono(aqua) gadolinium(III) complex <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 2 behave as dual-modal imaging probes (r 1 = 8. 5 and 3. 8 mM − 1 s− 1 for <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 1 and <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 2, respectively; λex = 560 nm and λem = 580 nm for both complexes). The rhodamine fragment is pH-sensitive, and upon lowering of the pH, an increase in fluorescence intensity is observed as the spirolactam ring opens to give the highly fluorescent form of the molecule. The ligands are bimodal when coordinated to Tb(III) ions, inducing fluorescence from both the lanthanide center and the rhodamine fluorophore, on two independent time frames. Confocal imaging experiments were carried out to establish the localization of <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 2 in HEK 293 cells and primary mouse islet cells (∼ 70 % insulin-containing β cells). Colocalization with MitoTracker Green demonstrated <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 2 ’s ability to distinguish between tumor and healthy cells, with compartmentalization {{believed to be in}} the mitochondria. <b>Gd.</b> <b>L</b> 2 was also evaluated as an MRI probe for imaging of tumors in BALB/c nude mice bearing M 21 xenografts.

Yet the practical use of the <b>g.</b> <b>l.</b> b. has been severely hindered by sampling bias problems. It {{is well known that}} the <b>g.</b> <b>l.</b> b. based on small samples (even a sample of one thousand subjects is not generally enough) may severely overestimate the population value, and statistical treatment of the bias has been badly missing. The only results obtained so far are concerned with the asymptotic variance of the <b>g.</b> <b>l.</b> b. and of its numerator (the maximum possible error variance of a test), based on first order derivatives and the asumption of multivariate normality. The present paper extends these results by offering explicit expressions for the second order derivatives. This yields a closed form expression For the asymptotic bias of both the <b>g.</b> <b>l.</b> b, and its numerator, under the assumptions that the rank of the reduced covariance matrix is at or above the Ledermann bound, and that the nonnegativity constraints on the diagonal elements of the matrix of unique variances are inactive. It is also shown that, when the reduced rank is at its highest possible value (i. e., the number of variables minus one), the numerator of the <b>g.</b> <b>l.</b> b. is asymptotically unbiased, and the asymptotic bias of the <b>g.</b> <b>l.</b> b, is negative. The latter results are contrary to common belief, bur apply only to cases where the number of variables is small. The asymptotic results are illustrated by numerical examples...|$|R
