500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have got real empathy with Rachel." [...] However, Observer television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic: ...|$|E
500|$|A {{compilation}} of Orbison's most successful songs updated and re-recorded {{was released in}} 1987 under the title In Dreams: The Greatest Hits. It coincided {{with the release of}} the dark and surreal mystery thriller Blue Velvet, [...] directed by David Lynch. Orbison was astonished at the way Lynch used [...] "In Dreams". In the film, a murderous and morally bankrupt psychopath named Frank Booth (played by Dennis Hopper) is obsessed with the song and demands it be played over and over, calling it [...] "Candy Colored Clown". In one scene it is lip-synced by a flamboyantly effeminate character played by Dean Stockwell, after which Booth becomes enraged and beats the protagonist. Lynch later stated, [...] "it is a beautiful song and it was written by Roy... Those lyrics, that feel meant something to him. And it just so happened that a song in a certain situation could mean something else. And the way that Frank Booth used that song in two different places, it is just kind of unbelievable. But <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Roy was upset because for him it meant a third thing." ...|$|E
500|$|Jay Z {{assisted}} him in {{the production}} of what would become his debut album Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor. The title of the album is a reference to 'Food and Liquor' stores common in Chicago. He explains, [...] "The store is where everything is at...Food to me represents growth and progression. You eat food and you get strength. You need it to live. Liquor is not a necessity; it is a want. It destroys you. It breaks you down. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> it's prohibited in Islam...I've always felt like liquor represents the bad, the food represents the good, and everyone is made up of a little of both." [...] Lupe Fiasco's Food & Liquor was officially released on September 19, 2006. The album featured production from Jay-Z, Kanye West, Mike Shinoda, The Neptunes, Prolyfic, among others. The record spawned the singles [...] "Kick, Push", [...] "I Gotcha" [...] and [...] "Daydreamin'" [...] featuring Jill Scott. The critically lauded album was later nominated for three Grammy Awards including Best Rap Album. Fiasco won [...] "Best Urban/Alternative Performance" [...] for [...] "Daydreamin'". In the same year, he was voted by GQ magazine as the [...] "Breakout Man of the Year." [...] He also received four BET Hip Hop Award nominations, and it made it to number eight on Billboard 200 and number two on Billboard Top R/Hip-Hop Albums chart. That same year he participated in the first Cypher at the BET Hip-Hop Awards.|$|E

500|$|Star Cops was {{broadcast}} on Monday nights at around 8:30pm starting on 6 July 1987 on BBC2. Competition was provided on BBC One by sitcom Terry and June and The Nine O'Clock News. The fifth episode, [...] "This Case to be Opened in a Million Years", {{was broadcast}} at the later time of 9.55pm. The BBC listings magazine Radio Times promoted the series, {{giving it the}} front cover of the 4–10 July 1987 edition accompanied by a four-page article by Johnny Black inside. Star Cops performed poorly in the ratings with an average audience across the series of only 2.2million viewers. Chris Boucher has blamed the poor ratings on the timeslot the show was given, stating: [...] "There is nothing that has ever gone out on BBC 2 at half-past eight until twenty-past nine; it's a grotesque period. It doesn't synch with anything on BBC 1; it just doesn't work in relation to anything. You had to badly want to see Star Cops in order to watch it because you had to sacrifice {{at least two hours}} of viewing to see it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> people didn't want to have that problem.". He has also commented that the poor timeslot and the decision to air the series in July and August (a time when viewing figures are traditionally lower due to the summer) reflected the fact that Star Cops didn't have the confidence of the BBC management. This view is echoed by star David Calder who has described the timeslot as [...] "an act of sabotage and absurdity".|$|E
500|$|Andrew Hanson {{from the}} Los Angeles Times thought the [...] "premise {{was a little}} thinly {{stretched}} over the hour" [...] and believed {{it would have been}} overshadowed by stronger episodes in season one, but was glad to have another hour of Fringe regardless. SFScope contributor Sarah Stegall disliked that the network failed to issue a [...] "disclaimer" [...] about the episode's production date, stating [...] "...maybe the producers assume that all their audiences are brand new to the franchise. Or perhaps, unhappily, it is a sign that Fox has given up on this show, and no longer cares whether its lingering audience is confused." [...] She concluded, [...] "As a standalone episode, this one was of middling interest, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Fox would have dropped it from the Season One lineup. Fans looking eagerly for more 'mythology' episodes, where the links between the Fringe team, Massive Dynamics, Nina Sharpe, William Bell and, for all I know, the Illuminati are explored, may be disappointed." [...] Jane Boursaw of AOL TV was also critical of Fox for giving no warning about the episode and thought it should actually have been titled 'Walter vs. The Priest.'" [...] She continued, [...] "The whole episode was an interesting intersect between science and faith, not to mention the whole 'being possessed by a dead person because your brain waves crossed during life and death' thing. You can tell it was vintage Fringe -- if indeed it was -- because the storylines are more complex than that these days, what with the alternate universe and Leonard Nimoy and all." [...] Various critics noted guest actress Alice Kremelberg's performance, particularly when she had to give the impression she was possessed by a male ghost; most reviews were negative, though Boursaw praised it, giving Kremelberg [...] "high fives".|$|E

It {{takes you}} back to play-acting as a kid {{in your living room}} because you are running around and having to imagine that you are in Gantua and imagine that there are these weapons and all these giant things. But there's nothing when you are there other than {{styrofoam}} and blocks. It forces the actors to regress to when they would play-act as kids or do minimalist theatre. But in that way it's fascinating - <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> Robert Zemeckis and James Cameron have started to shoot pictures this way".|$|E

I realise from reading interviews with people like Ice Cube, when they explain that they're not talking about women in general but about particular women they know, {{it makes a lot of}} sense. I think the sound of the record is brilliant. I really like hardcore hip-hop and reggae stuff, so it's right up my flight of stairs." ...|$|E
2500|$|To {{the chagrin}} of long-time fans, the band waited until 2010 to perform live, despite having been {{together}} (as Shadow Gallery) since the early 1990s. When asked the question in one interview, Wehrkamp explained that [...] "We have always been more a studio band than a performing band unfortunately, and while we rehearsed for a tour just before Tyranny was started, a few obstacles blocked our touring options, and we were locked back in the studio to make another record. I know {{there are many people}} who cannot understand why we haven't played in support of this record, and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> they feel that way, but honestly, it's very difficult." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, the {{character}} was romantically paired with gangster Andy Hunter, played by Michael Higgs. In the storyline, Sam {{had been left}} {{in charge of the}} various Mitchell business and properties, and Andy, sensing an opportunity to gain control of these assets, proposed to Sam. According to Medcalf, Sam needed the marriage because she was [...] "vulnerable". She added, [...] "Andy is tough and she craves someone to look after her. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> she'd go for him; he's a good-looking guy, he's got money, he wears good clothes - he ticks every box." [...] 11 million viewers watched Sam marry Andy in September 2004. According to Medcalf, [...] "She knows that he's not desperately in love with her, but she thinks that it's enough. She's desperately in love with him. She's entering it very positively [...] Sam's not the brightest person, so she falls for his manipulations [...] I think she just wants to get the ring on her finger and then they can try to iron out any problems. She's a little naive." [...] The marriage lasted mere months on-screen; when Sam was conned into giving away all her family's properties, including her mother's public house (pub), The Queen Vic, Andy threw her out of their house.|$|E
2500|$|Hatton {{agreed to}} terms on 27 July for an 8 December 2007 welterweight fight with Floyd Mayweather Jr. which was {{considered}} to be the biggest welterweight fight since the 1999 clash between Oscar De La Hoya and Puerto Rican legend Tito Trinidad. The MGM Grand Garden Arena in Las Vegas was announced as the venue on 17 August 2007. The fight was agreed to less than three months after Mayweather had said he planned to retire following a victory over Oscar De La Hoya. Hatton was able to bring the fight to Mayweather in the early rounds. In the 1st round, Hatton caught Mayweather with a left jab which knocked Mayweather off balance. His constant pressure appeared to make Mayweather uncomfortable at first. In the third round, Mayweather landed a right that cut Hatton above the right eye. In round six, referee Joe Cortez took a point away from Hatton after he appeared to hit Mayweather {{on the back of the}} head while Mayweather was rested between the ropes. However, the punch was revealed to have hit the rope rather than Mayweather's head, but Hatton was warned for punching behind the head on numerous occasions before the deduction. Hatton became angry at the referee's decision to deduct a point and turned his back on him. Hatton later claimed he was angered by the referee, which caused him to lose his calm and contributed to his downfall. Hatton was able to hold his own until round eight, when Mayweather began to adapt to Hatton and started counterattacking. Mayweather knocked Hatton down to the mat in round ten. Hatton got up, but Mayweather quickly resumed his attack, resulting in Joe Cortez putting a stop to the fight and Hatton's corner threw in the towel. Mayweather commented post-match that [...] "Ricky Hatton is one tough fighter. He is still a champion in my eyes and I'd love to see him fight again... Ricky Hatton is probably one of toughest competitors I've faced. I hit him with some big ones but he kept coming and <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>see</b> <b>why</b> they call him the 'Hitman'."

[...] Schwartz nevertheless opined, [...] "...the symphony doesn't really grab me, although <b>I</b> <b>can</b> certainly <b>see</b> <b>why</b> so many admire it. For me, Albert's strategy of building up layers of activity combined with his penchant for low sonorities yields something one step up from mud." [...] Walter Price of the Los Angeles Times conversely praised the work, saying, [...] "Albert's 1985 Pulitzer Prize winning symphony, inspired by the works of James Joyce, is conservatively tonal, even Romantic. His style is eclectic though clearly the Stravinsky of 'Firebird' and 'Petrushka' have influenced him."
