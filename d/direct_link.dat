30|$|While {{the works}} in [2 – 5, 7] all {{considered}} minimizing the total transmit power of interference networks, another important performance metric, which concerns more {{about the quality of}} communications, is the mean-square-error (MSE) for signal estimation. In [8 – 10], the sum minimum MSE (MMSE) was considered to design iterative algorithms for MIMO interference relay systems taking the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> between the source and destination nodes into consideration, and in [11], similar problem has been considered ignoring the <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> between the communicating parties. Indeed the <b>direct</b> source-destination <b>links</b> can {{play a vital role in}} wireless communication systems when the link-strength is significant. However, multihop communication is motivated by the fact that such <b>direct</b> <b>links</b> may undergo deep shadowing effects in many practical scenarios. Hence, many existing works on multihop communications have ignored the <b>direct</b> <b>links.</b> Nonetheless, the sum MMSE criterion runs the risk that some of the receivers may suffer from unacceptably high MSEs.

Resinous Eucalyptus flavors tend to appear in regions that are habitats for the eucalyptus tree, such as California's Napa and Sonoma valleys and parts of Australia, but there has been no evidence to conclusively prove a <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> between proximity of eucalyptus trees and the presence of that flavor in the wine.|$|E

5|$|When {{rebel forces}} entered the palace, the Ngô {{brothers}} were not present, having escaped before to a loyalist shelter in Cholon. The brothers had kept {{in communication with}} the rebels through a <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> from the shelter to the palace, and misled them into believing {{that they were still}} in the palace. The Ngô brothers soon agreed to surrender and were promised safe exile; after being arrested, they were instead executed in the back of an armoured personnel carrier by ARVN officers on the journey back to military headquarters at Tân Sơn Nhứt Air Base. While no formal inquiry was conducted, the responsibility for the deaths of the Ngô brothers is commonly placed on Minh's bodyguard, Captain Nguyễn Văn Nhung, and on Major Dương Hiếu Nghĩa, both of whom guarded the brothers during the trip. Minh's army colleagues and US officials in Saigon agreed that Minh ordered the executions. They postulated various motives, including that the brothers had embarrassed Minh by fleeing the Gia Long Palace, and that the brothers were killed to prevent a later political comeback. The generals initially attempted to cover up the execution by suggesting that the brothers had committed suicide, but this was contradicted when photos of the Ngôs' corpses surfaced in the media.|$|E
5|$|When {{the forces}} of Yekuno Amlak (r. 1270–1285) toppled the Zagwe dynasty in 1270 {{he became the first}} Emperor of Ethiopia, {{establishing}} a line of rulers in the Solomonic dynasty that would last into the 20th century. By this time the Greek language, once pivotal for translation in Ethiopian literature, had become marginalized and mixed with Coptic and Arabic translations. This contributed to a process by which medieval Ethiopian historians created a new historiographic tradition largely divorced from the ancient Aksumite textual corpus. The Solomonic kings professed a <b>direct</b> <b>link</b> to the kings of Aksum and a lineage traced back to Solomon and the Queen of Sheba in the Hebrew Bible. These genealogical traditions formed the basis of the Kebra Nagast, a seminal work of Ethiopian literature and Ge'ez-language text originally compiled in Copto-Arabic sometime between the 10th and 13th centuries. Its current form dates to the 14th century, by which point it included detailed mythological and historical narratives relating to Ethiopia along with theological discourses on themes in the Old and New Testament. De Lorenzi compares the tome's mixture of Christian mythology with historical events to the legend of King Arthur that was greatly embellished by the Welsh cleric Geoffrey of Monmouth in his chronicle Historia Regum Britanniae of 1136. Although the Kebra Nagast indicates that the emperors of Rome or Constantinople and Ethiopia were descended from the Israelite king Solomon, there is an emphatically anti-Jewish sentiment expressed in several passages of the book.|$|E
