5|$|On {{sighting}} land, {{the crew}} persuaded the Malagasy {{that what they}} saw {{was a part of}} Madagascar the mutineers were unfamiliar with: after further subterfuge by the crew, the Malagasy set Meermin to drift towards the shore at Struisbaai. But the sea was rough, and one of the ship's masts was cut down to improve <b>her</b> <b>balance.</b> Meermin eventually grounded on a sandbank, by which time a militia consisting of local farmers and burghers had been formed onshore, who had observed that the ship was flying no flags, which they recognised as a distress signal. The militia killed or captured those of the Malagasy who ventured ashore, and then organised the removal into custody of all Malagasy remaining on the ship, under the command of a magistrate from Stellenbosch. Meermin was assessed as beyond recovery, and left to break up where she grounded.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{begins a}} {{relationship}} with Riley Costello (Rob Norbury). Riley's father, Carl (Paul Opacic), takes an instant disliking to Mercedes. This causes tension between Mercedes and Carl and they have sex. Carl and Mercedes begin an affair and Riley later proposes to Mercedes, which she accepts. Carl's son and Riley's brother, Seth (Miles Higson), discovers the affair and threatens to tell Riley. Mercedes tells Seth that he cannot reveal the affair because she is pregnant with Riley's child. She later tells Myra that she lied and is not pregnant. Myra tells Mercedes to fake a miscarriage, which she refuses to do. Mercedes attends an awards ceremony with Riley, where he becomes intoxicated. He accepts an award and attempts to get Mercedes onto the podium, but her high heel becomes trapped in the step. As Riley pulls her, she loses <b>her</b> <b>balance</b> and falls to the ground. Myra then declares that Mercedes is having a miscarriage. Mercedes is taken to hospital, where she is told that she is in fact twelve weeks pregnant. She explains to Myra that she is unsure of the child's paternity. On her wedding day to Riley, she reveals her affair with Carl. Riley's grandfather, Silas Blissett (Jeff Rawle), who is a serial killer, kidnaps Mercedes {{as a result of}} her behaviour and holds her captive in a basement, planning to kill her when the baby is born. While Mercedes is in the basement, Silas is arrested for four murders, leaving Mercedes trapped while she goes into labour. Lynsey asks Silas to tell them where Mercedes is, but he refuses. She taunts him until eventually he reveals her whereabouts. Riley finds Mercedes, who is about to give birth.

25|$|The video {{begins with}} Amy Lee {{dressed in a}} nightgown, barefoot and asleep in a bed within a building, dreaming of falling through the air below a skyscraper. As the chorus begins, the band and Paul McCoy are {{performing}} in another room as Lee awakens and makes {{her way to the}} window. Lee climbs out of the window and climbs the building with the wind blowing her hair and dress until she reaches the window of the room where the band is performing. During the bridge, McCoy notices Lee and opens the window, which causes her to lose <b>her</b> <b>balance,</b> and she grabs the ledge.

500|$|The Virgin {{holds an}} {{innovative}} and unusual position. She {{seems to be}} either rising or swooning as if having lost <b>her</b> <b>balance,</b> a divergence from her conventional seated or kneeling pose. Blum believes [...] "one may search in vain in other Netherlandish Annunciation panels {{of the fifteenth century}} of a Virgin positioned as she is here". Art historian Penny Jolly suggests the painting shows a birthing position, a motif van der Weyden experimented with in the Seven Sacraments Altarpiece, where the Virgin's collapse results in a childbirth-like posture, and with the Descent from the Cross, in which Mary Magdalen bends and crouches– similar to the position Memling's Magdalen assumes in his [...] Flanking the Virgin, and holding her, are two attendant angels. The one to the left lifts the Virgin's robe while the other gazes at the viewer, [...] "soliciting our response", according to Ainsworth. Both are small-statured, solemn, and according to Blum, in mood [...] "comparable to that of Gabriel." [...] Other than the presence of the angels, Memling shows a typical upper-merchant-class 15th-century Flemish bedchamber.|$|E
500|$|Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{returns from}} Outward Bound manager training—where {{he became more}} [...] "decisive and confident"—hoping for revenge on Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) for commandeering his job during the {{previous}} spring. To do this, Andy sets up a slackline {{in the parking lot}} and makes the employees walk across it, humiliating Nellie as she insists on walking in her heels and fails to keep <b>her</b> <b>balance.</b> After Clark proves that he is talented at balancing, Dwight attempts to one-up him, but ends up failing repeatedly and hurting himself. Eventually, Dwight tries to prove his superiority by riding a bicycle across a tight-rope suspended between the roof and a telephone pole, but the photocopier he is using as a counterweight is not heavy enough and he ends up losing his balance and hanging from the bicycle above the parking lot. Much to his embarrassment, he has to be rescued by a team of firefighters, while Creed Bratton (Creed Bratton) mistakenly believes the incident to be a circus act. While everyone is outside crowding around Dwight, Jim calls up his old college friend and tells him that he wants {{to be involved in the}} new business deal, even though he did not have Pam's approval.|$|E
500|$|Chastain next took on {{the lead}} role of a {{musician}} who is forced {{to care for her}} boyfriend's troubled nieces in the horror film Mama (2013). She was attracted to the idea of playing a woman drastically different from the [...] "perfect mother" [...] roles she had played in Take Shelter and The Tree of Life, and she based her character's look on the singer Alice Glass. The critic Richard Roeper noted how different the role was from the ones she had previously played, and considered it as proof of her being one of the best actors of her generation. During the film's opening weekend in North America, Chastain became the first performer in 15 years to have leading roles in the top two films (Mama and Zero Dark Thirty) at the box office. Mama eventually earned $146 million worldwide. She then starred as the titular character of a depressed woman who separates from her husband (played by James McAvoy) following a tragic incident in the drama The Disappearance of Eleanor Rigby (2013), which she also produced. The writer-director Ned Benson initially wrote the story from the perspective of Rigby's husband, then wrote a separate version from Rigby's perspective on the insistence of Chastain. The film premiered at the 2013 Toronto International Film Festival in two parts, Him and Her. A third part told from both their perspectivessubtitled Themwas released separately. The film did not find a wide audience, but the critic A. O. Scott praised Chastain for [...] "short-circuit conventional distinctions between tough and vulnerable, showing exquisite control even when her character is losing it, and keeping <b>her</b> <b>balance</b> even when the movie pitches and rolls toward melodrama".|$|E

The performance took on a boxing theme, and featured famous ring announcer Michael Buffer introducing Lopez to the stage.

[...] Close friend and American TV presenter Ryan Seacrest, agreed calling it [...] "the greatest recovery ever!" [...] According to MTV, [...] "the tumble was edited out of the West Coast feed of the show, out of respect for Lopez, by the show's producers". Becky Bain of 'Idolator' suggested that the tumble was more talked about than the actually single itself, which was confirmed when MTV reported {{that it was one of}} the most searched things on the internet. After the incident will.i.am praised Lopez for being a true entertainer. [...] "That shows she's a true entertainer and devoted, She came out of it and still rocked it.

I attacked her with proportional dividers, planimeter, rotameter, Simpson's rule, Froude's coefficients, Dixon Kemp's formulae, series, curves, differentials, and all the appliances of modern yacht designing, and she emerged from the ordeal a theoretically perfect boat. For when she is underway every element of resistance, stability, weight, heeling effort, and propulsive force is in one transverse plane, and that plane is the boat's midship section. I know of no similar case in the whole field of naval architecture, ancient or modern.” ...|$|E
