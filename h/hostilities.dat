40|$|Objective: To examine <b>hostility</b> {{measured}} {{in college and}} patterns of change in <b>hostility</b> from college to midlife as predictors of high health-related risk later in midlife. Methods: Logistic regression models were used to test hostility/risk associations. Results: College <b>hostility</b> predicted being a current smoker, consuming more than two drinks of alcohol, low social support, achieving less than expected in career and in relationships, risk for depression, and appraisal of life changing for the worse in terms of family events at midlife. Change in <b>hostility</b> did not predict smoking and drinking; however, it did significantly predict social isolation, lower income (only for women), obesity, avoidance of exercise, high-fat diet, and negative changes in economic life, work life, and physical health events–all risk indicators measured during the next decade. Appraisals of social support, lowered expectations, risk for depression, and reports of family life changing for the worse were predicted at both time periods. When change in <b>hostility</b> was modeled with college <b>hostility,</b> all risk indicators were significantly predicted by college <b>hostility.</b> Conclusions: High <b>hostility</b> in college and change in <b>hostility</b> from college to midlife predicts {{a full range of}} health risk indicators. When compared with the average population decline in <b>hostility,</b> gains in <b>hostility</b> at midlife are related to increased risk while declines in <b>hostility</b> are related to reduced risk. Higher midlife <b>hostility</b> is associated with increased odds of being in the higher risk group.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the role of <b>hostility</b> and {{direction}} of <b>hostility,</b> with particular emphasis on inwardly directed <b>hostility</b> in suicide attempt. The study proceeded by addressing the following issues: (a) relationship between inwardly directed <b>hostility</b> and suicide intent, (b) relationship between inwardly directed <b>hostility,</b> depression, and suicide intent, and (c) relationship between diagnosis, level of <b>hostility</b> and direction of <b>hostility.</b> The sample consisted of 100 participants who belonged to one of four groups: (a) inpatient suicide-attempters, (b) outpatient suicide-attempters, (c) inpatient depressives, and (d) non-clinical controls. All participants were assessed on the Gottschalk-Gleser Content Analysis Scales, <b>Hostility</b> and Direction of <b>Hostility</b> Questionnaire, and the Beck Depression Inventory. All suicide attempters were rated on a Suicide Intent Scale. Results indicated a strong positive relationship between inwardly directed <b>hostility</b> and suicide intent. This positive relationship remained even after controlling for the effects of depression. Similarly, inwardly directed <b>hostility</b> significantly predicted suicide intent scores beyond the combined effects of age, sex, social status, substance abuse, and depression. Measures of outwardly directed <b>hostility</b> such as, Criticism of Others and Extra-punitiveness scales, also correlated with Suicide Intent scores but in a negative direction. In comparison to non-attempter unipolar depressives, a subgroup of attempters diagnosed with personality disorder (borderline, antisocial, histrionic) were significantly more hostile, showed more extra-punitiveness and urge to act out <b>hostility,</b> and exhibited more overtly hostile verbal content, in spite of even higher depression scores. Younger age was associated with outwardly directed hostility: when controlled for age, differences in direction of <b>hostility</b> between the personality disordered attempters and non-attempter depressed groups disappeared. In the suicide-attempt group, the Beck Depression scores correlated positively with Suicide Intent scores, as well as with measures of outwardly and inwardly directed <b>hostility.</b> Similarly, in the comparison between suicide attempters and non-clinical controls Beck Depression scores showed a significant interaction with overall level of <b>hostility</b> and direction of <b>hostility.</b> The suicide-attempters were significantly more hostile and showed more inwardly directed <b>hostility</b> than the non-clinical group, however, when controlled for depression scores, differences on these <b>hostility</b> measures disappeared.

40|$|Troops {{returning}} from deployment may suffer adverse health outcomes including {{higher rates of}} mental distress and diagnosable mental illnesses such as Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Fortunately, not everyone who experiences traumatic events develops PTSD, indicating that other variables may influence the relationship between experiencing a traumatic event {{and the development of}} PTSD. One of the possible risk factors contributing to PTSD is <b>hostility.</b> Anger and <b>hostility</b> are personality traits that are associated with combat experience and are frequently observed in combat-related PTSD. In this prospective study the question arises whether <b>hostility</b> is a predictor for increased posttraumatic stress symptoms after deployment. The population of this study consists of military personnel who were deployed to Afghanistan as part of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF). <b>Hostility</b> was measured by the Cook-Medley <b>Hostility</b> scale before deployment, directly after and six months after deployment. Symptoms of PTSD were measured with the Self-rating Inventory for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder list directly after and six months after deployment. To investigate the assumptions several repeated measures Anova’s were used. Analyses of scores of PTSD-symptoms in a low and high <b>hostility</b> group indicated that the group of participants who were high in <b>hostility</b> before deployment reported significantly more PTSD-symptoms than participants who were low in <b>hostility</b> before deployment at all measurement points. No {{differences were found between the}} scores of PTSD-symptoms measured at all measurement points for the low <b>hostility</b> group. Therefore, the hypothesis that the low <b>hostility</b> group has less PTSD-symptoms six months after deployment compared to the high <b>hostility</b> group could be confirmed. There is no increase in <b>hostility</b> measured at all time points within the group of military personnel as a whole, indicating that <b>hostility</b> is a trait. It appears that pre-existing high <b>hostility</b> is a predictor for reporting more PTSD-symptoms compared to pre-existing low <b>hostility.</b> In this study there was no significant difference between the PTSD-symptoms reported before, directly after and six months after deployment by participants who were high hostile before deployment. This indicates that high hostile individuals report more PTSD-symptoms compared to low hostile individuals at all times. <b>Hostility</b> does not predict the development of PTSD-symptoms after deployment and therefore no causal relationship between <b>hostility</b> and PTSD can be drawn from this study. An explanation for this phenomenon could be found in a possible conceptual overlap between symptoms of PTSD and features of <b>hostility...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To {{explore the}} {{association}} between <b>hostility</b> and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) among coronary heart disease (CHD) patients, and whether these associations are mediated by sense of coherence (SOC). Background: Intervention {{research has shown that}} a decrease in levels of <b>hostility</b> leads to an increase of HRQoL among individuals with CHD. However, the mechanisms that link <b>hostility</b> and HRQoL in CHD patients are not clear. Methods: 509 CHD patients (mean age 58. 8 +/- 7. 3, 29. 3 % female) were examined. Results: <b>Hostility</b> was associated with poorer mental HRQoL. Adding SOC to the model weakened the strength of {{the association between}} <b>hostility</b> and mental HRQoL. The effect of <b>hostility</b> on mental HRQoL was explained for 61. 9 % by SOC. Neither <b>hostility</b> nor SOC was associated with physical HRQoL. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that low SOC may partially explain the adverse effect of <b>hostility</b> on low mental HRQoL in CHD patients. (C) 2016 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: We {{examined}} whether anger-in, anger-out, and <b>hostility</b> predicted symptom-specific muscle tension reactivity during anger induction (but not sadness induction) {{among patients}} with chronic low back pain (CLBP). For patients with CLBP, relevant muscles are the lower paraspinals (LPs). Anger-in <b>hostility</b> and anger-out <b>hostility</b> interactions were tested to determine whether particularly reactive groups of patients could be identified with a multivariable profile approach. Methods: Ninety-four patients with CLBP underwent anger recall (ARI) and sadness recall (SRI) interviews, whereas LP and trapezius electromyography and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded. They completed anger-in, anger-out, <b>hostility,</b> and trait anger measures. Results: Hierarchical regressions were used to test anger-in <b>hostility</b> and anger-out <b>hostility</b> interactions for physiological changes during the ARI and SRI. A significant anger-in <b>hostility</b> interaction was found for LP change during the ARI (but not SRI) such that high anger-in/high <b>hostility</b> patients evinced the greatest reactivity. Effects for trapezius reactivity were nonsignificant. Significant anger-in <b>hostility</b> interactions were also found for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure changes during the ARI such that high anger-in/low <b>hostility</b> patients showed the smallest changes. The anger-out <b>hostility</b> interaction for diastolic blood pressure change during ARI was also significant such that high anger-out/low <b>hostility</b> patients showed the smallest changes. All effects remained significant with trait anger controlled. Conclusions: A multivariable profile approach may help identify especially vulnerable patient groups. Patients with CLBP who tend to suppress anger and are cynically hostile {{may be more likely}} to experience high levels of muscle tension near the site of pain and injury durin...|$|R

BackgroundSome studies have found that hostile patients have an increased risk of incident IHD. However, no studies have compared methods of <b>hostility</b> assessment or considered important psychosocial and cardiovascular risk factors as confounders. Furthermore, it is unknown whether all expressions of <b>hostility</b> carry equal risk or whether certain manifestations are more cardiotoxic. MethodsWe assessed the independent relationship between baseline observed <b>hostility</b> and 10 -year incident IHD in 1, 749 adults of the population-based Canadian Nova Scotia Health Survey. ResultsThere were 149 (8. 5 %) incident IHD events (140 nonfatal, 9 fatal) during the 15, 295 person-years of observation (9. 74 events/ 1, 000 person-years). Participants with any observed <b>hostility</b> had a greater risk of incident IHD than those without (p = 0. 02); no such relation was found for patient-reported <b>hostility.</b> Those with any observed <b>hostility</b> had a significantly greater risk of incident IHD (hazard ratio: 2. 06, 95 % confidence interval: 1. 04 to 4. 08, p = 0. 04), after adjusting for cardiovascular (age, sex, Framingham Risk Score) and psychosocial (depression, positive affect, patient-reported <b>hostility,</b> and anger) risk factors.

40|$|Studies of the {{association}} between type A behavior and coronary heart disease have yielded inconsistent findings. A possible explanation for these inconsistent findings is that type A behavior is simply a marker for other behaviors that are truly related to coronary heart disease. <b>Hostility</b> is one such behavior that {{has been found in}} several recent studies to predict coronary heart disease and coronary atherosclerosis; however, several other studies have found null results.

40|$|<b>Hostility</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with heightened proinflammatory activity. However, it is not known whether greater <b>hostility</b> contributes to greater inflammation by promoting higher Th 1 activity, lower Th 2 activity, or both. The present study examines the relation of <b>hostility</b> to mitogen-stimulated Th 1 and Th 2 cytokine production in vitro. Participants were 193 healthy men and women (mean age 37. 3; 44 % non-white). <b>Hostility</b> was assessed with a 20 -item version of the Cook–Medley <b>Hostility</b> Scale (CMHS). PHA-stimulated interleukin (IL) - 2, tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α, and interferon (IFN) -γ were used to measure Th 1 activity; PHA-stimulated IL- 4, IL- 5, and IL- 10 were used to measure Th 2 activity. Greater <b>hostility</b> was related to greater production of two of the three Th 1 cytokines, TNF-α and IFN-γ. <b>Hostility</b> was not associated with any measure of Th 2 cytokine production. Associations with Th 1 cytokines were independent of age, sex, race, socioeconomic status, body mass index, depressive symptoms, and health-related behaviors, and were consistent across men and women. Associations were not explained by social network characteristics, social support, or personality traits closely associated with social behavior. Exploratory analyses substituting the CMHS cognitive, affective, and behavioral subscales for total <b>hostility</b> revealed that associations between <b>hostility</b> and Th 1 cytokine production were primarily driven by the cognitive component of <b>hostility</b> (i. e., cynicism). Results suggest that a unique dimension of <b>hostility,</b> particularly the cynicism subcomponent, that is unrelated to social factors, may influence inflammation by promoting greater Th 1 cytokine production. This effect on stimulated cytokine activity may have implications for a role of <b>hostility</b> in exacerbating immune-related disease...|$|R
