In November, Fischer played in the 1956 Eastern States Open Championship in Washington, D.C., tying for second with William Lombardy, Nicholas Rossolimo, and Arthur Feuerstein, with Hans Berliner taking first by a <b>half-point.</b>|$|E
25|$|McIlroy {{missed out}} on {{a chance to win}} the 2010 PGA Championship when he three-putted the 15th green to fall out of a tie for the lead. His final-hole birdie putt {{narrowly}} missed the hole to leave him one stroke out of the playoff between Bubba Watson and eventual winner Martin Kaymer. McIlroy finished tied for third. On 4 October 2010, McIlroy won a crucial <b>half-point</b> to help Europe regain the Ryder Cup.|$|E
25|$|Ferrari {{retained}} Lauda and Regazzoni's {{services for}} 1975 and the pair took six victories between them: five for Lauda, {{and one for}} Regazzoni at the 1975 Italian Grand Prix. Regazzoni also won his home Grand Prix, the non-championship Swiss Grand Prix, the only Swiss driver to have done so. Ferrari secured the Constructors' Championship, and Lauda won {{the first of his}} three World titles. Regazzoni finished fifth in the Drivers' Championship with 39.5points, the <b>half-point</b> coming at the 1975 Austrian Grand Prix, at which only half the race distance was completed due to heavy rain.|$|E

25|$|Despite his disappointments in the majors, Montgomerie is {{heralded as}} one of the {{greatest}} Ryder Cup players of all time. To date he has been a member of the European team on eight occasions, and has never lost in a singles match. He holds a win-lose-draw record of 20–9–7, thus giving him a total points scored tally of 23.5, only 1.5 points behind the all-time record held by Nick Faldo. He has played pivotal roles in several of the matches. He halved the last hole with Scott Hoch to obtain the <b>half-point</b> that won Europe the cup in 1997, and sank the winning putt, in what is considered to be his finest hour in the 2004 staging of the event.|$|E
25|$|India left Rio de Janeiro {{with only}} two medals, saving its pride from the humiliation of {{returning}} empty-handed {{for the first time}} since Barcelona 1992. These medals were awarded only to female athletes for the first time in history, a silver to badminton player P. V. Sindhu in the women's singles, and a bronze to freestyle wrestler Sakshi Malik in the women's 58 kg. Several Indian athletes came close to increasing the medal haul, including tennis tandem Mirza and Rohan Bopanna in the mixed doubles; Bindra, who narrowly missed out the podium by a <b>half-point</b> in the men's 10 m air rifle before retiring from the sport; and Karmakar, who surprised the global audience with her high-risk Produnova routine in the women's vault. For the first time, the Indian shooters failed to earn a single medal since 2000, and the boxers {{for the first time since}} 2004.|$|E
500|$|The final {{classification}} was a [...] "fair play" [...] ranking {{for each}} team. Teams were given penalty points for infringing various rules. These {{ranged from a}} <b>half-point</b> penalty for offences that merited a warning from the race officials to a 2000-point penalty for a positive doping test. The team that had the lowest points total {{at the end of}} the Giro won the classification. It was won by , who did not receive any penalty points during the Giro.|$|E

2500|$|Players {{are granted}} one point (1) for a win, a half (½) {{point for a}} draw, and no points (0) for a loss toward their tournament score, unless {{otherwise}} stated by the tournament director beforehand. Full-point byes are received when a player is excluded from a round because of an extra player. Thus, in tournaments with an odd number of players, a different player will receive a full-point each round. A full-point bye is equal in points to a normal win. <b>Half-point</b> byes can be requested by a player who will be unavailable for a round. If accepted, the player will receive a <b>half-point,</b> {{as if they had}} drawn the game. A player who wins by forfeit or default will also be granted one point. Players may use the following format to record the game score: ...|$|E
2500|$|The Hornets' most {{consistent}} state-level athletic success {{has come in}} wrestling, in which five students have won a total of seven individual state titles (Ralf Edwards and Gary Pierson in 1972, Ethan Harris in 2005, Danny Coyne in 2006, and a three-year unbeaten run by Steven Bradley from 1996 to 1998). The 1972 wrestling team endured the closest-ever runner-up finish in IHSAA wrestling history, ending up a <b>half-point</b> behind Bloomington. 60 Hornet wrestlers have qualified for the IHSAA State Finals (with several appearing two, three or four times), winning 55 placement medals. Also, in swimming, Andy McVey won two IHSAA individual titles in 1986, setting State records for that time; he had {{come back from a}} false-start disqualification in the 1985 finals, in which he had been favored to win. Andy won also this Herman F. Keller Mental Attitude Award.|$|E

2500|$|In 2011, the {{two schools}} created the Wagon Wheel Challenge, which counts all {{athletic}} contests in the 15 sports where they compete head-to-head. Through a sponsorship agreement with PNC Financial Services {{it is known}} as the [...] "PNC Wagon Wheel Challenge". Each sport is worth one point, awarded to the winning team. In sports with multiple meetings per season, whichever team wins the most games takes the full point. If the teams split the season's meetings, each school gets a <b>half-point.</b> For sports that only compete against each other as part of the conference championship meet, such as cross country, golf, and track and field, whichever team finishes higher in the championship meet is awarded the point. Games in the respective conference tournaments can also factor in to which school receives the point if the teams split their regular-season meetings, with the conference tournament meeting acting as a deciding game. Kent State took the first four seasons of the challenge, while the Zips claimed the overall challenge in 2015–16.|$|E

50|$|Due to {{completing}} {{less than}} half of the planned 120 lap race distance, <b>half-points</b> were awarded in the championships. Also, since most teams did not have time to perform their required driver changes before the race was stopped, all assigned drivers were assigned points even if they never made it into the car.|$|R
50|$|Points {{were awarded}} to the top eight {{finishers}} in the order 10-8-6-5-4-3-2-1 for 60 minute races, with double points awarded for the endurance races. <b>Half-points</b> were given in certain races of the G4 class, and in all GT Cup races {{due to a lack}} of entries.

50|$|The third race at the Norisring was red-flagged {{after half}} the race had been {{completed}} due to torrential rain. As a result, series organisers only awarded half points {{to each of the}} classified finishers eligible to score points. Similarly, <b>half-points</b> were awarded in the second race at Zandvoort, as only five laps were completed within the allotted time limit for racing.|$|R

Obviously, Ω ^(k)=∅ and Ω _j+ 1 ∪...∪Ω _k⊆Ω ^(j). Note that Ω ^(j) depends on p.|$|R
2500|$|The 7- and 8-point {{systems are}} favored, because a tie game {{can result in}} each team getting one point. (In a 4-point system, <b>half-points</b> would be {{required}} for ties.) Throughout {{the course of a}} season, each team will usually face all of the other teams in scheduled competition. [...] "Position Rounds", where 1st place bowls against 2nd place, 3rd place bowls against 4th place, and so on, are often added at one or more points during the season.|$|R
