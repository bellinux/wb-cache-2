25|$|When Warwick {{presented}} the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled The Rise of Robots {{in the year}} 2000, the lectures were well received by some. However, in a letter Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick, prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick is not a spokesman for our subject (Artificial Intelligence) and allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures is {{a danger to the}} public perception of science. Due to Warwick's claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Reader in Computational Creativity, also said the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have. Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> Warwick for his lectures.|$|E
500|$|... "Well I {{think we}} {{definitely}} {{wanted to speak}} to as many women as we could and all the pain and struggle that we go through as women to maintain this impossible standard of beauty. We wanted {{to give it a}} darker edge and take it there and not give you the Disney version of that struggle. And Beyoncé was more than willing to go that far with it. And <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> her for that." ...|$|E
500|$|... "It's {{all about}} {{promoting}} {{the benefits of}} healthy eating and exercise... But {{what we want to}} do is make it fun by doing something that we all love to do, and that's dance. I am excited to be part of this effort that addresses a public health crisis. First Lady Michelle Obama deserves credit for tackling this issue directly, and <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> the NAB Education Foundation for trying to make a positive difference in the lives of our schoolchildren." ...|$|E
6000|$|But she had {{forgotten}} poor Ransom's name, forgotten who had asked her for a card for him; and, perceiving it, he came to her rescue with the observation {{that he was a}} kind of cousin of Miss Olive's, if she didn't repudiate him, and that he knew what a tremendous partnership existed between the two young ladies. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> <b>I</b> was <b>applauding</b> the firm--that is, you too," [...] he said, smiling, to his kinswoman.|$|R

5000|$|Treviño and The Guardian {{responded by}} {{publishing}} a response in which Treviño stated that [...] "any reading of my tweet of 25 June 2011 that holds that <b>I</b> <b>applauded,</b> encouraged, or welcomed {{the death of}} fellow human beings, is wrong, and {{out of step with}} my life and record." [...] The Guardian later severed its relationship with Treviño, citing his previously undisclosed partnership with Malaysian business interests.|$|R
500|$|Case {{said she}} was unconcerned about the storyline because the writers had a plan to explain Sharon's behavior. New head writer Josh Griffith told TV Guide that the {{character}} would reach a [...] "total mental breakdown", which would {{take her to the}} edge and beyond before being rebuilt. Griffith said the breakdown would help her find salvation, with a [...] "stronger, more together, more evolved Sharon" [...] emerging. Sharon breaks down at the main house of the Newman ranch, burning it down while under the influence of alcohol. Griffith stated that the damage Sharon has done to the Newman family is [...] "physical, professional and emotional". After seeing a doctor, Sharon is diagnosed with bipolar disorder and begins treatment; however, she is alarmed after discovering she must take prescribed medication, possibly {{for the rest of her}} life. Case was happy with the outcome of the storyline, as were viewers of the show. In January 2013, she told Soap Opera Uncensored, [...] "When Sharon battled her emotional problems, that also took a lot of work but in a different way. Playing someone who is bipolar is very exhausting but it worked out perfectly and explained all of Sharon’s past behavior. <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> Josh for making that decision because I think it makes the most sense considering her history." [...] The actress in addition was pleased that she didn't have to continue justifying Sharon's questionable actions.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2011 interview, Harry {{said that}} [...] "After {{witnessing}} Elton John and his tireless efforts against HIV/AIDS", {{she had been}} inspired to put philanthropy as her top priority. She said, [...] "These things are important to my life now. I have the privilege {{of being able to}} get involved, so I do. <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> people like Elton John, who have used their position to do so much good." [...] Some of Harry's preferred charities include those devoted to fighting cancer and endometriosis.|$|E
2500|$|A non-musical {{highlight}} of the centennial celebration included a book-signing event by Woody Guthrie's sister, Mary Jo Guthrie Edgmon who published her new book [...] "Woody's Road: Woody Guthrie's Letters Home, Drawings, Photos and Other Unburied Treasures" [...] earlier in the month. Musician David Amram - who wrote the foreword to the book - was {{on hand for the}} book signing, along with co-author and Woody Guthrie historian, Guy Logsdon. At her annual pancake breakfast on Saturday morning, 89-year-old Edgmon said [...] "My voice is not so good anymore. I’m talking through brand-new false teeth. But <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> the people who came here to swelter, just for this little Okie." ...|$|E
6000|$|One night {{seeing that}} the {{principal}} of a well known School of Oratory was bulletined to lecture at the Young Men's Union upon [...] "The Philosophy of Expression" [...] I went to hear him, more by way of routine than with any expectation of being enlightened or even interested, but his very first words surprised and delighted me. His tone was positive, his phrases epigrammatic, and <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> heartily. [...] "Here {{is a man of}} thought," [...] I said.|$|R
60|$|There {{were other}} tombs in the valley, but the owners were dumb, except one Pharaoh, who {{from the highest}} motives had broken with the creeds and {{instincts}} of his country, and so had all but wrecked it. One of his discoveries was an artist, who saw men not on one plane but modelled full or three-quarter face, with limbs suited to their loads and postures. His vividly realised stuff leaped to the eye out of the acreage of low-relief in the old convention, and <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> as a properly brought-up tourist should.|$|R
40|$|Six years ago, I {{explained}} {{in these pages}} Why the President (Almost) Alvays Wins in Foreign Affairs. That article identified the recurrent patterns of executive activism, congressional passivity, and judicial tolerance that push Presidents successfully to press the limits of law in foreign affairs. Four years later, in Transnational Public Law Litigation, <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> the turn by private litigants to United States courts to promote the observance of international human rights norms by foreign and United States government officials. In the Haitian refugee litigation, the theses of these two articles collided, yet both, ironically, came true...|$|R
2500|$|After {{announcement}} of the planned rally, Brannon Howse, a professional organizer of Christian conferences, expressed wariness, stating [...] "The Apostle Paul warns Christians against uniting with unbelievers in spiritual endeavors. While <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> and agree with many of Glenn Beck's conservative and constitutional views, that does not give me or any other Bible-believing Christian justification to compromise Biblical truth by spiritually joining Beck." [...] Breakpoint's Diane Singer said, [...] "If you're like me and believe [...] have been deceived into following another Jesus, then perhaps you share my concerns. I want real revival to come to America, which means it {{must be based on}} Truth, not deception." [...] In response to the rally, Warren Cole Smith, associate publisher of the Christian-themed World magazine, said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Baudelaire, his {{publisher}} and the printer were successfully prosecuted for creating an offense against public morals. They were fined, but Baudelaire was not imprisoned. Six {{of the poems}} were suppressed, but printed later as Les Épaves (The Wrecks) (Brussels, 1866). Another edition of Les Fleurs du mal, without these poems, but with considerable additions, appeared in 1861. Many notables rallied behind Baudelaire and condemned the sentence. Victor Hugo wrote to him: [...] "Your fleurs du mal shine and dazzle like stars.... <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> your vigorous spirit with all my might." [...] Baudelaire did not appeal the judgment, but his fine was reduced. Nearly 100 years later, on May 11, 1949, Baudelaire was vindicated, the judgment officially reversed, and the six banned poems reinstated in France.|$|E
2500|$|Novelist Joanna Trollope commented in The Times that, [...] "This is not {{a matter}} of that age-old - and {{impossible}} - difficulty of the plagiarism of ideas. It is something much easier to define, and a danger to all writers. It is - let's not mince our words - the theft of someone's writing, someone's own words stolen in exactly the form in which their brain produced them. And it's a theft to which all writers are vulnerable. Jo Rowling didn't have to do this. I should think that her time in New York was horrible, exacerbated by a lack of support caused, no doubt, by deeply unattractive sourness over her wealth. Well, <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> her, and I bet I'm not alone. I am thrilled for her, and very grateful to her, for taking the stand she did - and winning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So am I," [...] said Valentin to Newman. [...] "The marquis and I are charmed. I can't marry, myself, but I can {{understand}} it. I can't stand on my head, but <b>I</b> can <b>applaud</b> a clever acrobat. My dear sister, I bless your union." ...|$|R

[856:1] It was {{pleasing}} to observe, during the Rehearsal all the Actors and Actresses {{and even the}} Mechanics on the stage clustering round while these lines were repeating just {{as if it had}} been a favourite strain of Music. But from want of depth and volume of voice in Rae, they did not produce an equal effect on the Public till after the Publication--and then they (<b>I</b> understand) were <b>applauded.</b> <b>I</b> have never seen the Piece since the first Night. S. T. C.|$|R
2500|$|Linguist George Lakoff {{argued that}} the [...] "ad has raised vital {{questions}} that need a thorough and open discussion. The ad worked brilliantly to reveal, via its framing, an essential but previously hidden truth: the Bush Administration and its active supporters have betrayed {{the trust of the}} troops and the American people." [...] Liberal blogger Arianna Huffington argued that [...] "Was the MoveOn ad blunt? Yes. Did it go for the ? No doubt. But while the way it chose to make its points can be debated, the accuracy of those points cannot." [...] Anti-war activist and Congressional candidate Cindy Sheehan stated that [...] "I have often been critical of MoveOn.org, basically because I feel, for the most part that they support Democrats to the detriment of democracy... The occupation of Iraq is a disaster and <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> MoveOn for moving a little closer to the true 'anti-war' movement and encourage them to come with us farther." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{cartoonist}} visited John Lennon and Yoko Ono {{at their}} 1969 Bed-In for Peace in Montreal, and their testy exchange later {{appeared in the}} documentary film [...] (1988). Introducing himself with the words [...] "I'm a dreadful Neanderthal fascist. How do you do?," [...] Capp sardonically congratulated Lennon and Ono on their [...] nude album cover: [...] "I think that everybody owes {{it to the world}} to prove they have pubic hair. You've done it, and I tell you that <b>I</b> <b>applaud</b> you for it." [...] Following this exchange, Capp insulted Ono ("Good God, you've gotta live with that?"), and is asked to [...] "get out" [...] by Derek Taylor. Lennon allowed him to stay however, but the conversation had soured considerably. On Capp's exit, Lennon sang an impromptu version of his Ballad of John and Yoko song with a slightly revised, but nonetheless prophetic lyric: [...] "Christ, you know it ain't easy / You know how hard it can be / The way things are goin' / They're gonna crucify Capp! [...] " ...|$|E

60|$|I had flattered myself, at first, {{with the}} idea that all this fiery indignation {{on the part of the}} {{community}} was merely the overflowing of their zeal for good old English manners and their horror of innovation, and <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> the silent contempt they were so vociferous in expressing for upstart pride, French fashions and the Miss Lambs. But I grieve to say that I soon perceived the infection had taken hold, and that my neighbors, after condemning, were beginning to follow their example. I overheard my landlady importuning her husband to let their daughters have one quarter at French and music, and that they might take a few lessons in quadrille. I even saw, in the course of a few Sundays, no less than five French bonnets, precisely like those of the Miss Lambs, parading about Little Britain.|$|R
5000|$|... (Ep. 4) Jonathon Allen {{comes out}} as gay to his masters, Don and Carolyn Heinz, after feeling {{depressed}} and outcast {{for much of}} the project. He later comes out publicly at Sabbath and feels greatly relieved. However, Jeff Wyers takes a dark view of the news and is clearly displeased. He says [...] "Jonathon came out in a church setting. It seemed like a somewhat strange time and place. Some people <b>applauded...</b> <b>I</b> didn't <b>applaud.</b> All men have sin... one step toward God... is seeking help. We must learn to master ourselves. Not pat each other on the back." [...] However, Governor Wyers chooses not to punish Jonathon, although the Puritan punishment for homosexuality was death.|$|R
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> this determination, but doubted {{whether he}} meant to carry it out. However, I {{conducted}} him to the back room, where he sat himself {{down on the edge}} of my four-poster, and after conversing a little longer on the subject of Mr. Jackson (who seemed to have gotten upon his brain), he toppled over and instantly fell asleep with his clothes on. For a while I stood over him, the old affection welling up so strongly within me that my eyes were dimmed as I looked upon his face. Spare and handsome it was, and boyish still, the weaker lines emphasized in its relaxation. Would that relentless spirit with which he had been born make him, too, a wanderer forever? And was it not the strangest of fates which had impelled him to join this madcap expedition of this other man I loved, George Rogers Clark? ...|$|R
6000|$|Raab Kiuprili. The bad man's cunning still {{prepares the}} way [...] For its own outwitting. <b>I</b> <b>applaud,</b> Ragozzi! [...] Ragozzi! <b>I</b> <b>applaud,</b> [...] In thee, the virtuous hope that dares look onward [...] And keeps the life-spark warm of future action [...] 120 [...] Beneath {{the cloak of}} patient sufferance. [...] Act and appear, as time and {{prudence}} prompt thee: [...] I shall not misconceive the part thou playest. [...] Mine is an easier part--to brave the usurper.|$|E

60|$|Before I fell asleep, I {{had some}} farther {{discourse}} with the captain, {{who seemed to}} put great confidence in me. He referred to our previous conversation of the morning; {{told me he was}} weary of his hazardous profession; that he had acquired sufficient property, and was anxious to return to the world and lead a peaceful life in the bosom of his family. He wished to know whether it was not in my power to procure him a passport for the United States of America. <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> his good intentions, and promised to do everything in my power to promote its success. We then parted for the night. I stretched myself upon my couch of moss, which, after my fatigues, felt like a bed of down, and sheltered by the robber's mantle from all humidity, I slept soundly without waking, until the signal to arise.|$|R

60|$|That bare-armed, thin-shirted idiot, {{leaning out}} of the cab, took the stationmaster's orders as an insult to his dignity, and roared at the shut offices: 'You'll give me what-for, will you?

She starts with a jerk that nearly smashes the couplings, and runs, barking like a dog, till she is out of sight. Nor does she think about spilled people and parted families on the platform behind her. I had to do all that. There was a man called Fred, and his wife Harriet--a cheery, full-blooded couple--who interested me immensely before they battered their way into a small detached building, already densely occupied. There was also a nameless bachelor who sat under a half-opened umbrella and twirled it dizzily, which was so new a game that <b>I</b> <b>applauded</b> aloud.|$|R
