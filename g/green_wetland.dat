Metallothioneins (MT) are involved in heavy metal tolerance, homeostasis, and detoxification of intracellular metal ions in plants. In {{order to understand the}} mechanism of heavy metal uptake in Aegiceras corniculatum, we isolated its metallothionein gene and studied the MT gene expression in response to heavy metals contamination. Here, we report the isolation and characterization of MT 2 genes from young stem tissues of A. corniculatum growing in the cadmium (Cd) and lead (Pb) polluted wetlands of Quanzhou Bay, southeast of China. The obtained cDNA sequence of MT is 512 bp in length, and it has an open reading frame encoding 79 amino acid residues with a molecular weight of 7. 92 kDa and the theoretical isoelectric point of 4. 55. The amino acids include 14 cysteine residues and 14 glycine residues. It is a non-transmembrane hydrophilic protein. Sequence and homology analysis showed the MT protein sequence shared more than 60 % homology with other plant type 2 MT-like protein genes. The results suggested that the expression level of MT gene of A. corniculatum young stems induced by a certain range concentration of Cd 2 + and Pb 2 + stresses (0. 2 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 +, 1 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 +, 0. 2 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 +, and 40 mu mmol L- 1 Cd 2 +; 1 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 + and 40 mu mol L- 1 Cd 2 +) compared with control might show an adaptive protection. The expression levels of MT gene at 20 h stress treatment were higher than those at 480 h stress treatment. The expression levels of MT gene with 0. 2 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 + stress treatment were higher than those with 0. 2 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 + and 40 mu mol L- 1 Cd 2 + stress treatment, and the MT gene expression levels with 1 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 + treatment were higher than those with 1 mmol L- 1 Pb 2 + and 40 mu mol L- 1 Cd 2 + treatment. There exists an antagonistic action between Pb 2 + and Cd 2 + in the MT metabolization of A. corniculatum...|$|E

This study aims to compare the satellite images of Istanbul, Sarıyer which have different resolution and varying dates after pixel-based and object-oriented classification methods are performed. For this purpose, three different satellite images of Sarıyer area from the years 2004, 2010 and 2011,from Ikonos 2, Spot 5 and Landsat 5 (TM) satellites were utilized. Pixel-based supervised classification process was performed on the all satellite images and object-oriented classification process was performed on only the Ikonos 2 satellite image. For testing to increase the accuracy of classification, supervised classification with samples obtained from object-based classification process was performed on all of the images. After classification processes, accuracy analysis was performed. Pixel-based and object-oriented classifications were performed by using Erdas- 9. 1 and eCognitiondeveloper- 8 software packages and four different classes were achieved.

40|$|The National Water Quality Inventory of 1998 stated {{over fifty}} percent of America’s {{impaired}} waterways are affected by urban/suburban stormwater runoff (EPA, 2000). Stormwater management is typically treated in conventional ways that may be inefficient over time and contribute to negative issues, such as flooding, pollution, and environmental degradation. Value exists in design that moves from the norm of creating common open and closed drainage systems for managing stormwater, to design that utilizes elements such as bioswales, rain gardens, sustainable ponding, <b>green</b> roof technology, <b>wetlands,</b> and vegetation {{as a means to}} improve stormwater management. The project site is located in the city of North Olmsted, Ohio, where development of impervious surfaces has caused issues associated with stormwater and flooding. The design site is distinguished by North Olmsted’s close economic and physical relationship with Cleveland, placement in the Rocky River watershed, and its proximity to and Metropark system. The project design incorporates bioswales, rain gardens, sustainable ponding, <b>green</b> roof technology, <b>wetlands,</b> and vegetation into the existing Great Northern Mall site. These design elements, along with courtyards and parking structures, are integrated to function together as a larger system. Although negative effects may have taken place in the built environment, it is possible to improve an existing situation of a site and in turn the surrounding region. Stormwater treatment with sustainable Best Management Practices, although functional, can provide a site with a sense of place and promote pride and interest in once negatively associated areas.

We analyze these interventions as examples of “value articulation”, which we view as a relational and sociomaterial practice that requires the enrolment of people, plants, and things that together perform, spread, and deploy stories about why given places need protection. For each case study, we also highlight the moments when narrative practices move beyond mere protection and start to change the very context in which they were developed. We refer to these as projective narratives, emphasizing how novel values and uses are projected onto these spaces, opening them up for reworking. Our analyses of these successful attempts to protect land demonstrate how values emerge as part of inclusive, yet specific, narratives that mobilize and broaden support and constituencies. By constructing spatial linkages, such narratives embed places in wider geographical ‘wholes’ and we observe how the physical landscape itself becomes an active narrative element. In contrast to rationalist and external frameworks for analyzing values in relation to urban natures (e. g., ecosystem services), our ‘bottom-up’ mode situates urban nature in specific contexts, helping us to profoundly rethink planning and practice in order to (i) challenge expert categories and city/nature dichotomies; (ii) provide vernacular ways of knowing/understanding; and (iii) rethink the role of urban designers...|$|R

40|$|Climate change impacts {{increase}} {{pressure on}} challenges to sustainability and the developmental needs of cities. Conventional, “hard” adaptation measures are {{often associated with}} high costs, inflexibility and conflicting interests related to the dense urban fabric, and ecosystem-based adaptation (EbA) {{has emerged as a}} potentially cost-efficient, comprehensive, and multifunctional approach. This paper reviews and systematises research on urban EbA. We propose an analytical framework that draws on theory from ecosystem services, climate change adaptation and sustainability science. It conceptualises EbA in terms of five linked components: ecological structures, ecological functions, adaptation benefits, valuation, and ecosystem management practices. Our review identified 110 articles, reporting on 112 cities, and analysed them using both quantitative statistical and qualitative content analysis. We found that EbA research in an urban context is fragmented due to different disciplinary approaches and concepts. Most articles focus on heat or flooding, and the most studied ecological structures for reducing the risk of such hazards are <b>green</b> space, <b>wetlands,</b> trees and parks. EbA is usually evaluated in bio-geophysical terms and the use of economic or social valuations are rare. While most articles do not mention specific practices for managing ecological structures, those that do imply that urban EbA strategies are increasingly being integrated into institutional structures. Few articles considered issues of equity or stakeholder participation in EbA. We identified the following challenges for future EbA research. First, while the large amount of data generated by isolated case studies contributes to systems knowledge, {{there is a lack of}} systems perspectives that position EbA in relation to the wider socio-economic and bio-geophysical context. Second, normative and ethical aspects of EbA require more thought, such as who are the winners and losers, especially in relation to processes that put people at risk from climate-related hazards. Third, there is room for more forward-looking EbA research, including consideration of future scenarios, experimentation in the creation of new ecological structures and the role of EbA in transformative adaptation...|$|R

This pa-per shows a logic methodology to develop an indicator system – through the re-search, from literature review to modern concept; it shows clearly the factors that are important to build a sustainable city. The indicator system was derived and compared with other existing systems. The comparison showed that the indicator system we developed for the city is operational and integrated with a consistent hierarchy.

40|$|A {{main stream}} postulation in urban {{planning}} is that denser cities enhance {{energy efficiency and}} city attractiveness by offering shorter travel distances {{and a variety of}} functions that reduce car traffic and facilitate walking, biking and public transit. However, the complex links that exist between city density and its implications for energy efficiency and city attractiveness call for {{a better understanding of the}} factors that influence an integrated planning of regional cities. In this context, one factor that could be of interest to study is that of green urban open spaces such as <b>green</b> wedges, parks, <b>wetland</b> areas, shore lines, gardens, cemeteries, golf courses and treed boulevards that provide protection for biodiversity as well as many other valuable ecosystem services. However, discussions on developing compact, energy efficient and attractive regional cities are raising conflicts with policies that aim at conserving green urban open spaces. The aim of this paper is to increase knowledge on and contribute to the development of strategies and measures to best manage the conflicts that are emerging between developing dense, low traffic cities and planning for good quality, valuable and accessible green urban open spaces. To achieve this aim, a conflict mapping exercise is being carried out by identifying, reviewing and assessing literature on the subject. In parallel, relevant examples are being analyzed and seminars, workshops and interviews are taking place with actors of the Stockholm city region. Obtained results are conflicting perceptions on the role that green urban open spaces should play in city development, conflicts of governance and collaboration, conflicts between different objectives at varying decision making scales, and significant limitations to integrated and systemic socio-ecological understandings of the city region and its changing values. The conflict mapping exercise is a valuable starting point to identify the proposal of alternative land use practices, discuss how these can be assessed, and define measures that can enhance compactness, energy efficiency and green qualities in city region planning and development.

40|$|As Grand Valley State University (GVSU) {{was built}} and {{expanded}} in Allendale, Michigan, the negative {{impacts of the}} campus stormwater discharge on the ravines also grew. It {{was not until the}} early 2000 ’s that GVSU began to understand the impacts stormwater had on the ravines. In 2011, 32 acres of stormwater drainage from the west side of campus was diverted to a series of constructed wetlands. Prior to this change, a biological baseline was determined by Snyder et al (2008) by sampling the macroinvertebrates in the Little Mac stream (Snyder et al 2008). The purpose of this project was to examine the series of campus events that resulted in the degradation of the ravine streams and to compare new macroinvertebrate data to the set collected in 2008 for signs of change since the reduction flow in stormwater to the ravines. Chapter One of this report discusses the major changes to the GVSU Allendale campus that impacted stormwater. The Allendale campus was constructed on farm fields near the Grand River in 1960. The first buildings were completed in 1964 and GVSU continued building and expanding since then. The area of impervious surface went from zero acres in 1960 to over 170 acres now, and the university continues to add new buildings to accommodate the growing student population. The stormwater management practices shifted from subsurface pipes draining directly to the ravines in the beginning to the implementation of practices, such as rain gardens, <b>green</b> roofs, and <b>wetlands,</b> to reduce stormwater runoff and utilize it for irrigation on campus beginning in 2007. In Chapter Two, I discuss the results of macroinvertebrate samples collected in the Little Mac stream and the control stream in 2013. The results for the Little Mac stream were compared to samples collected by Snyder et al (2008). The comparison of the macroinvertebrates sampled in 2013 and 2008 showed that overall the changes were insignificant. However, some of the changes indicated the stream was beginning to stabilize and allow areas of soft sediment accumulation, which were not previously present. The comparison with the control stream samples revealed that the Little Mac stream is more degraded than the stream without urban impairments. This supports the idea that GVSU needs more restoration efforts to improve the water and habitat quality of the Little Mac stream. Chapter Three presents the project conclusions, management implications of the results, and recommended restoration activities. Additional research priorities also are presented. Since GVSU controls the entire watershed of the ravines, it will be easier for the University to continue working at the watershed scale to manage stormwater. Additional practices that should be explored include stream bed restoration, use of plants for stream bank stabilization wherever possible, and construction of wetlands within the ravine to aid with flow control and contaminant filtration...|$|R
