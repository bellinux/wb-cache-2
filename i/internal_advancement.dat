40|$|Compared {{with the}} total number of farmers engaged in organic farming in Austria, the number of people {{concerned}} with biodynamic farming is rather small. – So, what are the underlying motives and values of farmers for biodynamic cultivation? What is the farmers’ anthroposophical approach to the method? And how do these farmers assess the present situation as well as future developments in the field of organic farming? On the basis of qualitative research a number of semi-structured interviews with countrymen and -women from ten different farms located in Lower Austria were conducted. The interviews were carried out by means of an interview guide and exclusively addressed people engaged in biodynamic farming. As to the motives for biodynamic farming for example, ecological aspects, <b>internal</b> <b>advancement</b> and the effective implementation of the method were in the foreground. As regards personal values, independence and self-determination, family and personal advancement as well as taking on responsibility seem to be important. ...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{is intended to}} {{provide insight into the}} impact of large scale organisational change on the psychological contracts of the three main employee groupings present in the South African workplace. This study is important in that it seeks to assess whether organisational change moderates or reinforces differences among the three social identities, namely Africans; Coloureds, Indians and White females (the so-called “middle group”); and White males. Within the context of large scale organisational change, this research showed significant differences among the social identities with respect to perceptions of the employer’s obligation to them and vice versa, loyalty to the organisation, opportunities for <b>internal</b> <b>advancement,</b> performance of duties beyond the normal scope for work, employment security, intent to leave the organisation and job satisfaction. Owing to the presence of distinct social groupings in the workplace, organisational change management strategies that differentiate between the groups to address their specific concerns are required to embed and sustain organisational changes and to create a unified culture, with which all demographic groupings can affiliate, to enhance a sense of belonging.

40|$|This Article {{analyzes}} the institutional and political factors deterring prosecutors from accepting the possible legitimacy of post-conviction innocence claims and formulating creative responses to them. Specifically, the institutional culture of most prosecutors 2 ̆ 7 offices treasures convictions; an attorney 2 ̆ 7 s conviction rate {{may serve as}} a barometer of that person 2 ̆ 7 s stature within the organization and a key factor in determining that person 2 ̆ 7 s chances for <b>internal</b> <b>advancement.</b> This professional incentive for prosecutors to obtain and maintain convictions may be bolstered by profound psychological and personal bases for believing in the soundness of the verdicts and pragmatic reasons for discounting the possibility that there may be some creditable claims within the heap of post-conviction filings. Likewise, there are a series of political incentives for prosecutors to resist post-conviction innocence claims, even potentially meritorious ones, with zeal. Candidates vying for the office of chief prosecutor typically campaign on a general tough-on-crime platform, strewn with references to their overall win-loss record and reminders about specific successes in high-profile cases. Appearing 2 ̆ 2 soft 2 ̆ 2 on criminals, such as by accepting the possible validity of a prisoner 2 ̆ 7 s innocence claim, detracts from that tough-on-crime rhetoric and is largely anathema to prosecutors. The major exceptions to this general rule are when political considerations suggest that openness to the innocence claim may be advantageous, which is of little consolation to the prisoner whose claim happens to surface {{at a time when the}} political stars are not so perfectly aligned. This Article concludes by mentioning a series of potential reforms designed to help rehabilitate the ideal that prosecutors are obliged to do justice in the post-conviction arena...|$|E

The increase in capacity of both the AB/Life Technologies SOLiD 4. 0 and Illumina HiSeq instrumentation {{and the ability of}} the platforms to multiplex samples has led to process innovations impacting many ongoing projects at the HGSC. Applications have ranged from regional and whole exome capture sequencing to the use of whole genome shotgun for deep coverage and determining structural rearrangements. <b>Internal</b> <b>advancements</b> have complemented the higher capacity instrumentation through the implementation of library automation, low DNA input samples, capture hybridization multiplexing and application of read mapping tools such as BFAST and BWA. Development of sample intake procedures, LIMS tracking and defined reporting metrics has enabled NexGen sequencing pipelines that can effectively deliver targeted and whole genome shotgun data for thousands of samples. These technical advancements to the pipeline have allowed us to achieve a rate of ∼ 1500 libraries/captures per month. To date the center has completed over 5000 exome and regional capture libraries for The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA), NIMH Autism, Cohorts for Heart and Aging Research in Genomic Epidemiology (CHARGE-S) and 1000 Genomes Project. Development of these applications and methods will be discussed along with key data metrics, process management and pipeline organization...|$|R

30|$|The {{criteria}} for identifying key partners in industry and academia {{should be comprised}} of several important aspects. The project team should include access to scientific and technical expertise {{in a number of}} areas including developmental biology, stem cell differentiation, cell production, and process development including quality assurance and quality control. From the medical side it is important to bring in experts and key-opinion-leaders in the disease area that is being targeted in order to have in-depth understanding of the disease mechanisms and pathology, and also knowledge of the currently available treatments, if there are any. Other important competencies to include are from clinical development and the regulatory side. Based on the recent advent of this field, the experience from hPSC-based therapeutic applications is today limited both from the clinical- as well as from the regulatory aspects. This makes it important to follow the developments closely and having the opportunity to adapt quickly to any alterations in the clinical and regulatory landscape that may arise. It is expected that adjustments of the program need to be done as the developments progress. Thus, it is critical that the project team is highly flexible and can adapt to new conditions, both based on <b>internal</b> <b>advancements</b> but also based on possible changes in the external environment and regulatory landscape. For example, it was recently highlighted that most of the hESC lines listed on the NIH Stem Cell Registry do not comply with US Food and Drug Administration’s requirements for commercializable starting material for medicinal products[7]. Notably, this is due to the restricted use of NIH funds for the derivation and use of hESC lines which is not compatible with the FDA regulations for biologically generated therapeutic products for human use. In Europe, the situation is similar, and funds from the European Commission cannot be used for the derivation of new hESC lines, which will be needed in order to bring hESC-based therapies to the market. Thus, research programs relying on such federal- and international grants are currently facing substantial regulatory hurdles and these issues must be resolved. Investments in product development and commercialization using non-FDA approved hESC-lines seem unlikely from the industry side since these efforts may need to be repeated using a starting material that fulfils the FDA regulations.|$|R
40|$|Existing {{literature}} {{on the status of}} the field of China geography has been focused either on what has been written on or the <b>internal</b> <b>advancement</b> of knowledge in the field, without considering its relationship to the broader social context and academic environment. In this study I adopt a contextual approach to analyzing two interrelated issues: (1) the changing position held by China geography in the grand geographic discipline; and (2) the evolution of discourses formulated by China geographers as a result of interactions with the broader academic environment. A systematic survey of research papers published in leading international journals has placed China geography in a peripheral position, with a volume of research output disproportionate to the size and importance of the nation. Nevertheless, several encouraging trends are observed, including the dramatic growth of research output since the 1990 s and the broadening of the field beyond physical geography to encompass human geography and urban studies. A narrative investigation of the professional experience of a leading China geographer reveals a process of discourse (re) construction conditioned by both the changing political economy of China and the shifting emphases in the geographic discipline. Four periods of discourse formation are identified in this case study, namely the conception of the Chinese city as the center of change in the 1970 s, interpretation of the uniqueness of Chinese urbanism in the 1980 s, modeling of spontaneous town-based urbanization and regional development in the 1990 s, and, most recently, the use of the notions of space, place, and transnationalism to construct the Chinese diaspora as a geographic system. Discourse formation in China geography can be understood as the consequence both of the rapidly changing material conditions in China and of discursive practices in the geographic discipline. Much needs to be done by China geographers to go beyond the empirical arena of area studies and become more actively engaged in the ongoing theoretical debates in the mainstream of geography and China studies. ...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the extent to which {{institutional}} norms determine attributes of internal audit practices and how institutional changes explain the development of these practices. Design/methodology/approach – The authors employed a qualitative research approach based on archival analysis and interview evidence. Findings – Findings indicate that regulation-based institutional norms explain the adoption of internal audit and the function’s characteristics in Ethiopian organizations. Furthermore, innovative introduction of internal audit practices originate within individual organizations and eventually get institutionalized through diffusion. Such innovations are associated with organizational size, top management characteristics, <b>internal</b> audit <b>advancement</b> in technology, and exogenous input from the external environment. Widely accepted internal audit practices, as institutional norms, are not always taken-for-granted at the level of individual organizations. The institutional change perspective enables explaining how new internal audit approaches are introduced to supplant old ones. Originality/value – This study theorizes the development of internal audit practices from an institutional change perspective. Being the first study to do so, it contributes to the understanding of key drivers of institutional change that initiate newinstitutional norms that foster the development of internal audit through introduction and diffusion of new audit practices as old ones are deinstitutionalized. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{explored}} {{solutions to}} the issue of burnout and retention of Extension agents. Extension agents experience burnout for reasons such as long hours, stress, and organizational factors. As Extension administration addresses job satisfaction and performance of Extension employees, burnout and retention issues identified in this study can facilitate efforts to enhance the effectiveness of a statewide Extension program. Herzberg’s Motivation-Hygiene Theory was the theoretical framework for this study. Researchers used the constant-comparative method of analysis to identify recurring themes from the open-ended items of an online-administered survey. Twelve primary themes emerged, including (a) compensation, (b) hiring practices, (c) promotion and advancement within Extension, (d) organizational support regarding agent development, (e) organizational support regarding administration, (f) organizational support regarding colleagues, (g) reporting, (h) recognition, (i) resources, (j) personnel and staffing, (k) evaluation of administration and specialists, and (l) workload. Results suggest that Extension administration should focus on the maintenance factors of compensation, workload, and <b>internal</b> promotion and <b>advancement,</b> as well as motivating factors, to improve retention of Extension agents...|$|R
40|$|As {{a country}} of Southern European mentality Italy may be taken as the nearest-to-the-Balkans model of the gender {{equality}} mechanisms and necessity of their existence. Italy also might {{be taken as a}} model of domain and methods of functioning of the gender equality mechanisms as well as their connections with the EU development funds. Besides the Italian Ministry for Rights and Equal opportunities and the National Committee, the attention was paid to the whole range of local mechanisms and legal regulations dealing with advancement of women’s employment and counteracting discrimination on the labor market. In the text are analyzed through the five chapters the Italian mechanisms/institutions for gender equality as located within the European institutional environment but also within the context of Italian recent history of struggle against gender based discrimination. It was stressed that the essence of the accumulated European institutional wisdom is in diversity of the gender equality bodies rather then in their uniformity. Although the Italian mechanisms for gender equality are part of the European institutional environment their aim is to meet the <b>internal</b> needs for <b>advancement</b> of gender equality. Besides, the mechanisms also meet the demands of the international standards comprised in the documents issued by the UN and the EU. In European countries these mechanisms are frequently established and function in the domains of the labor and employment regulations, but also are located within the human rights portfolios while somewhere are connected with the minority rights and equal opportunity implementation...|$|R
40|$|The {{relation}} between an employer and an isolated employee or worker is typically a {{relation between}} a bearer {{of power and}} one {{who is not a}} bearer of power. In its inception it is an act of submission, in its operation it is a condition of subordination, however much the submission and the subordination may be concealed by the indispensable figment of the legal mind known as the 2 ̆ 7 contract of employment 2 ̆ 7. ” Otto Kahn-Freund, Labour and the Law (London: Stevens, 1977). This study examines the legal evolution of the common law of employment contracts in Ontario between the 1890 s and the 1970 s. It focuses on the changing relationship between notions of property and contract in employment, as visible through the judicial discourse of reported common law cases. I argue that between the 1890 s {{and the end of the}} 1970 s Ontario saw the emergence and consolidation of two different conceptual paradigms for regulating work at common law. The common law of employment contracts was framed and reframed over different eras of the 20 th century through what the courts understood of the nature of the exchange between the parties, the property interests involved and the legal tools necessary to manage that exchange. Contrary to the traditional narrative in the field, the courts of Ontario first conceptualized employment as an exchange as of the turn of the 20 th century. This first paradigm emerged in tandem with the province’s second industrial revolution, and sought to regulate the discretionary nature of white collar professional work. The second paradigm was entrenched in the 1960 s and 1970 s. It is over these years that workers in Standard Employment Relationships (SER) first began to bring employment-related claims to the common law courts, a few decades after it emerged as the paradigmatic form of work around which Ontario’s labour market and employment laws were fashioned over the mid-century. The basic premises of the SER, of long-term employment, job security and <b>internal</b> career <b>advancement,</b> fundamentally changed the psychosical and economic terms of employment. But faced with workers’ claims for recognition of these new terms in law, the courts instead chose to entrench a limited legal framework which denied job security as an enforceable contract term...|$|R
40|$|The aim was {{to conduct}} a {{long-term}} follow-up study on the function and sensitivity of the mandible in advancement and setback patients after bilateral sagittal split osteotomy (BSSO) with rigid <b>internal</b> fixation. The <b>advancement</b> and setback groups consisted of 16 (12 females and 4 males, mean age: 21. 4 and 21. 3 years, respectively) and 17 (11 females and 6 males, mean age: 27. 1 and 27. 7 years, respectively). The final follow-up was a mean of 12. 7 years (T 4) post-operatively. The other follow-up examinations were before surgery (T 1) and 7. 3 / 6. 6 (T 2) and 13. 9 / 14. 4 (T 3) months after surgery. To evaluate craniomandibular function, mouth-opening capacity, laterotrusion, protrusion, deviations during opening, pain and clicking of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ), muscular pain, and the retruded contact position-intercuspal position (RC-IP) distance were examined. A questionnaire was used to record subjective reports. The neurosensory status was determined with two-point discrimination (2 -pd), the pointed, blunt, and light-touch tests. Statistical analysis included the following tests: Wilcoxon signed ranked matched pairs, Mann-Whitney U, paired t, and Fisher's exact test. Bonferroni's adjustments were made for evaluation of the questionnaire and Spearman's rank correlation coefficients to determine the interdependence of selected variables. Craniomandibular function showed restitution at T 4 after 12. 7 years. The 2 -pd at the lip and chin had largely normalized {{in the two groups}} at T 3. At T 4, there was a significant increase of 2 -pd at the lip and chin in both groups. The discrimination between sharp and blunt was limited in both groups in 25 per cent of patients at T 4. Dysfunctions such as TMJ clicking, bruxism, and pain in the TMJ and muscles were neither increased nor decreased after BSSO. The initial post-surgical neurosensory impairment was barely detectable 1 year post-surgery. The new neurosensory impairment manifested at T 4 was probably due to the normal human process of ageing. Neither age, gender, surgical advancement, nor setback showed any significant correlation...|$|R
