50|$|It's {{the story}} of a fastidious king Balbir Singh (Ashok Kumar) of Himmatpur whose stern, high handed {{behaviour}} leads to a breakdown in communication with his four children; eldest daughter Hemalata (Nanda), younger daughter Ashalata (Tanuja) and sons Pratap (Rohit Kumar) and Rajendra (Deven Verma). His intimidating commands lead to a partial paralysis of Hemlata's lower limbs as also a simmering discontent amongst other descendants. After numerous attempts fail to cure Hemalata, the king hires a new doctor Sanjay (Sunil Dutt) who, contrary to expectations, is not just young and handsome but also against silly protocols that hamper laughter, fun and frolic. <b>Dr.</b> <b>Sanjay's</b> experimentations provide greater mobility and joy to youngsters, giving them fresh lease of life and a much needed voice of rebellion. Transcending normal barriers of doctor-client confidentiality, Sanjay and Hemalata fall in love and the romance enables her to walk in double quick time on her feet!Initially reluctant, the king awakens to a new dawn of freedom and humbly accepts not just their relationship but also Ashalata's betrothal to social activist (Soodesh Kumar), who defeats him in a general election.|$|R

40|$|The {{periosteum}} contains mesenchymal progenitors {{required for}} bone repair. The signaling pathways regulating periosteal response to fracture are largely unknown. Phosphatidylinositol- 3 Kinase (PI 3 K) is a lipid kinase activated by various signaling pathways. Cbl, an E 3 ubiquitin ligase and major adaptor protein, can modulate PI 3 K activity. Substitution of tyrosine 737 to phenylalanine (YF) in Cbl abolishes interaction between Cbl and PI 3 K. Previously, <b>Dr.</b> <b>Sanjay’s</b> lab showed that YF mice displayed increased bone volume under homeostatic conditions {{and formed a}} larger bony callus during fracture repair. The goal {{of this study was}} to further investigate the role of PI 3 K signaling upon initiation of fracture healing. Here we present evidence that absence of PI 3 K regulation by Cbl leads to robust periosteal thickening with increased proliferation of periosteal cells. YF periosteal progenitors also showed augmented osteogenic differentiation. Our studies revealed that increased stability and nuclear localization of Osterix observed in YF periosteal cells may explain this enhanced osteogenic differentiation since expression of Osterix transcriptional target genes is increased. The impact of aberrant PI 3 K signaling on macrophages and osteoclast precursors (OCPs) in fractured periosteum is not well unexplored. Recent studies have highlighted important functions for macrophages and OCPs in regulating bone formation and osteogenic differentiation. Here we analyzed the effect of PI 3 K activity modulation by Cbl on macrophages and/or OCPs upon initiation of fracture healing. We found increased myeloid precursors in YF bone marrow (BM) and periosteum and observed an enhanced responsiveness to M-CSF signaling in BM macrophages (BMMs). We developed a novel technique for culturing periosteum derived macrophages (POMs) which may be utilized to better understand their interaction with periosteal osteoprogenitors. Histological analysis of fractured femurs revealed an increase in myeloid lineage cells in expanded YF periosteum upon bone injury. Further analysis of these cells is required to delineate the macrophage and OCP populations present. Overall, our findings highlight a novel role for Cbl and PI 3 K in modulating the periosteal osteogenic and myeloid response during early stages of fracture repair. Detailed understanding of cellular and molecular mechanisms regulating skeletal repair is essential to identify targets and create new tools to improve bone repair...|$|R

Of these, 114 days were spent on the consideration of the draft Constitution. On 29 August 1947, the Constituent Assembly set up a Drafting Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr. B.R. Ambedkar to prepare a draft Constitution for India. While deliberating upon the draft Constitution, the assembly moved, discussed and disposed {{of as many as}} 2,473 amendments {{out of a total of}} 7,635 tabled. <b>Dr</b> B.R.

There were more than 30 members of the scheduled classes. Frank Anthony represented the Anglo-Indian community, and the Parsis were represented by H. P. Modi. The Chairman of the Minorities Committee was Harendra Coomar Mookerjee, a distinguished Christian who represented all Christians other than Anglo-Indians. Ari Bahadur Gurung represented the Gorkha Community. Prominent jurists like Alladi Krishnaswamy Iyer, Benegal Narsing Rau and K. M. Munshi, Ganesh Mavlankar were also members of the Assembly.
