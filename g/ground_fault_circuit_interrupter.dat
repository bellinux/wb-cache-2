40|$|The Structural Mechanics and Dynamics Branch at the NASA Glenn Research Center has {{developed}} a three-axis high-temperature magnetic bearing suspension rig to enhance {{the safety of the}} bearing system up to 1000 F. This test rig can accommodate thrust and radial bearings up to a 22. 84 cm (9 in.) diameter with a maximum axial loading of 22. 25 kN (5000 lb) and a maximum radial loading up to 4. 45 kN (1000 lb). The test facility was set up to test magnetic bearings under high-temperature (1100 F) and high-speed (20, 000 rpm) conditions. The magnetic bearing is located at the center of gravity of the rotor between two high-temperature grease-packed mechanical ball bearings. The drive-end duplex angular contact ball bearing, which is in full contact, acts as a moment release and provides axial stability. The outboard end ball bearing has a 0. 015 -in. radial clearance between the rotor to act as a backup bearing and to compensate for axial thermal expansion. There is a 0. 020 -in. radial air gap between the stator pole and the rotor. The stator was wrapped with three 1 -kW band heaters to create a localized hot section; the mechanical ball bearings were outside this section. Eight threaded rods supported the stator. These incorporated a plunger and Bellville washers to compensate for radial thermal expansion and provide rotor-to-stator alignment. The stator was instrumented with thermocouples and a current sensor for each coil. Eight air-cooled position sensors were mounted outside the hot section to monitor the rotor. Another sensor monitored this rotation of the outboard backup bearing. <b>Ground</b> <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>interrupts</b> were incorporated into all power amplifier loops for personnel safety. All instrumentation was monitored and recorded on a LabView-based data acquisition system. Currently, this 12 -pole heteropolar magnetic bearing has 13 thermal cycles and over 26 hr of operation at 1000 F...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} {{technical report}} describes {{the development and}} testing of an arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>interrupter</b> (AFCI) for DC circuits operating primarily at 48 volts. We have identified an effective method for determining when arcing is occurring. Our method is primarily based on comparing the frequency spectrum of current flowing through the circuit during an arcing event to a known characteristic spectrum. Once an arc has been identified, our interrupter is capable of responding adequately to eliminate the arc. Hardware tests show the AFCI developed in this thesis responded, in all test cases, within 2 seconds of an arc fault occurrence. Commercialization and adoption of our interrupter will increase the safety of DC circuits operating at 80 volts or less...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to ascertain the capabilities and limitations of the <b>Ground</b> <b>Fault</b> <b>Circuit</b> Interrupters (GFCI). A GFCI is an electrical device which is designed to protect people from electric shock. GFCI protection devices are installed as per current requirements, including all wet areas that may have potential for electrical shock. The GFCI continually matches the amount of current going to an electrical device against the amount of current returning from the device along the electrical path. It senses small imbalances in the circuit in the range of approximately 5 mA and turns off all power by tripping a delay circuit in the GFCI within 36. 3 s and thereby protecting the load. The most efficient trip times are found 123. 2 s and 155. 1 s which will also protect the load very safely...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Photovoltaic (PV) {{systems have}} caused {{residential}} and commercial building fires when an electrical arc fault initiates in the conduction path. Article 690. 11 in the United States 2011 National Electrical Code requires new photovoltaic systems on or penetrating a building to include a listed arc fault protection device to prevent additional fires. In response, manufacturers are creating arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> interrupters (AFCIs) using electrical frequencies for detection, but their operation is not fully characterized. Sandia National Labs has undergone a major effort to identify detection difficulties and establish tests for PV AFCI manufacturers to ensure their product can robustly detect arcing conditions while avoiding false trips from noise sources. In previous studies, arc fault signatures have been compared to string noise and frequency-dependant attenuation through PV modules has been quantified. In this paper, a frequency response analyzer {{was used to measure}} radio frequency (RF) propagation through arrays of varying irradiance and size. Irradiance did not affect module frequency response, but the length of unshielded wiring significantly affected the frequency response of the system above 100 kHz due to RF effects. Based on the RF affects in PV systems, it is recommended that arc <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>interrupter</b> manufacturers select detection frequencies below 100 kHz...|$|R

40|$|Circuit Breakers have {{historically}} been the preferred protection for aerospace wiring. Present designs are based on technologies that are 40 years old.

Proprietary Arc-fault technology from Square D has been adapted to detect parallel or line to neutral arcs by listening for the unique signatures which arcs generate.

They are also required in dormitory units. AFCI receptacles look similar to GFCI receptacles in that they have a TEST and RESET button {{on the face of the}} device for localized testing. This saves a homeowner a trip to the breaker panel should the device trip. Unlike AFCI breakers, AFCI receptacles can be used on any wiring system, regardless of the panel. When installed as the first receptacle on a branch circuit, AFCI receptacles provide series arc protection for the entire branch circuit.

A good ground filter/notch filter will prevent a feedback loop up case ground which causes false alarms. Also surge suppression improperly installed inside a fire alarm panel will also cause a feedback loop up case ground and cause false alarms. So the surge suppression must be outside the box, in a plastic box and not grounded directly to the fire panel, rather the grounded to the ground side/line side of the in-line series three stage two tank circuit designed AC surge suppression. Parallel will not protect a fire alarm panel nor prevent false alarms. In series surge suppression will at least help one control where the surges are coming from and the ground filter will also help. Tie three to four knots in the low voltage wire between the low voltage surge suppress and the fire alarm panel, and tie at least one knot in the phase/neutral/and ground wire attached to the power supply. This will help mitigate false alarms, as well as help one's surge suppression do a better job.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Photovoltaic arc faults {{have led}} to a number of rooftop fires that have caused {{significant}} property damage and threatened the safety of building occupants. In response, Article 690. 11 was added to the United States 2011 National Electrical Code, requiring new PV systems on or penetrating a building to include a listed arc fault protection device. Many proposed arc fault detectors utilize frequency content on the PV string to remotely determine if an arc fault is occurring. A frequency response analyzer was used to measure the AC frequency and impedance response of an 80 W polycrystalline module with degradation similar to those which have caused arc fault. The module had intermittent electrical connectivity in the junction box because of a failed solder bond, {{and the quality of the}} connection could be manipulated by adjusting the external wire orientation. By reorienting the wire, the impedance profile changed and the frequency response transitioned between high-pass, low-pass, and no filtering behavior. This indicated (1) certain module conditions can filter arc fault noise frequencies, and (2) the frequency response or impedance spectroscopy of PV components could be used to identify conditions that cause arc faults in PV systems. The implications for the former are serious because if the detection frequencies used by the <b>fault</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>interrupter</b> (AFCI) are sufficiently filtered, the device will not trip and the arc will not be extinguished. Finally, infrared images were taken of the intermittent module to identify the area of damage and corroborate the impedance spectroscopy results...|$|R
