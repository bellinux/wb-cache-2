25|$|Double {{ionization}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> {{formation of}} doubly charged ions when laser radiation is exerted on neutral atoms or molecules.

25|$|If {{the goal}} of shorter-term therapy is for {{patients}} {{to understand that they}} are not the way they appear to be and can act differently, then the longer-term goal of working through is for patients to understand who and what they are as human beings, what they truly are like and what they truly contain. The goal of working through is not achieved by the patient’s sudden discovery of a hidden, fully formed talented and creative self living inside, but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> slowly freeing oneself from the confinement of abandonment depression in order to uncover a potential. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> experimentation with the spontaneous, nonreactive elements that can be experienced in relationship with others.|$|E

25|$|In genetic algorithms, {{crossover}} is {{a genetic}} operator used to vary the programming of a chromosome or chromosomes {{from one generation}} to the next. It is analogous to reproduction and biological crossover, upon which genetic algorithms are based. Crossover <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> taking more than one parent solution and producing a child solution from them. There are methods for selection of the chromosomes. Those are also given below.|$|E

25|$|For {{context of}} comparison, in {{supersonic}} flows, additional increased expansion may {{be achieved through}} an expansion fan, {{also known as a}} Prandtl-Meyer expansion fan. Moreover, the accompanying expansion wave may approach and eventually collide and recombine with the shock wave, which <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> destructive interference. Thus the sonic boom associated with the passage of a supersonic aircraft is a type of sound wave produced by constructive interference.|$|E
25|$|The chips {{were also}} liked for their undervolting ability. Undervolting <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> {{determining}} the lowest voltage {{at which a}} CPU can remain stable at a given clock speed. As Athlon XP-M CPUs were already rated running lower voltages than their desktop siblings, it was a better starting point for lowering voltage even further. A popular application was use in home theater PC systems due to high performance and low heat output resultant from low Vcore settings.|$|E
25|$|Partitioning <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> {{dividing}} the chip into small blocks. This is done mainly to separate different functional blocks {{and also to}} make placement and routing easier. Partitioning {{can be done in}} the RTL design phase when the design engineer partitions the entire design into sub-blocks and then proceeds to design each module. These modules are linked together in the main module called the TOP LEVEL module. This kind of partitioning is commonly referred to as Logical Partitioning.|$|E

25|$|Under Communism, the Hungarian {{minority}} {{issue was}} confined invariably {{to the position}} of Slovaks within the Czechoslovak state, and therefore it was ignored in any systematic way. But the fall of Communism reinforced national identities and demolished the ideology of 'the socialist unity of nations'. The break-up <b>of</b> Czechoslovakia <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> national redefinition and assertion in Slovakia.|$|R

25|$|Development {{geography}} is {{a branch of}} geography which refers to {{the standard of living}} and its quality of life of its human inhabitants. In this context, development <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> change that affects people's lives. It may involve an improvement in the quality of life as perceived by the people undergoing change. However, development is not always a positive process. Gunder Frank commented on the global economic forces that lead to the development of underdevelopment. This is covered in his dependency theory.|$|E
25|$|Irenaeus' {{emphasis}} on the unity of God is reflected in his corresponding {{emphasis on}} the unity of salvation history. Irenaeus repeatedly insists that God began the world and has been overseeing it ever since this creative act; everything that has happened {{is part of his}} plan for humanity. The essence of this plan <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> maturation: Irenaeus believes that humanity was created immature, and God intended his creatures {{to take a long time}} to grow into or assume the divine likeness.|$|E

The undertone of sadness and the themes of death and loss that flow through her children's books have been criticised by some reviewers, but Williams always maintained that hearts acquire greater humanity through pain and adversity. She wrote that life <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>process</b> <b>of</b> constant change—there are departures for some and arrivals for others—and the process allows us to grow and persevere.|$|E
