40|$|A {{postal survey}} {{was carried out}} in June and July 1980 to find out if there was any {{relationship}} between smoking habits of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and their reported intervention against smoking among their patients. Responses from 342 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in London and Kent indicated that there was a relationship: <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> who smoked cigarettes (13 per cent of the sample) were less likely to advise or help their patients to stop smoking than <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> who smoked a pipe or cigars or who did not smoke at all.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{examine the}} {{concerns}} of singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> working in an inner London area and to compare the views of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in partnerships. DESIGN [...] Qualitative analysis of semistructured interviews with {{a random sample of}} singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and a sample of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> from partnerships matched for age and sex. SETTING [...] The area covered by Lambeth, Southwark, and Lewisham Family Health Services Authority. RESULTS [...] The singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> {{were more likely to be}} older, male, and first qualified abroad than <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in partnerships. Their major concerns were inadequate premises, maintaining their singlehanded status, and coping with recent changes to their contract. Most were very satisfied with their solo status and did not see the provision of 24 hour care as stressful. CONCLUSION [...] Singlehanded <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> saw themselves as providing a unique service for patients, and their status as an alternative for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> who were unhappy in partnerships. Such practices are unlikely to wither away as a pattern of provision. Any comprehensive development of primary care must take their needs into account...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND. There is an {{assumption}} {{that men and women}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> adopt different practice styles in the management of gynaecological disorders. However, there is little evidence to support this view. AIM. A study was undertaken to compare the practice styles of men and women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in the management of menorrhagia. METHOD. The study took place in 73 general practices in the Oxford Regional Health Authority area. A total of 348 patients who consulted 74 men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and 43 women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> with a complaint of menorrhagia were recruited into the study and completed postal questionnaires nine and 18 months after entry into the study. Main outcome measures were men and women general practitioners' awareness of patients' treatment preferences, treatment received by patients, patients' involvement in treatment decisions and patients' satisfaction with treatment received. RESULTS. There were no statistically significant differences in treatment received by patients of men and women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners.</b> Fewer patients consulting women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were referred to a gynaecologist compared with patients consulting men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (56 % versus 64 %) and fewer underwent surgery (39 % versus 47 %). More patients consulting women <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> reported participation in treatment decisions (63 % versus 53 %) but more patients consulting men <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were satisfied with the care they received (66 % versus 55 %).

5|$|As more {{information}} about 's notoriety among neighbors surfaced, focus of investigation shifted towards {{the circumstances under which}} he gained and retained gun license and firearms. In order to be granted a gun license in the Czech Republic, a person must pass a qualification exam, receive a health clearance by a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner,</b> who may require a further examination by a specialist, such as a psychological or psychiatric evaluation, and must pass a background check. According to Section 23 of the Czech Firearms Act, an applicant may not be granted a license if he has committed more than one misdemeanor against public order in the previous three years. Similarly, the law further makes gun license unaccessible to people with mental illnesses. The license must be renewed every five years (every ten years for licenses issued after 1 July 2014).

40|$|Aim: To examine Australian private {{practice}} dietitians' relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and practice nurses {{as a factor}} that influences dietetic referrals. Methods: Semistructured telephone interviews and an online survey were conducted with Australian {{private practice}} dietitians (n = 52 and n = 90, respectively) between April and May 2008. Semistructured questionnaires were conducted with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (n = 11) and practice nurses (n = 12) from the 'GP Access' Division of General Practice between March and July 2007. Results: General practitioners' relationships with dietitians {{were believed to be}} the primary influencing factor on referral, provided by 81 % of survey dietitians and 25 % of interview dietitians. The most common means of initially forming relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> were face-to-face introduction (48 %) and introductory letters (37 %). Patient feedback via letter, fax or email was the most popular method of maintaining relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> (77 %). Meeting with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in person was believed to be the most effective activity in building relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and increasing referral rates (42 %). Referral was made easier for <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> by providing paper (37 %) or electronic (19 %) referral forms and contact details (19 %). The majority of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and dietitians believed that the 'Allied Health Services Under Medicare' made it easier to refer to a dietitian. Conclusions: Dietetic referrals can be encouraged through good relationships between <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> practice nurses and dietitians. Private practice dietitians would benefit from cultivating relationships with <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and practice nurses through personal contact and providing good patient feedback.

AIM: A study was undertaken comparing the attitudes to depression between <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and psychiatrists. METHOD: A sample of 74 <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> and 65 psychiatrists in Wales was surveyed by postal questionnaire. Attitudes were assessed by the depression attitude questionnaire and patient management was assessed by a questionnaire on prescribing practice.

Her sister, Nicola, is seven years older, and brother, David, is six years older. She learned to play classical piano from age six, {{following in the footsteps}} of Christopher and David, but realised she wanted to be a singer at about 12 when she appeared in an Armadale Primary School production of Andrew Lloyd Webber's musical Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. Bored with practice, she gave up playing piano at that time. Hoping for more freedom, she urged her parents to send her to Geelong Grammar School, an independent boarding school attended by her siblings. At Geelong she took up the piano again, this time playing jazz including performing with her brother David's group on weekends. She was introverted and found that piano practice helped her cope with living at boarding school.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a <b>general</b> <b>practitioner</b> serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow.

40|$|Objectives To {{explore how}} <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> operate the {{sickness}} certification system, {{their views on}} the system, and suggestions for change. Design Qualitative focus group study consisting of 11 focus groups with 67 participants. Setting <b>General</b> <b>practitioners</b> in practices in Glasgow, Tayside, and Highland regions, Scotland. Sample Purposive sample of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> with further theoretical sampling of key informant <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> to examine emerging themes. Results <b>General</b> <b>practitioners</b> believed that the sickness certification system failed to address complex, chronic, or doubtful cases. They seemed to develop various operational strategies for its implementation. There appeared to be important deliberate misuse of the system by <b>general</b> <b>practitioners,</b> possibly related to conflicts about roles and incongruities in the system. The doctor-patient relationship was perceived to conflict with the current role of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> in sickness certification. When making decisions about certification, the <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> considered a wide variety of factors. They experienced contradictory demands from other system stakeholders and felt blamed for failing to make impossible reconciliations. They clearly identified the difficulties of operating the system when there was no continuity of patient care. Many wished either to relinquish their gatekeeper role or to continue only with major changes. Conclusions Policy makers need to recognise and accommodate the range and complexity of factors that influence the behaviour of <b>general</b> <b>practitioners</b> operating as gatekeepers to the sickness certification system, before making changes.
