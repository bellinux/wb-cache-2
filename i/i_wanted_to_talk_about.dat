I got to choose the music, but this time around it was, like, I'd sit down and think: 'What {{happened}} to me yesterday? What happened to me today?' and just write. It was very therapeutic, in a way. And easy – I was shocked at {{how easy it was}} to be honest about yourself and things that affect you. It is a dance record, but I wanted it to be serious. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> serious things, but do it in a not-so-serious way, with music that makes you want to get up and dance.|$|E
500|$|People assume things, {{because as}} I said, I pull from my {{personal}} experiences {{to make my}} music... I never experienced [...] firsthand, but it's something <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> ... and it's something {{that has happened to}} me in the past... As I said, I have a few deep, dark ones that I've kept stowed away in a closet for a minute... That's why I take this time to speak to you guys and let you know really what it is... I will tell you that I loved [...] a lot and she obviously loved me; it just didn't work out. But cheating is not what caused the relationship to collide and crash. That ain't what broke it up.|$|E
500|$|The idea of {{parallel}} lives has been explored before in {{films such as}} Run Lola Run (1998) and Sliding Doors (1998) which influenced Van Dormael's writing. Unlike any of those, Mr. Nobody has philosophical underpinning inspired by scientific tomes on chaos theory and the butterfly effect, pigeon superstition, and the space-time continuum. Van Dormael stated, [...] "My starting point was a 12-minute short I made in 1982 called È pericoloso sporgersi. A kid runs behind a train with two possible choices: to go with his mother or with his father. From there we follow two possible futures. I started one version {{based on the fact}} that a woman jumps or doesn't jump on a train. Then Sliding Doors by Peter Howitt came out, followed by Run Lola Run by Tom Tykwer. I had to find something else. And that's when I realised that the story I was trying to tell was not binary, that I was above all interested by the multiplicity and complexity of choices. With this screenplay I wanted to make the viewer feel the abyss that is the infinity of possibilities. Beyond this, I wanted to find a different way of telling a story. I wanted the gaze of the child on his future to meet the gaze of the old man he has become on his past. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> complexity through cinema, which is a simplifying medium. While reality around us is more and more complex, the information is more and more succinct, political speeches are more and more simplistic. What interests me is complexity. Not the simple answers, which are reassuring but bound to be false." ...|$|E

2500|$|During an {{interview}} in Cliché Magazine (June/July 2010), Hilton said that he only started blogging as a hobby. [...] "What set my site apart is that prior to PerezHilton.com, most blogs were mainly online journals and diaries, but that never interested me. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> celebrities because they're far more entertaining." [...] On March 11, 2005, within {{the first six months}} of Hilton's blogging career, PageSixSixSix.com was named [...] "Hollywood's Most-Hated Website" [...] by The Insider, catalyzing an initial surge in its popularity which temporarily crippled its server. Hilton claimed that on July 30, 2007, a seemingly [...] "ordinary day", Perezhilton.com had over 8.82 million page views in a 24-hour period. Other sources dispute the reliability of Hilton's traffic claims.|$|E
2500|$|In fall 2000, Norwood {{finally began}} conceiving ideas {{for a third}} studio album with the Atlantic label. While Rodney Jerkins, the main {{producer}} of her previous album, and his Darkchild crew, including Fred Jerkins III and LaShawn Daniels, {{had been working on}} several new songs for the singer's upcoming project in hopes of recreating the winning chemistry of Never Say Never, [...] Norwood {{wanted to make sure that}} she was gaining more creative control over the project and thus, arranged meetings with all her writers and musicians to discuss the lyricals topics and sounds she wanted for the album. [...] "I was involved from A-Z," [...] she said. [...] "Every song on the album was inspired by my life [...] <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> how I feel on so many levels. I wanted to be in touch with all of my emotions and share them. I've taken three years off for myself and got a chance to find things I like to do, things I don't like and things I want to change about myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|From the Inside Out {{combines}} the genres of pop, rock, hip hop, soul and R. Lead single [...] "Unbroken" [...] {{has been described}} as a [...] "chest-beating and uplifting" [...] single, while the second single, [...] "Choose You" [...] has been appreciated for its [...] "soaring pop and grand stomp". According to Cameron Adams from The Daily Telegraph, [...] "Inside Out" [...] "borrows Usher's electro thunderclaps and robo-R". [...] "All I Need" [...] makes use of Auto-Tune and has been compared to will.i.am. According to Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald, [...] "Homesick" [...] is [...] "lush, pure pop" [...] and [...] "One Thing" [...] is influenced by R and hip hop. [...] "The One", featuring Pixie Lott, has been called [...] "a dramatic ballad", and [...] "Love Graffiti" [...] has been compared to The Beatles. Most of the songs' lyrics explore the theme of love. Walker stated, [...] "I wanted to make an album of songs, with real lyrics about how we all feel sometimes. There's a lot of manufactured songs with nasty lyrics, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> real love, real situations that people could really connect to." [...] He named [...] "Love Graffiti" [...] as his favourite track for that reason, valuing the positive way it portrays love.|$|E

2500|$|American R singer-songwriter Ne-Yo {{was also}} {{involved}} in the album and wrote three songs which were produced by StarGate. When describing the process of working with him, Rowland said, [...] "Ne-Yo asked me what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about,</b> and I replied 'I'm in a different space. Change is very comfortable for me, and I'm happy where I am'." [...] The first of these records, [...] "Shake Them Haters Off", was originally {{intended to be a}} single in the US. It is an [...] "up-tempo" [...] and fun record with lyrics such as [...] "Its like a job I that I never get a break from/because haters never take a vacation." [...] Another collaboration titled [...] "Grown Ass Woman" [...] (later changed to [...] "Grown Woman") was described by Rowland as her favorite song on the album. Ne-Yo conceptualized the song in a three-minute conversation with Rowland, where she told him she wanted a record where she could claim [...] "I'm grown!". According to Janine Simon from Honey Mag, on [...] "Grown [...] Woman" [...] Rowland digs [...] "through old pictures from the Destiny's Child days reflecting on how far she has come yet how 'Grown and silly' she still is." [...] It would later be released as one of the album's two US lead singles. The pair collaborated on a third song, [...] "Heaven and Earth", described by Simon as a ballad using imagery to demonstrate a [...] "sonic portrait, painted with flecks of sentiment; a picture of what the singer believes is what 'we deserve as a people'." [...] According to Rowland, one of these three records was also recorded as a duet featuring Ne-Yo's vocals. None of these songs made the album apart from [...] "Heaven and Earth", which features as song number eleven on the deluxe edition.|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "Iron Man" [...] was {{originally}} entitled [...] "Iron Bloke"; upon hearing the main guitar riff {{for the first}} time, Osbourne remarked that it sounded [...] "like a big iron bloke walking around". The title was later changed to [...] "Iron Man" [...] as bassist and lyricist Geezer Butler composed the lyrics. [...] The riff to [...] "Iron Man" [...] is iconic among heavy metal guitarists, with Osbourne declaring in his memoir that [...] "...Tony Iommi {{turned out to be}} one of the greatest heavy rock riff-makers of all time. Whenever we went into the studio we'd challenge him to beat his last riff and he'd come up with something like 'Iron Man' and blow everyone away." [...] Butler wrote the lyrics as the story of a man who time travels into the future and sees the apocalypse. In the process of returning to the present, he is turned into steel by a magnetic field. He is rendered mute, unable verbally to warn people of his time of the impending destruction. His attempts to communicate are ignored and mocked. This causes Iron Man to become angry and have his revenge on mankind, causing the destruction seen in his vision. [...] "Electric Funeral" [...] also contains apocalyptic imagery dealing with nuclear warfare. In The Last Supper concert film, Iommi remembers that at the time with most bands [...] "it was all the 'flowers in your hair' and we wanted to sing and play about the other side of life." [...] In the 1992 documentary Don't Blame Me Osbourne concurs: [...] "It was me and five kids living in a two bedroom house. My father worked nights, my mother worked days, we had no money, we never had a car, we very rarely went on holiday... And suddenly, you know, we hear about 'If you're going to San Francisco be sure to wear a flower in your hair'. And we're thinking, (contemptuously) 'What the fuck is San Francisco? Where is this? What's all this flower shit? I've got no shoes on my feet. [...] "You could just see that a lot of things were going wrong in the world," [...] Butler recalled to Classic Albums in 2010, [...] "and no one was saying anything about it. Bob Dylan had long since faded from the present memory and there was nobody talkin' about the things that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> political stuff so that's what inspired me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I've been {{thinking}} all summer, Mrs. Maturin. There {{was so much}} <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> with you, but I {{wanted to be sure}} of myself first.

6000|$|... "Oh yes," [...] she replied, {{and then}} she began {{to speak of the}} {{pleasant}} days she had spent in that village. As she talked I endeavored to discover from her words who she was and what was her position. I did not care to discuss Walford. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> the Holly Sprig Inn, but I could not devise a courteous question which would serve my purpose.|$|E
60|$|But somebody's always {{taking the}} joy out of life. I {{ought to have}} remembered that the most {{metropolitan}} thing in the metropolis is a rustic who's putting in a week there. We weren't thinking on the same plane, Charlie and me. The way I had been feeling all day, what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> was last season's crops. The subject he fancied was this season's chorus-girls. Our souls didn't touch by {{a mile and a}} half.|$|E
60|$|AFTER breakfast <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> {{the dead}} man and guess out how he come to be killed, but Jim didn't want to. He said it would fetch bad luck; and besides, he said, he might come and ha'nt us; he said a man that warn't buried {{was more likely to}} go a-ha'nting around than one that was planted and comfortable. That sounded pretty reasonable, so I didn't say no more; but I couldn't keep from {{studying}} over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man, and what they done it for.|$|E

60|$|MRS GEORGE [coming to {{the hearth}} and {{addressing}} Reginald] Mr Bridgenorth: will you oblige me by leaving {{me with this}} young man. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him like a mother, on YOUR business.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{doubt if}} I did help much, {{but after the}} horse knocked me down I went to the {{homestead}} and Jardine was kind. Now <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him; he's a good rancher." ...|$|R
60|$|My {{views on}} this subject are, I know, heretical. I cannot get it into my unpatriotic head that size {{is the only thing}} worth {{worrying}} about. In England, when I venture to express my out-of-date opinions, I am called a Little Englander. It fretted me at first; I was becoming a mere shadow. But by now I have got used to it. It would be the same, I feel, wherever I went. In New York I should be a Little American; in Constantinople a Little Turk. But <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> Holland. A holiday in Holland serves as a corrective to exaggerated Imperialistic notions.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, it's {{all gone}} bloo-ey. I'll {{tell you about}} that in a minute. Coming back to this man in England, if you're in any doubt about it...

But that's not what <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about.</b> I was saying one doesn't always know one's own mind at first, and if this fellow really is a good fellow... and Fillmore tells me he's got {{all the money in the}} world..." ...|$|E
60|$|Fancy your {{imagining that}} you had come into my life in order to darken it. Why, you ARE my life. If you went out of it, what would be left? You talk about my {{happiness}} before I met you--but oh, how empty it all was! I read, and played, and sang as you say, but what a void there was! I did it to please mother, but there really seemed no very clear reason why I should continue to do it. Then you came, and everything was changed. I read because you are fond of reading and because <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> books with you. I played because you are fond of music. I sang {{in the hope that}} it might please you. Whatever I did, you were always in my mind. I tried and tried to become a better and nobler woman, because I wanted to be worthy of the love you bore me. I have changed, and developed, and improved more {{in the last three months}} than in all my life before. And then you come and tell me that you have darkened my life. You know better now. My life has become full and rich, for Love fills my life. It is the keynote of my nature, the foundation, the motive power. It inspires me to make the most of any gift or talent that I have. How could I tell you all this if I did not know that your own feeling was as deep. I could not have given the one, great, and only love of my life in exchange for a half-hearted affection from you. But you will never again make the mistake of supposing that any material consideration can affect our love.|$|E
