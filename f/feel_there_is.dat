They have also expressed an openness to evolutionary theory in biology, except where they perceive {{that it is in}} conflict with the Torah's account of creation.|$|E
25|$|While green {{has emerged}} as the color of Taiwan {{independence}} and can be seen ubiquitously in pro-independence rallies, at the moment, no one flag has achieved consensus among the various groups. Unlike other political movements, those in Taiwan do not <b>feel</b> <b>there</b> <b>is</b> a historical or local flag suitable for use as a symbol. The flag of the short-lived Republic of Formosa is considered to be unsuitable by some, since that republic was declared by Chinese loyalists and designed as a tributary state in a failed attempt to avert Japanese colonization in 1895. The present national flag, the flag of the Republic of China, is seen by others as a symbol of Chinese nationalism.|$|E

Elspeth and Matthew later deduce that tortuous experiments on their kind are occurring, and they resolve to escape.
