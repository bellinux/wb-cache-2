5|$|The {{innermost}} cortical layer, the zona reticularis, lies directly {{adjacent to}} the medulla. It produces androgens, mainly <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the precursor to testosterone) in humans. Its small cells form irregular cords and clusters, separated by capillaries and connective tissue. The cells contain relatively small quantities of cytoplasm and lipid droplets, and sometimes display brown lipofuscin pigment.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal activity, such as {{occurs during}} menstrual cycles and puberty, may {{contribute}} to the formation of acne. During puberty, an increase in sex hormones called androgens causes the skin follicle glands to grow larger and make more oily sebum. Several hormones have been linked to acne, including the androgens testosterone, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), and <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA); high levels of growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) have also been associated with worsened acne. Both androgens and IGF-1 seem to be essential for acne to occur, as acne does not develop in individuals with complete androgen insensitivity syndrome (CAIS) or Laron syndrome (insensitivity to GH, resulting in very low IGF-1 levels).|$|E
25|$|Blood {{levels of}} <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> increase, {{and levels of}} <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate {{decrease}} in response to critical illness.|$|E
25|$|Adrenal androgens are steroids {{produced}} by the zona reticulosa of the adrenal cortex in both sexes. The major adrenal androgens are <b>dehydroepiandrosterone,</b> androstenedione (which are precursors of testosterone), and <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate which is present in large amounts in the blood. Adrenal androgens contribute to the androgenic events of early puberty in girls.|$|E
25|$|The main {{subset of}} androgens, known as adrenal androgens, is {{composed}} of 19-carbon steroids synthesized in the zona reticularis, the innermost layer of the adrenal cortex. Adrenal androgens function as weak steroids (though some are precursors), and the subset includes <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate (DHEA-S), androstenedione (A4), and androstenediol (A5).|$|E
25|$|The inner most {{cortical}} layer, the zona reticularis produces androgens, mainly <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), DHEA sulfate (DHEA-S), and androstenedione (the {{precursor to}} testosterone) in humans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA) is a {{steroid hormone}} {{produced}} in the adrenal cortex from cholesterol. It is the primary precursor of natural estrogens. DHEA is also called dehydroisoandrosterone or dehydroandrosterone.|$|E
25|$|Other {{endogenous}} estrogens, the biosyntheses {{of which}} do not involve aromatase, include 27-hydroxycholesterol, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), 7-oxo-DHEA, 7α-hydroxy-DHEA, 16α-hydroxy-DHEA, 7β-hydroxyepiandrosterone, androstenedione (A4), androstenediol (A5), 3α-androstanediol, and 3β-androstanediol, and may have important endogenous functions as estrogens. Some estrogen metabolites, such as the catechol estrogens 2-hydroxyestradiol, 2-hydroxyestrone, 4-hydroxyestradiol, and 4-hydroxyestrone, as well as 16α-hydroxyestrone, are also estrogens {{with varying degrees of}} activity.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to the sudden fall in estradiol during menopause, the levels of total and free testosterone, as well as <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate (DHEAS) and androstenedione appear to decline more or less steadily with age. An effect of natural menopause on circulating androgen levels has not been observed. Thus specific tissue effects of natural menopause cannot be attributed to loss of androgenic hormone production.|$|E
25|$|Use {{of blood}} test panels may help in diagnosis. The OVA1 panel {{includes}} CA-125, beta-2 microglobulin, transferrin, apolipoprotein A1, and transthyretin. OVA1 above 5.0 in premenopausal people and 4.4 in postmenopausal people indicates {{a high risk}} for cancer. A different set of laboratory tests is used for detecting sex cord-stromal tumors. High levels of testosterone or <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate, combined with other symptoms {{and high levels of}} inhibin A and inhibin B can be indicative of an SCST of any type.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), {{also known}} as androstenolone, is an {{endogenous}} steroid hormone. It {{is one of the}} most abundant circulating steroids in humans, in whom it is produced in the adrenal glands, the gonads, and the brain, where it functions as a metabolic intermediate in the biosynthesis of the androgen and estrogen sex steroids. However, DHEA also has a variety of potential biological effects in its own right, binding to an array of nuclear and cell surface receptors, and acting as a neurosteroid and neurotrophin.|$|E
25|$|Another basic {{drive is}} the sexual drive which like food motivates us {{because it is}} {{essential}} to our survival. The desire for sex is wired deep into the brain of all human beings as glands secrete hormones that travel through the blood to the brain and stimulates the onset of sexual desire. The hormone involved in the initial onset of sexual desire is called <b>Dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA). The hormonal basis of both men and women's sex drives is testosterone. Men naturally have more testosterone than women do and so are more likely than woman to think about sex.|$|E
25|$|Hormonal {{therapy for}} {{prostate}} cancer targets the pathways the body uses to produce DHT. A feedback loop involving the testicles, the hypothalamus, and the pituitary, adrenal, and prostate glands controls the blood levels of DHT. First, low blood levels of DHT stimulate the hypothalamus to produce gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). GnRH then stimulates the pituitary gland to produce luteinizing hormone (LH), and LH stimulates the testicles to produce testosterone. Finally, testosterone from the testicles and <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> from the adrenal glands stimulate the prostate to produce more DHT. Hormonal therapy can decrease levels of DHT by interrupting this pathway at any point.|$|E
25|$|Serum (blood) {{levels of}} androgens (hormones {{associated}} with male development), including androstenedione and testosterone may be elevated. <b>Dehydroepiandrosterone</b> sulfate levels above 700–800µg/dL are highly suggestive of adrenal dysfunction because DHEA-S is made exclusively by the adrenal glands. The free testosterone level {{is thought to}} be the best measure, with ~60% of PCOS patients demonstrating supranormal levels. The Free androgen index (FAI) of the ratio of testosterone to sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG) is high and is meant to be a predictor of free testosterone, but is a poor parameter for this and is no better than testosterone alone as a marker for PCOS, possibly because FAI is correlated with the degree of obesity.|$|E
25|$|The {{prostate}} {{is a part}} of {{the male}} reproductive system that helps make and store seminal fluid. In adult men, a typical prostate is about 3 centimeters long and weighs about 20 grams. It is located in the pelvis, under the urinary bladder and in front of the rectum. The prostate surrounds part of the urethra, the tube that carries urine from the bladder during urination and semen during ejaculation. Because of its location, prostate diseases often affect urination, ejaculation, and rarely defecation. The prostate contains many small glands which make about 20% of the fluid constituting semen. In prostate cancer, the cells of these prostate glands mutate into cancer cells. The prostate glands require male hormones, known as androgens, to work properly. Androgens include testosterone, which is made in the testes; <b>dehydroepiandrosterone,</b> made in the adrenal glands; and dihydrotestosterone, which is converted from testosterone within the prostate itself. Androgens are also responsible for secondary sex characteristics such as facial hair and increased muscle mass.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA) is {{the most}} {{abundant}} circulating androgen hormone and can be rapidly metabolized within target tissues into potent androgens and estrogens. Gonadal steroids generally regulate aggression during the breeding season, but non-gonadal steroids may regulate aggression during the non-breeding season. Castration of various species in the non-breeding season {{has no effect on}} territorial aggression. In several avian studies, circulating DHEA {{has been found to be}} elevated in birds during the non-breeding season. These data support the idea that non-breeding birds combine adrenal and/or gonadal DHEA synthesis with neural DHEA metabolism to maintain territorial behavior when gonadal testosterone secretion is low. Similar results have been found in studies involving different strains of rats, mice, and hamsters. DHEA levels also have been studied in humans and may play a role in human aggression. Circulating DHEAS (its sulfated ester) levels rise during adrenarche (~7 years of age) while plasma testosterone levels are relatively low. This implies that aggression in pre-pubertal children with aggressive conduct disorder might be correlated with plasma DHEAS rather than plasma testosterone, suggesting an important link between DHEAS and human aggressive behavior.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone enanthate, and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E
25|$|Although {{progesterone}} {{does not}} bind {{directly to the}} AR, it is a precursor and intermediate in the biosynthesis of androgens from cholesterol. For this reason, {{there has been some}} speculation that exogenous progesterone could be transformed into androgens by certain tissues that express the requisite enzymes. Progesterone is converted by 17α-hydroxylase into 17α-hydroxyprogesterone, 17α-hydroxyprogesterone is converted by 17,20-lyase into androstenedione, and androstenedione is converted by 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases into testosterone. CYP17A1, the cytochrome P450 gene that encodes 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase, is expressed mainly in the gonads (ovaries and testes) and the adrenal glands. Despite the reasoning that progesterone could be converted into androgens however, clinical studies in which women were treated with 100 to 300mg/day OMP have found no or only a small increase in levels of 17α-hydroxyprogesterone and no change in androgen levels, including those of <b>dehydroepiandrosterone,</b> androstenedione, and testosterone. In these studies, levels of estradiol and cortisol, which progesterone is also a precursor of, did not change either, although levels of 11-deoxycorticosterone did increase significantly. In accordance with the lack of changes in androgen levels, progesterone, unlike various progestins, has not been associated with androgenic effects in clinical studies, including changes in the blood lipid profile or sex hormone-binding globulin levels, acne, skin oiliness, hirsutism, or voice deepening, or induction of teratogenicity (i.e., virilization of female fetuses).|$|E

2500|$|Bioidentical hormone {{replacement}} therapy (BHRT), also known as bioidentical hormone therapy or natural hormone therapy, is a term referring {{to the use of}} hormones that are identical on a molecular level with endogenous hormones in {{hormone replacement}} therapy. It may also be combined with blood and saliva testing of hormone levels, and the use of pharmacy compounding to obtain hormones in an effort to reach a targeted level of hormones in the body. A number of claims by some proponents of bioidentical {{hormone replacement therapy}} have not been definitively established through [...] scientific testing. [...] Specific hormones used in BHRT include estrone, estradiol, progesterone (which are available both in FDA-approved manufactured products and as pharmacy-compounded products), testosterone, <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (both testosterone and <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> have some stringent limits placed on their availability and approval in Canada and the United States), and estriol (which is available in Europe but is not approved in Canada and the United States).|$|E
2500|$|Typically, {{compounded}} preparations of bioidentical hormones include estriol, estrone, estradiol, testosterone, progesterone {{and sometimes}} <b>dehydroepiandrosterone</b> (DHEA), either individually {{or in some}} combination.

2500|$|Cortisol is {{produced}} {{in the human body}} by the adrenal gland in the zona fasciculata, the second of three layers comprising the adrenal cortex. The cortex forms the outer [...] "bark" [...] of each adrenal gland, situated atop the kidneys. The release of cortisol is controlled by the hypothalamus, a part of the brain. [...] The secretion of corticotropin-releasing hormone by the hypothalamus triggers cells in the neighboring anterior pituitary to secrete another hormone, the adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), into the vascular system, through which blood carries it to the adrenal cortex. ACTH stimulates the synthesis of cortisol, glucocorticoids, mineralocorticoids, and <b>dehydroepiandrosterone.</b>|$|E
