5|$|According to {{the authors}} of the 2011 genetic study, the close {{relation}} between the King Island and mainland emus indicates that the former population was <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> latter relatively recently, due to sea level changes in the Bass Strait, as opposed to a founding emu lineage that diverged from the mainland emu far earlier and had subsequently gone extinct on the mainland. Models of sea level change indicate that Tasmania, including King Island, was <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Australian mainland around 14,000 years ago. Up to several thousand years later King Island was then separated from Tasmania. This scenario would suggest that a population ancestral to both the King Island and Tasmanian emu was initially <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mainland taxon, after which the King Island and Tasmanian populations were separated. This in turn indicates that the likewise extinct Tasmanian emu is probably as closely related to the mainland emu as is the King Island emu, with both the King Island and Tasmanian emu being more closely related to each other. Fossil emu taxa show an average size between that of the King Island emu and mainland emu. Hence, mainland emus can be regarded as a large or gigantic form.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to compare 9 isolates of B. japonicum on formation of root nodule, wich inoculated to the soybean (Glycine max (L.) Merril) under agroforestry system. This research was conducted under agrorestry system which is soybean planted under of teak that stands on the age + 2 years and + 10 m in height at Landungsari Village of Dau Subdistrict of Malang Regency and at Biotechnology Laboratory of Muhammadiyah University of Malang. This research was done starting from April 13 th, 2008 to August 2008. This research used simple Group Random Design (RAK), along with 10 level treatments which was repeated three times. These treatments include: I 0 (without isolate), I 1 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak 1), I 2 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak 2), I 3 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak 3), I 4 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak 4), I 5 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak 5), I 6 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak 6), I 7 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of Citrus sp.), I 8 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of Morinda citrifolia L.), and I 9 (<b>Isolate</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of Paraserianthes falcataria). Data analysis used homogenous analysis (F-test) along with obvious level of 5 %, followed by BNJ-test along with obvious level of 5 %, if the treatments have obvious influence. The research showed that treatment using isolate B. japponicum has insignificant influence toward growth and yield of the soybean, unless yields for dry weight of the capsules, dry weight of the seed, dry weight of the stem, and dry weight of the roots. <b>Isolate</b> B. japponicum <b>from</b> <b>the</b> group of teak showed more effective improvement in nodule forming under agroforestry system than other isolate.

40|$|A {{panel of}} five serovar-specific {{monoclonal}} antibodies which distinguish the five known avian serovars of Chlamydia psittaci {{was used to}} serotype 45 European avian Chlamydia psittaci isolates. Chlamydial antigen was grown in Buffalo green monkey (BGM) cells or in embryonated chicken eggs and was then inoculated into BGM cells. Serotyping was performed in an indirect immunofluorescence test. The 45 European isolates included 22 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> order Psittaciformes, 9 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> order Columbiformes, 6 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> order Galliformes, 5 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> order Passeriformes, and 3 <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> order Anseriformes. All of these were successfully serotyped. No additional serovars were found. One <b>isolate</b> <b>from</b> a duck and two <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> psittacine birds gave positive immunofluorescences with two monoclonal antibodies considered to be specific for two different serovars. These three isolates were cloned by an agar overlay method. Serotyping of the clones demonstrated that the duck and one psittacine bird each were infected with two different serovars. After cloning, one <b>isolate</b> <b>from</b> a psittacine bird reacted only with serovar A. From these results {{it was concluded that}} this serotyping system allows the classification of all isolates tested so far. The results show that similar serovars are prevalent in avian species in Europe and the United States. The results also indicate that birds from a certain order are more susceptible to a distinct serovar. The use of a panel of serovar-specific monoclonal antibodies in the immunofluorescence test provides a reliable method for serotyping avian isolates. Monoclona...|$|R
5|$|Several parasites {{have been}} <b>isolated</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hartebeest. These parasites {{regularly}} alternate between hartebeest and gazelles or wildebeest.

40|$|AbstractAntibiotic-resistant {{bacteria}} {{have emerged}} {{due to the}} selective pressure of antimicrobial use in humans and animals.

We studied the antibiotic resistance patterns among 493 Escherichia col/isolates from different aquatic environmental sources collected from October 2008 to May 2009 in Leon, Nicaragua. High levels of antibiotic resistance were found in E. coli isolates in hospital sewage water and in eight of 87 well-water samples. Among <b>the</b> resistant <b>isolates</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> hospital sewage, ampicillin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, nalidixic acid, trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole was the most common multi-resistance profile.
