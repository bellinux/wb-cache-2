40|$|<b>Illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> is {{a serious}} problem in many {{countries}} because of its tremendous adverse social, economic and political impacts. <b>Illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> is international in nature. A drug illicitly produced in one country often ends up in another country, changing hands many times in different countries. This international nature of <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> warrants effective and concerted international action to fight it. Since the harms of drug abuse and the problems of <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> {{came to the attention of}} the international community in the early part of this century, efforts have been exerted to establish and improve an international legal framework to provide principles and guidelines for effective national and international action in the control of drugs and the fight against <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic.</b> Several multilateral <b>drug</b> treaties have been concluded to that end. Since these treaties are not self-executing, they must be fully implemented by national Governments to produce the desired effects. This study examines Australia's implementation of the multilateral drug treaties to which it is a Party. The focus will be placed on three aspects, which are: extradition of <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> related offenders; mutual legal assistance in the fight against the traffic; and other forms of international cooperation. Current trends in worldwide <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic</b> having impacts on Australia are also briefly discussed to indicate directions for Australia's future action in the fight against <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> <b>traffic...</b>|$|R

Chapter one introduces the global drug problem, the policy options available to deal with it, and the regulation of this problem by a system established by international law. Chapter two places the international drug control system in historical context. Chapter three examines the crimes and penalties that the drug conventions require Parties to create in their national law. Chapter four examines the provisions in the drug conventions that deal with jurisdiction over drug offences, extradition of drug offenders, and miscellaneous procedural provisions. Chapter five investigates the international regulation of enforcement in the sense of actual policing, prosecution and punishment of drug offenders. Chapter six examines the alternative methods of control of <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> related activities provided for under international law, such as treatment and rehabilitation. Chapter seven examines the supervisory organs of the international drug control system, the supervision of the system and its execution and enforcement. Chapter eight attempts a general comment upon the nature of the system and its aim of suppressing <b>illicit</b> <b>drug</b> use. While the major concern of this study is an examination of the technical rules of international law designed to suppress <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs,</b> it is also concerned with the policy of prohibition that underpins these rules, because of the interrelationship between this policy and the shape of the international legal provisions designed to implement it...|$|R
