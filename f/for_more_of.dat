5|$|During Last's tenure, Brasenose had a {{very high}} number of undergraduates: a peak of 104 in 1949, second in the University. Results, however, were poor: two firsts in 1950, placing the college 18th. It was only near the end that things picked up, perhaps a result of Last's stern manner; there were 13 firsts in 1955. However, until 1970, they {{remained}} poor, with only a small increase on the pre-War years. Brasenose sat twenty-first in the Norrington Table in 1968, twenty-sixth in 1975, and twenty-seventh in 1980. It was into this that Hart made his reforms, to bring students closer to the governing body and make them responsible <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> their own care– cleaning and washing, for example. By 2001, Brasenose had climbed the tables once again, coming in third place in the Norrington Table with 30 firsts.|$|E
5|$|The diet of the Arctic tern varies {{depending}} on location and time, but is usually carnivorous. In most cases, it eats small fish or marine crustaceans. Fish species comprise {{the most important part}} of the diet, and account <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the biomass consumed than any other food. Prey species are immature (1–2-year old) shoaling species such as herring, cod, sandlances, and capelin. Among the marine crustaceans eaten are amphipods, crabs and krill. Sometimes, these birds also eat molluscs, marine worms, or berries, and on their northern breeding grounds, insects.|$|E
5|$|The {{prognosis}} {{is good for}} stable lesions (stageI and II) in juveniles with open growth plates; treated conservatively—typically without surgery—50% of cases will heal. Recovery in juveniles {{can be attributed to}} the bone's ability to repair damaged or dead bone tissue and cartilage in a process called bone remodeling. Open growth plates are characterized by increased numbers of undifferentiated chondrocytes (stem cells) which are precursors to both bone and cartilaginous tissue. As a result, open growth plates allow <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the stem cells necessary for repair in the affected joint. Unstable, large, full-thickness lesions (stageIII and IV) or lesions of any stage found in the skeletally mature are more likely to fail non-operative treatment. These lesions offer a worse prognosis and surgery is required in most cases.|$|E

5|$|The next day, England resumed hoping <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> what {{happened}} on the opening day. The ground was again full, with even more people squashed in than the previous day. The sun was obscured by heavy cloud cover, further hindering the visibility of a ground without a sightscreen. The two English batsmen were initially tentative and played and missed frequently, and only two singles were scored in the first 15 minutes of play. The England team frequently looked towards the sky; as they needed to win the match and were in a good position, they hoped that time would not be lost to rain. Bradman set a deep-set defensive field as he sought to have Lindwall and Johnston contain the batsmen before the third new ball became available. In all, England scored only five runs in the first half-hour, as the two batsmen sought to survive and be set when the new ball was taken and the Australian attack advantaged. During this time the main threat to the batsmen was Lindwall, who bowled a spell at high pace and unsettled Edrich, who sparred at a number of balls. As soon as it was possible, Bradman took the new ball, and Bedser endeavoured to keep his wicket intact to shield Denis Compton and the other middle-order batsmen from having to come in against a swinging ball. During this period Bedser did not attempt to exploit his strong physique to hit the ball hard. Continuing the defensive strategy of seeing off the new ball, {{it was not until the}} 48th minute of play that Edrich reached his 50 in 193 minutes, although he did miss several attempted cut shots that went past the outside edge. However, the hosts had seen off the new ball without losing a wicket. Bedser then glanced a ball for four; England scored only 22 runs in the first hour.|$|E

25|$|In August 1871, Ruskin {{purchased}} from W. J. Linton the then somewhat dilapidated Brantwood, {{on the shores}} of Coniston Water, in the English Lake District, paying £1500. It remains open to visitors today. It was Ruskin's main home from 1872 until his death. His estate provided a site <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his practical schemes and experiments: an ice house was built, the gardens were comprehensively rearranged, he oversaw the construction of a larger harbour (from where he rowed his boat, the Jumping Jenny), and altered the house (adding a dining room, turret to his bedroom to give a panoramic view of the lake, and later expanding further to accommodate his relatives). He built a reservoir, and redirected the waterfall down the hills, adding a slate seat that faced the tumbling stream rather than the lake, so that he could closely observe the fauna and flora of the hillside.|$|E

25|$|For {{about two}} hours the two sides faced {{each other across the}} {{clearing}} as Banks waited <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his troops to arrive and Taylor arranged his men. At that point, Taylor enjoyed a numerical advantage over Banks. At about 4:00 pm, the Confederates surged forward. On {{the east side of the}} road, Mouton was killed, while several of his regimental commanders were hit as well and the charge of his division was repulsed. However, west of the road, Walker's Texas division wrapped around the Union position, folding it in on itself. Ransom was wounded trying to rally his men and was carried from the field; hundreds of Union troops were captured and the rest retreated in a panic. As the first Union line collapsed, Cameron's division was arriving to form a second line but it too was pushed back by the charging Confederates, with Franklin wounded as well but remaining on the field in command. For several miles the Confederates pursued the retreating Union troops until they encountered a third line formed by Emory's division. The Confederates launched several charges on the Union line but were repulsed, while nightfall ended the battle.|$|E
25|$|The Tamamushi Shrine is {{a common}} example of {{painting}} that derived from Baekje and provides important evidence for the Korean peninsula's and the Chinese mainland's strong cultural transfer to the Japanese islands. The shrine is named for the many wings of the tamamushi beetle that once adorned it but have since deteriorated. The paintings that cover building and dais are of Jataka tales, bodhisattvas, the Four Heavenly Kings, and other buddhist iconography. The front panels of the building show the Four Guardian Kings clad in armor with long flowing scarves. On the side doors are bodhisattvas holding lotus blossoms and forming a mudra. On the back is represented a sacred landscape with heights topped with pagodas. The dais shows on its front relics, seated monks making offerings, and apsara. On the back is depicted Mount Sumeru. The right side shows {{a scene from the}} Nirvana Sutra, where the Buddha offers his life in return <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the sacred teachings, before being caught in his plummet by Indra. On the left panel of the dais is a scene from the Golden Light Sutra of a bodhisattva removing his upper garments before casting himself from a cliff to feed a hungry tigress and her cubs.|$|E

500|$|Kapoor's second Filmfare {{nomination}} {{that year}} came for Rajkumar Hirani's National Film Award-winning 3 Idiots, a film {{loosely based on}} the novel Five Point Someone by Chetan Bhagat. Co-starring alongside Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan and Sharman Joshi, Kapoor played Pia (a medical student and Khan's love interest). Several actresses were considered for the role, though Kapoor was eventually cast under the recommendation of Khan. The film received critical acclaim and emerged as the highest-grossing Bollywood film of all time up until then, grossing [...] in India. It also did well internationally, earning over , the second biggest Bollywood success ever in the overseas market. The Deccan Herald opined that Kapoor [...] "brings a dollop of sunshine and feminine grace to an otherwise masculine tale. She is so spunky and spontaneous you wish there was room <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> her." [...] 3 Idiots received several Best Movie recognitions at major Indian award functions, and Kapoor was awarded the IIFA Award for Best Actress, among others.|$|E
500|$|When Congress adjourned in late July, Stevens {{remained}} in Washington, {{too ill to}} return to Pennsylvania. [...] Stevens was in pain from his stomach ailments, from swollen feet, and from dropsy. By early August, {{he was unable to}} leave the house.

500|$|During the Prime Minister's Western swing, St. Laurent made formal speeches only {{in major}} cities. In {{contrast}} to Diefenbaker's whistle-stop train touring, with a hasty speech in each town {{as the train}} passed through, the Liberals allowed ample time for [...] "Uncle Louis" [...] {{to shake hands with}} voters, pat their children on the head, and kiss their babies. In British Columbia, St. Laurent took the position that there were hardly any national issues worth discussing—the Liberals had brought Canada prosperity and all that was needed <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> the same was to return the party to office. After touring Western Canada, St. Laurent spent the remainder of the second week of the campaign returning to, and in, Ottawa. The third week opened with a major speech in Quebec City, followed by intensive campaigning in Ontario. The fifth week was devoted to the Maritime provinces and Eastern Quebec. The sixth week opened with a major rally in Ottawa, before St. Laurent returned to the Maritimes and Quebec, and the final week was spent in Ontario before St. Laurent returned to his hometown of Quebec City for the election.|$|E
500|$|In July 1937, the Williams and McNeil {{families}} {{opened a}} boarding house on South Perry Street in downtown Montgomery. It {{was at this}} time that Williams decided to change his name informally from Hiram to Hank, a name he said was better suited to his desired career in country music. During the same year he participated in a talent show at the Empire Theater. He won the first prize of $15, singing his first original song [...] "WPA Blues". Williams wrote the lyrics and used the tune of Riley Puckett's [...] "Dissatisfied." [...] He never learned to read music and, {{for the rest of his}} career, based his compositions in storytelling. After school and on weekends Williams sang and played his Silvertone guitar on the sidewalk in front of the WSFA radio studios.

So many listeners contacted the radio station asking <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> [...] "the singing kid" [...] that the producers hired him to host his own 15-minute show twice a week for a weekly salary of US$15 (equivalent to US$0 in [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Upon its release, [...] "Misery" [...] {{received}} a mixed to positive response from music critics. Thomas Hall of The Japan Times described [...] "Misery" [...] as [...] "the type of anthem {{that could possibly}} provide Stefani with her comeback hit." [...] Slant Magazines Cinquemani called the track a [...] "standout" [...] on the parent album, and Mashable's Emily Blake agreed, challenging the listener to [...] "try not to get hooked". Nicholaus James Jodlowski of Reporter magazine claimed: [...] " [...] you're immediately drawn into Gwen's voice. You can hear classic Gwen but a new side of her as well." [...] Similarly, Emilee Lindner of fuseTV complimented the singer for her [...] "bouncy" [...] vocals. Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone applauded the song's lyrics for being [...] "addictive" [...] and [...] "catchy". Regarding the same subject matter, Lucas Villa from AXS praised Stefani for: [...] "continu her streak of solid pop tunes by turning her confessional lyrics into completely delectable hooks". He further stated that [...] "if this is misery, sign us up <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> it please." [...] However, Amanda Bell of MTV News was confused by the lyrical meaning, finding it to be less [...] "straightforward" [...] than the lyrics of her previous single [...] "Make Me Like You".|$|E

500|$|This episode {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Christine Orlando of TV Fanatic {{said that the}} plot of the episode had a [...] "nice story arc when the cause of death ranged from disease, to suicide, and finally murder". She added that Nikki's family was a [...] "nightmare". She was surprised that Bill was not involved in killing Nikki, saying that he [...] "came across as a bit of a jerk for most of the episode", adding that Nikki had a [...] "short, sad life". Orlando praised the detail of Nikki's neck, noticing the bruising to show she was strangled. She said, [...] "I generally hate gore yet I found myself fascinated by the autopsy of the girl's neck. Maybe it was the detail of the muscle and the lack of blood but I've never seen such a procedure portrayed with that level of specificity". Orlando carried on saying, [...] "Is there some rule that we can't have both detectives every week? Detective Baker's definitely growing on me but I missed Bud. He and Megan had some great chemistry and I was hoping <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> {{that by the end of}} the season". Orlando understood Megan's reaction to the fact that Kate was dating Todd, calling it [...] "justified", saying it was an [...] "odd position to be in", but summarized; [...] "she'll just have to get over it". Orlando was worried whether Todd deserved Kate saying that; [...] "the jury is still out on Todd". She praised how this storyline turned out to be a [...] "great bonding moment" [...] between Megan and Lacey, saying she [...] "liked" [...] that Megan was honest with Lacey adding, [...] "I like it when adults actually act like adults".|$|E
500|$|By June 1856 Bazalgette {{completed}} his definitive plans, which provided for small, local sewers about [...] in diameter to feed {{into a series}} of larger sewers until they drained into main outflow pipes [...] high. A Northern and Southern Outfall Sewer were planned to manage the waste for each side of the river. London was mapped into high-, middle- and low-level areas, with a main sewer servicing each; a series of pumping stations was planned to remove the waste towards the east of the city. Bazalgette's plan was based on that of Foster, but was larger in scale, and allowed <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> a rise in population than Foster's– from 3 to 4.5million. Bazalgette submitted his plans to Sir Benjamin Hall, the First Commissioner of Works. Hall had reservations about the outfalls—the discharge points of waste outlets into other bodies of water—from the sewers, which he said were still within the bounds of the capital, and were therefore unacceptable. During the ongoing discussions Bazalgette refined and modified his plans, in line with Hall's demands. In December 1856 Hall submitted the plans to a group of three consultant engineers, Captain Douglas Strutt Galton of the Royal Engineers, James Simpson, an engineer with two water companies, and Thomas Blackwood, the chief engineer on the Kennet and Avon Canal. The trio reported back to Hall in July 1857 with proposed changes to the positions of the outfall, which he passed on to the MBW in October. The new proposed discharge points were to be open sewers, running [...] beyond the positions proposed by the board; the cost of their plans was to be over £5.4million, considerably more than the maximum estimate of Bazalgette's plan, which was £2.4million. In February 1858 a general election saw the fall of Lord Palmerston's Whig government, which was replaced by Lord Derby's second Conservative ministry; Lord John Manners replaced Hall, and Benjamin Disraeli was appointed Leader of the House of Commons and Chancellor of the Exchequer.|$|E
500|$|The EP {{opens with}} [...] "Call Me Maybe", an upbeat track that draws {{influences}} from dance-pop and R. The clever lyrics {{of the song}} describes the [...] "infatuation and inconvenience of a love at first sight," [...] as described by Bill Lamb of About.com. During the pre-chorus, the singer states, [...] "Ripped jeans, skin was showing/Hot night, wind was blowing/Where you think you’re going, baby?" [...] As the chorus begins, the background incorporates synthesized string chords, and she sings, [...] "Hey, I just met you, And this is crazy, But here's my number, So call me maybe." [...] Melody Lau of Rolling Stone wrote that [...] "Call Me Maybe" [...] is a [...] "Taylor Swift meets Robyn" [...] song. The title track, [...] "Curiosity", has a similar sound to [...] "Call Me Maybe", and features heavy dance beats and catchy hooks. In the song, Jepsen sings about being poorly treated by a bad boy, and begs <b>for</b> <b>more</b> <b>of</b> his love. [...] "Picture" [...] is a ballad that focuses on patience in a relationship. Critics noted that the song would work well during the climax of a motion picture due to its lyrical content. [...] "Talk to Me" [...] and [...] "Just a Step Away" [...] were both described as mid-tempo pop songs that alludes to summer love, teen love and that first crush. Fiona Eadie of Cadence Canada noted that in both tracks, Carly is able to transcend the listener [...] "to a porch swing or riding a bicycle along an old dirt road in the countryside’s summer sunshine. Her voice sings the highs and lows of love and everything that comes along with it." [...] The final song is a cover of Joni Mitchell's [...] "Both Sides Now". Musically, the song is also an upbeat ballad, and differs from the original version {{in the sense that}} Jepsen's version is [...] "fresh and modern with her unique bubblegum twist." [...] Critics also added that Jepsen will be able to [...] "attract a new generation to this widely recognized hit" [...] with her [...] "unique version." ...|$|E
