5|$|Several {{other uses}} have been {{researched}} for bupropion. There has been controversy {{about whether it}} is useful to add an antidepressant such as bupropion to a mood stabilizer in people with bipolar depression, but recent reviews have concluded that bupropion in this situation does no significant harm and may sometimes give significant benefit. Bupropion has shown no effectiveness in the treatment of cocaine dependence, but there is weak evidence that it may be useful in treating methamphetamine dependence. Based on studies indicating that bupropion lowers the level of the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediator</b> TNF-alpha, there have been suggestions that it might be useful in treating inflammatory bowel disease or other autoimmune conditions, but very little clinical evidence is available. Bupropion—like other antidepressants, with the exception of duloxetine (Cymbalta)—is not effective in treating chronic low back pain. It does, however, show some promise in the treatment of neuropathic pain.|$|E

However, two schools of thought are emerging: The first proposes that OSM is pro-inflammatory; whilst the other holds the {{opposite}} view, claiming OSM is anti-inflammatory. It {{is important to note}} that before 1997 differences in human and murine OSM receptor usage were unknown. As a result, several investigators utilised human OSM in mouse assays and thus any conclusion drawn from the results of these experiments will be representative of LIF, i.e. signalling through gp130/LIFR complexes.|$|E
2500|$|Although many minor disc herniations heal {{on their}} own with {{conservative}} treatment, occasionally disc herniations require surgery for correction. [...] A primary focus of surgery is to remove pressure or reduce mechanical compression on a neural element— either the spinal cord, or a nerve root. But it is increasingly recognized that back pain, rather than being solely due to compression, may also be due to chemical inflammation. There is evidence that points to a specific <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediator</b> of this pain. This inflammatory molecule, called tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF), is released {{not only by the}} herniated disc, but also in cases of disc tear (annular tear), by facet joints, and in spinal stenosis. In addition to causing pain and inflammation, TNF may also contribute to disc degeneration.|$|E
40|$|Osteoarthritis (OA) is a {{degenerative}} joint disorder involving cartilage {{destruction and}} joint inflammation. Despite extensive research, still much is unknown on the pathogenesis and aetiology of OA. Inflammation and <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> (both local and systemic) are {{key in the}} pathogenesis of OA. For rheumatoid arthritis, multiple therapies are based on targeting the mediators {{that are associated with}} inflammation and joint destruction. Motivated by these findings we set off to identify which <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> play a role in OA and whether interfering with these <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> could stop OA progression or aid in cartilage repair and regeneration. In this thesis we identified multiple <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> and clusters associated with joint inflammation. In a co-culture the mediators produced by OA synovial tissue and cartilage closely resembles the joint environment as measured in OA synovial fluid. Moreover, specific <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> produced by the synovial tissue, such as OSM, are capable of slowing down cartilage repair. When the production of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> was decreased by anti-inflammatory drugs or by interference with specific mediators (i. e. OSM), chondrocyte metabolism was affected and cartilage repair improved. We showed that intervention with the production or activity of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> by synovial tissue plays an import role in cartilage metabolism and maybe could stop OA progression...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInteraction between adipocytes and macrophages {{contributes}} {{to the development of}} insulin resistance in obese adipose tissues. In this study, we examined whether luteolin, food-derived flavonoid, could suppress the production of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> of the interaction between adipocytes and macrophages. Experiments using a coculture system of adipocytes and macrophages showed that luteolin suppressed the production of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators.</b> In addition, activated macrophages were targets for the suppressive effect of luteolin. Luteolin inhibited the phosphorylation of JNK and suppressed the production of <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> in the activated macrophages.

Methods: A total of 70 patients with secretory otitis media in our hospital from January 2014 to August 2015 were selected as the observation group and 70 healthy persons {{in the same period}} were selected as the control group. Then, the serum, ear effusion <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> and blood immune indexes of observation group and the blood indexes of control group were detected, and the serum <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> and blood immune indexes of two groups were compared and the detection results of observation group with different classification and effusion property patients were compared too.

While the serum and ear effusion <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> and blood immune indexes of observation group with different classification and effusion property patients all had significant differences. Conclusions: The serum, ear effusion <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediators</b> and blood immune indexes of patients with secretory otitis media show abnormal state, and the differences of those indexes of patients with different classification and effusion property have significant differences.

50|$|The {{recognition}} and clearance of invading microorganisms occurs through both opsonin-dependent and opsonin-independent pathways. The molecular mechanisms facilitating opsonin-dependent phagocytosis are different for specific opsonin/receptor pairs.

Conversely, complement receptor-mediated pathogen ingestion occurs without observable membrane extensions (particles just sink into the cell) and does not generally results in an <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediator</b> response.|$|E
30|$|Introduction: Severe {{inflammatory}} conditions, as sepsis {{and acute}} respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), are common among critically ill patients.

50|$|Inducing {{experimental}} autoimmune encephalomyelitis {{in animals}} {{as a model}} for multiple sclerosis(MS) has targeted some glutamate receptors as a pathway for potential therapeutic applications. This research has found that a group of drugs interact with the NMDA, AMPA, and kainate glutamate receptor to control neurovascular permeability, <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediator</b> synthesis, and resident glial cell functions including CNS myelination. Oligodendrocytes in the CNS myelinate axons; the myelination dysfunction in MS is partly due to the excitotoxicity of those cells. By regulating the drugs which interact with those glutamate receptors, regulating glutamate binding may be possible, and thereby reduce the levels of Ca2+ influx. The experiments showed improved oligodendrocyte survival, and remyelination increased. Furthermore, CNS inflammation, apoptosis, and axonal damage were reduced.|$|E
50|$|Prostaglandins such as PGE2 can sensitise nociceptors to thermal, {{chemical}} and mechanical stimuli {{and increase the}} excitability of DRG sensory neurons. This occurs because PGE2 modulates the trafficking of Nav1.8 by binding to G-protein-coupled EP2 receptor, which in turn activates protein kinase A. Protein kinase A phosphorylates Nav1.8 at intracellular sites, resulting in increased sodium ion currents. Evidence for a link between PGE2 and hyperalgesia comes from an antisense deoxynucleotide knockdown of Nav1.8 in the DRG of rats. Another modulator of Nav1.8 is the ε isoform of PKC. This isoform is activated by the <b>inflammatory</b> <b>mediator</b> bradykinin and phosphorylates Nav1.8, causing an increase in sodium current in the sensory neurons, which promotes mechanical hyperalgesia.|$|E

Methods: The study included 55 women including 30 newly diagnosed and untreated female RA patients and 25 age-matched healthy individuals as controls. Results: Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESH), C-reactive protein (CRP), IL- 6 and TNF-α levels were significantly higher in RA patients than controls (p 0. 05).
