For example, adding code to count every procedure/routine call will probably have less effect than counting how many times each statement is obeyed. A few computers have special hardware to collect information; in this case the impact on the program is minimal.|$|E

These were addressed in the October 2010 EDP notification, a significant revision. However, residual uncertainties, notably for the year 2009, called for another visit, known as [...] "extended". Its outcome is the November 2010 EDP notification (outside the statutory schedule), which is published in a comprehensive report concluding that [...] "revised data for 2006-2009 are sufficiently reliable for EDP purposes".

50|$|Blinding {{can also}} be used to prevent certain side-channel attacks on {{asymmetric}} encryption schemes. Side-channel attacks allow an adversary to recover information about the input to a cryptographic operation, by measuring something other than the algorithm's result, e.g., power consumption, computation time, or radio-frequency emanations by a device. Typically these attacks depend on the attacker knowing the characteristics of the algorithm, as well as (some) inputs. In this setting, blinding serves to alter the algorithm's input into some unpredictable state. Depending on the characteristics of the blinding function, this can prevent some or all leakage of useful <b>information.</b> <b>Note</b> that security depends also on the resistance of the blinding functions themselves to side-channel attacks.|$|E

5000|$|This {{probability}} has no positive lower bound, {{and can be}} made arbitrarily {{small for}} larger and larger choices of N, or k.
