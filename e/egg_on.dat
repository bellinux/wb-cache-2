5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat dragonfly larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer dragonfly, Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
5|$|The Great Gatsby is a 1925 novel {{written by}} American author F. Scott Fitzgerald that follows {{a cast of}} {{characters}} living in the fictional town of West <b>Egg</b> <b>on</b> prosperous Long Island {{in the summer of}} 1922. The story primarily concerns the young and mysterious millionaire Jay Gatsby and his quixotic passion and obsession for the beautiful former debutante Daisy Buchanan. Considered to be Fitzgerald's magnum opus, The Great Gatsby explores themes of decadence, idealism, resistance to change, social upheaval, and excess, creating a portrait of the Jazz Age or the Roaring Twenties that {{has been described as a}} cautionary tale regarding the American Dream.|$|E
5|$|The male {{selects a}} territory, which he defends against conspecifics, and re-establishes a pair bond with his mate or attracts a new female if necessary. Courtship {{involves}} ritualised flight and ground displays, {{and the male}} often presents a fish to his partner. Most species {{have little or no}} nest, laying the eggs onto bare ground, but Trudeau's tern, Forster's tern and the marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats. Black and lesser noddies build nests of twigs, feathers and excreta on tree branches, and brown, blue, and grey noddies make rough platforms of grass and seaweed on cliff ledges, in cavities or on other rocky surfaces. The Inca tern nests in crevices, caves and disused burrows, such as that of a Humboldt penguin. The white tern is unique in that it lays its single <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> a bare tree branch.|$|E
50|$|Clutch size is 4-9 eggs. Females {{carry the}} <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> their back {{until they are}} fully {{developed}} and hatch as small froglets; {{the male and female}} cooperate to get the <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the female's back.|$|R
50|$|The female lays 400 white <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> grains.|$|R
50|$|The female usually lays its <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> flowers.|$|R
5|$|The terns are {{birds of}} open {{habitats}} that typically breed in noisy colonies and {{lay their eggs}} on bare ground {{with little or no}} nest material. Marsh terns construct floating nests from the vegetation in their wetland habitats, and a few species build simple nests in trees, on cliffs or in crevices. The white tern, uniquely, lays its single <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> a bare tree branch. Depending on the species, one to three eggs make up the clutch. Most species feed on fish caught by diving from flight, but the marsh terns are insect-eaters, and some large terns will supplement their diet with small land vertebrates. Many terns are long-distance migrants, and the Arctic tern may see more daylight in a year than any other animal.|$|E

25|$|Four {{species of}} {{parasitic}} flies prey on gypsy moth larva. Parasetigana silvestris and Exorista larvarum lays an <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> the gypsy moth larva. If that egg hatches before the gypsy moth larva molts, the fly larva will penetrate the host. Compsilura concinnata pierces the gypsy moth larva and deposits its own larva inside. Blepharipa pratensis, lays its eggs on leaves, the gypsy moth larva will consume {{the egg and}} the fly larva will hatch inside its gut.|$|E
25|$|The Daria TV movies Is It Fall Yet? and Is It College Yet? {{were the}} sole two {{authorized}} DVD releases until 2010. Each DVD also includes two episodes from the series, from seasons 4 and 5 respectively, with licensed music removed. The latter disc uses a second-showing MTV version that was shortened by approximately seven minutes, {{rather than the}} original cablecast version. It does, however, include a short clip of a Daria appearance on Beavis and Butt-Head, accessed as a hidden Easter <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> the opening menu (by cycling among menu choices until the highlighting disappears).|$|E

25|$|Sixteen-year-old Subaru Sumeragi, {{the main}} character, {{is a very}} {{powerful}} magician, the thirteenth head of the foremost family of onmyōji in Japan, which has served the Emperor for centuries. As such, he is called upon to solve various occult mysteries, or stumbles himself on people whom his kind nature compels him to help. These occurrences form the main plot of most chapters. He lives in Tokyo with his twin sister Hokuto, an exuberant girl whose chief occupations are to design eccentric clothing for herself and her brother, and to <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> their mutual friend Seishirō Sakurazuka, a kindly, 25-year-old veterinarian, when he declares his love for Subaru.|$|E
25|$|When {{the name}} Yugoslav Airlines first {{appeared}} on aircraft in 1950, the airline had a simple, mainly white livery. During these years there was a Yugoslav flag on the tail, and on the body the words Jugoslovenski Aerotransport. Shortly afterwards the airline changed its livery and added a logo on the tail section with a red shaped <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> the tail in which JAT was written in white. The rest of the tail was blue, with Yugoslav Airlines written on the fuselage in red. There were variations of this livery during the 1960s, 1970s and 1980s. The biggest change in this period was when the first Boeing 737-300 aircraft arrived with a silver body.|$|E
25|$|Serenity was {{released}} on Region 1 DVD, VHS, and UMD on December 20, 2005. The DVD ranked #3 in sales for the week ending December 25, 2005. Bonus features available on the DVD version audio commentary from Whedon, deleted scenes and outtakes, a short introduction by Whedon originally preluding the film at advance screenings, an easter <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> {{the creation of the}} Fruity Oaty Bar commercial, and three featurettes on the Firefly and Serenity universe, special effects, and the revival of the television series to film. Region 2 releases included an additional making-of featurette, and Region 4 releases included additional extended scenes, a tour of the set, a feature on cinematographer Jack Green, and a question and answer session with Whedon filmed after an advance screening in Australia.|$|E
50|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the family}} hung an annual average of 700 new Easter <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the tree, {{but due to}} losses by storm and vandalism, the net annual average {{increase}} was 590 eggs. In 2012 there were over 10,000 <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> the Easter <b>egg</b> tree, and Kraft {{said that he would}} not try to hang more. The tree in Saalfeld does not hold the record for the most <b>eggs</b> <b>on</b> one tree.

500|$|Chef Brian Malarkey opened Searsucker Las Vegas – {{the fourth}} {{branch of the}} {{restaurant}} after San Diego, Del Mar, California, and Austin, Texas – in March 2015. The [...] dining area has a [...] "retro Americana" [...] theme, with [...] "cowboy culture" [...] motifs reflected throughout the furnishings and paintings designed by Thomas Schoos. With signature dishes such as [...] "green eggs and ham" [...] ("braised pork belly with a soft-poached <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> brioche with a brown butter hollandaise"), [...] "38-ounce bone-in ribeye tomahawk steak", [...] "beer-braised short rib", and [...] "shrimp and grits", the restaurant stresses a social dining atmosphere with dishes that {{are meant to be}} shared. Located next to the Omnia nightclub, the restaurant is also taking reservations until 2:00–2:30 AM on weekends and developing a late-night menu with smaller portions, including [...] "hamachi tostada", [...] "cucumber jalapeno ceviche", and [...] "shrimp ceviche". There is seating for 170, including a private dining room and bar.|$|E
500|$|One critic {{points out}} that the {{marketing}} agency Blue Ant is named after the wasp Blue Ant: [...] "it's a wasp with a painful sting. The female hunts for a ground-dwelling cricket. She paralyses it with a sting and lays her <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> it. The still living yet immobile cricket becomes food for the wasp's young. What a clever metaphor for the process of targeting, commodifying, and marketing cool." [...] On the other hand, as Rudy Rucker notes, while new art is constantly threatened by commodification, it is dependent on the monoculture for its launching point and uniqueness. Gibson's product positioning language and Cayce's analysis of consumerist trends show that society is not a victim of consumerism, but rather its creator who helps shape it without ever stepping outside it. [...] Alex Link argues that rather than a simple attack on consumerism outright, the novel outlines a complex interrelationship between art, brand design, and terrorism as varying attitudes to history, terror, and community.|$|E
500|$|Fodor's called The Dime Store [...] "bright and hip", {{offering}} [...] "office {{workers and}} hotel guests a much-appreciated source of seasonally driven, well-prepared comfort fare". Cizmar wrote a positive {{review of the}} restaurant in August 2014, in which he paid tribute to Leo's and described his two $1 extras (an <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> his BLT and maple syrup for his pancakes) as [...] "the best two dollars [...] spent all week". That same month, Thrillist contributor Drew Tyson included the diner in his list of the [...] "11 Best New Restaurants in Portland", writing: Billing itself as a [...] "finer diner", this old-school space feels {{a bit like the}} diner in Twin Peaks. There's a magazine and candy counter in one corner that no one seems to touch; just quick enough service that once you start questioning whether or not you'll get another cup of coffee, one arrives; plus a menu full of classics. All-in-all it's one of the only places you can go in Downtown and feel like you're transported somewhere else entirely.|$|E

500|$|The {{great auk}} was [...] tall and weighed about , {{making it the}} second-largest member of the alcid family (Miomancalla was larger). It had a black back and a white belly. The black beak was heavy and hooked, with grooves on its surface. During summer, great auk plumage showed a white patch over each eye. During winter, the great auk lost these patches, instead {{developing}} a white band stretching between the eyes. The wings were only [...] long, rendering the bird flightless. Instead, the great auk was a powerful swimmer, a trait that it used in hunting. Its favourite prey were fish, including Atlantic menhaden and capelin, and crustaceans. Although agile in the water, it was clumsy on land. Great auk pairs mated for life. They nested in extremely dense and social colonies, laying one <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> bare rock. The egg was white with variable brown marbling. Both parents participated in the incubation of the egg for around 6 weeks before the young hatched. The young left the nest site after 2-3 weeks, although the parents continued to care for it.|$|E
500|$|Sally visits Larry at a DVD {{shop and}} is {{told that he}} has been documenting an [...] "Easter egg" [...] in {{seventeen}} apparently unrelated DVDs. The egg contains video clips of a man calling himself The Doctor, having half of a conversation with the viewer. Larry gives Sally a list of the DVDs and she leaves for the police station. There she meets DI Billy Shipton, who explains that there have been several disappearances at Wester Drumlins and shows her an impound lot containing a locked fake police box. Sally leaves but remembers the Yale key and returns to find that Billy and the phone box have disappeared. She immediately receives a call from a much older Billy, who is on his death bed at the hospital. She visits him and he explains that after she left the lot, he discovered the Angels trying to retrieve the police box. He then suddenly found himself in 1969, where he met the Doctor and was asked to relay a message to Sally decades later. Billy subsequently married and started a video production house that was responsible for putting the Easter <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> the DVDs. Before Billy dies he tells Sally the Doctor's message, which instructs her to look at the list. Sally realises that the list is her own DVD collection and that the Easter egg is meant for her.|$|E
500|$|Besides birds, toads and insectivorous mammals, {{the predators}} of mole crickets include {{subterranean}} assassin bugs, wolf spiders, and various beetles. [...] The South American nematode Steinernema scapterisci kills Neocapteriscus mole crickets by introducing bacteria into their bodies, causing an overwhelming infection. Steinernema neocurtillae {{is native to}} Florida and attacks native Neocurtilla hexadactyla mole crickets. Parasitoid wasps of the genus Larra (Hymenoptera: Crabronidae) attack mole crickets, the female laying an <b>egg</b> <b>on</b> the external surface of the mole cricket, and the larva developing externally on the mole cricket host. Ormia depleta (Diptera: Tachinidae) is a specialized parasitoid of mole crickets in the genus Neoscapteriscus; the fly's larvae hatch from eggs inside her abdomen; she is attracted by {{the call of the}} male mole cricket and deposits a larva or more on any mole cricket individual with which she comes in contact. [...] Specialist predators of mole cricket eggs in China and Japan include the bombardier beetle Stenaptinus jessoensis whereas in South America they include the bombardier beetle Pheropsophus aequinoctialis (Coleoptera: Carabidae); the adult beetle lays eggs near the burrows of mole crickets, and the beetle larvae find their way to the egg chamber and eat the eggs. Fungal diseases can devastate mole cricket populations during winters with sudden rises of temperature and thaws. The fungus Beauveria bassiana can overwhelm adult mole crickets and several other fungal, microsporidian and viral pathogens have been identified.|$|E
