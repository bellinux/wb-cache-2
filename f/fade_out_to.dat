500|$|The {{gameplay}} of Final Fantasy X {{differs from}} that of previous Final Fantasy games in its lack of a top-down perspective world map. Earlier games featured a miniature representation of the expansive areas between towns and other distinct locations, used for long-distance traveling. In Final Fantasy X, almost all the locations are essentially continuous and never <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> a world map. Regional connections are mostly linear, forming a single path through the game's locations, though an airship becomes available late in the game, giving the player the ability to navigate Spira faster. Like previous games in the series, Final Fantasy X features numerous minigames, most notably the fictional underwater sport [...] "blitzball".|$|E

A similar gradient pattern flows down the sleeves. The collar and trim of the shirt is in a darker shade of blue.

5000|$|Neither William Peter Blatty nor William Friedkin—the writer/producer and the director, respectively, of the {{original}} The Exorcist—had any desire to involve themselves in an Exorcist sequel. According to the film's co-producer Richard Lederer, Exorcist II was conceived as a relatively low-budget affair: [...] "What we essentially {{wanted to do with}} the sequel was to redo the first movie... Have the central figure, an investigative priest, interview everyone involved with the exorcism, then <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> unused footage, unused angles from the first film. A low-budget rehash — about $3 million — of The Exorcist, a rather cynical approach to movie-making, I'll admit. But that was the start." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{film was}} edited {{so that the}} {{characters}} only fall off a cliff once. After Bugs and Willoughby fall through the sky in a lengthy sequence, they [...] "put on the brakes" [...] and make a soft, feet-first landing on the ground. Bugs says to the audience, [...] "N'yah, fooled you, didn't we?!" [...] The dog follows with, [...] "Yeah!" [...] just as the cartoon fades out. Willoughby's line and the <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> the end card are usually cut in TV versions (mostly those shown on the Ted Turner-owned cable networks TBS, TNT, Cartoon Network, and Boomerang) {{to cover up the}} fact that the cartoon had been edited in such an abrupt manner prior to release in theaters.|$|E

5000|$|Many mixing points begin or {{end with}} the [...] "drop". The drop is the point in a track where a switch of rhythm or bassline occurs and usually follows a {{recognisable}} build section and [...] "breakdown". Sometimes the drop is used to switch between tracks, layering components of different tracks, though as the two records may be simply ambient breakdowns at this point, though some DJs prefer to combine breakbeats, a more difficult exercise. Some drops are so popular that the DJ will [...] "rewind" [...] or [...] "reload" [...] or [...] "lift up" [...] by spinning the record back and restarting it at the build. [...] "The drop" [...] is often a key point {{from the point of}} view of the dance floor, since the drumbreaks often <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> leave an ambient intro playing. When the beats re-commence they are often more complex and accompanied by a heavier bassline, encouraging the crowd to dance.|$|E
5000|$|Fred Castledine is {{a former}} Australian rules {{football}} player who played for the Swan Districts Football Club in the WAFL throughout the late 1950s and 1960s. His career with Swan Districts commenced in 1958 when the Swans were languishing {{at the bottom of}} the league ladder. He is described as a strong and versatile player with good skills and endurance. The club's fortunes rapidly improved with the appointment of Haydn Bunton, Jr. as senior coach at the end of the 1960 season, after Swan Districts had finished {{at the bottom of the}} ladder. Castletine was a member of perhaps the greatest team that has played for the club and who won the WAFL premiership flag in 1961, 1962 and 1963. In the 1961 Grand Final against East Perth, Castledine played and interesting but important role as a ruck rover. Castledine effectively negated the performance of champion ruckman Graham [...] "Polly" [...] Farmer by engaging in a series of physical engagements that left Keith Slater free to dominate in the ruck contests.In the 1962 Grand Final Castledine also played on the ball as a ruck rover in the victory against East Fremantle. Castledine was moved to the centre half back position for the 1963 Grand Final and played an outstanding game once again so that the Swans were victorious.An important player throughout 1964 Castledine won the Swan Medal for that year. By 1965 Castledine had become the captain/coach of Swan Districts and remained in that position for the 1966 and 1967 seasons. Swan Districts finished as minor premiers by being at the top of the ladder at the end the 1965 season made it as far as the Grand Final in 1965 but lost the game in a third quarter <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> East Fremantle. A valuable contributor to the team and a great clubman, Fred Castledine played 162 games for Swan Districts from 1958-1969. He also represented the WA state team in 1961-1964 and was selected at centre half back in the Swan Districts team of the century.|$|E
5000|$|Despite the series' popularity, the series' ratings {{never made}} the top thirty in the yearly ratings charts. The Big Valley was {{canceled}} in 1969 as the TV western craze began to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make room for more modern series. In Ella Smith's 1973 biography, [...] "Starring Miss Barbara Stanwyck", Smith noted that The Big Valley had been cancelled by ABC mainly due to a poor time slot. In better times, the series had been enough of a hit to outlive various time slot rivals during its run (mainly on Monday nights at 10 p.m.), including The Jean Arthur Show, Run for Your Life and I Spy. According to Broadcasting magazine (September 27, 1965), its debut episode (actually Wednesday at 9 p.m., where the series aired for half-a-season) placed 39th in the Nielsen ratings for the week of September 13-19, 1965. The Big Valley was also ranked {{as one of the}} top five favourite new shows in viewer TVQ polling (the others were Get Smart, I Dream of Jeannie, Lost in Space and F Troop). Early into its second season, The Big Valley was still a mid-range performer, placing 47th out of just 88 series during the week of October 28, 1966, which was higher than such shows as That Girl, Daniel Boone, Petticoat Junction and The Wild Wild West. Even so, The Big Valley was popular enough to warrant at least three TV Guide covers. It also acted as a launching pad for two projected spin-offs from special episodes. A 1968 episode guest starring Van Williams was meant to lead to a Rifleman-like series titled Rimfire. A March 1969 episode, The Royal Road, guest-starring heartthrob Sajid Khan as a young rogue, was also hoped to lead to a series. But by that year the rising popularity of CBS's The Carol Burnett Show — and vocal complaints by Joey Bishop, ABC's late-night talk show host, that the show's faltering ratings weren't helping to provide his program with a proper lead-in — ultimately led to the drama's demise. In syndication, The Big Valley would prove exceptionally popular in the United States, Europe and Latin America. In the comedy film Airplane! (1980), the wacky air traffic controller Johnny, played by Stephen Stucker, paid homage to Big Valleys penchant for big drama in one of his many asides. After Lloyd Bridges' character frets about a pilot who cracked under pressure, Johnny says: [...] "It happened to Barbara Stanwyck!" [...] and [...] "Nick, Heath, Jarrod - there's a fire in the barn!" [...] The Big Valley has also seeped into the darker cinematic subconscious. In Bug, an acclaimed 2006 thriller starring Ashley Judd and Michael Shannon as drug addicts, their characters spiral into a hallucination that leads them to imagine tiny bugs have invaded their dwelling, with one referring to the little critters as [...] "matriarchal aphids" [...] that act [...] "like Barbara Stanwyck in Big Valley." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} USD/KRW spot market is efficient in processing new information by employing both the Runs Test and the foreigners' securities trading rule profitability approach. Excluding {{the period of}} 2008 financial crisis, the USD/KRW spot market is efficient in terms of close rates, but not efficient in terms of open rates. The foreigners' securities trading rule can also produce statistically significant profits if the trades are based on open prices, though not high. This implies that traders can predict future exchange rates, to some degree, with the information on foreign net purchases of securities in the Korean stock/ bond markets. If we consider the related interest differentials and transaction costs, however, the profits <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> marginal level or below. This result implies that traders can expect the existence of predictability in the USD/KRW spot market, but not profitability...|$|E
40|$|Where are cinemas going? Are they {{an evening}} out, a festive occasion, {{something}} of a 'luxury' {{when compared to the}} parallel availability of television? Are we looking at fewer cinemas, with more advanced technical standards, itself again a reflection of urban reorganization? Are cinemas changing to a means of education like the IMAX that shows a variety of documentary films? Or are cinemas going to <b>fade</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> make place for the comfort and ease of the cinema in your own living room? The goal of the project is to design a cinema centre that is original and offers the user a new and exciting experience. The cinema is based on the film and information technology industry especially new and future technological trends. The main focus, however, is the user's experience through the space and how it can be enhanced through the use of technology. The aim is {{to create a sense of}} voyeurism, which exemplifies the user's experience in the cinema auditorium and in the rest of the building by creating passing glipmses, which combine activity and object. The cinema centre will provide a space of invention, innovation and experience. Dissertation (MInt(Prof)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007. Architectureunrestricte...|$|E
