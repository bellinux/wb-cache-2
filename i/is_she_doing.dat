500|$|I love Brett {{because he}} is like me. If I'm {{eternally}} 12 -- because he's {{a little bit more}} naughty than I am -- he's eternally 15. He has a great sense of humor, obviously, and he knows that I {{have a sense of humor}} and he feels that people don't recognize that about me. And I'll do stuff that I'm totally joking and they're like (uses mean girl voice), [...] "Why <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> that? Why <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> the treadmill with her high heels on?" [...] I'm like, [...] "It's a freakin' joke! It's 'Cribs'! Hello! It's a freakin' joke!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Stefani {{believed}} {{that some of}} the fans of No Doubt would be upset with her solo effort, commenting, [...] " [...] were probably like, 'Why <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> this record? She's going to ruin everything'." [...] She revealed that she too did not know why she was recording a solo album. For the remainder of the evening, Stefani and Williams incorporated this inspiration into the lyrics that eventually became [...] "Hollaback Girl". The two decided that Stefani did not have to have an answer for her intentions and that the choices she made were based on what she felt was wrong or right. On its creation, Stefani said, [...] "To me, it is the freshest attitude song I've heard in so long." [...] Williams was pleased with the song, commenting, [...] "Gwen is like the girl in high school who just had her own style." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I shouldn't {{know what}} to say, either," [...] replied Janet. She smiled, but she had an odd desire to cry. [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here?" ...|$|E
60|$|What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> looking fixedly {{into one}} of the corners of the room.|$|R
60|$|Had it not <b>been</b> that <b>she</b> <b>did</b> {{not dare}} {{to do that}} for the son which she had refused to the mother, I think that she would have given way. As it <b>was,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know how to yield, after having persevered so long.|$|R
6000|$|Ant. What {{manner of}} woman <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> not want {{two of the}} four elements? has she any thing about her but air and fire? ...|$|R
6000|$|He saw Valentine's smile, {{and broke}} off abruptly. [...] "Anyway, it doesn't {{matter in the}} least to either of us. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here, and who are the others?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes... Dear me! Arabella not in {{the depths}} of London, but down here! It is only a little over a dozen miles across the country to Alfredston. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then {{you know}} the girl? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now?" [...] asked Miss Ellery, who had lost {{a part of the}} story as she sat in a shadowy nook with the pensive Fred.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes!" [...] she cried. [...] "Of course, I {{remember}} all about it. The young lady {{who was with}} you--what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there? Where <b>is</b> <b>she</b> now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, then, may <b>be</b> <b>she's</b> <b>doing</b> {{it because}} <b>she</b> hates you--doing {{it for her}} soul's good--sort of penance, sort of atonement to Mavering." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{gradually}} the heaviness {{of her heart}} pressed and pressed into consciousness. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Was <b>she</b> bearing a child? Bearing a child? To what? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And what if I did kill him?" [...] {{said the}} {{prisoner}} savagely; [...] "what's that to you, you young hell-cat? Guard!--damnation!--what do {{you let her}} come here for? Do you hear? Guard!" [...] he screamed, rising in a transport of passion, [...] "take her away! fling her downstairs! What the h--ll <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Sylvia! What is it? Who is it? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> to you?" [...] began Mary; {{but before}} the words were out of her mouth, the thing had flown at her neck, and pulled her down too; and the grasp and the {{clinging}} and the kisses told her long before she had room or eyes or voice to know the creature by. A sort of sobbing out of each name between them {{was all that was}} heard at first.|$|E
60|$|Abby, I think {{often about}} you and the {{pleasant}} days, the visits I used to pay you, and how good it was always to be made so welcome. O, I wish I could come in this afternoon {{and have a good}} tea with you, and have three or four hours of mutual comfort, and rest and talk, and be all of us together again. Is Helen home and well? and what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> now? And you, my dear friend, how sorry I am to hear that your health is not rugged--but, dear Abby, you must not dwell on anticipations of the worst (but I know that is not your nature, or did not use to be). I hope this will find you quite well and in good spirits. I feel so well myself--I will have to come and see you, I think--I am so fat, out considerable in the open air, and all red and tanned worse than ever. You see, therefore, that my life amid these sad and death-stricken hospitals has not told upon me, for I am this fall so running over with health, and I feel as if I ought to go on, on that account, working among all the sick and deficient; and O how gladly I would bestow upon you a liberal share of my health, dear Abby, if such a thing were possible.|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot tell. I {{only know}} I have a horror of her, a sudden {{shrinking}} whenever {{her name is}} mentioned. Who <b>was</b> <b>she,</b> <b>do</b> you suppose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not as I do! To {{say that}} is nonsense, Bell; of course <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not love him as I do. But the truth <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not love him at all. Do you think I cannot see it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I hardly {{heard what}} it <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> say," [...] said Harold Smith; [...] "so I could not answer her, you know. Something about Sundays, I believe." ...|$|R

50|$|Elena {{comes home}} and finds Damon {{on his way}} out. The two {{of them have a}} talk with Damon opening up and thanking her for saving him today. They end up kissing when Jenna (Sara Canning) opens the door and sees them. Jenna orders Elena to come inside and she closes the door behind her asking Elena what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> but Elena does not want to talk about it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, do tell {{us about}} her. Who <b>is</b> <b>she?</b> <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> perform for a living? What kind of a person are we to expect?" [...] volleyed Miss Brush.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah {{there it}} <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>does</b> care. But it isn't, is it," [...] Miss Barrace considerately added, [...] "as {{if you had}} ever had any doubt of that?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Leslie {{seemed very}} quiet tonight, didn't she?" [...] said Gilbert, {{when he and}} Anne reached home. [...] "What in the world <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> over there on the bar alone?" ...|$|R
5000|$|That {{was just}} a sort of nice line that I made into a song. It was about me and Yoko. Everybody seemed to be {{paranoid}} except for us two, {{who were in the}} glow of love. Everything is clear and open when you're in love. Everybody was sort of tense around us: you know, 'What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> here at the session? Why is she with him?' All this sort of madness is going on around us because we just happened to want to be together all the time. John Lennon, All We Are Saying ...|$|E
5000|$|Why is it we {{have the}} ugliest money of all civilized nations? The design is poor, commonplace, tasteless, characterless, and the {{execution}} is like thereunto. They have rather the appearance of tokens or mean medals. One {{reason for this is}} that the design is so inartistic, and so insignificant. That young woman sitting on nothing in particular, wearing nothing to speak of, looking over her shoulder at nothing imaginable, and bearing in her left hand something that looks like a broomstick with a woolen nightcap on itâ€”what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> there? ...|$|E
5000|$|In {{the final}} scene, Dallas is again in Sean's bed when {{he enters the}} room, and they reprise the {{dialogue}} from their first meeting. As before, Pockets also comes in drunk and again asks Sean [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> in your bed?" [...] But this time, Sean announces [...] "We got married today!" [...] After Sean herds Pockets out of their room, Tembo and his two brothers push their way in and break Sean's bed as the newlyweds {{try to figure out}} how to deal with them.|$|E
50|$|Allen is a non-lineage {{micaceous}} pottery artist, that <b>is,</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> {{not come}} {{from a long line}} of Jicarilla Apache potters. Nonetheless <b>she</b> <b>is</b> interested in sustaining this tradition for the next generation of Jicarilla Apaches.|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>is,</b> I swear <b>she</b> <b>is!</b> <b>She's</b> <b>doing</b> it again! <b>She's</b> {{stopping}} the carriage. Oh, {{go out and}} see what she wants! Don't {{you know that a}} queen's wish is a command? You've got to go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Handsome and young!" [...] The judge's eyes {{took on a}} musing expression. [...] "Well, well! that {{accounts}} for much. But what <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> {{up there in the}} company of that old Dutchman?" ...|$|R
50|$|However, {{keeping with}} the {{assertion}} made in Full Circle (1978) that a man's spontaneous attraction to a woman does not come with strings attached, Bryn, in The Man from Tripoli (1979), doesn't apologise to Lisa for flirting with other women. And Dave, in The Iron Man (1974), answers Kim's question of marital infidelity with a question of his own that if another woman takes undue interest in him, then what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing</b> about it? Kay weaves this complexity into the couple's relationship to counter the paranoia she finds in women of jumping to suspect their partners of infidelity.|$|E
50|$|Lorna Gibb in The Independent commented:Kate Clanchy's new book, What <b>Is</b> <b>She</b> <b>Doing</b> Here?, can be {{described}} as a memoir of her relationship with a Kosovan refugee, Antigona, but it is much more than that. Antigona escapes from her devastated village by way of Italy to London, where she meets, befriends and is employed by Clanchy. The bond between the two women is fraught but strong, caught in the contradiction of their roles as employer, employee and friend. But, as Clanchy finds the words to write Antigona's story, we begin to hear Antigona's own voice, one that both educates and angers the narrator, and, above all, makes her question many things about her life.|$|E
5000|$|On the {{day after}} the shooting, Donald Trump, {{appearing}} on Fox & Friends, questioned Geller's motives. He said, [...] "It looks like she's just taunting everybody. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>doing?</b> Drawing Mohammed and it looks like she's actually taunting people. (...) You know, I'm one that believes in free speech, probably more than she does. But what's the purpose of this?" [...] In response to Trump's remarks, Bill O'Reilly said in his program The O'Reilly Factor, [...] "Mr. Trump is correct. By setting up a contest and awarding $10,000 for a depiction of the Prophet Mohammed, the American Freedom Defense Initiative spurred a violent attack. (...) Insulting a religion with more than a billion followers does not advance the cause of defeating the fanatical jihadists. It hurts the cause." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not in society," [...] responded Mrs. Brimmer, with a sigh, [...] "and I do not {{remember}} to have met the lady before. The fact <b>is,</b> <b>she</b> <b>does</b> not move in our circle--in the upper classes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing very much," [...] {{answered}} Dick, before {{either of}} his brothers could speak. [...] "A girl saw a man leaving the building {{the evening of the}} robbery, but who he <b>was,</b> <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not know." ...|$|R
