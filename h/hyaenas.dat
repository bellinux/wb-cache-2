500|$|The serval is {{vulnerable}} to <b>hyaenas</b> and wild dogs. It will seek cover to escape their view, and, if the predator is very close, immediately flee in long leaps, changing its direction frequently and with the tail raised. The serval is an efficient, though not frequent, climber; an individual was observed to have climbed a tree to a height of more than [...] to escape dogs. Like many cats, the serval is able to purr; {{it also has a}} high-pitched chirp, and can hiss, cackle, growl, grunt and meow.|$|E
500|$|Springbok {{often go}} into bouts of {{repeated}} high leaps {{of up to}} [...] into the air – a practice known as pronking (derived from the Afrikaans pronk, [...] "to show off") or stotting. In pronking, the springbok performs multiple leaps into the air in a stiff-legged posture, with the back bowed and the white flap lifted. When the male shows off his strength to attract a mate, or to ward off predators, he starts off in a stiff-legged trot, leaping into the air with an arched back every few paces and lifting the flap along his back. Lifting the flap causes the long white hairs under the tail to stand up in a conspicuous fan shape, which in turn emits a strong scent of sweat. Although the exact cause of this behaviour is unknown, springbok exhibit this activity when they are nervous or otherwise excited. The most accepted theory for pronking {{is that it is}} a method to raise alarm against a potential predator or confuse it, or to get a better view of a concealed predator; it may also be used for display. Springbok are very fast antelopes, clocked at [...] They generally tend to be ignored by carnivores unless they are breeding. Caracals, cheetahs, leopards, spotted <b>hyaenas,</b> and wild dogs are major predators of the springbok. Southern African wildcats, black-backed jackals, black eagles, martial eagles, and tawny eagles target juveniles. Springbok are generally quiet animals, though they may make occasional low-pitched bellows as a greeting and high-pitched snorts when alarmed.|$|E

40|$|We report {{densities of}} spotted <b>hyaena</b> (Crocuta crocuta) and African golden wolf (Canis anthus) in Enderta {{district}} in northern Ethiopia with high human and low natural prey densities. We estimated spotted <b>hyaena</b> and African golden wolf abundance and characterized their spatial distribution with three methods: we surveyed four road-transects for 66 nights during dry (n= 41) and wet (n= 25) seasons, we used 34 calling stations and we mapped all active spotted <b>hyaena</b> dens {{at the time}} of the survey. The density of spotted <b>hyaena</b> and African golden wolf increased with proximity to towns where human density was higher. A total of 562 spotted <b>hyaena</b> and 63 African golden wolf responded to calling stations, leading to estimates of 1, 145 spotted <b>hyaena</b> and 166 African golden wolf in Enderta district. This method also found a significantly higher spotted <b>hyaena</b> and African golden wolf abundance in high human density areas. Maximum response radius was 2. 8 km for spotted <b>hyaena</b> and 2. 5 km for African golden wolf, and response probability was 0. 83 for spotted <b>hyaena</b> and 0. 8 for African golden wolf, respectively. We found 40 active spotted <b>hyaena</b> dens with 1, 507 remnants of prey, and the majority of the dens were located close to rivers and villages. Our findings show a positive relationship between spotted <b>hyaena,</b> African golden wolf and human concentrations that might demonstrate a case of exceptional coexistence of humans and carnivores, both at high densities. We suggest further investigations into co-adaptations between humans and predators in the study area...|$|R
50|$|<b>Hyaena</b> is a genus {{comprising}} two of {{the living}} species of hyenas: the striped hyena (<b>Hyaena</b> <b>hyaena)</b> from western Asia and northern Africa and the brown hyena (<b>Hyaena</b> brunnea) from southern Africa.

The male brown hyena is slightly larger than the female, while the sexes of the striped hyena are equally sized. Both species are smaller than the spotted hyena, but larger than the aardwolf.

40|$|Determining {{carnivore}} {{diets and}} how they may change over time is important if the management of large carnivores is successful in an enclosed reserve. Carnivore diets are known to shift over time {{in response to a}} variety of factors. These factors include prey availability and climatic conditions (rainfall patterns). The re-introduction of lions (Panthera leo) and spotted <b>hyaena</b> (Crocuta crocuta) to Addo Elephant National Park (AENP), South Africa provided the opportunity to study diet trends of lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> in an enclosed system. The study focused on the diets and overlap of lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> and how their prey selection changed since their re-introduction in 2003 to 2010. The database included scats collected over a seven year period. A total of 195 spotted <b>hyaena</b> scats and 217 lion scats were analysed using scat analysis. Prey items estimated from scat samples were coupled with prey availabilities to determine preferred prey items. Additionally, from determined carnivore diets, lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> diet overlap was estimated over time. Lions preferred prey items which included zebra (Equus quagga) and eland (Tragelaphus oryx) during the early portion of the study. Over time preference shifted to include buffalo (Syncerus caffer), bushbuck (Tragelaphus scriptus) and grey duiker (Sylvicapra grimmia). Spotted <b>hyaena</b> preferred zebra and eland in the earlier part of the study, then over time, shifting their selection to grey duiker, buffalo, red hartebeest (Alcephalus busephalus) and bushbuck. Lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> had a similar diet which increased in overlap during the study (67 percentage - 91 percentage). Our findings suggest that lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> had a degree of diet specialization; both carnivores avoided and preferred certain prey items relative to their abundance. Their preference excluded the most abundant prey items, thus causing a decline in abundance of rarer species over time. Lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> did not respond by shifting their diets to consume abundant prey items when their preferred prey items declined in availability. However, this study may be a snap-shot of carnivore’s diet trends. Thus further monitoring of the large carnivore diets should be researched in order to determine which factors drive their prey selection. Additionally, lions and spotted <b>hyaena</b> diet overlap increased overtime. The high diet overlap may be a result from spotted <b>hyaena</b> scavenging off lion kills, thus spotted <b>hyaena</b> diets may be facilitated by lion kills. Finally our data suggests that re-introduced large carnivores in AENP are likely to change the composition of the overall mammal community, potentially eliminating rare but preferred prey species in an enclosed reserve...|$|R
