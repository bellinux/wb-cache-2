40|$|This study {{analyzes}} {{the impact of}} trade on wages {{in the context of}} the specific factor model by focusing on the link between trade and the average real wage. A recent paper by Jones & Ruffin (2008) shows how one can use the specific factor model to predict how labor should fare from an improvement in the terms of trade, an increase in the price of exportables relative to importables. For this purpose, I use annual firm-level data on the manufacturing sector in Tanzania during the period 1992 to 1998. I find that a ceteris paribus increase in the price of <b>exportables</b> may <b>benefit</b> labor in the food-beverage industry but hurt labor in the textile-garment, wood-furniture and metal-machinery industries. There are industries where the specific factor model predicts that exporting would help workers, but where the Stolper-Samuelson theorem of the Hecksher-Ohlin model predicts the reverse. Specific factor model, wages, terms of trade, elasticity of substitution,...|$|R

This paper is a quantitative attempt to summarize {{the current state of}} debate; meta-analysis is used to combine the disparate estimates. The chief findings are that: a) the hypothesis that there is no effect of currency union on trade can be rejected at standard significance levels; b) the combined estimate implies that currency union approximately doubles trade; and c) the estimates are heterogeneous and not consistently tied to features of the studies. While there are costs and caveats, the scale of these <b>benefits</b> <b>means</b> that Singapore should consider currency union. JEL Classification Number: F 3...|$|R
5000|$|Sainfoin {{provides}} a superb forage for grazing animals and voluntary intake of sainfoin by cattle and sheep is 20% {{higher than for}} grass. Unlike many other legumes, it is non-bloating and {{is known to have}} anthelmintic properties, so reducing the problems associated with livestock worms. Sainfoin contains condensed tannins, and it is these that protect animals against bloat. Sainfoin has also been shown to increase protein absorption. This, combined with its other health <b>benefits,</b> <b>mean</b> that animals grazing sainfoin have very rapid liveweight gains, so young stock can be finished sooner and with very good carcass grades. Sainfoin is therefore extremely useful to low input and organic farmers. Yields can be very high at around 16t DM per hectare.|$|R

Random effects analyses, based on 49 studies (24, 477 participants, 12 - 20  years old), revealed that community service had positive effects on academic, personal, social, and civic outcomes. Moderation analyses indicated that reflection was essential; the effect for studies that include reflection was substantial (mean ES = . 41) while community service {{in the absence of}} reflection yielded negligible <b>benefits</b> (<b>mean</b> ES = . 05). Effects increased when studies include more frequent reflection and community service, reflection on academic content, and older adolescents.

This paper argues that this consideration should be explicit and consistent across policy areas. The most conceptually valid approach to the valuation of benefits from reduced risk is to base estimates on the required compensation for exposure to risk. An empirical estimate of required compensation is generated by measuring the statistical value of life based on data from the Canadian labor market. The estimated value of life is $ 5. 2 million in 1983 dollars. This is recommended as a useful lower bound estimate for a variety of public policy applications in Canada. In some applications, we argue that substantially higher values are required. ...|$|R
5000|$|Nevertheless, recent {{developments}} in the co-operative movement have started to shift thinking more clearly towards multi-stakeholder perspectives. This has resulted in repeated attempts to develop model rules that differentiate control rights from investment and profit-sharing rights. Workers' co-operatives have often been seen as an alternative or [...] "third way" [...] to the domination of labour by either capital or the state (see below for a comparison). Co-operatives traditionally combine social benefit interests with capitalistic property-right interests.

We analyse the redistributive effects of the fiscal system for the year 2013 and of the fiscal system that has been functioning since 1 st January 2014. We find that the redistributive effect reduces income inequality by about 50 % in both observed years. Social benefits create 98 % of vertical redistribution (2013), whereas personal taxes initiate 2 % (2013). State pensions, means-tested social benefits, and social security contributions are most important in reducing inequality in Serbia (2013). The partial fiscal reform (2014) has not changed the rank of the focused fiscal instruments...|$|R
40|$|The {{focus of}} this article is the effect on {{adolescent}} girls’ roles and responsibilities of public works schemes or cash transfers, which are the main forms of social protection in developing countries. Increasing participation in social protection is intended to enhance the development of girls in participating households, but evidence on their school participation and workloads suggests that the reverse may be happening. The article probes what happens to girls’ roles and responsibilities when households participate in social protection schemes in rural Ethiopia and Andhra Pradesh. It argues that effects are complex, and often context-specific; however, the assumption that ‘beneficiaries’ <b>benefit</b> <b>means</b> that negative impacts are rarely acknowledged. The article combines a review of other papers addressing the effects of social protection on children’s work with analysis of quantitative and qualitative data, recognising that this question cannot be answered with a methodology that considers girls’ schooling or workloads in isolation...|$|R
40|$|In {{a global}} economy, {{paternity}} leave policies represent {{one of the}} most significant expansions of the welfare state that seek to help fathers respond to socio-economic pressures on their work and families. Policy makers who strongly promote socio-economic equity may respond to these global changes with new policy formulae meant to encourage involvement of fathers in their families. Nevertheless, scholars have limited understanding of who benefits from paternity leave policies and what these <b>benefits</b> <b>mean</b> to families. The present study is a comparative analysis of paternity leave policies across forty-four countries. This paper first presents a typology of paternity leave policies. This typology consists of seven criteria that range from duration of benefits to amount of benefits to employment security. This typology is then applied to forty-four countries. The present study demonstrates that a surprisingly small number of countries are devoted to family equity...|$|R
