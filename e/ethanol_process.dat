First, the morphological structures of the yeast at different [Bmim]Cl concentrations were observed under an optical microscope. The results show that its single cell morphology remained unchanged at all [Bmim]Cl concentrations, but its reproduction rate by budding decreased with the [Bmim]Cl concentration increasing. Then its growth during <b>ethanol</b> fermentation <b>process</b> at different [Bmim]Cl concentrations was examined. The {{results indicated that the}} ionic liquid [Bmim]Cl inhibited the yeast growth.

40|$|Bioethanol from {{sugarcane}} is {{a sustainable}} alternative to fossil fuels, {{and the increasing}} demand for fuel ethanol has prompted studies {{on the use of}} the lignocellulosic residues of sugarcane, namely bagasse and leaves, as new feedstock. This thesis describes various process designs and the economic feasibility of producing second generation (2 G) ethanol from bagasse and leaves via the enzymatic route in an integrated sugarcane biorefinery, where first-generation (1 G) ethanol is produced from sugarcane sugar. Techno-economic analysis have been performed for the Brazilian context to evaluate the influence of several process designs and the main production factors on the 2 G <b>ethanol</b> <b>process,</b> in terms of energy efficiency, 2 G ethanol production cost(2 G MESP) and profitability. The study of process design focused on ways to integrate the 1 G and 2 G ethanol processes, and on configurations to hydrolyse and ferment bagasse. The existing 1 G <b>ethanol</b> <b>process</b> and the proposed 2 G <b>ethanol</b> <b>process</b> were combined in a single plant by integration of thermal and material streams. The resulting synergies could improve the use of feedstock and reduce the 2 G ethanol production cost. Simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) and time-separated hydrolysis and fermentation (tSHF) were the configurations investigated experimentally for the production of 2 G ethanol from bagasse. In an attempt to increase the ethanol concentration before distillation, the fermented liquid of tSHF was also recirculated back to tSHF. The tSHF configurations showed a lower 2 G MESP than SSF. Process options were also investigated considering the pentose use and the addition of leaves to the 1 G+ 2 G process. Pentoses can either be fermented to ethanol or anaerobically digested to produce electricity from biogas combustion, and in the former case the highest potential reduction in 2 G MESP could be achieved. The addition of leaves could improve the overall profitability of the 1 G+ 2 G process. Residence time and water-insoluble solids (WIS) loading in hydrolysis were the main process conditions considered together with costing factors, such as enzyme, sugarcane and leaves costs. The selling price of electricity and ethanol were found to have relevant impacts on the profitability of the 1 G+ 2 G <b>ethanol</b> <b>process.</b> Among the numerous operating conditions studied for the 2 G <b>ethanol</b> <b>process,</b> the cases showing the best trade-off between technical and economic feasibility were also tested experimentally on laboratory scale obtaining promising results.

The DOE is also aiding {{development of a}} viable ethanol fuel industry. One important point of the ethanol program is to encourage use of non-fossil fuels, such as geothermal energy, as process heat to manufacture ethanol. Geothermal waters available in the eastern US tend to be lower in temperature (180 F or less) than those available in the western states (above 250 F). Technically feasible use of eastern geothermal energy for <b>ethanol</b> <b>process</b> heat requires use of technology that lowers <b>ethanol</b> <b>process</b> temperature requirements. Vacuum (subatmospheric) distillation is one such technology. This study, then, addresses technical feasibility of use of geothermal energy to provide process heat to ethanol distillation units operated at vacuum pressures. They conducted this study by performing energy balances on conventional and vacuum ethanol processes of ten million gallons per year size. Energy and temperature requirements for these processes {{were obtained from the}} literature or were estimated (for process units or technologies not covered in available literature). Data on available temperature and energy of eastern geothermal resources was obtained from the literature. These data were compared to <b>ethanol</b> <b>process</b> requirements, assuming a 150 F geothermal resource temperature. Conventional ethanol processes require temperatures of 221 F for mash cooking to 240 F for stripping. Fermentation, conducted at 90 F, is exothermic and requires no process heat. All temperature requirements except those for fermentation exceed assumed geothermal temperatures of 150 F. They assumed a 130 millimeter distillation pressure for the vacuum process. It requires temperatures of 221 F for mash cooking and 140 F for distillation. Data indicate lower energy requirements for the vacuum <b>ethanol</b> <b>process</b> (30 million BTUs per hour) than for the conventional process (36 million BTUs per hour). Lower energy requirements result from improved process energy recovery. Data examined in this study indicate feasible use of eastern geothermal heated waters (150 F) to provide process heat for vacuum (130 mm Hg) ethanol distillation units. Data indicate additional heat sources are needed to raise geothermal temperatures to the 200 F level required by mash cooking. Data also indicate potential savings in overall process energy use through use of vacuum distillation technology. Further study is needed to confirm conclusions reached during this study. Additional work includes obtaining energy use data from vacuum ethanol distillation units currently operating in the 130 millimeter pressure range; economic analysis of different vacuum pressures to select an optimum; and operation of a pilot geothermally heated vacuum column to produce confirmatory process data...|$|E
