2500|$|As a <b>general</b> <b>manufacturing</b> process swaging may {{be broken}} up into two categories. The first {{category}} of swaging involves extrusion of the workpiece, forcing {{it through a}} confining die to reduce its diameter, similar {{to the process of}} drawing wire.

This process is usually called [...] "rotary swaging" [...] or [...] "radial forging".|$|E

2500|$|By 1922, {{more than}} a {{thousand}} steamships lay idle in the United States alone, and work in the shipbuilding industry was virtually nonexistent. When the last of the USSB orders rolled off the ways at Bristol, Harriman transferred the yard back to the ownership of the EFC, but he attempted to keep the Chester yard open by diversifying his product line. The MSC announced that it would diversify into [...] "steel construction in <b>general,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and power plant equipment, machinery and machine work, railroad equipment and material, and plate shop works." [...] Due to increasing specialization however, the era in which shipbuilding companies could readily diversify into other fields had passed. Harriman was forced to close the Chester shipyard in 1923, and the Merchant Shipbuilding Corporation was subsequently transformed into an investment vehicle known as Merchant-Sterling.|$|E
