5|$|Along with Senators Ted Kennedy and Orrin Hatch, Clinton was a {{force behind}} {{the passage of the}} State Children's Health Insurance Program in 1997, a federal bill that gave state support to {{children}} whose parents could not provide them <b>health</b> <b>coverage</b> and conducted outreach efforts on behalf of enrolling children in the program once it became law. She promoted nationwide immunization against childhood diseases and encouraged older women to get a mammogram for breast cancer screening, with coverage provided by Medicare. She successfully sought to increase research funding for prostate cancer and childhood asthma at the National Institutes of Health. The First Lady worked to investigate reports of an illness that affected veterans of the Gulf War, which became known as the Gulf War syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{called for}} Congress to pass {{legislation}} reforming {{health care in the}} United States, a key campaign promise and a top legislative goal. He proposed an expansion of health insurance coverage to cover the uninsured, to cap premium increases, and to allow people to retain their coverage when they leave or change jobs. His proposal was to spend $900billion over 10 years and include a government insurance plan, also known as the public option, to compete with the corporate insurance sector as a main component to lowering costs and improving quality of health care. It would also make it illegal for insurers to drop sick people or deny them coverage for pre-existing conditions, and require every American to carry <b>health</b> <b>coverage.</b> The plan also includes medical spending cuts and taxes on insurance companies that offer expensive plans.|$|E
5|$|In the January 1997 State of the Union address, Clinton {{proposed}} a new initiative to provide <b>health</b> <b>coverage</b> {{to up to}} five million children. Senators Ted Kennedy—a Democrat—and Orrin Hatch—a Republican—teamed up with Hillary Rodham Clinton and her staff in 1997, and succeeded in passing legislation forming the State Children's Health Insurance Program (SCHIP), the largest (successful) health care reform in {{the years of the}} Clinton Presidency. That year, Hillary Clinton shepherded through Congress the Adoption and Safe Families Act and two years later she succeeded in helping pass the Foster Care Independence Act. He negotiated the passage of the Balanced Budget Act of 1997 by the Republican Congress. In October 1997, he announced he was getting hearing aids, due to hearing loss attributed to his age, and his time spent as a musician in his youth. In 1999 Clinton signed into law the Financial Services Modernization Act also known as the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed the part of the Glass–Steagall Act that had prohibited a bank from offering a full range of investment, commercial banking, and insurance services since its enactment in 1933.|$|E

40|$|In March 2001, {{the longest}} {{economic}} expansion in U. S. history ended, and an economic recession began. This paper seeks {{to provide a}} better understanding of the historical relationship between macroeconomic variables and <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage.</b> We use data from two nationally representative samples: the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) and the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth (NLSY). The longitudinal nature of our data allows us to remove individual-specific, time-invariant heterogeneity and to focus on changes in health insurance status in response to changes in macroeconomic variables. The results confirm our prediction that the probability of any <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> is negatively associated with unemployment rate. We find that a one percentage point increase in the state unemployment rate is associated with a decrease in the probability of <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage,</b> through any source, of 0. 62 percent for men, 0. 54 percent for women, and 1. 1 percent for children. However, our prediction that an indicator variable for national recession would be negatively correlated with the probability of <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> is not supported by the data. We find that changes in employment status explain roughly one-quarter of the correlation between <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> and unemployment rates. Our estimates imply that 440, 000 men, 436, 000 women, and 494, 000 children have lost <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> during the current recession. ...|$|R

40|$|James Larson for {{excellent}} {{research assistance}} and Mark Duggan and seminar {{participants at the}} ERIU Ann Arbor conference for helpful comments. Trends in <b>Health</b> Insurance <b>Coverage</b> among Low-Skilled Women We analyze the trends in <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> for women {{with less than a}} high school education during the 1990 s and also examine how welfare reform affected their probability of insurance coverage. We compare the experiences of these women with trends for women with a high school and college education. We find that the probability of having health insurance declined for all of these groups during the 1990 s, but the reasons for these declines differ across groups. Women with less than a high school education experienced a large decline in the probability of having health insurance as a result of declines in spousal coverage (due both to declines in marriage and to declines in spousal coverage) and declines in own-employer sponsored coverage for among workers. By contrast, women with a high school degree experienced a smaller decline in <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> during the 1990 s, mostly because declines in spousal coverage were partially offset by increases in own-employer coverage. Women with a college education experienced only very small declines in the probability of <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> in the 1990 s. Against this backdrop of large overall declines in <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage,</b> welfare reform appears to have led to a modest increase in <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> for women with less than a high school degree, primarily by increasing the probability of having private health insurance. This modest increase was not large enough to offset the large secular declines in <b>health</b> insurance <b>coverage</b> among low-skilled wome...|$|R
