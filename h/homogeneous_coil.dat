If time allows, recommendations on how to construct a simple circuit model to explain the phenomenon will be given based on the electrical properties obtained from measurements performed during the work of this thesis. Additional information on pacemaker lead heating during impact of magnet in X-ray (MRI) will be presented if time allows. Significant electrical properties of pacemaker leads are compiled in this thesis.   ANALYSIS OF CIRCUIT MODEL The {{purpose of this}} model is to create an equivalent electronic circuit model that describes a pacemaker lead electrical property. The model is divided into three different sections: proximal part, the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>coil</b> part and the distal end.   The model will include series inductance, parallel capacitance, series resistance, lossless admittance and winding capacitance between each loop for the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>coil</b> part, additionally the impedance of the proximal and distal part will be included...|$|E

Populations of discharging {{tubes of}} Glugea hertwigi spores pulse-labeled with latex particles for 1 - 3 s were consistently devoid of label at the distal ends; discharging tubes were completely labeled after 30 - to 60 -s exposure to latex.

40|$|There {{has been}} a surge of {{interest}} in endoscopic lung volume reduction (ELVR) strategies for advanced COPD. Valve implants, coil implants, biological LVR (BioLVR), bronchial thermal vapour ablation, and airway stents are used to induce lung deflation with {{the ultimate goal of}} improving respiratory mechanics and chronic dyspnea. Patients presenting with severe air trapping (e. g., inspiratory capacity/total lung capacity (TLC) 225 % predicted) and thoracic hyperinflation (TLC > 150 % predicted) have the greatest potential to derive benefit from ELVR procedures. Pre-LVRS or ELVR assessment should ideally include cardiological evaluation, high resolution CT scan, ventilation and perfusion scintigraphy, full pulmonary function tests, and cardiopulmonary exercise testing. ELVR procedures are currently available in selected Canadian research centers as part of ethically approved clinical trials. If a decision is made to offer an ELVR procedure, one-way valves are the first option in the presence of complete lobar exclusion and no significant collateral ventilation. When the fissure is not complete, when collateral ventilation is evident in heterogeneous emphysema or when emphysema is <b>homogeneous,</b> <b>coil</b> implants or BioLVR (in that order) are the next logical alternatives...|$|E

Magnetic material is used to improve field uniformity at the central region and to shield the magnet. The influence of magnetic material is calculated by using a code based on the solution of scalar and vector potentials equations.

40|$|A novel {{configuration}} of a single-core gradiometer, utilizing both homogeneous and gradient feedback operation, is presented. The fluxgate gradiometer comprises {{of a standard}} pick-up/ feedback coil and an additional gradient pickup/feedback coil with two separate electronic blocks. The 40 -mm-long gradient coil is concentric and coaxial with the homogeneous pickup/feedback coil: the gradient coil assembly was slipped over an already existing race-track fluxgate sensor. The gradient coil works as a pick-up coil and it also generates the compensating field which well approximates a first-order gradient field with zero spatial-mean value. Together with the compensating field from the <b>homogeneous</b> feedback <b>coil,</b> it is thus always possible to measure in two independent feedback loops the homogeneous and gradient field components. The 1 /f gradient noise is 4 nT/m/√Hz @ 1 Hz, {{and it can be}} further improved by separating the gradient feedback and compensating coil...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of two-dimensional superconducting quantum interference filters (2 D-SQIFs) {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field B. The dependences of the dc voltage on the applied magnetic field are characterized by a unique delta-like dip at B= 0, which depends on the distribution of the areas of the individual loops, and on the bias current. The voltage span of the dip scales proportional to the number of rows simultaneously operating at the same working point. In addition, the voltage response of the 2 D-SQIF is sensitive to a field gradient generated by a control line and superimposed to the <b>homogeneous</b> field <b>coil.</b> This feature opens the possibility to use 2 D superconducting quantum interference filters as highly sensitive detectors of spatial gradients of magnetic field.

40|$|In {{inductive}} {{wireless power}} transmission system a lateral displacement of the receiver coil to the transmitter coil leads to a change ofthe coupling factor and thus an unwanted variation of the power transfer. Here, an algorithm to determine the turn distribution to achieve <b>homogeneous</b> coupling between <b>coils</b> of different diameter is described. As long as the coils overlap, the variation of the coupling factor is very low. To achieve a lateral displacement over an even larger area, an array of transmitter coils can be used. The size of the receiver coil is selected such that it always covers a complete transmitter coil. If only the covered transmitter coil is activated by a suitable detection circuit, the power transmission area can be arbitrary large with homogeneous magnetic coupling...|$|R

40|$|Seven tesla (T) MR imaging is {{potentially}} promising for the morphologic evaluation of coronary arteries {{because of the}} increased signal-to-noise ratio compared to lower field strengths, in turn allowing improved spatial resolution, improved temporal resolution, or reduced scanning times. However, there are {{a large number of}} technical challenges, including the commercial 7 T systems not being equipped with <b>homogeneous</b> body radiofrequency <b>coils,</b> conservative specific absorption rate constraints, and magnified sample-induced amplitude of radiofrequency field inhomogeneity. In the present study, an initial attempt was made to address these challenges and to implement coronary MR angiography at 7 T. A single-element radiofrequency transmit and receive coil was designed and a 7 T specific imaging protocol was implemented, including significant changes in scout scanning, contrast generation, and navigator geometry compared to current protocols at 3 T. With this methodology, the first human coronary MR images were successfully obtained at 7 T, with both qualitative and quantitative findings being presented...|$|R
40|$|Neuroimaging of macaques at ultra-high field (UHF) {{is usually}} {{conducted}} by combining a volume coil for transmit (Tx) and a phased array coil for receive (Rx) tightly enclosing the monkey's head. Good {{results have been}} achieved using vertical or horizontal magnets with implanted or near-surface coils. An alternative and less costly approach, the travelling-wave (TW) excitation concept, may offer more flexible experimental setups on human whole-body UHF magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) systems, which are now more widely available. Goal {{of the study was}} developing and validating the TW concept for in vivo primate MRI. The TW Primate System (TWPS) uses the radio frequency shield of the gradient system of a human whole-body 7 T MRI system as a waveguide to propagate a circularly polarized B 1 field represented by the TE 11 mode. This mode is excited by a specifically designed 2 -port patch antenna. For receive, a customized neuroimaging monkey head receive-only coil was designed. Field simulation was used for development and evaluation. Signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) was compared with data acquired with a conventional monkey volume head coil consisting of a <b>homogeneous</b> transmit <b>coil</b> and a 12 -element receive coil. The TWPS offered good image homogeneity in the volume-of-interest Turbo spin echo images exhibited a high contrast, allowing a clear depiction of the cerebral anatomy.

40|$|Transcriptase {{activity}} was dissociated from vesicular stomatitis virions by highionic-strength buffer containing Triton X- 100. Considerable enzyme activity could be restored by recombining inactive sedimentable and nonsedimentable virion fractions. Reconstituted transcriptase {{activity was}} dependent {{on the presence of}} all four nucleoside triphosphates and the concentration of heat-labile molecules in both supernatant and pellet fractions. Lower NaCl concentrations removed ∼ 46 % of virion protein, but did not release transcriptase activity from the pellet fraction, nor could incorporation of 3 H-uridine- 5 ′-triphosphate by complete virions be increased by adding soluble transcriptase. Evidence that the virion nucleocapsid is the transcription template was provided by finding that the pellet contained predominantly virion core nucleoprotein, ribonucleic acid, and <b>homogeneous</b> nucleocapsid <b>coils</b> when viewed by electron microscopy. Removal of envelope G and M proteins by Triton and low-salt buffer without decreasing nucleocapsid polymerase activity indicates that neither G nor M protein is necessary for transcription. Additional data are required to determine whether the minor nucleocapsid proteins L or NSl, or both, which are at least partially solubilized in high-salt buffer, are the transcriptase. Preliminary data suggest that the major N nucleoprotein, which was not solubilized by high-salt buffer, is also required for transcription. Defective T virions contained at least as much transcriptase per weight as did B virions, as determined by restoration with T supernatant fluids of transcription function to B nucleocapsid template. However, the T nucleocapsid would not serve as template for B or T transcriptase, a finding which is interpreted as evidence of T template defectiveness. The presence of defective T nucleocapsids did not interfere with B or T transcriptase function reconstituted with B template...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Magnetic {{field is}} usually {{generated}} using magnets realized {{as a set}} of simple coils. In general, those magnets generate magnetic field with nonzero components in all directions. Usually during the design process only one component of the magnetic field is taken into account, and in the optimisation procedure the currents and positions of simple coils are found to minimize the error between the axial component of the magnetic field and the required magnetic field in the ROI. In this work, it is shown that if the high quality homogeneous magnetic field is generated then indeed one may neglect non-axial components. On the other hand, if the obtained magnetic field is not homogeneous either due to design requirements of too restrictive constrains, then all other components may severely deteriorate the quality of the magnetic field. In {{the second part of the}} paper, we show how to design a 3 D transversal coil system to solve problems which are intractable in the 1 D case.

30|$|This work brings {{theoretical}} and experimental arguments justifying the implementation {{and assessment of}} 31 P-ZTE-based attenuation correction on human PET-MRI systems. The 31 P approach should prove more straightforward and robust on a clinical imaging system. The first advantage of a human system will be the suppression of 31 P-ZTE sensitivity in homogeneities. MRI {{of the human brain}} is performed with <b>homogeneous</b> volume RF <b>coils,</b> which are rarely used in rodent for geometrical reasons. Another advantage will be the suppression of the separate calibration experiment on bone sample, which is a major source of inaccuracy. The geometry of human RF coils will make it possible to insert a bone sample of known μ inside the 31 P coil so that 31 P signal can be directly converted into μ 31 P by comparing the signal of the skull with the signal of the sample in the same image. Finally, implementation on a hybrid PET-MRI system will improve the correction accuracy over our experimental setup by suppressing bias associated with registration errors. Implementation on a human hybrid PET-MRI system will make it possible to carefully compare the 31 P-based method with currently available methods.|$|R
40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of interventional MRI, {{radiofrequency}} (RF) heating at the tips of guidewires, catheters, and other wire-shaped devices has become an important safety issue. Previ-ous studies have identified some of the variables that affect the relative magnitude of this heating but none could predict the absolute amount of heating to formulate safety margins. This study presents the first theoretical model of wire tip heating that can accurately predict its absolute value, assuming a straight wire, a <b>homogeneous</b> RF <b>coil,</b> and a wire that does not extend out of the tissue. The local specific absorption rate (SAR) amplification from induced currents on insulated and bare wires was calculated using the method of moments. This SAR gain was combined with a semianalytic solution to the bioheat transfer equation to generate a safety index. The safety index (°C/(W/kg)) {{is a measure of the}} in vivo temperature change that can occur with the wire in place, normalized to the SAR of the pulse sequence. This index can be used to set limits on the spatial peak SAR of pulse sequences that are used with the interventional wire. For the case of a straight resonant wire in a tissue with very low perfusion, only about 100 mW/kg/°C spatial peak SAR may be used at 1. 5 T. But for ≤ 10 -cm wires with an insulation thickness ≥ 30 % of the wire radius that are placed in well-perfused tissues, normal operating conditions of 4 W/kg spatial peak SAR are possible at 1. 5 T. Further model development to include the influence of inhomogeneous RF, curved wires, and wires that extend out of the sample are required to generate safety indices that are applicable to com-mon clinical situations. We propose a simple way to ensure safety when using an interventional wire: set a limit on the SAR of allowable pulse sequences that is a factor of a safety index below the tolerable temperature increase.

40|$|Parallel imaging (PI) {{is widely}} used for imaging {{acceleration}} by means of coil spatial sensitivities associated with phased array coils (PACs). By employing a time-division multiplexing technique, a single-channel rotating radiofrequency coil (RRFC) provides an alternative method to reduce scan time. Strategically combining these two concepts could provide enhanced acceleration and efficiency. In this work, the imaging acceleration ability and homogeneous image reconstruction strategy of 4 -element rotating radiofrequency coil array (RRFCA) was numerically investigated and experimental validated at 7 T with a <b>homogeneous</b> phantom. Each <b>coil</b> of RRFCA was capable of acquiring {{a large number of}} sensitivity profiles, leading to a better acceleration performance illustrated by the improved geometry-maps that have lower maximum values and more uniform distributions compared to 4 - and 8 -element stationary arrays. A reconstruction algorithm, rotating SENSitivity Encoding (rotating SENSE), was proposed to provide image reconstruction. Additionally, by optimally choosing the angular sampling positions and transmit profiles under the rotating scheme, phantom images could be faithfully reconstructed. The results indicate that, the proposed technique is able to provide homogeneous reconstructions with overall higher and more uniform signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) distributions at high reduction factors. It is hoped that, by employing the high imaging acceleration and homogeneous imaging reconstruction ability of RRFCA, the proposed method will facilitate human imaging for ultra high field MRI...|$|R

We investigated the feasibility, safety and efficacy of LVR coil treatment in a prospective multicentre cohort trial in patients with severe emphysema. Patients were treated in 11 centres. Safety was evaluated by recording all adverse events, efficacy by the St George's Respiratory Questionnaire (SGRQ) as primary endpoint, and pulmonary function testing, modified Medical Research Council dyspnoea score (mMRC) and 6 -min walk distance (6 MWD) up to 12 months after the final treatment. Sixty patients (60. 9 ± 7. 5 years, forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV 1) 30. 2 ± 6. 3 % pred) were bronchoscopically treated with coils (55 bilateral, 5 unilateral), with a median of 10 (range 5 - 15) coils per lobe. Within 30 days post-treatment, seven {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} exacerbations (6. 1 %), six pneumonias (5. 2 %), four pneumothoraces (3. 5 %) and one haemoptysis (0. 9 %) occurred as serious adverse events. At 6 and 12 months, respectively, ΔSGRQ was - 12. 1 ± 12. 9 and - 11. 1 ± 13. 3 points, Δ 6 MWD was + 29. 7 ± 74. 1 m and + 51. 4 ± 76 m, ΔFEV 1 was + 0. 11 ± 0. 20 L and + 0. 11 ± 0. 30 L, and ΔRV (residual volume) was - 0. 65 ± 0. 90 L and - 0. 71 ± 0. 81 L (all p< 0. 01).
