50|$|On older Intel based PCs, the northbridge {{was also}} named {{external}} memory controller hub (MCH) or <b>graphics</b> and memory <b>controller</b> hub (GMCH) if equipped with integrated graphics. Increasingly these functions became {{integrated into the}} CPU chip itself, beginning with memory and <b>graphics</b> <b>controllers.</b> For Intel Sandy Bridge and AMD Accelerated Processing Unit processors introduced in 2011, all of {{the functions of the}} northbridge reside on the CPU, while AMD FX CPUs still require external northbridge and southbridge chips.|$|R
5000|$|GPU {{switching}} is {{a mechanism}} used on computers with multiple <b>graphic</b> <b>controllers.</b> This mechanism allows {{the user to}} either maximize the graphic performance or prolong battery life by switching between the graphic cards.
