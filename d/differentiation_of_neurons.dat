50|$|Ulegyria {{was found}} in about 1/3 of {{patients}} with defects caused by circulatory disease in the perinatal period. Most clinical observations of the condition report mental retardation, cerebral palsy, and seizures as the main defects. However, milder cases {{have been reported in}} which patients that exhibit ulegyria develop relatively normally. The main movement disorders associated with ulegyria that are classified as cerebral palsy are choreoathetosis, dystonia, and ataxia. It is suspected that ulegyria leads to epilepsy because malformation of the cortex obstructs the <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> <b>neurons,</b> glial cells, and synapses. Parietal-occipital lobe epilepsy, which is often synonymous with posterior cortex epilepsy (PCE), is the form of the disease seen in most cases involving ulegyria. This type of epilepsy is very rare, making up about 5% of all reports of epilepsy. This form of the disease involves symptoms that would be expected from damage to the parietal and occipital lobes: seizures with visual hallucinations, visuospatial dysfunction, tingling, numbness, pain, and a burning sensation. In addition to ulegyria, tumors and cortical dysplasia constitute the major causes of PCE. Most of the epilepsy seen in conjunction with ulegyria is classified as medically refractory, meaning it is not responsive to treatment. Patients usually present symptoms of epilepsy at an early age. The severity of epilepsy has been shown to depend on this age of onset as well as the quantity of cortical lesions; earlier onset of epilepsy and a larger extent of lesions tends to mean more severe seizures.|$|E

40|$|The bone {{morphogenetic}} protein (BMP) {{family is}} a class of transforming growth factor (TGF-β) superfamily molecules that have been implicated in neuronal differentiation. We studied the effects of BMP 2 and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) on inducing <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> enteric <b>neurons</b> and the signal transduction pathways involved. Studies were performed using a novel murine fetal enteric neuronal cell line (IM-FEN) and primary enteric neurons.

BMP 2 increased the <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> enteric <b>neurons</b> compared with vehicle and GDNF-treated neurons (P < 0. 001). BMP 2 increased the expression of the mature neuronal markers (P < 0. 05).

40|$|The proneural protein neurogenin (XNGNR 1) drives <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>neurons</b> in {{combination}} with the cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) inhibitor Xic 1. Differentiation is inhibited by Notch signalling, resulting in a scattered neuronal distribution. Here we show that Notch signalling regulates the level of Xic 1 transcription, yet this does not correlate with Notch's ability to perturb the cell cycle. Instead, Notch may regulate Xic 1 levels to control its differentiation function directly, which is required in parallel with XNGNR 1 to promote primary neurogenesis. Indeed, Notch-mediated repression of both XNGNR 1 and Xic 1 must be relieved for neuronal differentiation to occur. Interestingly, although Xic 1 is required for XNGNR 1 -mediated neurogenesis, it is not required for XNGNR 1 -mediated upregulation of Delta, allowing establishment of the negative feedback loop involved in lateral inhibition. Therefore, Notch targets Cdk inhibitor expression to regulate <b>differentiation</b> <b>of</b> primary <b>neurons,</b> and its effects on the cell cycle may be of secondary importance...|$|R
