25|$|A {{buddy line}} is a line or strap {{physically}} tethering two scuba divers together underwater to avoid separation in low visibility conditions. A buddy line is usually a short length of about 2 meters with a <b>floating</b> <b>element</b> between the divers {{to reduce the risk}} of snagging on the bottom. A buddy {{line is a}} means of communication and does not need to be very strong or secure, but should not pull off under moderate loads while in use. The divers may communicate by rope signals, but will more usually just use the line to attract attention before moving closer and communicating by hand signals. The disadvantage of a buddy line is an increased risk of snagging and entanglement. The divers may need to disconnect the line quickly at either end in an emergency which may be done by using a quick release mechanism or by cutting the line, both of which require at least one hand to be free. A velcro strap requires no tools for release and can be released under tension.|$|E

40|$|The Norwegian Public Roads Administration is {{currently}} both planning {{and building a}} new coastal highway, along the fjord-dense Norwegian west coast. In that concern, dynamic response of floating structures exposed to wave loads is of high importance. This kind of problem can be solved in the frequency or the time domain. In time domain analyses, the stochastic load must be estimated using Monte Carlo simulations, and long time series run to find confident results for the stochastic response. For linear problems, calculations in the frequency domain are therefore often favourable. The accuracy of the well-established linear frequency domain methods was studied, for stochastic problems, in this thesis. In particular, the Bers&# 248;ysund Bridge was considered. A program was developed in Matlab for calculations of structures on <b>floating</b> <b>elements,</b> where DNV HydroD Wadam analyses of the <b>floating</b> <b>elements</b> and an Abaqus/CAE model of {{the frame of the}} structure are prerequisites. Using state space form and iteration, the complex and non-linear modal eigenvalue problem of the system was also solved. The findings of this thesis involve that the results agree well with similar analyses performed in the time domain. 20 modes resulted in near-converged results for the model of the Bergs&# 248;ysund Bridge exposed to white noise loading. When estimated sea load was enforced, approximately 30 included modes were needed for convergence.

The sensor was first calibrated in the lab by applying shear forces and it showed high sensitivity to shear stress (= 91. 3 +/- 2. 1 pC/Pa) due to the high piezoelectric coefficients of PMN- 33 %PT (d 31 =- 1330 pC/N). The sensor also showed almost no sensitivity to normal stress (less than 1. 2 pC/Pa) because of the electromechanical symmetry of the device. The usable frequency range of the sensor is 0 - 800 Hz.

40|$|The {{first part}} of this report {{describes}} the design and construction of a <b>floating</b> <b>element</b> skin friction balance. This instrument, which is essentially an improved version of Dhawan's balance, was applied to measurements of local skin friction in the turbulent boundary layer of a smooth flat plate at high subsonic Mach numbers and supersonic Mach numbers up to M = 1. 75. The measured skin friction coefficients are consistent with the results of other investigations at subsonic and also at high supersonic speeds. The principal difficulties which exist in comparing skin friction coefficients at various Mach numbers are discussed. The second part of this report describes the application of the Stanton tube technique to skin friction measurements near the base of a shock wave impinging upon a turbulent boundary layer. The <b>floating</b> <b>element</b> technique is inherently difficult to apply for skin friction measurements in non-uniform flow. Hence, a Stanton tube is calibrated by means of a <b>floating</b> <b>element</b> balance in a uniform flow field and then used to measure skin friction near the base of an impinging shock. Oblique shock waves were produced by two wedges of 2. 5 [degree] and 4. 6 [degree] semi-angles and a normal shock was generated by a choked channel. Skin friction and velocity profiles were obtained for these three cases at a free stream Mach number of 1. 48...|$|E

Cross-correlations of shear stress and streamwise velocity fluctuations were analysed in an attempt to identify structure angles in the flow.
