The real issues are not being addressed and it’s time that we put forward an alternative vision, a bold thinking. We might not win, but we can certainly influence the debate.|$|E

500|$|After the 2001 NPC, Crusaders' captain Todd Blackadder left New Zealand to play rugby in Scotland. During the 2002 Super 12 pre-season, half-back Justin Marshall {{questioned}} {{which of}} the senior players were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> into Blackadder's leadership role for the tough matches. Hammett took the comment [...] "as {{a slap in the}} face", as [...] "one player doesn't make a team." [...] Hammett later said [...] "I took it that way, and I {{think a lot of the}} others must have as well, because we all ended up stepping up!" [...] Subsequently, the Crusaders went through the season unbeaten, including a 96–19 victory over the New South Wales Waratahs. He again played for the All Blacks in 2002, starting against Australia and South Africa in the Tri-Nations. The 2002 NPC season was Hammett's last, and although Canterbury were knocked out in their semi-final, they managed to retain the Ranfurly Shield. Hammett's last match was his 76th for Canterbury.|$|E

Maruri was resigning one year before the scheduled completion of his term. After Maruri resigned, Juan Carlos Estrada was designated as the new President of Barcelona. Estrada also resigned the next day and Alfonso Harb Viteri assumed the presidency. Harb stated that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> down as President and announced that Barcelona's presidential elections would be held on June 11 of the following year.|$|E
2500|$|Carter, Hancock and Williams {{would go}} on {{to become one of the}} quintessential rhythm {{sections}} of the decade, both together on their own albums and as the backbone of Miles Davis's second great quintet. [...] This aspect of the second great quintet is an ironic footnote for Davis, who was not fond of Dolphy's music: in a 1964 Down Beat [...] "Blindfold Test", Miles famously quipped, [...] "The next time I see [...] I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> on his foot." [...] However, Davis absorbed a rhythm section who had all worked under Dolphy, thus creating a band whose brand of [...] "out" [...] was very similar to Dolphy's.|$|E
2500|$|On December 23, Go Daddy withdrew {{its support}} for SOPA, {{releasing}} a statement saying [...] "Go Daddy will support it when and if the Internet community supports it." [...] CEO Warren Adelman stated when asked, that he couldn't commit to changing Go Daddy's position on the record in Congress, but said [...] "I'll take that back to our legislative guys, but I agree that's an important step"; when pressed, he said [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> back and let others take leadership roles." [...] Further outrage {{was due to the}} fact that many Internet sites would be subject to shutdowns under SOPA, but GoDaddy is in a narrow class of exempted businesses that would have immunity, whereas many other domain operators would not.|$|E

2500|$|On June 5, 2007, Libby {{was sentenced}} to 30 months in prison, a fine of US$250,000, and two years of {{probation}} (supervised release) after the expiration of his prison term. According to The Washington Post, Judge Walton expressed his belief that the trial did not prove Libby knew that Plame worked in an undercover capacity when he disclosed her identity to several reporters. He added, however, that [...] "anybody at that high-level position had a unique and special obligation before they said anything about anything associated with a national security agency ... make every conceivable effort" [...] to verify their status before releasing information about them. Walton stated [...] "While {{there is no evidence}} that Mr. Libby knew what the situation was, he surely did not take any efforts to find out,...I think public officials need to know if they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>step</b> over the line, there are going to be consequences.... causes people to think our government does not work for them." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{notion of}} Alberta secession from Canada has gained sympathy from some figures within Alberta's {{conservative}} parties.

5000|$|J-31 {{was still}} skinny at age three, and his breed was usually subject to turning fat and clumsy as it matured. Thus, Sumner just held to {{branding}} him with J-31 and not {{giving him a}} name. Sumner didn't have high hopes that the bull would survive long enough to merit a name. Sumner brought the bull to some local rodeos in northern Oklahoma. However, J-31 didn't do {{much in the way}} of bucking. It appears J-31 was not a good bucking prospect. The yellow bull could jump high, but could not not figure out what to do with the cowboy on his back. The first three cowboys easily made the whistle on him.
