40|$|Most supertree {{algorithms}} combine {{collections of}} rooted phylogenetic trees with overlapping leaf sets {{into a single}} rooted phylogenetic tree (for example, see Aho et al., 1981; Page, 2002; Semple and Steel, 2000). It is implicit {{in all of these}} algorithms is that, as a whole, the leaves of the rooted phylogenetic trees in the input collection represent non-nested taxa. Thus, for example, the ‘domestic dog’ and ‘mammal ’ cannot be represented by two distinct leaves in such a collection as the former is nested inside the latter. In practice, however, one often wants to combine rooted trees in which taxa are nested. In other words, combine rooted trees in which the leaves {{as well as some of}} the interior vertices are labelled. These interior labels represent taxa at a level higher than that of their descendants. For example, families versus genera, or genera versus species. Moreover, it may happen that a leaf of one of the input trees represents a taxa that is represented by an <b>interior</b> <b>label</b> of another tree. In this chapter, we describe two supertree algorithms for combining rooted trees in which the leaves as well as some of the interior vertices are labelled. Called ‘rooted semi-labelled trees’, these trees are more general than rooted phylogenetic trees in that not only are their leaves labelled, but some of their interior vertices may also be labelled. Both algorithms are polynomial time in the size of the input and are motivated by a problem posed by Page in an earlier chapter called ‘Taxonomy, Supertrees, and the Tree of Life’...|$|E

40|$|Most supertree {{algorithms}} combine {{collections of}} rooted phylogenetic trees with overlapping leaf sets {{into a single}} rooted phylogenetic tree (for example, see [1, 4, 6, 7]). Implicit {{in all of these}} algorithms is that the leaves of all the input trees represent species of the same taxonomic rank.

The result of such an amalgamation may mean that, in addition to all of the leafs being labelled, some of the interior vertices are also labelled. In this chapter, we describe a supertree algorithm for 'rooted semi-labelled trees'. A rooted semi-labelled tree is more general than a rooted phylogenetic tree in that not only are its leaves labelled, but some of its interior vertices may also be labelled.

Specifically, in addition to traditional viewing operations, we present new text extrusion techniques combined with techniques that create an interactive explosion diagram. In our approach, scrollable text annotations {{that are associated with}} the various parts of the model can be revealed dynamically, either in part or in full, by moving the mouse cursor within annotation trigger areas. Strong visual connections between model parts and the associated text are included in order to aid comprehension. Furthermore, the model parts can be separated, creating interactive explosion diagrams. Using a 3 D probe, occluding objects can be interactively moved apart and then returned to their initial locations. Displayed annotations are kept readable despite model manipulations. Hence, our techniques provide textual context within the spatial context of the 3 D model...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTypically, supertree methods {{combine a}} {{collection}} of source trees in which just the leaves are labelled by taxa. In such methods the resulting supertree is also leaf-labelled. An underlying assumption in these methods is that, across all trees in the collection, no two of the taxa are nested; for example, "buttercups'' and "plants'' are nested taxa. Motivated by Page, the first supertree algorithm for allowing the source trees to collectively have nested taxa is called AncestralBuild. Here, in addition to taxa labelling the leaves, the source trees may have taxa labelling some of their <b>interior</b> nodes. Taxa <b>labelling</b> <b>interior</b> nodes are at a higher taxonomic level than that of their descendants (for example, genera versus species). Analogous to the supertree method Build for deciding the compatibility of {{a collection of}} source trees in which just the leaves are labelled, AncestralBuild is a polynomial-time algorithm for deciding the compatibility {{of a collection of}} source trees in which some of the interior nodes are also labelled by taxa. Although a more general method, in this paper we show that the original description of AncestralBuild can be modified so that the running time is as fast as the current fastest running time for Build. Fast computation for deciding compatibility is essential if one is to make use of phylogenetic databases that contain thousands of trees on tens of thousands of taxa. This is particularly so as AncestorBuild is incorporated as a basic tool inside more general supertree methods. We apply the method to propose a comprehensive phylogeny of the strepsirrhines, a major group of the primates...|$|R

40|$|Alpha-Beta is {{the most}} common game tree search algorithm, due to its {{high-performance}} and straightforward implementation. In practice one must find the best trade-off between heuristic evaluation time and bringing the subset of nodes explored closer to a minimum proof graph. In this paper we present a series of structural properties of minimum proof graphs that help us to prove that finding such graphs is NP-hard for arbitrary DAG inputs, but can be done in linear time for trees. We then introduce the class of fastest-cut-first search heuristics that aim to approximate minimum proof graphs by sorting moves based on approximations of sub-DAG values and sizes. To explore how various aspects of the game tree (such as branching factor and distribution of move values) affect the performance of Alpha-Beta we introduce the class of “Prefix Value Game Trees ” that allows us to <b>label</b> <b>interior</b> nodes with true minimax values on the fly without search. Using these trees we show that by explicitly attempting to approximate a minimum game tree we are able to achieve performance gains over Alpha-Beta with common extensions. ...|$|R

This bound is best possible. A linear time algorithm for constructing nearly optimal trees is described.

Alternatively, the movements across the plasma membrane of ΔpH-indicating atebrin or 9 -aminoacridine, and of ΔΨ-indicating 8 -anilino-l-naphthalenesulfonate were qualitatively followed by fluorescence measurements. Attempts were made to discriminate between the individual chemiosmotic gradients across the cytoplasmic (plasmalemma) and the intracytoplasmic (thylakoid) membranes. By use of the ionophores nigericin, monensin, and valinomycin, {{the components of the}} proton motive force, namely the proton concentration gradient ΔpH and the electric membrane potential ΔΨ were shown to be mutually exchangeable within the range of external pH values tested (3. 2 - 11. 0). Both components were depressed by the uncoupler carbonylcyanide m-chlorophenylhydrazone, though inhibition of ΔpH was much more pronounced than that of ΔΨ, notably in the alkaline pH 0 range. The total proton electrochemical gradient across the plasma membrane was significantly higher in aerobic than in anaerobic cells and increased markedly (i. e. became more negative) towards lower pH 0 values. This increase was paralleled by a similar increase in the rate of endogenous respiration of the cells. At the same time the ATPase inhibitor dicyclohexylcarbodiimide only slightly affected the proton motive force across the plasma membrane of aerobic cells.

40|$|Three-way dissimilarities are a {{generalization}} of (two-way) dissimilarities {{which can be}} used to indicate the lack of homogeneity or resemblance between any three objects. Such maps have applications in cluster analysis, and have been used in areas such as psychology and phylogenetics, where three-way data tables can arise. Special examples of such dissimilarities are three-way tree-metrics and ultrametrics, which arise from leaf-labelled trees with edges labelled by positive real numbers. Here we consider three-way maps which arise from leaf-labelled trees where instead the <b>interior</b> vertices are <b>labelled</b> by an arbitrary set of values. For unrooted trees we call such maps three-way symbolic tree-maps; for rooted trees we call them three-way symbolic ultrametrics since they can be considered as a {{generalization of}} the (two-way) symbolic ultrametrics of Böcker and Dress. We show that, as with two- and three-way tree-metrics and ultrametrics, three-way symbolic tree-maps and ultrametrics can be characterized via certain k-point conditions. In the unrooted case, our characterization is mathematically equivalent to one presented by Gurvich for a certain class of edge-labelled hypergraphs. We also show that it can be decided whether or not an arbitrary three-way symbolic map is a tree-map or a symbolic ultrametric using a triplet-based approach that relies on the so-called BUILD algorithm for deciding when a set of 3 -leaved trees or triplets can be displayed by a single tree. We envisage that our results will be useful in developing new approaches and algorithms for understanding 3 -way data, especially within the area of phylogenetics...|$|R
