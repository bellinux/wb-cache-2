5|$|Scientific {{interpretations of}} the crest's {{function}} began in 1910, when George Francis Eaton proposed two possibilities: an aerodynamic counterbalance and a muscle attachment point. He suggested that the crest might have anchored large, long jaw muscles, but admitted that this function alone could not explain the large size of some crests. Bennett (1992) agreed with Eaton's own assessment that the crest was too large and variable {{to have been a}} muscle attachment site. Eaton had suggested that a secondary function of the crest might have been as a counterbalance against the long beak, reducing the need for heavy neck muscles to control the orientation of the <b>head.</b> <b>Wind</b> tunnel tests showed that the crest did function as an effective counterbalance to a degree, but Bennett noted that again, the hypothesis focuses only on the long crests of male P. longiceps, not on the larger crests of P. sternbergi and very small crests that existed among the females. Bennett found that the crests of females had no counterbalancing effect, and that the crests of male P. sternbergi would, by themselves, {{have a negative effect on}} the balance of the head. In fact, side to side movement of the crests would have required more, not less, neck musculature to control balance.|$|E

25|$|On 18 December 1924, {{not long}} after the C.12a's first flight with the Anzani engine in October, the Belgian pilot Raparlier flew it from Waalhaven, Rotterdam to Le Bourget, Paris via Brussels. The whole flight took just under six hours, despite a one-hour stop in Brussels and a <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> on the second leg, slowing him down and forcing him to land near Le Bourget for extra fuel. The flight drew much attention; after a large number of {{demonstration}} flights in Paris Raparlier returned the C.12a to Waalhaven on 22 February 1924, again getting press attention.|$|E
25|$|As the radial {{point of}} so many ridges Scoat Fell forms the head of several valleys, the major ones being the Wasdale feeders of Mosedale and Nether Beck. Mosedale begins on the eastern flanks of Scoat Fell, between Red Pike and Pillar, {{in the hollow of}} Black Comb. There are crags in the headwall, {{particularly}} to the south. Nether Beck has its birth at Scoat Tarn, a large pool to the south of the fell. This corrie tarn, held in place by grassy moraines is around 65ft deep. Between Steeple and Pillar to the north is Windgap Cove with Black Crag, a Hewitt at its <b>head.</b> <b>Wind</b> Gap is the col between Black Crag and Pillar, while the small Mirk Cove lies between Black Crag and the summit. Finally Mirklin Cove is the corrie between Steeple and Tewit How, drained into Ennerdale by Low Beck. All of the northern coves are home to impressive crags.|$|E

Some 30 Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) flew close escort. The bombers were travelling slowly, forcing the fighters to lower their flaps to stay with the bombers, which made them sitting ducks. They crossed the coast at Folkestone at 11:36. Fighters from II.Lehrgeschwader 2 (Demonstration Wing 2) were also to form part of the escort. They flew in advance of the main force to drop [...] bombs and then resume their role as fighters. The strong <b>head</b> <b>wind</b> slowed the Dorniers, which meant that the Germans took even longer to reach the target while burning up the Bf 109s' limited fuel supplies.

[...] Along Dukes Meadow Cambridge started to tire and Oxford began to gain; passing through the arches of Barnes Bridge, the Light Blues held a four-second lead. [...] Increasing their rate to 34 strokes per minute, Oxford's stroke Mawer tried to pull them back into contention yet just as the boats began to overlap, Cambridge pushed on again to win by one-and-a-quarter lengths in a time of 18 minutes 36 seconds. [...] It was the fastest winning time since the 1934 race and the fourth fastest time in the history of the Boat Race, [...] yet the narrowest winning margin since the 1952 race.

2500|$|Another partial {{solution}} was the Steam Auxiliary Ship - a vessel with a steam engine, but also rigged as a sailing vessel.

These ships struggled to be successful on the route to China, as the standing rigging required when sailing was a handicap when steaming into a <b>head</b> <b>wind,</b> most notably against the southwest monsoon when returning with a cargo of new tea.
