5|$|NIF's laser uses {{a system}} of large flashtubes (like those in a {{photography}} <b>flashlamp)</b> to optically pump {{a large number of}} glass plates. Once the plates are flashed and have settled into a population inversion, a small signal from a separate laser is fed into the optical lines, stimulating the emission in the plates. The plates then dump their stored energy into the growing beam, amplifying it billions of times.|$|E

5000|$|Dye lasers {{sometimes}} use [...] "axial pumping," [...] {{which consists}} of a hollow, annular shaped <b>flashlamp,</b> with the outer envelope mirrored to reflect suitable light back to the center. The dye cell {{is placed in the}} middle, providing a more even distribution of pumping light, and more efficient transfer of energy. The hollow <b>flashlamp</b> also has lower inductance than a normal <b>flashlamp,</b> which provides a shorter flash discharge. Rarely, a [...] "coaxial" [...] design is used for dye lasers, {{which consists of}} a normal <b>flashlamp</b> surrounded by an annular shaped dye cell. This provides better transfer efficiency, eliminating the need for a reflector, but diffraction losses cause a lower gain.|$|E

50|$|Flashlamps {{were the}} {{earliest}} energy source for lasers. They {{are used for}} high pulsed energies in both solid-state and dye lasers. They produce {{a broad spectrum of}} light, causing most of the energy to be wasted as heat in the gain medium. Flashlamps also tend to have a short lifetime. The first laser consisted of a helical <b>flashlamp</b> surrounding a ruby rod.|$|E
50|$|Laser lancets, e.g. Lasette or LaserDoc, {{are used}} as a less painful {{alternative}} for drawing small amounts (up to 100 µl) of capillary blood, e.g. for diabetic glucose tests. An adjustable-power <b>flashlamp</b> or diode pumped pulsed Er:YAG laser is typically used. A 150 mJ pulse (focused to 6 J/mm2) can vaporize a 0.025 mm2 of skin to 0.5 mm depth.|$|E

50|$|Quartz <b>flashlamps</b> are {{the most}} common type used in lasers, and, at low {{energies}} or high repetition rates, can operate at temperatures as high as 900 °C. Higher average powers or repetition rates require water cooling. The water usually has to wash across not only the arc length of the lamp, but across the electrode portion of the glass as well. Water-cooled <b>flashlamps</b> are usually manufactured with the glass shrunken around the electrode to allow direct cooling of the tungsten. If the electrode is allowed to heat much more than the glass thermal expansion can crack the seal.|$|R
50|$|Intense Pulsed Light (IPL) uses <b>flashlamps</b> {{to produce}} high {{intensity}} light over broad visible and infrared wavelengths with filters that select the desired range. IPL {{is used to}} treat dyschromia, rosacea, melasma, acne, photodamage, vascular and pigmented lesions, and rhytides.|$|R
50|$|The laser flash {{method was}} {{developed}} by Parker et al. in 1961.In a vertical setup a light source (e.g. laser, <b>flashlamp)</b> heats the sample from the bottom side and a detector on top detects the time-dependent temperature rise. For measuring the thermal diffusivity, which is strongly temperature-dependent, at different temperatures the sample can {{be placed in a}} furnace at constant temperature.|$|E

50|$|A flashtube, {{also called}} a <b>flashlamp,</b> is an {{electric}} arc lamp designed to produce extremely intense, incoherent, full-spectrum white light for very short durations. Flashtubes {{are made of}} a length of glass tubing with electrodes at either end and are filled with a gas that, when triggered, ionizes and conducts a high voltage pulse to produce the light. Flashtubes are used mostly for photographic purposes but are also employed in scientific, medical, industrial, and entertainment applications.|$|E
5000|$|Intense {{pulsed light}} {{is the use}} of intense pulses of non-coherent light over a range of {{wavelengths}} from 500 nm to 1200 nm. [...] Xenon <b>flashlamps</b> produce high output bursts of broad spectrum. Cooling is used to protect the skin in contact with the device.|$|R
25|$|Nd:YAG absorbs {{mostly in}} the bands between 730–760nm and 790–820nm. At low current densities krypton <b>flashlamps</b> have higher output in those bands than do the more common xenon lamps, which produce more light at around 900nm. The former are {{therefore}} more efficient for pumping Nd:YAG lasers.|$|R

50|$|Arc lamp pumping {{takes place}} in a cavity similar to a <b>flashlamp</b> pumped laser, with a rod and one or more lamps in a {{reflector}} cavity. The exact shape of the cavity is often dependent on how many lamps are used. The main difference is in the cooling. Arc lamps need to be cooled with water, ensuring that the water washes beyond the glass, and across the electrode connectors as well. This requires the use of deionized water with a resistivity of at least 200 kilohms, to keep from shorting out the circuit and corroding the electrodes through electrolysis. Water is typically channeled through a flow tube at a rate of 4 to 10 liters per minute. Arc lamps come in nearly all of the noble gas types, including xenon, krypton, argon, neon, and helium, which all emit spectral lines that are very specific to the gas. The output spectrum of an arc lamp is mostly dependent on the gas type, being narrow band spectral lines very similar to a <b>flashlamp</b> operated at low current densities. The output is highest in the near infrared, and are usually used to pump infrared lasers such as Nd:YAG.|$|E
5000|$|A laser pumped with an {{arc lamp}} or a <b>flashlamp</b> is usually pumped through the lateral {{wall of the}} lasing medium, which is often {{in the form of}} a crystal rod {{containing}} a metallic impurity or a glass tube containing a liquid dye, in a condition known as [...] "side-pumping." [...] To use the lamp's energy most efficiently, the lamps and lasing medium are contained in a reflective cavity that will redirect most of the lamp's energy into the rod or dye cell.|$|E
50|$|Liquid dyes {{have very}} high gain as laser media. The beam {{needs to make}} only a few passes through the liquid to reach full design power, and hence, the high {{transmittance}} of the output coupler. The high gain also leads to high losses, because reflections from the dye-cell walls or <b>flashlamp</b> reflector cause parasitic oscillations, dramatically {{reducing the amount of}} energy available to the beam. Pump cavities are often coated, anodized, or otherwise made of a material that will not reflect at the lasing wavelength while reflecting at the pump wavelength.|$|E
50|$|In gas {{discharge}} lamps, such as <b>flashlamps,</b> current density {{plays an important}} role in the output spectrum produced. Low current densities produce spectral line emission and tend to favour longer wavelengths. High current densities produce continuum emission and tend to favour shorter wavelengths. Low current densities for flash lamps are generally around 10 A∙mm−2. High current densities can be more than 40 A∙mm−2.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design and}} performance of flashlamp-pumped, Nd:glass. Brewster-angle slab amplifiers intended to be deployed in the National Ignition Facility (NIF). To verify performance, we tested a full-size, three-slab-long, NIF prototype amplifier, which {{we believe to be}} the largest flashlamp-pumped Nd:glass amplifier ever assembled. Like the NIF amplifier design, this prototype amplifier had eight 40 -cm-square apertures combined in a four-aperture-high by two-aperture-wide matrix. Specially-shaped reflectors, anti-reflective coatings on the blastshields, and preionized <b>flashlamps</b> were used to increase storage efficiency. Cooling gas was flowed over the <b>flashlamps</b> to remove waste pump heat and to accelerate thermal wavefront recovery. The prototype gain results are consistent with model predictions and provide high confidence in the final engineering design of the NIF amplifiers.
