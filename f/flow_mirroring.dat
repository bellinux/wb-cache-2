40|$|In systems accreting {{well below}} the Eddington rate, the plasma in the {{innermost}} regions of the disk is collisionless and two-temperature, with the ions hotter than the electrons. Yet, whether a collisionless faster-than-Coulomb energy transfer mechanism exists in two-temperature accretion flows is still an open question. We study the physics of electron heating during the growth of ion velocity-space instabilities, by means of multi-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) simulations. A large-scale compression - embedded in a novel form of the PIC equations - continuously amplifies the field. This constantly drives a pressure anisotropy P_perp > P_parallel, due to the adiabatic invariance of the particle magnetic moments. We find that, for ion plasma beta values beta_i ~ 5 - 30 appropriate for the midplane of low-luminosity accretion <b>flows,</b> <b>mirror</b> modes dominate if the electron-to-proton temperature ratio is > 0. 2, whereas if it is m_e/m_i - governed by the conservation of the magnetic moment in the growing fields of the instability - {{is proportional to the}} initial electron temperature.

In the absence of policy consensus or evidence on optimal payment models, rural communities adopt a diversity of approaches to revenue collection.

The analysis draws on a unique data set comprising financial records spanning 27 years and 100 communities, operational performance indicators for 200 waterpoints, and water source choices for more than 2000 households. Results suggest communities collecting pay-as-you-fetch fees on a volumetric basis generate higher levels of revenue and experience better operational performance than communities charging flat fees.

Yield, trunk cross-sectional area, fruit quality, and leaf and fruit mineral concentrations were measured {{throughout the study}} on adjacent trees at each location. Granier sap flow probes were installed on 10 nearby ‘Sweetheart’ trees to monitor seasonal tree water use. Within-season average volume change of individual cherries showed similar annual patterns at all locations with a decreased growth rate immediately prior to harvest, especially in 2006, the warmest year, when the smallest cherries were harvested. Yield, TCSA and percent splits, with coefficients of variation frequently exceeding 50 %, had highest within block variability. Yield was affected more by spring frost in 2007 than any nutritional consideration. TCSA was lower at warm locations which consistently accumulated higher growing degree days (5 C) by harvest. Smaller trees had lower but apparently adequate leaf and soil K levels. Fruit splits and leaf K concentrations were positively correlated annually. Sap <b>flow</b> <b>mirrored</b> changes in atmometer-measured evapotranspiration, except during the periods of highest evaporative demand near to harvest when inadequate irrigation and water stressed trees occurred.

The re-classification of these data into a broadly comparable BOPS-based classification scheme yields 15 individual service sectors (and 16 sectors for FDI data). The data sources include the OECD, the IMF, Eurostat, and UNCTAD. The time span ranges broadly from 1994 - 2006, with earlier data available for individual countries.

Nitric oxide (NO) production increases {{in proportion to}} the magnitude of flow and is known to be athero-protective. What is not known, however, is the effect of flow reversal on NO concentration ([NO]). The hypothesis of the present study is that [NO] is reduced in reverse flow. An additional hypothesis is that the reduction in [NO] is mediated through an increase in superoxide production during flow reversal. These hypotheses were tested in an ex vivo preparation of porcine elastic and muscular arteries. The flow of a physiological solution through the vessels was regulated in the forward and reverse direction and the effluent was assayed for nitrite levels using a combination of a diazo coupling method and high performance liquid chromatography. Our results show that [NO] is significantly reduced during reverse flow.

A T-junction was used as inlet, while mixture velocities varied from 0. 0028 m/s to 0. 0674 m/s. Two main circulation vortices were found within the plugs while at intermediate mixture velocities two additional secondary vortices appeared at the plug front.
