5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) has a {{date with}} Steven Black (Wayne Brady), Tracy Jordan's (Tracy Morgan) new {{business}} manager, whom she met in one of Tracy's after-parties. Many people around Liz make an issue of Steven being black, but Liz does not care about his race. On her date with Steven, Liz is surprised to find out certain things about him, and {{does not have a}} good time. Steven believes that Liz doesn't like him because he is black, when really she does not like him as a person. She {{does not want to be}} thought of as racist, so she continues on the date. Later, Liz tries to break up with Steven and explain to him that she <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not like him as a person, not because of his race. To prove they are incompatible, she brings him as a guest to the Source Awards the following night.|$|E
25|$|Within {{days of his}} {{confession}} in open court, Heirens denied any responsibility for the murders. Mary Jane Blanchard, daughter of murder victim Josephine Ross, {{was one of the}} first dissenters, being quoted in 1946 as saying:I cannot believe that young Heirens murdered my mother. He <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not fit into the picture of my mother's death... I have looked at all the things Heirens stole and there was nothing of my mother's things among them.|$|E

I mean, {{all of those}} natural consequences which are much more severe than {{a day or two}} or three in jail have not stopped them from using drugs and alcohol. Why would we think putting them in jail would do so?".|$|E

[...] In itself such a material is senseless, valueless, purposeless. [...] It <b>just</b> <b>does</b> what it does do, following a fixed routine imposed by external relations which do not spring from {{the nature of its}} being. [...] It is this assumption that I call 'scientific materialism.' [...] Also it is an assumption which I shall challenge as being entirely unsuited to the scientific situation at which we have now arrived." ...|$|E

As Locke goes to the beach to get shovels, Sayid follows him and asks what really killed Eko. Locke says that the {{survivors}} call it [...] "The Monster", and further speculates that The Monster may be what brought them there and that Eko died for a reason, he <b>just</b> <b>does</b> {{not know what it}} is yet. After the burial, Locke sees a message on Eko's stick: [...] "Lift up your eyes and look north, John 3:05".|$|E
500|$|Vernon was sampled {{on another}} {{song from the}} album, [...] "Lost in the World" [...] and appears on vocals on [...] "Monster". While there during {{recording}} sessions, he had reportedly recorded 10 tracks. He watched Minaj record her verse, and he too, expressed admiration for Minaj's performance on the song, however he noted that initially {{he had no idea}} who she was. Vernon described the process as highly artistic, stating that the fourteen-hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity. West, talking about recording the song with Vernon, stated that he was [...] "similar to me, where he <b>just</b> <b>does</b> shit just so people would be like, 'Oh shit, how did you do that? How did that happen?' He's just a really cool guy to be around." ...|$|E

500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Ann Powers praised its music's [...] "depth and complexity", {{adding that}} it [...] "highlights his focused {{language}} skills within musical settings that touch upon rock, electro, dubstep and classical fanfare, grounded in a thick bottom that guarantees plenty of booty bounce". Gregg Lipkin of PopMatters praised the album's [...] "shifting tones and musical invention". Sean Fennessey of Spin praised its bass-heavy tracks and called Big Boi [...] "a deceptively elegant rhymer". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commented on Big Boi's performance, [...] "He's got an inimitably slick and speedy flow and a personality bigger and more forceful than anything his producers can throw at him". Pitchforks Tom Breihan called the album [...] "inventive, bizarre, joyous, and masterful" [...] and stated [...] "He <b>just</b> <b>does</b> so many things with his voice and cadence, letting his words fall over the snares one moment and fighting upstream against the beat the next [...] blissfully free of both old-man hectoring and drug-rap nihilism".|$|E
500|$|Babe {{was billed}} as [...] "a no-nonsense, bustling busybody with a big heart", who is also both shrewd and tough under her bubbly personality. Badland {{described}} Babe as [...] "quite a private person" [...] that would [...] "protect her family", who she was [...] "proud" [...] to be in contact with again. She said she that Babe enjoys keeping [...] "control in a social way" [...] and that despite having a [...] "front of being jolly", Babe could also get [...] "very angry" [...] and be [...] "ruthless". She said that Babe {{is the kind of}} person who, when someone crosses her, <b>just</b> <b>does</b> and says the things that other people would not think of doing or saying until it is too late, and though she had tried to find trigger points that influence Babe's vengefulness, had realised that Babe was [...] "wicked" [...] just [...] "for the joy of it". Rebecca Scroggs, who plays Tosh Mackintosh, described Babe as [...] "a lovely woman" [...] with a darker side that could make her the [...] "most fearsome Carter of all". Badland also revealed that she never wanted Babe to be [...] "modified into a more ordinary person" [...] because she [...] "relished" [...] the character.|$|E
500|$|With Lisa {{now facing}} a long jail sentence, Marge decides {{to help her}} out. She starts reading Charles Darwin's The Origin of Species and becomes {{addicted}} to it. When the trial resumes, Marge tells Lisa that she now knows a way that she can help her. While Ned is being cross-examined by Clarice, Marge gives Homer a cold beer. Homer, ecstatic at getting a beer, tries to open it unsuccessfully. The more he tries, the more primitive he gets, hooting and banging the bottle on the bench, disrupting the trial. Finally, Ned loses his cool and refers to Homer as a [...] "big monkey-faced gorilla." [...] Clarice then asks Ned to compare {{the picture of the}} [...] "missing link" [...] and Homer shaking the beer over his head, and asks if he truthfully believes Homer cannot be related to apes. Ned cannot and concedes victory to Lisa. Lisa kindly tells Ned that she fully respects religious beliefs, but she <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not think it is proper for the church to dominate the school, the same way that Mr. Flanders and Reverend Lovejoy do not want scientists taking over the church. Ned agrees and offers to take Lisa and his kids out for ice cream.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director <b>just</b> <b>does</b> music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that I also like {{people to know that}} I don't currently and haven't in a long time." [...] Billboard reporter Carla Hay also noted, [...] "I don't think people who buy records are too concerned about the background of the video's director." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably soft-focus affair". The video was also added to MTV's 2000 Yearbook, a list with the [...] "biggest, best, most memorable music videos of every year since the beginning of MTV." ...|$|E

2500|$|Those {{defending}} Moyles {{have noted}} that Aled Haydn Jones, his show's producer {{who has worked with}} Moyles since 2001, is openly gay. He was quoted in The Guardian by Stonewall chief executive Ben Summerskill as saying [...] "Yeah, I'm homophobic, I don't like the gays. Sorry, it <b>just</b> <b>does</b> my head in.

2500|$|Akhtar {{has played}} for three English county cricket clubs: Somerset in 2001, Durham in 2003 and 2004 and Worcestershire in 2005. He did achieve his moments of success, such as taking 5 wickets for 35 runs for Durham against Somerset in the National League in 2003 and {{claiming}} 6 wickets for 16 {{runs in the}} same competition for Worcestershire against Glamorgan two years later, but he suffered from fitness problems, {{as well as a}} perception that he was less than interested in his task. This was particularly the case at Worcestershire: chairman John Elliott said [...] "Players like that are no good to our club. In fact, Akhtar has been no good for any club he's been at. He's a superstar and <b>just</b> <b>does</b> what he wants." ...|$|E
2500|$|His {{style has}} been noted for its unique instrumentation, {{utilizing}} {{a vast array of}} ethnic instruments, recorded sounds, synthetic textures, and the traditional orchestra, often concurrently. [...] When asked about his inclination for embracing new techniques and constantly shifting his musical palette throughout his career, Goldsmith said, [...] "It seems like it's me, and that's that! [...] Certain composers are doing {{the same thing over and}} over again, which I feel is sort of uninteresting. [...] I don't find that you grow very much in that way. [...] I like to keep changing, trying to do new things. [...] Basically, I'm saying the same thing with a little different twist on it. Once you get caught up in the creative process, something inside takes over, and your subconscious <b>just</b> <b>does</b> it for you." ...|$|E
2500|$|Beyond {{the lack}} of novelty in the {{projection}} itself, the claims Peters made about the projection were also familiar to cartographers. Just {{as in the case}} of Peters, earlier projections generally were promoted as alternatives to the Mercator. Inappropriate use of the Mercator projection in world maps and the size disparities figuring prominently in Peters's arguments against the Mercator projection had been remarked upon for centuries and quite commonly in the 20th century. As early as 1943, Stewart notes this phenomenon and compares the quest for the perfect projection to [...] "squaring the circle or making pi come out even" [...] because the mathematics that governs map projections <b>just</b> <b>does</b> not permit development of a map projection that is objectively significantly better than the hundreds already devised. Even Peters's politicized interpretation of the common use of Mercator was nothing new, with Kelloway's 1946 text mentioning a similar controversy.|$|E
