40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} state-level, tort law reforms on the diffusion of medical technology in the United States. The central thesis focuses on the diffusion of medical technology {{as an indicator of}} defensive medicine. Specifically, if physicians reduce their level of defensive medicine in the wake of liability reforms, this will show up as a reduction in the demand for and, more importantly, in the quantity supplied of medical technology. I discover after analyzing panel-data reflecting the availability of hospital-based diagnostic technologies by states and for the years 1987, 1990, and 1993 that differences in the availability of the technology are partially the result of state-level liability reforms. Moreover, there are significant differences in the impact of reforms on established (diffused) technologies and newer (<b>diffusing)</b> <b>technologies.</b> The results provide further evidence of the existence of defensive medicine and {{of the impact of the}} legal environment on the diffusion of medical technology.

This paper investigates the determinants and trend of foreign {{direct investment}} in Ethiopia for the period 1980 - 2010. A Vector Error Correction Model (VECM) approach in line with stationarity test, co-integration test and impulse response analysis is employed to dismantle relationship between foreign direct investment and its determinants both in the short run and long run periods. The finding assert that the economy's market size, domestic investment, openness of the economy, government consumption expenditure, inflation, exchange rate, debt servicing burden, interest rate, road infrastructure and governance quality are the main determinants of foreign direct investment in Ethiopia. The implication of this study is that even if there are no mere policy options that can trusted, policy prescriptions designed to affect certain variables in the economic, financial and socio-political models of foreign direct investment has to be examined carefully before they are put in effect.

40|$|The {{industry}} of ornamental stones of Santo Antônio de Pádua, {{located in the}} northeast region {{of the state of}} Rio de Janeiro/Brazil, is currently the most important productive activity in the region. Despite this, companies make use of simple and rudimentary techniques, which causes serious environmental and competitiveness problems. In order to seek a reasonable sustainability standard for firms operating in the sector, many research, government and civil society organizations have tried to develop and <b>diffuse</b> <b>technologies</b> in order to enhance the industry’s competitiveness.

The research study used a qualitative approach and sought to work with multiple sources of evidence such as an extensive bibliographical review, multiple case studies with semi-structured interviews with entrepreneurs and industry professionals, in addition to technical visits to local companies.

40|$|In {{the past}} China's rural areas, home to 70 % of its population, {{suffered}} energy shortages. China's indigenous energy resources are limited, {{with the exception}} of coal. The widespread use of coal requires large investments in production and transport -making it costly-, and degrades the environment. As a result the Chinese government has implemented an energy policy that aims at the use of renewable energy resources and increasing energy efficiency. For this the Chinese government has reorganised its institutional framework, which now aims at learning and improving profitability to <b>diffuse</b> <b>technologies.</b> Simultaneously the decision to use a technology has been shifted from officials to the consumers and profitability of a technology has become the main decision criterion.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of modern, efficient technology has far-reaching {{consequences for the}} geography of economic activity, inequality and environmental quality. This article examines two popular yet highly controversial claims about the conditions most favorable to the rapid spread of new technology. The first states that latecomer advantage allows developing countries to <b>diffuse</b> new <b>technology</b> faster than developed countries. The second claim, widely articulated by advocates of neo-liberal policy reform, is that new <b>technologies</b> <b>diffuse</b> more rapidly where countries are “open” to international trade and investment. To investigate these claims we use event-history analysis to estimate the determinants of diffusion speed across a large panel of developed and developing countries for three very different technologies. These are: continuous steel casting, shuttleless textile weaving looms and digital telephone mainlines. Our results broadly support both propositions. Countries which adopt new technology later or have a smaller existing capital stock – characteristic features of developing countries – <b>diffuse</b> new <b>technology</b> more rapidly than countries that adopt earlier or have more installed capacity – two characteristics of developed countries. Trade openness is also found to influence the rate of diffusion positively for all three technologies. Yet, consistent with recent empirical studies, we fail to find support for the idea that foreign direct investment (FDI) accelerates the {{diffusion of}} new technology in host economies. The article concludes by discussing the geographical implications of our findings...|$|R
40|$|This paper sets about {{identifying}} {{different and}} complex innovation practices across nine countries by exploring data from firm level innovation surveys conducted in nine countries: Austria, Brazil, Canada, Denmark, France, New Zealand, Norway, South Korea and the United Kingdom. Our {{results suggest that}} innovating firms in these countries adopt {{one or more of}} the following innovation modes: (i) ‘new-to-market innovating’, (ii) ‘marketing based imitating’, (iii) ‘process modernising’, (iv) ‘wider innovating’. The extent to which IPRs, external technology, design or marketing activities play a role in these innovation practices varies across countries. For example, in Austria, Denmark and New Zealand <b>diffused</b> <b>technology</b> (externally acquired R&D) is used together with own technology in bringing about novel products, suggesting a more open innovation pattern. In contrast, among firms in France, New Zealand and the UK we identify a greater reliance on IPRs (e. g. patents, copyrights and design registrations) while at the same time omitting externally acquired technologies. The latter may be interpreted as leaning towards a closed approach to innovation among a group of firms...|$|R

40|$|The factors {{affecting}} {{the diffusion of}} technical discoveries among firms and nations remain {{one of the most}} interesting and important but least understood elements of economic behavior. Recently, interest in technology diffusion has been heightened by a recognition that the spread of technologies could have important implications for environmental quality as well as for market goods and services. A specific motivation for this study was the question of how rapidly technologies that reduce greenhouse gas emissions might <b>diffuse.</b> <b>Technologies</b> in this category include technologies that improve the efficiency of fossil energy use or promote substitution of renewable energy resources. The speed with which these technologies spread could have a significant effect on the rate of accumulation of carbon in the atmosphere. From a modeling perspective, the rate of innovation and diffusion of carbon-reducing technology is known to be a crucial parameter in integrated assessments of climate change risks and policy responses. Thus, a better understanding of factors that might influence the spread of carbon-reducing technologies could be valuable in studies on long-term global change and policy assessment...|$|R
