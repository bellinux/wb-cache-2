50|$|As {{the world}} is {{becoming}} a more globalized society {{and more and more}} people are adopting the western consumption patterns, there has been a coinciding concern for the impact on our environment incurred by the production, distribution, use and disposal of consumer goods. As a result of this awareness, there are more and more consumers who take sustainability as an important factor in their consumer intent and behavior. Thus it has become beneficial for companies to also not only adopt sustainable practice but also to involve these concerned consumers in that practice. The first companies to adopt sustainable open innovation in their marketing strategies acknowledged that only providing more sustainable products and services, but leaving out a communication about those new practices would not be enough to encourage the rest of the market to be more sustainable. By opening their new practices to the consumer, they put themselves on a platform where others would have to do the same or <b>face</b> <b>failure</b> in the market. “There were some early developments in key industries during the 1980s and 1990s when the major players in the electronics industry collaborated with the goal of eliminating CFCs as a solvent in electronic assembly processes; and the quest for low emission vehicle technologies created some unprecedented levels of information sharing between the ‘Big Three’ car manufacturers. However, such collaborations were a long way from truly ‘opening up’.” This example represents the position that any kind of open sustainability innovation incurs on the market. Rather than seeking out a new product or new advertising scheme, companies look to each other as leaders in the industry, and customers, in turn have the opportunity to understand what they are really consuming.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the face {{stability}} analysis of Double-O-Tube shield tunnel. This kind of analysis is significant {{to ensure the safety}} of workers and reduce the influence on the surrounding environment. The key point of the stability analysis is to determine the supporting pressure applied to the face by the shield. A collapse failure will occur when the supporting pressure is not sufficient to prevent the movement of the soil mass towards the tunnel. A three-dimensional collapse failure mechanism was presented in this paper. Based on the mechanism of a single circular shield tunnel, the mechanism of Double-O-Tube shield tunnel was established by using the fact that both of the mechanisms are symmetrical. Then by means of the kinematic theorem of limit analysis, the numerical results were obtained, and a design chart was provided. The finite difference software FLAC 3 D was applied to investigate the <b>face</b> <b>failure</b> mechanism of DOT shield tunnel established in this paper; the critical supporting pressures of the collapse failure mechanism in different strata (sand and silt) were calculated. Through comparative analysis, the theoretical values were very close to the numerical values.

The kinematically admissible collapse mechanism defined to calculate the upper bound solution includes the action provided by a subhorizontal micropile at limiting conditions. The solutions are given in practical dimensionless charts which are useful to quantify easily the effect of the umbrella of micropiles. The plots provide a simple procedure to design the umbrella.
