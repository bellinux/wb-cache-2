500|$|Shinji {{is forced}} to fight an {{infected}} Evangelion Unit-03 and watch how its pilot, classmate Toji Suzuhara, is wounded (killed in the manga). Asuka loses her self-confidence following a defeat, and spirals into depression. This is worsened by her next fight, against an Angel which attacks her mind and forces her to relieve her worst fears and hidden insecurities. In the next battle, Rei self-destructs Unit-00 and dies to save Shinji's life. Misato and Shinji visit the hospital where they find Rei alive but claiming she is [...] "the third Rei". Misato forces Ritsuko to reveal the dark secrets of Nerv, the Evangelion boneyard and the <b>dummy</b> <b>plug</b> system which operates using clones of Rei. These succession of events leave Shinji emotionally scarred, and alienate him {{from the rest of}} the characters. Kaworu Nagisa replaces the catatonic Asuka as pilot of Unit-02. Kaworu, who initially befriends Shinji and gains his trust, is in truth the final Angel, Tabris. Kaworu fights Shinji, then realizes that he must die if humanity is to thrive and asks Shinji to kill him. Shinji hesitates but eventually kills him. [...] After the final Angel is defeated, Seele triggers the [...] "Human Instrumentality Project", a forced evolution of humanity in which the souls of all mankind are merged together through Rei. Shinji's soul grapples with the reason for his existence and reaches an epiphany that he needs others to thrive, enabling him to destroy the wall of negative emotions that torment him and reunite with the others, who congratulate him.|$|E
50|$|In the {{alternate}} universe game Girlfriend of Steel 2, Kaworu Nagisa pilots Eva Unit 05, which is otherwise {{the same as}} the Mass Production units, except that the <b>Dummy</b> <b>Plug</b> is replaced by a standard entry plug.|$|E
50|$|The pilot {{assigned}} {{to it was}} Toji Suzuhara, but in transit to Japan, it was possessed by the thirteenth Angel, Bardiel, which appeared as a cloud. As Bardiel, it was savagely torn apart by Unit 01, after the control of Unit 01 was switched from Shinji to the <b>Dummy</b> <b>Plug</b> system, designed to simulate an artificial pilot {{on the basis of}} Rei Ayanami's thought patterns. Toji, the pilot, is severely injured in the anime, but in the manga he dies.|$|E
50|$|These Evas {{appear in}} The End of Evangelion and were {{produced}} at seven different Nerv branches around the world, probably Germany (Third Branch), the United States (First Branch, Massachusetts), Japan (Matsushiro), the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and China. Units 05 and 06 {{were made in}} Germany; Unit 08 was produced in China. Seele had them produced {{as part of their}} backup plan for initiating Instrumentality, but only nine out of an envisioned twelve were completed. They are controlled directly by Seele via <b>Dummy</b> <b>Plugs</b> based on Kaworu Nagisa. In dialogue, they are referred to as the Eva Series (Evashirīzu).|$|R
50|$|Blanking <b>plugs</b> (<b>dummy</b> {{cylinder}} heads) can {{be inserted}} into empty yokes {{to ensure that}} there is no leak out of the yoke when not in use.|$|R
50|$|Rei {{appears in}} Neon Genesis Evangelion {{as a main}} protagonist and pilot of Evangelion Unit-00. Rei first appears in the first episode of the anime in an injured state after a failed {{activation}} test with her Evangelion. After she recovers from her injuries, {{she goes on to}} assist Shinji in defeating the Angels with their first major victory being against Ramiel. Rei's next significant Angel encounter occurs during Matarael's attack on Tokyo-3 where she cooperates with Shinji and Asuka to defeat the Angel. She then battles Sahaquiel alongside Shinji and Asuka. She is seen later when creating the <b>dummy</b> <b>plugs</b> for the Evangelions. She, along with Shinji and Asuka, later battle Leliel. She and Asuka attempt to overcome the Angel Zeruel, but are defeated. Rei is seemingly killed saving Shinji from Armisael late in the series yet she returns under mysterious circumstances; it is then revealed that the resurrected Rei is in fact the third incarnation of Rei, the first having been killed years prior to the series and the second having died in the previously stated incident.|$|R
5000|$|In The End of Evangelion, the Mass Production EVAs' Dummy Plugs are {{prominently}} marked [...] "KAWORU", {{suggesting that}} Seele was {{in possession of}} clones of Kaworu just as Nerv was in possession of clones of Rei for the <b>Dummy</b> <b>Plug</b> system for the original Evas. Kaworu makes his first appearance in the film during the initiation of the Human Instrumentality Project, sharing a body with the giant form of Rei. Later, Kaworu, along with Rei, appears in Shinji's mind and argues with Shinji {{in regards to the}} case of humanity and in favor of individualism and free choice.|$|E
50|$|The second {{release of}} the Proto 2000 BL2 came in a Blue-Green box and {{featured}} an updated motor, that was also insulated from the frame, better, cut down, flywheels, more traditional kadee type cupler pockets. The drive wheels were now updated to nickel silver, vastly improving power pickup. This version came with the, now usual, no spring, knuckle couplers, that were also based on the kadee couplers. these units were also equipped with a DCC-ready socket from the factory making DCC conversion easy. The <b>dummy</b> <b>plug</b> board, that was installed by the factory and allowed the locomotive to run with stranded direct current control, replaced the complex wiring for the directional headlights.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard Swedish plugs and sockets, RJ11 connectors are quite common, especially in offices. Even 8P8C modular telephone sockets can be found. Most telephone equipment sold in Sweden today has RJ11 sockets and corresponding cables with 6P4C plugs on each end and an adaptor from RJ11 to SS 455 15 50 sockets. The Swedish practice with sockets connected in cascade can be maintained with RJ plugs and sockets by using the first pair for connecting the terminal equipment to the PSTN and the second pair for the connection of a line towards the next socket. However, the presence function found in Swedish Standard sockets is lost, so disconnecting a telephone from its socket requires {{replacing it with a}} <b>dummy</b> <b>plug</b> so the sockets further down in the chain will remain connected.|$|E
5000|$|To power their massive frames, {{they use}} {{internal}} batteries, an umbilical cable, or an S² engine. Auxiliary batteries can {{be attached to}} extend an Eva's unplugged endurance. The Evas are controlled through their psychic link to the pilot via a combination of hand controls in the entry plug and direct nerve impulses that link to the pilot's plug suit and interface headset. The pilot's link with the Eva is expressed in a [...] "synchronization ratio". The higher the synchronization, the greater the command over the Eva. A high synchronization permits direct feedback, including the ability for a pilot to directly experience pain induced by any damage against the Eva. This {{is the reason why}} the pilots often undergo routine synchronization tests, in order to measure how well the pilots are able to synchronize with the souls that are bonded within the Evas. The Evas can also be controlled by an autopilot system, the <b>Dummy</b> <b>Plugs,</b> which are based on the thought patterns of either Rei Ayanami or Kaworu Nagisa. Evas can also lose control in certain circumstances and go [...] "berserk", such as when the pilot is under extreme stress.|$|R
25|$|As safety precautions, the {{built-in}} fuse for the warhead is released by a safety mechanism. This arms the warhead after a flight distance of approximately five meters. Once armed, the warhead will detonate on impact, {{and as a}} safety when the rocket's propellant runs out. This safeguards against live ammunition staying around and causing hazards to all in the future. The Panzerfaust 3 is distributed in a special package including spare parts and a cleaning kit. The package contains a launcher, ejector and spring, extractor, <b>dummy</b> extractor <b>plug,</b> bolt-head retaining pin, plastic cleaning rod with brass tip, bore and chamber brushes, camel's hair brush and a prismatic bore scope. It takes several minutes to assemble and load the launcher.|$|R
40|$|The core vessel inserts are {{the most}} target-near {{beam-shaping}} components in the neutron beam lines of the Spallation Neutron Source (SNS), and start at about 1 meter distance from the target center. These core vessel inserts will be replaced at component failure, when new needs of beam tailoring arise, or when plugged beam lines will be opened and the <b>dummy</b> inserts (<b>plugs)</b> will be removed. For these replacement scenarios, the activation of the inserts and the radiation field due to radioactive decay in the inserts were calculated, including cask designs for the enclosure of the activated components, using the MCNPX transport code and the ORIHET 95 activation tool. After 30 years of operation at 5000 hours per year and one week of cool-down, we calculate activity levels of the inserts that range from 150 to 700 Curies. Steel casks with wall thicknesses of up to 0. 36 m {{will have to be}} provided for shielding against the decay-gamma radiation. 1...|$|R

5000|$|Unit 01 (Shogōki) {{was created}} in the Third Annex of Gehirn's Artificial Evolution Laboratory in Hakone and is piloted by Shinji Ikari (with <b>Dummy</b> <b>Plug</b> as backup pilots). It is the first and the only Evangelion to be created from Lilith, the Second Angel, instead of Adam, the First Angel, from whom all the other Evangelions were created. Concept art for the TV series reveals that Unit 01's body was grown from biomass {{cultivated}} from Lilith's legs (the reason why her legs are missing throughout the show). Despite this fact, Unit 01 bears no real morphological difference from the other Evangelion units, possessing a core (unlike Lilith) and exaggerated proportions similar to Adam and the other Evas. Unit 01's armor is primarily purple; some components are colored neon green, light blue, orange, and black. Its helmet bears the signature unicorn-like single horn, and a 'frill', giving an appearance reminiscent of a ceratopsian dinosaur. The horn and the glowing eyes also gives the Evangelion a rather demonic appearance. It also has a distinctive chest plate resembling pectoral muscles, as opposed to the regular V-shaped chest plate the other Evangelions have. The humanoid entity beneath the armor has light brown skin, two emerald-green eyes, four small nostrils positioned, flat white teeth resembling that of humans, and red blood. It has the best battle record of all the Evangelions. It is a notorious berserker, and frequently acts independently, without the instructions of a pilot and without any apparent power source, moving freely even when the internal power source was depleted. The Eva will also take action to protect its pilot while sometimes servicing other interests. The Eva's resident soul, Yui Ikari (Shinji's mother), appears to be responsible for such events, in an attempt to protect her son. In such berserk incidents, the Eva goes into a 'battle rage', characterized by inhuman savageness and animal-like behavior. In the height of its berserk state, Unit 01 also demonstrates angelic abilities such as regeneration (repairing its damaged arm {{in a matter of seconds}} in battle against Sachiel and Zeruel), forming angelic cross shaped energy explosions, as well as manifesting a powerful AT Field for offensive purposes. It is the only Eva to have gone berserk in direct combat, inflicting fatal damage to Sachiel before it self-detonates, ripping apart Leliel and savagely mauling Zeruel. Shinji is clearly not responsible for these events, having blacked out in the first two berserk episodes and having dissolved into LCL after reaching a synchronization level of 400% during the battle with Zeruel. A similar state of battle rage, displaying heightened physical power and savageness, can be achieved when the Eva is controlled by the Dummy System, though this does not qualify as a genuine berserk incident. Unit 01 is called the [...] "Test Type", in reference to its unusual method of creation.|$|E
5000|$|... [...] With {{the use of}} Split-shot HEUI fuel injectors, high {{pressure}} oil is required to pressurize the fuel injectors. The main {{high pressure}} oil (HPO) system components are; High Pressure Oil Pump (HPOP), HPO manifolds, Stand pipes and branch tube. The HPOP {{is located in the}} engine valley {{at the rear of the}} engine block. Early build years (2003.5-04.5) are well known for pre-mature HPOP failure. This is due to the poor quality materials used in manufacturing. The HPOP is pressurized by a rotating gear, meshed with a rear camshaft gear. The early model HPOP gears were known to be weak, and develop stress cracks in the teeth resulting in gear failure, thus causing a no start issue for the engine. Early models also had the ICP sensor located on the HPOP cover. The high amount of heat in this location, combined with the exposure to debris in the oil was known to cause ICP sensor failure also resulting in a no start condition. This issue was addressed by Ford with the late 2004 engine update, bringing a new HPOP design, along with relocation of the ICP sensor to the Passenger side valve cover. The newly designed pump is not known for frequent failure, however a new issue arose with the update. In the late model engines, Ford also redesigned the HPO stand pipes and <b>dummy</b> <b>plugs</b> in the HPO manifold, using poor quality o-rings. These o-rings were prone to failure causing a HPO leak, and eventually a no start condition. Ford addressed this concern with updated Viton o-ring washers fixing the issue. With the new HPO system design also came a Snap To Connet (STC) fitting. Some models had issue with the prongs of the STC fitting breaking causing the fitting to lose it's sealing property and again, a no start condition for the engine. Another frequent (but not always catastrophic) issue with the HPO system is the Injection Pressure Regulator (IPR) screen. The IPR screen is located in the engine valley with the oil cooler. The material used was susceptible to failure and neglecting to replace the screen during an oil cooler replacement could lead to the debris being sent through the HPOP causing complete failure.|$|R

Anthony had previously {{been responsible for the}} visual design and build of EDP's [...] "Gnat" [...] version. Anthony's use of the distinctive black rubberized components to protect the controls and main casing has become one of its lasting features. It proved a great hit when touring as the rubberized ends reduced the need for a flight case. He even built into the ends a <b>dummy</b> 3-pin main <b>plug</b> to safely store the plug.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe chaperone/usher pathway {{controls}} {{assembly of}} fibres of adhesive organelles of Gram-negative bacteria.

40|$|Many {{virulence}} organelles of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens are assembled via the periplasmic chaperone/usher (CU) pathway. The {{assembly process}} is a complex task, involving secretion of organelle subunits via the two membranes and periplasm, subunit folding and assembly. In this thesis, the mechanism of the organelle subunit trafficking and assembly via the CU pathway was investigated at different steps, subunit capture by the chaperone (paper II), usher targeting (paper III), and transport through the usher (paper I), using the Caf 1 M/Caf 1 M CU system that assembles the Yersinia pestis F 1 capsular antigen from Caf 1 subunits. In paper II, we performed mutagenesis of the binding motifs of the Caf 1 M chaperone and Caf 1 subunit and analyzed {{the effect of the}} mutations on structure, stability, and kinetics of Caf 1 M-Caf 1 and Caf 1 -Caf 1 interactions. We show that a large hydrophobic effect combined with extensive main-chain hydrogen bonding enable Caf 1 M to rapidly capture/fold Caf 1 subunit. The switch from the Caf 1 M-Caf 1 contact to the Caf 1 -Caf 1 contact occurs via the zip-out-zip-in donor strand exchange pathway with pocket 5 acting as the initiation site. Based on these findings, Caf 1 M with improved chaperone function was engineered. In paper III, we elucidated the mechanism of the usher-targeting step at atomic resolution. We show that a pair of conserved proline residues in free chaperone forms a ‘proline lock’, which blocks the usher binding. Binding of subunit to the chaperone opens the proline lock and allows the chaperone-subunit complex to bind to the usher. We show that this proline lock exists in other CU systems and represents a general allosteric mechanism for selective targeting of chaperone:subunit complexes to the usher and for release and recycling of free chaperone. In paper I, a novel middle domain of Caf 1 A usher (UMD) was isolated and its crystal structure was determined. We show that UMD and Caf 1 fibre subunit displayed significant structural similarity. UMD did not bind Caf 1 M-Caf 1 complexes, but its presence was shown to be essential for Caf 1 -fibre secretion. The study suggests that UMD may play the role of a subunit-substituting protein (<b>dummy</b> subunit), <b>plugging</b> or priming secretion through the channel in the Caf 1 A usher. ...|$|R
