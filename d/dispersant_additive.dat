40|$|AbstractGasoline {{may contain}} {{additives}} which can minimize {{the amount of}} pollutants emitted to the atmosphere.

The Brazilian Agency of Petroleum, Natural Gas and Biofuel (ANP) has established that Brazilian commercial gasoline must contain detergent and <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives,</b> thus requiring the development of methods for their identification in commercial gasoline. This work proposes a methodology which uses infrared spectra in the medium and near region (MIR and NIR) of the residue of distillation for classification of gasoline samples into two groups: with or without detergent/dispersant additives. The performances of three types of classification methods were compared: linear discriminant analysis (LDA), partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the {{modification}} of clay properties with inorganic additives to deflocculate and flocculate inorganic soil {{for the development of}} a material that would be as easy to use as the current concrete products, but with a much lower environmental impact. Considering that the rheological behaviour of clays is controlled by their surface charge, we first introduce potential determining ions to deflocculate the clay particles and to reduce the yield stress of the earth material. Their efficiency is characterized using zeta potential measurements and rheological tests. We then achieve the flocculation of clay particles by using natural minerals that slowly dissolve in the interstitial liquid and ultimately precipitate calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H). The precipitation products are identified by X-ray diffraction and the consequences of this delayed precipitation are followed by oscillatory rheometric measurements. Finally, it is suggested that in this process, C–S–H precipitation is not used as a binding vector but as an anti-plasticizer that removes the inorganic <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{initiative}} {{led by the}} US Air Force {{concluded that}} advances in military fighter aircraft systems would require fuels with over 50 % improvement in heat sink capability over conventional JP- 8 fuel. This {{led to the creation}} of the "JP- 8 + 100 " program that demonstrated that the thermal stability of jet fuels (particularly JP- 8) could be enhanced through the use of particular additives used at relatively low concentrations. Additionally, flight-testing highlighted a significant reduction in fuel-related maintenance costs, arising from cleaner combustion. Inspired by the USAF success, and anticipated environmental and maintenance benefits, we attempted to design a conceptually new multifunctional species to enhance the thermal stability of jet fuels, without compromising other required essentials of jet fuel product quality, since one drawback found with classical <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives</b> has been a deleterious effect on water and solids separation characteristics. The present paper therefore describes the philosophy behind our additive development work, and gives results and conclusions of laboratory and large-scale tests conducted under this program. These demonstrate (a) the activity of the new type of additive in enhancing the thermal stability of JP- 8 fuel, and (b) the compatibility of additized fuel with existing conventional filter/water separation systems. © 2001 by the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics, Inc.

40|$|Diesel {{particulate}} filters (DPF) are {{an effective}} means for meeting increasingly stringent emissions regulations that limit particulate matter. Over time, ash primarily derived from metallic additives in the engine oil accumulates in DPFs. Lubricant-derived ash increases pressure drop and reduces fuel economy. After long time periods, the accumulation of ash may lead to irreversible plugging in DPFs, which necessitates periodic filter removal and cleaning. This thesis examines the sources for lubricant-derived ash in engines and explores potential opportunities to reduce ash emissions. The research studies changes in lubricant composition in the engine via advanced in-situ diagnostics and computer modeling of species transport in the power cylinder. These changes {{are directly related to}} ash emissions and the effectiveness of the lubricant in protecting engine components. In {{the first part of this}} thesis, sampling techniques are employed to determine the composition of the lubricant in critical locations in the engine system, where oil is lost by liquid oil consumption and vaporization. The first practical in-situ FTIR measurements of lubricant composition at the piston and liner interface are obtained with a novel diagnostics system employing Attenuated Total Reflection (ATR) spectroscopy. This information is used to create a mass balance for ash-related elements and a framework for modeling the distribution of ash-related species in the engine. In the second part of this thesis, a novel approach to condition the lubricant at a fixed station in the oil circuit is explored as a potential means to reduce ash emissions. This study examines the performance of an innovative oil filter that releases no additives into the lubricant, yet enhances the acid control function typically performed by detergent and <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives.</b> The filter has the potential to be used as a replacement for detergent additives in a lubricant formulation, or enhance additive effectiveness there-by allowing in an increase in oil drain interval. This research will assist in the development of new formulations for diesel lubricants that minimize detrimental effects on DPFs, while providing adequate protection to engine components. by Simon A.

Os fluidos foram preparados com 4, 86 % em massa de argila bentonítica e os aditivos estudados nas concentrações de 0, 025 g a 0, 300 g/ 24, 3 g de argila seca para os dispersantes e de 0, 005 g a 0, 300 g/ 24, 3 g de argila seca para o umectante aniônico. Os resultados mostraram que a espessura do reboco foi significativamente reduzida pela presença do umectante aniônico, sem, contudo, alterar as taxas de filtração dos fluidos estudados. Como era esperado, observou-se a redução nos valores de VA e VP após a aditivação dos fluidos com os aditivos dispersantes. Além disso, a mudança brusca nos valores de VA, VP e ER dos fluidos aditivados com o umectante aniônico na concentração de 0, 100 g/ 24, 3 g de argila seca evidenciou que esta é muito provavelmente a concentração micelar crítica deste aditivo.

30|$|Lubrication is {{the act of}} {{applying}} lubricants and lubrication substances, which are capable of reducing friction between moving mechanical parts. The main function of a lubricant is forming a film that separates two surfaces that roll or slide between one another, to reduce friction and eliminate wear. Lubricant additives are compounds or mixtures when incorporated in base lubricating fluid, supplement its natural characteristics and improve their field service performance in existing applications. The functions of lubrication additives are to reduce the oxidative or thermal degradation of oil, reduce wear, minimize rust and corrosion, lessen the deposition of harmful deposits on lubricated parts and prevent destructive metal-to-metal contact [4]. Detergent and <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives</b> are used primarily in internal combustion engines to keep metal surfaces clean by preventing deposition of oxidation products. Dispersants are typically the highest treat additives in an engine oil formulation. They are similar to detergents in {{that they have a}} polar head group with an oil-soluble hydrocarbon tail. While detergents are used to clean engine surfaces and neutralize acidic byproducts, their effectiveness is limited when it comes to dispersing oil-insoluble products resulting from the byproducts of combustion. Detergents {{are an integral part of}} any engine oil formulation. They are rarely the sole additive in a lubricant package and are often blended together with other types of additives [1]. Typically, they are blended with antiwear (AW) and extreme-pressure (EP) additives for use in engine oils, hydraulic fluids and metalworking fluids. Several studies have examined the effects of combining detergents with AW/EP additives such as zinc dialkyl dithiophosphates (ZDDPs), one of the most important chemically-active additives used in engines oils today. The purpose of detergents in crankcase oils is suspend/disperse oil-insoluble combustion products, such as sludge or soot and oxidation products, to neutralize combustion products (inorganic acids), to neutralize organic acids products of oil degradation processes and to control rust, corrosion, and deposit-forming resinous species [2]. One of the most important modes of lubricant degradation is oxidation. This oxidation is the primary cause of increase in viscosity, pour point, sludge, and enhanced engine corrosion and conventional liquid lubricants show poor oxidative and thermal stability at higher temperature ranges, which result in the formation of a vast quantity of volatile and solid products in the lubrication system [8]. The oxidation reactions that occur in a lubricant at elevated temperatures in the presence of atmospheric oxygen may lead to declined lubricant performance such as significant increase in kinematic viscosity observed in severe service conditions or during extended drain intervals [7]. In general, all types of base oil require addition of antioxidants depending on the amount of unsaturation and “natural inhibition” present. The refined mineral base oils contain “natural inhibitors” in the form of sulphur and nitrogen compounds sufficient for many applications [10]. Oxidation stability plays only a minor role in the process by which combustion chamber deposits are formed.|$|R
40|$|Particle {{size and}} its distribution, {{sedimentation}} bulk density and rheology of mullite, zirconia, and mullite/zirconia mixed suspensions {{have been studied}} in terms of oxide loading (20, 30 vol%), and types of <b>additives</b> (<b>dispersant,</b> dispersant/plasticizer, dispersant/plasticizer/binder). Polyester/polyamine, dibutyl phthalate, poly(vinyl butyral), and methyl isobutyl ketone {{have been used as}} the dispersant, plasticizer, binder, and liquid medium, respectively. Sedimentation density significantly increased upon adding dispersant; the effect was more pronounced with zirconia suspension most likely due to the fine and hence high specific surface area of zirconia. With further addition of plasticizer and plasticizer/binder, the sedimentation density decreased. The suspension viscosity generally behaved in an opposite manner to the sedimentation density, i. e., low sedimentation density gave high low-shear viscosity, indicative of high order structure formation in the suspended particles. High shear rate rheology showed a shear thinning and its onset began at lower shear rate with higher solid loading. Mullite/zirconia mixed suspension gave intermediate sedimentation and rheological behavior, implying the two types of particles are non-interacting. (C) 2002 Kluwer Academic Publishers...|$|R
40|$|International {{standards}} require lubricant formulators {{to develop}} additive packages that increase fuel economy, reduce environmental impact and minimise wear over ever increasing service intervals. However, additive behaviour and interactions between additives {{is not well}} understood. An absence of real-time technology has hindered understanding of additive behaviour and interaction between additives in tribo-contacts. The work presented in this thesis assessed whether electrostatic charge monitoring, which is sensitive to changes in surface chemistry, can offer insight into additive-surface behaviour and how this affects tribological performance. Electrostatic sensors were deployed on tribological test apparatus used to simulate: engine valve-train, manual transmission synchroniser and automatic transmission clutch tribo-contacts. Additive performance in these simulated contacts was assessed by electrostatic surface charge measurements and cross-correlated with friction, wear and off-line surface chemistry analysis. The first study involved electrostatic monitoring of valve-train contacts, which was a continuation of previous electrostatic monitoring work carried out to relate wear and electrostatic charge. During a simulated TU 3 cam-follower wear test, charge signals underwent a sign inversion; {{this was due to}} a transition between tribocharging of the lubricant under running-in and mild wear, and contact potential difference generated at the onset and progression of adhesive wear. It was found that charge signals differed between different oils, which could not be explained by the wear performance alone; this indicated that lubricant chemistry significantly affected charge generation. Dynamic charge peaks produced by simulated valve-train contacts lubricated with zinc dialkyldithiophosphate (ZnDTP) additive were related to the stripping of the tribofilm. The source of this charge peak was an increase in negative charge, which correlated with a dominance of phosphate and sulphate (anions) compared to zinc (cations), as the film was worn away. When friction modifier (FM) and <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives</b> were combined to lubricate a simulated wet clutch contact, x-ray photo-electron spectroscopy (XPS) analysis and friction data indicated that the dispersant dominated the tribofilm composition; evidenced by nitrogen levels and friction levels similar to the dispersant alone. Electrostatic charge data showed that competition for surface sites is an extremely dynamic process; as indicated by charge levels which alternated between the levels of the FM and dispersant alone. When a potassium borate additive was added to a polysulphide additive containing oil during testing (seeding), the charge data showed a transition from being predominantly positive to predominantly negative. This correlated with the formation of a borate rich (anions) layer on top of the sulphur film. Further novel tribological discoveries were found through investigation into these additive-surface charge behaviours. An underdeveloped ZnDTP tribofilm, which predominantly contained sulphur, was formed at room temperature; the sulphur promoted tribochemical wear and resulted in a pro-wear affect for primary ZnDTP. The combination of FM and dispersant showed a clear antagonism resulting in increased wear compared to the individual additives. XPS of brass and steel simulated synchroniser contacts lubricated with potassium borate and polysulphide identified the affect of surface chemistry on film formation. For the potassium borate additive: potassium (cation) preferentially adsorbed to brass, and borate (anion) preferentially adsorbed to steel. Seeding the borate additive into the oil, and therefore the contact, produced the same film composition and structure as the combination from the start. This inferred that the polysulphide additive drove initial film formation. Seeding is an extremely powerful technique, but its use is almost absent in the literature. It has been shown that lubricant chemistry dominates charge levels even in a wearing contact. Electrostatic monitoring is sensitive to the type of additive-surface adsorption and interaction between additive and additive or contaminant. Also, cross-correlation of surface charge and tribofilm chemical composition demonstrated that electrostatic sensors have the ability to detect tribofilm kinematics. This is a significant finding; no current real-time technique used to monitor tribofilm kinematics derives its measurements from the tribofilm composition. Although interpretation of electrostatic charge data is currently an intensive process, in the long term, lubricant development could see a move towards charge informed formulation.

40|$|Divers modèles, ayant pour but de prédire le taux d'imbrûlés solides lors de la {{combustion}} du fuel lourd, ont été mis au point dans le passé. Les paramètres entrant en ligne de compte sont le plus souvent les teneurs en résidus lourds hydrocarbonés (asphaltènes précipités au pentane ou à l'heptane et carbone Conradson) et en métaux : c'est le cas des modèles Exxon et Shell développés respectivement en 1979 et 1981. D'autres modèles tiennent compte, {{en plus de}} la composition du fuel, de son mode d'atomisation, de son mode de diffusion dans le foyer et de la cinétique de combustion : on peut citer les travaux du Laboratoire Energie du MIT publiés en 1986. Néanmoins, ces facteurs ne sont pas les seuls à intervenir : l'expérience a montré que l'état de dispersion des asphaltènes peut jouer également un grand rôle, notamment dans le cas d'installations de combustion à injection mécanique, pour lesquelles la dispersion des gouttelettes n'est pas aussi fine que pour des installations munies d'une injection assistée par la vapeur. Cette influence de la dispersion des asphaltènes sur la combustion a été mise en évidence dans le passé par l'utilisation d'additifs dispersants et également par la combustion de fuels lourds constitués par dilution d'asphaltes précipités au pentane avec un gas-oil de cracking catalytique de raffinerie (LCO). Ce sont ces fuels que l'on a considérés dans la présente étude. L'effet de ce facteur dispersion n'a pas été quantifié jusqu'alors, la difficulté étant de définir une grandeur mesurable représentant la répartition des agglomérats d'asphaltènes. Dans cette étude, on a essayé en un premier temps de faire une approche fractale de la répartition des asphaltènes à partir de clichés (préparés par la société Total), cette méthode ayant déjà été utilisée avec succès pour décrire des structures d'aspects comparables. Malheureusement, on s'est heurté à des difficultés relevant du mode d'exploration et de la non adéquation entre les structures asphalténiques et fractales. On a finalement opté pour une détermination visuelle s'appuyant sur les clichés sur lesquels les agglomérats d'asphaltènes sont clairement visualisés tels qu'ils sont dans le fuel. Ce mode d'exploration laborieux a cependant permis de déterminer un modèle construit sur une série de 25 fuels dont 10 ont été brûlés sur une chaudière de 2 MW, et 15 sur un four de 100 kW. Ce modèle fait intervenir les teneurs en carbone Conradson et en métaux, ainsi que le taux de dispersion des asphaltènes. Le perfectionnement des moyens d'exploration aidant, on peut s'attendre à ce que soient disponibles des techniques d'évaluation de la dispersion sur les clichés. Ce paramètre pourra alors être pris en considération pour une meilleure prédiction de résultats de combustion insuffisamment expliqués avec les paramètres classiques. Various models {{aiming to}} predict the amount of unburned particles (solids) during heavy fuel-oil combustion have been developed. The parameters taken into consideration are generally asphaltenes precipitated by normal heptane or pentane and Conradson carbon {{as well as the}} metals content having a known catalytic effect on cenosphere combustion in the combustion chamber. The Exxon and Shell models can be mentioned, which were developed respectively in 1979 and 1981 (Chapter II). Other models also give consideration to the fuel-oil composition, the way it is atomized and diffused in the chamber and the combustion kinetics (research done by the MIT Energy Laboratory published in 1986). However, the above parameters {{are not the only ones}} involved. For some fuel oils, experience has shown that the state of dispersion of asphaltenes may also play an important role particularly for combustion installations with mechanical injection for which the dispersion of fuel-oil droplets is not very great and does not affect the structures built up by asphaltene aggregates. This influence of asphaltene dispersion on combustion was revealed in the past by the use of <b>dispersant</b> <b>additives,</b> and more recently in the combustion of heavy fuel oils made up by the dilution of pentane-precipited asphalts with a light cycle oil (LCO). These fuel oils are considered in this article because a divergence has been found between prediction and the measurement of solid unburned hydrocarbons as the result of a more or less dispersed state of asphaltenes, depending on the conditions of diluted-asphalt preparation with a fixed fuel oil/LCO ratio. The goal has thus been to add on a term representative of this state of dispersion to the terms normally considered (asphaltenes, Conradson carbon, metals). To assess the state of dispersion of asphaltenes in fuel oils, pictures implying a special preparation of sample (taken by Total) were examined. These photos give a fairly representative picture of aggregate distribution in the fuel oil. To assess this dispersion, a fractal approach, which had already been applied successfully to describe structures with comparable aspects, was tried, but we came up against difficulties stemming from the exploration method and from the unmatching of asphaltenic and fractal structures. We finally chose a visual determination based on the photos in which the asphaltene agglomerates are clearly represented as they occur in the fuel oil (set of photos in the article). This laborious exploration method (liable to be replaced by image-scanning software) nevertheless enabled a more complete model to be designed for this type of production. This model was based on a serie of 25 fuel oils, ten of which were burned in a 2 MW boiler and 15 in a 100 IkW furnace. The characteristics of these fuel oils are given in Table I. The designations tau s and tau v represent the rates of surface and volume dispersion of the fuel oils expressed respectively in agg/µm² and agg/µm 3 (agg = agglomerates). Table II has to do with the nature of the fuel oils used (origin of the crude and method of preparation). The prospection methodology in creating the overall model is diagramed in a flowchart. The two series of fuel oils were burned respectively in a 2 MW boiler and a 100 kW furnace. The aim was to reduce them to a single serie of 25 measurement so that the model would have greater significance. The particles emission between the two installations were appreciably different, and so they had to be made comparable by a passage equationbetween the actual values obtained for the 2 MW boiler and the fictive values predicted by the intermediate model used (model of the 100 kW furnace). With the help of the passage equation, we were thus able to build a model on all the data. The model concerning the 100 kW furnace was taken as the intermediate model, and thus the values predicted by the overall model are directly applicable to the 100 kW furnace. However, the reverse passage equationhad to be applied to the fictive predicted values for the 2 MW boiler to obtain the particle emission corresponding to this latter installation...|$|R
