5000|$|Swaging is {{a method}} of wire rope {{termination}} that refers to the installation technique. The purpose of swaging wire rope fittings is to connect two wire rope ends together, or to otherwise terminate one end of wire rope to something else. A mechanical or hydraulic swager is used to compress and deform the fitting, creating a permanent connection. There are many types of swaged <b>fittings.</b> <b>Threaded</b> Studs, Ferrules, Sockets, and Sleeves are a few examples. [...] Swaging ropes with fibre cores is not recommended.|$|R

50|$|Threaded Fittings: {{commonly}} {{available in}} BSP or NPT (not interchangeable) they generally require a fitting {{attached to a}} pipe by other means to allow screwing into another <b>threaded</b> <b>fitting.</b> The exception to this is steel pipe, the ends of which can have the appropriate thread cut into them.|$|R
50|$|Tapered <b>threaded</b> <b>fittings</b> are {{sometimes}} used on plastic piping. Due to the wedging {{effect of the}} tapered thread, extreme care must be used to avoid overtightening the joint. The overstressed female fitting may split days, weeks, or even years after initial installation. Therefore many municipal plumbing codes restrict the use of <b>threaded</b> plastic pipe <b>fittings.</b>|$|R
50|$|A {{threaded}} pipe has a screw thread at {{one or both}} ends for assembly. Steel pipe is often joined with threaded connections; tapered threads are cut into {{the end of the}} pipe, sealant is applied in the form of thread-sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape) and the pipe is threaded into a <b>threaded</b> <b>fitting</b> with a pipe wrench.|$|R

5000|$|Electrical {{metallic}} tubing (EMT), {{sometimes called}} thin-wall, {{is commonly used}} instead of galvanized rigid conduit (GRC), as it is less costly and lighter than GRC. EMT itself is not threaded, but {{can be used with}} <b>threaded</b> <b>fittings</b> that clamp to it. Lengths of conduit are connected {{to each other and to}} equipment with clamp-type fittings. Like GRC, EMT is more common in commercial and industrial buildings than in residential applications. EMT is generally made of coated steel, though it may be aluminum.https://steeltubeinstitute.org/steel-conduit/types-of-steel-conduit/electrical-metallic-tubing-emt/ ...|$|R
50|$|Joints to {{fittings}} {{are made}} with slip-on solvent-welded connections, which set up rapidly after assembly and attain full strength in about one day. Since slip-fit sections {{do not need to}} be rotated during assembly, the special union <b>fittings</b> used with <b>threaded</b> conduit (such as Ericson) are not required. Since PVC conduit has a higher coefficient of thermal expansion than other types, it must be mounted to allow for expansion and contraction of each run. Care should be taken when installing PVC underground in multiple or parallel run configurations due to mutual heating effect of densely packed cables, because the conduit will deform when heated.|$|R
500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard suction hose sections, pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use <b>threaded</b> <b>fittings.</b> [...] In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R
50|$|Steel pipe is {{sometimes}} joined using threaded connections, where tapered threads (see National Pipe Thread) are {{cut into the}} end of the tubing segment, sealant is applied in the form of thread sealing compound or thread seal tape (also known as PTFE or Teflon tape), and it is then threaded into a corresponding <b>threaded</b> <b>fitting</b> using two pipe wrenches. Beyond domestic or light commercial settings, steel pipe is often joined by welding, or by use of mechanical couplings made by companies such as Victaulic or Anvil International (formerly Grinnell) that hold the pipe joint together via a groove pressed or cut (a rarely used older practice), into the ends of the pipes.|$|R
50|$|Today, {{plates are}} {{commonly}} attached with screws that mount into <b>threaded</b> <b>fittings</b> on the vehicle but originally nut-and-bolt combinations {{were needed to}} fasten the plate to a bracket, {{which led to the}} use of varied licence plate ornaments, accessories and attachments. The most common of these include fastening bolts with ornamental heads in a myriad of styles; these are generally legal everywhere providing the plate itself is not obscured. Those bolts faced with a colored glass or plastic reflector are termed licence plate jewels. Traditionally the front plate would be fastened by an amber or green jewel and the rear by a red jewel, but other colors have become available over the decades including blue, clear and, most recently, purple.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method used}} is {{referred}} to as electrofusion. Electrofusion is a method of joining HDPE and other plastic pipes with special fittings that have built-in resistive wire which is used to weld the joint together. The pipes to be joined are trimmed, cleaned, inserted into the electrofusion fitting (with a temporary clamp if required) and a voltage (typically 40V) is applied using a device called an electrofusion processor. The processor controls how much voltage is applied, and for how long, depending on the fitting in use. As current is applied to the resistive wire, the coils heat up and melt the inside of the fitting and the outside of the pipe wall which weld together producing a very strong homogeneous joint. The assembly is then left to cool for a specified time. The joints produced tend to be more reliable than <b>threaded</b> <b>fittings</b> sealed with O-rings.|$|R

5000|$|The model A had an {{optional}} inch or metric screw-cutting gearbox and power cross-feed. The {{addition of the}} letters, [...] "UD" [...] to the model letter signifies [...] "Under Drive". Model AUD is a Model A with the Under Drive mount. The four lathes (A,B, C, and T) were dimensionally identical but with different features. Model A was {{the top of the}} line with the screw-cutting gearbox. Model B was next with power cross feed and manual gear change for screw cutting. Model C had manual cross-feed and manual gear change for screw cutting. Model T was the Training lathe. The VSL (for late machines, VSL500) was an AUD with infinitely-variable spindle speed control, larger bore through spindle, 'L00' fitting for chucks instead of the <b>threaded</b> <b>fitting</b> of the other models and some other uprated features making it more attractive to industry. The lathes were based on the design of the very successful American South Bend Lathe models.|$|R
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight <b>thread</b> <b>fittings</b> or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without thread sealants, as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread seal tape or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread seal tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|R
40|$|The HEXPANDO is an expanding-head {{hexagonal}} wrench designed to retain fasteners {{and keep them}} from being dislodged from the tool. The tool is intended to remove or install socket-head cap screws (SHCSs) in remote, hard-to-reach locations or in circumstances when a dropped fastener could cause damage to delicate or sensitive hardware. It is not intended for application of torque. This tool is made of two assembled portions. The first portion of the tool comprises tubing, or a hollow shaft, at a length that gives the user adequate reach to the intended location. At {{one end of the}} tubing is the expanding hexagonal head fitting with six radial slits cut into it (one at each of the points of the hexagonal shape), and a small hole drilled axially through the center and the end opposite the hex is internally and externally <b>threaded.</b> This <b>fitting</b> is <b>threaded</b> into the shaft (via external threads) and staked or bonded so that it will not loosen. At {{the other end of the}} tubing is a knurled collar with a through hole into which the tubing is threaded. This knob is secured in place by a stop nut. The second assembled portion of the tool comprises a length of all thread or solid rod that is slightly longer than the steel tubing. One end has a slightly larger knurled collar affixed while the other end is tapered/pointed and threaded. When the two portions are assembled, the all thread/rod portion feeds through the tubing and is threaded into the expanding hex head fitting. The tapered point allows it to be driven into the through hole of the hex fitting. While holding the smaller collar on the shaft, the user turns the larger collar, and as the threads feed into the fitting, the hex head expands and grips the SHCS, thus providing a safe way to install and remove fasteners. The clamping force retaining the SHCS varies depending on how far the tapered end is inserted into the tool head. Initial tests of the prototype tool, designed for a 5 mm or # 10 SHCS have resulted in up to 8 lb (. 35. 6 N) of pull force to dislodge the SHCS from the tool. The tool is designed with a lead-in angle from the diameter of the tubing to a diameter the same as the fastener head, to prevent the fastener head from catching on any obstructions encountered that could dislodge the fastener during retrieval...|$|R
