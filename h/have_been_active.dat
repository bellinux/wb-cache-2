5|$|Nauru {{does not}} have any formal {{structure}} for political parties, and candidates typically stand for office as independents; fifteen of the 19members of the current Parliament are independents. Four parties that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> in Nauruan politics are the Nauru Party, the Democratic Party, Nauru First, and the Centre Party. However, alliances within the government are often formed on the basis of extended family ties rather than party affiliation.|$|E
5|$|The Long Valley to Mono Lake {{region is}} one of three areas in California that are in the United States Geological Survey's {{volcanic}} hazards program. These areas are in the program because they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> in the last 2,000 years and have the ability to produce explosive eruptions.|$|E

5|$|Cerro Azul {{is part of}} the South Volcanic Zone, {{which runs}} through central and western Chile and extends south to Argentina. This range {{includes}} at least nine caldera complexes, more than 70of Chile's stratovolcanoes and volcanic fields that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> in the Quaternary, and hundreds of minor eruptive centres. The South Volcanic Zone is the most volcanically active region in Chile, and produces around one eruption per year. Its largest historical eruption was at Quizapu Crater, located {{on the north side of}} Cerro Azul's summit (see below), and its most active volcanoes are Llaima and Villarrica.|$|E
5|$|Taxes were levied on {{artisans}} such as potters, sheep herders, weavers, oilmen, shopkeepers, stall owners, brewers and gardeners. Taxes on perishable {{items such}} as fish, meat, honey, medicine, fruits and essentials like fuel was as high as 16%. Taxes on salt and minerals were mandatory although the empire did not claim sole ownership of mines, implying that private mineral prospecting and the quarrying business may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active.</b> The state claimed all such properties whose deceased legal owner had no immediate family to make an inheritance claim. Other miscellaneous taxes included ferry and house taxes. Only Brahmins and their temple institutions were taxed at a lower rate.|$|E
5|$|In 1949 Sweden {{chose not}} to join NATO and {{declared}} a security policy aiming for non-alignment in peace and neutrality in war. A modified version now qualifies non-alignment in peace for possible neutrality in war. This position was maintained without much discussion during the Cold War. Since the 1990s however {{there has been an}} active debate in Sweden on the question of NATO membership in the post–Cold War world. These ideological divides were visible in November 2006 when Sweden could either buy two new transport planes or join NATO's plane pool, and in December 2006, when Sweden was invited to join the NATO Response Force. Sweden <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> participants in NATO-led missions in Bosnia (IFOR and SFOR), Kosovo (KFOR), Afghanistan (ISAF), and Libya (Operation Unified Protector).|$|E

5|$|Sister Peak (Comfortless Cove Hydrothermal Field, , {{elevation}} −2996m), Shrimp Farm and Mephisto (Red Lion Hydrothermal Field, , elevation −3047m), {{are three}} hydrothermal vents {{of the black}} smoker category, on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near Ascension Island. They are presumed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> since an earthquake shook the region in 2002. These vents have been observed to vent phase-separated, vapor-type fluids. In 2008, sustained exit temperatures of up to 407°C were recorded {{at one of these}} vents, with a peak recorded temperature of up to 464°C. These thermodynamic conditions exceed the critical point of seawater, and are the highest temperatures recorded to date from the seafloor. This is the first reported evidence for direct magmatic-hydrothermal interaction on a slow-spreading mid-ocean ridge.|$|E
5|$|The four bulleted lists below {{summarise}} {{the known}} participants to 1725 under each heading. The earliest important match that is designated inter-county was in 1709 {{and the traditional}} county soon became the key unit of organisation. Until 1725, only nine counties (plus London which has on occasion been equated in status with the counties of Middlesex and Surrey for cricketing purposes) had been mentioned in surviving records in connection with cricket and the earliest mention of each is summarised below. Note that all are in the south-eastern quarter of the country. In a similar vein, although not always in association {{with one of the}} above matches, those players, venues, clubs and teams known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> or in use by 1725 are also listed.|$|E
5|$|Two of Benn's {{children}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> in Labour Party politics. His {{eldest son}} Stephen was an elected Member of the Inner London Education Authority from 1986 to 1990. His second son Hilary was a councillor in London, stood for Parliament in 1983 and 1987, and becoming Labour MP for Leeds Central in 1999. He was Secretary of State for International Development from 2003 to 2007, and then Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs until 2010, later serving as Shadow Foreign Secretary (2015–16). This makes him {{the third generation}} of his family {{to have been a}} member of the Cabinet, a rare distinction for a modern political family in Britain. Benn's granddaughter Emily Benn was the Labour Party's youngest-ever candidate when she failed to win East Worthing and Shoreham in 2010. Benn was a first cousin once removed of the actress Margaret Rutherford.|$|E

5|$|Until recently, giant lemurs {{existed on}} Madagascar. Now {{represented}} only by recent or subfossil remains, they were modern forms {{that were once}} part of the rich lemur diversity that has evolved in isolation. Some of their adaptations were unlike those seen in their living relatives. All 17extinct lemurs were larger than the extant (living) forms, some weighing as much as 200kg (440lb), and are thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> during the day. Not only were they unlike the living lemurs in both size and appearance, they also filled ecological niches that either no longer exist or are now left unoccupied. Large parts of Madagascar, which are now devoid of forests and lemurs, once hosted diverse primate communities that included more than 20lemur species covering {{the full range of}} lemur sizes.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} dromaeosaurid {{body plan}} helped to rekindle theories {{that at least}} some dinosaurs may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active,</b> fast, and closely related to birds. Robert Bakker's illustration for John Ostrom's 1969 monograph, showing the dromaeosaurid Deinonychus in a fast run, is among the most influential paleontological reconstructions in history. The dromaeosaurid body plan includes a relatively large skull, serrated teeth, narrow snout, and forward-facing eyes which indicate some degree of binocular vision. Dromaeosaurids, like most other theropods, had a moderately long S-curved neck, and their trunk was relatively short and deep. Like other maniraptorans, they had long arms that could be folded against the body in some species, and relatively large hands with three long fingers (the middle finger being the longest and the first finger being the shortest) ending in large claws. The dromaeosaurid hip structure featured a characteristically large pubic boot projecting beneath the base of the tail. Dromaeosaurid feet bore a large, recurved claw on the second toe. Their tails were slender, with long, low, vertebrae lacking transverse process and neural spines after the 14th caudal vertebra.|$|E
5|$|William left England {{towards the}} end of 1086. Following his arrival back on the {{continent}} he married his daughter Constance to Alan Fergant, the Duke of Brittany, in furtherance of his policy of seeking allies against the French kings. William's son Robert, still allied with the French king Philip I, appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>active</b> in stirring up trouble, enough so that William led an expedition against the French Vexin in July 1087. While seizing Mantes, William either fell ill or was injured by the pommel of his saddle. He was taken to the priory of Saint Gervase at Rouen, where he died on 9 September 1087. Knowledge of the events preceding his death is confused because there are two different accounts. Orderic Vitalis preserves a lengthy account, complete with speeches made by many of the principals, but this is likely more of an account of how a king should die than of what actually happened. The other, the De Obitu Willelmi, or On the Death of William, {{has been shown to be}} a copy of two 9th-century accounts with names changed.|$|E
