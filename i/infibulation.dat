5|$|Typically {{carried out}} by a {{traditional}} circumciser using a blade, FGM is conducted from days after birth to puberty and beyond. In half the countries for which national figures are available, most girls are cut {{before the age of}} five. Procedures differ according to the country or ethnic group. They include removal of the clitoral hood and clitoral glans; removal of the inner labia; and removal of the inner and outer labia and closure of the vulva. In this last procedure, known as <b>infibulation,</b> a small hole is left for the passage of urine and menstrual fluid; the vagina is opened for intercourse and opened further for childbirth.|$|E
25|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM), {{another aspect of}} female genital modification, may additionally be known as female circumcision or female genital cutting (FGC). FGM has no known health benefits. The most severe form of FGM is <b>infibulation,</b> {{in which there is}} removal of {{all or part of the}} inner and outer labia (labia minora and labia majora) and the closure of the vagina; this is called Type III FGM, and it involves a small hole being left for the passage of urine and menstrual blood, with the vagina being opened up for sexual intercourse and childbirth.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{the forces}} {{underpinning}} female genital mutilation/ cutting (FGM/C) {{is a necessary}} first step to prevent the continua-tion of a practice {{that is associated with}} health complications and human rights violations. To this end, a systematic review of 21 studies was conducted. Based on this review, the authors reveal six key factors that underpin FGM/C: cultural tradition, sexual morals, marriageability, religion, health benefits, and male sexual enjoy-ment. There were four key factors perceived to hinder FGM/C: health consequences, it is not a religious requirement, it is illegal, and the host society discourse rejects FGM/C. The results show that FGM/C appears to be a tradition in transition. The World Health Organization (WHO, 2008) classification describes four types of female genital mutilation/cutting (FGM/C) : clitoridectomy, excision, <b>infibulations,</b> and other. Despite considerable variation in extent of genital tissue removed, instruments used, age at which it is performed, and termi-nology of the practice, common to all forms of FGM/C is that it involves “the partial or total removal of the female external genitalia or other injury to the female genital organs for cultural or other non-therapeutic reasons...|$|R
500|$|Communities may {{refer to}} FGM as [...] "pharaonic" [...] for <b>infibulation</b> and sunna {{circumcision}} for everything else. Sunna means [...] "path or way" [...] in Arabic and {{refers to the}} tradition of Muhammad, although none of the procedures are required within Islam. The term <b>infibulation</b> derives from fibula, Latin for clasp—the Ancient Romans reportedly fastened clasps through the foreskins or labia of slaves to prevent sexual intercourse. The surgical <b>infibulation</b> of women {{came to be known}} as pharaonic circumcision in Sudan, but as Sudanese circumcision in Egypt. In Somalia it is known simply as qodob ("to sew up").|$|E
500|$|The {{penetration}} of the bride's <b>infibulation</b> takes anywhere from 3 or 4 days to several months. Some men are unable to penetrate their wives at all (in my study over 15%), and the task is often accomplished by a midwife under conditions of great secrecy, since this reflects negatively on the man's potency. Some {{who are unable to}} penetrate their wives manage to get them pregnant in spite of the <b>infibulation,</b> and the woman's vaginal passage is then cut open to allow birth to take place.... Those men who do manage to penetrate their wives do so often, or perhaps always, {{with the help of the}} [...] "little knife". This creates a tear which they gradually rip more and more until the opening is sufficient to admit the penis.|$|E
500|$|Type III (<b>infibulation</b> or pharaonic circumcision), the [...] "sewn closed" [...] category, {{involves}} {{the removal of}} the external genitalia and fusion of the wound.

Type III is found largely in northeast Africa, particularly Djibouti, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Somalia, and Sudan (although not in South Sudan).

40|$|Background & Objective: According to the World Health Organization (WHO), Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) involves the withdrawal or {{damage to a}} part {{or all of the}} external genitalia of women without a medical reason. According to the WHO, 100 to 140 million girls and women worldwide are circumcised and in various studies, the numerous consequences of this action are mentioned. In this review, we investigated the studies on the outcomes of FGM. Method: In this study, the results of studies on the effects of FGM between years 2013 – 2003 in PubMed, Medline, Cochran library, Cinahl, Emro, WHO, Iranmedex and SID databases were investigated. In order to gather the information, first, articles that had one of the following keywords in their text (cutting / female {{genital mutilation}}, <b>Infibulations,</b> Female circumcision) either alone or with words Obstetrics / Gynecologic Consequence Psychiatric consequence health outcome, were searched and at the end a sum of 74 articles were collected. Results: FGM is accompanied with complications, such as infection, painful intercourse, frequent urination, constant bleeding, painful menstruation, infection during pregnancy, and possibility of developing hepatitis and infertility in women. But since only few case-control studies have been conducted on investigating these effects in different countries, it›s not possible to deduce from some complications associated with FGM. Conclusion: FGM is one of the manifestations of human rights violations and violence against women and girls who have the right to have a healthy body. Despite the global efforts, there are still areas of the world that respect this tradition, Thus stronger and more serious measures to stop such actions are strongly suggested...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{numerous}} {{publications and}} research material on FGC {{there exists a}} large perceptual discrepancy between localities where FGC is practiced, and those where it is not, complicating dialogue around the subject. This work studies those affected within their cultural environment and their socio-political and economic conditions. It has been important to maintain a respectful scientific perspective, and to understand both historical differences and differing stages of development. The author is from Eritrea, but grew up in Germany. Her goal {{is to examine the}} situations of circumcised and uncircumcised women in their native countries, and those now living in western society. Additionally the author conducted an empirical investigation between 1999 and 2005 both in Eritrea and in Germany. The perspective of this investigation stresses the context and social backgrounds of FGC, without neglecting the serious consequences for the women affected. The basis of this investigation was the examination of the health and psychosexual implications for circumcised women (N= 367) compared with uncircumcised women (N= 53) and also of men (N= 50) in Eritrea. The interviewed women were on average 28. 2 years old. The average age of the men interviewed was 37 years. There follows a comparative study examining circumcised women in Eritrea, with circumcised immigrants from the same cultural area now living in Germany. The women who reside in a culture where circumcision is approved do not connect their psychological illnesses with their circumcision, as circumcision is a part of their social identity and leads to a higher societal acknowledgement. There circumcision symbolically represents positive social values. Comparatively migrants to Germany suffer significantly through an insensitively handled public debate, and ignorance among medical staff. FGC is still seen positively in Eritrea  particularly in rural areas where school attendance amongst girls is lower than in cities, and female illiteracy rates are higher. It can be demonstrated that the rate of female circumcision decreases with higher levels of education. The situation in Eritrea is comparable with other African societies that still practice FGC - poverty, a lack of education and economic insecurity are shared characteristics of these countries. Additionally absence of basic medical supplies contributes to the high mortality rate amongst mothers and children, female circumcision, in particular <b>infibulations,</b> increases this rate. For most societies practicing FGC, it does not represent a central problem. Therefore international strategies to abolish FCG need to seek of improving living conditions in general within those societies. Condemnation of FGC does not assist the development of effective preventative measures. Only an understanding of the complex socio-cultural connections and backgrounds can contribute towards the development of viable abolishment strategies. These strategies must utilise the resources of the societies concerned in order to provide flexible, sustainable solutions. FGC is an intercultural and interdisciplinary challenge...|$|R
40|$|The works I examine in {{this thesis}} for Egyptian women’s {{narrative}} liberation strategies span from the nationalist-feminist works of the 1920 s in Egypt throughout the twentieth century. I include works by Huda Shaarawi, Zainab al-Ghazali, Nawal El Saadawi, Latifa al-Zayyat, the post- 1970 s generation such as Ibtihal Salem, Alifa Rifaat and Salwa Bakr and finally, Ahdaf Soueif. The works for examination are organised chronologically and surround anti-colonial independence struggles in Egypt. I argue that writing corporeality for contemporary Egyptian women complicates the modern national space and histories. Qasim Amin (1863 - 1908) is deemed Egypt’s feminist founding father. His modernist reformist discourse {{is one of the}} attempts to create the interstitial space for Egyptian women’s liberation in Homi Bhabha’s concept. Amin’s ‘imitative’ Western gender equality discourse renders the heterosexual relationship complex within Egyptian nationalist heteronormative discourses. It kindles numerous debates about Islamic definitions of womanhood. Not only does this cause the tension between Islam and Egyptian feminism but it also makes Islamic culture open to changes and a plethora of discourses. This thesis aims at assessing narrative strategies through female bodies, which form an interstitial space in Egypt’s histories. Romantic love narratives in contemporary Egyptian women’s writing re-signify national space. Re-writing heterosexual relationships in El Saadawi’s (1931 -) secular gender politics unsettles heterosexual constitution in Egyptian modern fiction, which disrupts a sense of a linear time in inventing national identities. Writing against Freudian masculine discursive power, El Saadawi distinguishes her feminist stance from Western feminist colonialist discursive hegemony. Her strategy renders an instantaneous frame of time, to use Bhabha’s concept. It targets the assumption of tradition as a nationalist discourse. Latifa al-Zayyat (1923 - 1996), through the creation of Layla in The Open Door, suggests that female sexuality can articulate historical perspectives of Egyptian modernity which has been dominated by male-centred views. The central space conferred on female sexuality in The Open Door reveals the symbolic representation of female sexuality in the male-led nationalist and nationalist-feminist debates. In Return of the Pharaoh, al-Ghazali (1917 - 2005) demonstrates her body to be able to endure tortures better than men; it involves a complication of the nationalist invention revolving around feminine ‘spirituality’, dependent on women’s roles of respectability. Her autobiographical writing is fluid between the personal and political and it becomes a vehicle for negotiating the national and female selves. Therefore, writing corporeality constitutes strategies for creating narrative time and space in Egypt as a nation. Also, Egyptian women’s writing techniques bring forth narratives of the lower class in Egyptian women’s movement. In the writing of the post- 1970 s generation, Ibtihal Salem’s (1949 -) daily description of women’s lives disrupts the masculine national linear time. For Salem, sexual life expresses disillusionment toward Jamal Abdel Nasser’s socialist nationalism, lament for neo-colonialism and the fundamentalist revival. Alifa Rifaat’s (1930 - 1996) representation of female genital mutilation integrates suturing, i. e. healing, and <b>infibulations.</b> Rifaat’s writing renders nationalist discourse split by demonstrating this practice as a sense of belonging and a wound, and thus, she creates an alternative space for nationalist discourses. The short story genre is a strategy of conveying Egyptian women’s culturally mixed daily life. Salwa Bakr (1949 -) devises female madness as a strategy to create new space within the domestic sphere. Her approach is based on revisiting Islam. She describes female psychological problems and carves out a representational possibility for Third World urban female subalterns. The zar ritual and psychoanalytic institutions introduce feminine circular time in Bakr’s works. Ahdaf Soueif (1950 -) adopts the feminine romance genre to seek narrative possibility for female sexuality and for formulating space for historical subalterns. I suggest that women’s corporeality in Egyptian modern fiction articulates a series of performative ever-changing national identities. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

500|$|It has {{affected}} more than 200 million {{women and girls}} who are alive today. The practice is concentrated in some 30 countries in Africa, the Middle East and Asia. FGC affects many religious faiths, nationalities, and socioeconomic classes and is highly controversial. The main arguments advanced to justify FGC are hygiene, fertility, the preservation of chastity, an important rite of passage, marriageability and enhanced sexual pleasure of male partners. The amount of tissue removed varies considerably, leading the WHO and other bodies to classify FGC into four types. These range from the partial or total removal of the clitoris {{with or without the}} prepuce (clitoridectomy) in Type I, to the additional removal of the labia minora, with or without excision of the labia majora [...] (Type II) to narrowing of the vaginal orifice (...) with the creation of a covering seal by suturing the remaining labial tissue over the urethra and introitus, with or without excision of the clitoris (<b>infibulation).</b> In this type a small opening is created to allow urine and menstrual blood to be discharged. Type 4 involves all other procedures, usually relatively minor alterations such as piercing.|$|E

2500|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} (FGM) is commonplace in Somalia (typically {{in the form}} of <b>infibulation)</b> but is illegal in the UK. UNICEF estimates that 98 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 in Somalia have experienced FGM. Three doctors working at Northwick Park Hospital in London, where a significant proportion of African women giving birth were Somali, warned in 1995 that due to growing Somali and Sudanese migrant populations, [...] "the problem of caring for infibulated women will be faced by most midwives and obstetricians at some stage". Also in 1995, Black and Debelle noted in the British Medical Journal [...] "evidence that the operation is being performed illegally in Britain...by medically qualified or unqualified practitioners and that children are being sent abroad for a 'holiday' to have it done". This latter practice continues, with children regularly taken to Somalia or Kenya in the school summer holidays for FGM to be undertaken. Estimates published in July 2014 suggest {{that the vast majority of}} Somali-born women in Britain have undergone FGM. The report, by Alison Macfarlane and Efua Dorkenoo, notes that some members of migrant groups continue to support FGM once in the UK, although younger generations are most likely to be opposed to it. A study published in 2004, based on research with a sample of young Somalis in London, found that 70 per cent of the females reported having been circumcised, two-third of these by <b>infibulation.</b> Of those who were already living in Britain before the usual age of FGM being performed, only 42 per cent had undergone the practice, whereas amongst those who moved to the UK after this age, the proportion was 91 per cent. The study also found that these younger people reported having less traditional views on FGM than their parents. 18 per cent of the female respondents and 43 of the males said that they intended to circumcise any daughters that they had. Some Somali women in the UK, particularly of younger generations, have spoken out publicly and campaigned against the practice.|$|E
2500|$|Significant {{controversy}} surrounds FGM, {{with the}} World Health Organization (WHO) {{being one of}} many health organizations that have campaigned against the procedures on behalf of human rights, stating that it is [...] "a violation {{of the human rights}} of girls and women" [...] and [...] "reflects deep-rooted inequality between the sexes". FGM has existed at one point or another in almost all human civilizations, most commonly to exert control over the sexual behavior, including masturbation, of girls and women. It is carried out in several countries, especially in Africa, {{and to a lesser extent}} in other parts of the Middle East and Southeast Asia, on girls from a few days old to mid-adolescent, often to reduce sexual desire in an effort to preserve vaginal virginity.

2500|$|There were {{recommendations}} to have boys' trousers constructed {{so that the}} genitals could not be touched through the pockets, for schoolchildren to be seated at special desks to prevent their crossing their legs in class and for girls to be forbidden from riding horses and bicycles because the sensations these activities produce were considered too similar to masturbation. Boys and young men who nevertheless continued to indulge in the practice were branded as [...] "weak-minded." [...] Many [...] "remedies" [...] were devised, including eating a bland, meatless diet. This approach was promoted by Dr. John Harvey Kellogg (inventor of corn flakes) and Rev. Sylvester Graham (inventor of Graham crackers). The medical literature of the times describes procedures for electric shock treatment, <b>infibulation,</b> restraining devices like chastity belts and straitjackets, cauterization or – {{as a last resort}} – wholesale surgical excision of the genitals. Routine neonatal circumcision was widely adopted in the United States and the UK at least partly because of its believed preventive effect against masturbation (see also History of male circumcision). In later decades, the more drastic of these measures were increasingly replaced with psychological techniques, such as warnings that masturbation led to blindness, hairy hands or stunted growth. Some of these persist as myths even today. Referring to such viewpoints and treatments, Ollendick and Schroeder stated: [...] "These are some of the darkest pages of religious and medical history." ...|$|E

The WHO includes this practice within Type IV FGM, because the added friction during intercourse can cause lacerations and increase the risk of infection. Because of the smooth appearance of an infibulated vulva, there is also a belief that <b>infibulation</b> increases hygiene.|$|E
