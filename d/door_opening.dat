5|$|A former hearse {{house at}} the {{southeast}} corner of the churchyard dates from about 1833, and has been converted for use as an electricity sub-station. It is a rectangular single-story building of red sandstone with a quarry tile roof. The <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> at the front has a wide semicircular arch with a keystone and springing blocks, above which is a string course and a cornice with moulded eaves. On the west side and at the rear are small vents with semicircular heads and keystones. The hearse house is listed at GradeII.|$|E
5|$|Upon the {{privatisation}} of British Rail in 1997, {{services were}} franchised to Wales & West, {{which was in}} turn succeeded in 2001 by Wessex Trains, an arm of National Express. The Wessex franchise was amalgamated with the Great Western franchise into the Greater Western franchise from 2006, and responsibility passed to First Great Western, a subsidiary company of FirstGroup, which was later rebranded Great Western Railway. Great Western Railway services to and from London Paddington started calling at Worle in 2007. Due to the trains being longer than the platforms, a selective <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> system was used to prevent passengers opening doors which were not adjacent to the platform.|$|E
25|$|Most {{doors are}} hinged {{along one side}} to allow the door to pivot away from the doorway in one direction, but not the other. The axis of {{rotation}} is usually vertical. In some cases, such as hinged garage doors, the axis may be horizontal, above the <b>door</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Earlier {{houses are}} small and have front <b>doors</b> <b>opening</b> into the single {{reception}} room. When they were built {{they would have had}} outside toilets. Tin baths were a common feature {{due to the lack of}} bathrooms. Later houses benefited from new legislation and have front <b>doors</b> <b>opening</b> onto a hall with stairs and often a second reception room.|$|R
25|$|To {{cope with}} {{increased}} demand, the class 378 units which {{operate on the}} line have been extended to five cars. Although the new stations on the line have platforms which are either at least five cars long or provide space for platform extensions, some stations cannot be extended and so selective <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> is required.|$|E
25|$|The units {{had many}} {{features}} which made them {{state of the}} art {{at the time of their}} introduction. This included the use of pneumatically operated sliding passenger doors (the only Mark 1 based EMU to use this feature), with passenger-operated <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> buttons. In practice, the doors were usually operated by the train guard (later driver, after modification for driver-only operation).|$|E
25|$|In Zell am See, Austria, {{an aerial}} lift connects {{the city with}} Schmittenh√∂he mountain. The gondolas {{sometimes}} run 24 hours per day, using electricity for lights, <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> and communication. The only available time for recharging batteries at the stations is during the brief intervals of guest loading and unloading, which is too short to recharge batteries. Supercapacitors offer a fast charge, higher number of cycles and longer life time than batteries.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, South West Trains {{acquired}} eight 2-car Class 170/3 {{units to}} supplement its existing Class 159 fleet. They were used on London to Salisbury services {{as well as}} a new Southampton local service, and on Reading to Basingstoke services. They were sometimes pressed into use on Waterloo-Exeter services but, as they were not fitted with end gangways for catering or selective <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> for the short platforms at some stations, this was not a regular route.|$|E
25|$|Meteorologists use radar {{to monitor}} {{precipitation}} and wind. It {{has become the}} primary tool for short-term weather forecasting and watching for severe weather such as thunderstorms, tornadoes, winter storms, precipitation types, etc. Geologists use specialized ground-penetrating radars to map the composition of Earth's crust. Police forces use radar guns to monitor vehicle speeds on the roads. Smaller radar systems are used to detect human movement. Examples are breathing pattern detection for sleep monitoring and hand and finger gesture detection for computer interaction. Automatic <b>door</b> <b>opening,</b> light activation and intruder sensing are also common.|$|E
25|$|Toward {{the end of}} the 1980s the 1940 {{rolling stock}} fleet was giving {{increasingly}} difficult service. The decision was taken to acquire new vehicles as an extension to a rolling stock acquisition programme on the Central line of London Transport (LT). This required implementation of fourth rail traction current system to maintain consistency with the LT fleet: a new aluminium centre current rail was provided. (The original steel positive rail was replaced by an aluminium one in 2008.) The new vehicles had passenger operated <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> buttons, which were unlikely to be required on the Waterloo & City line.|$|E

50|$|Among {{the four}} gates, the main was the western one. The {{dwellings}} were between 110 to 180 m2 in area. The dwellings {{of the outer}} ring were thirty-nine or forty, with <b>doors</b> <b>opening</b> towards the circular street. The dwellings of the inner ring numbered twenty-seven, arranged along the inner wall, with <b>doors</b> <b>opening</b> towards the central square, which was about 25 by 27 m in area.|$|R
40|$|Two refrigerator-freezers, {{one with}} a {{top-mounted}} freezer and one with side-by-side doors, were tested in the laboratory to determine the sensitivity of their energy consumption to various operational factors. Room temperature, room humidity, <b>door</b> <b>openings,</b> and {{the setting of the}} anti-sweat heater switch were the factors examined. The results indicated that the room temperature and <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> had a significantly greater effect on energy consumption than the other two factors. More detailed tests were then performed under different room temperature and door-opening combinations. The relationship of <b>door</b> <b>openings</b> and the equivalent test room temperature was established. Finally, the effect on energy of different temperature settings was studied. Test results are presented and discussed...|$|R
25|$|Shock waves {{gave rise}} to {{excessive}} boundary layer growth on the front ramp. The boundary layer was removed through the ramp bleed slot and bypassed the subsonic diffuser and engine where it would otherwise have caused excessive duct loss and unacceptable distortion at the engine. Since the ramp bleed slot was in the subsonic diffuser, and downstream of the shock system, changes in flow demanded by the engine would be accommodated with corresponding changes in the bleed slot flow without significantly affecting the external shock pattern. Engine flow reductions caused by throttling or shutting down were dealt with by dump <b>door</b> <b>opening.</b>|$|E
25|$|Class B trains {{were built}} between 1981 and 1994 {{to provide more}} stock to service the growing network in the 1980s. As with the class A trains, six prototypes were ordered. However, it took six years until the series {{production}} started and the prototypes had to be modified to match the series-production units. B units have {{the same size as}} A units but differ in the design (especially of the front window) and use three-phase current instead of direct current motors. The other difference is the <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> mechanism. On B units, the passengers only need to pull just one handle to open both doors rather than both handles as on A units. Of a total of 63 units, 57 are still in service (including one prototype), and six have been scrapped.|$|E
25|$|The next {{model to}} appear was the Model 200C in 1979; this version {{had a large}} cargo door on the LH side of the rear {{fuselage}} with an airstair door similar to the Model 200's door built into it. The <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> was 4ft 4 in (1.33 m) high and 4ft 4 in (1.33 m) wide, allowing a large range of items to be loaded into the cabin. The Model 200C found favour with many operators who fitted them out internally as Air Ambulances. The 200C was built from scratch {{rather than as a}} modification of the Model 200. The Model A200C military version was developed concurrently. In 1981, a Model 200C (c/no. BL-24) was modified as the Model 200CT, fitted with the same wingtip fuel tanks as installed on Model 200Ts; there was only one 200CT, but it led to other aircraft after an updated version of the Model 200 entered production.|$|E

25|$|Attached to {{the nave}} are {{the north and}} south aisles. The early 15th-century north aisle is of string-coursed ashlar, buttressed, with four windows of same {{appearance}} and stylerectilinear with inset three lights of simple round head, diamond-pattern leaded clear glazing, and flattened hood moulds. Three windows are placed on the north wall, the fourth serves as the aisle west window. Between the two north wall western windows is a simply moulded and slightly pointed <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> with hood mould and label stops, and a carved finial above. Within is a face-hinged oak door. The north aisle parapet is deeply crenellated to the same style as the tower battlements. Above the windows runs a moulding, defining the roof edge {{at the base of the}} parapet, holding two gargoyles which drain the aisle roof. Two double-stepped angle buttresses support the aisle on its north wall, with a third diagonal buttress at the north-west corner.|$|E
25|$|The central chancel east {{window is}} of five lights, {{separated}} by transom; the ten segments rise to pointed arches with cinquefoilslobes {{formed by the}} overlapping of five circlesand spandrels. The chapel window to the north is of four lights, foiled and traceried, with a central quatrefoil rosette. The smaller chapel window to the south is of three lights and foiled. The chancel and south chapel east windows contain stained glass; the north chapel is clear glazed. All three windows are pointed-arched with hood moulds. The north chapel north wall contains three windows, one rectilinear centrally placed between two pointed arched. The windows are of three lights, clear glazed, and dressed with hood moulds. The south chapel south side contains two Tudor windows, both wider than high. The window to the east is of two sections, each with three lights with arched cinquefoil heads, and is clear glazed. The window to the west is of five lights, again with arched cinquefoil heads, but with panel tracery above. Both windows are dressed with flattened arch hood moulds with label stops. Beneath the west window is a flattened-arch <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> with oak-panelled iron-studded door set within.|$|E
25|$|From {{the outside}} it is {{difficult}} to differentiate between the first three types of LRVs. There are, however, distinct features that one can use to tell them apart; Phase III LRVs still retain their original green electronic displays while all other LRVs have new orange electronic displays. Phase I cars also have a wide window at the rear that can be opened in case of an emergency, while Phase II cars have a door at the back. The interior of the phase three cars has a greenish look and the doors are also green. The Phase IV LRVs have a completely different appearance in contrast to the older phase. It has a white exterior livery with olive green and purple line on the side. The shape of the front of the LRV is more streamlined than the older phases. The <b>door</b> <b>opening</b> and closing mechanism was similar to the ones from the K-class cars used in the Tseung Kwan O line and Tung Chung line. The Phase IV has 3 surveillance cameras in each vehicle. Seat belts and wheelchair positions were also available in the Phase IV. On older-generation LRVs there is a poach seat but the Phase IVs do not maintain this feature. The Phase IV LRV has orange electronic display. The refurbished Phase I LRVs have rounded rectangular windows while Phase IV LRVs have square ones.|$|E

500|$|Dragon Quest III {{is noted}} for greatly {{expanding}} upon the gameplay {{of the original}} Dragon Quest and Dragon Quest II. The game uses basic role-playing video game conventions such as leveling up by gaining experience points and equipping items. The battle system is turn-based like the other games in the series, though the remakes incorporate various interface changes from later titles. These include simpler <b>door</b> <b>opening,</b> a bag to store items instead of keeping them at a bank, quick item sorting with [...] "Tidy Item" [...] and [...] "Tidy Bag" [...] command, and a [...] "Full HP" [...] command to automate the process of casting healing and status restoring spells. And while earlier Dragon Quest games were non-linear in structure, Dragon Quest III featured an even more open-world experience. It also allowed the player to freely swap characters {{in and out of}} their party and introduced the day/night cycle in which certain items, characters, and quests are only accessible at specific times of the day.|$|E
