60|$|Externally, awe {{and good}} manners forced Gillian to behave herself; but {{internally}} {{she was so}} far from patient, and had so many bitter feelings of indignation, that she felt deeply rebuked when she came <b>down</b> <b>next</b> morning <b>to</b> find <b>her</b> father hurrying through his breakfast, with a cab ordered to convey him to the station, {{on his way to}} see what could be done for Alexis White.|$|R
5000|$|Charger Challenge: Reverse Flick: Philippe gives each of {{the drivers}} a lesson in how to {{unbalance}} the car with a swift, slight turn of the steering wheel, and then spin it around 180 degrees with a larger turn of the wheel. The drivers are then given five chances to reverse the Charger into a turning area bordered by foam blocks, and spin it around in the area. Sholom is up first, and defies the dire predictions of Andrew and the experts by succeeding on his first attempt, finally passing a challenge. Actually getting the car into the turning area proves to be Renee's major issue, as it takes her until <b>her</b> fourth attempt <b>to</b> get in there without hitting the entry lane markers; once she actually does so however, she passes with ease. Andrew then tells her that with all the extra lessons that Jillian's been getting <b>to</b> help with <b>her</b> anxiety, it's only fair that Renee get the same for her fear of the highway. She's then sent with Tim for a drive on-and-off the Chedoke Expressway, which she then has to repeat three times; though she's initially very nervous, by her fourth and final run she's able to handle being on the expressway relatively calmly. Jordan fails his first attempt when he fails to steer in the reverse portion and hits the entry lane barriers, but on his second attempt he manages to pass despite not quite turning the car around fully. Polly fails {{to get into the}} turning space in four out of her five runs, and in the remaining run doesn't turn the wheel nearly far enough and skids through one of the side walls. After her run ends, Polly admits that her reversing is so bad that she had to cut <b>down</b> two trees <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> driveway at home, as she was constantly hitting them. Jillian also hits the entry barriers in her first run, after which Mitchell volunteers <b>to</b> monitor <b>her</b> speed while she focuses on where she's going; Andrew overhears this, however, and orders him out of the car {{for the rest of her}} run. All her subsequent attempts end with her needlessly hitting the brakes, which causes <b>her</b> <b>to</b> lose control and repeatedly crash through the walls.|$|R

She also studied in the United States, and received a Master of Laws degree (LL.M.) in International Human Rights Law from the University of Notre Dame in 2010. While pursuing these degrees, she also worked professionally as a human rights activist in Egypt. As a researcher at the Cairo offices of the Institut de recherche pour le développement, a French think-tank, she investigated the effects of divorce law and policy on Egyptian women's lives. Later she joined the Civil Freedoms Unit at the Egyptian Initiative for Personal Rights (EIPR), a leading domestic human rights group. There she focused on discrimination and violence against religious minorities. Hossam Bahgat, founder of the EIPR, later recalled: “One of the remarkable things about Yara is her ability to carry out professional work without losing sight of her feelings ... I remember in 2009 when there were attacks on Bahá'ís’ home in a village near Sohag, I came into Yara’s office while she was taking a testimony over the phone from a 70-year-old woman; the woman’s house had been burned down, she had been expelled from her village, and her only hope was to return to her home to die there. Yara hung up, put the phone <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and started writing on the computer while bursting into tears.” ...|$|E

How do you break that ice and start talking again? I knew I wanted it to have a snowball effect with the story. You see each other, and then this happens and this happens and this happens … like a snowball effect, where they’re together at the end. Like if I hadn’t of walked back in, then we would have never sat down to talk. If we hadn’t sat down to talk, we would never have had that glass of wine." [...] Batten also revealed, [...] "Clay told me after he heard it, he knew immediately that he wanted to cut it. He’s always told me that he’s been a big fan of the song, and he was instrumental in making sure that it was going to be a single. He said he believed in it as much as any song that he has ever recorded." ...|$|E

In the episode {{associated}} with this name, Red Horn turns himself into an arrow to win a race. After winning the race Red Horn creates heads on his earlobes and makes his hair into a long red braid called a he, [...] "horn", in Hocąk. Thus he becomes known as [...] "Red-horn" [...] (he-šucka) and as [...] "He who Wears (Human) Faces on His Ears" [...] (įco-horúšika). In one episode an orphan girl who always wears a white beaverskin wrap is pressured by her grandmother to court Red Horn. Despite the girl's adamant refusal, the grandmother insists. She eventually relents and goes off to find Red Horn, who is surrounded by other girls. She teases him, and unexpectedly, he smiles at her. The other girls were jealous, they push and shove her and tell her [...] "You don't know anything." [...] Red Horn and his friends prepare to go on the warpath and are camped just outside the village. During this time the women bring the warriors moccasins and the she brings a pair to Red Horn, who accepts them. When the warriors return from battle, they play a prank and have the sentries proclaim that Red Horn and one of his friends are dead. The grandmother begins to cut the hair of the orphan girl, as if she were already Red Horn's wife. When he comes into view and it is apparent that he is not dead, the grandmother laments [...] "I have wrecked my granddaughter's hair." [...] The victors dance for four days, and many of the young men approach Red Horn to recommend their sisters to him. He takes no interest, and asks instead, [...] "Where does the girl in the white beaverskin wrap live?" [...] At night Red Horn shows up at the girl's lodge and lies <b>down</b> <b>next</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Her grandmother throws a blanket over them and they are married. In another episode, with their lives staked on the outcome, the giants challenge Red Horn and his friends to play kisik (lacrosse). The best giant player was a woman with long red hair just like Red Horn's. The little heads on Red Horn's ears caused her to laugh so much that it interfered with her game and the giants lost, but Red Horn married the girl with the red hair. The giants lost all the other contests as well. Then they challenged Red Horn and his friends to a wrestling match in which they threw all but Red Horn's friend Turtle. Since Red Horn and his fellow spirits lost two out of the three matches, they were all slain.|$|E
