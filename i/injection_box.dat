50|$|In 2004, Peterson {{released}} the Virtual Strobe tuner model as a stomp box format. The StroboStomp2 replaced {{the first model}} in 2007. Both models of the StroboStomp featured true-bypass technology that would not 'color' {{the tone of the}} connected instrument and offered a studio-grade, on-board DI (direct <b>injection</b> <b>box).</b> The StroboStomp was discontinued in 2007. The StroboStomp2 was discontinued in 2009 and replaced by the VSS-C Stomp Classic. The StroboStomp, according to Peterson, was the first true-bypass tuner and the first strobe pedal tuner available commercially.|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn this work, we {{will present}} a swram {{optimization}} based approach to optimize die-temperature and pull-speed in pultrusion of thermosetting composite. Pultrusion is a composite manufacturing technique for processing continuous composite profiles with a constant cross section. The materials which are used for pultrusion in the industry are continuous glass fibers with polyester or epoxy resins. During composite processing, the reinforcing fibers are impregnated with a liquid resin in an <b>injection</b> <b>box</b> or resin bath, fibers and resin are preheated in a mold in which the curing process takes place. High productivity and low operating costs are the main advantages of this processing method. During processing, the heat flux provided by the mold must be sufficient to promote the polymerization reaction of the thermosetting matrix (curing). Furthermore, curing of a composite should be uniform and sufficient {{in order to provide}} a good quality of the end product. The exothermic character of the curing reaction induces, inside the composite, exceed temperatures. This temperature rise can cause degradation of the final product. Also, in pultrusion process, transport phenomena are involved and mathematical models are necessary to predict the physico-chemical behavior of the process. For such studies, the region enclosed by the mold is usually considered {{the main part of the}} process in which the curing reaction occurs and heat is transfered. Thus, the optimization process is quite important for the prediction of die-heating temperature and pull-speed...|$|E
40|$|The {{neutral beam}} {{injection}} system of ASDEX upgrade consists of two almost identical beam lines with four sources each. The main difference is the ion source: conventional arc sources are used for the first beam line, whereas the second beam line is equipped with new RF sources. Both types of sources deliver a mixture of atomic and molecular ions of hydrogen and deuterium. Hence the injected neutral beam consists not only of full energy neutral atoms, but also of atoms with half and third energy. The distribution of the different hydrogenic particles (protons and molecular ions) in the extracted beam, the species distribution, {{and the distribution of}} the neutral hydrogen atoms with the different energies in the injected neutral beam, the power distribution, of both beam lines have been measured by H_#alpha# Doppler shift spectroscopy in the neutralizers {{as well as in the}} duct between the <b>injection</b> <b>box</b> and the ASDEX upgrade torus vessel for hydrogen and deuterium beams. The RF sources yield a higher proton fraction than the arc sources. Accordingly, a higher fraction of full energy atoms is injected into the plasma: in the case of 60 kV deuterium operation, this amounts to about 72 % of the total injected power for the RF sources, compared to about 65 % for the arc sources. The agreement between the power distributions derived from the duct and the neutralizer measurements is satisfactory; the fact that the full energy fraction revealed from the duct measurements is slightly higher especially at higher energies may be related to the simplifying assumption of an infinitely thick neutralizer target in the calculations.

50|$|Like other electro-acoustic or {{electric}} instruments, an electric violin is often patched into a preamplifier, impedance-matching device, and/or a Direct <b>Injection</b> (DI <b>box)</b> box {{before it is}} routed to the PA system, electronic effects, or the instrument amplifier.|$|R
50|$|An unamplified {{acoustic}} bass' tone {{is limited}} by the frequency responsiveness of the instrument's hollow body, which means that the very low pitches may not be as loud as the higher pitches. With an amplifier and equalization devices, a bass player can boost the low frequencies, which evens out the frequency response. As well, the use of an amplifier can increase the sustain of the instrument, which is particularly useful for accompaniment during ballads and for melodic solos with long held notes. Like other acoustic instruments used with amplification, such as the jazz violin, a double bass is often plugged into a preamplifier, impedance-matching device, and/or a Direct <b>Injection</b> (DI <b>box)</b> box before it is routed to the PA system, electronic effects, or the bass instrument amplifier.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe piezoresistive {{properties}} of single-crystalline silicon nanofilms are studied. Resistors were fabricated on 130 nm thick SOI-silicon and measurements {{indicate that the}} conductivity is extremely sensitive to substrate bias and can therefore be controlled by varying the backside potential. Another important parameter is the resistivity time drift. Long time measurements show a drastic variation in the resistance. Not even after several hours of measurement is steady state reached. The drift is explained by hole <b>injection</b> into the <b>BOX</b> as well as existence of mobile charges in the BOX. The piezoresistive effect was studied and shown {{to be the same}} as bulk silicon...|$|R
30|$|All {{participants}} (203 {{patients and}} the control group) underwent an axial high-resolution T 2 W three-dimensional (3 D) gradient-echo FIESTA-C sequence at 3 T (Signa HDxt, General Electric, Strasbourg, France), using an eight-channel head coil. This sequence {{is a sort of}} modified steady state free precession sequence, which does not require any contrast <b>injection.</b> The study <b>box</b> was placed parallel to the orbital roof, extended from the orbital roof, downwards on 2.3  cm. The acquisition parameters were as follows: echo time (TE)[*]=[*] 0.8 – 1.2  ms, repetition time (TR)[*]=[*] 7  ms, field of view (FOV)[*]=[*] 22 × 19.80  cm, frequency[*]×[*]phase[*]=[*] 484 [*]×[*] 484, flip angle[*]=[*] 60 °, number of excitations (NEX)[*]=[*] 1, bandwidth[*]=[*] 83.3  kHz, partition thickness[*]=[*] 0.3 [*]×[*] 0.3 [*]×[*] 0.3  mm (isotropic voxel).
