50|$|Recently, the {{diffusion}} equation was thus mathematically investigated {{in accordance with}} the divergence theorem and the coordinate transformation theory. As a result, {{the diffusion}} flux should be determined by taking account of the concerned coordinate system of diffusion equation. Using the corresponding diffusion flux to the concerned coordinate system of diffusion equation for interdiffusion, one way diffusion, <b>impurity</b> <b>diffusion</b> and self-diffusion, we found that they are uniformly discussed and the foundation of diffusion problems is included in interdiffusion problems. The interdiffusion theory of an elements system applicable to every material was thus reasonably established. In the analysis of interdiffusion problems, the only difference between a binary system and an N elements system is whether the solvent material is one element or elements.|$|E

5000|$|The modern {{transistor}} has {{an internal}} structure that exploits complex physical mechanisms. Device design requires a detailed {{understanding of how}} device manufacturing processes such as ion implantation, <b>impurity</b> <b>diffusion,</b> oxide growth, annealing, and etching affect device behavior. Process models simulate the manufacturing steps and provide a microscopic description of device [...] "geometry" [...] to the device simulator. [...] "Geometry" [...] does not mean readily identified geometrical features such as a planar or wrap-around gate structure, or raised or recessed forms of source and drain(see Figure 1 for a memory device with some unusual modeling challenges related to charging the floating gate by an avalanche process). It also refers to details inside the structure, such as the doping profiles after completion of device processing.With this information about what the device looks like, the device simulator models the physical processes {{taking place in the}} device to determine its electrical behavior in a variety of circumstances: DC current-voltage behavior, transient behavior (both large-signal and small-signal), dependence on device layout (long and narrow versus short and wide, or interdigitated versus rectangular, or isolated versus proximate to other devices). These simulations tell the device designer whether the device process will produce devices with the electrical behavior needed by the circuit designer, and is used to inform the process designer about any necessary process improvements. Once the process gets close to manufacture, the predicted device characteristics are compared with measurement on test devices to check that the process and device models are working adequately.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the spatial}} {{distribution}} of carrier loss via radiative recombination is studied {{as a function of}} forward bias in the GaxIn 1 -xP top subcell of a GaxIn 1 -xP/GaAs double-junction tandem solar cell by using micro-electroluminescence (EL) image surveying. An inhomogeneity feature of the EL emission intensity is observed, in which the intensity is uneven and spatially nonuniform across the different cell regions. This feature shows significant dependence on carrier injection concentration. By evaluating the generation rate of EL emitted photons, the observed emission inhomogeneity is believed {{to be associated with the}} localization of minority carriers. The region with higher EL intensity is due to the stronger capturing of injected carriers, while the spatial nonuniformity of EL intensity is explained by the uneven distribution of trapping centers and the carrier filling effect of the trapping sites with increased injection levels. The localized trapping centers are possibly be incorporated by the intrinsic/structural defects, <b>impurities</b> <b>diffusion,</b> or the complexes of both.

50|$|The {{formation}} of embedded nanoparticles is complex, {{and all of}} the controlling parameters and factors have not yet been investigated. Computer simulation is still difficult as it involves processes of diffusion and clustering, however it can be broken down into a few different sub-processes such as implantation, diffusion, and growth. Upon implantation, silver ions will reach different depths within the substrate which approaches a Gaussian distribution with the mean centered at X depth. High temperature conditions during the initial stages of implantation will increase the <b>impurity</b> <b>diffusion</b> in the substrate and as a result limit the impinging ion saturation, which is required for nanoparticle nucleation. Both the implant temperature and ion beam current density are crucial to control in order to obtain a monodisperse nanoparticle size and depth distribution. A low current density may be used to counter the thermal agitation from the ion beam and a buildup of surface charge. After implantation on the surface, the beam currents may be raised as the surface conductivity will increase. The rate at which impurities diffuse drops quickly after the {{formation of}} the nanoparticles, which act as a mobile ion trap. This suggests that the beginning of the implantation process is critical for control of the spacing and depth of the resulting nanoparticles, as well as control of the substrate temperature and ion beam density. The presence and nature of these particles can be analyzed using numerous spectroscopy and microscopy instruments. Nanoparticles synthesized in the substrate exhibit surface plasmon resonances as evidenced by characteristic absorption bands; these features undergo spectral shifts depending on the nanoparticle size and surface asperities, however the optical properties also strongly depend on the substrate material of the composite.|$|E

40|$|Recently, high ionic {{conduction}} {{has been reported}} in nanostructured materials. This increase in conductivity can be important in technological applications, including micro-Solid Oxide Fuel Cells, so the understanding of this phenomenon is essential. In this work, XRD, Raman spectroscopy, SEM, EDS maps, and UV-Visible spectroscopy measurements are used to have an insight into the relationship between structural and electrical properties in nanostructured ytterbium stabilized zirconia (YbSZ) thin films prepared by ultrasonic spray pyrolysis. Raman measurements allowed the identification of a mixture of tetragonal and cubic phases at 4 % of Yb doping, which cannot be detected by XRD, while the compositional maps suggest that Yb can be located preferentially in the grain boundaries. Changes in the activation energy values in bulk and grain boundaries are related to the small grain sizes (≤ 10 [*]nm). UV measurements support the ionic nature of the charge transport. These results indicate that the high conductivity is a consequence of different physical parameters in the films such as stress in the materials, different crystalline phases, <b>impurities</b> <b>diffusion</b> to the grain boundaries, and {{the presence or absence of}} electronic conduction.

The program is entirely controlled by the user, who may simulate various diffusion models with different parameters, such as activation energies and bond energies. Thus, the evolution of an initial defect configuration as fed to the program - can be monitored in space and time, giving insight into the simulated model.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} equation for nonequilibrium interstitial impurity atoms {{taking into}} account their charge states and drift of all mobile interstitial species in the built-in electric field and {{in the field of}} elastic stress was obtained. The obtained generalized equation is equivalent to the set of diffusion equations written for the interstitial impurity atoms in each individual charge state. Due to a number of the characteristic features the generalized equation is more convenient for numerical solution than the original system of separate diffusion equations. On this basis, the macroscopic description of stress-mediated <b>impurity</b> <b>diffusion</b> due to a kick-out mechanism was obtained.
