500|$|Maxim Gorky {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Ordzhonikidze Yard, Leningrad on 20 December 1936 as a {{slightly}} improved version, Project 26bis as designated by the Soviets, of the first pair of Kirov-class cruisers, which were called Project 26. She was launched on 30 April 1938 and was completed on 12 December 1938. The ship, and her escorts, ran into the German-laid [...] "Apolda" [...] minefield in the Gulf of Riga while providing cover for Soviet <b>defensive</b> <b>mining</b> efforts on 23 June 1941 and Maxim Gorky and the destroyer Gnevny both lost their bows, although Gorky made it to port where temporary repairs were made. The ship was transferred, with assistance, to Tallinn and later to Kronstadt. She had a new bow section fabricated at Kronstadt and it was mated with the ship on 21 July. For {{most of the rest}} of the war she was blockaded in Leningrad and Kronstadt by Axis minefields and could only provide gunfire support for the defenders during the Siege of Leningrad, for example she fired 285 180mm shells on 4 September 1941 and 701 rounds during the Krasnoye Selo–Ropsha Offensive in January 1944. She also bombarded Finnish positions during the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive in June 1944. Maxim Gorky was repeatedly, if lightly, damaged by German air and artillery attacks, but her only extended refit occurred over the winter of 1942—43 when her upper deck was reinforced with 37-millimetre armour plates.|$|E
2500|$|Elaborate {{precautions}} {{were taken}} to preserve secrecy, since no continuous front line trench ran through the area opposite {{the west end of}} La Boisselle and the British front line. The L'îlot site was defended by posts near the mine shafts. The underground war continued with offensive mining to destroy opposing strong points and <b>defensive</b> <b>mining</b> to destroy tunnels, which were [...] long. Around La Boisselle, the Germans dug defensive transverse tunnels about [...] long, parallel to the front line. On 19 November 1915, the 179th Tunnelling Company commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were [...] away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with [...] of explosives, which was completed by midnight on [...] At [...] the Germans blew the charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide.

In addition to their offensive and defensive works, the Royal Engineers also dug deep wells to supply the troops with drinking water. In October 1915, the 179th Tunnelling Company began to sink a series of deep shafts in an attempt to forestall German miners who were approaching beneath the British front line. At W Shaft they went down from [...] to [...] and began to drive two counter-mine tunnels towards the Germans. From the right-hand gallery the sounds of German digging grew steadily louder. On 19 November 1915, 179th Tunnelling Company's commander, Captain Henry Hance, estimated that the Germans were 15 yards away and ordered the mine chamber to be loaded with [...] of explosive. This was completed by midnight from 20–21 November. At 1.30 am on 22 November, the Germans blew their charge, filling the remaining British tunnels with carbon monoxide. Both the right and left tunnels were collapsed, and it was later found that the German blow had detonated the British charge. The wrecked tunnels were gradually re-opened, but about thirty bodies still lie in the tunnels beneath La Boisselle.|$|E
5000|$|Naval mines {{were also}} {{increasingly}} well developed. <b>Defensive</b> <b>mines</b> along coasts {{made it much}} more difficult for capital ships to get close enough to conduct coastal bombardment or support attacks. The first battleship sinking in the war — that of [...] — was the result of her striking a naval mine on 27 October 1914. Suitably placed mines also served to restrict the freedom of movement of submarines.|$|R
5000|$|Submarine mining was the laying of <b>defensive</b> <b>mines</b> on {{the seabed}} about port entrances. In 1898 the New Zealand forces {{commander}} advised {{the government that}} Ellen Ballance was dangerous for laying out mines in anything approaching bad weather. He recommended that two [...] "proper" [...] submarine minelaying steamers should be acquired, one for Auckland and one for Wellington. This was approved, and in October 1900 the construction of two enlarged Napier of Magdala type vessels were ordered. These were named Janie Seddon and Lady Roberts.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the last}} 40 years left wing Non States Armed Groups (NSAGs) {{have been in}} {{conflict}} with the Government. This has resulted in the use of locally manufactured mines and Improvised Explosive Devices (IEDs), collectively described as [...] "mines". The Colombian military laid <b>defensive</b> <b>mines</b> around 34 of their bases whilst NSAGs and paramilitary organisations have used them in all aspects of their operations. The Colombian military have now completed clearance of 31 of the minefields they laid but an estimated 10,000 suspected NSAG minefields remain. These have largely been the reason why Colombia now has similar landmine casualties to Afghanistan.|$|R
2500|$|Early {{underground}} fighting at Carnoy {{had taken}} place in the winter of 1914 and spring of 1915. Mine warfare directly in front of Carnoy, near the Carnoy–Montauban road, was conducted by both sides from May 1916. In this southern-most sector of the British front line, which was allocated to XIII Corps, three mines were laid by 183rd Tunnelling Company. Two were to be fired north of Carnoy at 07.27 hours: a [...] charge under a German salient at Kasino Point and a [...] charge on the extreme left flank, intended to collapse German dug outs and destroy machine-gun nests. The third mine in the Carnoy group also held a [...] charge. As in the Mametz East sector, 183rd Tunnelling Company had to stop its <b>defensive</b> <b>mining</b> activities off Carnoy so the work underground could be finished in time. All deep mining was halted, except at Kasino Point where an inclined gallery was built. As the chalk grew harder, the method of softening involved drilling holes with a carpenter's auger, into which the miners poured vinegar. When it was fired, the mine produced a crater with lips [...] in diameter and [...] deep. The miners reported after the attack that the Kasino Point mine had buried three German dugouts and four sniper's posts, and probably a machine-gun emplacement as well. During tunnelling at Kasino Point, the British broke into a German dugout but were able to cover it up before the breach was noticed. Edmonds wrote in 1932 that this incident occurred during the digging of Russian saps rather than the Kasino Point mine. Middlebrook wrote in 1971 that the Kasino Point Salient was between Mametz, Carnoy and Montauban and the mine planted there was one of seven large mines that were due to be detonated at [...] on 1 July.|$|E
2500|$|The Mametz East group {{consisted}} of four mines in the Mametz sector, all laid by 183rd Tunnelling Company. Bulgar Point, a [...] heavily wired German strong work facing the 1st Battalion South Staffordshire Regiment's attack south-east of Mametz, was mined with [...] of explosives; a sap further west was loaded with a [...] charge {{in support of the}} Gordon Highlanders' attack; and two more [...] mines were laid beneath Austrian Trench, on the extreme right of the 7th Division's sphere of action, on the boundary with the front sector allocated to XIII Corps. In addition to placing the four mines, 183rd Tunnelling Company from February 1916 onwards prepared dozens of Russian saps for the attack, which ran from the British front line to {{the very edge of the}} German positions. Small charges could be blown from the end of these tunnels and they could then be used to reinforce the captured positions. Four saps were further equipped with Livens Large Gallery Flame Projectors, ready to cover the German front line with liquid fire. In order to protect them from enemy fire, the flame throwers were hauled into the saps just hours before the battle. Two tunnels which housed such weapons [...] – located at Kiel Trench south-west of Mametz and between Carnoy and Kasino Point – were damaged by German shellfire before the attack. The two remaining were put to use from saps immediately left of the mine crater field at Carnoy. In view of the work required, 183rd Tunnelling Company took a calculated risk by stopping its <b>defensive</b> <b>mining</b> activities between Carnoy and Fricourt, which had so far guaranteed the underground safety of the British trenches in that area. By 1 July, the British tunnel network excavated in this sector extended [...] under no man's land.|$|E
