The treaty (The Treaty of Pune) was signed on 13 June 1817. <b>Key</b> <b>terms</b> imposed on the Peshwa included the admission of Dengle's guilt, renouncing claims on Gaekwad, and surrender of significant swaths of territory to the British. These included his most important strongholds in the Deccan, the seaboard of Konkan, and all places north of the Narmada and south of the Tungabhadra rivers. The Peshwa was also not to communicate with any other powers in India. The British Resident Mountstuart Elphinstone also asked the Peshwa to disband his cavalry.|$|E
5|$|Basic Guides were {{formerly}} {{issued for}} students which, unlike the Resource Guides, {{remained the same}} from year to year. The Art Basic Guide focuses on art fundamentals, such as the elements of art, principles of composition, and different 2-D and 3-D techniques. Additionally, a brief introduction to art history is included. The Economics Basic Guide reviews fundamental economic concepts {{in addition to the}} basics of macroeconomics and microeconomics. The Language and Literature Basic Guide provides students with a basic grounding in the analysis of literature and introduces <b>key</b> <b>terms</b> such as synecdoche, metonymy, assonance, and aphorism. The Math Basic Guide offers a general overview of major topics in high school math, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and statistics. The Music Basic Guide begins by introducing the student to topics in music theory such as harmonics, rhythm, tempo, and the circle of fifths. It also includes information {{on a wide variety of}} instruments and a brief history of Western music. However, beginning in the 2010–2011 competition season, the Basic Guides were incorporated into the year's Resource Guides.|$|E

A query contains several words, where one of them will become a <b>key</b> <b>term.</b> <b>Key</b> <b>term</b> is a word that has higher information and value than the others in query. It can be used in any kind of text documents, including Arabic Fiqh documents. Using <b>key</b> <b>term</b> in term weighting process could led to an improvement on result 2 ̆ 7 s relevancy. In Arabic Fiqh document searching, not using the proper method in term weighting will relieve important value of <b>key</b> <b>term.</b> In this paper, we propose a new term weighting method based on Positive Impact Factor Query (PIFQ) for Arabic Fiqh documents ranking. PIFQ calculated using <b>key</b> <b>term</b> 2 ̆ 7 s frequency on each category (mazhab) on Fiqh. The <b>key</b> <b>term</b> that frequently appear on a certain mazhab will get higher score on that mazhab, and vice versa. After PIFQ values are acquired, TF.

[...] In the 1950s, Off-off Broadway theaters began experimenting with non-traditional theater roles, blurring the lines between playwright, director, and actor. [...] The playwright's job was not just to put words on a page, but to create a theatrical experience based on a central idea. [...] By 1967, theaters such as The Living Theatre, La MaMa E.T.C. and The Open Theatre were actively devising plays from improvisational scenes crafted in the rehearsal space, rather than following a traditional script.|$|E

500|$|The Liberal Temper {{makes the}} {{argument}} for the division between Plato and early Greek philosophy without a fully realised account of Havelock's theory of Greek literacy, which he was still developing throughout this period. Rather than attempting once again to explain his distinction between 5th- and 4th-century BC thought {{in terms of a}} dissection of the earlier school, Havelock turned, in his 1963 Preface to Plato, to 4th-century BC philosophy itself. He was interested principally in Plato's much debated rejection of poetry in the Republic, in which his fictionalised Socrates argues that poetic mimesis—the representation of life in art—is bad for the soul. Havelock's claim was that the Republic can be used to understand the position of poetry in the [...] "history of the Greek mind." [...] The book is divided into two parts, the first an exploration of oral culture (and what Havelock thinks of as oral thought), and the second an argument for what Havelock calls [...] "The Necessity of Platonism" [...] (the title of Part 2): the intimate relationship between Platonic thought and the development of literacy. Instead of concentrating on the philosophical definitions of <b>key</b> <b>terms,</b> as he had in his book on Democritus, Havelock turned to the Greek language itself, arguing that the meaning of words changed after the full development of written literature to admit a self-reflective subject; even pronouns, he said, had different functions.

5000|$|The {{following}} is an excerpt from a speech titled [...] "Americanism" [...] given by Warren G. Harding in 1920 regarding aid to European nations devastated by World War I. Terms bolded are those a critic might associate with the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Old World stabilization" [...] and terms underlined are those a critic might associate with the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> [...] "stabilize America."It's time to idealize, but it's very practical {{to make sure our}} own house is in perfect order before we attempt the miracle of Old World stabilization. Call it the selfishness of nationality if you will. I think it's an inspiration to patriotic devotion to safeguard America first, to stabilize America first, to prosper America first, to think of America first, to exalt America first, to live for and revere America first. Let the internationalist dream and the Bolshevist destroy.In this example, the critic would examine the cluster of words and phrases around the <b>key</b> <b>term</b> [...] "Old world stabilization" [...] in order to find certain patterns. Terms like idealize, miracle, dream, and attempt depict reconstruction through aid as an unproven strategy; internationalist and Bolshevist characterize supporters of aid as foreign and Communist; and the ending word 'destroy' implies a disastrous consequence for the proposal. In all, a critic can assume that these clusters work together to present aid for European reconstruction as an irresponsible and un-American plan.|$|R
