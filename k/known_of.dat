5|$|According to the {{contemporary}} historian Yahya of Antioch, the conspirators of 1022 were released by Constantine VIII after Basil's death in 1025, but Xiphias remained in exile until 1028, when the new emperor, Romanos III, released him. Xiphias, however, was by now too old and weary, and soon retired to the Stoudios Monastery. Nothing further is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from fighting Dyer ran various boxing gyms in London, successfully managing British flyweight champion Bert Kirby. Dyer {{then became a}} physical culture coach and was {{at the forefront of}} a diet fad in the 1920s based on fruit and vegetable drinks. Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his life after the Second World War and he faded into anonymity.|$|E
5|$|All that is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> the {{appearance}} of the castle is from contemporary drawings. Although these may seem fanciful to modern eyes, there are better preserved sites which share some features. Tutbury and Pontefract Castles both have similar gatehouses and chapels, and Tutbury's motte and Pontefract's curtain wall are also close in style to those in the illustrations. Sandal Castle has a multi-angular tower like those depicted, and this feature is confirmed at Melbourne by foundations which still remain.|$|E
5|$|Although {{little is}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> Ordener's youth, {{he was the}} son of commoners and joined the legion of the Prince of Conde (cousin to the king) at the age of 18 (1776). He was {{assigned}} as a private of the Boufflers Dragoons, part of this legion. In 1783, he was appointed to the quartermaster corps and in 1787, he was promoted to warrant officer. In the early days of the French Revolution, he adopted its principles with zeal and enthusiasm.|$|E

5|$|Anna Anderson (16 December 1896– 12 February 1984) was {{the best}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> several impostors {{who claimed to be}} Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia. Anastasia, the {{youngest}} daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia, Nicholas II and Alexandra, was killed along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Yekaterinburg, Russia; but the location of her body was unknown until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologically and ethnohistorically, Q'umarkaj is {{the best}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> the Late Postclassic {{highland}} Maya capitals. The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés' letters from Mexico. Although the site has been investigated, little reconstruction work has taken place. The surviving architecture, which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt, temples and palaces, has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build {{the nearby town of}} Santa Cruz del Quiché.|$|E
5|$|Archaeologists {{have not}} been able to recover enough of Kronans sculptures for a {{detailed}} reconstruction of the ornamentation. The mascarons (architectural facemasks) and putti (images of children) that were salvaged as of 2007 show considerable artistic quality according to Soop. A large sculpture of a warrior figure was found in 1987 and is an example of high-quality workmanship, possibly even a symbolic portrait of King Charles. Since nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> the surrounding ornamentation and sculptures, the conclusion remains speculative.|$|E
6000|$|Then the damsel said, [...] "If {{you should}} {{overcome}} this Sir Turquine, I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> still another adventure which, {{if you do}} not undertake it, I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no one else who may undertake to bring it to a successful issue." ...|$|R

5|$|As {{illustrated}} by the table of matches above, little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> organised cricket to 1725 {{because of the lack}} of newspaper coverage. The shortage of references in the latter part of the 17th century is due to the Licensing of the Press Act 1662 which imposed very stringent controls on the newspaper industry. Sport, including cricket, was not a subject to be reported and the few references found are in official records, such as court cases, or in private letters and diaries. It follows that equally little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> clubs and teams, players and locations.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from his}} death, remarkably little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> Cooke's circumstances. Even his {{date of birth}} is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well {{respected}} in his profession and following his death {{was the subject of}} tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in St Paul's Cathedral and his local church in Wiltshire.|$|E
5|$|Comparatively {{little is}} <b>known</b> <b>of</b> his other siblings: Hugh le Despenser fought abroad {{and died in}} Padua in March 1374, Thomas fought in France and died {{unmarried}} in 1381 and Gilbert le Despenser died in 1382. Their sister Joan was a nun at Shaftesbury Abbey until her death in 1384.|$|E
5000|$|Field Marshal Sir William Slim said of him [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> few commanders {{who made}} as many {{immediate}} and critical decisions on {{every step of}} the ladder of promotion, and I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> none who made so few mistakes".|$|R

5|$|Due to {{its limited}} {{distribution}} and similarity to other Adiantum species within its range, little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> its ecology. It thrives on sunny, disturbed areas where ultramafic rock {{is covered with}} thin soil, such as road cuts, talus slopes, and asbestos mines. Individual plants seem long-lived, and new individuals only infrequently reach maturity. It {{is one of four}} species endemic to serpentine in eastern North America and is considered globally threatened due to its habitat restrictions.|$|E
5|$|Edward, {{or rather}} {{those who were}} {{wielding}} power on his behalf, also appointed {{a number of new}} ealdormen to positions in Wessex. Little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> two of these men, {{and it is difficult to}} determine which faction, if any, they belonged to. Edwin, probably ruling in Sussex, and perhaps also parts of Kent and Surrey, was buried at Abingdon, an abbey patronised by Ælfhere. Æthelmær, who oversaw Hampshire, held lands in Rutland, perhaps suggesting links to Æthelwine.|$|E
5|$|First {{collected}} in 1964, it was formally described in 2009. The species {{may be most}} closely related to O.concolor and O.mamorae, which are distributed further north and south in South America. Among other characters, the three share a particular arrangement of the arteries of the head. Virtually nothing is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> its biology.|$|E

5|$|Following his feat, Daphnomeles was {{appointed}} strategos of the thema of Dyrrhachium by a grateful emperor, and given all of Ibatzes's movable wealth as a reward. In 1029, however, {{he was accused}} of conspiring with other prominent governors of the Balkans to overthrow Emperor Romanos III Argyros (r. 1028–34) in favour of doux Constantine Diogenes. The accused were then recalled to Constantinople, beaten, paraded through the Mese, and banished. Nothing further is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him.|$|E
5|$|From {{his later}} {{marriage}} to Matasuntha, {{he had a}} son, also called Germanus, born posthumously (late 550/early 551). Nothing further is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> him with certainty, although he can possibly be identified with the patricius Germanus, a leading senator in the reign of Emperor Maurice (r. 582–602) whose daughter married Maurice's eldest son Theodosius. Michael Whitby identifies the younger Germanus with Germanus, a son-in-law of Tiberius II Constantine and Ino Anastasia.|$|E
5|$|Her {{rule was}} finally ended by the {{politician}} Aulus Postumius, after she opted against Roman suppression. Very little is <b>known</b> <b>of</b> {{the rest of}} her life, but she was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC. According to the folklore of the modern inhabitants of Risan, Teuta ended her life in grief by throwing herself from Orjen Peak.|$|E
5000|$|He {{went on to}} say, [...] "The {{good news}} is that PAE has proven to be {{healthier}} and more resilient than any company we <b>know</b> <b>of</b> in the boat business. We <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other boat building company we’d like to trade places with." ...|$|R
5000|$|Regarding {{the case}} of JonBenét, Douglas contends that John and Patsy Ramsey did not kill their daughter. Of the case, he said: “Many crimes are tried {{in the court of}} public opinion long before they reach a court of law. But I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which the {{majority}} of people have decided the solution based on statistics. I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which the public substantially believes what has been reported in the tabloids. I <b>know</b> <b>of</b> no other case in which the mainline media have let the tabloids take the lead and then reported on their reporting.
