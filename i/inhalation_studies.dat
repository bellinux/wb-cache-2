This {{is supported by the}} positive results of the NTP bioassays with Ni sub-sulfide and Ni oxide in rats and mice. The human and animal data consistently indicate a lack of carcinogenicity via the oral route of exposure and limit the carcinogenicity of nickel compounds to respiratory tumours after inhalation. Nickel metal is classified as a suspect carcinogen; there is consistency between the absence of increased respiratory cancer risks in workers predominantly exposed to metallic nickel and the lack of respiratory tumours in a rat lifetime inhalation carcinogenicity study with nickel metal powder. In the rodent <b>inhalation</b> <b>studies</b> with various nickel compounds and nickel metal, increased lung inflammations with and without bronchial lymph node hyperplasia or fibrosis were observed. In rat studies, oral ingestion of water soluble nickel salts can trigger perinatal mortality effects in pregnant animals. Whether these effects are relevant to humans is unclear as epidemiological studies of highly exposed female workers have not shown adverse developmental toxicity effects.|$|E

50|$|Carbon {{black is}} {{considered}} possibly carcinogenic to humans and {{classified as a}} Group 2B carcinogen, because there is sufficient evidence in experimental animals with inadequate evidence in human epidemiological studies. The body of evidence of carcinogenicity in animal studies comes from two chronic <b>inhalation</b> <b>studies</b> and two intratracheal instillation studies in rats, which showed significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. An inhalation study was tested on mice, but did not show significantly elevated rates of lung cancer in exposed animals. Epidemiologic data comes from three different cohort studies of carbon black production workers. Two studies, from the United Kingdom and Germany, with over 1,000 workers in each study group, showed elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers. Another study of over 5,000 workers in the United States did not show elevated mortality from lung cancer in the carbon black workers. Newer findings of increased lung cancer mortality in an update from the UK study may suggest that carbon black could be a late-stage carcinogen. However, a more recent and larger study from Germany did not confirm this hypothesis that carbon black acts as a late-stage carcinogen.|$|E

Compared to <b>inhalation</b> <b>studies,</b> there is a tendency in intratracheal instillation studies that pulmonary inflammation lasted longer in the lungs.
