50|$|Hostas in the Undulata group {{include an}} all-green cultivar, Undulata Erromena; a white-edged cultivar, Undulata Albomarginata; and white-centered (medio-variegated) cultivars {{that may be}} grouped {{according}} {{to the amount of}} white in the leaf. The typical H. Undulata has a wide white center, wider than the green of the margins. Over time (or as a cultivar selection), the white center can narrow to a form classified as H. Undulata Univittata; the <b>displayed</b> <b>picture</b> is more of this type. These four are the only registered Undulata cultivar names. Other names for the white-centered forms include Undulata variegata, Undulata mediopicta, and registered forms such as H. Middle Ridge and White Feather. The expansion of the green margins (narrowing of the center) depends on garden culture. In time, the all-green Undulata Erromena cultivar may appear. As this all-green form is significantly more vigorous than the variegated form, it can quickly overwhelm a planting of Undulata. Division of the fast-growing clumps to remove undesired leaf forms is easily accomplished.|$|E

40|$|When {{errors are}} {{introduced}} into a compressed image or video bitstream, blocks of pixels are lost. The decoder attempts to conceal this loss to maximize <b>displayed</b> <b>picture</b> quality. We discuss {{a few different}} conditions under which satisfactory interpolation of the missing blocks is possible. For images, these conditions include situations where the image is locally smooth or locally one dimensional. For video, {{in addition to the}} conditions for images, satisfactory concealment is also possible when the current frame is locally a translation of the previous frame. In order to obtain a concealment strategy which will perform satisfactorily whenever any of these conditions is present, we model images and videos as mixtures of simple Markov processes, where each of the simple processes represent one possible condition for satisfactory concealment. We then use Bayesian reasoning for performing the optimal interpolation using the model. 1 Introduction Perfect transmission of information over l [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The present {{experiment}} investigates whether {{young children}} are able to reduce their false recognition rate after distinctive encoding by implementing a strategic metacognitive rule. Seventy-two children, aged 4, 6, and 9 years, studied two lists of unrelated items. One of these lists was visually <b>displayed</b> (<b>picture</b> condition) while the other was presented auditorily (word condition). After each study phase, participants completed recognition tests. Finally, they answered questions about their explicit knowledge of the distinctive-encoding effect. The results revealed that even the youngest children in our sample showed a smaller proportion of intrusions in the picture condition than in the word condition. Furthermore, {{the results of the}} signal detection analyses were consistent with the hypothesis that the lower rate of false recognitions after picture encoding results from the implementation of a conservative response criterion based on metacognitive expectations (distinctiveness heuristic). Moreover, the absence of correlation between children’s explicit knowledge of the distinctiveness rule and their effective use of this metacognitive heuristic seems to indicate that its involvement in memory decisions could be mediated by implicit mechanisms.

40|$|For group-living animals, it {{is crucial}} to {{distinguish}} one’s own group members from those of other groups. Studies applying operant conditioning revealed that monkeys living in relatively small groups are able to recognize their own group members when tested with photographs of group members and other conspecifics. Employing a simple looking time paradigm, we here show that Barbary macaques living in two social groups comprising 46 and 57 individuals, respectively, at the enclosure ‘La Forêt des Singes’ at Rocamadour are able to spontaneously distinguish photographs of members of their own group from those depicting animals that belong to another group. This ability appears to develop with age, as juveniles did not discriminate between members of their own group and another group, although they showed generally more interest in the pictures than did adults. Juveniles frequently <b>displayed</b> <b>picture</b> directed behaviours such as lip-smacking, touching and sniffing in both conditions, indicating that the stimuli were highly salient to them. In conclusion, it appears that at least adult monkeys are able to memorize the faces {{of a large number of}} individuals. Whether the difference in behaviour is based on individual recognition of one’s own group members or simply the discrimination based on familiarity remains unresolved. However, both mechanisms would be sufficient for group membership identification...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to characterize, using fMRI, the {{functional}} asymmetries of hand laterality task (HLT) in a sample of 295 participants balanced for handedness. During HLT, participants have to decide whether the <b>displayed</b> <b>picture</b> of a hand represent a right or a left hand. Pictures of hands' back view were presented for 150 ms in the right or left hemifield. At the whole hemisphere level, we evidenced that the laterality of the hand and of the hemifield in which the picture was displayed combined their effects on the hemispheric asymmetry in an additive way. We then identified a set of 17 functional homotopic regions of interest (hROIs) including premotor, motor, somatosensory and parietal regions, whose activity and asymmetry varied with the laterality of the presented hands. When the laterality of a right hand had to be evaluated, these areas showed stronger leftward asymmetry, the hROI located in the primary motor area showing a significant larger effect than all other hROIs. In addition a subset of six parietal regions involved in visuo-motor integration together with two postcentral areas showed a variation in asymmetry with hemifield of presentation. Finally, while handedness had no effect at the hemispheric level, two regions located in the parietal operculum and intraparietal sulcus exhibited larger leftward asymmetry with right handedness independently of the hand of presentation. The present results extend those of previous works in showing a shift of asymmetries during HLT according to the hand presented in sensorimotor areas including primary motor cortex. This shift was not affected by manual preference. They also demonstrate that the coordination of visual information and handedness identification of hands relied on the coexistence of contralateral motor and visual representations in the superior parietal lobe and the postcentral gyrus...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Viewdata systems in commercial use at present offer the facility for transmitting alphanumeric text and graphic displays via the public switched telephone network. An enhancement to the system would be to transmit true video images instead of graphics. Such a system, under development in Britain at present uses Differential Pulse Code Modulation (DPCM) and a transmission rate of 1200 bits/sec. Error protection is achieved {{by the use of}} error protection codes, which increases the channel requirement. In this thesis, error detection and correction of DPCM coded video signals without the use of channel error protection is studied. The scheme operates entirely at the receiver by examining the local statistics of the received data to determine the presence of errors. Error correction is then undertaken by interpolation from adjacent correct or previousiy corrected data. DPCM coding of pictures has the inherent disadvantage of a slow build-up of the <b>displayed</b> <b>picture</b> at the receiver and difficulties with image size manipulation. In order to fit the pictorial information into a viewdata page, its size has to be reduced. Unitary transforms, typically the discrete Fourier transform (DFT), the discrete cosine transform (DCT) and the Hadamard transform (HT) enable lowpass filtering and decimation to be carried out in a single operation in the transform domain. Size reductions of different orders are considered and the merits of the DFT, DCT and HT are investigated. With limited channel capacity, it is desirable to remove the redundancy present in the source picture {{in order to reduce the}} bit rate. Orthogonal transformation decorrelates the spatial sample distribution and packs most of the image energy in the low order coefficients. This property is exploited in bit-reduction schemes which are adaptive to the local statistics of the different source pictures used. In some cases, bit rates of less than 1. 0 bit/pel are achieved with satisfactory received picture quality. Unlike DPCM systems, transform coding has the advantage of being able to display rapidly a picture of low resolution by initial inverse transformation of the low order coefficients only. Picture resolution is then progressively built up as more coefficients are received and decoded. Different sequences of picture update are investigated to find that which achieves the best subjective quality with the fewest possible coefficients transmitted...|$|E
