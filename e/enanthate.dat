25|$|Prasterone is used {{medically}} as the C3β esters prasterone <b>enanthate</b> and prasterone sodium sulfate. Another derivative is fluasterone (16α-fluoro-DHEA).|$|E
25|$|Designer steroids are AAS {{that have}} not been {{approved}} and marketed for medical use but have been distributed through the black market. Examples of notable designer steroids include 1-testosterone (dihydroboldenone), methasterone, trenbolone <b>enanthate,</b> desoxymethyltestosterone, tetrahydrogestrinone, and methylstenbolone.|$|E
25|$|Strength {{improvements}} {{in the range of}} 5–20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by testosterone <b>enanthate</b> at 600nbsp&mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. This dose is sufficient to significantly improve lean muscle mass relative to placebo even in subjects that did not exercise at all. The anabolic effects of testosterone <b>enanthate</b> were highly dose dependent.|$|E
25|$|Several C17β ester prodrugs of DHT, {{including}} androstanolone benzoate, androstanolone <b>enanthate,</b> androstanolone propionate, and androstanolone valerate, {{have been}} developed and introduced for medical use as AAS. Conversely, dihydrotestosterone acetate, dihydrotestosterone butyrate, and dihydrotestosterone formate {{have been developed}} but have not been marketed.|$|E
25|$|Prasterone is {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} androgen in hormone replacement therapy (HRT) for menopause. In addition to prasterone itself, a long-lasting ester prodrug of prasterone, prasterone <b>enanthate,</b> is used in combination with estradiol valerate {{for the treatment of}} menopausal symptoms under the brand name Gynodian Depot.|$|E
25|$|The adverse {{side effects}} of {{injected}} testosterone esters are generally associated with high peak levels {{in the first few}} days after an injection. Some side effects may be ameliorated by using a shorter dosing interval (weekly or every ten days instead of twice monthly with testosterone <b>enanthate</b> or testosterone cypionate). 100mg weekly gives a much lower peak level of testosterone than does 200mg every two weeks, while still maintaining the same total dose of androgen. This benefit must be weighed against the discomfort and inconvenience of doubling the number of injections.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, testosterone <b>enanthate,</b> testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E
25|$|Norethisterone (NET), {{also known}} as norethindrone, is a {{medication}} that is used in combination with estrogen or alone in hormonal contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and {{in the treatment of}} gynecological disorders. It is a synthetic progestogen (or a progestin) of the 19-nortestosterone group and has similar effects to those of natural progesterone, including suppression of gonadotropins, ovulation inhibition, and endometrial transformation. In addition to its progestogenic activity, NET also has weak androgenic and estrogenic effects at high dosages. In addition to NET itself, several prodrugs of NET, such as norethisterone acetate (NETA), norethisterone <b>enanthate</b> (NETE), and others, have been marketed and have similar effects and uses.|$|E
25|$|A 1996 {{randomized}} controlled trial, which involved 43 men, {{did not find}} {{an increase in the}} occurrence of angry behavior during 10 weeks of administration of testosterone <b>enanthate</b> at 600mg/week, but this study screened out subjects that had previously abused steroids or had any psychiatric antecedents. A trial conducted in 2000 using testosterone cypionate at 600mg/week found that treatment significantly increased manic scores on the YMRS, and aggressive responses on several scales. The drug response was highly variable. However: 84% of subjects exhibited minimal psychiatric effects, 12% became mildly hypomanic, and 4% (2 subjects) became markedly hypomanic. The mechanism of these variable reactions could not be explained by demographic, psychological, laboratory, or physiological measures.|$|E
25|$|Testosterone can be {{administered}} parenterally, {{but it has}} more irregular prolonged absorption time and greater activity in muscle in <b>enanthate,</b> undecanoate, or cypionate ester form. These derivatives are hydrolyzed to release free testosterone {{at the site of}} injection; absorption rate (and thus injection schedule) varies among different esters, but medical injections are normally done anywhere between semi-weekly to once every 12 weeks. A more frequent schedule may be desirable in order to maintain a more constant level of hormone in the system. Injectable steroids are typically administered into the muscle, not into the vein, to avoid sudden changes in the amount of the drug in the bloodstream. In addition, because estered testosterone is dissolved in oil, intravenous injection has the potential to cause a dangerous embolism (clot) in the bloodstream.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, testosterone <b>enanthate,</b> and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E

2500|$|... 'Depot' drug {{formulations}} {{are created}} by mixing a substance with the drug that slows its release and prolongs {{the action of the}} drug. The two primarily used forms in the United States are the testosterone esters testosterone cypionate (Depo-Testosterone) and testosterone <b>enanthate</b> (Delatestryl) which are almost interchangeable. Testosterone <b>enanthate</b> is purported to be slightly better with respect to even testosterone release, but this is probably more of a concern for bodybuilders who use the drugs at higher doses (250–1000mg/week) than the replacement doses used by transgender men (50–100mg/week). These testosterone esters are mixed with different oils, so some individuals may tolerate one better than the other. Testosterone <b>enanthate</b> costs more than testosterone cypionate and is more typically the one prescribed for hypogonadal males in the United States. Testosterone cypionate is more popular in the United States than elsewhere (especially amongst bodybuilders). Other formulations exist but are more difficult to come by in the United States. A formulation of injected testosterone available in Europe and the United States, testosterone undecanoate (Nebido, Aveed) [...] provides significantly improved testosterone delivery with far less variation outside the eugonadal range than other formulations with injections required only four times yearly. However, each quarterly dose requires injection of 4mL of oil which may require multiple simultaneous injections. Testosterone undecanoate is also much more expensive as it is still under patent protection. Testosterone propionate is another testosterone ester that is widely available, including in the United States, Canada, and Europe, but it is very short-acting compared to the other testosterone esters and must be administered once every 2 or 3 days, and for this reason, is rarely used.|$|E

[...] Also known as methenolone or metenolone <b>enanthate,</b> {{it is the}} same steroid that Barry Bonds is alleged to have tested positive for in 2000 and 2001. [...] A fairly weak steroid on its own, it is generally used in conjunction with other steroids. [...] The drug is generally preferred in injected rather than oral form due to its cost. [...] An official statement by Major League Baseball made shortly after Rodriguez's test results became public expressed [...] "grave concern" [...] without naming Rodriguez, noting that [...] "because the survey testing that took place in 2003 was intended to be non-disciplinary and anonymous, we can not make any comment on the accuracy of this report as it pertains to the player named." ...|$|E
