The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a robust, accurate and generic algorithm to measure the individual static MLC leaf positions. This was performed by extracting leaf tip locations from the radiographic film image and measuring their relative distance from a reference line on the film. The reference line was created with a selected set of MLC leaf sides. The film scaling was created and verified using the physical leaf width. The average measured distance corresponds to a leaf width of 10  mm was 9. 95  ±  0. 09  mm. The <b>estimated</b> <b>reproducibility</b> of the leaf tips location was ± 0. 26  mm.

The algorithm includes two self testing functions in order to detect failures of leaf positioning due to poor film quality and to avoid the potential systematic errors attributable to the improper collimator setting.

40|$|The {{reproducibility}} of a biomarker plays a paramount role {{in determining}} whether it provides an accurate indication of the true underlying disease or risk status of an individual. When biomarker measurement involves obtaining samples of tissue at random from the organ of interest, sampling variability based on spatial effects can affect this reproducibility. This situation arises when a target organ, such as the prostate or esophagus, is evaluated by multiple random needle biopsies or when an excised organ is randomly sampled. We present a general approach toward <b>estimating</b> <b>reproducibility</b> {{in the presence of}} different variance-covariance structures needed to account for possible spatial or temporal variation and correlation. Specifically, we extend the work of previous authors involving applications of the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) by allowing for different variance-covariance structures of the data. A general concordance correlation matrix representing pairwise concordance correlation coefficients is presented along with an overall concordance correlation coefficient both of which may be obtained from models assuming different variance-covariance structures. The overall concordance correlation coefficient provides a measure of the overall reproducibility and its validity relative to various assumed covariance structures can be assessed by examining commonly employed goodness-of-fit measures.

However, <b>reproducibility</b> <b>estimates</b> for a single-grain measurement system analysing K-feldspar grains using the post-IR IRSL (pIRIR) signal do not exist. This study provides the first measurement <b>reproducibility</b> <b>estimates</b> for both the pIRIR 225 and pIRIR 290 protocol using an IR laser. It is found that holding a sample at elevated temperatures (e. g. 225 ?C or 290 ?C) prior to measurement leads to loss of the pIRIR signal. The default single grain procedure implemented by the Ris? reader may involve holding the sample at this elevated temperature for periods up to several hundreds of seconds, and that crucially this time may vary from one measurement to another, leading to poorer measurement reproducibility. The study demonstrates that the measurement procedure can be modified to standardise the time spent at high temperature (e. g. 290 ?C) and hence improve the reproducibility of the measurement system. The optimised procedure provides <b>reproducibility</b> <b>estimates</b> of 2. 8 ? 0. 3 % and 2. 6 ? 0. 3 % for the pIRIR 225 and pIRIR 290 signal, respectively, which are comparable to similar measurements performed with the green laser and the IR laser at 50 ?C. publishersversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
