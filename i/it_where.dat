5|$|As {{a result}} of Hurricane Katrina and the {{subsequent}} 2005 levee failures in Greater New Orleans, the congregation's building at 7000 Canal Boulevard filled with at least ten feet of water, and Beth Israel garnered national attention after {{attempts were made to}} save its Torah scrolls. Beth Israel's rabbi, Yisroel Shiff, who had evacuated to Tennessee before Katrina hit, contacted Rabbi Isaac Leider, who had worked on ZAKA search-and-rescue teams in Israel for five years. After contacting federal officials and the Louisiana National Guard, Leider hired a helicopter to fly him to within a mile of Beth Israel, met with the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) search-and-rescue team appointed to retrieve the scrolls. The group used rubber rafts to reach Beth Israel and enter <b>it,</b> <b>where</b> Leider waded into the sanctuary and rescued the Torah scrolls and their silver ornaments.|$|E

5|$|Fleming was {{not happy}} with the book, owing to the {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of <b>it</b> <b>where</b> he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights to Harry Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of the plots. However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based on one of the characters in the book.|$|E

France 2 and Enderlin issued a writ two days later.|$|E
