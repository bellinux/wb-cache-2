5|$|Another {{application}} of such chain conditions is in Noetherian induction—also known as well-founded induction—which is a generalization of mathematical induction. It frequently {{is used to}} reduce general statements about collections of objects to statements about specific objects in that collection. Suppose that S is a partially ordered set. One way of proving a statement about the objects of S is to assume {{the existence of a}} counterexample and deduce a contradiction, thereby proving the contrapositive of the original statement. The basic premise of Noetherian induction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> non-empty subset of S contains a minimal element. In particular, the set of all counterexamples contains a minimal element, the minimal counterexample. In order to prove the original statement, therefore, it suffices to prove something seemingly much weaker: For any counterexample, there is a smaller counterexample.|$|E
5|$|These {{decisions}} give {{support to}} a current mistaken {{view of the}} Constitution and the constitutional function of this court. This view, in short, <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> major social ill in this country can find its cure in some constitutional principle and that this court should {{take the lead in}} promoting reform when other branches of government fail to act. The Constitution is not a panacea for every blot upon the public welfare nor should this court, ordained as a judicial body, {{be thought of as a}} general haven of reform movements.|$|E
5|$|When {{a player}} {{moves to a}} tile {{occupied}} by a Cutie, that creature is slain along with any other Cuties of the same color directly connected to that tile. Chains of Cuties can be slain in this fashion, producing several souls. Each tile the player moves to is drained of life, causing the grass to wither and preventing the player from moving back to it, any Cuties destroyed in a chain outside of the initial tile become eggs. After a set period of turns the eggs hatch into random Cuties, which can again be harvested for souls. Any tiles drained by the player's presence return to life and are furnished with an egg when existing eggs hatch. The result of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> tile the reaper travels on takes twice as long to spawn a new Cutie compared to tiles that housed a Cutie destroyed by a chain attack. Players {{move to the next}} game level after a certain amount of moves, every new level increases the time taken for eggs to hatch by a turn. Moving onto a tile containing an egg destroys the egg and incurs a small point deduction, but destroying a golden egg increases the player's score. A golden egg is produced whenever 10 or more Cuties are killed in a chain.|$|E

A good example of the value of this is in BioModels Database, where every model is annotated and linked to relevant data resources such as publications, databases of compounds and pathways, controlled vocabularies, and more. With annotations, a model becomes more than simply a rendition of a mathematical construct—it becomes a semantically-enriched framework for communicating knowledge.|$|E

Indeed, in a case where there is near certainty that injury may be caused to the public interest if a person's rights of religious worship and freedom of expression would be realized, it is possible to limit the rights of the person in order to uphold the public interest.|$|E

This triangle can be constructed by first constructing a circle of diameter 1, and inscribing in it two of the angles of the triangle. The length of the sides of that triangle will be sin α, sin β and sin γ. The side whose length is sin α is opposite to the angle whose measure is α, etc.|$|E
25|$|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck (1744 - 1829) was {{the first}} {{biologist}} to describe a complex theory of evolution. His theory substantially comprised two statements: first, that animal organs and behaviour can change according {{to the way they}} are used; and second, that those characteristics can transmit {{from one generation to the}} next (the example of the giraffe whose neck becomes longer while trying to reach the upper leaves of a tree is well-known). The second statement <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> living organism, humans included, tends to reach a greater level of perfection. When Charles Darwin went to the Galápagos Islands, he was well aware of Lamarck's theories and was influenced by them.|$|E
25|$|During seed based {{restoration}} projects, it {{is generally}} recommended to source from local populations, to minimize the effects of maladaptation. One of the many challenges of restoration <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> species is different and requires different sourcing guidelines. Rather than putting strict distance recommendations, other guidelines recommend sourcing seeds to match similar environmental conditions. For example, sourcing for Castilleja levisecta found that farther source populations that matched similar environmental variables were better suited for the restoration project than closer source populations. Restoration guidelines vary drastically between states and agency. For example, Minnesota is broken up into 9 seed sourcing zones, where its neighbor Iowa, is broken into three latitudinal zones. US Forest Service recently developed provisional seed zones based {{on a combination of}} minimum winter temperature zones, aridity, and the Level III ecoregions.|$|E
