Both the formulation of 'recommendations' and criticisms by the EU and the 'responses' emanating from Slovakia, in terms of norms and policy, are examined, leading the author to conclude that the role of the EU in monitoring Slovakia's performance in protecting minority rights has suffered both from an unclear strategy and structural deficiencies, which have subsequently become embedded in Slovakia's domestic legal profile on minority issues...|$|R

40|$|The {{additionality}} principle {{says that}} the funds of the European Union should not replace, but be an addition to national regional policy funds. The benchmark for the co-funding is that the EU bears 50 % of total costs associated with regional projects eligible for EU support. In some regions, however, the <b>EU</b> <b>contribution</b> has reached 85 % of total costs. This study examines how such additionality degrees are determined. Our findings indicate that the regional variation of additionality degrees is largely in line with EU cohesion policy goals. Most notably, higher shares of EU funds are provided to regions with lower GDP per capita. Furthermore, while the share of service-sector employees in a region is negatively related to the additionality degree, {{the impact of the}} rate of long-term unemployment is positive. additionality, cohesion policy, EU regions, matching grant, growth and distribution...|$|E

40|$|External {{relations}} is currently {{among the most}} dynamic areas of EU law, its institutional structures profoundly affected by the Lisbon Treaty. This volume gathers leading analysts to assess core recent developments in the field, taking stock of the current law and potential developments in major policy areas. The volume opens with an assessment of a central concept {{at the heart of}} EU external relations, underpinning its international identity. Christophe Hillion analyses the legal principles which ensure coherence between different strands of the EU's external activity, and the contribution of law to the consistency of the EU's international presence. Frank Hoffmeister turns the focus outwards to the interaction between the EU and the international legal order - the legal basis for the EU's activity in shaping international law and the <b>EU's</b> <b>contribution</b> to 'state practice'. These opening chapters develop a picture of the EU's active international participation as well as the characteristic structural complexity of its external relations, and against this background the remainder of the book examines key policy areas of EU external action. Lorand Bartels analyses the relationship between trade policy and development; Markus Krajewski discusses trade in services and the link between external and internal policy issues; and Nathalie Tocci assesses the <b>EU's</b> <b>contribution</b> to conflict resolution, an important focus of the Common Foreign and Security Policy. The complex policy picture that emerges from the different goals, values and instruments across these areas is examined in the book's final chapter which focuses on the European Neighbourhood Policy, frequently proclaimed as a strategic priority for the EU. Together, the essays present a clear picture of the complex development of EU external relations, of the struggle for coherence in the increasingly active, visible and self-conscious role played by the EU as a participant in the international legal order...|$|R
