5|$|Arctic terns {{sometimes}} dip down to {{the surface}} of the water to catch prey close to the surface. They may also chase insects in the air when breeding. It is also thought that Arctic terns may, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> small size, occasionally engage in kleptoparasitism by swooping at birds so as to startle them into releasing their catches. Several species are targeted—conspecifics, other terns (like the common tern), and some auk and grebe species.|$|E
5|$|As {{they travel}} together, Natalie {{questions}} Ryan's philosophies on life, particularly on relationships and love, but Ryan is adamant {{that he is}} more than happy with his lifestyle. During the trip, Natalie is shattered when her boyfriend unceremoniously dumps her by text message, and Ryan and Alex try to comfort her. Natalie later lectures Ryan about his refusal to consider a commitment to Alex <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> obvious compatibility, and becomes infuriated; she apologizes later, but soon afterward they are both ordered back to Omaha to implement Natalie's program. On the test run, the earlier concerns Ryan raised prove valid; one laid-off person breaks down in tears before the camera, and Natalie is unable to comfort him.|$|E

They began operations using Serrate {{on the night}} of 14 June, and by 7 September had claimed 14 German fighters shot down, for 3 losses. The squadron was later handed to No. 100 Group RAF, who handled special operations within Bomber Command including jamming and similar efforts. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> successes, {{it was clear that the}} Beaufighter lacked the speed needed to catch the German aircraft, and Mosquitoes began to replace them late in 1943.|$|E
5|$|The Giants regressed to an 8–8 {{record in}} 2006. The season was {{characterized}} by inconsistent play, criticism of the coaching {{by the media and}} players, and Manning's struggles. They won five straight following a 1–2 start, giving them a two-game lead in the NFC East, but they lost six of their last seven games, and the players publicly clashed with Coughlin. One of the team's worst losses was a 24–21 defeat to Tennessee, in which the team surrendered a 21-point 4th-quarter lead. Following a season-ending win at Washington, the Giants made the playoffs as a wild card <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> record, but were defeated 23–20 by Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it.

Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E

5|$|Governor Violante Beatrice and the Dowager Electress, {{following}} the former's sojourn in Rome, <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mutual dislike of each other, attempted to ameliorate Gian Gastone's decadent public image together. Violante Beatrice organised banquets {{to remove him}} from the sway of the Ruspanti. His behaviour at these sent guests running for their carriages: he vomited into his napkin, wiped his mouth with his peri-wig and told rude jokes. These parties ceased when Violante Beatrice died, in 1731; Gian Gastone was devastated {{by the loss of}} his beloved sister-in-law. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died, as the public never saw him. To discredit these, the Dowager Electress induced Gian Gastone to make a public appearance—his final one—on Saint John the Baptist's day of 1729. An alcoholic, Gian Gastone drank too much before the ceremony and vomited repeatedly throughout; he had to be carried unconscious back to the Palazzo Pitti, the royal palace, on a litter. A sprained ankle incurred in July 1729 left the Grand Duke bed-ridden for—barring two occasions—the rest of his life.|$|E
5|$|Harrison had {{developed}} {{his foreign policy}} based largely on Blaine’s ideas, and {{at the start of}} his term, Harrison and Blaine had very similar views on the United States' place in the world. <b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> shared worldview, however, the two men became personally unfriendly as the term went on. Harrison was conscious that his Secretary of State was more popular than he, and while he admired Blaine’s gift for diplomacy, he grew displeased with Blaine’s frequent absence from his post because of illness, and suspected that Blaine was angling for the presidential nomination in 1892. Harrison tried to limit how many “Blaine men” filled subordinate positions in the State Department and denied Blaine’s request that his son, Walker, be appointed First Assistant Secretary, instead naming him Solicitor of the Department of State. Despite the growing personal rancor, the two men continued, with one exception, to agree on the foreign policy questions of the day.|$|E

5|$|However, retired Colonel Thomas H. Taylor, a {{military}} historian, contended in his 1996 book that <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> original purpose of short range infiltration, the Eighth Army Ranger Company was employed {{well for the}} missions they conducted, {{most of which were}} reactionary and borne out of a need to rapidly counter North Korean and Chinese attacks. Taylor noted that particularly in their earlier missions, the Rangers had been successful at operating as a night combat force, a skill {{that the rest of the}} U.S. forces in Korea were largely untrained in. Taylor also believed that the Rangers, who were drawn from replacement and occupation units in Japan, effectively gave the 25th Infantry Division an extra force it would not otherwise have possessed, allowing it to employ its conventional forces elsewhere. Taylor praised division commander Major General William B. Kean for his employment of the Rangers, and argued that the successes of the subsequent Ranger companies validated the existence of the Eighth Army Ranger Company.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mutual dislike, the Electress and Violante Beatrice {{attempted}} to improve Gian Gastone's poor public image together. Rumours abounded that the Grand Duke had died; {{it was a}} rarity {{for the public to}} see him. To dispel the said rumours, the Electress compelled him to make an appearance—his last one—in 1729, on the feast day of the patron saint of Florence, John the Baptist. The Ruspanti, Gian Gastone's morally corrupt entourage, hated the Electress; and she, them. Violante Beatrice tried to withdraw the Grand Duke from their sphere of influence by organising banquets. His conduct at these literally sent those in attendance scrambling for their carriages: he vomited repeatedly into his napkin, belched and told rude jokes. These distractions ceased upon Violante Beatrice's death in 1731.|$|E
5|$|On 31 August 1957, the British {{territory}} of Malaya received {{its independence from}} the Crown {{as a part of}} Britain's colonial withdrawal from the Far East, after nearly a decade of tortuous counter-insurgency warfare by British and Commonwealth troops against Malayan rebels in the Malayan Emergency. British plans dictated that the new state would be federated with the British colonies of Sarawak, Sabah, and Brunei in northern Borneo in order to better protect British military and economic interests in those regions. Brunei did not join, but Sarawak, Sabah, and Singapore had all agreed to join the new Federation by 1963. This project, labeled the 'Grand Design' by politician Malcolm MacDonald in the 1950s, became the cornerstone of British strategic thinking concerning Southeast Asia, and led to the initial federation of the numerous Malayan states <b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> multifarious differences, with Singapore and the Borneo states to join later. This plan also earned the support of the Malaysian government, which hoped to forestall claims from Indonesia on Borneo.|$|E

The Act—officially titled the Gesetz zur Behebung der Not von Volk und Reich ("Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich")—gave Hitler's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years. These laws could (with certain exceptions) deviate from the constitution. Since it would affect the constitution, the Enabling Act required a two-thirds majority to pass. Leaving nothing to chance, the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies (<b>in</b> <b>spite</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> virulent campaign against the party, the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending.|$|E
