5|$|Meanwhile, the James River Squadron {{had turned}} its {{attention}} to Minnesota, which had left Fort Monroe {{to join in the}} battle and had run aground. After Virginia had dealt with the surrender of Congress, she joined the James River Squadron despite her damage. Because of her <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> and the falling tide, however, Virginia was unable to get close enough to be effective, and darkness prevented the rest of the squadron from aiming their guns to any effect. The attack was therefore suspended. Virginia left with the expectation of returning the next day and completing the task. She retreated into the safety of Confederate-controlled waters off Sewell's Point for the night, but had killed 400 enemy sailors and had lost two. The Union had lost two ships and three were aground.|$|E
25|$|By Wednesday, September 7, 2005, safe {{drinking}} water was available in some West Bank areas, including Algiers and the Jefferson Parish suburbs, and some water pressure was available in New Orleans for fire fighting. All sewage from the city was flowing untreated into the Mississippi. The Lower Mississippi River was open during daylight hours to shallow draft traffic and <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> vessels less than 39 feet (12 m). A contractor removed obstacles in the Southwest Pass, which was restricting <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> navigation.|$|E
25|$|The Mississippi River Gulf Outlet {{was closed}} to <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> vessels. The inland portion was serving as an {{alternative}} route to the GIWW due to closure of the IHNC for shallow draft vessels. Preliminary surveys indicated a controlling depth of 27'.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{of their}} <b>deeper</b> <b>draft,</b> {{and the lower}} {{buoyancy}} of fresh water, salties may accept partial loads on the Great Lakes, [...] "topping off" [...] upon exiting the Seaway.|$|R
50|$|In {{concert with}} construction, the Sundini sound was deepened to 4 m (at mean water level) {{in order to}} allow ships with a <b>deeper</b> <b>draft.</b> The bridge's {{clearance}} is 17 m.|$|R
5000|$|Sail {{geometry}} {{has changed}} {{on a couple}} of occasions, most significantly in 1989 when the [...] "Racing Sail", still 75 ft² [...] "sail area", but with <b>deeper</b> <b>draft,</b> was made available as an option.|$|R
25|$|After the Confederate {{garrison}} at Norfolk was evacuated, Commodore Josiah Tattnall {{knew that}} CSS Virginia had no home port {{and he could}} not navigate her <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> through the shallow stretches of the James River toward Richmond, so she was scuttled on May 11 off Craney Island to prevent her capture. This opened the James River at Hampton Roads to Federal gunboats.|$|E
25|$|The world's first {{operational}} deep-water floating large-capacity {{wind turbine}} is the Hywind, in the North Sea off Norway. The Hywind was towed {{out to sea}} in early June 2009. The 2.3-megawatt turbine was constructed by Siemens Wind Power and mounted on a floating tower with a 100-metre <b>deep</b> <b>draft.</b> The float tower was constructed by Technip. Statoil says that floating wind turbines are still immature and commercialization is distant.|$|E
25|$|The {{falsework}} {{to perform}} this task {{is a pair}} of substantial truss bridges, prefabricated in segments, with columns and span segments lifted into place by barge cranes. The trusses are supported on foundations consisting of or built atop deeply driven piles. Upon completion of the bridge, the entire falsework structure and all exposed underwater supports will be removed to make a safe channel for <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> ships transiting to and from the Port of Oakland.|$|E
50|$|Canals are not {{the only}} draft-limited {{shipping}} lanes. A Malaccamax ship has the <b>deepest</b> <b>draft</b> able to transit the very busy but relatively shallow Strait of Malacca. There are only a few ships of this size.|$|R
50|$|An error {{during the}} {{construction}} of Reina María Luisa meant that she was given a larger keel than described in the plans, resulting in a slightly <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> in the stern and shallower in the bow.|$|R
5000|$|The Wakatake-class destroyers were {{essentially}} slightly modified [...] ships with a <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling. Weaponry layout, general arrangement and silhouette were all identical with the Momi class.|$|R
25|$|Canberra was {{withdrawn}} from P service in September 1997 {{and sold to}} ship breakers for scrapping on 10 October 1997, leaving for Gadani ship-breaking yard, Pakistan on 31 October 1997. Her <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> meant {{that she could not}} be beached as far as most ships, and due to her solid construction the scrapping process took nearly a year instead of the estimated three months, being totally scrapped by the end of 1998.|$|E
25|$|Bouchard {{met with}} his {{officers}} to design the attack plan. Sir Peter Corney knew the bay from two previous visits to Monterey. They used the corvette Santa Rosa to attack since the <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> frigate La Argentina might run aground. The frigate had to be towed by small boats and {{out of range of}} the Spanish artillery. Once it was out of range, Bouchard sent captain Sheppard to the Santa Rosa, leading two hundred soldiers, carrying firearms and lances.|$|E
25|$|She {{began her}} maiden voyage to Miami that same year, amidst {{speculation}} about her {{future in the}} cruise industry. The France had been built as an ocean liner: for speed; long, narrow, with a <b>deep</b> <b>draft,</b> {{as well as an}} array of cabin shapes and sizes designed in a compact manner more for purpose travel than languid cruising. But the Norway proved popular, and made the notion of the ship being a destination in itself credible. Her size, passenger capacity, and amenities revolutionized the cruise industry and started a building frenzy as competitors began to order larger ships.|$|E
50|$|The Wakatake-class destroyers were {{essentially}} slightly modified Momi-class ships with a <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> to improve handling characteristics in heavy seas, particularly against rolling. Weaponry layout (with {{the exception of}} added AA armaments), general arrangement and silhouette were all identical with the Momi class.|$|R
50|$|The Port {{has its own}} {{fleet of}} tugs and pilots. Mundra Port also owns a fleet of {{dredgers}} {{to carry out the}} capital and maintenance dredging activities and thereby ensuring that Mundra Port has the <b>deepest</b> <b>draft</b> amongst all ports in India.|$|R
40|$|To {{assess the}} {{navigability}} of <b>deep</b> <b>drafted</b> vessels in muddy navigation areas {{a mathematical model}} has been built {{that takes into account}} the characteristics of the mud layer. This was achieved with the introduction of a fluidization parameter which determines the corresponding hydrodynamically equivalent depth above a solid bottom. As a result, the under keel clearance dependency of a given mathematical manoeuvring model can be reformulated in such way that the effect of any realistic muddy condition is included. In this article the modelling of the propeller and rudder induced forces and the implementation possibilities of the model will be discussed. It is concluded that the mathematical model, initially formulated for a 6, 000 TEU container carrier, provides reliable predictions of the behaviour of larger container carriers and even fuller <b>deep</b> <b>drafted</b> ships...|$|R
25|$|Although Wäinämöinen was an {{invaluable}} {{addition to the}} Finnish icebreaker fleet, she was not used as extensively as the smaller state-owned icebreakers due to her high fuel consumption and the shortage of coal shortly after the war. In addition to icebreaker duties {{she was used to}} transport volunteers across the Gulf of Finland to participate in the Estonian War of Independence. In September 1919 she was drydocked in Suomenlinna, but while the repair work was completed in late October, she could not leave the shipyard until 24 November due to her <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> and the particularly low sea level. During the particularly harsh winter of 1922 she assisted 170 ships to and from the Finnish ports. Her last task under the Finnish flag was to open the South Harbour in Helsinki on 16 April 1922.|$|E
500|$|Roanokes <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> {{prevented}} {{her from}} engaging the Confederate casemate ironclad CSS Virginia (her former sister [...] ) during the Battle of Hampton Roads on 8–9 March 1862.

5000|$|... “Goose Creek” A {{tributary}} of the Cooper River {{was the site of}} a U.S. Navy submarine base through the late 90’s and functioned as a nuclear weapons handling facility servicing FBM (Fleet Ballistic Submarines) until the advent of the larger Trident Submarine-Launched Ballistic Missile which drove the Ohio-class submarine to require a <b>deeper</b> <b>draft.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Villanueva {{applied for}} the 2003 PBA draft, {{in one of the}} <b>deepest</b> <b>drafts</b> in PBA history. He was {{eventually}} selected seventh overall by Batang Red Bull Thunder. In his rookie season, he averaged modest numbers of 7.4 points and 4.5 rebounds playing a limited role as a reliever of veterans Davonn Harp and Mick Pennisi.|$|R
50|$|The {{existing}} port was substantially {{built in}} the late 1950s and is reaching {{the end of its}} useful life. Beginning in 2017, the Port of Anchorage is undertaking an extensive 7-year Anchorage Port Modernization Project to upgrade its aging infrastructure, support larger <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> vessels, and future proof the port seismically and environmentally for another 75 years.|$|R

500|$|General Admiral was a {{very large}} screw frigate {{designed}} by Captain 1st Rank Ivan Shestakov and named after General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia, commander of the Russian Navy. She was built of live oak, but was reinforced with diagonal and longitudinal iron braces. General Admiral displaced [...] She was [...] long between perpendiculars, had a beam of [...] and a <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> of [...] She was sheathed in copper to reduce biofouling. A novel system of zinc pipes that penetrated sheathing and connected with the ventilation fan was installed in the hold to prevent the decay of her hull. Its efficacy is unknown although General Admirals short life suggests {{that it was not}} effective.|$|E
50|$|The IJgeul or IJ trench is a {{man-made}} excavation {{on the bottom}} of the North Sea, off the coast of IJmuiden, which provides access to large vessels with <b>deep</b> <b>drafts</b> to the port of IJmuiden, and also via the North Sea Canal, to the port of Amsterdam (just like the Eurogeul for the port of Rotterdam).|$|R
50|$|High-speed boats such {{as those}} shown here had a special {{advantage}} in some operations in the free-running Yangtze. In several locations within the Three Gorges, one-way travel was enforced through fast narrows. While less maneuverable and <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> vessels were obliged to wait for clearance, these high-speed boats were free to zip past waiting traffic by running in the shallows.|$|R
50|$|The 1990 National Hockey League Entry Draft was the 28th NHL Entry Draft. It was {{hosted by}} the Vancouver Canucks at BC Place in Vancouver, British Columbia, on June 16, 1990. It is remembered {{as one of the}} <b>deeper</b> <b>drafts</b> in NHL history, with 14 of the 21 first round picks going on to careers of at least 500 games.|$|R
500|$|Shortly after Kirov was {{launched}} in 1936, the two Project 26bis ships were laid down. They incorporated a number of changes from the first batch, not {{least of which was}} that they were larger. They displaced [...] at standard load and [...] at full load. They were only slightly longer at [...] overall and had a <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> of [...] at full load. On trials they proved to be the fastest ships of the class with a speed of [...] Their armament was much the same as the earlier ships, although nine [...] 61-K anti-aircraft guns were mounted rather than the six on the first pair and they were fitted to carry 150 Model 1908/39 mines in place of the Model 1912 mines.|$|E
500|$|USS Roanoke was a wooden-hulled [...] screw frigate {{built for}} the United States Navy in the mid-1850s. She served as {{flagship}} of the Home Squadron in the late 1850s and captured several Confederate ships {{after the start of}} the American Civil War in 1861. The ship was converted into an ironclad monitor during 1862–63; the first ship with more than two gun turrets in history. Her conversion was not very successful as she rolled excessively and the weight of her armor and turrets strained her hull. Her <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> meant that she could not operate off shallow Confederate ports and she was relegated to harbor defense at Hampton Roads, Virginia {{for the duration of the}} war. Roanoke was placed reserve after the war and sold for scrap in 1883.|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the engagement, Worden {{directed}} Williams {{to steer}} Monitor around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where Lieutenant Wood fired his 7-inch Brooke gun at the vessel's pilothouse, striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural [...] "iron log" [...] along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was peering out. Worden was heard to have cried out, My eyes—I am blind! Others in the pilothouse had also been hit with fragments and were also bleeding. Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion and believing the pilothouse to be severely damaged, Worden ordered Williams to sheer off into shallow water, where Virginia with her <b>deep</b> <b>draft</b> could not follow. There Monitor drifted idly for about twenty minutes. At the time the pilothouse was struck Worden's injury was only known to those in the pilothouse and immediately nearby. With Worden severely wounded, command passed to the Executive Officer, Samuel Greene. Taken by surprise and confused he hesitated briefly and was undecided as to what action to take next, but after assessing the damage soon ordered Monitor to return to the battle area.|$|E
5000|$|Ships in {{this class}} are bulk carriers, usually {{transporting}} coal, ore and other commodity raw materials. The term capesize is not applied to tankers. The average size of a capesize bulker is around , although larger ships (normally dedicated to ore transportation) have been built, up to [...] The large dimensions and <b>deep</b> <b>drafts</b> of such vessels mean that only the largest deep-water terminals can accommodate them.|$|R
500|$|The {{installation}} of ship locks {{is intended to}} increase river shipping from tenmillion to 100million tonnes annually, as a result transportation costs will be cut between 30 and 37%. Shipping will become safer, since the gorges are notoriously dangerous to navigate. Ships with much <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> {{will be able to}} navigate [...] upstream from Shanghai all the way to Chongqing. It is expected that shipping to Chongqing will increase fivefold.|$|R
50|$|In the mid-1830s, canals {{offered the}} cheapest, most {{practical}} means of transportation. The Sangamon River was too shallow in many spots for <b>deeper</b> <b>draft</b> steamers {{that would be}} required to carry goods and produce to market. There were several proposals for solving the river's transportation problem with private financing. As a state legislator from the area, Lincoln pushed for incorporation of a company to undertake the canal project.|$|R
