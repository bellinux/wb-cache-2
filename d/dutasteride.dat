25|$|<b>Dutasteride</b> is a {{medication}} {{in the same}} class as finasteride but inhibits both type I and type II 5-alpha reductase. <b>Dutasteride</b> is approved for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss in Korea and Japan, but not in the United States. However, it is commonly used off-label to treat male-pattern hair loss.|$|E
25|$|In {{those who}} are being {{regularly}} screened, 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor (finasteride and <b>dutasteride)</b> reduce the overall risk of being diagnosed with prostate cancer; however, there is insufficient data {{to determine if they}} {{have an effect on the}} risk of death and may increase the chance of more serious cases.|$|E
25|$|Certain antiandrogens do {{not reduce}} {{testosterone}} or prevent its action upon tissues, but instead prevent its metabolite, dihydrotestosterone (DHT), from forming. These medications {{can be used}} when the patient has male-pattern hair loss and/or an enlarged prostate (benign prostatic hyperplasia), both of which DHT exacerbates. Two medications are currently available to prevent the creation of DHT: finasteride and <b>dutasteride.</b> DHT levels can be lowered up to 60–75% with the former, and up to 93–94% with the latter. These medications have also {{been found to be}} effective in the treatment of hirsutism in women.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} notable drug {{interactions}} with progesterone. Certain selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) such as fluoxetine, paroxetine, and sertraline {{may increase the}} GABAA receptor-related central depressant effects of progesterone by enhancing its conversion into 5α-dihydroprogesterone and allopregnanolone via activation of 3α-HSD. Progesterone potentiates the sedative effects of benzodiazepines and alcohol. Notably, there is a case report of progesterone abuse alone with very high doses. 5α-Reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and <b>dutasteride,</b> as well as inhibitors of 3α-HSD such as medroxyprogesterone acetate, inhibit the conversion of progesterone into its inhibitory neurosteroid metabolites, and for this reason, may {{have the potential to}} block or reduce its sedative effects.|$|E
25|$|Antiandrogens, {{including}} spironolactone, cyproterone acetate, flutamide, bicalutamide, and finasteride, {{can be used}} {{to reduce}} or eliminate unwanted body hair, such as in the treatment of hirsutism. Although effective for reducing body hair, antiandrogens have little effect on facial hair. However, slight effectiveness may be observed, such as some reduction in density/coverage and slower growth. Antiandrogens will also prevent further development of facial hair, despite only minimally affecting that which is already there. With the exception of 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and <b>dutasteride,</b> antiandrogens are contraindicated in men due to the risk of feminizing side effects such as gynecomastia as well as other adverse reactions (e.g., infertility), and are generally only used in women for cosmetic/hair-reduction purposes.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs with}} anti-androgen effects include flutamide, and spironolactone, which can give some {{improvement}} in hirsutism. Metformin can reduce hirsutism, perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, {{and is often}} used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes, or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. Eflornithine (Vaniqa) is a drug that {{is applied to the}} skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride and <b>dutasteride)</b> may also be used; they work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the latter of which responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).|$|E
25|$|The 5α-reductase inhibitors {{finasteride}} and <b>dutasteride</b> {{may also}} be used in men with BPH. These medications inhibit the 5α-reductase enzyme, which, in turn, inhibits production of DHT, a hormone responsible for enlarging the prostate. Effects may take longer to appear than alpha blockers, but they persist for many years. When used together with alpha blockers, no benefit was reported in short-term trials, but in a longer term study (3–4 years) there was a greater reduction in BPH progression to acute urinary retention and surgery than with either agent alone, especially in patients were more severe symptoms and larger prostates. Other trials have confirmed reductions in symptoms, within 6 months in one trial, an effect that was maintained after withdrawal of the alpha blocker. Side effects include decreased libido and ejaculatory or erectile dysfunction. The 5α-reductase inhibitors are contraindicated in pregnant women because of their teratogenicity due to interference with fetal testosterone metabolism, and as a precaution, pregnant women should not handle crushed or broken tablets.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase {{plays an}} {{important}} role in the metabolism of NET, and 5α-reductase inhibitors such as finasteride and <b>dutasteride</b> can inhibit its metabolism. The ethynyl group on the carbon 17 of NET is preserved in approximately 90% of all of its metabolites, this is due to the steric hindrance at that carbon.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors like {{finasteride}} and <b>dutasteride</b> {{can be used}} to slow {{or prevent}} androgenic alopecia (pattern hair loss) and various other adverse androgenic symptoms (e.g., acne) in transgender men taking testosterone. However, they may also slow or reduce certain aspects of masculinization, such as facial and body hair growth and clitoral enlargement. A potential solution is to start taking a 5α-reductase inhibitor after these desired aspects of masculinization have been established.|$|E
2500|$|Donors are {{screened}} for health risks {{that could make}} the donation unsafe for the recipient. [...] Some of these restrictions are controversial, such as restricting donations from MSM (men {{who have sex with}} men) for HIV risk. In 2011, the UK (excluding Northern Ireland) reduced its blanket ban on MSM donors to a narrower restriction which only prevents MSM from donating blood if they have had sex with other men within the past year. A similar change was made in the U.S. in late 2015 by the FDA. [...] Autologous donors are not always {{screened for}} recipient safety problems since the donor is the only person who will receive the blood. Since the donated blood may be given to pregnant women or a women of child-bearing age, donors taking teratogenic (birth defect causing) medications are deferred. These medications include acitretin, etretinate, isotretinoin, finasteride and <b>dutasteride.</b>|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors are overall well-tolerated {{and show}} a low {{incidence}} of adverse effects. Sexual dysfunction, including erectile dysfunction, loss of libido, and reduced ejaculate volume, may occur in 3.4 to 15.8% of men treated with finasteride or <b>dutasteride.</b> A small {{increase in the}} risk of affective symptoms including depression, anxiety, and self-harm may be seen. Both the sexual dysfunction and affective symptoms may be due partially or fully to prevention of the synthesis of neurosteroids like allopregnanolone rather necessarily than due to inhibition of DHT production. A very small risk of gynecomastia has been associated with 5α-reductase inhibitors (1.2 to 3.5%). Based on reports of 5α-reductase type II deficiency in males and the effectiveness of 5α-reductase inhibitors for hirsutism in women, reduced body and/or facial hair growth is a likely potential side effect of these drugs in men. There are very few studies evaluating the side effects of 5α-reductase inhibitors in women. However, due to the known role of DHT in male sexual differentiation, 5α-reductase inhibitors may cause birth defects such as ambiguous genitalia in the male fetuses of pregnant women. As such, they are not used in women during pregnancy.|$|E
2500|$|... 5α-Reductase inhibitors like {{finasteride}} and <b>dutasteride</b> inhibit 5α-reductase type II and/or other isoforms and {{are able}} to decrease circulating DHT levels by 65 to 98% depending on the 5α-reductase inhibitor in question. As such, similarly to the case of 5α-reductase type II deficiency, they provide useful insights in the elucidation of the biological functions of DHT. 5α-Reductase inhibitors were developed and are used primarily for the treatment of BPH. The drugs are able to significantly reduce the size of the prostate gland and to alleviate symptoms of the condition. Long-term treatment with 5α-reductase inhibitors is also able to significantly reduce the overall risk of prostate cancer, although a simultaneous small increase in the risk of certain high-grade tumors has been observed. In addition to prostate diseases, 5α-reductase inhibitors have subsequently been developed and introduced for the treatment of pattern hair loss in men. They are able to prevent further progression of hair loss in most men with the condition and to produce some recovery of hair in about two-thirds of men. 5α-Reductase inhibitors seem to be less effective for pattern hair loss in women on the other hand, although they do still show some effectiveness. Aside from pattern hair loss, the drugs may be useful in the treatment of other DHT-dependent skin and hair conditions including acne, seborrhea, and hirsutism as well.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dutasteride</b> has an {{extremely}} long terminal half-life of 4 or 5 weeks. For this reason, it takes months for <b>dutasteride</b> {{to be eliminated}} from the body after discontinuation. In contrast to <b>dutasteride,</b> the terminal half-life of finasteride is short, at only 6 to 8 hours.|$|E
50|$|Children, {{women who}} are or who may become pregnant, and people with known {{significant}} hypersensitivity (e.g., serious skin reactions, angioedema) to <b>dutasteride</b> or finasteride should not take <b>dutasteride.</b> Exposure to <b>dutasteride</b> and other 5α-reductase inhibitors during pregnancy can cause birth defects. Since these medications are readily absorbed through the skin, {{women who are}} or may become pregnant should not handle them and if they {{come into contact with}} leaking capsules, the contact area should be washed immediately in soapy water. People taking <b>dutasteride</b> should not donate blood and, due to its long half-life, should also not donate blood for at least 6 months after the cessation of treatment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dutasteride</b> {{inhibits}} 5α-reductase isoenzymes type 1 and 2 {{better than}} finasteride, {{leading to a}} more complete reduction in DHT at 24 weeks (94.7% versus 70.8%). It also reduces intraprostatic DHT 97% in men with prostate cancer at 5 mg/day over three months. A second study with 3.5 mg/day for 4 months decreased intraprostatic DHT even further by 99%. The suppression of DHT in vivo, and the report that <b>dutasteride</b> inhibits 5α-R3 in vitro suggest that <b>dutasteride</b> may be a triple 5α reductase inhibitor.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dutasteride</b> was {{patented}} in 1996 and {{was first}} {{described in the}} scientific literature in 1997. It {{was approved by the}} FDA for the treatment of BPH in November 2001 and was introduced into the U.S. market the following year under the brand name Avodart. <b>Dutasteride</b> has subsequently been introduced in many other countries as well, including throughout Europe and South America. The patent protection of <b>dutasteride</b> expired in November 2015 and the drug has since become available in the U.S. in a variety of low-cost generic formulations.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dutasteride</b> has overall {{been found}} to be well-tolerated in studies of both men and women, {{producing}} minimal side effects. Important potential side effects of <b>dutasteride</b> in a minority of patients may include sexual dysfunction and depression. Other general side effects include headache and gastrointestinal discomfort. Isolated reports of menstrual changes, acne, and dizziness also exist. There is a very small risk of gynecomastia (breast enlargement) in men. In pregnant women, <b>dutasteride</b> can cause birth defects in male fetuses, namely ambiguous genitalia, and for this reason, should never be given to them.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dutasteride</b> is a {{medication}} {{in the same}} class as finasteride but inhibits both type I and type II 5-alpha reductase. <b>Dutasteride</b> is approved for the treatment of male-pattern hair loss in Korea and Japan, but not in the United States.

It has been found in several studies to improve hair growth in men more rapidly and {{to a greater extent than}} 2.5 mg/day finasteride. <b>Dutasteride</b> has also been used off-label in the treatment of female pattern hair loss.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} dutasteride/tamsulosin hydrochloride (trade names Jalyn, Combodart, and Duodart) is {{a prescription}} pharmaceutical produced by GlaxoSmithKline {{for the treatment}} of adult male symptomatic benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH).It is a combination of two previously existing drugs: Tamsulosin Hydrochloride, trade name Flomax, and <b>Dutasteride,</b> trade name Avodart. It contains 0.4 mg of Tamsulosin Hydrochloride and 0.5 mg of <b>Dutasteride.</b>|$|E
50|$|The FDA {{has added}} a warning to <b>dutasteride</b> about an {{increased}} risk of high-grade prostate cancer. While the potential for positive, negative or neutral changes to the potential risk of developing prostate cancer with <b>dutasteride</b> has not been established, evidence has suggested it may temporarily reduce the growth and prevalence of benign prostate tumors, but could also mask the early detection of prostate cancer. The primary area for concern is for patients who may develop prostate cancer whilst taking <b>dutasteride</b> for benign prostatic hyperplasia, which in turn could delay diagnosis and early treatment of the prostate cancer, thereby potentially increasing the risk of these patients developing high-grade prostate cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The {{results of}} the CombAT (combination of <b>dutasteride</b> and {{tamsulosin}} under the brand name Duodart) trial in 2008 demonstrated that treatment with the combination of <b>dutasteride</b> (Avodart) and tamsulosin provides greater symptom benefits compared to monotherapy with either agent alone for treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia.The CombAT trial became the medication Jalyn. It {{was approved by the}} FDA on 14 June 2010. [...] This combination can be useful as it can take up to six months for any symptomatic relief to be found by 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors such as <b>dutasteride</b> compared to alpha-1 receptor blockers which can provide relief in some cases within 48 hours.|$|E

50|$|In {{addition}} to inhibition of DHT production, 5α-reductase inhibitors like <b>dutasteride</b> are also neurosteroidogenesis inhibitors, preventing the 5α-reductase-mediated biosynthesis of various neurosteroids including allopregnanolone, , and 3α-androstanediol. These neurosteroids are potent positive allosteric modulators of the GABAA receptor {{and have been}} found to possess antidepressant, anxiolytic, and pro-sexual effects in animal research.
