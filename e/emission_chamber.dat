40|$|Emissions of (semi-) {{volatile}} organic compounds ((S) VOCs) from materials can adversely impact indoor and in-vehicle air quality. National and international regulations/protocols, such as the European Construction Products Directive, German protocol for fire-resistant floorings (AgBB) [1] and the Californian CHPS protocol for public school building programs (CHPS) [2] require the determination of materials emissions using conventional test equipment such as chambers/cells (Methods EN 13419 - 1 /- 2 /- 3, ISO/EN 16000 - 6 /- 9 /- 10 /- 11, ASTM D 5116 - 97, ASTM 1) 7143 - 05 etc).

Manure handling scheme used was reflective of commercial manure-belt house operation. Four dynamic <b>emission</b> <b>chambers</b> and measurement system was developed, featuring continuous measurement of the following variables for each chamber: (a) NH 3 concentrations of inlet and outlet air, (b) air temperature and relative humidity, (c) airflow rate, (d) feeder weight and thus feeding activity, and (e) manure pan weight and thus defecation activity. Daily feed consumption of the hens averaged 103 g/hen-d and fresh manure production averaged 125 g/hen-d. Ammonia emission rate ranged from 1. 26 mg/hen-hr {{on the first day}} of manure accumulation to 9. 26 mg/hen-hr after 7 d of manure accumulation. CO 2 emission rate averaged 3. 41 and 2. 47 g/hen-hr during light and dark hours of the day, respectively.

Results from this study will contribute to the development and/or validation of process-based farm emission model for predicting NH 3 emissions from laying-hen houses.

40|$|In {{addition}} to thermal comfort air quality {{is an important}} factor which affects well-being, satisfaction and often the health of the users indoors. An important part of air quality is the perceived air quality, using a human panel and their noses as the measurement-instrument. Perceived air quality is focused on the olfactory impact of odor-relevant emissions, emitted from various sources indoors on the users. This work investigates the relationship among the olfactory measurement categories of the perceived air quality: acceptance, hedonic tone, perceived intensity, unreasonableness, percentage dissatisfied-value (PD-value) and odor-descriptors. It pursues the goal to develop a model that allows the evaluation of acceptance and/or PD-value from perceived intensity in consideration of the hedonic tone assessed by a small panel group. At first, the book explains the theory of perceived air quality estimation and gives a brief overview about air quality guidelines and standards (chapter 2). The air-quality assessment methods and the evaluation procedures used for the experimental investigations of this work are explained in chapter 3. The first section of experiments with a human panel (chapter 4) includes investigations with single-component chemical reference substances (reproducible basic odors). In {{addition to}} those experiments, some combinations of two basic odors are performed. Additionally, the impact of relative air humidity on acceptance and perceived intensity is investigated. The second part of experiments (chapter 5) deals with complex odor mixtures that are found in building products which are investigated in <b>emission</b> <b>chambers.</b> Building constructions usually consist of different materials and do therefore constitute a large set of possible material combinations. The olfactory perception of odors from building products investigated in <b>emission</b> <b>chambers</b> might therefore be different to that of building products found in real rooms. Experiments are performed in order to determine such differences (chapter 6). Chapter 7 shows the comparison of results of single substances with the odor mixtures from building products. Additionally, two models for the relationship among perceived intensity, hedonic tone and acceptance will be presented. The first model is used for basic odors the second one for odor mixtures (building products). These models enable the evaluation of acceptance/PD-value from perceived intensity and hedonic tone assessed by a small panel group. Finally, the odor-mixtures model is tested with input data that have not been used before (section 7. 3 in chapter 7). It is shown that the odor-mixture model is able to determine the expected acceptance range for building products from a given perceived intensity and hedonic tone. However, this model is only partly suitable for applications in room air quality investigations. This model will need adaptation if the investigated air sample includes additional odors from humans, furnishings or foodstuff...|$|R

These vapors can originate from either volatilization of contaminates from shallow contaminated groundwater and transport into residences or from sources within the residence. The focus of the thesis was the development of a testing strategy for determining sources of TCE, 1, 2 DCA, and PCE in the indoor air of residences near Hill AFB. Eight residences were selected for this study by Hill AFB based on prior detections of TCE, 1, 2 DCA, and PCE in indoor air. Residents were asked to turn off the heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) system and keep windows and doors closed for at least 3 hours prior to the sampling visit to reduce mixing of residence air. Indoor air samples were collected on Tenax© sorbent tubes from various locations within the residences to determine the location of the potential source(s). Sampling tubes were analyzed by thermal desorption gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Results from a tracer experiment using sulfur hexafluoride gas confirmed the effectiveness of sampling approach. In cases where elevated levels of {{chlorinated solvents}} were found, the suspected source materials(s) were removed and the room air was re-sampled. If removal of the materials reduced or eliminated indoor air contamination, an <b>emission</b> <b>chamber</b> was used to determine contaminant emission from the materials.

However, spraying a high dose of AEW may generate high levels of ammonia (NH 3) due to an increase in litter moisture content (LMC). Lab-scale experiments were conducted to assess the effect of AEW spray dosage and pH on PM and NH 3 emissions from the litter of aviary hen houses. Four dynamic <b>emission</b> <b>chambers</b> (DECs) located in an environmentally controlled room were used for the evaluation.

40|$|Formaldehyde {{has been}} one of the most widely and most {{controversially}} debated substances in indoor spaces. Its classification as a human carcinogen by the International Agency for Research on Cancer in 2004 and the EU in 2015 has given rise to further studies into possible indoor emission sources. It is known that the utilization of formaldehyde-containing chemicals in textiles is widespread. As a result, the question arises as to whether, and to what extent, textiles can contribute to contamination of indoor air with formaldehyde. However, there is hardly any information available on this subject, as the formaldehyde content in textiles is generally determined through extraction procedures.
