5|$|Worms Armageddon {{includes}} {{a very high}} level of customizability – in multiplayer games or skirmishes, the player can create custom game modes with preferred gameplay options and weapon sets. Regular options include starting health, whether the worms can move, how long a turn lasts, and sudden death options. Weapons settings include what weapons the teams start with, which weapons will fall in crates and how often, and <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> individual weapons are. Worms Armageddon offers several levels of customizability outside of direct gameplay options.|$|E
5|$|The {{world of}} Human Revolution was {{designed}} to parallel the Greek myth of Icarus; in the myth, Icarus was flying with artificial wings, but flew {{too close to the}} sun and destroyed his wings, causing his fatal fall. The world's new reliance on and experimentation with augmentation technology mirrored the myth, with the game's narrative taking place at a crucial tipping point, the outcome of which would be decided by the player. The general focus on technology and its effect on human society also tied into the game's visual themes. The development team used multiple sources as references while creating the world and scenario. The Children of Men was used to capture the setting and resultant chaotic drama, Bioshock gave them a reference for the handling of mature themes, while the television series Rome showed <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> people's ambitions shaped history. The sense of tension between augmented and normal humans was inspired by the similar tension between humans and mutants in the X-Men franchise. For the conspiracy elements of the plot, the team used novels Deception Point, The Firm, and Frank Herbert's Dune saga as inspiration. The desired quality of cutscenes and dialogue were directly inspired by the Grand Theft Auto and Mass Effect franchises. DeMarle termed the final product as a study in contrasts, as the implementation of augmentation technology had created a new form of divided social class system when other social barriers had fallen. Other themes used earlier in Deus Ex, such as exploring a culture of fear; the workings of a surveillance state; and the exploitation created by economic inequality, were paralleled in Human Revolution. To add more depth to the world and narrative, the team created supplementary written material such as emails, e-books, and cell phone-like devices called pocket secretaries.|$|E

Finally, Al-Rodhan argues that all states, no matter <b>how</b> <b>powerful,</b> must be bound by international law and its obligations.|$|E

25|$|Although {{the game}} is free to play, it {{supports}} in-app purchases, where players can purchase additional Poké Balls and other in-game items. These items include incense (which attract Pokémon to you as you move for thirty minutes), lure modules, to attract Pokémon to a fixed location, and lucky eggs, which double experience points gained for a thirty-minute period from use. All Pokémon are displayed with a combat power. A Pokémon's combat power is a rough measure of <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> that Pokémon is in battle.

25|$|Jung {{emphasized}} the importance of balance and harmony. He cautioned that modern humans rely too heavily on science and logic and would benefit from integrating spirituality and appreciation of the unconscious realm. His work not only triggered analytical work by art historians, but it became an integral part of art-making. Jackson Pollock, for example, famously created a series of drawings to accompany his psychoanalytic sessions with his Jungian psychoanalyst, Dr. Joseph Henderson. Henderson who later published the drawings in a text devoted to Pollock's sessions realized <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> the drawings were as a therapeutic tool.|$|E
25|$|Yet in his research, McDonough {{also notes}} that Meyer's female {{characters}} were limited in <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> they could appear; often the female lead is raped (Up! and Lorna) or brutally murdered (Beyond the Valley of the Dolls, Supervixens, Lorna and Blacksnake). While Russ Meyer may have championed powerful woman characters, he also forced them into violent and terrifying situations, making them prove their physical and mental strength against tremendous odds. He also ensured that women's breasts were at least semi-exposed during these ordeals for comic or erotic effect. Furthermore, according to frequent collaborator and longtime lover Kitten Natividad, Meyer's love of dominant women extended to his personal life, and he was almost always in a tumultuous relationship.|$|E

25|$|West {{grew up in}} a home {{filled with}} discussions of world affairs. Her father was a {{journalist}} who often involved himself in controversial issues. He brought home Russian revolutionaries and other political activists, and their debates helped to form West's sensibility, which took shape in novels such as The Birds Fall Down, set in pre-revolution Russia. But the crucial event that molded West's politics was the Dreyfus affair. The impressionable Rebecca learned early on just <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> was the will to persecute minorities and to subject individuals to unreasonable suspicion based on flimsy evidence and mass frenzy. West had a keen understanding of the psychology of politics, how movements and causes could sustain themselves on the profound need to believe or disbelieve in a core of values—even when that core contradicted reality.|$|E
25|$|Although Margaret of Anjou had {{now taken}} the place {{formerly}} held by Suffolk or Somerset, her position, {{at least at}} first, was not as dominant. York had his Lieutenancy of Ireland renewed, and he continued to attend meetings of the Council. However, in August 1456 the court moved to Coventry, {{in the heart of}} the queen's lands. How York was treated now depended on <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> the queen's views were. York was regarded with suspicion on three fronts: he threatened the succession of the young Prince of Wales; he was apparently negotiating for the marriage of his eldest son Edward into the Burgundian ruling family; and as a supporter of the Nevilles, he was contributing to the major cause of disturbance in the kingdom – the Percy-Neville feud.|$|E
25|$|A grieving Anita {{arrives at}} Maria's apartment. As Tony leaves, he tells Maria {{to meet him}} at Doc's so they can run away to the country. In spite of her {{attempts}} to conceal it, Anita sees that Tony has been with Maria, and launches an angry tirade against him ("A Boy Like That"). Maria counters by telling Anita <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> love is ("I Have a Love"), and Anita realizes that Maria loves Tony as much as she had loved Bernardo. She admits that Chino has a gun and is looking for Tony. Lt. Schrank arrives to question Maria about her brother's death, and Anita agrees to go to Doc's to tell Tony to wait. Unfortunately, the Jets, who have found Tony, have congregated at Doc's, and they taunt Anita with racist slurs and eventually simulate rape. Doc arrives and stops them.

500|$|The {{rehearsal}} {{process is}} really understated. It's funny because it's not really needed. It's not needed for us anyway. Because {{we know how}} to play the songs, and the [...] charts don't change the songs structurally at all. But the symphony charts are something that you're not used to hearing. And then the symphony doesn't need the rehearsal because they sight-read. They sight-read better than we could even imagine. So when we get there, they already know how to play our songs better than we do... The purpose of the rehearsal is really, honestly to prepare the band for exactly <b>how</b> <b>powerful</b> the concert is going to be. When the symphony jumps in during those moments where all of a sudden you're singing a song you sing every night and then 30 more musicians start playing, it's so powerful that it causes you to take pause, and you can't take pause. And that's what the rehearsal really is for.|$|E
