The two ageing Boeing 737-200 (delivered new to the airline in 1970), which had {{an average age of}} 36.7 years, were {{scrapped}} in 2006 and replaced by more modern Boeing 737-300. The airline then replaced its four Boeing 767-300ER and one Boeing 767-200ER with a Boeing 777-200ER. The middle-age 777, though, was replaced with two Airbus A340-300 wet-leased from Air France from March 2012 till 2018 when a replacement aircraft is required (the wet leases have since been converted to one <b>damp</b> <b>lease</b> and one sublease of an operating lease) ...|$|E

50|$|AV8 Air was {{an airline}} {{based in the}} United Kingdom. It was {{established}} in June 2003 and started operations on 25 November 2003. It was launched as a subsidiary of tour operator CT2 and began operations on 7 April 2004 with a long-haul flight to Cape Town using a Boeing 767-300ER aircraft. The company operated the 767 on a <b>damp</b> <b>lease</b> basis from Icelandair until their own Air Operator's Certificate (AOC) was granted from the UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). Unfortunately, {{due to a lack}} of a bond, the AOC was revoked. A Boeing 757-200 aircraft was intended for use on short-haul flights to Mediterranean resorts, but due to the unsuccessful AOC application, the aircraft was only operated on a weekly check flight around Manchester. The airline ceased trading after only five months.|$|E
