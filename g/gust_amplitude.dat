40|$|A {{statistical}} {{wind profile}} gust {{model for the}} Space Transportation Operations and Trade Studies is developed by using 1800 Jimsphere wind profile data collected at Cape Kennedy during 1965 to 1972. Wind profiles from the surface to 20 km in component form, i. e., zonal and meridional are processed through the digital filters of different wave length ranges bases on the Martin-Graham cosine rolloff model. The residuals obtained from the filtering processes for the data base for the statistical analysis. For each wind component the gust and gust length at a specified reference altitude in a residual profile are defined. A two parameter gamma probability marginal distribution seems to fit the component <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> and the gust length when redefined. The problem of finding an appropriate bivariate joint distribution of the <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> and length remains to be solved. The probability distribution of the modulus of the gust amplitudes was derived {{under the assumption that}} they are independently distributed as gamma variates...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} model and analyze the coupled nonlinear flight dynamics and aeroelasticity of highly flexible flyingwings. A low-order nonlinear strain-based finite element framework is used, which is capable of capturing the fundamental impact of geometrically nonlinear effects in a computationally effective formulation target for preliminary vehicle design and control evaluation. A simple model to capture {{the change in the}} wing torsional stiffness due to skin wrinkling arising from large bending curvatures is proposed. Finite-state unsteady subsonic aerodynamics with simplified stall models are incorporated to complete the aeroelastic representation of flyingwings. In studying theflyingwingdynamic response, a spatially and temporally distributed discrete gustmodel is introduced. With the proposed formulations, numerical studies are conducted based on a representative highly flexible flying wing subjected to finite disturbances.

40|$|In this paper, {{aerodynamic}} gust {{responses are}} presented which are calculated using the DLM-correction method iSKEM [1]. iSKEM uses quasi-steady CFD data {{in order to}} enhance the DLM-based results. Comparisons between DLM, CFD and iSKEM for a rigid 3 D swept wing show that the steady-state properties of the flowfield, such as separation and recompression-shocks, should always be taken into account. Quasi-steady corrections are only sufficient in the linear range of the steady lift polar and only for small <b>gust</b> <b>amplitudes.</b> In case of high angles of attack, i. e. with flow separation, steady corrections are not sufficient. Moreover, for high <b>gust</b> <b>amplitudes</b> even at low angles of attack linear methods {{will not be able to}} calculate the actually occurring load peaks...|$|R

The results of the correction method are compared to uncorrected doublet-lattice results, and to results obtained from a nonlinear computational fluid dynamics solver, the DLR TAU-Code. The correction method agrees well with time-marching results obtained by TAU {{in the limit of}} dynamically linear <b>gust</b> <b>amplitudes</b> and improves with gust length.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of gust response problems {{is a crucial}} and, if high accuracy is desired, time consuming task. Since linear frequency domain methods have previously shown significant reduction in computational cost for motion-induced aerodynamics, an extension towards gust excitation is proposed. Time-domain signals are reconstructed by a superposition of responses at several discrete frequencies. Once frequency domain solutions are available, a reduced order model is constructed projecting the linearised Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations on a combined modal basis. While eigenmodes are accurate in predicting structural vibration, additional modes from proper orthogonal decomposition capture aerodynamic effects due to gust excitation. For all methods a two-dimensional NACA 0012 aerofoil is investigated at sub- and transonic conditions. Limitations of the linearised approach are first outlined by increasing the <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> at both operating points. Subsequently, a worst case gust length search is performed and it is shown that the computational cost is reduced case dependent by several orders of magnitude compared to the original system...|$|E
40|$|Calculations {{are made}} of the {{approximate}} hazard due to peak normal accelerations of an airplane flying through a simulated vertical wind field associated with a convective frontal system. The calculations {{are based on a}} hazard metric developed from a systematic application of a generic math model to 1 -cosine discrete gusts of various amplitudes and gust lengths. The math model simulates the three degree-of- freedom longitudinal rigid body motion to vertical gusts and includes (1) fuselage flexibility, (2) the lag in the downwash from the wing to the tail, (3) gradual lift effects, (4) a simplified autopilot, and (5) motion of an unrestrained passenger in the rear cabin. Airplane and passenger response contours are calculated for a matrix of gust amplitudes and gust lengths. The airplane response contours are used to develop an approximate hazard metric of peak normal accelerations as a function of <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> and gust length. The hazard metric is then applied to a two-dimensional simulated vertical wind field of a convective frontal system. The variations of the hazard metric with gust length and airplane heading are demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Dynamic load due to gust for {{helicopter}} rotors directly {{affects the}} structural stress and flight performance. In case of gust, it may cause {{the loss of}} trust force or the increase of deflection for rotors. In current work, an effective coupled aeroelastic model based on a medium-deflection beam theory and a nonlinear unsteady aerodynamic model in the time domain were constructed. Three types of gust in vertical direction were added in the model. The dynamic response and structural load for helicopter rotors under three types of gust were calculated, respectively. Results indicated that when rotors suffer a gust in hover at downward direction, the thrust force on rotor disk would decrease significantly when the <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> increases, which should be paid attention in the design. Among the three gust types with the same gust strength, the maximum instantaneous shear force due to impulse shape gust is the largest. When the rotors suffer a gust in a forward flight, the shear force {{at the root of}} rotors would increase with the gust strength first but then it decreases. More attention should be paid to the decrease of thrust force and the increase of structural load in a forward flight...|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} the TNO gust {{analysis}} method {{and the resulting}} TNO gust model are described. The method {{has been applied to}} a set of 700 hours of stationary wind speed time series measured at the meteorological mast at Cabauw, The Netherlands. The results are discussed in this paper. The TNO gust model has been developed for the calculation of wind turbine loads, especially fatigue loads. To model gusts an analysis method has been developed to statistically analyze full-scale wind speed data and translate these to discrete gusts. The main result of the TNO gust model is that finally, all <b>gust</b> <b>amplitudes</b> are described by one single expression being a function of the height, the mean wind speed, the turbulence intensity, the gust duration and the probability exceedance level within an error band of less than 5 %. The model also gives a relation between the gust duration and the frequency of occurence of the gusts. The TNO gust model has been incorporated in the Dutch Handbook 'Wind Data for Wind Turbine Design'. Verification of this handbook has been performed by comparing the flap and lag loads on the blade root of three different wind turbines by means of the Handbook with the loads measured. The comparison showed very good agreement especially in the range 10 2 to 10 8 load fluctuations per year. © 1992...|$|R
40|$|A unified autoregressive (AR) {{model is}} identified, {{based on the}} wind tunnel test data of {{open-loop}} gust response for an aircraft model. The identified AR model {{can be adapted to}} various flow velocities in the wind tunnel test. Due to the lack of discrete gust input measurement, a second-order polynomial function is used to approximate the <b>gust</b> input <b>amplitude</b> by flow velocity. Afterwards, with the identified online aeroelastic model, the modified generalized predictive control (GPC) theory is applied to alleviate wing tip acceleration induced by sinusoidal gust. Finally, the alleviation effects of gust response at different flow velocities are estimated based on the comparison of simulated closed-loop acceleration with experimental open-loop one. The comparison indicates that, after gust response alleviation, the wing tip acceleration can be reduced up to 20 % at the tested velocities ranging from 12 [*]m/s to 24 [*]m/s. Demonstratively, the unified control law can be adapted to varying wind tunnel velocities and gust frequencies. It {{does not need to be}} altered at different test conditions, which will save the idle time...|$|R
40|$|We present wind data {{collected}} {{for ten days}} {{during the dry season}} in 2008 during the Murici II Campaign, which was carried out {{in the area of the}} Centro de Lançamento de Alcântara (CLA). The main goals are to better understand processes governing the wind regime in the CLA and the development of tools for analyzing the impact of wind on rocket structure and on the dispersion of pollutants released during the launch. A set of 11 aerovanes (ten at 10 -m height and one at 1. 5 -m height) plus a sonic anemometer at 1. 5 -m height were deployed to measure wind speed and direction, which were stored as ten-minute data. Turbulence intensity, gust factor, and <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> were computed from the available dataset. Statistical analysis shows that the wind direction is predominant from East-Northeast (ENE), with the mean vector wind direction of 60 o, in agreement with the trade wind regime. The diurnal cycle of all statistical properties of the wind are strongly marked. Wind speed, turbulence intensity, and gusts are peaked at about 1000 LST. The presence of a non-diurnal cycle of four days has been noticed and might be associated with synoptic systems acting on the region. A simple heuristic formula was proposed to compute Lagrangian time-scale from Eulerian time-scale, and from which we compute the Lagragian standard deviation, a final product to be used as input in diffusion models...|$|E
40|$|This {{problem is}} aimed at testing the ability of {{computational}} aeroacoustic methods to calculate the acoustic pressure field generated {{as a result of}} the interaction of a convected harmonic gust with a rectilinear cascade of swept flat plates. All relevant geometric information is the same as the unsteady response of an isolated finite span swept airfoil to an incident gust problem with the exception of the sweep angle alpha, which is now taken to be a variable. Assume a cascade stagger angle of zero (with the x-axis aligned with the chord) and a gap-to-chord ratio of h/c = 1. The mean flow Mach number M(sub 0), gust frequency omega, <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude</b> A, and chordwise wavenumber k(sub x) are the same. But for the cascade problem take k(sub y) = pi and k(sub z) = 0. The appropriate physical scales are also the same, as is the governing equation and boundary conditions. Naturally, the impermeability condition now applies to the entire cascade. For this problem, determine the amplitude of upstream-radiated rms acoustic pressure as a function of the sweep angle at the specified frequency. Specifically, show the variations of rms acoustic pressure amplitude at the upstream location (- 5 c, 0, l/ 2) for sweep angle alpha in the range (0. 0 deg, 30. 0 deg). Use sweep angle increments no larger than 2. 5 deg. Express the results in dB using the rms pressure value for alpha = 0. 0 deg as the reference level. The appropriate FORTRAN output statement should read "WRITE(IUNIT,*) alpha, 20 -log 10 (p(sub rms) (alpha) /p(sub rms) (0)) "...|$|E
40|$|For an {{efficient}} Wind Power Plants Reliability Estimation, the extreme gusts {{are the most}} important features of wind speed statistics, in order to quantify the destruction brought about by extreme winds. With the purpose of characterizing these destructive wind forces, which are random in nature, an appropriate stochastic model is adopted in the paper. Such model is based upon the probabilistic modeling of gusts occurrence by means of a Poisson Process, while the amplitude of extreme gust wind speeds is modeled by means of suitable extreme value distributions. This approach yields an appropriate ???safety function??? of the structure, which is defined as the probability that the stochastic process: ???largest extreme <b>gust</b> <b>amplitude???</b> is smaller than a given threshold value, in a given time interval. Such safety function can be easily converted into a ???safety horizon??? (SH), i. e. a time interval in which the WGA smaller than a given threshold value z, with a given high probability value p. If z is chosen as the maximum value of the WGA that the structure can resist, then the SH is {{an efficient}} measure (i. e., an opportune quantile) of the time to failure of the structure. In the paper, attention is focused on the estimation of the above SH by means of a suitable Bayesian estimation technique, which is based upon prior (or "a priori") information which should be easily available and not difficult to implement. This may be accomplished by means of analytical or numerical techniques, as shown in the paper. Finally, the summary of a large set of numerical simulations is presented, which show the high efficiency of such Bayesian estimation methodology. In particular, its superiority with respect to the "classical" Maximum Likelihood (ML) estimation methods, traditionally adopted in power system applications, is illustrated. A remark on the robustness of the proposed procedure, with respect to the choice of prior pdf, is also outlined- - in the conclusions...|$|E
40|$|Micro air {{vehicles}} (MAVs) {{have the}} potential to perform mission critical tasks not suitable for large aircrafts. To fulfill their potential, MAVs should be capable to maintain stable flight under different and even the most severe flight conditions. Due to their low inertia and low flight speed, MAVs are susceptible to wind gust during flight. It was observed that a flapping wing is more gust resistant than a traditional fixed wing. In this paper we numerically study the aerodynamic performance of a flapping airfoil in various gusty conditions by solving the Navier-Stokes equations. An algebraic moving grid technique is used to handle the dynamic airfoil motion. The effects of <b>gust</b> fluctuation <b>amplitude,</b> ratio of the flapping frequency to the gust frequency, airfoil kinematics are investigated.

In their direct application to Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) ROMs seek {{to reduce the}} computational complexity of a problem by {{reducing the number of}} degrees of freedom rather than simplifying the physical model. Here, parametric nonlinear ROMs based on high-fidelity CFD are used to provide approximate flow solutions, but at lower evaluation time and storage than the original CFD model. ROMs for both steady and unsteady aerodynamic applications are presented. We consider ROMs combining proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and Isomap, which is a manifold learning method, with interpolation methods as well as physics-based ROMs, where an approximate solution is found in the POD-subspace by minimizing the corresponding steady or unsteady flow-solver residual. In terms of the nonlinear unsteady least-squares ROM algorithm, we present the details of an improved accelerated greedy missing point estimation procedure which is usedin the onl�ine phase to select a subset of the unsteady residual for reasons of computational effi�ciency during the online prediction phase. The issue of how to best train the ROM with high-fidelity CFD data is also addressed. The goal is to train ROMs that yield a large domain of validity across all parameters and flow conditions at the expense of {{a relatively small number of}} CFD solutions. The different ROM methods are demonstrated on a wide-body transport aircraft configuration at transonic flow conditions. The steady ROMs are used to predict the static aeroelastic loads in the context of multidisciplinary optimization (MDO), where a structural model is to be sized for the (aerodynamic) loads. They are also used in a process where an a priori identification of the most critical static load cases is of interest and the sheer number of load cases to be considered does not lend itself to high-�fidelity CFD.
