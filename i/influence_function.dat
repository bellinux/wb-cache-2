40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{illustrate}} {{the usefulness of}} <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> for studying properties of various statistical estimators of mean rain rate using space-borne radar data. In Martin (1999), estimators using censoring, minimum chi-square, and least squares are compared in terms of asymptotic variance. Here, we use <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> to consider robustness properties of the same estimators. We also obtain formulas for the asymptotic variance of the estimators using <b>influence</b> <b>functions,</b> and thus show that {{they may also be}} used for studying relative efficiency. The least squares estimator, although less efficient, is shown to be more robust {{in the sense that it}} has the smallest gross-error sensitivity. In some cases, <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> associated with the estimators reveal counterintuitive behaviour. For example, observations that are less than the mean rain rate may increase the estimated mean. The additional information gleaned from <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> may be used to understand better and improve the estimation procedures themselves. ...|$|R

In this paper, we use <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> [...] a classic technique from robust statistics [...] to trace a model's prediction through the learning algorithm and back to its training data, thereby identifying training points most responsible for a given prediction. To scale up <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> to modern machine learning settings, we develop a simple, efficient implementation that requires only oracle access to gradients and Hessian-vector products. We show that even on non-convex and non-differentiable models where the theory breaks down, approximations to <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> can still provide valuable information. On linear models and convolutional neural networks, we demonstrate that <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> are useful for multiple purposes: understanding model behavior, debugging models, detecting dataset errors, and even creating visually-indistinguishable training-set attacks.

40|$|The {{coefficient}} of variation is a well-known measure used in many fields to compare the variability of a variable in several populations. However, when the dimension is greater than one, comparing the variability only marginally may lead to controversial results. Several multivariate extensions of the univariate {{coefficient of}} variation have been introduced in the literature. In practice, these coefficients can be estimated by using any pair of location and covariance estimators. However, {{as soon as the}} classical mean and covariance matrix are under consideration, the <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> are unbounded, while the use of any robust estimators yields bounded <b>influence</b> <b>functions.</b> While useful in their own right, the <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> of the multivariate coefficients of variation are further exploited in this talk to derive a general expression for the corresponding asymptotic variances under elliptical symmetry.

(2004), Tchetgen et al. (2006), Robins et al. (2007)). Higher order <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> are higher order U-statistics. Our theory extends the first order semiparametric theory of Bickel et al. (1993) and van der Vaart (1991) by incorporating the theory of higher order scores considered by Pfanzagl (1990), Small and McLeish (1994) and Lindsay and Waterman (1996). The theory reproduces many previous results, produces new non-âˆš(n) results, and opens up the ability to perform optimal non-âˆš(n) inference in complex high dimensional models. We present novel rate-optimal point and interval estimators for various functionals of central importance to biostatistics in settings in which estimation at the expected âˆš(n) rate is not possible, owing to the curse of dimensionality. We also show that our higher order <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> have a multi-robustness property that extends the double robustness property of first order <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> described by Robins and Rotnitzky (2001) and van der Laan and Robins (2003).

The basics of the spatial filtration theory, having the wide field of application are described for the remote-sensing problem.

In statistics, classical estimation methods rely heavily on assumptions which are often not met in practice. In particular, it is often assumed that the data errors are normally distributed, at least approximately, or that the central limit theorem can be relied on to produce normally distributed estimates. Unfortunately, when there are outliers in the data, classical estimators often have very poor performance, when judged using the breakdown point and the <b>influence</b> <b>function,</b> described below.|$|E

Incomplete observations are a major concern as most (online and real-world) social networks are not fully observable. We establish both proper and improper PAC learnability of <b>influence</b> <b>functions</b> under randomly missing observations. Proper PAC learnability under the Discrete-Time Linear Threshold (DLT) and Discrete-Time Independent Cascade (DIC) models is established by reducing incomplete observations to complete observations in a modified graph. Our improper PAC learnability result applies for the DLT and DIC models {{as well as the}} Continuous-Time Independent Cascade (CIC) model. It is based on a parametrization in terms of reachability features, and also gives rise to an efficient and practical heuristic. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the ability of our method to compensate even for a fairly large fraction of missing observations.
