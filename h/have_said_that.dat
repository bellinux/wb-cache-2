5|$|Bill C-10 (previously Bill C-33), among a {{long list}} of minor changes to tax law {{contained}} a controversial clause that would give the government power to deny taxation benefits for films made in Canada if the government deems the content to be objectionable. David Cronenberg and Sarah Polley argued it is equivalent to censorship because most Canadian films cannot afford to be produced without government assistance. The Bill was passed in the House October 29, 2007, but opposition parties later said that they did not notice the controversial part and several Senators <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they intend to send the Bill back to the House.|$|E
5|$|Following Suter's {{return from}} suspension, NHL Senior Vice President Brian Burke was {{supposed}} by Ducks Head Coach Pierre Pagé to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{he would have}} given Suter a longer ban if the extent of Kariya's injuries were immediately known. Later in the season, prior to a game between the Blackhawks and Maple Leafs in April 1998, Suter received a death threat, presumably for his actions against Kariya, forcing the NHL to position added security at the Blackhawks bench for the contest. With Kariya away from the team for extended periods of time, the Ducks struggled and finished second-last in the West.|$|E

5|$|In early November 2008, the President of Iceland, Ólafur Ragnar Grímsson, at an {{informal}} lunch with foreign diplomats, criticized Iceland's traditional friends (particularly Britain, Sweden and Denmark) {{as well as}} the International Monetary Fund. According to a memo from the Norwegian embassy, he suggested that the Russians might want to use the Keflavík Air Base, the Russian ambassador replied that they had no need for it. The President is quoted to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Iceland would soon recover, even if they had to fight alone. The President does not necessarily agree with the government on these issues.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{have liked}} finding contradictions; a common complaint, however, is the games' linearity, {{as well as}} how the player {{sometimes}} has to resort to a trial-and-error method due to the games only accepting specific pieces of evidence, and how testimony statements sometimes need to be pressed in a specific order. Some reviewers have criticized the lack of changes to the gameplay and presentation throughout the series, while some <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> fans of the series would not have a problem with this.|$|E
5|$|The {{son of a}} furrier, Mühe {{was born}} on 20 June 1953 in Grimma, Saxony, in the German Democratic Republic (East Germany).

He was relieved of duty after contracting stomach ulcers; a number of commentators <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{this was due to}} stress, and also suggested that it marked the beginnings of the stomach cancer that would eventually lead to his death.|$|E

5|$|Cochrane {{argues that}} nonhuman animals {{do not possess}} an {{intrinsic}} interest in freedom. Therefore, owning or using nonhuman animals is not, in itself, unjust. This aspect of his thought has generated responses by others, including the political theorist Robert Garner and the philosopher John Hadley, who argue {{that there may be}} reasons to claim that nonhuman animals do possess an interest in freedom. Cochrane has also proposed a cosmopolitan alternative to Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's picture of a political animal rights, explicated in their 2011 book Zoopolis. Though Donaldson and Kymlicka have defended their account against Cochrane's criticism, they <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they welcome attempts to develop alternative political theories of animal rights to their own. Cochrane's other research focusses variously on bioethics, punishment, just war and human rights.|$|E
5|$|Crass <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> {{their musical}} {{influences}} were seldom drawn from rock, but more from classical music (particularly Benjamin Britten, on whose work, Rimbaud states, some of Crass' riffs are based), free jazz, European atonality and avant-garde composers such as John Cage and Karlheinz Stockhausen. Crass influenced the anarchist {{movement in the}} UK, the US and beyond. The growth of anarcho-punk spurred interest in anarchist ideas. The band have also claimed credit for revitalising the peace movement and the UK Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament during the late 1970s and early 1980s. Others contend that they overestimated their influence, their radicalising effect on militants notwithstanding. Crass' philosophical and aesthetic influences on 1980s punk bands were far-reaching, although few mimicked their later free-form style (heard on Yes Sir, I Will and their final recording, Ten Notes on a Summer's Day). Their painted and collage black-and-white record sleeves (by Gee Vaucher) may have influenced later artists such as Banksy (with whom Vaucher collaborated) and the subvertising movement. Anti-folk artist Jeffrey Lewis's 2007 album, 12 Crass Songs, features acoustic covers of Crass material.|$|E

5|$|From the 1963 season, Brabham was partnered by American driver Dan Gurney, {{the pair}} now running in Australia's racing colours {{of green and}} gold. Brabham took the team's first win at the non-championship Solitude Grand Prix in 1963. Gurney took the marque's first two wins in the world championship, at the 1964 French and Mexican Grands Prix. Brabham works and {{customer}} cars took another three non-championship wins during the 1964 season. The 1965 season was less successful, with no championship wins. Brabham finished third or fourth in the Constructors' Championship for three years running, but poor reliability marred promising performances on several occasions. Motor sport authors Mike Lawrence and David Hodges <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> a lack of resources may have cost the team results, a view echoed by Tauranac.|$|E
5|$|In {{analyzing}} {{the creation of}} the Polish Legions, many historians have argued that Napoleon used the Poles as a source of recruits and had little desire to invest in the re-creation of the Polish state. Among the most notable of Napoleon's contemporary Polish detractors was Kościuszko, who refused to join the Legions, arguing that Napoleon would not restore Poland in any durable form. In this regard, Kościuszko also stated that the Duchy of Warsaw was created in 1807 only because it was expedient, rather than because Napoleon supported Polish sovereignty. Nevertheless, the memory of Napoleon's Polish Legions is strong in Poland, and Napoleon himself is often regarded as a hero and liberator there. About the Polish Legion, Napoleon himself is reputed to <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> 800 Poles would equal 8,000 enemy soldiers.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} since Jock Stein's death, some, {{including}} Alex Ferguson, <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they noticed changes in him {{in the days and}} weeks prior to the game against Wales. The night before, Stein had invited Ferguson and Andy Roxburgh to his hotel room, where he reminisced with them about his time in football, something that he rarely if ever did; he also persuaded his family not to make the trip to Cardiff to watch the game. Further, Ferguson noted that, during the half-time interval, Stein did not dominate the dressing room in the way he normally did, while Gordon Strachan found it difficult to understand precisely what Stein was saying during his team-talk. However, Strachan came to accept that the final decision Stein made, to replace him with Davie Cooper, was the correct one given Cooper's subsequent impact on the game.|$|E

5|$|On May 19, 2007, Harisu and Jung {{were married}} at Central City Millennium Hall in the Seocho-gu {{district}} of Seoul. The ceremony was {{presided over by}} KBS anchor Shin Young-il, and officiated by Kim Suk-kwon, a Dong-A University professor who had performed Harisu's sex change surgery in the 1990s. The couple honeymooned on the Thai island of Ko Samui, and began their married life at Harisu's family home in Nonhyun-dong, in the Gangnam-gu district of Seoul. The couple <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they plan to adopt four children, though the news prompted a mixed public reaction. A poll by Mnet found that 69% of 1,300 respondents were in favour of Harisu's decision to adopt, while in a similar poll by Daum, 58% of 8,094 respondents were against the idea. Harisu and Jung divorced in 2017 after ten years of marriage.|$|E
5|$|Religious {{debates over}} the Harry Potter series of books by J. K. Rowling are based on claims that the novels contain occult or Satanic subtexts. A number of Protestant, Catholic, and Orthodox Christians have argued against the series, as have some Shia and Sunni Muslims. Supporters of the series <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the magic in Harry Potter bears little {{resemblance}} to occultism, being more in the vein of fairy tales such as Cinderella and Snow White, or to the works of C. S. Lewis and J. R. R. Tolkien, {{both of whom are}} known for writing fantasy novels with Christian subtexts. Far from promoting a particular religion, some argue, the Harry Potter novels {{go out of their way}} to avoid discussing religion at all. However, the author of the series, J. K. Rowling, describes herself as a practising Christian, and many have noted the Christian references which she includes in the final novel Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows.|$|E
5|$|Sotomayor's {{circuit court}} rulings {{led to her}} being {{considered}} a political centrist by the ABA Journal and other sources and organizations. Several lawyers, legal experts, and news organizations identified her as someone with liberal inclinations. In any case, the Second Circuit's caseload typically skewed more toward business and securities law rather than hot-button social or constitutional issues. Sotomayor tended to write narrow, practiced rulings that relied on close application of the law to the facts of a case rather than import general philosophical viewpoints. A Congressional Research Service analysis found that Sotomayor's rulings defied easy ideological categorization, but did show an adherence to precedent and an avoidance of overstepping the circuit court's judicial role. Unusually, Sotomayor read through all the supporting documents of cases under review; her lengthy rulings explored every aspect of a case and tended to feature leaden, ungainly prose. Some legal experts <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> Sotomayor's attention to detail and re-examination of the facts of a case came close to overstepping the traditional role of appellate judges.|$|E

5|$|Starship Troopers {{brought to}} an end Heinlein's series of {{juvenile}} novels. It became one of his best-selling books, and is considered his most widely known work. It won the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 1960, and garnered praise from reviewers for its scenes of training and combat and its visualization of a future military. It also became enormously controversial because of the political views it seemed to support. Reviewers were strongly critical of the book's intentional glorification of the military, an aspect described as propaganda and likened to recruitment. The ideology of militarism {{and the fact that}} only military veterans had the right to vote in the novel's fictional society led to it being frequently described as fascist. This description is disputed, some commentators arguing that Heinlein was only exploring the idea of limiting the right to vote to a certain group of people. Heinlein's depiction of gender has also been questioned, while reviewers <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> the terms used to describe the aliens were akin to racial epithets.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} {{commissioned}} by Sveriges Radio Radioteatern, the radio drama department of Sweden's national radio broadcaster. First released in the Swedish broadcast version in August 2009, with an English-language version following in November 2009, it features a cast of Swedish and American actors {{and a variety of}} musical styles ranging from opera to vaudeville and pop. The album's recording was a collaborative effort – while the music and English vocals were recorded by Sparks in the United States, the album's Swedish vocals were recorded by Sveriges Radio in Stockholm, and then sent to the Maels via an FTP server. The album and its ambitious dramatic concept received favourable reviews, and the Mael brothers <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> they are planning both a live show and a film version of the musical.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers <b>have</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the key that the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
