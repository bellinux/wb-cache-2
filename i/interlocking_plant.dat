50|$|There is {{a single}} island {{platform}} between the two tracks, which are designated as Tracks A3 and A4, and end at bumper blocks {{just north of the}} platform at Chaining Station 1541+00. To the immediate south is an <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Plant</b> made up of a diamond crossover that allows trains to get to the correct track, and then proceed to share the right of way with the 207th Street Yard leads to Dyckman Street, which is the next station south. This station terminal has been refurbished with two ADA-accessible elevators added. The mezzanine and street elevator shaft includes artwork titled At the Start...At Long Last by Sheila LaBrettville. The terminal is operated by a Dispatcher's Office at the south end, while the <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Plant</b> is controlled by the CTC located in the 207th Street Yard.|$|E
50|$|While {{the tracks}} and <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> at this {{location}} are signalized to alert locomotive engineers when the interlocking switches are set for through track train movement, the switches are not designed to de-rail a locomotive or train that runs through them when they are aligned for through track train movement.|$|E
50|$|Around 2:00 p.m. on January 23, 2005, a fire {{destroyed}} the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> at Chambers Street. As a result, {{two of three}} A trains were canceled or rerouted, and all C service was completely suspended. Some newspaper articles have blamed the fire on a homeless person trying to keep warm, {{but that was not}} confirmed.|$|E
50|$|In {{mechanical}} <b>interlocking</b> <b>plants,</b> a locking bed is constructed, {{consisting of}} steel bars forming a grid. The levers that operate switches, derails, signals or other appliances {{are connected to}} the bars running in one direction. The bars are constructed so that if the function controlled by a given lever conflicts with that controlled by another lever, mechanical interference is set up in the cross locking between the two bars, in turn preventing the conflicting lever movement from being made.|$|R
5000|$|Below {{is a list}} {{of several}} snap pea cultivars {{currently}} available, ordered by days to maturity. Days to maturity is from germination to edible pod stage; add about 7 days to estimate shell pea stage. Amish Snap is the only true heirloom snap pea. PMR indicates some degree of powdery mildew resistance; afila types, also called semi-leafless, maintain an erect, <b>interlocked,</b> <b>plant</b> habit that allows good air movement through the canopy and reduces risk from lodging and mold ...|$|R
50|$|The inventors of the hydro-pneumatic system {{moved forward}} to an {{electro-pneumatic}} system in 1891 and this system, best {{identified with the}} Union Switch & Signal Company, was first installed on the Chicago and Northern Pacific Railroad at its drawbridge across the Chicago River. By 1900, 54 electro-pneumatic <b>interlocking</b> <b>plants,</b> controlling a total of 1,864 interlocking levers, were in use on 13 North American railroads. This type of system would remain one of two viable competing systems into the future, although it did have the disadvantage of needing extra single-use equipment and requiring high maintenance.|$|R
50|$|In railway signalling, an {{interlocking}} is {{an arrangement}} of signal apparatus that prevents conflicting movements through {{an arrangement of}} tracks such as junctions or crossings. The signalling appliances and tracks are sometimes collectively referred to as an <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant.</b> An interlocking is designed {{so that it is}} impossible to display a signal to proceed unless the route to be used is proven safe.|$|E
50|$|For {{the vital}} {{aspects of the}} interlocking, the Geographic Signal System (GEO) device was applied. Non-vital {{communications}} between GEO devices included Wayside Access Gateways (WAG) and Ethernet Spread Spectrum Radios (ESSR.) Some logic control as well as event data recording is supplied by the Safetran Event Analyzer Recorder (SEAR2.) A number of different I/O devices are used, including Unipolar I/O (UIO.) A large model board for local control of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> was also fabricated.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of the accident, the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> was {{properly}} set for through track movement only, so as to allow the Amtrak train to pass the freight locomotives (which should have been stopped on the side tracks) on the through tracks onto and over the bridge. The freight locomotive engineers ignored the stop signals in their locomotive cab (which were muted), and at trackside, visible to them from the cab of their locomotive.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{particularly}} as trains became longer and faster, and railroad lines grew more congested, the banjo signal was considered to have a single and terminal flaw: visibility. The internal disc was difficult to see in foggy weather and when snow clung to the glass panel. Earlier types of electro-pneumatic semaphores made by US&S had seen some limited application by 1880 as automatic block signals. The need to maintain air pressure in the long pneumatic lines eventually led the railroads to discontinue their widespread use as automatic block signals. However, these types did see long service in <b>interlocking</b> <b>plants.</b> Early semaphores also had limited range with manual wire operation and poor reliability in bad weather. Thus some railroads continued to use disc signals where automatic block signal operation was needed between manual block stations as borne out by period rule books well into the 1920s and beyond.|$|R
25|$|The United States {{had very}} little {{capacity}} for manufacturing military munitions in 1939 when World War II broke out. Since the manufacture of munitions required specialized equipment and techniques there were no existing plants that could be converted. The solution {{to the lack of}} capacity was to create a large network of <b>interlocking</b> ammunition <b>plants.</b> They would be government-owned, but contractor-operated (GOCO). More than 60 plants would be constructed between June 1940 and December 1942.|$|R
40|$|Climatic forcing {{during the}} Younger Dryas (∼ 12. 9 – 11. 5 ky B. P.) event {{has become the}} {{theoretical}} basis to explain the origins of agricultural lifestyles in the Levant by suggesting a failure of foraging societies to adjust. This explanation however, does not fit the scarcity of data for predomestication cultivation in the Natufian Period. The resilience of Younger Dryas foragers is better illustrated by a concept of adaptive cycles within a theory of adaptive change (resilience theory). Such cycles consist of four phases: release/collapse (Ω); reorganization (α), when the system restructures itself after a catastrophic stimulus through innovation and social memory—a period of greater resilience and less vulnerability; exploitation (r); and conservation (K), representing an increasingly rigid system that loses flexibility to change. The Kebarans and Late Natufians had similar responses to cold and dry conditions vs. Early Natufians and the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A responses to warm and wet climates. Kebarans and Late Natufians (α-phase) shifted to a broader-based diet and increased their mobility. Early Natufian and Pre-Pottery Neolithic A populations (r- and K-phases) had a growing investment in more narrowly focused, high-yield plant resources, but they maintained {{the broad range of}} hunted animals because of increased sedentism. These human adaptive cycles <b>interlocked</b> with <b>plant</b> and animal cycles. Forest and grassland vegetation responded to late Pleistocene and early Holocene climatic fluctuations, but prey animal cycles reflected the impact of human hunting pressure. The combination of these three adaptive cycles results in a model of human adaptation, showing potential for great sustainability of Levantine foraging systems even under adverse climatic conditions...|$|R
50|$|The use of {{wireless}} data communications allows {{a large number}} of distributed field hardware to be linked together without the need for failure prone physical cable links. The system is fail safe in case of loss of link or data packet corruption and any individual part of the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> will automatically ensure that the least permissive action is taken in the case of absent or inconsistent data from one of its sources.|$|E
5000|$|Check locking or traffic locking: [...] "Electric locking that enforces {{cooperation}} between the Operators at two adjacent plants {{in such a manner}} that prevents opposing signals governing the same track from being set to proceed at the same time. In addition, after a signal has been cleared and accepted by a train, check locking prevents an opposing signal at the adjacent <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> from being cleared until the train has passed through that plant." ...|$|E
50|$|Interlockings using {{electric}} motors for moving switches and signals became viable in 1894, when Siemens in Austria installed {{the first such}} interlocking at Prerov (now in the Czech Republic). Another interlocking of this type was installed in Berlin Westend in 1896. In North America, the first installation of an <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant</b> using electric switch machines was at Eau Claire, Wisconsin on the Chicago, St. Paul, Minneapolis and Omaha Railway in 1901, by General Railway Signal Company (GRS, now a unit of Alstom, headquartered in Levallois-Perret, near Paris). By 1913, this type system had been installed on 83 railroads in 35 US States and Canadian Provinces, in 440 interlocking plants using 21,370 levers.|$|E
40|$|The coir {{geotextile}} roll (CGR) is a sausage-like roll of nonwoven fibers {{made from}} coconut husks bound within a polyethylene or coir woven mesh rope (Figure 1). Mr. Lothar Bestmann of BESTMANN GMBH Ingenierbiologie (bioengineering), Wedel, Germany, invented the CGR, referring {{to it as}} a "vegetations-foschine. " The CGR incorporates wetland plants (usually as rooted sprigs or cuttings) whose roots become interlocked with the CGR fibers. The CGR with its plants is used along the face of an eroded streambank and acts principally to armor the bank, though it can also be configured to act as a current deflector. The CGR has the potential to accumulate sediment and, together with the plants, develop a strong network of <b>interlocking</b> roots and <b>plant</b> stems (Figure 2). The CGR concomitantly benefits fisheries habitat by providing both food and cover due to its proximity {{to the edge of the}} stream. When rocks are used at the base of the CGR, the rocks and CGR act together to produce substrates suited for an array of aquatic organisms. Some of these organisms adapt to. living on and within the rocks...|$|R
60|$|I {{raised from}} seed twenty-six plants, of which twelve {{proved to be}} long-styled and {{fourteen}} short-styled. They flowered well, but were not large plants. As I did not expect them to flower so soon, I did not transplant them, and they unfortunately grew with their branches closely <b>interlocked.</b> All the <b>plants</b> were covered under the same net, excepting one of each form. Of the flowers on the long-styled plants, twelve were illegitimately fertilised with their own-form pollen, taken in every case from a separate plant; and not one set a seed- capsule: twelve other flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from short-styled flowers; and they set nine capsules, each including on an average 7 good seeds, ten being the maximum number ever produced. Of the flowers on the short-styled plants, twelve were illegitimately fertilised with own-form pollen, and they yielded one capsule, including only 3 good seeds; twelve other flowers were legitimately fertilised with pollen from long-styled flowers, and these produced nine capsules, but one was bad; the eight good capsules contained on an average 8 good seeds each. Judging {{from the number of}} seeds per capsule, the fertility of the two legitimate to that of the two illegitimate unions is as 100 to 20.|$|R
40|$|A brush {{mattress}} is a layer (mattress) of interlaced live branches {{placed on}} a bank face, often with a live fascine and/or rock at the base. The live branches are cut from any adventitiously sprouting (sprouts roots from stems) woody plant, such as willow and some species of shrub dogwood and alder. The mattress and the live fascines are held in place with wire or twine, live stakes, and dead stout stakes. A brush mattress, with a live fascine and/or rock at its toe, is used along {{the face of an}} eroding bank and acts principally to armor the bank (Figure 1 a-c). The brush mattress has the potential to immediately slow velocities along the bank and accumulate sediment. Together with the sprouting plants, the brush mattress develops a strong network of <b>interlocking</b> roots and <b>plant</b> stems. The brush mattress helps to control bank erosion while serving as habitat for birds, small fur-bearing animals, and insects and other organisms that in turn are fed upon by fish and other higher organisms. Once the vegetation reaches a height of a few feet, it can provide shade to the stream- lowering water temperatures, offering protection from predators, and generally improving fish habitat. The brush mattress can also improve non-point pollution control by intercepting sediment and associated pollutants coming into the stream from overbank areas and in the flm»...|$|R
50|$|Entrance-Exit Interlocking (NX) was the {{original}} brand name {{of the first generation}} relay-based centralized traffic control (CTC) interlocking system introduced in 1936 by GRS (represented in Europe by Metropolitan-Vickers). The advent of all electric interlocking technology allowed for more automated route setting procedures as opposed to having an operator line each part of the route manually. The NX system allowed an operator looking at the diagram of a complicated junction to simply push a button on the known entrance track and another button on the desired exit track, and the logic circuitry handled all the necessary actions of commanding the underlying relay interlocking to set signals and throw switches in the proper sequence as required to provide valid route through the <b>interlocking</b> <b>plant.</b> The first NX installation was in 1937 at Brunswick on the Cheshire Lines, UK. The first US installation was on the New York Central Railroad (NYCRR) at Girard Junction, Ohio in 1937. Another NYCRR installation was on the main line between Utica, New York and Rochester, New York, and this was quickly followed up by three installations on the New York City Subway's IND Fulton Street Line in 1948.|$|E
50|$|The {{general layout}} of the Fort Eustis Military Railroad (FEMRR) {{is that of a}} loop within a loop, with a long track leading to the {{junction}} with the CSX (former Chesapeake and Ohio Railroad) line at Lee Hall. The smaller, inner loop is the Mulberry Island Subdivision, the larger, outer loop is the James River Subdivision, and the track to the Lee Hall Junction with CSX is the Industrial Subdivision. There are several spurs and one large branch, the Port Branch off the Industrial Subdivision, leading to the “Third Port” area of the post on the James River where the Army operates amphibious ships, landing craft and lighters. There are two wyes for turning equipment or whole trains: one at King Junction between the Mulberry Island and James River Subdivisions, and the other at the junction of the Industrial Subdivision with the Mulberry Island and James River Subdivisions. This latter wye was for years the site of a prominent Wye Tower that has since been removed, though the wye itself remains. The wye at King Junction served more as crossovers than as a wye; the turning of equipment and trains was normally performed at the Wye Tower <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Plant.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{interchange}} of {{cars with}} the national rail system occurs only at the Lee Hall junction where interchange tracks exist linking the FEMRR to (originally) the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&O) (now CSX). FEMRR engines and cars were not permitted on C&O tracks beyond the Yorktown Road grade crossing except in emergencies. Cars outbound from Fort Eustis would be spotted on a designated interchange track (other than passing track #493, which was a dedicated runaround track) and deemed delivered to the C&O when the bills of lading and switch lists were signed by the C&O station agent. Inbound cars would be spotted on the interchange track by the C&O and deemed delivered to the Government when uncoupled from the engine (or {{the rest of the}} train) that brought them there. FEMRR engines and trains were not allowed on the C&O main line except in emergencies. However, with proper prior arrangement, C&O trains or light engines (engines under power but not coupled to cars or dead engines) were allowed to operate on FEMRR tracks on the Industrial Subdivision (save the Port Branch), the Wye Tower <b>Interlocking</b> <b>Plant,</b> and the part of the James River Subdivision between O’Brien, the wye and Hanks, including Hanks Yard. The Commanding Officer, Company A, 714th TBROS&DE had to approve the use of any other tracks by the C&O. All C&O trains and light engines were to be provided a pilot and any necessary highway crossing protection.|$|E
