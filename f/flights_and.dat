40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the influence of}} international resource price movements on capital outflows from resource-rich developing countries (RRDCs) by distinguishing capital <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> capital transfers. The volume of capital <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> transfers are calculated and their determinants are analyzed using macro-panel data constituting 21 resource-rich developing countries from 1990 to 2011. Through the regression analysis, the linkage between capital <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> resource revenue {{as well as that}} between capital <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> debt is suggested. The results of this analysis suggest the need to focus on capital outflow from RRDCs through transnational companies. ...|$|R

40|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>and</b> {{reproduction}} {{are usually}} considered as two life history traits that compete for resources in a migratory insect. The beet webworm, Loxostege sticticalis L., manages {{the costs of}} migratory <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> reproduction through a trade-off in timing of these two life history traits, where migratory behavior occurs during the preoviposition period. To gain insight into how migratory <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> reproduction are coordinated in the female beet webworm, we conducted experiments beginning {{at the end of}} the preoviposition period. We used flight mills to test whether <b>flight</b> performance <b>and</b> supportive <b>flight</b> musculature <b>and</b> fuel are affected by the number of eggs oviposited, or by the age of mated and unmated females after onset of oviposition by the former. The results showed that flight distance, flight velocity, <b>flight</b> duration, <b>and</b> <b>flight</b> muscle mass decreased abruptly at the onset of oviposition, compared to that of virgin females of the same age which did not change over the next 7 d. These results indicate that onset of oviposition triggers a decrease in <b>flight</b> performance <b>and</b> capacity in female beet webworms, as a way of actively managing reallocation of resources away from migratory <b>flight</b> <b>and</b> into egg production. In addition to the abrupt switch, there was a gradual, linear decline in flight performance, <b>flight</b> muscle mass, <b>and</b> <b>flight</b> fuel relative to the number of eggs oviposited. The histolysis of <b>flight</b> muscle <b>and</b> decrease of triglyceride content indicate a progressive degradation in the ability of adults to perform additional migratory flights after onset of oviposition. Although the results show that substantial, albeit reduced, long-duration flights remain possible after oviposition begins, additional long-distance migratory flights probably are not launched after the initiation of oviposition...|$|R
