5|$|A <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> facing Kenya was {{a border}} dispute in North East Province, {{alongside}} Somalia. Ethnic Somalis inhabited this region {{and claimed that}} it should be part of Somalia, not Kenya. Kenyatta refused to accede to their demands, insisting that the land remain Kenyan. In June 1962 Kenyatta travelled to Mogadishu to discuss the issue with the Somalian authorities, but the two sides could not reach an agreement.|$|E

5|$|The evicted {{residents}} were mostly Jewish immigrants from Arab states whose weak financial status left them vulnerable to Kollek's plan. The following steep increase in real-estate values of formerly depressed areas like Mamilla near the former armistice {{line and the}} Old City was perceived by evicted Mizrahi Jews as an injustice. This became a <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> in 1970s Israeli social upheaval and {{the founding of the}} Black Panthers movement in Israel.|$|E
40|$|Information systems (IS) {{departments}} face {{many challenges}} in today’s rapidly changing environment. One approach {{to understanding the}} challenges faced by IS departments is to survey IS managers to elicit what they consider are <b>key</b> <b>issues.</b> <b>Key</b> <b>issues</b> in IS management surveys have been conducted {{for many years in}} many nations and regions. However, most of these surveys lack a theoretical basis for the selection of <b>key</b> <b>issues.</b> Furthermore, most studies have used a multi-round Delphi method. Recently, the analysis of <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> in IS management has been extended by a multimethod approach using Q methodology and interpretive structural modeling. This paper provides an overview of research approaches to <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> studies combined with results from previous research. The paper presents methodological issues and choices for a planned survey on <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> in IS management in Norway in 1999. A three step procedure for <b>key</b> <b>issues</b> selection is introduced, and a multimethod approach for analysis is adopted. Since this research is at an early stage, the paper primarily serves as a basis for discussion and feedback {{to improve the quality of}} the proposed study...|$|R

5|$|Home Rule was the <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> in British {{politics}} in the late 1880s. The debate revolved around granting Ireland more powers to govern themselves. William Ewart Gladstone, the Liberal Prime Minister, proposed the First Home Rule Bill in April 1886, aiming to devolve power to Ireland. The Conservatives were opposed to the Bill, and were joined {{by a number of}} Liberal members in defeating the Bill. This caused a split in the Liberal party, the creation of the Liberal Unionist Party, and a fresh general election, just a year after the last. At the 1886 general election, the Conservatives entered government with Lord Salibsury as Prime Minister. They formed a majority with the Liberal Unionists.|$|E
5|$|As Isma'il al-Azhari {{began to}} assert his power, both Sayyid Ali al-Mirghani and Sayyid Abd al-Rahman became {{concerned}} that they would lose their political influence. From October 1955 Sayyid Ali began to seek ways to oust Isma'il al-Azhari from power. A <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> was whether a plebiscite should be held to determine if Sudan was to be independent of Egypt, which Sayyid Ali supported and Isma'il al-Azhari opposed. To strengthen his position in parliament, Isma'il al-Azhari started making overtures to associates of Sayyid Abd al-Rahman to explore {{the idea of an}} NUP-Umma coalition. Sudan formally became independent on 1 January 1956. On 2 February 1956 Isma'il al-Azhari announced a new cabinet that included representatives of all political parties and factions.|$|E
5|$|The {{turquoise}} parrot {{was once}} common across the Sydney region, and particularly abundant between the localities of Parramatta and Penrith. It dramatically declined in numbers between 1875 and 1895, although rare sightings in western Sydney and the Blue Mountains {{were recorded in}} the mid-twentieth century. The turquoise parrot was trapped for the aviary trade and used as pie-filling. Almost all of its preferred habitat, the Cumberland Plain, across western Sydney, had disappeared with development. Over half the woodland in New South Wales, and 80% across Australia has been cleared, and the remaining habitat is fragmented. A <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> is removal of mature eucalypts with resulting loss of hollows available for nesting. The species is thus listed as a Vulnerable species under Schedule 2 of the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act, 1995 because of habitat destruction (TSC Act). Fire-burning regimes may be resulting in the regeneration favouring shrubs rather than grasses, which are the preferred food source for the species. Feral cats and foxes are a threat, particularly to nesting birds and young.|$|E

5|$|Whilst airport {{development}} in the UK is subject to local planning authority processes, the government regards airports as {{an important part of}} the national infrastructure and which therefore requires their development to be planned with a strategic approach. To support this, the government began a three-year public consultation process with the publication in December 2000 of The Future of Aviation consultation document. This outlined the issues underpinning air transport and sought views on how they should be addressed in any future policy. One of the main questions asked was whether policy should focus on meeting demand or whether it should focus instead on limiting the negative effects of air transport. Another <b>key</b> <b>issue</b> for which views were sought was how the industry might best meet the environmental costs it incurs. Between July 2002 and February 2003 a further seven regional consultation documents were published. These focussed on the economic, environmental, social and airspace appraisals relating to options for future airport development specific to the regions, and together they generated half a million responses. During the Spring of 2003 workshops based on a consultation document titled Aviation and the Environment - Using Economic Instruments were held to seek stakeholder views on the desirability and effectiveness of various financial measures that might address the environmental impacts of aviation. The consultation process ended in December 2003 with the publication of The Future of Air Transport White Paper which detailed the government's conclusions.|$|E

However, current IBC-based solutions were not addressing the problem of secure private <b>key</b> <b>issuing.</b> In this {{paper we propose a}} novel secure <b>key</b> <b>issuing</b> scheme for P 2 P networks using IBC. We present an IBC infrastructure setup phase, a peer registration solution using Shamir’s (k, n) secret sharing scheme, and a secure <b>key</b> <b>issuing</b> scheme, which adopts key generate centre (KGC) and key privacy authorities (KPAs) to <b>issue</b> private <b>keys</b> to peers securely.
