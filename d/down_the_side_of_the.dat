5|$|Artillery and {{long-range}} {{machine gun}} fire continued to riddle the wrecks and the combined crews {{were ordered to}} evacuate as the officers set the scuttling charges which would sink the blockships in their current, useless locations. As men scrambled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cruisers into Coastal Motor Boats which would relay them to the Offshore Squadron, destroyers moved closer to Ostend to cover the retreat and the monitors continued their heavy fire. Godsal {{was the last to}} leave, picked up by launch ML276 commanded by Lieutenant Rowley Bourke. With the main assault a complete failure, the blockading forces returned to Dover and Dunkirk to assess the disaster.|$|E
5|$|By the 16th {{century the}} barbican had been {{demolished}} {{to make way}} for houses and the moat had begun to be occupied with housing. By 1600 the moat was almost entirely silted up and houses had been built all {{around the edge of the}} bailey wall. In 1611 King James I sold Oxford Castle to Francis James and Robert Younglove, who in turn sold it to Christ Church College in 1613. The college then leased it to a number of local families over the coming years. By this time Oxford Castle was in a weakened state, with a large crack running <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> keep.|$|E
5|$|Calculations {{show that}} the tank would have begun to {{overflow}} at about 05:20. There is evidence suggesting that a high-level switch, which should have detected that the tank was full and shut off the supply, failed to operate. The switch failure should have triggered an alarm, but it too appears to have failed. Forty-one minutes later, an estimated 300tonnes of petrol would have spilled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tank through the roof vents onto the ground inside a bund walla semi-enclosed compound surrounding several tanks.|$|E

5|$|Completion of {{the station}} {{buildings}} was delayed for many years. Designed by the architect Charles Holden, the pre-war plans included a large entrance building {{at the top of}} the hill next to The Woodman public house with a pair of escalators between the entrance and the sub-surface concourse. These were to be enclosed in an inclined structure <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cutting parallel with the surface tracks. Taking inspiration from the local legend, the building would have been topped by a statue of Dick Whittington and his cat. When works were finished in 1957, a single, upwards only, escalator was provided to take passengers from the sub-surface ticket hall up to a simple exit {{at the top of the}} cutting.|$|E
5|$|The {{exhumation}} of Yagan's head eventually proceeded, without Colbung's knowledge, by excavating {{six feet}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> grave, then tunnelling horizontally {{to the location}} of the box. Thus the exhumation was performed without disturbing any other remains. The following day, a forensic palaeontologist from the University of Bradford positively identified the skull as Yagan's by correlating the fractures with those described in Pettigrew's report. The skull was then kept at the museum until 29 August, when it was handed over to the Liverpool City Council.|$|E
5|$|Deciding to work together, Bart, Lisa, and Bob {{escape and}} try to save the dam. While Lisa and Bob set about {{defusing}} Cecil's dynamite, Bart jumps at Cecil before he can press the plunger. Cecil attempts to swat him off with the briefcase of money, but the case bursts open and the money is lost. Cecil manages to throw Bart off the cliff, declaring he will kill Bart as Bob never could; ironically, Bob grabs the cord of the dynamite and dives down {{in an effort to}} save him. As the two dangle <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dam, Bob decides to cut the cord on the dynamite in an act of self-sacrifice to prevent Cecil from destroying the town, but his and Bart's perilous fall is broken by a conveniently placed pipe.|$|E

5|$|The {{two ships}} opened fire just before 18:00 {{at a range}} of about , with Shannon scoring the first hit, {{striking}} Chesapeake {{on one of her}} forward gunports with two round shot and a bag of musket balls fired by William Mindham, the gun captain of the aftmost of Shannons starboard 18-pounders. Chesapeake was moving faster than Shannon, and as she ranged <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> British ship, the destruction inflicted by the precise and methodical gunnery of the British crew moved aft with the American's forward gun crews suffering the heaviest losses. However, the American crew were well drilled and, despite their losses, returned fire briskly. As Chesapeake was heeling, many of their shots struck the water or waterline of Shannon causing little damage, but American carronade fire caused serious damage to Shannons rigging. In particular, a 32-pound carronade ball struck the piled shot for the Shannons 12-pounder gun that was stowed in the main chains; the shot was propelled through the timbers to scatter like hail across the gundeck.|$|E
5|$|The wings {{were of a}} broad 55 m² (590ft²) {{area and}} had a span of 18 m (59ft 0⅝ in) with a {{straight}} leading edge which curved in a near-perfect semicircle into the trailing edge. The positions of the wing roots were offset. The leading edge wing root merged with {{the top of the}} fuselage and cockpit. As the wing extended backwards, by roughly two thirds, it declined downwards at a sharp angle so that the trailing edge wing root ended nearly halfway <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fuselage increasing the angle of incidence. This design feature was used on all future Dornier bomber designs, namely the Dornier Do 217. The trailing edge was faired into the round fuselage shape. The engine nacelle was also faired into the flaps. The extreme rear of the nacelle was hollow and allowed the flap with an attached vertical slot to fit into the cavity when deployed.|$|E

25|$|Hill died in Hampstead, London in 1879. He {{is buried}} in Westminster Abbey; there is a {{memorial}} to him on his family grave in Highgate Cemetery. There are streets named after him in Hampstead (off Haverstock Hill, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Royal Free Hospital) and Tottenham (off White Hart Lane). A Royal Society of Arts blue plaque, unveiled in 1893, commemorates Hill at the Royal Free Hospital in Hampstead.|$|E

25|$|Taranaki is geologically young, having {{commenced}} activity approximately 135,000years ago. The {{most recent}} volcanic activity was {{the production of}} a lava dome in the crater and its collapse <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain in the 1850s or 1860s. Between 1755 and 1800, an eruption sent a pyroclastic flow down the mountain's northeast flanks, and a moderate ash eruption occurred about 1755, of the size of Ruapehu's activity in 1995/1996. The last major eruption occurred around 1655. Recent research has shown that over the last 9,000years minor eruptions have occurred roughly every 90years on average, with major eruptions every 500years.|$|E
25|$|NY296 {{continues}} northeast after CR23, {{passing a}} local church near the junction with Peck Road. The route proceeds due north after Peck Road, quickly entering a junction with CR14 (Goshen Street), which merges {{into the state}} highway. NY296 winds through the Catskills past Thomas Cole Mountain. After winding <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain, NY296 enters the hamlet of Hensonville, located adjacent to Batavia Kill, a tributary of Schoharie Creek. Here, the route intersects with the western terminus of CR40 (Maple Crest Road). At this junction, NY296 turns northwest on the CR40 right-of-way, while CR65 (Brooksburg Road) continues north towards NY23.|$|E
25|$|The {{tunnelling}} {{work was}} done by hand. The usual danger from the extensive use of explosives in the tunnels and cuttings was increased by the unstable nature of the rock and the steep drop <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Barron Gorge. The average slope of the ground was 45 degrees, covered with a disjointed layer of decomposed soil and rock varying in depth from 5 to 8m. Robb had to dig deep into hillsides to find solid ground, and multiple deviations from the original surveyed route also increased his costs. Red Bluff and Glacier Rock were exposed when earth, rocks and trees were removed, again by hand, from above the line (escarpments had to be cleared and levelled back).|$|E

25|$|Up {{until this}} eruption, {{it had been}} assumed that Hekla was {{incapable}} of producing the most dangerous of volcanic phenomena, the pyroclastic flow. In January 2003, however, a team from the Norvol Institute in Reykjavík, {{under the leadership of}} Dr. Ármann Höskuldsson, reported that they found traces of a pyroclastic flow, roughly 5km long, stretching <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mountain. This will call for a reappraisal of volcanic eruptions of the basic rock type, which up to now were generally thought not to produce large pyroclastic flows. It will also require that the public and curious spectators who always rush to the scene {{at the start of a}} new outbreak, be kept much further away from the volcanic activity than was thought necessary during previous outbreaks.|$|E
25|$|By November 2007, {{the game}} was about pride with both teams {{national}} title hopes dashed by USC's losses to Stanford and Oregon, and Cal's 3 in a row loss to Oregon State, UCLA, and Arizona State. Played in the Memorial Stadium in Berkeley under intense rain, the Golden Bears donned throwback uniforms honoring 1975 All-American Cal quarterback Joe Roth. Designed by Nike, the helmet was gold with 2 blue lines bordering a center white line. The Cal logo {{on the side of}} the helmet was replaced by a white C inside a blue oval. The jerseys were blue with yellow numbering but does not feature the player's name. 2 blue lines bordered a white center line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> yellow pants.|$|E
25|$|El Al's historic, {{superseded}} livery {{featured a}} turquoise/navy blue stripe <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> aircraft, and a turquoise tailfin with {{the flag of}} Israel at the top. El Al's logo was featured above the front run of windows {{on each side of}} the plane in the turquoise/navy scheme. The new livery features a blue stripe with a thick silver border on the bottom that sweeps across the side of the aircraft near the wing, disappears over the top of the plane and reappears at the bottom of the tailfin. The El Al logo is part of the design, although it has been changed slightly since then. Most of El Al's aircraft are named for Israeli cities, such as Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, Bet Shemesh, Nazeret, Haifa, and others. The cities' names are located near the nose of the plane beneath the cockpit windows.|$|E
