40|$|Engine testing, ceramic {{component}} fabrication and evaluation, component performance rig testing, and producibility experiments at Pontiac comprised AGT 100 {{activities of}} this period, January to December 1984. Two experimental engines were available {{and allowed the}} evaluation of eight experimental assemblies. Operating time accumulated was 115 hr of burning and 156 hr total. Total cumulative engine operating time is now 225 hr. Build number 11 and 12 of engine S/N 1 totaled 28 burning hours and constituted a single assembly of the engine core [...] the compressor, both turbines, and the gearbox. Build number 11 of engine S/N 1 included a 1 : 07 hr continuous test at 100 % gasifier speed (86, 000 rpm). Build number 8 of engine S/N 2 was the first engine test with a ceramic turbine rotor. A mechanical loss test of an engine assembly revealed the actual losses to be near the original design allowance. Component development activity included rig testing of the compressor, combustor, and regenerator. Compressor testing was initiated on a rig modified to control the transfer of heat between flow path, lubricating oil, and structure. Results show successful thermal decoupling of the rig and lubricating/cooling oil. Rig evaluation of a reduced-friction compressor was initiated. Combustor testing covered qualification of ceramic parts for engine use, mapping of operating range limits, and evaluation of a relocated <b>igniter</b> <b>plug.</b> Several seal refinements were tested on the hot regenerator rig. An alternate regenerator disk, extruded MAS, was examined and found to be currently inadequate for the AGT 100 application. Also, a new technique for measuring leakage was explored on the regenerator rig. Ceramic component activity {{has focused on the}} development of state-of-the-art material strength characteristics in full-scale hardware. Injection-molded sintered alpha-SiC rotors were produced at Carborundum in an extensive process and tool optimization study...|$|E
50|$|Two General Electric CJ610-6 {{single-rotor}} axial-flow turbojet {{engines are}} pylon-mounted {{on each side}} of the aft fuselage. Each engine is rated at 2950 pounds of thrust at sea level. The engine compartments consist of an eight-stage axial-flow compressor directly coupled to a two-stage turbine, a through-flow annular combustion system, variable inlet guide vanes, controlled compressor interstage bleed, exhaust nozzle and accessory drive system. Starting ignition is provided by a dual output capacitor-discharge system. As the ignition cycle is completed, the <b>igniter</b> <b>plugs</b> cease sparking and combustion becomes self-sustaining. A fuel control metering system selects the rate of fuel flow to the engine combustor.|$|R
50|$|Usually {{there are}} two <b>igniter</b> <b>plugs</b> in {{different}} positions in the combustion system. A high voltage spark is used to ignite the gases. The voltage is stored up from a low voltage (usually 28 V DC) supply provided by the aircraft batteries. It builds up to the right value in the ignition exciters (similar to automotive ignition coils) and is then released as a high energy spark. Depending on various conditions, such as flying through heavy rainfall, the igniter continues to provide sparks to prevent combustion from failing if the flame inside goes out. Of course, {{in the event that}} the flame does go out, there must be provision to relight. There is a limit of altitude and air speed at which an engine can obtain a satisfactory relight.|$|R

40|$|A {{workhorse}} liquid oxygen-liquid methane (LOX/LCH 4) rocket igniter {{was recently}} tested at NASA Glenn Research Center s (GRC) Research Combustion Laboratory (RCL). These {{tests were conducted}} {{in support of the}} Reaction Control Engine (RCE) development task of the Propulsion and Cryogenics Advanced Development (PCAD) project. The igniter was a GRC in-house design used to evaluate the ignition processes for LOX/LCH 4. The test matrix was developed to examine the flammability of LOX/LCH 4 over a range of oxidizer-to-fuel mixture ratios, both in the core fuel flow and total flow. In addition, testing also examined the durability of the hardware by accumulating ignition pulses. Over the course of testing, a total of 1402 individual ignition pulses were successfully demonstrated over the range of mixture ratios. Testing was halted after the failure of the ceramic in the <b>igniter</b> spark <b>plug...</b>|$|R
40|$|As part of NASA's {{technology}} development of liquid methane / liquid oxygen engines for future exploration missions, two different igniters were recently studied at NASA Marshall Space Flight Center. The first igniter tested was an impinging injection, spark-initiated torch igniter, {{and the second}} was a microwave-generated plasma igniter. The purpose of the ignition tests was to define the ignition limits under vacuum conditions and characterize the transient start-up performance {{as a function of}} propellant mixture ratio (MR), mass flow rates, inlet temperatures, and pre-ignition chamber pressure. In addition, for the impinging igniter two different spark plugs were tested, and for the microwave igniter the magnetron filament warm-up time and the magnetron input power were both varied. The results gathered from these tests indicated that the impinging igniter is capable of operating over an MR range of 2 - 27, with methane and oxygen inlet temperatures as low as - 161 F and - 233 F, respectively. The microwave igniter was tested over an MR range of 2 - 9, with methane and oxygen inlet temperatures as low as - 90 F and - 200 F, respectively. The microwave igniter achieved ignition over this range, although an upper ignition limit was determined for the oxidizer mass flow rate. In general, the torch exhaust temperatures for the microwave igniter were not as high as those attained with the impinging igniter. The microwave igniter, however, was hot-fired 17 times and was still operational, whereas the impinging <b>igniter</b> spark <b>plugs</b> experienced thermal shock and erosion over nine hot-fire tests. It was concluded that for the microwave igniter better mixing of the propellants might be required in order to both raise the torch exhaust temperature and decrease the required magnetron input power, and for the impinging <b>igniter</b> the spark <b>plug</b> position within the igniter chamber should be varied in future tests to identify a more optimal location. All of the igniter tests were supported by the Propulsion & Cryogenics Advanced Development project, which is part of NASA's Exploration Technology Development Program...|$|R
40|$|The Lunar Cargo Transportation and Landing by Soft Touchdown (Lunar CATALYST) {{program is}} {{establishing}} multiple no-funds-exchanged Space Act Agreement (SAA) partnerships with U. S. private sector entities. The {{purpose of this}} program is to encourage the development of robotic lunar landers that can be integrated with U. S. commercial launch capabilities to deliver payloads to the lunar surface. As part of the efforts in Lander Technologies, NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) is developing liquid oxygen (LOX) and liquid methane (LCH 4) engine technology {{to share with the}} Lunar CATALYST partners. Liquid oxygen and liquid methane propellants are attractive owing to their relatively high specific impulse for chemical propulsion systems, modest storage requirements, and adaptability to NASA's Journey to Mars plans. Methane has also been viewed as a possible propellant choice for lunar missions, owing to the performance benefits and as a technology development stepping stone to Martian missions. However, in the development of methane propulsion, methane ignition has historically been viewed as a high risk area in the development of such an engine. A great deal of work has been conducted in the past decade devoted to risk reduction in LOX/CH 4 ignition. This paper will review and summarize the history and results of LOX/CH 4 ignition programs conducted at NASA. More recently, a NASA-developed Augmented Spark Impinging (ASI) igniter body, which utilizes a conventional spark exciter system, is being tested with LOX/CH 4 to help support internal and commercial engine development programs, such as those in Lunar CATALYST. One challenge with spark exciter systems, especially at altitude conditions, is the ignition lead that transmits the high voltage pulse from the exciter to the spark <b>igniter</b> (spark <b>plug).</b> The ignition lead can be prone to corona discharge, reducing the energy delivered by the spark and potentially causing non-ignition events. For the current work, a commercial compact exciter system, which eliminates this high voltage cabling, was tested at altitude conditions. A modified, conventional exciter system with an improved ignition lead was also recently tested at altitude conditions. This test program demonstrated the capability of these exciter systems to operate at altitude. While more extensive testing may be required, these systems or similar ones may be used for future NASA and commercial engine programs...|$|R
40|$|An {{introduction}} {{to the problems of}} ignition in the petrol and gas turbine engine is given. Two new ignition devices are considered for their suitability to overcome these problems and a series of experiments were performed to evaluate their relative merits. The use of a laser spark {{and the development of a}} plasma <b>plug</b> <b>igniter</b> were compared with sparks of variable energy produced between two electrodes. A simple combustion chamber was used for the experiments and ionisation probes were used to follow the propagation of the flame from the ignition source and through the gaseous mixtures. The conditions of the experiments were as follows: Pre-mixed methane/air of 1. 0, 0. 8 and 0. 6 stoichiometry Pressures 101 kN/m 2 - 1067 kN/m 2 Laser spark energies 30 mJ - 400 mJ Plasma plug energies 50 mJ - 1500 mJ Electrode spark energies 10 mJ - 2500 mJ Samples of the combustion products were taken and the results for the three mixture ratios are presented. The performances of the three ignition methods are presented by plotting the flame speeds observed from the ignition sources as functions of energy. Practical considerations eliminate the use of the laser as an ignition method but the plasma plug could be used for automotive applications if some control of the energy was exercised. The gas turbine engine appears to be the roost likely application of the plasma plug as it offers greater penetration into the combustion chamber than current surface discharge igniters. </p...|$|R
40|$|Igniter {{technologies}} {{have seen an}} increased interest in the past decades due to the increasing re-ignition needs, such as for the upper stage Vinci engine. Weight reduction considerations and redundancy considerations have lead to an increased number of studies in alternative igniter technologies to the conventional pyrotechnical or spark <b>plug</b> <b>igniters</b> in use today. Such technologies include concepts such as resonance igniters, catalyst igniters and laser igniters. When compared to classical ignition methods, both in the automotive industry, i. e. spark ignition, and in the space industry, i. e. pyrotechnic/torch ignition, laser ignition system (LIS) offer multiple advantages. Literature classifies laser-gas interactions into four main categories which differ in the mechanisms leading to ignition: non-resonant breakdown ignition, resonant breakdown ignition, thermal ignition and photochemical ignition. Non-resonant laser ignition {{is the most common}} form of ignition and involves a well-focused pulsed laser beam thus creating a well localized plasma which can accumulate further energy leading to a local increase in temperature and finally ignition. Non-resonant laser ignition may occur via either a multiphoton ionization process or an electron cascade process. This paper addresses the main issues related with the various laser ignition methods via a literature review of research conducted in the field of laser ignition. The main findings of the experimental work done in the non-resonant laser ignition of a coaxial liquid oxygen and gaseous methane jet at the DLR Lampoldshausen M 3. 1 test bench is presented...|$|R
40|$|Large scale {{experiments}} {{were performed to}} determine the effectiveness of thermal glow <b>plug</b> <b>igniters</b> to burn hydrogen in a condensing steam environment due {{to the presence of}} water sprays. The {{experiments were}} designed to determine if a detonation or accelerated flame could occur in a hydrogen-air-steam mixture which was initially nonflammable due to steam dilution but was rendered flammable by rapid steam condensation due to water sprays. Eleven Hydrogen Igniter Tests were conducted in the test vessel. The vessel was instrumented with pressure transducers, thermocouple rakes, gas grab sample bottles, hydrogen microsensors, and cameras. The vessel contained two prototypic engineered systems: (1) a deliberate hydrogen ignition system and (2) a water spray system. Experiments were conducted under conditions scaled to be nearly prototypic of those expected in Advanced Light Water Reactors (such as the Combustion Engineering (CE) System 80 +), with prototypic spray drop diameter, spray mass flux, steam condensation rates, hydrogen injection flow rates, and using the actual proposed plant igniters. The lack of any significant pressure increase during the majority of the burn and condensation events signified that localized, benign hydrogen deflagration(s) occurred with no significant pressure load on the containment vessel. Igniter location {{did not appear to be}} a factor in the open geometry. Initially stratified tests with a stoichiometric mixture in the top showed that the water spray effectively mixes the initially stratified atmosphere prior to the deflagration event. All tests demonstrated that thermal glow plugs ignite hydrogen-air-steam mixtures under conditions with water sprays near the flammability limits previously determined for hydrogen-air-steam mixtures under quiescent conditions. This report describes these experiments, gives experimental results, and provides interpretation of the results. 12 refs., 127 figs., 16 tabs...|$|R
