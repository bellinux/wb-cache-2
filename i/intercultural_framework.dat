This methodology allows us to study how motivations, misconceptions and prejudices play a role. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} research is to show not the quantitative results of this policy of incorporation, but the factors involved in it, and the consequences for migrant participation in the cultural associations.

40|$|The article {{seeks to}} {{illustrate}} Italian educational policies {{for students with}} an immigrant background {{within the context of}} the EU <b>intercultural</b> <b>framework.</b> Italy can be considered the EU country where interculturalism is more widely recognized in terms of pedagogical theory and school legislation. However, the Italian approach is characterized by a weak and contradictory relationship between policy, teaching strategies and educational experiences. To support this argument, I will refer to a review of Italian sociological studies, which demonstrate the strengths and weaknesses of the interculturalism as applied to the Italian education system. The conflict between theory and practices is illustrated by empirical findings that suggest immigrant students are still not granted equality of opportunity, linguistic and cultural diversities are almost absent from most school curricula, and a positive dialogue between culturally different subjects is still more of an aspiration than a fact. More research is needed in order to monitor and evaluate if intercultural practice is indeed a true expression of the ideas to which it aspires...|$|E
40|$|Approaches to {{cultural}} and ethnic diversity can differ widely between countries {{and can also}} change {{over the course of}} time within a particular country in response to a range of factors including prevailing political ideologies, historical legacies and economic necessity. In Ireland in recent years we have seen a welcome and increasing use of the term ‘interculturalism ’ and ‘intercultural approaches to public policy’. But what is meant by interculturalism? How does it differ from multiculturalism and assimilation? How does interculturalism relate to ‘integration’? Interculturalism Interculturalism as an overall approach to ethnic and cultural diversity is becoming increasingly embedded in key public policy developments in Ireland. This is to be welcomed and marks a distinct shift away from previous ill defined/ad hoc and on occasion assimilationist approaches that characterised previous Irish government policy. In January 2005, the Government of Ireland published its National Action Plan against Racism ‘Planning for Diversity’ (NPAR) which set {{out for the first time}} an <b>intercultural</b> <b>framework</b> approach to ‘integration ’ in Ireland. The overall aim of the National Action Plan against Racism (NPAR) is to provide strategic direction to combat racism and to develop a more inclusive and intercultural society in Ireland. It states: Developing a more inclusive, intercultural society is about inclusion by design not as an add-on or afterthought. It is essentially about creating the conditions for interaction, equality of opportunity, understanding and respect. In taking this approach we embrace the concept that ‘one size does not fit all’, and that by planning for and accommodating cultural diversity, everyone will benefit from the process (NPAR 2005) ...|$|E

In the public domain, racism remains prominent in cities and presents challenges to the realization by urban Aboriginal peoples and Newcomers of their aspirations in urban society. In Winnipeg, an Aboriginal-led organisation has initiated partnerships with Newcomer settlement organisations to bring both groups together to build intercultural relationships. A case study of the United Against Racism/Aboriginal Youth Circle component of Ka Ni Kanichihk (KNK) provides the opportunity {{to examine the effects of}} its partnerships on the following matters: promoting cross-cultural understanding and friendships, changing negative perceptions and building confidence among Aboriginal peoples and Newcomers vis-a-vis each other, and help indirectly to facilitate Newcomer integration into neighbourhoods predominantly occupied by Aboriginal peoples in Winnipeg. An analysis of the data gathered on the partnership programs revealed that prior to participating in these programs there were negative preconceptions about one another based on false impressions. The programming has facilitated the sharing of cultures and ideas. This has also helped members of both groups to value their cultural differences and similar history of colonialism where they exist, develop a shared understanding of the racism that confronts Aboriginal peoples and racialized Newcomers, break down stereotypes, and build friendships. This thesis reveals that in the short term, the programs and partnerships of KNK are contributing to better cross-cultural understanding and relations within a multiculturalism framework, and that in the long term they have the potential to contribute to better cross-cultural understanding and relations within an <b>intercultural</b> <b>framework.</b> The cross-cultural networks being developed bode well for the potential of developing instrumental policy and advocacy partnerships in addressing common issues faced by Aboriginals and Newcomers through progressive urban policy in Canadian cities...|$|E
40|$|In its {{quest for}} the {{destination}} of an ‘all-encompassing’ communication, European advertising builds an image of complexity and oppositions. Constructed as a mingling of cultural values, intensive consumerism and creative touches, the story of advertising is a never-ending analysis of nowadays globalized societies. Moreover, its ramifying story of acceptance, assimilation, rejection and stereotypy brought advertising at a position in which the debate over intercultural representation and consumer behavior is crucial. Consequently, the main question that arises is: {{in the realm of}} the thirsty and goods-addict consumers, what type of discourse should advertising in Europe use, so as to emphasize pluralism and still maintain culturally personalized approaches. It is, therefore, the purpose of this paper to explore and analyze the congruencies and disparities between advertising and its social, cultural and economic repositories, on the background of Europe’s image. In this respect, some questions can be formulated: How does advertising pertain to organizing its communication with the overly globalized consumer markets? Is the stereotypical label hereby inserted in such a communicational direction with consumers, and if so, what are the features of an “addressing otherness” discourse with respect to ad typology? Another aim of the current paper is to evoke the level at which European advertising fails to stick to the <b>intercultural</b> <b>framework</b> of reference, through a presentation of the stereotypes of “otherness” and the implied “fake multiculturalism. ” The idea behind this assumption is that, while representing ethnic groups differently or by use of a derogatory mechanism, the message cannot be that of Europeanness. Moreover, the focus on linguistic choice of advertising vocabulary is linked to the issue of “linguistic fetishism” and, more importantly, it shows that the variety of linguistic panel in Europe sometimes prevents consumers from decoding the message of advertising. The sphere of this domain allowed for a new analytical introspection in the appearance of this marketing mix, which led to further wanderings in the realm of an advertising that is both plural and rigid. Such an economic force, combined with intercultural representation, serves as an effective means of changing the fairytale of consumerism abuse into a fairly-oriented European happy-end story of multicultural consumers in the land of promising advertising...|$|E
40|$|In this work, I {{attempt to}} {{contribute}} to the future of African and intercultural philosophy. This is undertaken by a comparative appraisal of the late lamented Kenyan philosopher Henry Odera Oruka's (1944 - 1995) philosophic sagacity, and intercultural philosophy as conceived by Dutch intercultural philosopher Wim van Binsbergen. Oruka (1990 a) identifies four main trends in contemporary African philosophy: ethnophilosophy, professional philosophy, nationalist-ideological philosophy, and philosophic sagacity or sage philosophy. He later added hermeneutic and artistic/literary trends (Oruka 1991). I review the debate on the existence, nature, and identity of African philosophy and posit the relevance of intercultural philosophy to contemporary African philosophy. I examine the major issues around ethnophilosophy with a reading of Tempels and Kagame and the main criticisms, especially those of Oruka, in a bid to posit his rationale for endorsing philosophic sagacity. I focus on Oruka's philosophic sagacity and the methodology used in investigating it. I attempt to answer two main questions: what is sage philosophy and how does one distinguish it from the other forms of philosophy that are available in Africa? African sage philosophy or philosophic sagacity commonly refers to the body of thought produced by persons considered wise by their communities. Oruka categorizes these wise persons into two groups: folk sages and philosophic sages. Folk sages are well versed in the popular wisdom, culture, and beliefs of their people. They are essentially conformists with the communal set-up. They are folk sages because they do not transcend the celebrated folk wisdom of their people. They remain at the first order of sage philosophy: popular wisdom. Philosophic sages are those that seek rational foundation and critically evaluate commonly held cultural beliefs. They are able to transcend the communal beliefs of their societies by taking a critical and rational distance. When interviewed by a professional philosopher, they are able to provide balanced answers on various themes, such as the nature of the Supreme Being, the nature of death, the nature of time, the concept of the person, the meaning of freedom and equality, the nature of education, and so on. This triggers Oruka to compare them to Western philosophers {{in spite of the fact}} that some of them are unable to read or write. He dismisses ethnophilosophy as a collective mode of philosophizing and endorses the individual sage as the valid mode of philosophizing. This, according to Oruka, is standard African traditional wisdom, which obtains in the African context. I also employ post-modernist (post-structuralist) and other criticisms of Oruka's philosophic sagacity and show how post-modernist ideas (deconstruction of single identity, Western hegemony, and bounded culture) are used as a bridge to my proposal of intercultural philosophy. I identify globalization as one of the most important socio-political and cultural developments in our contemporary world that needs philosophical scrutiny. I examine Oruka's philosophic sagacity and the orientations of several African philosophers to see if they can stand the test of time. This permits me to invite African/intercultural philosophers to think beyond local to global sagacity. I attempt to go beyond their positions by exploding their contentious conception of culture and examining whether intercultural communication is possible or not. This is achieved through a discussion of intercultural philosophers such as Ram Adhar Mall and Wim van Binsbergen. Finally, I identify the main challenges for the contemporary African/intercultural philosopher. The challenges are enormous, but we need to create an <b>intercultural</b> <b>framework</b> in a bid to go beyond borders. I propose an intercultural hermeneutic, one that is couched in counter-hegemonic discourses and that will allow us to cross borders, as the globalization process requires us to do...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis {{paper offers}} a {{theoretical}} model {{which focuses on}} cultural bargaining behavior. It {{is based on an}} <b>intercultural</b> negotiation <b>framework</b> of activity-based cultural types (Ott, 2011). The complexities of international negotiations are analyzed from a multi-active bargaining perspective which considers negotiation-is-an-art model. The results show the multi-active bargaining types from a seller and a buyer perspective. The differences in international negotiation behavior show the problems of cultural collisions. The possibility to circumvent these clashes {{is at the core of}} this article. The analysis proves useful as the different time perceptions, cultural activity levels and the resulting strategic behavior are clearly related to the deadlocks, stalemates, break-ups and agreements experienced in real-life scenarios. The application of the model to UK-Malaysian negotiation experiments is an example of the robustness of the theoretical results.

40|$|As the {{population}} in the United States becomes more diverse, communities are increasingly experiencing disparities in health care quality that follow racial and ethnic lines. It has been documented that improving health care providers’ intercultural communication is one way to help reduce these health disparities. This study investigated the intercultural communication practices of employees at a large teaching hospital in the Southwest that is actively working to reduce health disparities in its community. Recognizing the influence of organizational culture on communication in a workplace, this study looked not only at communication practices, but also at organizational culture and at diversity training as an artifact of organizational culture. This study used the <b>intercultural</b> praxis <b>framework</b> as a theoretical foundation and investigated the utility of the framework in this organizational setting. Both qualitative and quantitative data collection methods were used to explore employees’ intercultural communication practices. Hospital texts including website text, newsletters, and diversity training materials were analyzed to determine whether the hospital’s organizational culture supported intercultural communication practices. A survey instrument designed to measure the use of intercultural praxis modes was developed and distributed to a random sample of hospital employees to determine what communication practices employees use and whether {{there is a difference between}} the practices of employees who have and have not completed diversity training. This study sought not only to understand what communication practices are used, but also how they are used. Employees’ narratives were analyzed using a critical incident survey to investigate how intercultural communication practices are used in this organization and how organizational members define culture. Results indicate that the organizational culture at this hospital is supportive of several intercultural communication practices, and employees are using some practices more than others in their intercultural interactions, including the additional practice of avoidance. Employees understand culture as including a person’s language, ancestry, tangible attributes like gender and practices, and intangible attributes like beliefs and values. Their communication practices were found to contain four underlying factors— engagement, positioning, inquiry, and introspection—and a fifth factor, language, also emerged in both textual and narrative data as being important to employees’ intercultural communication. Findings in this study were used to build theory, including a suggested revision of the <b>intercultural</b> praxis <b>framework,</b> to contribute methodologically to communication research, and to suggest practical next steps for the hospital in their continued fight against health disparities.

40|$|Strategic {{business}} nets {{are increasingly}} important in producing economic {{value in the}} global arena. This paper examines the influence of national culture on knowledge sharing in different types of intercultural business nets. Knowledge sharing {{is essential for the}} functioning of any business network as it influences the interaction between the actors and the outcomes they can achieve. Cultural factors have for long been known to influence the communication and success potential of strategic alliances. Similarly, culture is seen to shape how actors behave in business relationships and networks involving people from several national cultures. Our basic assumption is that the nature of the cultures involved in the network and the type of network both influence the knowledge sharing barriers. This issue is studied through two conceptual frameworks. First, a framework identifying different types of strategic nets and the requirements they impose for knowledge sharing is proposed. Then a classification scheme of culture, based on the individualism-collectivism and the vertical-horizontal dimensions, is derived. The strategic-net and cultural types are then combined in an <b>intercultural</b> business-net <b>framework,</b> and the opportunities and barriers of knowledge sharing are analysed by using examples representing Asian-European and Asian-North Americ...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. May 2016. Major: Organizational Leadership, Policy, and Development. Advisor: Gerald Fry. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); vii, 207 pages. Short-term study abroad, {{often in the}} instructor-led model, is growing nationally with 60 % of students enrolling in programs of this length in 2012 - 13 (IIE, 2013). Higher education institutions’ mission statements often state that creating individuals who respect diversity or have an “international and global understanding” is a goal (Meacham & Gaff. 2006, p. 9). Study abroad {{is viewed as a}} premier vehicle to guide students to achieve this more sophisticated worldview. Current education abroad research is not clear on whether intercultural sensitivity can be increased through a short-term, instructor-led program experience. Previous studies often use metrics to compare year-long or semester length programs to short-term study abroad programs. This comparative focus has led to very little research on interventions that may enhance intercultural learning on short-term, instructor-led programs. This study examines eight instructor-led programs and aims to examine if intercultural learning can occur on an instructor-led program and what influence the instructor may have on this important learning outcome. The research questions are: 1) How does the program instructor influence students’ cultural gains and learning during instructor-led study abroad? 1 a) What is the impact of guided reflection on students’ cultural gains? 1 b) What is the impact of debriefing or not debriefing critical incidents during time abroad? 1 c) Does the leader’s intercultural sensitivity level influence students’ intercultural sensitivity? 2) What other factors influence students’ intercultural learning? 2 a) Does prior language learning influence students’ intercultural sensitivity? 2 b) Does gender influence students’ intercultural sensitivity? 2 c) Does challenge, including location, during study abroad influence students’ intercultural sensitivity during instructor-led study abroad? 2 d) Does interaction with host-country locals influence students’ intercultural sensitivity during instructor-led study abroad? A sequential quantitative to qualitative mixed methods design was employed to understand first if students could increase their intercultural sensitivity during an instructor-led program and second if these gains were related to the instructor. The population consisted of 105 students who studied abroad on three and a half week instructor-led programs in May and June of 2014. The results of the pre to post study abroad scores on the Intercultural Development Inventory showed the population made significant gains of 6. 7 points, 28 % made gains into another stage and overall 73 % of students made positive movement on the IDI. There was, however, much variability among the programs. The interviews from instructor and students showed that students having a basic understanding of <b>intercultural</b> <b>frameworks,</b> along with frequent and spontaneous facilitation by the instructor was the best method to mentor students to make greater intercultural sensitivity gains.

Differences in pragmatic conventions mark the most {{significant differences between the two}} models. At IUJ, the English for Academic Purposes (EAP) curriculum designers/instructors' attempt to promote awareness of and adherence to the standard pragmatic conventions can run into difficulty because within lUJ's self-contained campus community the large number of students who are not enrolled in English classes tend to be forceful representatives of alternative pragmatic conventions. In the search for a better understanding of the dynamics of of IUJ's multi-cultural student community and the ways in which they affect attitudes to the standard pragmatic conventions, Smith's five senses <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>framework</b> is mapped onto two recurrent stages in the fortunes of the standard pragmatic conventions: the summer recess stage and the regular terms stage. The elegance of the fit between the five senses and the known outcomes of the two stages leads to the decision to utilize the five senses as primary determinants in the design of a standard pragmatics module within one of the EAP courses. This design work, which results in the business negotiation module, is guided by the need to swim with, and not against, the main socio-cultural flows on the campus...|$|R

Based on the studies of Walsh (2007, 2009), Gomes (2007) and Tavares (2011), this work relies on decoloniality studies, mainly on the relevance of the history of Africa and Africanness in Brazilian education. Our corpus of analysis is found in the "Diretrizes Curriculares Nacionais para a Educação Básica" (DCN, 2013), the Brazilian Legislative Syllabus for Basic Education.

The findings show that participation in international youth exchanges, in addition to cultural knowledge, may contribute to increased motivation for learning, enhanced selfunderstanding and personal growth that seems transferable to other contexts. Furthermore, global youth culture plays a crucial role in young people`s experiences of being like one another across national borders, cultures and social realities...|$|R
40|$|The {{concept of}} secularism {{encompasses}} numerous aspects beyond {{the regulation of}} relations between the State and Churches. Using a critical <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>framework,</b> this research project explores the interplay between secularism, culture, religion, identity, and collective representations. Specifically, this study focuses on laïcité, the concept of secularism used in France. Previous studies have criticized laïcité for being biased and contributing to inequalities between communities in France. The pervasive (and false) representation of laïcité as originally and exclusively French has also been criticized. In {{the light of the}} concerns raised by previous studies, this study sets out to investigate (1) how knowledge about laïcité was constructed in a selection of articles from the newspaper Le Monde and (2) with which implications regarding power relations in France. This research project is informed by social constructionism and draws on concepts from critical intercultural communication, cultural and feminist studies, and a Foucaultian approach to discourse. This study includes four articles, one theoretical and three empirical. The first one explores how culture has been tackled in recent media studies and reflects on the use of critical intercultural communication to examine the construction of cultural realities in media texts. All three other articles use data from the newspaper Le Monde to respectively look at (i) strategic uses of the concept of culture as opposed to religion, (ii) collective memories evoked to associate laïcité with specific representations of the imagined community, and (iv) identity categories made relevant in discourses of laïcité. Results draw attention to the complexity, variety, and agency of using culture as a discursive resource. Findings reveal ways in which culture can be strategically evoked to normalize representations and emphasize differences between practices and individuals. This research project offers insights into post-racial expressions of racism and their practical implications as regards categorizations of individuals...|$|R
40|$|According to the National Academy of Engineering, a core {{need for}} {{engineers}} {{today is to}} be able to work with a diverse, multinational, multidisciplinary workforce. Accordingly, colleges of engineering must develop strategies to graduate engineers ready for this global and diverse job market. Actions taken by colleges of engineering to add global preparedness to their curriculum are add-ons to the core curriculum, such as optional study-abroad programs, elective courses, minors, and certificates, and have only reached a small percentage of the students and/or sometimes have not proven sufficient for today?s and future demand. Therefore, most engineering students in the United States are graduating not fully prepared to engage with the global job market they will be part of. The purpose of this study was to identify the intercultural maturity level, as determined by the <b>Intercultural</b> Maturity <b>Framework,</b> of students in the College of Engineering at Texas A&M when exposed to intercultural concepts in relation to cognitive, intrapersonal and interpersonal development. Therefore, as a result, understand how students come to appreciate cultural differences to interact effectively with different others is important. This qualitative study followed the Naturalist inquiry paradigm and used the interpretive method relying on information from interviews, documents and reports. The population for this study was the eight students enrolled in the Global Engineering Design Class during Fall 2014. The results of this study showed that this global course had a positive impact on students? intercultural maturity development. The engineering project the company provided linked their cultural learning to the engineering workplace reality. The cultural assignments and the work with the Brazilian students awakened the global interest of the students who had not traveled abroad, and it deepened the cultural understanding of the students who had traveled abroad. Most of the students who return from a study-abroad experience believe it was a life changing experience, but when they talk to potential employers about this experience, they describe the experience with the superficial ?touristy? activities they took part in while abroad. In contrast, after the Global Engineering Design class, students described this experience in a less ?life changing? manner. Interestingly, they were able to articulate, when describing the experience, their learning and what they will bring to the work environment from this experience...|$|R
40|$|This {{exploratory}} {{case study}} examines {{the role of}} culture in Chinese-English conference interpreting. Given {{that there has been}} a lack of empirical research in understanding the role of culture in conference interpreting through the lens of <b>intercultural</b> communication <b>frameworks,</b> we know relatively little about conference interpreters’ experiences with intercultural communication challenges. This project helps address this research gap by investigating the types of intercultural communication challenges that Chinese-English conference interpreters experience and their strategies in managing those challenges. This study hears the voices of both professionals and postgraduate interpreting students. A total number of 27 participants were recruited for this research. Twenty professional conference interpreter were interviewed and seven interpreting students were organized for a focus group discussion. Grounded theory was used to analyze the participants’ observations and strategies in managing intercultural communication challenges when doing Chinese-English conference interpreting. The data analysis process led to the emergence of two procedural guidelines and one process – Interpreters’ Intercultural Mediation Process. The two procedural guidelines offer guidance for the interpreters to provide the most appropriate and effective service: meet with the clients beforehand and be prepared to offer intercultural insights when consulted. Interpreters are found to follow the Interpreters’ Intercultural Mediation Process to decide when and how to mediate intercultural communication challenges at work. This Process includes four criteria, seven intercultural challenges, and seven coping strategies. This study offers theoretical and applied contributions to our understanding of the role of culture in interpreting. By jointly applying <b>frameworks</b> from <b>intercultural</b> communication and interpreting studies to examine the conference interpreting process, this case study makes great efforts to connect the field of intercultural communication with the field of interpreting studies. This study identifies the types of intercultural differences that would lead to challenges in Chinese-English conference interpreting. It also contributes to the call for a cultural turn in interpreting studies. By learning the two procedural guidelines, conference interpreters can be better prepared for their work. By following the Interpreters’ Intercultural Mediation Process, conference interpreters can better anticipate and manage the intercultural challenges at work. This study also offers guidance on tailoring intercultural communication courses for postgraduate interpreting training programs...|$|R
40|$|Young {{doctoral}} students for whom English {{is an additional}} language are facing increasing pressure to publish their research in high-ranking English-language periodicals. However, a number of potential linguistic obstacles to editorial acceptance have been identified, including ‘interference’, {{a process in which}} specific rhetorical strategies adopted in the discourse of the home ‘large’ culture are transferred into the target language during the writing process. In this study, I investigate this phenomenon in my own teaching context by using rhetorical move analysis to explore the manner in which native speakers of English and German employ rhetorical strategies in introduction sections to original research articles in medicine. While a number of existing studies point towards differences in the rhetorical organisation of English and German academic writing, a critical examination of their work reveals some significant conceptual and methodological flaws. Chief among these are a deterministic, essentialist perception of culture and a lack of rigorous quantitative analysis. In an endeavour to address this, this study adopts an <b>intercultural</b> rhetoric theoretical <b>framework</b> to root the texts firmly in their socio-cultural context and utilizes a method combining quantitative corpus-analysis with qualitative text analysis, thus adopting both a top-down and a bottom-up approach. While the study reveals a broad congruence between the two cultures in terms of fundamental move structure, it also demonstrates the existence of significant differences in the ways in which German and US-American medical researchers employ specific rhetorical steps to reference other scholars’ contributions and to establish the necessity of their own research. These findings provide a basis for the development of pedagogical strategies to raise students’ awareness of the range of specific rhetorical steps at their disposal. Developing such an awareness will not only furnish them with a larger number of rhetorical resources to develop the richness of their writing, but will also facilitate more accommodative reading, sensitising them to a range of different author strategies...|$|R
40|$|The {{comparative}} analysis of Polish and Spanish political {{discourse in the}} multilingual context of European institutions is challenging not only due to linguistic, cultural, geopolitical and social differences, {{but also because of}} a relatively short history of such contacts in the EU <b>framework.</b> <b>Intercultural</b> communication, as a dynamic social practice is a fascinating object of investigation. Bidirectional {{comparative analysis}} of Polish and Spanish oral texts allows define the barriers of such communication. It encompasses the discursive act together with its objectives, strategies and consequences, and also its raison d’être. It explains why different strategies reflected through discursive categories were used. Consequently it describes both, conditions and outcomes of identity negotiation. The latter is a political competence perceived and evaluated by the direct interlocutors, the participants of the political debate, and indirectly, by a public opinion of the European Union. That proves it is two-level communication. The negotiation of political identity through discourse, according to the Ting-Toomey theory, can lead to maintaining, loosing, recovering or reinforcing it 282. The Identity Negotiation Theory includes the construction and development of personal, relational, role and desired identity {{and is one of the}} methodological axes of this investigation. Political identity consists of exhibiting necessary competences to efficiently participate in the legislation process, for example, in order to present amendments, promote a given ideology, participate in controversial discussions and manage conflicts, and, finally, gain the support of public opinion. The analysis of creation, negotiation, maintenance, recovery and promotion of the political identity is performed through the identification and description of discursive categories proposed by Van Dijk 283 and adapted to the needs of this study. This is the second methodological axe of the investigation. The following questions arise: which discursive strategies, used by Polish and Spanish politicians, will be communication facilitators and which will be barriers hampering communication? Which strategies show political competencies of the speaker, his or her influence in the legal EU reality through discourse? [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to trace how the theatrical translation process, specifically within the genre of musical theatre, can be systematically approached by a director. Through practice-led research, this study documents the directorial process that was followed in order to translate the playtext of Bat Boy – the Musical from the American source context to the South African context. The intent of the process was to ensure that signifiers of the culture – as set out in the playtext – shifted to become indicative of the cultures of the performers who were cast in the production or target text. The first research phase addressed the theoretical framework of the study and the distinctions between theatrical translation, adaptation and variation were contemplated in order to substantiate {{the use of the term}} translation in the two-tiered translation approach suggested. In the second research phase, relevant dynamics in theatrical semiotic processes were used to analyse the playtext of Bat Boy – the Musical. In this, the first tier of translation, the dissertation surveyed the signs at work in the playtext taking cognisance of the ideological and aesthetic codes within the source text. Then, the corresponding social and textual codes within the socio-cultural domain to which the playtext was translated were investigated. The third research phase and second tier of translation occurred on the level of the mise-en-scène. Here, the directorial strategy was to engage the performers actively in the translation process, by including their respective artistic and cultural paradigms in the translation of the playtext and the characters contained therein. The translation of the playtext was explored within the cross cultural – and more specifically the <b>intercultural</b> – theatrical <b>framework</b> by allowing the multicultural and multilingual cast to source their diverse, cultural backgrounds and unique social codes as well as South African theatrical codes in order to place the musical in the South African context. The fourth and final research phase reflects upon the intercultural translation of Bat Boy – the Musical and considers, not only the efficacy of the directorial process for the translation of a musical theatre playtext from one cultural context to another, but also how this particular form of American musical theatre resonates within the multicultural and multilingual South African society.
