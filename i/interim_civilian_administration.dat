50|$|An <b>interim</b> <b>civilian</b> <b>administration</b> {{was set up}} in Pińsk, but the {{hostilities}} continued. There were {{instances of}} Polish soldiers being singled out at night and murdered. On April 5, 1919, seventy-five Jewish residents of the city met at a local Zionist center to discuss the distribution of American relief aid according to eyewitness accounts.

Some accounts allege that the meeting had received approval from Polish military authorities although the language barrier was severe, as many locals had no idea {{what it meant to be}} part of the newly-reborn Poland after a century of foreign rule. When Major Aleksander Narbut-Łuczyński heard, that the meeting was a Bolshevik gathering, he initially ordered his troops to arrest the meeting organizers. He was told that the purpose of the meeting was to plot an armed anti-Polish uprising and, without further investigation, ordered the execution of the hostages. Within an hour, thirty-five detainees were put against the wall of the town's cathedral, and executed by a firing squad composed of the Polish soldiers. It was claimed that some men and women were stripped and beaten.|$|E
