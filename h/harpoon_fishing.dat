5000|$|Tools {{relating}} to {{hunting and fishing}} such as boats, floats, <b>harpoons,</b> <b>fishing</b> net, fish pounds, and bows provide information on {{the age of the}} rock art and livelihood of the time. This site also has scenes of whales and tigers being captured with a net. Although no prehistoric net has yet been excavated, fine marks of net on pottery discovered in the Dongsam-dong midden suggest that nets were widely used not only for fishing but also for hunting in those days. The site has scenes showing whaling activities in great detail. Around 5-17 people are on boats surrounding whales. The bows and sterns are semi-circular and are connected to a harpoon stuck into the body of whales and to floats hanging on a rope. The tools are almost identical to those used by natives for whaling today.|$|R
5000|$|Salmon spawned in most {{rivers and}} streams in California {{sometime}} during the year and were a welcome addition to the diet of the hunter-gatherer California people living near almost all the streams. Many tribes migrated to a given area along the streams during spawning runs to harvest the fish. Fish were caught with spears, <b>harpoons,</b> <b>fish</b> nets, fish traps (fishing weirs), hooks and fishing lines, gathering seafood by hand and using specific plant toxins (soaproot, buckeye nuts, and wild cucumber root) to temporarily paralyze the fish so they would float to the surface where could easily be captured. About the only early competitors for fish was the California grizzly bears who lived in California then and who also liked salmon. Salmon and other fish were usually eaten almost immediately, smoked or sun dried and stored in woven baskets so they could not spoil and were available to eat nearly year-round.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} expands current {{theoretical and}} practical knowledge of variability in the technological strategies practiced by past forager societies. Specifically, it examines the interplay between raw material innate and working properties, and tool design {{as they relate to}} skeletal media and technologies. Data were synthesized from existing biomedical literature on the structure and mechanical properties of technologically-relevant osseous media, including bird and cetacean bone, and antler. Original laboratory tests were then conducted to determine the mechanical properties of Young's modulus (intrinsic stiffness), intrinsic strength, and fracture resistance of the compact tissue of reindeer antler, cervid long bones, and the limb bones of the California sea lion. Cervid compact limb tissue is stiff, strong, and brittle, while reindeer antler is flexible and highly fracture-resistant (tough). Air-drying hardens all skeletal tissues, and greatly increases investment times for creating tool blanks of both antler and cervid limb bone. Water -soaking can soften dry antler, but may have little effect on the workability of previously-dried land mammal limb bone. Finally, data on the mechanical and working properties of osseous tissues were applied to an analysis of the raw material selection and tool design strategies practiced by protohistoric Alutiiq foragers of Alaska's Kodiak region. Drawing on a sample of over 300 osseous tools and tool blanks, the engineering designs of five tool types were investigated: unbarbed arrows, barbed sea mammal <b>harpoons,</b> <b>fishing</b> <b>harpoon</b> tips, woodworking wedges, and awls. By employing multiple analytical scales, the study points to multiple design pathways toward a generalized goal of maximizing tool longevity, or circulation time. Tool fracture potential can be reduced through raw material selection and stress-reducing structural design. Alutiiq designs for longevity include nested <b>fish</b> <b>harpoon</b> valves, and the off-set line holes on unilaterally barbed harpoons. Also, both tool types were created most frequently from tough but non-local antler. Tool recycling and conservation to avoid drying and fracture can likewise increase tool use-lives. For osseous tools, maximizing longevity might offset high initial tool production investments. The results are applicable to processes of technology transfer in many protohistoric contexts and the Upper Paleolithic of Eurasia...|$|R

60|$|Whether {{to admit}} Hercules among us or not, {{concerning}} this I long remained dubious: for though {{according to the}} Greek mythologies, that antique Crockett and Kit Carson--that brawny doer of rejoicing good deeds, was swallowed down and thrown up by a whale; still, whether that strictly makes a whaleman of him, that might be mooted. It nowhere appears that he ever actually <b>harpooned</b> his <b>fish,</b> unless, indeed, from the inside. Nevertheless, he may be deemed a sort of involuntary whaleman; at any rate the whale caught him, {{if he did not}} the whale. I claim him for one of our clan.|$|R

40|$|More than 500 {{species of}} marine snails {{comprise}} the genus Conus, {{and all are}} venomous predators. The venom of a typical cone snail contains small post-translationally modified peptides, {{many of which are}} directed towards voltage- and ligand-gated ion channels and receptors with exquisite specificity (Olivera, 1997). A complex mixture of peptide toxins is produced in a long tubular venom duct containing secretory cells. Venom is ultimately discharged into prey by injection through a highly modified radular tooth, resembling a barbed hypodermic needle, which is gripped near the tip of an extensible proboscis. Mechanisms for transferring toxins from the venom duct into the proboscis for injection are not well understood, but in at least one species, C. californicus, peptides appear to be packaged into the radular teeth themselves (Marshall et al., 2002). In the fish-hunting species C. catus, and presumably in other species as well, the radular tooth is explosively propelled in a ballistic fashion into the prey prior to venom expulsion through the tooth (Schulz et al., 2004). Venoms of both C. striatus and C. catus induce an immediate tetanic paralysis of the <b>harpooned</b> <b>fish,</b> thereby enabling prey capture (Kohn, 1956). Isolation of venom peptides from Conus snails {{in the vast majority of}} cases has employed crude venom obtained from dissected venom ducts (duct venom, DV), with material being pooled from multiple animals. The use of DV enables peptide characterization based on conventional analytical and sequencing methods that require fairly large amounts of material. However, it is not clear how peptides in DV are related to those actually injected during prey capture. In severa...|$|R

50|$|The Palikur subsist {{largely on}} bow and arrowfishing, {{supplemented}} by hunting and horticulture. Manioc, roasted, or {{used for the}} preparation of flat cakes and beer, is the main cultivated plant. Sweet potatoes, sugarcane, peppers, gourds, cotton, and papayas, which the Palikur have adopted from the Europeans, along with mangoes, coffee, and citrus trees, are also cultivated. Commercial relations between the Palikur and the Europeans began to intensify in the early 18th century; river and forest products were exchanged for tools, harpoons, clothes and glass beads. Until {{the end of the}} 19th century the main commercial surplus was roasted manioc flour. In the 1940s and 1950s an intense commerce with alligator skins took place, until the alligator population was depleted. The Palikur manufacture objects of wood, bone, feathers, and cotton seed. They are also regionally famous for their basket-ware. Shotguns for hunting and <b>harpoons</b> and cotton <b>fishing</b> lines are being widely used at the present. In French Guiana particularly, a growing number of Palikur are engaging in the market-economy.|$|R

50|$|The oldest {{finds in}} the area of Tsawwassen First Nation settled by means of {{radiocarbon}} dated to about 2260 BC. Other sites such as Whalen Farm and Beach Grove dating back to the presence of Tsawwassen at least until the time of 400-200 BC. The traditional Tsawwassen area ranged in the north east to the area around Pitt Lake, Pitt River to Pitt Meadows down to where the water in the Fraser River flows. It included Burns Bog and parts of New Westminster. From Sea Island to Galiano Island and joined Salt Spring, Pender and Saturna Island. North Eastwards came the Point Roberts Peninsula added, then the area around the Serpentine and Nicomekl River. Like most First Nations people of the West Coast the Tsawwassen lived in family groups and inhabited longhouses. They carved no totem poles but ornate house posts, masks, tools with carvings etc. Also they processed cedar fibers and goat hair into dresses and headgear. Also, the wooden building material, firewood, canoes and dresses. Using tidal traps, <b>fishing,</b> nets and <b>harpoons</b> they hunted <b>fish,</b> especially salmon. They also harvested oysters, crabs and other sea creatures. The salmon was considered a supernatural being, and therefore had to be hunted and eaten in a very particular way. The remains were returned to the sea in a private ceremony. Numerous species of birds were on the menu, such as ducks, loons, to seals and sea lions. Land mammals such as moose, deer, black bear and beaver were hunted seasonally. Also Camassia, Cranberries and medicinal plants were harvested, also traded and exchanged.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper was to analyze fishbones from the Pitted Ware Culture {{settlement}} named Hemmor. in Dalbo, När parish on Gotland. The fishbones are unburnt and derive from one specific culture layer (c: 6) in trench one VI: 7, and radiocarbon dated to 2600 - 2300 BC cal. In this paper I wanted to answer these following questions: 1. What kind of fish species did they eat in Hemmor? 2. How was the different fish species represented in the material? 3. What kind of fishing methods did they use to capture the fish? 4. Was the settlement named Hemmor used through the entire year? The methods I used were both quantitative and qualitative. The identification of the different fish species was made by using modern reference material. All fragments were counted and weighed in order to estimate how the different fish species were represented at the settlement. To estimate season of catch and age, 10 vertebrae of cod was randomly picked out from the material. The fish species represented in the material was : cod, herring, pike, perch, flatfish and whitefish/ salmon. The most common fish species in the material was cod. The fishbone material from Hemmor was compared with three other Neolithic settlements in the Baltic sea region. The results were similar for two of the settlements while one differed some from the others. The fishing methods based on the archeological findings at the excavation site, showed that the people at Hemmor could have used fish-forks, <b>harpoons,</b> fishhook sand <b>fishing</b> nets. The fish species in the material indicate that the Hemmor settlement was probably used throughout the year, which also was indicated from the 10 vertebrae of cod, since it was caught during both summer and winter. Some of the other fishes indicated that the people in Hemmor also fished during the spring and fall...|$|R
