5|$|Following a fall in game {{attendance}} in 2009 and 2010, Start decided {{ahead of the}} 2011 season to reduce the stadium's capacity.

Long interested <b>in</b> <b>municipal</b> affairs, he entered civic politics with his election to the Edmonton Town Council in 1903. After an aldermanic term that saw the inclusion of Alberta as a province in Canada, in 1905 he was elected as mayor of the newly incorporated city; during his term he would oversee many improvements and advances to the city. Retiring after one term in office and returning to his contracting firm, he would eventually leave Edmonton in 1922 for Vancouver where he would live for 10 years leading up to his death in 1932. An active community man, May also founded and oversaw many local organizations. A Liberal in politics, he is remembered as a progressive mayor whose policies helped the accelerate development of city of Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|Progressive {{politics}} {{have been particularly}} strong <b>in</b> <b>municipal</b> government since the 1960s. Voters approved charter amendments that have lessened the penalties for possession of marijuana (1974), and that aim to protect access to abortion in the city should it ever become illegal in the State of Michigan (1990). In 1974, Kathy Kozachenko's victory in an Ann Arbor city-council race made her the country's first openly homosexual candidate to win public office. In 1975, Ann Arbor became the first U.S. city to use instant-runoff voting for a mayoral race. Adopted through a ballot initiative sponsored by the local Human Rights Party, which feared a splintering of the liberal vote, the process was repealed in 1976 after use in only one election. As of May 2016, Democrats hold the mayorship and nine out of the ten council seats. Nationally, Ann Arbor is located in Michigan's 12th congressional district, represented by Democrat Debbie Dingell.|$|E

5|$|Under the Municipal Corporations Act of 1882 {{some women}} were {{qualified}} to vote <b>in</b> <b>municipal</b> elections, but {{were excluded from}} serving as councillors. However, the Local Government Act of 1888, which created county councils, was interpreted by some as allowing women's election to these new bodies. On 17 November 1888 a group of Liberal women decided to test the legal position. They formed the Society for Promoting the Return of Women as County Councillors (SPRWCC), established an election fund of £400 and selected two women—Jane Cobden and Margaret Sandhurst— as Liberal candidates for the newly created London County Council. Cobden {{was adopted by the}} party's Bow and Bromley division, and Sandhurst by Brixton. Despite objections from the Conservatives, the women's nominations were accepted by the local returning officers. Cobden's campaign in Bow and Bromley was organised with considerable enthusiasm and efficiency by the 29-year-old George Lansbury, then a Radical Liberal, later a socialist and eventually leader of the Labour Party. Both Cobden and Sandhurst were victorious in the elections on 19 January 1889; they were joined by Emma Cons, whom the Progressive majority on the council selected to serve as an alderman.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{establish}} whether the use of information technology (IT) by elected municipal representatives, for constituency work, emboldens the adoption of e-service <b>in</b> <b>municipals</b> of a developing country. The research data was obtained through the completion of a questionnaire by a sample of respondents who serve as authorities of IT <b>in</b> South African <b>municipals.</b> The findings from both descriptive and inferential data analysis of collected data confirm that the use of IT by elected municipal representatives for constituency work impacts the adoption of e-service <b>in</b> <b>municipals.</b> Furthermore, the use of IT by elected municipal representatives for constituency work correlated with both e-service laws and e-service security. This study contributes to a better understanding of choices needed when planning for the adoption of e-service initiatives <b>in</b> <b>municipals</b> of developing countries. Given that 87. 2 % of respondents are aware of a high access to telephone mobile, a further research is needed to clarify why most elected municipal representatives of a developing country choose not to exploit IT for their constituency work, and similarly why municipals of a developing country do not exploit IT to provide services...|$|R
