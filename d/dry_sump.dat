5|$|TWR had {{manufactured}} {{a number}} of these racing V12 engines during the 1980s and they had been raced competitively, with a 7-litre version of this engine featuring in the Le Mans winning Silk Cut Jaguar XJR-9. Five of these engines still existed, all of which were fitted with <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> lubrication. These engines were chosen and considered to be especially useful as the <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> would lower the vehicle's centre of gravity. The displacement of the V12 was set at 6.2 litres (6222cc) for the XJ220. The engine fitted to the XJ220 concept had titanium connecting rods.|$|E
25|$|Integrated <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> {{in all but}} GT3, GT3 RS, GT2 and Turbo {{versions}} {{which have}} a <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> with external oil reservoir and 7 pumps instead of only 3 in the less powerful versions.|$|E
25|$|Integrated dry-sump is Porsche's {{name for}} a <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> {{lubrication}} system integrated within the engine block, i.e. no separate oil reservoir.|$|E
50|$|Because of the <b>dry</b> <b>sump's</b> {{external}} oil reservoir, {{excess air}} can escape the oil before {{the oil is}} pumped back through the engine. <b>Dry</b> <b>sumps</b> also allow for more power because they {{reduce the amount of}} windage, oil sloshing up into the rotating assembly, and the vacuum from the scavenge pump improves ring seal. <b>Dry</b> <b>sumps</b> are more popular in racing applications because of the improved power and reduced oil sloshing that would otherwise reduce oil pressure. Disadvantages of <b>dry</b> <b>sumps</b> are increased weight, additional parts, and more chances for leaks and problems to occur.|$|R
50|$|Class 11 {{vehicles}} {{typically have}} 60-80 horsepower. Single Carburated, dual or single port. Electronic ignitions are allowed. No <b>dry</b> <b>sumps.</b> Larger oil pumps may be installed, and external coolers as well.|$|R
50|$|Four-stroke engines, as {{for almost}} all cars, and large {{two-stroke}} engines used in locomotives and ships can both use either wet or <b>dry</b> <b>sumps.</b> Large two-stroke engines do not use crankcase compression; instead they use a separate blower or supercharger, either a mechanical blower such as a Roots blower or else a turbocharger.|$|R

25|$|By {{the end of}} 1980, Lotus was {{building}} three different models of Esprit with distinct chassis designs and body moulds - the Domestic (i.e. UK) S2.2, the Export S2.2, and the <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> Turbo Esprit.|$|E
25|$|Further {{details of}} the engine were {{revealed}} on 7 October 2015 as being based on the Ford Coyote 5.0L V8 with modifications by Cosworth including lighter flywheel, <b>dry</b> <b>sump</b> and unique engine management to generate from 450 to beyond 500 bhp depending on the variant.|$|E
50|$|It was a {{tall order}} to boost each engine from 125 hp to six times that output: laid on their sides and fitted with <b>dry</b> <b>sumps,</b> each four-cylinder, 5 litre engine ran at 6 bar boost, with {{intercooling}} and water injection; soon they were giving 600 hp. A number of bespoke components were required, including a solid billet crankshaft, competition fuel injectors and pistons and modified cam profiles.|$|R
50|$|The C75 was the 305cc {{version of}} the C70. It had a square head-light and shock absorbers, leading link forks, pressed-steel {{handlebars}} and were somewhat unusual in appearance. The engine was <b>dry</b> <b>sumped,</b> and had six-volt electrics. The design of both the frame and engine was heavily influenced by bikes built by NSU Motorenwerke AG, which Soichiro Honda had seen on his visit to Europe in 1955, including the Isle of Man TT races.|$|R

5000|$|In 1966, Team Lotus {{registered}} {{new cars}} for the British Saloon Car Championship, {{which was now}} open to Group 5 Special Touring Cars, as regulations had been changed.

The cars also had the MacPherson struts replaced with coil springs and shock absorbers and a revised wishbone geometry. They scored 8 class wins, many driven by Jim Clark. In the European Touring Car Challenge, Sir John Whitmore scored another four wins, not enough to give him the title, being beaten by Alfa Romeo Giulia GTAs.|$|R

2500|$|Taking {{cues from}} Brabham's Formula One special, and through {{evolution}} of the Formula Three curved tube chassis design, Maddock produced a new Formula Two design for 1956: the Cooper T41. He developed this the subsequent year into the Mark II, or Cooper T43, model. Where the 1956 car had been developed for Climax's FWB, this 1957 car was intended for Climax's new FPF four-cylinder engine. While the FWB was a development of a pump engine adapted for automobile use, the FPF was a bespoke, <b>dry</b> <b>sumped</b> racing design. Even in [...] Formula Two form Maddock's lightweight cars could produce strong performances against more powerful machinery, but the true potential of the design was shown when Rob Walker Racing decided to build a T43 with an enlarged 1964 cc FPF engine – and the works entered it for the 1957 Monaco Grand Prix. Driver Jack Brabham unfortunately managed to write the chassis off in practice, but the engine was transferred to another T43 present for the Formula Two race and Brabham managed to qualify 13th for the 16 car race. In the race itself Brabham climbed as high as third place, behind the Maserati 250F of Juan Manuel Fangio and the Vanwall of Tony Brooks, before the little car's fuel pump failed on its 100th lap. Determined to finish Brabham pushed the car from the tunnel, the full distance of the Monaco marina, to the finish line. He was sixth, only one place out of the points, but better was to come.|$|R
2500|$|Military {{operations}} {{in the early years}} at Otis AFB included the use of petroleum products and other hazardous materials such as fuels, motor oils, and cleaning solvents and the generation of associated wastes. Consistent with practices of other industries at the time, it was common practice for many years to dispose of such wastes in landfills, <b>dry</b> wells, <b>sumps,</b> and the sewage treatment plant. Spills and leaks also occurred. [...] These activities have resulted in serious impacts to the Upper Cape’s groundwater resources. [...] As {{a direct result of the}} threats from waste plumes in the groundwater, much of the water supply in the surrounding area was converted from wells to municipal water sources.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, the MMR {{created the}} Massachusetts Military Reservation Energy Committee {{to find ways}} of {{reducing}} the base’s carbon footprint and operational costs by using renewable energy technologies. This was largely because, in the past, the Joint Base Cape Cod has used a very large amount of “petroleum products and other hazardous materials and disposed of them in nearby landfills, <b>dry</b> wells, <b>sumps,</b> and a sewage treatment plant.” [...] Recently, in 2008, treatment systems created to remedy the polluted area were reported by this committee to not only have in turn created a tremendous spike in electricity costs, but to also having caused an increase in greenhouse gas emissions due to the extra amount of fossil fuels needing to be burned for these remedial treatment plants.Therefore, the Massachusetts Military Reservation Wind Project was proposed for the government owned Joint Base Cape Cod. Once the first wind turbine was built in 2009 and the beneficial impacts on the area were proven, the contracting company that built the first turbine, ECC Corporate, was given the funds in 2010 to build two other turbines, finished in 2011. The total cost of the project was about $16.2 million. The project is still not over, however, as there is a possibility for more wind turbines to be built in the future. This possibility is expanded upon in the “New Turbines” section.|$|R
