40|$|Objective Hyperhomocysteinemia {{has been}} {{reported}} to be independent risk factor for myocardial infarction and death in coronary artry disease in abroad. To investigate the clinical signficance of plasma homocysteine in Japanese sudden cardiac death, we assussud its levels in cardiopulmonary arrest victims caused by cardiac etiology. Methods Plasma homocysteine was determined by a high-performance liquid chromatograph with a fluorometric detector. Patients Homocysteine was <b>determned</b> by a cardiopulmonary arrest (CPA) victims and in 104 healthy ccontrol subjects. The CPA patients were classified in the three groups based on the etiology, I. e., cardigenic, noncardiogenic (such as bronchial asthma and subarachnoid hemorrhage), or accidental (such as asphyxia and hanging) CPA group. Results Plasma homocysteine in cardiogenic CPA patients was higher than that in noncardiogenic and accidental CPA patients, or in healthy control subjects. Plasma homocysteine in healthy men was higher than that in healthy women. Additionaly, homcysteine levels decreased progressively with age in healthy subjects (p＜ 0. 05). Conclusion These results demonstrated that high plasma homocysteine is a significant risk factor for sudden cardiac death and that a warning is inevitable for male younger generation in japanese...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} thesis {{presents an}} analysis of the torsional loads on V-band clamps. In some applications, the relative rotational movement of the flanges connected by V-band clamps can result in catastrophic system failure. The ability to understand the factors impacting on torsional load capacity is therefore essential. In this research project, a theoretical model of a V-band joint subjected to torsional loads was developed. This model is used to identify those parameters that will impact on the joint’s reliability. An experimental investigation was conducted to validate a theoretical model using a newly developed test rig. The development and features of this test rig are presented in this report. This experimental investigation also allowed the impact of those parameters that are difficult to control, to be determined. A total of three V-bands were used with different diameters but nominally identical cross sections were studied. In the research results, the initial slip point between flanges and the V-band clamp was identified by experimentation within this research project. Different sizes of Vbands were used under boundary conditions and loads. From the simulation results it was <b>determned</b> that the friction effect on the V-band depends {{on the size of the}} V-band. For the largest size of V-band, there was moderate correlation of the experimental and theoretical results. For the smallest size, the results suggest that with band tightening, flange contact is localised, rather than being throughout the band’s entire circumference. The research demonstrated the significant relevance of the band and flanges’ contact points and the coefficient of friction, especially that between the flanges, on the V-band clamp’s theoretical torsional load capacit...|$|E

40|$|This {{work was}} carried out aiming at {{studying}} at the light microscope the diagonal artery of the pig's heart to analyse {{the composition of the}} arterial wall and the morphometry of its tunicas as well. The hearts of twelve pigs of both sexs were used. From those 12 hearts, six had diagonal artery and other six tacked it. From those with the artery 18 blocks of 1 cm² were removed from the intimal segment of the arteries, six blocks bling form the diagonal artery, six from the anterior interventricular arteries and six from the circunflex arteries. From another 6 hearts without diagonal artery 12 blocks of the 1 cm² were removed, six blocks bling from the anterior interventricular arteries and six from the circunflex arteries. In each arterial segment 20 µm thick histological sections were made. The laminal obtained were stained by the following methods: resorcine-fucsine of Weigert counter-stained with picrofucsine of van Gieson; method of Verhoef; method of Azan. It was observed that the diagonal arteries belonged to the groups of muscular, or medium diameter arteries. As for the histomorphometric analysis, considering the tickness of the wall of the anterior interventricular, circunflex and diagonal arteries, it was observed that a larger thickness occured at the epicardial wall, followed by the miocardial wall. It was demonstrated a larger wall in the anterior interventricular artery, followed by the circunflex and then the diagonal arteries. Comparing the mean thickness of the wall of the anterior interventricular artery in the hearts with or without diagonal artery, it was observed that in the former it was thinner than in the latter. This finding was also made for the mean thickness of the wall of the circunflex artery in the hearts with ou without diagonal artery, showing that presence of the diagonal artery <b>determns</b> a change in the initial thicness of the walls of the two arteries Se realizó este trabajo con el objetivo de estudiar al microscopio la luz de la arteria diagonal en los corazones de los suinos para analizar la constitución de la pared arterial y la morfometria de las túnicas. Se utilizaron 12 corazones de suinos, de ellos 6 poseían la arteria diagonal mientras que en otros 6 corazones el referido vaso no estaba presente. De los corazones con arteria diagonal, se obtuvieron 18 bloques de 1 cm² del seguimiento inicial de las arterias, siendo 6 de arterias diagonales, 6 de arterias interventriculares anteriores y 6 de arterias circunflejas. De los otros 6 corazones sin arteria diagonal fueron retirados 12 bloques de 1 cm², 6 del seguimiento inicial de las arterias interventriculares anteriores y 6 del seguimiento inicial de las arterias circunflejas. Estas piezas fueron sometidas a rutinas histológicas obteniéndose cortes transversales y logintudinales de 20 µm de grosor. Las láminas obtenidas fueron teñidas por los métodos de Weigert - Van Gieson, Verhoef y Azan. La arteria diagonal del corazón del suino puede ser clasificada como una arteria muscular; siendo posible diferenciar las tres túnicas. De éstas, la túnica media es la más diferenciada; mostrando mayor grosor la pared de la arteria interventricular anterior, seguida de la arteria circunfleja y, finalmente, de la diagonal; en todas las arterias (IVA, circunfleja y diagonal) se observó que la pared miocárdica era la más fina, comparada con la epicárdica. Se concluye que la longitud del vaso influye en el grosor de la pared. Cuanto mayor es la extensión del vaso, mayor el grosor inicial de la pared y que la presencia de la arteria diagonal determina un menor grosor de la pared de las arterias IVA y circunfleja, comparadas a los corazones que no presentan arteria diagona...|$|R
40|$|Gamma hydroxybutyric acid (GHB) {{is present}} in blood and urine of the general {{population}} as an endogenous compound. The published concentrations in postmortem blood ranged from 0 - 168 mg/L in cases with no previous history of GHB use. Interpretation of GHB results should be carefully considered due to the wide distribution of endogenous concentrations. The objectives of this study are to evaluate and verify the accuracy of a proposed published (50 mg/L) cut-off in 120 blood and 64 urine samples in postmortem cases selected randomly, and to identify GHB-related fatalities. GHB was <b>determned</b> by gas chromatography– mass spectrometry (GC–MS) after extraction of the blood and urine {{in the presence of the}} internal standard GHB-D 6. The GHB concentration in majority of the blood samples (95 %) was ≤ 50 mg/L, while in 81 % it ranged from 10 - 50 mg/L. In 95 % of the urine samples, the GHB concentration ranged from 10 - 20 mg/L while 82 % of the samples had a concentration of 500 mg/L. The proposed published GHB concentration of 50 mg/L may be used as a cut-off to distinguish between natural endogenous concentrations and exogenous use, but this is not sufficient by itself. The detected GHB concentrations, both in vivo and in postmortem samples, require careful interpretation, not only due to its endogenous nature, but also due to the possibility of postmortem production and also due to its rapid metabolism and excretion. In order to distinguish the endogenous GHB concentration from those reflecting abusive GHB levels, defining a specific cut-off value in biological samples is very crucial. Other matrices, such as vitreous humour, femoral blood and hair must also be considered when interpreting postmortem GHB concentrations...|$|E
