2500|$|The other {{change in}} 1970 was {{the switch to}} the [...] "dog-leg" [...] heads. These heads flow 20% better on the exhaust side than the 1966-'69 {{rectangle}} port heads and are thus the best for performance. There are two reasons for the flow increase: First, {{the area of the}} port is larger, due to the <b>dog</b> <b>leg.</b> Second, the shape of the port floor was changed from a concave to a convex curve. The concave floor tended to bend the exhaust flow upwards which caused turbulence when the flow was forced to go down into the exhaust manifolds. By switching to a convex floor the curvature of the flow starts in the head and proceeds much more smoothly into the exhaust manifold resulting in less turbulence and better flow.|$|E

The heights are bounded by Bourgeois Fjord to the north and west, <b>Dogs</b> <b>Leg</b> Fjord to the south, and to the east by a glacier draining both northwards into Bourgeois Fjord and southwards into <b>Dogs</b> <b>Leg</b> Fjord.|$|R
50|$|Humans usually {{walk with}} {{the soles of}} their feet on the ground, in {{plantigrade}} locomotion. In contrast, digitigrade animals walk on their distal and intermediate phalanges. Digitigrade locomotion {{is responsible for the}} distinctive hooked shape of <b>dog</b> <b>legs.</b>|$|R

50|$|The A14 commences at the {{intersection}} of Marion Road and South Road. It travels north for the entire length of Marion Road. At Henley Beach Road, it takes a <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> to the west on Henley Beach Road for about 250 metres, and then continues north along the entire length of Holbrooks Road. At Grange Road it take a 50-metre <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> to the east, and then continues north along the entire length of East Avenue until it terminates at Port Road.|$|E

50|$|Heitzmann is {{credited}} {{for being the}} first physician to describe the precursor corpuscles of red cells, structures that he referred to as hematoblasts. In 1872 he documented his findings in a treatise titled Studien am Knochen und Knorpel, in which he mentions that his discovery of the hematoblast was in the bone marrow of an injured <b>dog's</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|R
50|$|It has a <b>dog's</b> <b>leg</b> shape, {{typical of}} the layout of early Eighteenth Dynasty tombs, but several {{features}} make this tomb stand out. The burial chamber is a rectangular shape and divided into upper and lower pillared sections, with the lower part holding the sarcophagus of the king. This style of burial chamber became 'standard' for royal burials in the later New Kingdom.|$|R

The corridor to the Brookes Street wing opens to the vehicle laneway and the corridor to the Wickham Street wing terminates at a secondary <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> timber stair.

5000|$|The fourteenth hole {{is a long}} <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> left par four. The creek {{that runs}} from hole {{thirteen}} runs on the entire left side of this hole. The fairway is wide open except for the creek. The <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> left corner is capable of being cut if the drive is high enough to clear the out of bounds trees. There is a sand trap on the right front side of the green and on the entire {{left side of the}} green. The beginning of the green is very skinny and elevated. The green then slopes down and left to a wide area of the green. Any flag placement causes tough putting and approach shots.|$|E

50|$|<b>Dogs</b> <b>Leg</b> Fjord is an inlet 6 nmi km long in an east-west {{direction}} and 1.5 nmi km wide, lying south of German Peninsula, directly east of Ridge Island and opening on Bourgeois Fjord, along the Fallières Coast {{on the west}} side of Graham Land, Antarctica. It was discovered by the British Graham Land Expedition, 1934-37, under John Rymill, and so named because of its shape.|$|R
50|$|The {{building}} has a <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> stair, rising from a ground floor hall off the Logan Road entrance, {{in which a}} plaster archway supported on reeded piers separates the stairwell from the entrance. The stair features turned and moulded newels, surmounted by globular finials, and turned balusters.|$|E
50|$|With two {{separate}} greens, this hole features a fascinating strategy contrast. When the pin {{is on the}} left green, a monster bunker protects the hole and the player will need to fight through dense rough. The right green is open, but has a long right <b>dog</b> <b>leg.</b>|$|E
50|$|The <b>dog</b> <b>leg</b> gearbox is also {{typical of}} nine- and ten-speed heavy-truck transmissions.

5000|$|There is {{potential}} for confusion as [...] "dog tensioners" [...] are levers that are named {{due to the}} shape of the lever appearing as a <b>dog</b> <b>leg,</b> as the lever is in a pantograph arrangement, or [...] "dog trailers", which are named due to the use of multiple trailers for transporting animal cages.|$|E

50|$|A dog-leg gearbox is {{a manual}} {{transmission}} shift pattern distinguished by an up-over-up shift between {{first and second}} gear. The layout derives its name from a dog's hind leg, with its sharp angles. <b>Dog</b> <b>leg</b> gearboxes have fallen out of fashion primarily because most manual performance cars now have six-speed gearboxes, which are unsuited to the dog-leg layout.|$|E

5000|$|In particular, {{an object}} should avoid invoking methods {{of a member}} object {{returned}} by another method. For many modern object oriented languages that use a dot as field identifier, the law can be stated simply as [...] "use only one dot". That is, the code [...] breaks the law where [...] does not. As an analogy, when one wants a dog to walk, one does not command the <b>dog's</b> <b>legs</b> to walk directly; instead one commands the dog which then commands its own legs.|$|R

30|$|Menand, Sellami, and Bouguecha (2009) {{considered}} {{axial force}} transfer {{as an issue}} in deviated wells where friction and buckling phenomenon take place. The general perception of the industry is that once the drill pipe exceeds conventional buckling criteria, axial force cannot be transferred down-hole anymore. Their study showed that, even though buckling criteria are exceeded, axial force transfer could be still good if drill pipe is in rotation. They showed and explained how axial force is transferred down-hole in many simulated field conditions: sliding, rotating, with or without <b>dog</b> <b>legs</b> (Stephan et al. 2009).|$|R
