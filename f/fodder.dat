40|$|The {{authors of}} this work {{proposed}} an experiment on rearing two valuable fish species(Cyprinus carpio and Polyodon spathula) in intensive system, using non-conventional <b>fodders</b> (sunflowergroats and rice bran) - first variant (I) and mixed/conventional <b>fodders</b> (fine grained) – second variant(II) (using as control). It is expected, that testing the <b>fodders</b> to obtain the best effect in the optimizationof the performances in rearing the target fish species. The experiment {{has taken place in}} conditions of anintensive system in ground ponds (pond no 8 - HC 8 and pond no 9 - HC 9), at the Nucet Fish Farm(Experimental Base), with the two experimental feeding variants: I. feeding the material with non conventionalfodders (30 % protein) in HC 8, and II. feeding the material with mixed <b>fodders</b> (24. 86 %crude protein) in HC 9. Taking into consideration the almost identical environmental conditions and thepopulation density the rearing of the fish depends on additional food given and its quality. Following theperformed investigation we can appreciate that, the feeding with non-conventional <b>fodders</b> in intensiveand semi-intensive rearing systems, in ponds, can provide the energy and complete range of essentialnutrients for the combined culture of common carps and P. spathula. Using good quality stockingbiological material (obtained in summer I), a “cheap formula” for feeding, a good quality and volume ofwater, it is possible to get fish that can be delivered on the market at the required dimensions next year. Taking into account the obtained production using conventional and non-conventional <b>fodders</b> and havingin view their price, we can conclude that <b>fodders</b> from the aquaculture market can be successfullyreplaced with non-conventional ones, which have a more affordable price, resulting in a lower cost perkilogram of fish in the case of mixed culture C. carpio and P. spathula...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors have}} set forth an {{experiment}} on breeding the Cyprinus carpio species in high densities, in small spaces, because thisis the traditional species of Romanian pisciculture {{and the most}} valuable species from the economic point of view, by using mixedfodders (like farinaceous type) and grained type. The two variants of our experiment performed at C. C. D. P. - Nucet, were carried out in two ground basins each of 1000 m². The first variant consisted on feeding the fishy material with mixed <b>fodders,</b> with 24 % gross protein; the second variant consisted on feeding the fishy material with grained <b>fodders</b> ALLER CLASIC 3 mm, with 30 % gross protein. Taking into account the identical conditions of the life environment and the high densities of population, the breeding of fishymaterial depends only on the additional food administrated {{in terms of its}} qualities, obtaining thus the following results: variant I– the basin was populated with 3000 exemplaries resulting in a production of 2692 Kg, with a consumption of mixed <b>fodders</b> of 5000 Kg; variant II – the basin was populated with 3000 exemplaries, obtaining a production of 3652 Kg, for a consumption of grained <b>fodders</b> of 6000 Kg...|$|R

5|$|The game {{retained}} the mechanics and gameplay of its predecessor but introduced new levels, settings and graphics. Former journalist Stuart Campbell designed the game's levels, making them harder and more tactically demanding, {{as well as}} introducing a multitude of pop culture references in the level titles. The development of the game's plot was hampered by budget constraints and the resulting lack of explanation confused reviewers. Critics enjoyed the gameplay retained from the original Cannon <b>Fodder</b> but were disappointed {{at the lack of}} new mechanics or weapons, comparing the game to a data disk. Reviewers praised the game's level design, though less so those of its alien planet. Critics gave Cannon <b>Fodder</b> 2 positive reviews but lower scores than its predecessor and gave mixed criticism of the new theme music and increased difficulty.|$|E

40|$|Aim: To {{evaluate}} some forage feeds of ruminants {{in terms}} of their carbohydrate (CHO) and protein fractions using Cornell Net Carbohydrate and Protein System (CNCPS). Materials and Methods: Eleven ruminant feeds (six green <b>fodders</b> - maize, oat, sorghum, bajra, cowpea, berseem and five range herbages - para grass, guinea grass, hedge lucerne, setaria grass and hybrid napier) were selected for this study. Each feed was chemically analyzed for proximate principles (dry matter, crude protein [CP], ether extract, organic matter and ash), fiber fractions (neutral detergent fiber, acid detergent fiber, acid detergent lignin, cellulose and hemicellulose), primary CHO fractions (CHO, non-structural CHO, structural CHO and starch) and primary protein fractions (neutral detergent insoluble CP, acid detergent insoluble CP, non-protein nitrogen and soluble protein). The results were fitted to the equations of CNCPS to arrive at various CHO (CA - fast degrading, CB 1 - intermediate degrading, CB 2 - slow degrading and CC - nondegrading or unavailable) and protein (PA - instantaneously degrading, PB 1 - fast degrading, PB 2 - intermediate degrading, PB 3 - slow degrading and PC - non-degrading or unavailable) fractions of test feeds. Results: Among green <b>fodders,</b> cowpea and berseem had higher CA content while except hedge lucerne all range herbages had lower CA values. CB 1 content of all feeds was low but similar. All feeds except cowpea, berseem, and hedge lucerne contained higher CB 2 values. Oat among green <b>fodders</b> and hybrid napier among range herbages had lower CC fraction. Feeds such as bajra, cowpea, berseem and the setaria grass contained lower PA fraction. All green <b>fodders</b> had higher PB 1 content except maize and cowpea while all range herbages had lower PB 1 values except hedge lucerne. Para grass and hybrid napier contained exceptionally low PB 2 fraction among all feeds. Low PC contents were reported in oat and berseem <b>fodders.</b> Conclusion: Based on our findings, it was concluded that feeds with similar CP and CHO content varied significantly with respect to their CHO and protein fractions. Due to lower CC fraction, oat and hybrid napier were superior feeds {{in terms of}} CHO supply to ruminants. Similarly, among all feeds oat and berseem had a lower PC fraction, thus were considered good sources of protein for ruminants...|$|R

5|$|Feeding horses {{was a major}} issue, {{and horse}} <b>fodder</b> was the single largest {{commodity}} shipped to the front by some countries, including Britain. Horses ate around ten times as much food by weight as a human, and hay and oats further burdened already overloaded transport services. In 1917, Allied operations were threatened when horse feed rations were reduced after German submarine activity restricted supplies of oats from North America, combined with poor Italian harvests. The British rationed hay and oats, although their horses were still issued more than those from France or Italy. The Germans faced an even worse <b>fodder</b> crisis, as they had underestimated {{the amount of food}} they needed to import and stockpile before the beginning of the war.

40|$|Abstract: Animal {{production}} in Botswana suffers from inadequate feed quantities and qualities, due mainly to semi-arid low rainfall which can barely support arable farming in most years. This problem {{is compounded by}} the competition between the livestock and human feed industries for the little available pulses and cereals. Consequently, tree <b>fodders</b> are available forage resources which grazing herbivores can utilize without competition from monogastric animals and man. Tree <b>fodders</b> can be utilized as supplements to low quality grasses and straws. Most tree leaves and twigs contain tannins, an antinutritional factor for which proper precautions need to be taken in selecting the species of trees and their level of feeding to grazing animals. Many plant components have the potential to precipitate adverse effects on the productivity of farm livestock. Plant anti-nutritive factors may be divided into a heat-labile group, comprising lectins, proteinase inhibitors and cyanogens, which are sensitive to standard processing temperatures and a heat-stable group including, among many others, antigenic proteins, condensed tannins, saponins, the non-protein amino acids and mimosine. These compounds are present in the foliage and/or seeds of virtually every plant that is used in practical feeding. Processing can be used to destroy some anti nutrient factors, also rumen digestion reduces the impart of anti-nutritive factors in some tree <b>fodders</b> for cattle, sheep and goats.
