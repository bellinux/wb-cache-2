40|$|Objectives—The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of theoretically important dimensions of stability and change in economic hardship during early middle years on decade-long health problems of <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> Method—The study used prospective data collected from 360 middle-aged <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> during a 12 -year period. The variables included self-reported economic hardship (22 items), mental and physical health, and physical impairment. Results—The results supported the hypothesis that the dynamics of family economic hardship (in terms of stability and change) during the early middle years contribute to subsequent onset of health problems of middle-aged <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> These health problems, in turn, progress as an interrelated process through intra-health-domain continuities, cross-health-domain proliferations and dyadic associations as they pass through midlife. Discussion—A better understanding these processes may aid in the formation and effective implementation of mental and physical health promotion programs for middle-aged <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the effects of v assertive training on the marital adjustment of tho se participating. It was of particular interest to identify the effects of training wives only as compared to training couples jointly in assertiveness. There were a total of 56 subjects sampled for this study, constituting 28 marriages, all investigated for marital adjustment. All of the subjects were volunteers and were obtained through the Women 2 ̆ 7 s Center at Utah State University. The subjects were placed in one of two treatment conditions depending upon the condition for which they volunteered. The wives only treatment condition provided assertiveness training exclusively for the wives of the couples participating. Both <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> received training in the couples treatment condition. All of the 56 subjects, both <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives,</b> completed the Marital-Adjustment Test during the first and last session of assertive training. The assertive training groups met for six weeks for two hours each week. An analysis of covariance was used to analyze the data for the first two hypotheses. The pretest scores for both treatment conditions for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> were held constant and the posttest scores on the Marital-Adjustment Test were compared for both <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> of the other treatment condition. The f test for significant differences in correlations was used to test the following questions: (a) Is there a difference in the amount of correlation of the pretest scores and the posttest scores on the Marital-Adjustment Test for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in the wives only treatment condition? and (b) Is there a difference in the amount of correlation of the pretest scores and the posttest scores on the Marital-Adjustment Test for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in the couples treatment condition? It may be concluded that there is no advantage for marital adjustment when <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> are both given assertiveness training as opposed to the wife only receiving training. There was a statistical difference (beyond the. 01 level of significance) between the correlations of the pretest and posttest scores for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in the wives only treatment condition. No difference in amount of correlation was found between pretest and posttest scores on the Marital-Adjustment Test for <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> in the couples treatment condition. It was concluded that when spouses were trained together, no change in perceptions of marital adjustment occurred. When wives were trained alone, perceptions of marital adjustment between spouses was in greater agreement. No evidence was found that marital adjustment was affected by teaching assertion skills to the wife only as opposed to teaching the couple...|$|R

40|$|In Brazil, wives {{do most of}} the {{household}} work. About sixty percent of them also work outside {{the household}}, working a total of about 10 hours more per week than men. Because of this unequal distribution of household work, <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> might have different priorities regarding the purchase of durable goods. Although both <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> enjoy entertainment durable goods, wives might have a relative preference for household-production durable goods such as washing machines over entertainment durable goods such as televisions. Using a Brazilian household consumption survey, we examine whether decisions about ownership of entertainment and production durable goods are the outcomes of a bargaining process between <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives.</b> We use several variables to measure bargaining power, including the ratio of women to men in a state. The results indicate that decisions about durable goods ownership are the outcomes of bargaining processes between <b>husbands</b> <b>and</b> <b>wives</b> with wives having a relative preference for household-production durable goods over entertainment durable goods compared to their husbands. Bargaining might explain why ownership of household production durable goods is relatively low in Brazil, despite their potential to save women's time...|$|R
