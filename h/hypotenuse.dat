5|$|A {{triangular}} banner {{appearing to}} depict a bird (possibly a raven) appears on a penny minted by Olaf Cuaran around 940. The coin features a roughly right isosceles triangular standard, {{with the two}} equilateral sides situated {{at the top and}} staff, respectively. Along the <b>hypotenuse</b> are a series of five tabs or tassels. The staff is topped by {{what appears to be a}} cross; this may indicate a fusion of pagan and Christian symbolism.|$|E
5|$|This tiling {{is called}} the Pythagorean tiling {{because it has been}} used as the basis of proofs of the Pythagorean theorem by the ninth-century Arabic {{mathematician}}s Al-Nayrizi and Thābit ibn Qurra, and by the 19th-century British amateur mathematician Henry Perigal. If the sides of the two squares forming the tiling are the numbers a and b, then the closest distance between corresponding points on congruent squares is c, where c is the length of the <b>hypotenuse</b> of a right triangle having sides a and b. For instance, in the illustration to the left, the two squares in the Pythagorean tiling have side lengths 5 and 12 units long, and the side length of the tiles in the overlaying square tiling is 13, based on the Pythagorean triple (5,12,13).|$|E
25|$|The <b>hypotenuse</b> is {{the side}} {{opposite}} the right angle, {{in this case}} side. The <b>hypotenuse</b> is always the longest side of a right-angled triangle.|$|E
25|$|For each {{natural number}} n, there exist n Pythagorean triples with {{different}} <b>hypotenuses</b> {{and the same}} area.|$|R

25|$|Hypotenuse-Leg (HL) Theorem: The <b>hypotenuse</b> {{and a leg}} in a right {{triangle}} have the same length as those in another {{right triangle}}. This is also called RHS (right-angle, <b>hypotenuse,</b> side).|$|E
25|$|Recall {{that the}} square of an even number is even and {{the square of}} an odd number is odd. So if {{the square of the}} <b>hypotenuse</b> is even the <b>hypotenuse</b> is even as well.|$|E
25|$|There exist {{infinitely}} many primitive Pythagorean triples {{in which}} the <b>hypotenuse</b> and the longer of the two legs differ by exactly two.

5000|$|RHS (Right-angle-Hypotenuse-Side), {{also known}} as HL (Hypotenuse-Leg): If two right-angled triangles have their <b>hypotenuses</b> equal in length, {{and a pair of}} shorter sides are equal in length, then the triangles are congruent.|$|R

25|$|Typically, a pinion-operated rack moving {{parallel}} to the (trig.-defined) opposite side would position a slide with a slot coincident with the <b>hypotenuse.</b> A pivot on the rack let the slide's angle change freely. At {{the other end of}} the slide (the angle, in trig, terms), a block on a pin fixed to the frame defined the vertex between the <b>hypotenuse</b> and the adjacent side.|$|E

25|$|Multiplication {{was done}} by {{mechanisms}} based on the geometry of similar right triangles. Using the trigonometric terms for a right triangle, specifically opposite, adjacent, and <b>hypotenuse,</b> the adjacent side was fixed by construction. One variable changed {{the magnitude of the}} opposite side. In many cases, this variable changed sign; the <b>hypotenuse</b> could coincide with the adjacent side (a zero input), or move beyond the adjacent side, representing a sign change.|$|E
50|$|In 1958, Erich Teuffel {{proved that}} no two <b>hypotenuses</b> will ever coincide, {{regardless}} of how far the spiral is continued. Also, if the sides of unit length are extended into a line, they will never pass through {{any of the other}} vertices of the total figure.|$|R

50|$|Now {{consider}} a point D {{of the circle}} C. Since C lies in P, so does D. On the other hand, the triangles AOE and DOE are right triangles with a common side, OE, and legs EA and ED equal. Therefore, the <b>hypotenuses</b> AO and DO are equal, and equal to the radius of S, so that D lies in S. This proves that C is contained in the intersection of P and S.|$|R
25|$|For each {{natural number}} n, there exist at least n {{different}} Pythagorean triples {{with the same}} <b>hypotenuse.</b>|$|E

25|$|There exist {{infinitely}} many Pythagorean triples {{in which}} the <b>hypotenuse</b> and the longer of the two legs differ by exactly one (such triples are necessarily primitive). One method to generate such triples is the relation (2n+1)2 + 2 = 2, leading to triples (3,4,5), (5,12,13), (7,24,25), etc. More generally, for every odd integer j, there exist infinitely many primitive Pythagorean triples {{in which the}} <b>hypotenuse</b> and the even leg differ by j2.|$|E
50|$|The most simple form of {{set square}} is a {{triangular}} piece of transparent plastic (or formerly of polished wood) with the centre removed. More commonly the set square bears the markings of a ruler {{and a half}} circle protractor. The outer edges are typically bevelled. These set squares come in two usual forms, both right triangles: one with 90-45-45 degree angles, the other with 30-60-90 degree angles. Combining the two forms by placing the <b>hypotenuses</b> together will also yield 15° and 75° angles. They are often purchased in packs with protractors and compasses.|$|R

In consideration of contour features in urban area, this study proposes the shortest hypotenuse-based centerline generation algorithm. It constructs right triangles with the key points of contours and connects the midpoints of <b>hypotenuses</b> to form centerlines. The algorithm is quite efficient and produces fewer redundant points. Based on the centerline generation algorithm, this study also proposes an intersection point identification algorithm via polygon construction, and it can fix the problem of inaccurate intersection point generation. Experimental result prove the efficiency and accuracy of the algorithms proposed. Key words...|$|R
40|$|The <b>hypotenuses</b> of {{all right}} triangles inscribed into a fixed conic C with fixed right-angle vertex p are {{incident}} with the Frégier point f to p and C. As p varies on the conic, {{the locus of}} the Frégier point is, in general, a conic as well. We study conics C whose Frégier locus is singular in Euclidean, elliptic and hyperbolic geometry. The richest variety of conics with this property is obtained in hyperbolic plane while in elliptic geometry only three families of conics have a singular Frégier locus.

5000|$|The {{amount of}} bending is {{approximately}} 1/28th {{of a unit}} (1.245364267°), which {{is difficult to see}} on the diagram of the puzzle, and was illustrated as a graphic. Note the grid point where the red and blue triangles in the lower image meet (5 squares to the right and two units up from the lower left corner of the combined figure), and compare it to the same point on the other figure; the edge is slightly under the mark in the upper image, but goes through it in the lower. Overlaying the <b>hypotenuses</b> from both figures results in a very thin parallelogram (represented with the four red dots) with an area of exactly one grid square, so the [...] "missing" [...] area.|$|R
5000|$|Let S be {{a sphere}} with center O, P a plane which intersects S. Draw [...] {{perpendicular}} to P and meeting P at E. Let A and B be any two {{different points in}} the intersection. Then AOE and BOE are right triangles with a common side, OE, and <b>hypotenuses</b> AO and BO equal. Therefore, the remaining sides AE and BE are equal. This proves that all points in the intersection are the same distance from the point E in the plane P, in other words all points in the intersection lie on a circle C with center E. This proves that the intersection of P and S is contained in C. Note that OE is the axis of the circle.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study an {{instance}} of the Affine Sieve, producing a level of distribution beyond that which {{can be obtained from}} cur-rent techniques, even assuming a Selberg/Ramanujan-type spectral gap. In particular, we consider the set of <b>hypotenuses</b> in a thin or-bit of Pythagorean triples. Previous work [Kon 07, Kon 09, KO 12] gave an exponent of distribution α < 1 / 12 coming from Gamburd’s [Gam 02] gap θ = 5 / 6, thereby producing R = 13 almost primes in this linear sieve problem (see § 1 for definitions). If conditioned on a best possible gap θ = 1 / 2, the known method would give an exponent α < 1 / 4, and R = 5 almost primes. The exponent 1 / 4 is the natural analogue of the “Bombieri-Vinogradov ” range of distribution for this problem, see Remark 1. 19. In this paper, we unconditionally prove the exponent α < 7 / 24 (in the “Elliott-Halberstam ” range), thereby producing R = 4 al-most primes. The main tools involve developing bilinear form...|$|R
25|$|The {{notion that}} there should be some {{standard}} correspondence between the lengths of the sides of a triangle and the angles of the triangle comes as soon as one recognizes that similar triangles maintain the same ratios between their sides. That is, for any similar triangle the ratio of the <b>hypotenuse</b> (for example) and another of the sides remains the same. If the <b>hypotenuse</b> is twice as long, so are the sides. It is these ratios that the trigonometric functions express.|$|E

40|$|In this work, we {{prove that}} any {{triangle}} whose three sidelengths are integers, cannot {{have all of}} its three medians also having integral lengths. This is done in Proposition 2. In Section 5, we give precise(i. e. necessary and sufficient) conditions for a nonisosceles, integer-sided triangle to have two integral medians. In Section 3, we offer parametric descriptions of three special families of integer-sided triangles. The first family consists of all Pythagorean triangles whose medians to their <b>hypotenuses</b> is integral. The other two medians (to the two legs) of any Pythagorean triangle are irrational, a proof of this fact {{can be found in}} reference 4 of this paper. The second family consists of all integer-sided isosceles triangles, whose only integral median is the one contained between the two sides of equal length. Finally, the third family consists of all isosceles integer-sided triangles with the two medians of equal length;having integer length.
