5|$|In mid-2012, {{legal issues}} arose when {{attempts}} were made to digitally re-release the film. G. Vijaya of Vijaya Pictures had filed a lawsuit against Gemini Colour Laboratory and Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures for attempting to re-release the film without her production company's permission. The reason for the suit was that in December 1975, Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures had transferred the entire rights of the film to Movie <b>Film</b> <b>Circuit,</b> which in turn had transferred them to Vijaya Pictures on 18 May 1976. Vijaya Pictures approached the Gemini Colour Laboratory to digitise the film for re-release, however Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures asked laboratory officials not to release the film without their prior consent. Sri Vijayalakshmi Pictures also disputed Vijaya's claim by running an advertisement in a Tamil newspaper on 18 May 2012, stating that it was the owner of the film's rights and anybody who wished to exhibit it in digital format should only do so with their permission. R. Subbiah, the judge who presided over the case, ordered the status quo to be maintained by both parties.|$|E

2500|$|After a 27-year {{absence from}} motion pictures, West {{appeared}} as Leticia Van Allen in Gore Vidal's Myra Breckinridge (1970) with Raquel Welch, Rex Reed, Farrah Fawcett, and Tom Selleck {{in a small}} part. The movie {{was intended to be}} deliberately campy sex change comedy, but had serious production problems, resulting in a botched film that was both a box-office and critical failure. Author Vidal, at great odds with inexperienced and self-styled [...] "art film" [...] director Michael Sarne, later called the film [...] "an awful joke". [...] Though Mae West was given star billing to attract ticket buyers, her scenes were truncated by the inexperienced film editor, and her songs were filmed as though they were merely side acts. Despite Myra Breckinridges mainstream failure, it continued to find an audience on the cult <b>film</b> <b>circuit</b> where West's films were regularly screened and West herself was dubbed [...] "the queen of camp". Mae West's counterculture appeal included the young and hip, and by 1971, the student body of UCLA voted Mae West [...] "Woman of the Century" [...] in honor of her relevance as a pioneering advocate of sexual frankness and courageous crusader against censorship.|$|E
