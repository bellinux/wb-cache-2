This paper attempts to explain the variation by using a new data set of waste <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> and policy determinants {{for all of the}} UK's 434 local authorities over the period 2006 Q 2 to 2008 Q 4.

40|$|Numerical models {{predict that}} the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> of {{atmospheric}} moisture decreases with time at the global scale, in response to global warming. A recent observational study (Wentz et al 2007 Science 317 233 – 5) {{did not agree with}} the results from numerical models. Here, we examine the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> by using the latest data sets for precipitation and water vapor, and suggest a consistent view of the global <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> of atmospheric moisture between numerical models and observations. Our analyses show that the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> of atmospheric moisture has also decreased over the global oceans during the past two decades. In addition, we find different temporal variations of the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> in different regions when exploring the spatial pattern of the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate.</b> In particular, the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> has increased in the high-precipitation region around the equator (i. e., the intertropical convergence zone) and decreased in the low-precipitation region located either side of the equator over the past two decades. Further exploration suggests that the temporal variation of precipitation is stronger than that of water vapor, which results in the positive trend of the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> in the high-precipitation region and the negative trend of the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> in the low-precipitation region...|$|R

40|$|Waste {{paper is}} {{suitable}} for recycling back into paper or for incineration for energy recovery. If waste paper is used for recycling, secondary pulp replaces virgin pulp. Fiber recycling is limited, however, because of physical constraints—particularly the breakage of fiber in the recycling process—and a permanent input of virgin fiber to the system is required. Therefore one can expect {{that the relationship between}} <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> and resource requirements is represented by a curved line rather than a straight one. In this article, we present a mathematical model which confirms that the relationship between <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> and primary pulp requirements can be described as nonlinear. Furthermore, we show that this nonlinear relationship leads to an optimal <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> with regard to energy consumption: 93 % for paper produced from chemical pulp, and 81 % for paper produced from mechanical pulp. Sensitivity testing additionally reveals that at low <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> increasing waste paper recycling is energy efficient, but it becomes less efficient at higher <b>recycling</b> <b>rates.</b> Close to the optimum <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> (within 10 %), increasing or decreasing the rate affects the total energy requirement less than 0. 3 %. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{degradation}} of anthraquinone dye Reactive Blue 19 (RB 19) of 600 mg/L in the synthetic wastewater was studied using a biofilm hydrolytic-aerobic recycling process (recycling process). The COD (chemical oxygen demand) and RB 19 removal efficiency could {{be up to}} 91 % and 90 % in 24 h, respectively, with the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> being 10 mL/min. When the <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> were 8 mL/min and 10 mL/min, the average COD and RB 19 removal rate reached the largest values of 109. 9 mg/L h and 23. 6 mg/L h, respectively. The results also showed that RB 19 removal rate in both the hydrolytic and aerobic reactor declined whereas COD removal rate in the aerobic reactor increased with increasing of <b>recycling</b> <b>rate.</b> With the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> of 10 mL/min, VIA (volatile fatty acid) in the wastewater was of the lowest value and pH value was apparently higher than those with other <b>recycling</b> <b>rates.</b> The ratios of VFA/alkalinity were all less than 0. 6 when the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> was more than 5 mL/min, which indicated that the activity of hydrolytic microorganisms had not been inhibited and the recycling process maintained a stable condition. Results in this work shown that hydrolytic-aerobic recycling process successfully dealt with the issues of over-acidification and inhibition in the hydrolysis process and effectively enhanced the removal efficiencies of RB 19 and COD.

A study by Golev and Corder (2016) showed that although the reported metal scrap <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> are high, i.e. {{in the range of}} 80 – 90 %, actual metal <b>recycling</b> <b>rates</b> are estimated to be below 70 % when losses and end-of-life product dissipation are taken into account.|$|R

With the arrival of the peak season of generating ELVs in China, it is urgent and important to improve the <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> of ELVs. The <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> of ELVs is influenced by multiple factors together. The existing research about the identification of influence factors of ELV <b>recycling</b> <b>rate</b> fewer considers the interaction effect among different factors. To fill the gap, firstly the influence factors are analyzed from standpoints of economy, policy, recycling network and others. Then a hybrid model based on DEMATEL (decision making trial and evaluation laboratory) and intuitionistic fuzzy sets is employed to examine the cause–effect relationships among factors. In the study, the vagueness of decision makers’ judgment and linguistic inaccuracy is dealt with effectively by intuitionistic fuzzy sets.
