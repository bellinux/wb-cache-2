40|$|Operationally, {{the water}} {{allocation}} arrangements {{found in the}} shared groundwater irrigation systems in the Bist Doab area of Punjab are identical to a "crude form " of water rights. Here, the individual farmer's access to well water is restricted in terms of number of days for which they could use the well. Also, these rights to use "water " can also be leased out. Hence, these entitlements can be treated as "tradable". Another important feature of this arrangement existing in the shareholder irrigation system is {{that the amount of}} water which the farmer can access through the well is rationed by restricted power supply. Hence, they are analogous to tradable water rights, with rationing. The potential impacts of such a rationing on efficiency of groundwater use can be examined by comparing the productivity parameters such as cropping pattern, land productivity (yield and net returns) and water productivity in crop production under shared irrigation systems with that under <b>individual</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems.</b> The learning from such a study can be used in drawing inferences on the potential outcomes of instituting water rights in groundwater. The study shows that under conditions of rationed water allocation, the farmers have high motivation to allocate more water to crops that are economically more efficient, and also use it more efficiently for the chosen crops than the farmers who have unrestricted access to groundwater by virtue of havin...|$|E
50|$|An {{economy in}} this stage has a limited {{production}} function which barely attains the minimum level of potential output. This does not entirely mean that the economy's production level is static. The output level can still be increased, as there was often a surplus of uncultivated land {{which can be used}} for increasing agricultural production. Modern science and technology has yet to be introduced. As a result, these pre-Newtonian societies, unaware of the possibilities to manipulate the external world, rely heavily on manual labor and self-sufficiency to survive.

40|$|Due to {{high demand}} for aesthetically {{pleasing}} urban landscapes from continually increasing population in Florida, new methods must be explored for outdoor water conservation. Three brands of evapotranspiration (ET) controllers were {{selected based on}} positive water savings results in arid climates. ET controllers were evaluated on irrigation application compared to a time clock schedule intended to mimic homeowner irrigation schedules. Three ET controllers were tested: Toro Intelli-sense; ETwater Smart Controller 100; Weathermatic SL 1600. Other time-based treatments were TIME, based on the historical net irrigation requirement and RTIME that was 60 % of TIME. Each treatment was replicated four times {{for a total of}} twenty St. Augustinegrass plots which were irrigated through <b>individual</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems.</b> Treatments were compared {{to each other and to}} a time-based schedule without rain sensor (TIME WORS) derived from TIME. The study period, August 2006 through November 2007, was dry compared to 30 -year historical average rainfall. The ET controllers averaged 43 % water savings compared to a time-based treatment without a rain sensor and were about twice as effective and reducing irrigation compared to a rain sensor alone. There were no differences in turfgrass quality across all treatments over the 15 -month study. The controllers adjusted their irrigation schedules to the climatic demand effectively, with maximum savings of 60 % during the winter 2006 - 2007 period and minimum savings of 9 % during spring 2007 due to persistent dry conditions. RTIME had similar savings to the ET controllers compared to TIME WORS indicating that proper adjustment of time clocks could result in substantial irrigation savings. However, the ET controllers would offer consistent savings once programmed properly. Drought Turfgrass Water conservation...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 33 - 34). Agricultural {{systems are}} vulnerable to climate variability and the resulting water supply shocks. Vulnerability assessments for agriculture have largely focused on rainfed systems or on <b>individual</b> <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> with less attention to how nested networks of irrigation systems in large river basins respond to water shortages. Irrigation releases and return flow from upstream irrigation systems become the inflow of downstream systems; if upstream systems reduce releases in years of drought, exposure to water supply shocks may increase with increasing distance downstream. This paper presents an analytical framework for assessing the vulnerability {{of a network of}} irrigation systems to water supply shocks in a large river basin, with particular attention to how the position of an irrigation system within that network structures its vulnerability. The concepts of sensitivity and exposure ??? components of vulnerability analysis ??? can be used to describe the spatial structure of the drought response of irrigated agriculture in river basins. This framework is tested in the Krishna River basin in southern India. A time-series of satellite imagery is used to map change in irrigated area between a year of normal precipitation (June 2001 - May 2002) and a drought year (June 2002 - May 2003). Precipitation in each reservoir???s watershed was quantified using satellite-based rainfall data. It is hypothesized that during drought, the change in irrigated area in reservoir command areas is spatially structured by downstream distance, percentage decrease in precipitation in a reservoir???s watershed, and the percent of the watershed that is irrigated upstream of a reservoir. Change in precipitation is a significant predictor of irrigated area change in upstream systems (p = 0. 05), while upstream irrigated area is a significant predictor of change in irrigated area basin-wide (p = 0. 07). Mid-basin systems show large decreases in irrigated area, and delta systems had unexpected low sensitivity due to the availability of groundwater. This research provides useful knowledge for water management in the Krishna River Basin and contributes an applied case study for vulnerability science...|$|E

In {{order to}} assess the {{performance}} of water management approaches and <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> used by the sugar industry in the Lowveld of Zimbabwe, a sugarcane yield and <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> simulation model was developed. The model, named ZIMsched 2. 0, was used to predict how field derived indices of <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> performance, such as the coefficient of uniformity, CV, impacted on estimated recoverable crystal, ERC, yields and the water balance. This was done {{across a range of}} soil conditions, seasonal climates, <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> types and existing and refined irrigation scheduling strategies. Results of a verification study of the model showed an index of agreement, 'd', equal to 0. 96 and a Pearson's correlation coefficient equal to 0. 94, between observed and simulated yields of ERC, relative to a reference treatment. Application of the model showed the actual and also the potential performance of the different <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> hardware. Additional applications of the tools and information which were developed {{as a result of this}} research included an integrated economic assessment of peak <b>irrigation</b> <b>system</b> design specifications and associated deficit irrigation watering strategies. In an effort to translate theoretical water savings into practical realities a range of novel water management tools was also developed. Most of the drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> in the Lowveld were performing below potential due to excessive infield variations in applied water. The performance of furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> was limited by the large variations in water applied to individual furrows, and water applications that were, on average, excessively high relative to soil water holding characteristics. Simulations showed that sub-surface drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> have a slight edge on other <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> in terms of potential efficiency. Average water savings for drip <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> ranged from approximately 2. 2 to 1. 5 Ml/ha relative to floppy <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> and 3. 5 to 2. 3 Ml/ha relative to typical furrow <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> depending on how water applications were scheduled. A major finding was that there was potential for the Lowveld sugar industry to use up to 30 % less water per hectare on an annual basis if ZIMsched, a specialist spreadsheet-based irrigation scheduling tool developed during the course of the project, was used to derive more appropriate and system specific water management guidelines. However, simulations showed that with the more precise irrigation scheduling there could be a slight crop yield penalty when the distribution uniformity of applied water was poor...|$|R

Performance evaluation methodologies presented so far are either qualitative such as DA (Diagnostic Analysis), RA (Rapid Appraisal) and FA (Framework Appraisal), or they are similar to classical methods even if they produce quantitative indicators. They fail to introduce performance standards. In this study, using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), which is a quantitative method and produces realistic standards, 8 <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> were evaluated and their performances were determined. With respect {{to the number of}} decision-making units, inputs, outputs, and corresponding returns to scale for <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> a suitable DEA model was selected. Capabilities of DEA allow for separate treatment of performance evaluation of overall irrigation network and its operating company. This feature is implemented using different technical and operational indicators. The results indicated that Zayandeh Rood <b>irrigation</b> <b>system,</b> among the 8 <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems,</b> has the highest technical efficiency. Minab and Varamin systems have the lowest technical efficiencies. Golestan and Behbahan Networks perform well, although their operating companies are inefficient. Garmsar, Ghazvin, and Moghan systems, although not inefficient, have some improvement potentials. In general, with respect to the capabilities of DEA in performance evaluation of <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems</b> and indicating appropriate standard, it can be concluded that this technique is quite efficient and successful for performance evaluation and improvement of <b>irrigation</b> <b>systems...</b>|$|R
