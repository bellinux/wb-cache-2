500|$|IGN {{reviewer}} Matt Fowler {{gave the}} episode an [...] "Incredible" [...] rating of 9.6/10, saying that: [...] "I'm sure we all loved Dexter's final moments with Arthur, {{down in the}} toy train bomb shelter, but now {{looking back at the}} scene, knowing the final moments of the episode, it's filled with so many more eerie easter eggs. Something was definitely up when Arthur said, [...] "It's already over." [...] We all thought so because we've heard him say those words before. We also saw Dexter take a beat after the line, confused about its meaning. We could have chalked it {{up to the fact that}} Arthur was accepting his own death, but Dexter's furrowed brow let us know that something more sinister was in play here. Of course, the real bitch here is that Dexter, having dispatched of Trinity officially, now can't go back and do it with the spirit of vengeance. The scene stands quite beautifully on its own, but Dexter would certainly have not given Arthur an empathetic send off if he knew what that monster had done. We can all point fingers at certain missteps that Dexter took throughout the entire season - mistakes that led to Rita's demise - but when you take it in as a whole it's a rather satisfying and cleverly constructed story that actually made us all buy and believe, by the end, that Dexter truly wanted to be rid of his murderous spirit. His stubborn need to kill Trinity himself wound up circumventing the entire justice system, which would have wound up catching Arthur based solely on Deb's tenacity and expert detective work." [...] Also, IGN listed Arthur Mitchell as 2nd on a list of Dexter's Top 10 Kills saying that [...] "This was the murder that America was clamoring for. And it was effin' great."

That year’s farm bill was not completed until April, 1996. (Subsequently, it has come to be known as the 1996 [...] not the 1995 [...] farm bill). Current legislation does not expire until December, 2002. Thus, it would be quite a change from the recent pattern to have a new farm bill approved a full year ahead of time. Why is that even a possibility? Two responses seem appropriate. First, agricultural leaders in Congress concede that the current legislation is not working particularly well. This year will be the fourth straight year for late-season “emergency” payments to farmers.

I am not so gung ho. On a bad day I might even be clinically depressed. Much work has been done and much data have been collected, but in my view we are not much further on than we {{were in the middle of}} the last century before cognitive psychology was even thought of. Rather than a happy marriage, what I see is a sham of a relationship marked by a crushing coldness on the part of the once blushing bride (who by contrast flirts outrageously with just about every other intellectual tradition that shows an interest) and a barely restrained anger on the part of a frustrated groom. Before long I think the latter will run off with a new partner (the rather voluptuous and, for some at least, alluring neuroscience). But I see no more hope for the old fellow here.

40|$|The low exit {{costs that}} {{characterize}} financial markets are significantly {{responsible for the}} strange version of administrative law that applies to financial regulation. I {{do not intend to}} assert any deterministic thesis. History and path dependency clearly matter. It is unquestionably true, for example, that historical decisions such as that to include regional presidents of the Fed banks on the FOMC have had a lasting effect on the emergence of {{what appears to be a}} bizarre regulatory body. Nevertheless, the distinction between industries characterized by high versus low exit costs has considerable explanatory power, and can help explain not only why financial regulation includes so many exceptions to ordinary precepts of administrative law, but also why financial regulation suffers from a general deficit of accountability and transparency. The concept of exit costs may have broader explanatory implications as well. It can help explain the demise of railroad-rate regulation and the significant deregulation in other transportation industries, because the development of competitive alternatives dramatically lowered the exit costs to consumers in these industries. It can also help explain the demise of labor unions in manufacturing, given the reduced costs of exit from domestic manufacturing production associated with globalized trade. Attention to exit costs also reveals that process-intensive administrative law may be possible, even in industries whose technologies otherwise are characterized by low exit costs, provided that the government has other ways to control entrance in and exit from a market. In the end, however, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not <b>bet</b> against the ingenuity of the finance industry in figuring out how to work around these kinds of efforts to corral financial assets...|$|R

60|$|The {{principal}} {{thing that}} they have to show you, at Greenwich Hospital, is the Painted Hall. It is a splendid and spacious room, at least a hundred feet long and half as high, with a ceiling painted in fresco by Sir James Thornhill. As a work of art, I presume, this frescoed canopy has little merit, though it produces an exceedingly rich effect by its brilliant coloring and as a specimen of magnificent upholstery. The walls of the grand apartment are entirely covered with pictures, many of them representing battles and other naval incidents that were once fresher in the world's memory than now, but chiefly portraits of old admirals, comprising the whole line of heroes who have trod the quarter-decks of British ships for more than two hundred years back. Next to a tomb in Westminster Abbey, which was Nelson's most elevated object of ambition, it would seem to be the highest need of a naval warrior to have his portrait hung up in the Painted Hall; but, by dint of victory upon victory, these illustrious personages have grown to be a mob, and by no means a very interesting one, so far as regards the character of the faces here depicted. They are generally commonplace, and often singularly stolid; and I have observed (both in the Painted Hall and elsewhere, and not only in portraits, but in the actual presence of such renowned people as I have caught glimpses of) that the countenances of heroes are not nearly so impressive as those of statesmen,--except, of course, in the rare instances where warlike ability has been but the one-sided manifestation of a profound genius for managing the world's affairs. Nine tenths of these distinguished admirals, for instance, if their faces tell truth, must needs have been blockheads, and might have served better, one would imagine, as wooden figure-heads for their own ships than to direct any difficult and intricate scheme of action from the quarter-deck. It is doubtful whether the same kind of men will hereafter meet with a similar degree of success; for they were victorious chiefly through the old English hardihood, exercised in a field of which modern science had not yet got possession. Rough valor has lost something of its value, since their days, and must continue to sink lower and lower in the comparative estimate of warlike qualities. In the next naval war, as between England and France, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>bet,</b> methinks, upon the Frenchman's head.|$|E

It is that girl Covington's doing, I have no doubt, {{though it was not}} the minx herself, for the description does not tally at all. She has light brown hair and grayish sort of eyes. There is one comfort, she would learn nothing to my disadvantage from the old woman, nor, I believe, from anyone at Stowmarket. In fact, she would only get more and more confirmation of my story. I have no fear upon that score, but the thing shows how that girl is working on my track. As for the lawyer, he is an old fool; and if it hadn't been for her <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>bet</b> a hundred to one that he would never have entertained any suspicion that all was not right. It is her doing all through, and this is a piece of it. Of course she could have no suspicion that I was not John Simcoe, but I suppose she wanted to learn if there was any dark spot in my history--whether I had ever been suspected of robbing a bank, or had been expelled from school for thieving, or something of that sort. I begin to be downright afraid of her. She had a way of looking through me, when I was telling my best stories to the General, that always put me out. She disliked me from the first, though I am sure I tried in every way to be pleasant to her. I felt from the day I first saw her that she was an enemy, and that if any trouble ever did come it would be through her. I have no doubt she is moving heaven and earth to find Walter; but that she will never do, for Harrison is as true as steel, and he is the only man who could put them on the right track. Moreover, I have as much pull over him as he has over me. He has never had a doubt about my being John Simcoe; he doesn't know about the other affair, but only that Walter stood between me and the estate, and he was quite ready to lend me a hand to manage {{to get him out of}} the way. So in that business he is in it as deep as I am, while I know of a score of schemes he has been engaged in, any one of which would send him abroad for life. I expect those inquiries were made at Stowmarket to endeavor to find out whether any child had been sent down there. If so, Miss Covington is not so sharp as I took her to be. Stowmarket would be the very last place where a man, having relations and friends there, would send a child whom he wished to keep concealed. Still it is annoying, confoundedly annoying; and it shows that these people, that is to say Hilda Covington, are pushing their inquiries in every direction, likely or unlikely.|$|E
