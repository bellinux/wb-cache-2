However, leisure traffic took over, and the canal is now {{as busy as}} <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was,</b> with leisure boating complemented by fishing, towpath walking and gongoozling.

25|$|In Spanish art, a bodegón is a still-life {{painting}} depicting pantry items, such as victuals, game, and drink, often {{arranged on}} a simple stone slab, and also a painting {{with one or more}} figures, but significant still-life elements, typically set in a kitchen or tavern. Starting in the Baroque period, such paintings became popular in Spain {{in the second quarter of}} the 17th century. The tradition of still-life painting appears to have started and was far more popular in the contemporary Low Countries, today Belgium and Netherlands (then Flemish and Dutch artists), than <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> in southern Europe. Northern still lifes had many subgenres; the breakfast piece was augmented by the trompe-l'œil, the flower bouquet, and the vanitas. In Spain there were much fewer patrons for this sort of thing, but a type of breakfast piece did become popular, featuring a few objects of food and tableware laid on a table. Still-life painting in Spain, also called bodegones, was austere. It differed from Dutch still life, which often contained rich banquets surrounded by ornate and luxurious items of fabric or glass. The game in Spanish paintings is often plain dead animals still waiting to be skinned. The fruits and vegetables are uncooked. The backgrounds are bleak or plain wood geometric blocks, often creating a surrealist air. Even while both Dutch and Spanish still life often had an embedded moral purpose, the austerity, which some find akin to the bleakness of some of the Spanish plateaus, appears to reject the sensual pleasures, plenitude, and luxury of Dutch still-life paintings.|$|E
25|$|Science is a {{magnificent}} force, {{but it is}} not a teacher of morals. It can perfect machinery, but it adds no moral restraints to protect society from the misuse of the machine. It can also build gigantic intellectual ships, but it constructs no moral rudders for the control of storm-tossed human vessel. It not only fails to supply the spiritual element needed but some of its unproven hypotheses rob the ship of its compass and thus endanger its cargo. In war, science has proven itself an evil genius; it has made war more terrible than <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> before. Man used to be content to slaughter his fellowmen on a single plane, the earth's surface. Science has taught him to go down into the water and shoot up from below and to go up into the clouds and shoot down from above, thus making the battlefield three times as bloody as it was before; but science does not teach brotherly love. Science has made war so hellish that civilization was about to commit suicide; and now we are told that newly discovered instruments of destruction will make the cruelties of the late war seem trivial in comparison with the cruelties of wars that may come in the future. If civilization is to be saved from the wreckage threatened by intelligence not consecrated by love, it must be saved by the moral code of the meek and lowly Nazarene. His teachings, and His teachings alone, can solve the problems that vex the heart and perplex the world.|$|E

His vision of a village-dominated economy was shunted aside during his lifetime as rural romanticism, and his call for a national ethos of personal austerity and nonviolence has proved antithetical to the goals of an aspiring economic and military power."

Jim Rossignol from Eurogamer initially rated the game as equally memorable to Oblivion but later saying that it is [...] "the same game as <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was,</b> only this time with a slightly weirder backdrop, and less interesting questing".

500|$|In 1931 Beach Thomas {{lamented the}} {{inability}} of the National Farmers Union of England and Wales to arrest what he saw as the decline of the farming industry. In A Countryman's Creed (1946) he harked back to a lost world, perhaps even a world that was more of his imagination than <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> fact. As F. R. Leavis had done before him, Beach Thomas sought a rural revival to curtail what he perceived to be the rapid changes to traditional modes of living that had been evident in particular {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War and which were now ideologically challenged following the substantial victory of the socialist Labour Party in the 1945 general election. The new government was a threat to Beach Thomas's view of the world because, in the words of literary critic Robert Hemmings, it saw the countryside [...] "as merely a giant dairy and granary for the city." ...|$|E
500|$|Dream {{magazine}} columnist Kevin Moist {{stated that}} the album [...] "further jazzified his mixture of street poetry, soulful spirit, political commitment, and Black cultural expression."

But Scott-Heron was never a one-dimensional ranter, and his pen is as double-edged here as <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was,</b> slicing into the growing self-destructiveness and sell-out/buy-in tendencies that were fragmenting the Black community, as incisively as it stabs at the jowls of evil in the White House. As badass as it is understated, and really hasn’t dated just a little bit." [...] The Observer called the album a [...] "jazz fusion pillar stone, with a social conscience to boot". Music writer Karl Keely praised Scott-Heron's vocal maturity from his previous work, and noted Jackson's influence for improving and expanding the music's melodic content. Keely commented that it demonstrates [...] "the evolution of Scott-Heron from politicised poet to soulful singer".|$|E

500|$|In a {{negative}} review in The Sunday Telegraph, historian Noel Malcolm suggested that Dalrymple [...] "is spreading his net too widely, so that 'sentimentality' comes {{to stand for}} any moralising view that does not satisfy his own scrutiny; it's not that these things should not be criticised, merely that sentimentalism {{may not be the}} key to what is wrong with them". Malcolm also questioned Dalrymple's views on modern educational theory, writing [...] "these ideas have long and complex histories, in which sentimentalism {{is only part of the}} story. The 'progressive' attack on discipline, and on traditional institutions such as the family, was concerned as much with power-structures and class as <b>it</b> <b>ever</b> <b>was</b> with sentiment or human goodness", and took issue with Dalrymple's assessment of Rousseau. [...] In a short negative review of the book in The Independent on Sunday, which appeared after the book's 2011 paperback release, Brandon Robshaw wrote, [...] "There is some good sense here, but it's vitiated by the pompous, peevish tone, the futile nostalgia for an airbrushed past, unnecessary sideswipes (at John Rawls, for example, or climate science) and by the poor editing". In an ambivalent review on the website MercatorNet, Francis Phillips wrote [...] "The book leaves one with the impression that it is a somewhat hotchpotch compendium of views and articles already well rehearsed by the author—though nonetheless true for all that. What is disheartening is his bleak attitude towards human nature; having diagnosed the disease he is at a loss to suggest a remedy".|$|E
