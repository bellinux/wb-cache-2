5|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} are largely determined by {{activity in the}} area postrema in the medulla of the brainstem, in a region known as the chemoreceptor trigger zone. This area contains a large population of type D2 dopamine receptors. Consequently, drugs that activate D2 receptors have a <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> to cause nausea. This group includes some medications that are administered for Parkinson's disease, {{as well as other}} dopamine agonists such as apomorphine. In some cases, D2-receptor antagonists such as metoclopramide are useful as anti-nausea drugs.|$|E
5|$|The high {{temperatures}} and dew points created moderate instability across the outbreak area. CAPE values, a {{measurement of the}} level of tropospheric instability, were over 1000J/kg, and helicity levels, a measurement of the potential for rotating winds, reached over 200m²/s². The upper level jet stream also contributed a large amount of wind shear. These factors were all indicative of a <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> for severe weather.|$|E

Due {{to the presence}} of Emily, a state of emergency was declared for all of Puerto Rico. Officials ordered the preparation of over 400 storm shelters and ensured adequate water supply. The morning before the storm, government workers were dismissed, and national courtrooms remained closed. The United States Coast Guard issued a statement urging residents of Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands to avoid recreational boating and swimming until Emily had passed. JetBlue Airways waived fees for flights into the Dominican Republic because of the inclement weather conditions. Four cruise ships, Oasis of the Seas, Freedom of the Seas, Carnival Dream and Carnival Liberty altered their courses through the Caribbean to avoid the storm.|$|E

In 2008, recognizing the need to diversify its sources of energy and reduce emissions, Mexico passed a law to push developing biofuels that don't threaten food security and the agriculture ministry has since identified some 2.6 million hectares (6.4 million acres) of land with a <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> to produce jatropha. The Yucatán Peninsula, for instance, {{in addition to being}} a corn producing region, also contains abandoned sisal plantations, where the growing of Jatropha for biodiesel production would not displace food.|$|E
5|$|A {{strengthening}} {{ridge to}} the south turned the storm {{to the south}}west, bringing Gillian back over water; however, the circulation became poorly-defined and the convection decreased due to land interaction. Early on 11March the JTWC discontinued advisories. When Gillian was downgraded to a tropical low, the proximity to land and continued wind shear prevented initial redevelopment. The system tracked westward through the Gulf of Carpentaria due to the ridge to the south, passing just north of Mornington Island on 12March. The next day, the convection reorganised as the circulation became better defined. On14 March, the JTWC again assessed a <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> for Gillian redeveloping into a tropical cyclone, noting {{the appearance of a}} central dense overcast. At 06:00UTC on the same day, the BoM again upgraded Gillian to tropical cyclone status in the central Gulf of Carpentaria. Due to a weak trough in the region, the storm turned to the northeast. Increasing wind shear again caused the storm to lose organisation early on 15 March, prompting the BoM to downgrade Gillian to a tropical low.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – This {{empirical}} study {{attempts to}} make a contribution to career theory in general, and to the literature on high-potential careers in particular, by examining the careers of real <b>high</b> <b>potentials,</b> taking place in the 21 st century world of work, from the perspectives of the <b>high</b> <b>potentials</b> themselves {{as well as those of}} their organizations. Design/methodology/approach – A total of 34 interviews were conducted within 3 study samples: <b>high</b> <b>potentials</b> (N = 14), organisational representatives employed by the same organisations that provided the high-potential participants (N = 8), and organisational representatives employed by organisations that did not allow for interviewing of their <b>high</b> <b>potentials</b> (N = 12). Findings – The current study suggests that <b>high</b> <b>potentials</b> still have organisational-traditional careers. High upward mobility, low inter-organisational mobility and career self-management emerged as key features of real high-potential careers. Practical implications – Implications are spelled out with respect to the “streaming” of different types of employees in the workforce and the importance of expectations management. Originality/value of paper – Not only are the viewpoints of individuals largely absent in the literature on high-potential careers, the majority of publications on the subject matter are also non-empirical and take a rather normative stance. The interview study presented in this paper looks into the assumptions of real high-potential careers from the erspectives of the <b>high</b> <b>potentials</b> themselves as well as those of their organizations, providing empirical data which is interpretive and descriptive rather than normative. status: publishe...|$|R
5|$|The {{origins of}} Gillian {{were from a}} weak {{tropical}} low that persisted in the eastern Arafura Sea on 6March. The next day, the system moved into the Gulf of Carpentaria, where it developed convection, or thunderstorms, which organised into curved rainbands. The thunderstorms were located west of a circulation, was exposed due to moderate wind shear. At 06:00UTC on 8March, the Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) office in Darwin began issuing warnings on the developing tropical low. Around that time, the United States Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC), indicated the <b>high</b> <b>potential</b> for tropical cyclogenesis due to the increasingly organised circulation and convection. At 09:00UTC on 8March, the BoM upgraded the low to Tropical Cyclone Gillian, and six hours later, the JTWC initiated advisories on the storm as Tropical Cyclone 17P. After its formation, Gillian moved slowly southward toward Queensland within an area of weak steering currents. Despite ongoing wind shear, forecasters anticipated strengthening due to warm water temperatures and favourable outflow. The storm turned more toward the southeast due {{to the influence of}} a ridge to the northeast. Early on 10March, Gillian made landfall along the western Cape York Peninsula of Queensland, after weakening below tropical cyclone status.|$|E
