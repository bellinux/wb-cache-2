50|$|To set up {{payments}} by Direct Debit, the payer must {{complete a}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> <b>Instruction</b> to the merchant. This instruction contains bank-approved wording {{that makes it}} clear the payer is setting up an ongoing authority for the merchant to debit their account. The interface for completing the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> <b>Instruction</b> {{is controlled by the}} merchant, who then sends the data from the form to the customer's bank, via Bacs.|$|E

50|$|A <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>instruction</b> {{differs from}} a direct deposit and {{standing}} order instruction, which are {{initiated by the}} payer. A standing order involves fixed payment amounts paid periodically, while a direct debit can be of any amount and can be casual or periodic. They also {{should not be confused}} with a Continuous Payment Authority, where the payee collects money whenever it feels it is owed.|$|E

Direct credit instructions {{are used for}} payrolls and other large scale regular payments. <b>Direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>instructions</b> are used by insurance companies, utilities and other large organisations which receive regular payments. Although governed by APCA rules, the actual exchanges of instructions occur through bilateral exchanges.

5000|$|The service allowed UK retail {{banks to}} {{electronically}} request {{the transfer of}} <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> and standing order payments arrangements, on behalf of new customers, wishing to transfer payment arrangements from a previous bank accounts. The scheme was {{also known as the}} Inter Bank Transfer of <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> <b>Instructions</b> [...] service and is governed by BACS (also known as Voca), the UK's automated payments clearing scheme.|$|R
5000|$|Any <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>instruction</b> {{that has}} not been used to collect funds for over 13 months is {{automatically}} cancelled by the customer's bank [...] (this is known as a [...] "dormancy period"). This can cause problems when the mandate is used infrequently, for instance, taking a payment to settle the bill for a seldom-used credit card. If the credit card company has not collected a payment using the Direct Debit mandate for over 13 months the direct debit mandate may have been cancelled as dormant without the customer's knowledge, and the direct debit claim will fail.|$|E

50|$|This was {{followed}} in 2008 by the mandatory requirement for all new service users to use AUDDIS - {{a more efficient}} system for organisations to send new <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> <b>instructions</b> to their customers’ bank, or building society, electronically instead of in paper format. In the same year, annual <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> volumes surpassed the three billion mark and, by 2013, this figure reached 3.5 billion with 100 billion payments processed since 1968.|$|R

50|$|To prevent abuse, account holders must {{watch their}} bank {{statements}} and ask their bank to return unauthorised (or wrong) debit notes. As fraudulent <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> <b>instructions</b> are easily traced, abuse is rare. However, {{there can be}} issues when the amount billed and collected is incorrect or unexpectedly large. There have also been cases of fraudulent <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> where the defrauders tried to collect very small individual sums from large numbers of accounts, {{in the hope that}} most account holders would be slow to raise an issue about such small sums, giving the defrauders enough time to withdraw the collected money and disappear.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> is an <b>instruction</b> from a {{customer}} to their bank or building society authorising an organisation to collect varying amounts from their account, normally for regular payments {{for everything from}} household bills to charitable donations. Over 4 billion <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> were processed {{for the first time}} in 2016, and <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> payments are protected by the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> Guarantee, a money back consumer safeguard.|$|R
50|$|In Sweden, {{the problem}} of <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> fraud is much smaller than in the UK, since there are more strict {{requirements}} on which companies that can use <b>direct</b> <b>debit.</b> Still there are claims that well-known companies have taken too much money through <b>direct</b> <b>debit.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> is {{a payment}} method for {{recurring}} payments in the UK. It {{is the third}} most popular payment method in the UK, after cash and debit card, according to Payments UK. Bacs Payment Schemes Limited is the organisation with responsibility for the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> and Bacs <b>Direct</b> Credit schemes. <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> was invented by Alastair Hanton while he was working at Unilever {{as a way of}} collecting payments more efficiently. <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> accounts for the payment of 73% of household bills and almost nine out of 10 British adults have at least one <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> commitment. In fact, in 2015 nearly 3.9 billion <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> were processed, representing a year-on-year increase of 239 million which surpasses the previous record for annual growth of 161 million, set in 2004. 4.07 billion <b>Direct</b> <b>Debits</b> were processed in 2016, an increase of 4.9% from 2015. Payments UK predicts the figure is expected to rise to 4.4 billion by 2026.|$|R
50|$|In Malaysia, the <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> {{system is}} {{available}} via the product known as FPX - Financial Process Exchange.

50|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>debits</b> are {{available}} {{in a number of}} countries, including the United Kingdom, Brazil, Germany, Sweden, Spain, South Africa, Switzerland, and the Netherlands. <b>Direct</b> <b>debits</b> are made under each country's rules, and are usually restricted to domestic transactions in those countries. An exception in this respect is the Single Euro Payments Area which allows for Euro-denominated cross-border (and domestic) <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> since November 2010. In the United States, <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> are processed through the Automated Clearing House network.|$|R

50|$|SEPA <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> {{currently}} works alongside national <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> schemes. As such, it {{is possible}} to collect payment through both SDD and/or a national <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> scheme. However, from 1 August 2014, it will no longer be possible to collect Euro-denominated payments through national <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> schemes in Euro-zone SEPA countries. In October 2016 SDD and IBAN become the mandatory methods for transfers in Euro in all of the EU and EEA, but not mandatory for transfers in other currencies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{problem of}} <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> fraud is {{extensive}} {{according to research}} by Liverpool Victoria Insurance [...] which reveals that over 97,000 Britons have fallen victim to criminals setting up fraudulent <b>direct</b> <b>debits</b> from their accounts. An average of £540 goes missing before the customer notices. <b>Direct</b> <b>debit</b> payment fraud in 2010 accounted for around 10.6% of all identity fraud cases. The extent of <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> scamming is set to grow to 41,000 cases a year by 2013, equating to a 57% rise.|$|R

50|$|In Australia, <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> is {{performed}} through the direct entry system {{also known as}} BECS (Bulk Electronic Clearing System) or CS2, managed by the Australian Payments Clearing Association. An account holder can authorise a company to collect <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> payments, without notifying the bank, but <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> is not available on all financial accounts.|$|R
50|$|Before {{a company}} or {{organisation}} can collect payment by <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> {{they need to}} be approved by a bank, or use a commercial bureau to collect <b>direct</b> <b>debit</b> payments on their behalf.

40|$|The {{letter of}} credit {{contract}} and the collection contract The diploma thesis deals with {{the topic of the}} <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> Contract and the Letter of Credit. A Letter of Credit is a special payment instrument issued as a rule by a bank that the principal has undertaken to pay to the person in whose interest the Letter of Credit is open and designated as the authorized amount up to the amount agreed. The <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> is the commitment of the collector of receivables to obtain from the third party a receipt of a sum of money or other <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit.</b> Current legislation, contained in the Civil Code, took over the legal regulation of the Letter of Credit and the <b>Direct</b> <b>Debit</b> from the Commercial Code without any major changes.
