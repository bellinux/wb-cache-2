60|$|The {{wages of}} superintendance are {{distinguished}} from ordinary wages by another peculiarity, {{that they are}} not <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> out of capital, like the wages of all other labourers, but merge in the profit, and are not realized until the production is completed. This takes them entirely out of the ordinary law of wages. The wages of labourers who are <b>paid</b> <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> are regulated by the number of competitors compared with the amount of capital; the labourers can consume no more than what has been previously accumulated. But there is no such limit to the remuneration of a kind of labour which is not paid for out of wealth previously accumulated, but out of that produce which it is itself employed in calling into existence.|$|R
