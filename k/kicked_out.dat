40|$|How {{to improve}} the {{transfer}} capability of the weighted networks {{is one of the}} most important problems in complex networks. In this paper, a novel and effective routing strategy is proposed by deleting edges in proper order according to their different definitions of edge weight. <b>Kicking</b> <b>out</b> few specified edges can enhance the transfer capability of weighted networks greatly. Simulations on both compute generated and real world networks show that the routing strategy <b>kicking</b> <b>out</b> edges according to the product of the strengths of two nodes of the edge is more effective. Moreover, we analyse the curve of critical packet generation rate of <b>kicking</b> <b>out</b> all deletable edges and find that there is a sharp transition after <b>kicking</b> <b>out</b> some edges. Due to the strongly improved network capacity, easy realization on networks, and low cost, the strategy may be useful for real communication networks...|$|R
