If there is no <b>human</b> <b>dimension,</b> if Africans do not help, the problem cannot be overcome by the distribution of prophylactics: on the contrary, they increase it. The solution must have two elements: firstly, bringing out the <b>human</b> <b>dimension</b> of sexuality, {{that is to say}} a spiritual and human renewal that would bring with it a new way of behaving towards others, and secondly, true friendship offered above all to those who are suffering, a willingness to make sacrifices and to practise self-denial, to be alongside the suffering.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of theoretical agronomy, research in agronomy, more {{than in any other}} field, is strongly related to local areas. It can be considered a science of ecoregions, because it is closely linked to soil properties and climate, which are never exactly the same from one place to another.

Elsewhere however it is suggested that such views are partly based on a misreading of the films, especially his earlier ones, which has impeded an appreciation of the humour and irony which pervade his work; and other viewers have been able to make the connection between the film's form and its <b>human</b> <b>dimension.</b>|$|E

40|$|Increasingly, natural {{resource}} managers see the marine protected areas {{that they are}} responsible for as linked social-ecological systems. This requires an equal focus on managing for both natural and <b>human</b> <b>dimensions</b> of the protected estate. Consequently, identification of indicators that represent the <b>human</b> <b>dimensions</b> of Large Scale Marine Protected Areas (LSMPAs) such as the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) is critical if these values are to be properly considered as part of standard management practice. Assessment and monitoring of the <b>human</b> <b>dimensions</b> of LSMPAs requires a replicable, collaborative process, rolled out at local scales but comparable across vast, socially and geographically diverse areas. This paper explores the application of a process for the development, assessment, and monitoring of the GBR's <b>human</b> <b>dimensions.</b> The process includes (a) development of a conceptual framework that links indicator sets to the desired state of the GBR's human dimensions; and (b) a collaborative approach including ten practical steps to implement assessment, monitoring, and benchmarking of the <b>human</b> <b>dimensions</b> of an LSMPA. We conclude with examination of challenges and opportunities for implementing this process in the GBR context, specifically with respect to the targets and objectives of the Reef 2050 Long-Term Sustainability Plan...|$|R

500|$|Zimmer {{wanted to}} avoid writing music {{that had been done}} in earlier Batman films, so the score became an {{amalgamation}} of orchestra and electronic music. The film's ninety-piece orchestra was developed from members of various London orchestras, and Zimmer chose to use more than the normal number of cellos. Zimmer enlisted a boy soprano to help reflect the music in some of the film's scenes where tragic memories of Bruce Wayne's parents are involved. [...] "He's singing a fairly pretty tune and then he gets stuck, it's like froze, arrested development," [...] said Zimmer. He also attempted to add a <b>human</b> <b>dimension</b> to Batman, whose behavior would typically be seen as [...] "psychotic", through the music. Both composers collaborated to create 2 hours and 20 minutes worth of music for the film, with Zimmer composing the action sequences and Howard focusing on the dramatic scenes.|$|E
500|$|Cut {{into the}} western wall of the debating chamber are {{laminated}} glass panels, of different shapes, intended to give a <b>human</b> <b>dimension</b> to the chamber. At night, light is shone through the glass panels and is projected onto the MSPs' desks to create {{the impression that the}} chamber is never unoccupied.

Glimpses out of the chamber are given to the landscape and city beyond, intentionally, to visually connect the MSPs to Scotland. The necessities of a modern parliament, banks of light, cameras, electronic voting and the MSPs' console have all been transformed into works of craft and art, displaying the sweeping curves and leaf motifs that inform the rest of the building.

To date, <b>human</b> <b>dimensions</b> research in arctic regions has concentrated primarily on local events and contexts. As such, it complements analysis elsewhere of adaptation and sustainable development within broad institutional, social, and environmental contexts. This paper reviews five projects from the <b>Human</b> <b>Dimensions</b> of the Arctic System (HARC) initiative, established by the US National Science Foundation in 1997. Common themes and findings are highlighted: climatic variations or change affect societies through interactions with human activities; population dynamics provide key quantitative indicators of social impacts and well being; and specific impacts and responses {{are the result of}} complex, context-sensitive interactions. Congruent approaches to the challenges of interdisciplinary research are also identified: multivariate time plots aid the integration of data, retrospective and prospective studies are part of a continuum and reinforce one another, comparative studies are essential for understanding general principles of <b>human</b> <b>dimensions,</b> and arctic residents can {{play a vital role in}} research and action...|$|R
