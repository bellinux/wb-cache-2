40|$|Construction {{projects}} are generally {{designed as a}} general contract or a complete contract. In a general contract the commercial contract {{that is being used}} is AB 04 and related advice and instructions, AMA AF 07. In AB 04 there is an insurance requirement that stipulates that the contractor shall take all risks and liability insurance for the contract where the client must be co-insured. Construction law is almost exclusively regulated by the various standard contracts, one of those is AB 04. The Construction Contracts Committe is an organization that has published the standard contracts in this area of law and also the advice and instructions to help the parties to understand the agreements. The insurance requirement occurs in an area of law that is complex and the meaning of the concept is not entirely clear, nor which of the parties’ interests and responsibilities that are covered by the types of insurances that are provided by the insurance requirement. This can create problems for the contractor and his client because the possibility exists that neither party knows what protection, or the extent of that protection, that the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> provides for the contract. The essay investigates the meaning and consequence of the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> by discussing how the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> is portrayed by the literature that is published in this field of law. To investigate the meaning of the <b>insurance</b> <b>obligation</b> it is in my opinion important to also describe the meaning of the insured interest, some of the different types of liability that the parties may have and also the meaning of minimum coverage that are possible to have with the two types of insurance.

Many are of the opinion, however, that the electrically assisted bicycle is more like a bicycle than a light moped.

40|$|Return {{guarantee}} {{constitutes a}} key ingredient of classical life insurance premium calculation. In the current low interest rate environment insurers face increasingly strong {{financial incentives to}} reduce guaranteed returns embedded in life insurance contracts. However, return guarantee lowering efforts are restrained by associated demand effects, since a higher guaranteed return makes the net price of the insurance cover lower. This tradeoff between possibly higher future <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> {{and the possibility of}} a larger demand for life insurance products can theoretically also be considered when determining optimal guaranteed returns. In this paper, optimality of return guarantee levels is analyzed from a solvency point of view. Availability and some other properties of optimal solutions for guaranteed returns are explored and compared in a simple model for two measures of solvency risk (company-level and contract-level VaR). The paper concludes that a solvency risk minimizing optimal guaranteed return may theoretically exist, although its practical availability can be impeded by economic and regulatory constraints...|$|R
40|$|In the United States {{the risk}} that a {{financial}} breakdown {{could lead to a}} taxpayer bailout of the deposit insurance fund has been cited to justify current regulatory controls on what activities may be affiliated with banks. Despite some regulatory changes in the 1990 s to protect taxpayers from future debacles, however, widespread failures could still expose taxpayers to losses.; This article proposes a new way to monitor the deposit insurance fund by having the FDIC issue capital notes. Because the interest paid on the notes would be suspended if the fund required a loan from the Treasury or eliminated if taxpayer funds were contributed to offset deposit insurance losses, noteholders would have more incentive to clearly signal the condition of the insurance fund. This signal would help regulators, taxpayers, and their congressional representatives monitor the health of the fund and would change the incentive structure facing FDIC directors.

At the same time, the other component of the ratio, <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations,</b> grew rapidly.

The risk that the longevity experience is higher than the one forecasted, i. e. longevity risk, is explicitly consideredin Solvency II standard formula as a sub-module of the life underwriting risk module. The life underwriting risk module includes all the life <b>insurance</b> and reinsurance <b>obligations,</b> except the SLT health <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> (EIOPA 2012), where the longevity risk is one of the seven sub-modules. According to Solvency II, solvency capital requirements (from herein SCRs) can be computed by a standard formula or an internal model. Nevertheless, the scenario in which the insurance companies operate is often more complex than that one assumed by the standard formula. According to the standard formula the SCR is represented as the change in net asset value due to longevity shock which is a permanent 20 % reduction of mortality rates for all ages. A constant shock is not reasonable for all ages and maturities. The scenario related to the standard formula may lead to a biased allocation of capital, because of the volatility of longevity phenomenon in respect of different ages. In this paper we examine the adequacy of SCRs {{on the basis of the}} standard formula. To correctly calculate the solvency capital requirement we follow a multi-period approach in the sense that we evaluate at the beginning of each year the amount of capital that the insurer need to meet its future obligations year by year till the contract will be in force. We examine the adequacy of the shocks structure suggested by the standard formula studying its impact on the SCR for longevity risk (SCRLong) and liabilities at different ages...|$|R

There is a special class of construction work {{that has the potential}} for a different set of safety issues &ndash; work that could damage hazardous infrastructure with possibly catastrophic effects for workers and the public alike. The natural gas pipeline failure as a result of car park construction in a light industrial area at Ghislenghien, Belgium in 2004, which resulted in 24 deaths, is one such example. The primary focus of this research is a case study regarding project-related construction activity around high pressure natural gas pipelines in Australia. Drawing on data gathered from in-depth interviews, alternate definitions and meanings of risk are explored amongst stakeholders who are responsible in some way for work near or around high-pressure gas pipelines. The research uncovered perceptions of risk from project personnel {{in various parts of the}} supply chain, couched in terms of project delays, legal and <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations,</b> as well as reputation management. The research demonstrates that, whilst damage to buried assets is recognised as something to be avoided, awareness of the potential for major disaster is poor. Further, supply chain contractual structures based on &rsquo;pay per meter&rsquo; and risk control strategies relying solely on enforcement and procedural compliance, create a safety environment that is ineffective and dangerous. Responsibility for risk is shifted down the supply chain and yet field personnel are exposed to incentives for timely project completion.

This research project aims to enhance the safety strategies regarding third party pipeline strikes by giving the pipeline sector a greater understanding of the motivations and priorities of those who work around pipeline assets and so how to work with them to achieve better outcomes. Using data gathered from more than 70 in-depth interviews, we explore empirically alternate understandings of risk amongst a range of stakeholders responsible for work near or around high-pressure gas transmission pipelines in Australia. Outside the pipeline sector, much of the work around pipelines is conducted by those at the bottom of long chains of contractors and sub-contractors. We discuss perceptions of risk held by a range of third party actors whose activities have the potential to threaten gas pipeline integrity. We compare these views with gas pipeline industry perceptions of risk, couched in terms of asset management, public safety, legal and <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations,</b> and reputation management. This paper focuses on how financial risk and so also management of the potential for pipeline strikes is shifted down the third party contractor chain. The data shows that third party contractors feel the time and cost impact of design or project changes most immediately. Consequently, strikes or near misses may result as sub-contractors seek to avoid perceived &# 039;unnecessary&# 039; time delays along with the associated financial impact. We argue that efforts to reduce the potential for pipeline strike need to be targeted at structural changes, rather than simply aimed at worker risk perception and enforcement of safety compliance strategies...|$|R
40|$|In {{the wake}} of the sub-prime crisis of 2008, the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority issued the Solvency II directive, aiming at {{replacing}} the obsolete Solvency I framework by 2016. Among the quantitative requirements of Solvency II, a measure for an insurance firms solvency risk, the solvency risk capital, is found. It aims at establishing the amount of equity the company needs to hold to be able to meet its <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations</b> with a probability of 0. 995 over the coming year. The SCR of a company is essentially built up by the SCR induced by a set of quantifiable risks. Among these, risks originating from the take up rate of contractual options, lapse risks, are included. In this thesis, the contractual options of a life insurer have been identified and risk factors aiming at capturing the risks arising are suggested. It has been concluded that a risk factor estimating the size of mass transfer events captures the risk arising through the resulting rescaling of the balance sheet. Further, a risk factor modeling the deviation of the Company's assumption for the yearly transfer rate is introduced to capture the risks induced by the characteristics of traditional life insurance and unit-linked insurance contracts upon transfer. The risk factors are modeled in a manner to introduce co-dependence with equity returns as well as interest rates of various durations and the model parameters are estimated using statistical methods for Norwegian transfer-frequency data obtained from Finans Norge. The univariate and multivariate properties of the models are investigated in a scenario setting and it is concluded the the suggested models provide predominantly plausible results for the mass-lapse risk factors. However, the performance of the models for the risk factors aiming at capturing deviations in the transfer assumptions are questionable, why two means of increasing its validity have been proposed...|$|R
40|$|Increasing private {{participation}} in space activities {{is one of}} the most farreaching developments relevant for international space law today. The most comprehensive consequence of such private {{participation in}} a legal sense is in fact the necessity to establish a national space legislation of some kind, in view of the international obligations arising under responsibility and liability for the state relative to the consequences of these private activities. The rather recent addition in 1993 of two states, the Russian Federation and the Republic of South Africa, to the previously existing number of three states (the United States, Sweden and the United Kingdom) in possession of national space legislation is therefore clear proof of the aforementioned development. The paper will try to provide a summary description of the two pieces of national space legislation from the perspective of international space law. After a short introduction to the domestic circumstances in which the legislations have been established, analysis will focus therefore on the manner in which the two national space laws actually operate in elaboration of international responsibility and international liability for space activities. Reference will be had in this respect primarily to the respective scope of the two laws, both with regard to the activities concerned and with regard to the entities concerned. Furthermore, with an eye to the three older national space laws, the measure of inclusion or absence of a licensing system, with related problems of derogation of liability and <b>insurance</b> <b>obligations,</b> will be discussed. Also, the extent to which a few fundamental obligations found in the international space treaties, such as those related to peaceful uses of space and environmental issues, are reflected in the two laws will be evaluated. By means of the resulting conclusions, a summary evaluation may be made of the two respective national space laws, and the way in which they deal with the general problem of containing the risks inherent in private involvement in space activities by juridical means, that is by binding private entities to theinternational obligations of space law...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{builds a}} multiperiod, general {{equilibrium}} framework for analyzing the macroeconomic effects of financial reforms {{in developing countries}} {{and the costs of}} maintaining official safety nets under the financial system during such reforms. While a financial liberalization yields efficiency gains, adverse macroeconomic effects can arise if the creditworthiness of the nonfinancial sector is weak. In this situation, financial liberalization may also increase the authorities’ expected deposit <b>insurance</b> funding <b>obligations</b> even with strong prudential supervision. Moreover, given the distortions in a repressed financial system, an increase in the required bank capital-asset ratio may increase the funding obligations associated with deposit insurance, particularly when the debt-servicing capacity of nonfinancial firms is low.
