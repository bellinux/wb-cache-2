25|$|Natural {{electrostatic}} phenomena {{are most}} <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> an occasional annoyance in seasons of low humidity, {{but can be}} destructive and harmful in some situations (e.g. electronics manufacturing).

25|$|Masks {{are also}} <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> pieces of kit {{associated}} with practical functions, usually protective. There {{has been a}} proliferation of such masks recently {{but there is a}} long history of protective armour and even medical masks to ward off plague. The contrast with performance masks is not always clear-cut. Ritual and theatrical masks themselves can be considered to be practical, and protective masks in a sports context in particular are often designed to enhance the appearance of the wearer.|$|E

25|$|Hồ chicken (gà Hồ) is a breed {{originating}} in Bắc Ninh Province. Gà Hồ is a distinctly Vietnamese rare breed of chicken, <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> a symbol in Vietnam. According to folklore, the chicken (particularly the roosters) have the five qualities {{of a man}} of honour: literacy, martial arts, physical strength, humanity and loyalty. The Gà Hồ rooster rising himself to welcome the sun {{is used as a}} symbol for the 3rd Asian Indoor Games, which were held in Vietnam from the 30th of October till the 8th of November 2009. The symbolism {{in the context of the}} AIGs is that the rising rooster linked to the readiness of the sports industry of Vietnam to host this major event.|$|E
25|$|<b>Familiar</b> <b>as</b> {{an ancient}} {{symbol of the}} region, the Triskelion is also {{featured}} on Greek coins of Syracuse, such as coins of Agathocles (317–289 BC).The symbol dates back to when Sicily was part of Magna Graecia, the colonial extension of Greece beyond the Aegean. The triskelion was revived, as a neoclassic – and non-Bourbon – emblem for the new Napoleonic Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, by Joachim Murat in 1808. Pliny the Elder attributes {{the origin of the}} triskelion of Sicily to the triangular form of the island, the ancient Trinacria, which consists of three large capes equidistant from each other, pointing in their respective directions, the names of which were Pelorus, Pachynus, and Lilybæum. The three legs of the triskelion are also reminiscent of Hephaestus's three-legged tables that ran by themselves, as mentioned in Iliad xviii.|$|E
25|$|The {{tone of the}} {{programme}} {{in series}} one and two, and much of series three, mixed poignant drama and action sequences with offbeat comic moments, {{and many of these}} tales had a grittier feel to them than the more light-hearted storylines that would go on to be more <b>familiar.</b> <b>As</b> the series progressed over 15 years, more emphasis was placed on the comedic aspects of the minder-principal relationship, and the show became more a comedy driven by a dramatic plot. Social satire played a strong part throughout the series, grounded in the cinematic and social ethos of the 1980s. In the earlier series, Terry would succeed in seducing a 'dolly bird', resulting in at least one scene of female semi-nudity per average episode, though as the series became more popular these instances were reduced (and some repeat viewings, even those post-watershed, toned such scenes down). Although always an element of the series, the fights - common and brutal in early episodes - were also toned down and became less frequent.|$|E

25|$|Many local {{variants}} of the Greek alphabet {{were employed in}} ancient Greece during the archaic and early classical periods, until they were replaced by the classical 24-letter alphabet that is the standard today, around 400 BC. All forms of the Greek alphabet were originally based on the shared inventory of the 22 symbols of the Phoenician alphabet, {{with the exception of}} the letter Samekh, whose Greek counterpart Xi (Ξ) was used only in a sub-group of Greek alphabets, and with the common addition of Upsilon (Υ) for the vowel /u, ū/. The local, so-called epichoric, alphabets differed in many ways: in the use of the consonant symbols Χ, Φ and Ψ; in the use of the innovative long vowel letters (Ω and Η), in the absence or presence of Η in its original consonant function (/h/); in the use or non-use of certain archaic letters (Ϝ = /w/, Ϙ = /k/, Ϻ = /s/); and in many details of the individual shapes of each letter. The system now <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> the standard 24-letter Greek alphabet was originally the regional variant of the Ionian cities in Asia Minor. It was officially adopted in Athens in 403 BC and in most of the rest of the Greek world by the middle of the 4th century BC.|$|E
25|$|It {{was common}} {{knowledge}} , {{not only that}} the decisions of the Judicial Committee in the Canadian cases had not given widespread satisfaction, but also that the Constitution of the United States was a subject entirely unfamiliar to English lawyers, while to Australian publicists it was almost as <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> the British Constitution. It was known that, even if there should be any members of the Judicial Committee familiar with the subject, it was quite uncertain whether they would form members of a Board that might be called upon to determine a question on appeal from an Australian Court, by which it must necessarily be dealt with in the first instance. It could not be predicted of the Board, which would sit to entertain an appeal, that it would be constituted with any regard to the special familiarity of its members with the subject. And no disrespect is implied in saying that the eminent lawyers who constituted the Judicial Committee were not regarded either as being familiar with the history or conditions of the remoter portions of the Empire, or as having any sympathetic understanding of the aspirations of the younger communities which had long enjoyed the privilege of self-government. On the other hand, the founders of the Australian Constitution were familiar with the part which the Supreme Court of the United States, constituted of Judges imbued with the spirit of American nationality, and knowing that the nation must work out its own destiny under the Constitution as framed, or as amended from time to time, had played {{in the development of the}} nation, and the harmonious working of its political institutions.|$|E

500|$|The plot {{had become}} too <b>familiar,</b> <b>as</b> film {{historian}} Douglas Brode notes, and it [...] "seemed likely the play would be put away in a drawer [...]" [...] Yet Elliott Nugent's film, The Cat and the Canary (1939), proved successful. Nugent [...] "had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs." [...] The film was produced by Paramount and starred comedic actor Bob Hope. Hope played Wally Campbell, a character based on Creighton Hale's performance as Paul Jones. One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging. In later years, Universal themselves acquired {{the rights to the}} 1939 version.|$|E

According to an interview, Jules Verne relished reading the Baron stories as a child, and used them as inspiration for his own adventure novels.

500|$|Rilke {{depicted}} this infinite, transcendental beauty {{with the}} symbol of angels. However, he {{did not use the}} traditional Christian interpretation of angels. [...] He sought to utilize a symbol of the angel that was secular, divorced from religious doctrine and embodied a tremendous transcendental beauty. [...] In this, however, Rilke commented that he was greatly influenced by the depiction of angels found in Islam. For Rilke, {{the symbol of}} the angel represents a perfection that is [...] "beyond human contradictions and limitations" [...] in a [...] "higher level of reality in the invisible." [...] Where there is incongruity that adds to mankind's despair and anxiety is due to [...] human nature keeping us clinging to the visible and the <b>familiar.</b> <b>As</b> mankind encounters the invisible and unknown higher levels represented by these angels, the experience of the invisible will be [...] "terrifying" [...] (in German, schrecklich).|$|E

Bardeen said, [...] "Her authoritative flow is matched only by the evolving landscape of beats that back her -- and Ivy, unlike some of her peers, has not been seduced by the European club scene". Ben-Yehuda also noted, [...] "The set presents a more diverse range of musical styles, from bachata to R to even a poppy ballad ("Cuando")". The iTunes Notes for the album say, [...] "True to its title, her seventh album is rich in melodrama, boasting grand synthesizer runs and heart-wrenching themes of love and betrayal. That's her strength. She's her own yin and yang-strong yet soft, swaggering yet tender." [...] The Editor Notes for the album claimed Drama Queen to be an [...] "adventurous set" [...] and [...] "full of sonic surprises".|$|E
500|$|Chess is {{believed}} to have originated in Eastern India, c. 280–550, in the Gupta Empire, where its early form in the 6thcentury was known as chaturaṅga (...) , literally four divisions – infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariotry, represented by the pieces that would evolve into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively. Thence it spread eastward and westward along the Silk Road. The earliest evidence of chess is found in the nearby Sassanid Persia around 600, where the game came to be known by the name chatrang. Chatrang was taken up by the Muslim world after the Islamic conquest of Persia (633–44), where it was then named shatranj, with the pieces largely retaining their Persian names. In Spanish [...] "shatranj" [...] was rendered as ajedrez ("al-shatranj"), in Portuguese as xadrez, and in Greek as ζατρίκιον (zatrikion, which comes directly from the Persian chatrang), but in the rest of Europe it was replaced by versions of the Persian shāh ("king"), which was <b>familiar</b> <b>as</b> an exclamation and became the English words [...] "check" [...] and [...] "chess".|$|E
