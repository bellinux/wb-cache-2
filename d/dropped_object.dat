Our method works in single views and exploits prior information of the scene, such as geometry or the fact that a number of false alarms are caused by known objects, such as humans. The proposed approach builds <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> candidates by analyzing blobs obtained with a multi-layer background subtraction approach. The created <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> candidates are then characterized both by appearance and by temporal aspects such as the estimated drop time. Next, we incorporate prior knowledge about the possible sizes and positions of dropped objects through an efficient filtering approach. Finally, the output of a human detector is exploited over in order to filter out static objects that are likely to be humans that remain still. Experimental results on the publicly available PETS 2006 datasets and on several long sequences recorded in metro stations show the effectiveness of the proposed approach. Furthermore, our approach can operate in real-time. ...|$|E
40|$|Master's thesis in Offshore {{structural}} engineeringThere {{is always}} a risk of an object being dropped during offshore lifting operations. Any underlying structure or equipment might be severely damaged, and in worst case, lives might be lost. Consequently, structures which might be subjected to an accidental event with an annual probability of 10 - 4 are required to be designed in accidental limit state (ALS). Design in ALS often requires for the structural response {{to be taken into}} the plastic range, which means that nonlinear analysis methods must used. This master thesis deals with nonlinear structural response. For one specific case, results from hand calculations are compared to results obtained from nonlinear finite element analysis and evaluated as to give an indication of the usefulness of simplified methods to predict nonlinear structural response for the specific structure. The second objective of this master thesis is to compare two different ways of modelling a <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> scenario in a finite element analysis program. The first, method 1, includes a model of the <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> where a hyperelastic spring element is introduced to establish contact between the falling object and the underlying structure. In method 2, the node representing the point of impact is given an initial velocity equal to the velocity at impact for the same load scenario as in method 1.

Impact load in one node is compared to impact load in several nodes in the middle of the plate and in the beams. A DOP structure with additional beam is also model for reducing the strain and deflection. The DOP structure with additional beams is analyzed with impact in one node in the middle of the beams at the edge and the beam in the middle of the DOP structure. The DOP structure is also compared to a DOP structure without plates with respect to strain and deflection. There is also one analysis where the DOP structure is designed with aluminium for comparing with steel. Aluminium is about 1 / 3 of the weight of the steel. The analyses are done by the nonlinear finite element program named USFOS, which also have dynamic capabilities. The DOP structure is first modelled in the structural analysis and design program Sesam GeniE. There are designed one original model, one model with modification for reducing the strain and deflection and one model without plates. The impact loads is designed as node mass with velocity for simulated the <b>dropped</b> <b>object.</b> In analysis with a mass of 7000 kg falling 3 meters acting in one node the maximum strain is 18. 2 %. 18. 2 % is achieved when the impact is in the middle of the beam at the edge of the DOP structure. The maximum strain is reduced to 12. 5 % when the mass is distributed evenly in three nodes. A DOP structure with added beams with the impact load in one node in the idle of the beam at the edge has maximum strain of 9. 9 %. With the extra beams in the DOP structure the beam span will be reduced, therefore lower strain and deflection. The maximum expected strain in the middle of the plate is 17. 9 % with a mass of 7000 kg falling 3 meters. If the mass is distributed over several nodes the maximum strain is reduced to 8. 7 % in the middle of the plate. For reducing the maximum strain in the plate the thickness can be increased.

40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringThe {{objective}} of this Master’s thesis was to investigate whether or not using protection covers made of reinforced concrete is a viable option for protection of subsea installations on the seabed. The main focus of the thesis is on the structural design of the cover. The original problem, raised by Subsea 7, was that in shallow waters of about 100 m depth, the protection covers made of GRP experience problems with on-bottom stability due to the hydrodynamic forces from currents and waves. Unless tons of ballast steel is added to increase {{the mass of the}} cover, and rock-dumping {{on the sides of the}} cover is performed, the covers are prone to be unstable or possibly moved by the currents and waves. The hypothesis behind the thesis is that the slightly higher density of concrete and the thicker walls of the concrete covers, as well as some slight changes to the typical shape of the cover, will make them heavy enough to be stable on the seabed on its own without added ballast weight and rock-dumping. The type of cover assessed in the thesis is a simple tunnel or arch cover, which is typically used to cover pipelines or spools. The inner diameter of the cover was set to 2 m, so that it can protect pipelines or spools up to size 16 ” with the necessary clearances to walls and roof. A 3 D model of the reinforced concrete cover was created, and a finite element analysis performed using the software Ansys® Workbench, Release 14. 5. The trawl design loads of 300 kN from NORSOK standard U- 001 was applied to the cover. A dynamic <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> simulation on the reinforced concrete cover model was also performed. The analyses showed that the concrete protection covers had sufficient strength to withstand the force from the trawl board and to withstand the energy from the dropped objects without damaging the product underneath. A 2 D beam model of the cover was created in STAAD. Pro V 8 i in order to get the design forces and moments in the cover. The concrete protection cover was designed according to the concrete standard Eurocode 2. This design resulted in the necessary amount of reinforcement to withstand the design forces and moments, and proved that the cross-section of concrete and reinforcement of the protection cover was able to withstand the design loads from trawl gear impacts. A full scale <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> test of impact energies 5 kJ, 20 kJ, 30 kJ and 50 kJ, according to NORSOK standard U- 001 was performed on doubly reinforced concrete protection covers of 215 mm thickness and inner radius of 1000 mm. The test was performed on concrete covers provided by Multiblokk AS. The objects used in the test had masses of 140 kg, 550 kg, 850 kg and 1400 kg and was dropped onto the cover from approximately 3, 7 m height. An initial test was performed on gravel on Multiblokk AS’ premises, and the four main tests were performed with the cover submerged in the basin at the laboratories at the University of Stavanger. The covers in the main tests cracked slightly, but none were penetrated or collapsed. The <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> tests proved that the strength of the protection covers was more than enough to withstand the <b>dropped</b> <b>object</b> energies, and that the initial design of the cover is suitable to build upon further. Based on the results from the structural assessment of the cover, the tests and analyses, the concept of using concrete protection covers was found to be a feasible concept that should be investigated further and in more detail. Its heavy weight, high strength and the possibility of liberation from rock-dump requirements gives the concrete protection cover a competitive edge that is well worth exploring further...|$|E
