40|$|Workflow {{models have}} been used and refined for years to execute {{processes}} within organisations. To deal with collaborative processes (choreographies) these internal workflow models have to be aligned with the <b>external</b> behaviour <b>advertised</b> through Web service interfaces. However, traditional workflow management systems (WfMS) do not offer this functionality. Simply sharing and merging process models is often not possible, because workflow management lacks a widely accepted standard theory for workflow models. Multiple research and standardisation efforts to integrate different workflow theories have been proposed over the years. XPDL is {{the most widely used}} standard for process model interchange and supported by over 80 systems. However, XPDL also lacks the possibility to relate a workflow model to its possible choreography interface abstractions. To remedy this situation, we propose to abstract the XPDL model to a higher-level model, perform the integration and the compaction algorithms at that level and then ground it back to the desired choreography models. We develop and use an integrated ontology which is based on the XPDL standard for this purpose. To facilitate the abstraction and grounding, we present a mapping procedure to automatically translate XPDL and BPMN workflow models into this ontology. After translation, these models are annotated with a parameterised role model and other collaborative properties. We present a compaction procedure that automatically maps the annotated models into external choreography interfaces that expose only the relevant information for a particular partner collaboration. Our procedure is agnostic with respect to the target choreography model. We demonstrate our approach using WSMO choreographies which enables us to automatically generate interface models from any WfMSs that supports XPDL export. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} {{supported}} by grant 10 / 3000 / 07 from the National Institute for Health Research. OBJECTIVES: To explore how e-cigarettes are being promoted at point of sale in the UK and how retailers perceive market trends. SETTING: Fixed retail outlets subject to a ban on the display of tobacco products. PARTICIPANTS: Observational audit of all stores selling tobacco products (n= 96) in 4 Scottish communities, conducted over 2 waves 12  months apart (2013 - 2014), and qualitative interviews with small retailers (n= 25) in 4 matched communities. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The audit measured e-cigarette display characteristics, advertising materials and proximity to other products, and differences by area-level disadvantage. Interviews explored retailers' perceptions of e-cigarette market opportunities and risks, and customer responses. RESULTS: The number of e-cigarette point-of-sale display units and number of brands displayed increased between waves. E-cigarettes were displayed close to products of interest to children in 36 % of stores. Stores in more affluent areas were less likely to have <b>external</b> e-cigarette <b>advertising</b> than those in deprived areas. Although e-cigarettes delivered high profit margins, retailers were confused by the diversity of brands and products, and uncertain of the sector's viability. Some customers were perceived to purchase e-cigarettes as cessation aids, and others, particularly low-income smokers, as a cheaper adjunct to conventional tobacco. CONCLUSIONS: E-cigarette point-of-sale displays and number of brands displayed increased over 12  months, a potential cause for concern given their lack of regulation. Further scrutiny is needed of the content and effects of such advertising, and the potentially normalising effects of placing e-cigarettes next to products of interest to children.

50|$|By using Internet platforms, {{businesses}} can create competitive advantage through various means. To reach the maximum potential of digital marketing, firms use social media as its main tool {{to create a}} channel of information. Through this a business can create {{a system in which}} they are able to pinpoint behavioral patterns of clients and feedback on their needs. This means of content has shown to have a larger impingement on those who have a long-standing relationship with the firm and with consumers who are relatively active social media users. Relative to this, creating a social media page will further increase relation quality between new consumers and existing consumers as well as consistent brand reinforcement therefore improving brand awareness resulting in a possible rise for consumers up the Brand Awareness Pyramid. Although there may be inconstancy with product images; maintaining a successful social media presence requires a business to be consistent in interactions through creating a two way feed of information; firms consider their content based on the feedback received through this channel, this {{is a result of the}} environment being dynamic due to the global nature of the internet. Effective use of digital marketing can result in relatively lowered costs in relation to traditional means of marketing; Lowered <b>external</b> service costs, <b>advertising</b> costs, promotion costs, processing costs, interface design costs and control costs.|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} work {{is to develop a}} {{methodology}} to optimize advertisement targeting inside the Spotify platform. By understanding the relevance of advertisements to users, the advertisement efficacy can be improved leading to an overall reduced advertisement load, to a better user experience, and to an increased advertisement revenue. Three types of advertisement are delivered inside the Spotify platform: house advertisements, which promote the Spotify premium subscription, label advertisements, which promote artists and albums and commercial advertisements, which promote external brands or products. For each type, machine learning models were implemented to optimize the matching of advertisements to users. The house advertisement targeting focused on maximizing the conversions of users from free to premium subscriptions. Unlike traditional advertisement targeting models, which focus on estimating the user probability of converting, the proposed approach focuses on estimating the change in probability of converting when an advertisement is delivered, so that only impressions producing a true uplift are delivered. The targeting of label advertisements optimized the number of users starting to listen to the advertised music. The implemented approach delivers relevant advertisements based on an evaluation of the affinity between the user's music and the advertised music and on the user's listening behavior. The commercial advertisement targeting optimized the number of clicks on advertisements. Given that commercial advertisements <b>advertise</b> <b>external</b> products, the main challenge faced was the lack of relevant data to inform the targeting. The implemented approach tries to deal with this problem by combining feature based methods with collaborative filtering methods. The main contribution of this thesis work is the implementation of machine learning models to improve advertisement targeting inside the Spotify platform. In particular, the proposed methodology uses uplift modeling, with a modified approach to handle bias in the training data, and also makes use of meta-data to better understand the context of the campaigns...|$|R

40|$|Mass-consumption of {{clothing}} {{is an important}} contributor to climate change and other environmental problems. This study aims to develop a more comprehensive understanding of the complexities of consumption by looking at two main factors. Firstly, what different motivations are at play for consumption {{of clothing}}, and how these motivations intersect and interact. Secondly, how elements of consumer behaviour links to group and individual identity, {{and the role of}} clothes in the creation and negotiation of these identities. Lastly the research seeks to better understand linkages between clothes consumption and barriers to behaviour change towards lessening the impact of consumption on the environment. The data is collected through focus group interviews with young consumers in Norway aged 16 - 18. This provides in-depth qualitative data from consumers in the process of creating their consumer patterns and practices. The findings demonstrate a variety of overlapping and complex motivations for consumption, some of which are hidden from the consumer. The motivations are a mix of internal and external influences. The internal influences include norms and habits, while the sources of <b>external</b> influence include <b>advertising,</b> media and celebrities, as well as parents and peer groups. The relationship between internal and external motivations, or individual agency and structural influence, is complex and filled with tension. There is a clear pattern of contradiction between the consumers wanting to display individuality through consumption of clothing, and wanting to display group belonging. In the mind of the consumer this contradiction is either not apparent or not problematic. The findings suggest that the relationship between consumption of clothing and identity creation is a tenuous one. Clothes are important for identity creation as a form of communication, but only up to a certain degree, and it is not always a successful tool for creating and maintaining identities. The complexity of consumer motivations apparent in this study has implications for policy measures directed towards reduction of consumption. The research shows that there is potential for behaviour change based on the false satisfaction of certain social functions through consumer goods. M-IE...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 50). Human resource Management is very crucial {{for the success of}} any company, because the success of any organization depends on its Human Resource department. It is the heart of any organization. So in this competitive business world, the Human Resource department of any organization has to be well structured and strong formulated. In this report, I want to find out a well-structured HRM process, which is very important for any organization in this changing business world. For this, I want to compare the HR process of ACI Ltd. with one multinational co. like Novartis (Bangladesh) Ltd. and one indigenous co. name as Square. By interviewing, I {{want to know about the}} recruitment and selection process, training method, performance appraisal and employee benefit of the concerned three renowned companies. From which a standard HRM process bring out and give specific guidelines of operations of HRD with a vision to ensure quality policy and maintain the expected standards of operations of any organization. The recruitment processes of ACI Limited starts from line manager/dept. head and end to the Managing Director. Through HRD both internal and external factors influence their recruitment process. The co. mostly recruits their employees from <b>external</b> sources like <b>advertising,</b> employment agency. The recruitment processes of Square starts from line manager and end to the MD, as like as ACI Limited. No factors can affect their recruitment process. The external sources are very effective in recruitment such as advertising, employment agencies and campus visit. The recruitment processes of Novartis (Bangladesh) Ltd. starts from line manager and end to the HRD. The internal factors influence their recruitment process. They recruit the employees from both internal and external sources. The selection procedure of ACI, Novartis and Square more or less are same. They use written test, IQ test, and interview and salary negotiation. ACI Ltd. measures their employee performance by Balance Score Card or Action Plan for this the co. uses the method of MBO and 360 -degree evaluation. By Job Description Square measure their employee performance and by the method of MBO the co. acquire selfassessment in their organization. Novartis also measure their employee performance by task oriented and behavior oriented way. MBO, 360 -degree feedback and SMART are also the method of measuring employee performance in Novartis. The co. provides benefit such as gratuity, provident fund, medical facility, festival bonus, loan facility, annual leave, etc. These facilities more or less are same in the concerned three organizations, but their procedure is different. From the comparison of ACI Ltd. with Square and Novartis I can find out some strengths and weaknesses which are The recruitment planning is well structured in ACI Ltd. than Square and Novartis.  The recruitment planning of ACI Ltd. is very strong than Square and Novartis, but the procedure is lengthy.  The selection procedure is well structured in the concerned three companies.  The performance appraisal method i. e. BSC and 360 -degree evaluation are very effective in ACI Ltd. whereas MBO in Square and 360 -degree evaluation in Novartis. Communication gap exists in the concerned three companies.  Though employee benefit is not so good in ACI Ltd. as like as Square and Novartis. But their medical facility and annual leave are well than other two companies. To overcome the weakness of ACI Ltd. some recommendations are given The co. has to reduce the time length to recruit employees.  The co. has to go campus visit for employee recruitment.  The co. has to reduce the communication gap.  The employee benefits of ACI Ltd. have to be updated.

5000|$|Launched 3 January 1982 by {{print media}} editor Edilio Rusconi, Italia 1 was born {{from the idea}} of a network {{supported}} by twenty regional broadcasting stations, some owned by Rusconi himself and others simply affiliated to broadcast throughout Italian territory on the 'ploy' of interconnection. The lead broadcasting station is Milan-based Antenna Nord, but Rome's Quinta Rete also has an important role. Lillo Tombolini is the executive director. The channel's presenter is a young Gabriella Golia, who was already the face of Antenna Nord. Rusconi's growing national channel starts its programming at noon, with a segment dedicated to children, during which various anime series are broadcast, like Lady Oscar and Lalabel, as well as successful original television series, like Star Trek, then in the early afternoon air-time is given to region-specific broadcasts, later restarting the national broadcast with more television series and the mid-afternoon children's programming block, Bim Bum Bam (offering episodes from numerous cartoon series, predominantly Japanese, like Chobin the Star Child, Sport Billy, Hello Spank, Squirrel Banner, Demetan Croaker, The Boy Frog, Akaki Chi no Eleven). In the late afternoon the channel again broadcasts from local stations and an hour later airs a television series episode (like Paper Moon). Generally, in the early evening two films and one television series is broadcast. The network also offers plenty of air-time to sport programs dedicated to soccer, boxing, basketball and motor racing, including Andrea De Adamich's Grand Prix.Prime time hours were dedicated to series like Falcon Crest, Kojak, The Big Valley, Project UFO, and Mork & Mindy. On 23 April 1982 an official agreement was made between Gruppo Rusconi and the American network CBS for technical assistance and program sharing. However, only a few months after its appearance on a national scale funds began to dwindle, mostly due to exorbitant costs of managing broadcast transmission systems, something a print editing house like Rusconi probably wasn't aware of, but also due to the aggressive advertising policy from its main rival network, Canale 5. In fact, Rusconi's network relied on an <b>external</b> <b>advertising</b> provider, la Publikompass, to sell advertising space while Berlusconi's channel took advantage of owning its own advertising provider, Publitalia, which could easily personalize ad packages to clients using dumping practices. On 6 September 1982 Rusconi signed a collaboration agreement with Silvio Berlusconi, the owner of Canale 5, mainly focusing on a common policy for the management of advertising limits but also concerning the communal use of high frequency networks and the sharing of some programs.However, on 30 November of that same year, the Rusconi group are forced to sell the network for about 29 billion lire (approximately €15 Million) to Berlusconi, who merges it with [...] "Rete 10", also owned by Berlusconi, to found the new Italia 1, that according to the Fininvest company is oriented for a young audience.|$|E
