40|$|In this study, failure {{analysis}} of a crankshaft was carried out. The crankshaft made of nodular graphite cast iron was used in a gasoline engine. The cracks propagated axially on surface of the 4 th <b>pin</b> <b>journal.</b> Microscopic observation {{was conducted on the}} surface of journals. Mechanical and metallurgical properties of the crankshaft including chemical composition, micro-hardness, tensile properties and roughness were studied and compared with the specified properties of the crankshaft materials. As a result of the analyses, the main reason of failure was determined as thermal fatigue because of contact of journal and bearing surface. This condition leads to the formation and growth of fatigue cracks. The contact is probably resulted from defective lubrication or high operating oil temperature. In addition, the contact caused scratches on surface of the 4 th <b>pin</b> <b>journal</b> and 5 th main journal...|$|R
40|$|As the {{key part}} of {{internal}} combustion engines, crankshaft with high efficiency and accuracy processing {{has always been the}} target of the engine manufacturer’s pursuit. Grinding is used to obtain the ultimate dimensional accuracy and surface finish in the crankshaft machining. Grinding of the main <b>journals</b> and the <b>pin</b> <b>journals</b> can be accomplished in a single clamping operation by CNC Tangential Point Tracing grinding technology. However, the chatter in the grinding process is harmful to the precision and surface quality. In this paper, stability lobe diagram is developed to predict the grinding chatter. First the dynamic model of Tangential Point Tracing grinding system is established. Then the limit formula of the critical grinding depth is calculated and the stability lobe diagram of the grinding system is presented. Finally, the validation experiments are carried out on the crankshaft grinding machine and the results are consistent with the calculation...|$|R

50|$|In the {{semi-floating}} configuration, the pin {{is usually}} fixed {{relative to the}} piston by an interference fit with the journal in the piston. (This replaced the earlier set screw method.) The {{connecting rod small end}} bearing thus acts as the bearing alone. In this configuration, only the small end bearing requires a bearing surface, if any. If needed, this is provided by either electroplating the small end bearing journal with a suitable metal, or more usually by inserting a sleeve bearing or needle bearing into the eye of the small end, which has an interference fit with the aperture of the small end. During overhaul, it is usually possible to replace this bearing sleeve if it is badly worn. The reverse configuration, fixing the gudgeon pin to the connecting rod instead of to the piston, is implemented using an interference fit with the small end eye instead, with the gudgeon <b>pin</b> <b>journals</b> in the piston functioning as bearings. This arrangement is usually more difficult to manufacture and service because two bearing surfaces or inserted sleeves complicate the design. In addition, the pin must be precisely set so that the small end eye is central. Because of thermal expansion considerations, this arrangement was more usual for single-cylinder engines as opposed to multiple cylinder engines with long cylinder blocks and crankcases, until precision manufacturing became more commonplace.|$|R
