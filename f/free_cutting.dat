The study utilized an experimental design. A sample of 30 students was drawn from the target population of 550 Home Economics students of Federal College of Education (Technical) Omoku and University of Education, Port Harcourt. A systematic sampling technique was used to select the sample. Instrument used for the study was a 4 -point likert scale questionnaire of strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed and strongly disagreed. Values were assigned as follows: SA- 4, A- 3, D- 2, and SD- 1. The data collected was systematically analysed using mean and t-test. The three hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 level of significance. Findings revealed that a female gown made with adapted patterns fits better on the shoulder, sleeve, bust, waist, and hip than a gown made with <b>free</b> hand <b>cutting.</b> Findings also revealed that the gown made with adapted pattern look more outstanding and dressy than the one made with <b>free</b> hand <b>cutting.</b> Based on these findings, some recommendations were made. It was recommended that: Graduates of Home Economics that specialize in Clothing and Textiles should be encouraged to establish industries where they can make patterns according to contemporary fashion in sizes for sale. There should be an awareness programme organized by Home Economists to dressmakers who uses <b>free</b> hand <b>cutting</b> to make use of adapted patterns in sewing.

During such cutting process, strong fibers are bended far more intensively than the weak matrix and an interfacial debonding between them occurs under the machined surface.

One of the perspective ways to diminish such debonding is to apply special cutting means. On {{the first stage of}} the problem study it is recommended to apply calculation and, first of all, numerical calculation methods. Attempts to apply the finite element method have presented some difficulties. Therefore, the SPH method has been previously used as the study basis. Calculations are performed using three design models: free orthogonal and oblique cutting (including cutting with two opposite located wedges), <b>free</b> orthogonal <b>cutting</b> with the advanced wedge and, at last, <b>free</b> orthogonal <b>cutting</b> with the advanced roller. The results of calculations show that the last mentioned model and oblique cutting hold are promising.

40|$|For decades <b>free</b> <b>cutting</b> steels {{have been}} alloyed with lead {{in order to}} improve {{machinability}}. Enhanced machinability is characterised by low tool wear, short breaking chips, high surface quality and low cutting forces. Although the lead content in steels is comparably low, leaded steels are under threat for environmental reasons. The EU-directive on end-of-life vehicles generally prohibits the use of lead for machinability enhancement but currently an exception for steels alloyed with up to 0. 35 % lead exists. Within the present work it was investigated if alternative alloying elements are capable of substituting for lead in terms of machinability. The machinability of different alloyed <b>free</b> <b>cutting,</b> carbon and case carburising steels was analysed.

The article contains the definition of rational parameters of cutting disk tools as well as power and energy parameters of the destruction process by cutting disks and by executive body of the coal cutter. The rational geometric parameters of cutting discs are specified. It was found that each step of cutting with a minimum depth of penetration has its own maximum height of bench outcrop.
