5|$|As {{part of the}} {{promotion}} for the event, Hogan appeared on Hot Properties four days prior to WrestleMania, where he put host Richard Belzer into a front chinlock —a move that cuts off {{the flow of blood}} to the brain. Belzer, however, <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> unconscious and began to bleed profusely. His injury required eight stitches. Belzer later sued Hogan for $5million, but they eventually settled out of court. The night before WrestleMania, Hogan and Mr. T hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live to help promote the event.|$|E
25|$|Peralta led {{his team}} through three house-clearings before {{charging}} into the fourth house. After finding two rooms empty {{on the ground}} floor he opened a third door and was hit multiple times with AK-47 fire, leaving him severely wounded. Peralta <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> moving aside to enable the Marines behind him to return fire.|$|E
25|$|To create Breathing In/Breathing Out the two artists {{devised a}} piece in which they {{connected}} their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used {{up all of the}} available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.|$|E

Their supposed underworld relatives, the malicious and vagrant Lemures, might be placated with midnight offerings of black beans and spring water.|$|E
25|$|The next {{match was}} the Intercontinental Championship match between Jeff Hardy, and Carlito, who earned 62% of the vote. After a handshake, both men attamepted quick pinning combinations. Carlito countered a Swanton Bomb by raising his knees. Carlito {{performed}} a Springboard Corkscrew Senton for a near-fall. Hardy {{was able to}} perform Whisper in the Wind. Hardy {{climbed to the top}} rope, and when Carlito attempted to stop him, he was pushed and <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> Hardy performed the Swanton Bomb to retain the title.|$|E
25|$|Lowrey then persuaded a friend, Colonel William C. Falkner, {{to run his}} {{railroad}} {{near the}} college. Since he was a major shareholder of Falkner's Railroad, the plan was soon carried out. The school became quite a success and 3 generations of Lowrey's became presidents of the school himself, two of his sons and a grandson. Following several years of teaching at the Blue Mountain College, Lowrey became very sick and, in 1882, his doctors alerted him that his heart was very weak. Then, on February 27, 1885, while buying a train ticket at Middleton, Tennessee, he turned, gasped, and <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> dead.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} 1968 Olympics, Čáslavská married runner Josef Odložil, {{who had been}} a silver {{medalist}} at the 1964 Olympics in Tokyo. The ceremony, which took place at the Mexico City Cathedral, drew a crowd of thousands. They had a son, Martin, and daughter, Radka. The couple divorced in 1987. In 1993, her son and ex-husband were involved in an altercation with Martin allegedly punching Josef; he <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and struck his head, leading to his death. Čáslavská became depressed and was rarely seen in public afterwards. Martin Odložil was convicted of causing his father's death but was granted a pardon by Václav Havel in 1997. Čáslavská eventually overcame her depression (which she had been fighting for about 15 years), and returned to both social and sports lives, coaching younger gymnasts.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} avoid being delayed by the Virgin and ashamed at having failed to meet her on the Monday as agreed, Juan Diego chose another route around the hill, but the Virgin intercepted him and asked {{where he was going}} (fourth apparition); Juan Diego {{explained}} what had happened and the Virgin gently chided him for not having had recourse to her. In the words which have become the most famous phrase of the Guadalupe event and are inscribed over the main entrance to the Basilica of Guadalupe, she asked, “¿No estoy yo aquí que soy tu madre?” (Am I not here, I who am your mother?). She assured him that Juan Bernardino had now recovered and she told him to gather flowers from the top of Tepeyac Hill, which was normally barren, especially in December. Juan followed her instructions and he found Castilian roses, not native to Mexico, blooming there. The Virgin arranged the flowers in Juan's tilma, or cloak, and when Juan Diego opened his cloak before archbishop Zumárraga on December 12, the flowers <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor,</b> and on the fabric was the image of the Virgin of Guadalupe.|$|E
25|$|The {{task was}} to create a toy and market it at a show {{attended}} by Sir Alan and toy industry representatives, with the potential for it to be mass-produced and sold to raise money for Comic Relief. The men's team, led by Gerald Ratner, created a belt with clip-on slots to hold collectible figurines, that was suggested by Jonathan Ross. The women's team created a velcro suit that was intended to come in pairs and played somewhat like Twister, including a giant novelty dice that when rolled, instructed players to stick one part of their body to the other player's, with the loser being whoever <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> first. Both teams suffered internal conflicts, with Jonathan Ross forcing many of his ideas through and then not contributing to the speech that {{he was supposed to be}} writing with Jack Dee, while Patsy Palmer became frustrated with Michelle Mone's leadership of their team and very nearly quit. Conflict between Dee and Ross was presented by the BBC in a humorous fashion, and it is likely that both Dee and Ross 'played up' their conflict to entertain the viewer.|$|E

25|$|On May 7, 1995, Miller scored {{eight points}} in 8.9 seconds in Game 1 of the Eastern Conference Semifinals against the Knicks, leading the Pacers to a {{stunning}} 107–105 victory. With 18.7 seconds remaining and the Pacers trailing 105–99, Miller took the inbounds pass from Mark Jackson, made a 3-pointer, stole the inbounds pass from Anthony Mason, dribbled {{back behind the}} arc and tied the game with another 3, stunning the crowd at Madison Square Garden. On the ensuing possession, Knicks guard John Starks was fouled by Sam Mitchell. Starks missed both free throws, and although Patrick Ewing {{managed to get the}} offensive rebound, his shot was just a bit long and hit the back rim. Miller got the rebound and was fouled with 7.5 seconds left. He made both free throws. Trailing by 2, New York had one last chance to win the game, but failed to get a shot off, giving the Pacers a shocking 1–0 lead in the best-of-seven series. The Pacers outlasted the Knicks in seven games before losing to the Orlando Magic in the Conference Finals in seven games, just like the previous year. Near the end of the 1996 season, Miller <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and suffered an eye injury, leaving him unable to play in the playoffs until Game 5 of the first round against the Atlanta Hawks, where he wore goggles. The Pacers lost to the Hawks and were eliminated.|$|E
25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking forward to the next year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E
500|$|Lennon, {{bleeding}} profusely {{from external}} wounds {{and from his}} mouth, staggered up five steps to the security/reception area, saying, [...] "I'm shot, I'm shot".

The concierge, Jay Hastings, first started to make a tourniquet, but upon ripping open Lennon's blood-stained shirt and realizing the severity of the musician's multiple injuries, he covered Lennon's chest with his uniform jacket, removed his blood-covered glasses, and summoned the police.|$|E

Onassis {{wanted to have a}} committed relationship with Thyssen from their first meeting, which she initially resisted, but the deep relationship which eventually developed between the pair was resisted by Onassis's mother, who constantly sought to sabotage it. Onassis's father also sought to undermine his son's relationship by buying him a $2 million villa outside Athens, a gesture that Thyssen felt was an attempt to mold her into just another [...] "Onassis object...to be manipulated, brutalised and treated on any level and on any terms he chooses." [...] Thyssen only accepted gifts from Onassis if they were paid from the small amount that he earned.|$|E
500|$|The first {{match to}} air live was between Kane and MVP in an Inferno match.

Kane kicked MVP in the head and threw him into the ring corner. MVP escaped the ring and was unable to go past the fire, so he returned to the ring and was continuously knocked down by Kane. The finish of the match saw Kane grab MVP and force him backwards into the fire. MVP's costume caught on fire as he ran to the entrance ramp.

500|$|On February 20, 1999, Trinidad {{defended the}} welterweight {{championship}} against Pernell Whitaker, winning the fight by unanimous decision {{in a contest}} that marked his thirteenth successful defense. The fight began with both boxers displaying aggressive styles, which included excessive pushing. In the following rounds both boxers used their jabs {{most of the time}} with Trinidad gaining an advantage when Whitaker attempted to attack inside, eventually scoring a knockdown in round two. In the fourth, fifth and sixth rounds the fighters exchanged combinations. [...] Later in the fight both boxers <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> in what were ruled as [...] "accidental slips." [...] On the seventh round Whitaker displayed more offense, trading power punches with Trinidad, but the champion retained control in the fight's tempo during the eight, ninth, and tenth rounds. In the last round Whitaker, with a badly swollen right eye, displayed a purely defensive stance, avoiding his opponent throughout the round while Trinidad continued on the offensive until the fight concluded. The judges gave the champion scores of 117–111, 118–109 and 118–109.|$|E
500|$|Trinidad {{spent the}} next four years {{defending}} his title against numerous fighters in bouts televised on Showtime. Among these fights was a defense against Mahenge Zulu, the number two challenger for Trinidad's championship. [...] This fight was part of a card that took place on April 3, 1998, in Bayamón, Puerto Rico and marked the first time that Trinidad had performed in the island in five years. Trinidad began the first round by cautiously analyzing the challenger's style, but the round ended with quick exchanges after Zulu took the initiative in the offensive. In the second round Zulu was actively pursuing the champion, but retreated when he received a solid jab sequence. Early in the third round a series of jabs opened a wound on Zulu's mouth, while the challenger's punches were not reaching their target. Trinidad began the fourth round heavily on in the offensive connecting several combinations which hurt the challenger, using this to land more punches in Zulu's head and body. One punch hit Zulu in the jaw, he <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and tried to rise, but the referee stopped the fight before he could do so.|$|E
500|$|Bieber {{performed}} [...] "All Around the World" [...] at the Capital FM Summertime Ball 2012. For the performance, he sported fingerless gloves, a Union Jack {{tank with}} matching vest, and jeans. The singer also performed the track during a promotional concert in Europe on June 4, 2012, along with [...] "Boyfriend" [...] and [...] "Die in Your Arms". Bieber also performed [...] "All Around the World" [...] and [...] "Boyfriend" [...] at the 2012 MuchMusic Video Awards on June 17. The song {{is also used}} as Bieber's 2012–13 Believe Tour's opening song. Entering from the upper portion of the arena, Bieber was lowered onto {{the center of the}} stage wearing a massive pair of charcoal-colored wings. He was quickly joined by a troupe of male backing dancers as the song was played. Fireworks exploded, laser lights shot wildly from the ceiling, confetti <b>fell</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> and plumes of smoke were released {{from the bottom of the}} stage. Sophie A. Schillaci from The Hollywood Reporter gave a negative review for the performance and wrote that [...] "if you can move past Justin Bieber’s bizarre stage entrance, flying in on a set of ginormous metal wings to the tune of 'All Around the World', it's hard not to smile at his show".|$|E
