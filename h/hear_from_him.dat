5|$|Meanwhile, Reed, who {{was trying}} to get home, was unable to get State Department {{clearance}} for a visa and was detained in Oslo (then called Christiana), Norway, for more than a month. His letters were censored, and Bryant did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> directly until April. On orders from Edgar Sisson of the U.S. Commission on Public Information, all of Reed's papers were confiscated when he arrived in New York on April 28. Unable to write about the October Revolution without his notes, Reed instead gave speeches advocating U.S. recognition of the new Russian government. That summer, the couple retreated to Croton-on-Hudson.|$|E
5|$|With {{help from}} her friends Bolo and Sky and her {{acquaintance}} Rottytops, she gains access to three dungeons where she retrieves {{three of the}} stones. At the fourth dungeon, Shantae finds the fourth stone, but is ambushed at the exit by Risky, who leaves with the stones. Shantae subsequently discovers the location of Risky's hideout with a magical flying telescope called the sky scope, and teleports there. Shantae reaches and destroys Risky's weapon, the Tinker Tank. Risky tries to kill Shantae but is defeated; and as Risky's hideout collapses, Shantae escapes. After, she is magically abducted to {{a place called the}} Genie Realm where the genies offer her a chance to remain with them as a reward for her courage, but at the price of never seeing her friends again. She refuses and is sent back to Scuttle Town where she announces to Mimic that she had to destroy the steam engine, but is relieved to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> that it was probably for the better.|$|E
25|$|Pélissier called Anquetil, who was {{surprised}} and flattered to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and offered him 30,000 old francs a month to ride for La Perle as an independent, or semi-professional. Anquetil accepted and immediately ordered a new car, a Renault Fregate, which he crashed twice in the first 12 months.|$|E

25|$|King Harkinian announces {{his plan}} to aid Duke Onkled (also voiced by Nelson) of Gamelon (possibly named after Camelot with {{the first and last}} letters changed) when the latter falls under attack by Ganon, and orders Zelda to send Link for backup in case she does not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> within a month. A month passes without word from the King, so Zelda sends Link to find him.|$|E
25|$|For {{the second}} {{consecutive}} year, goaltending was a focus of training camp. After choosing to keep Luongo, the team did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him.</b> He had fired his longtime agent, and hired new representation. This development set off speculation that Luongo would not report to training camp and would try to force a trade. Shortly after the change in representation, his new agents announced that Luongo would attend training camp. In his first interview following the Schneider trade, Luongo stated that he had looked into voiding his contract, but he planned to honor it, and wanted to re-establish himself as an elite goaltender.|$|E
25|$|McPherson {{returned}} to Barrow Shipbuilders {{at the end}} of the season, and played in their 1919–20 FA Cup Preliminary Round defeat to Kells White Star; however, in October 1919, he was signed by Midland League club Chesterfield Municipal, who – either ignoring his cup-tied status or unaware of it entirely – gave him his debut in their FA Cup second qualifying round match against South Normanton Colliery on 25 October; starting at centre-forward, he scored twice as Chesterfield won 5–0. After the match, South Normanton submitted an appeal to The Football Association that McPherson should not have been allowed to play, resulting in Chesterfield being disqualified from the competition and McPherson being banned for a month. Chesterfield manager Tom Callaghan protested that he was unaware that McPherson had already played in the FA Cup that season, but McPherson maintained that he had told his manager he was not available for selection. Callaghan offered McPherson £5 to retract that claim, as well as ordering club captain Peter Irvine to back him up; however, he was found out and sacked from his position, never for the football world to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> again.|$|E
2500|$|The {{well-known}} Austrian pacifist Bertha Von Suttner recalls in her memoires {{the great}} impression of meeting, on that occasion, [...] "the old warrior, General Türr" [...] (he was seventy {{one at the}} time) and <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> that [...] "he had seen so much of war that he came to throughly detest it".|$|R

But I do not ever {{remember}} <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> an ungenerous remark, or seeing <b>him</b> angry apart <b>from</b> minor irritations. His great gift was single-mindedness, and a simplicity that perhaps {{could not see the}} difficulties which a more sophisticated mind might see.' ...|$|R
500|$|Conservative MP {{and animal}} lover Alan Clark was {{suspicious}} {{about the way}} Humphrey's retirement was announced and demanded proof that the cat was still alive: [...] "Humphrey is now a missing person.

500|$|At 4.45, Kerr {{received}} Scholes, {{and informed}} {{him of the}} dissolution. Kerr wrote that [...] "nothing else of relevance" [...] took place between the two men, but by Scholes's account, he accused Kerr of bad faith for making an appointment to receive the Speaker, and then not waiting to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> before dissolving Parliament. Whitlam later stated {{that it would have}} been wiser for Scholes to take the appropriation bills with him, rather than having them sent ahead.|$|E
500|$|Irving {{perfected the}} American short story, {{and was the}} first American writer to place his stories firmly in the United States, even as he poached from German or Dutch folklore. He is also {{generally}} credited {{as one of the first}} to write both in the vernacular, and without an obligation to the moral or didactic in his short stories, writing stories simply to entertain rather than to enlighten. Irving also encouraged would-be writers. As George William Curtis noted, there [...] "is not a young literary aspirant in the country, who, if he ever personally met Irving, did not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> the kindest words of sympathy, regard, and encouragement".|$|E
50|$|Berg's family became {{concerned}} after not <b>hearing</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> for several days. Although a U.S. State Department investigator looked into Berg's disappearance, official government inquiries produced no leads. Berg's family, frustrated {{with what they}} say {{was a lack of}} action by the U.S. government, also hired a private investigator and contacted both their Congressional delegation and the Red Cross in search of information.|$|R

500|$|In February 2010, Shakira {{wrote and}} {{produced}} [...] "Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)" [...] with American record producer John Hill, {{who had previously}} collaborated with her on several songs from She Wolf. The inclusion of Freshlyground, a South African Afro-fusion band, on the track came to take place after Hill met with their producer in New York. The band were finishing their studio album Radio Africa when Hill approached them requesting for input regarding the song. The producer left the band alone to make additions to the track and returned hours later to listen to it. Giving little reaction after hearing it, Hill expressed interest in recording [...] "everything I'd heard here" [...] and told the band that they would <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> later.|$|E
500|$|Ironically, the storyline of {{the film}} was replayed in real life. [...] One of the nonprofessional actresses, a blonde factory worker, had a torrid affair with a {{technician}} who was part {{of the film}} crew. [...] Although the man neglected to tell her that he was married with a child, he promised to send for her when he got back to Prague and set her up in an apartment in the capital city. After waiting {{for a long time to}} <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> and telling all her friends that she would shortly be summoned to her love nest, she packed up her belongings and traveled to Prague, only to be spurned in no uncertain terms. The consequence of this situation was grimmer than the denouement of the film; the girl was embarrassed to return home, became a prostitute, went to jail, attempted suicide and finally emigrated to Australia, where there was a shortage of women, especially among Czech emigres.|$|E
500|$|The book recounts how Erhard's {{childhood}} events, job {{positions and}} self-education {{lead to the}} development of the est training. Born Jack Rosenberg, Erhard was an inquisitive child who was close to his mother. In his student years, he read profusely and earned superior grades. As a teenager, Eerhard experienced both conflicts with his mother and a growing dissatisfaction with his life. Shortly after graduating from high school he married his girlfriend Pat Campbell, who had become pregnant. Instead of pursuing his plans for higher education, he took on a variety of jobs including meat-packing, heating and plumbing, estimating and selling cars. [...] By the age of 21, Erhard had become the top car salesman at the dealership he worked for. By the time he was 25, Erhard and his wife had four children and he was feeling increasingly restless and constrained. He formed a friendship with a woman named June Bryde, which gradually deepened into an affair. He secretly arranged a flight from Philadelphia, Pennsylvania with June in 1960, leaving behind his wife and their four children, who would not <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> for twelve years. The couple settled for a time in St Louis, and it was at this time that he changed his name to Werner Erhard with June changing hers to Ellen Erhard. After more work in car sales, Erhard joined the sales staff of Parents Magazine and was rapidly promoted to training manager and eventually appointed Vice-President in 1967. During this period Erhard moved frequently to different parts of the US as dictated by the demands of the job, finally settling in San Francisco. When Parents Magazine was sold to the Time-Life group, he was recruited by the Grolier Society as Divisional Manager. According to Grolier vice-president John Wirtz the intention of appointing Erhard was that he would bring “integrity, honesty and straightforwardness” to their sales practices.|$|E

2500|$|Young Harris did {{not talk}} about his {{charitable}} contributions {{because he was too}} modest. Even his close friends were not aware of the extent of his generosity. It was said [...] "that little children delighted to crowd around him and <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> the wondrous story of our Lord". The author of Harris' obituary in the Athens Weekly Banner quoted Harris just before he died: [...] "I do not think the deeds of a man are near as important in a religious sense as those things he omits to do; and yet a man ought to feel thankful if it can be said of him after death, 'Here lies a blameless man'." ...|$|E

While Blaylock was living with Earp, she suffered from severe headaches and became addicted to laudanum, an opiate-based pain reliever widely available at the time. After Earp left Tombstone and Blaylock, she waited in Colton, California to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him,</b> but he never contacted her.

2500|$|By 1951, the 64-year-old Frawley had {{appeared}} in over 100 movies, but was starting to find film role offers becoming fewer. When he heard that Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball were casting a new television situation comedy, he applied eagerly {{to play the role}} of the cantankerous, miserly landlord Fred Mertz. [...] One evening he telephoned Lucille Ball, asking her what his chances were. Ball was surprised to <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> — a man she barely knew. Both Ball and Arnaz agreed that it would be great to have Frawley, a motion picture veteran, appear as Fred Mertz. Less enthusiastic were CBS executives, who warned of Frawley's frequent drinking and instability. Arnaz immediately told Frawley about the network's concerns, telling him that if he was late to work, arrived drunk, or was unable to perform because of something other than legitimate illness more than once, he would be written out of the show. Contrary to the network's concerns, Frawley never arrived at work drunk, and in fact mastered his lines after only one reading. Arnaz eventually became one of the misanthropic Frawley's few close friends.|$|E
2500|$|Eugene Aksenoff, a Tokyo-based {{physician}} who had treated Jackson {{and his children}} on a few occasions, expressed concern about Jackson's use of and interest in various drugs. Aksenoff said that Jackson asked for stimulants {{so that he could}} get through some demanding performances. He said he refused to prescribe them. He recalled that the singer suffered chronic fatigue, fever, insomnia and other symptoms and took a large amount of drugs. He suspected one of the major factors causing Jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skin-whitening medications. According to the toxicological tests effectuated on Jackson's body, no addiction had been reported, and none of the experts called to testify at Murray's trial have identified the singer as a drug addict. Janet Jackson confirmed that the Jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007, when Jackson was living in Las Vegas. Janet Jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home, but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to let them in. He was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother. [...] "If you tried to deal with him," [...] one family source said, [...] "he would shut you out. You just wouldn't <b>hear</b> <b>from</b> <b>him</b> for long periods." [...] The family denied that they had tried to intervene.|$|E
