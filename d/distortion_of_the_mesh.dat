40|$|In {{this paper}} we revisit the {{definition}} of the stabilization parameter in the finite element approximation of the convection–diffusion–reaction equation. The starting point is the decomposition of the unknown into its finite element component and a subgrid scale that needs to be approximated. In order to incorporate the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> into this approximation, we transform the equation for the subgrid scale within each element to the shape-regular reference domain. The expression for the subgrid scale arises from an approximate Fourier analysis and the identification of the wave number direction where instabilities are most likely to occur. The final outcome is an expression for the stabilization parameter that accounts for anisotropy and the dominance of either convection or reaction terms in the equation.

The goal is to reproduce the formation of continuous chip in orthogonal machining. The paper tells how metal cutting processes can be modelled with the PFEM and which new tools have been developed to provide the proper capabilities for a successful modelling. The developed method allows for the treatment of large deformations and heat conduction, workpiece-tool contact including friction effects as well as the full thermo-mechanical coupling for contact. The difficulties associated with the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> in areas with high deformation are solved introducing new improvements in the continuous Delaunay triangulation of the particles. The employment of adaptative insertion and removal of particles at every new updated configuration improves the mesh quality allowing for resolution of finer-scale features of the solution. The performance of the method is studied with a set of different two-dimensional tests of orthogonal machining. The examples consider, from the most simple case to the most complex case, different assumptions for the cutting conditions and different material properties.

40|$|The {{arbitrary}} Lagrangian–Eulerian (ALE) {{description in}} non-linear solid mechanics is nowadays stan- dard for hypoelastic–plastic models. An extension to hyperelastic–plastic models is presented here. A fractional-step method—a common choice in ALE analysis—is employed for time-marching: every time-step is split into a Lagrangian phase, {{which accounts for}} material e>ects, and a convection phase, where the relative motion between the material and the ?nite element mesh is considered. In contrast to previous ALE formulations of hyperelasticity or hyperelastoplasticity, the deformed con?guration {{at the beginning of}} the time-step, not the initial undeformed con?guration, is chosen as the reference con?g- uration. As a consequence, convecting variables are required in the description of the elastic response. This is not thecasein previous formulations, whereonly theplastic responsecontains convection terms. In exchange for the extra convective terms, however, the proposed ALE approach has a major advantage: only the quality of the mesh in the spatial domain must be ensured by the ALE remeshing strategy; in previous formulations, it is also necessary to keep the <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> in the material domain under control.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} the morphological effects of acute overdistension {{in the structure}} of the extracellular matrix of the bladder wall in rats. - Materials and Methods: the bladders of a group of 6 male Wistar rats were transurethrally overdistended for 3 hours. Another identical group (the control group) was only submitted to a sham operation. Specimens from the bladder dome were analyzed with light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). - Results: LM - the control group bladders had a 4 to 5 layer urothelium, a lamina propria, and a smooth muscle layer with longitudinal and transversal fibers. the overdistended bladders presented an intense interstitial infiltrate in the lamina propria, and a less intense infiltrate among the smooth muscle fibers. TEM the cells of the overdistended bladders had a significant amount of vacuoles, unlike the control bladders, where such vacuoles were scarce or absent. SEM - A delicate three-dimensional mesh of collagen fibrils was observed in the lamina propria of the bladder walls from the control group. Whilst for the control group this mesh consisted of distinct geometric structures, with mostly circular cellular spaces surrounded by the fibrils, the overdistended group showed evidence of <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh,</b> with flattened and elongated cellular spaces. - Conclusions: Acute bladder overdistension induces structural modifications, altering the arrangement and interaction of collagen fibrils, as well as incipient tissue damage as edema in the lamina propria and smooth muscle layers.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the design of}} a computational Fluid-Structure Interaction algorithm for the analysis of unsteady flow of an incompressible fluid around a flexible structural membrane. An example of such a system is the interaction of a lightweight fabric building structure with the surrounding wind. These structures are highly flexible and have the potential to display aeroelastic instabilities and undergo deformations which are large compared to the membrane thickness. A numerical computational method capable of investigating this complex behaviour is developed in this work. A boundary fitted unstructured triangular fluid mesh is used; the fully viscous Navier-Stokes equations are discretised on the moving mesh using a collocated Finite Volume method, 'with the SIMPLE algorithm for pressure solution. Mesh non-orthogonalities and geometric conservation are appropriately addressed. A dynamic structure approach is taken, tracking the unsteady membrane motions over time and using nodal velocities as the degrees of freedom. A new distributed elasticity model is implemented for the calculation of internal forces to improve stability. The motion of internal fluid mesh nodes is determined following a pseudo-structural approach, taking into account elastic spring forces in the mesh edges and nodal forces due to <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> elements driven by the displacements of the fluidstructure boundary. The method is shown to be applicable to simulations on moving meshes, and successfully predicts formation and separation of fluid boundary layers from the structure surface. Two coupled unsteady fluid-membrane structure interaction investigations are carried out; flow over an elastic membrane pinned at both ends and flow over an elastic membrane with one free end. The results highlight significant unsteady interactions between the membrane and the flow, which it is only possible to model with a coupled aeroelastic approach. Suggestions for further work, including the simple extension of the method to three dimensions, are described. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

The perturbation, which consists initially of mesh displacements in the capsule, is represented by the sum of many spherical harmonic modes, having finite amplitudes and realistic spectrum. A 90 -degree sector of the capsule is modeled, allowing proper boundary conditions for all modes simultaneously. Because of the large <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> that occurs during the calculations, it is necessary to rezone the mesh frequently, by mapping physical variables to a new undistorted mesh. No model-specific parameters are required in this technique. The authors have used the technique to calculate the yield of several designs for a National Ignition Facility capsule as a function of initial root-mean-square surface roughness {sigma} of the outer ablator surface or the inner cryogenic DT surface. Typically for a capsule they find a ``cliff`` at a critical value of {sigma} = {sigma}{sub crit} such that the yield of the capsule decreases abruptly for {sigma} > {sigma}{sub crit}, indicating a failure to ignite. The values of {sigma}{sub crit} they compute are probably upper limits {{because of the lack of}} 3 D effects, and inaccuracies in Lagrangian modeling of such unstable flows. It is expected that more accurate modeling, perhaps with 3 D Eulerian codes, will lead to smaller values for {sigma}{sub crit}. They are beginning to carry out studies of the coupling of low-mode radiation flux asymmetries to higher-mode surface perturbations.

40|$|Zoning of {{avalanche}} risk {{areas is}} one important task of land-use planning in alpine areas. The lack of records, {{due to the}} low frequency of these events, makes it dicult to implement a statistical analysis. Simulations made with physical and mathematical models can improve {{the knowledge of the}} dynamics of these events. In this thesis three didifferent mathematical and numerical models, based on the rheological theory of Savage and Hutter for granular flows, are introduced. A one dimensional model with variable width, written in a curvilinear coordinate system, has been developed. New rheological hypotheses have been introduced in order to describe the frictional interaction with vertical sides. The model has been tested against experimental data, relevant to cases with constant width, collected in the literature. The results give a first confirmation of the rheology, but a campaign of laboratory experiments is necessary in order to verify the model in cases with variable width. The two-dimensional model, implemented at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, has been developed. It was originally written in an horizontal coordinate system, assuming a linear stress tensor distribution and the constancy of the velocity along the vertical instead of along the normal to the bottom direction. The model has been improved by defining a rotated absolute coordinate system, which best fits the sliding surface. This modification corrected the initial delay shown in the simulations of the original model, with respect to the experimental data reported by Gray et al. (1993) in literature. An experimental campaign has been carried out in order to calibrate the two-dimensional model. A two-axial moving system, carrying a laser distance sensor, has been added to the double slope chute of the Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Trento, in order to automatically scan the final deposits. Alternative choices {{of the structure of the}} stress tensor have been tested against experimental data. The two-dimensional model cannot still be applied to real cases. The severe <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh,</b> due to strong planimetric gradients of velocity, causes the crash of the model in presence of complex topographies. We focused our attention on meshless methods in order to solve this type of problems. In meshless methods, the computational nodes, which discretize the fluid domain, are not bound by topological relations, as in finite difference and nite element methods. This make them suitable to problems characterized by mass separations, strong deformations and discontinuities. The Moving Least Square Particle Hydrodynamics (MLSPH) method, created by Dilts (1999, 2000), has been applied to the one-dimensional model developed at the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering of Trento. In the MLPSH model the equations of motion are written in weak form and the field variables of the problem are approximated by means of the Moving Least Square Approximants (MLSA) (Lancaster and Salkauskas (19)). The one-dimensional MLSPH model showed a strong increase of the computational time with respect to its original version, not compensated by a significant improve of performances. Nevertheless, the extension to the two-dimensional case, where more strict constraints are imposed by the mesh, looks promising. The avalanche site of Lavina Granda, in Vigolana range, has been equipped in order to measure the dynamic parameters of real avalanches. We set up three sections for velocity measurements, one section for flowing depth measurement, two graduated poles to estimate snow cover depth in the initiation zone. Wooden tracers were spread over the catchment in order to evaluate avalanche activity. During the winter season 2002 - 2003 no avalanche activity affected the channel. On summer 2003 a debris flow ran down along the channel. Its flowing velocity was measured and its paths were identified by means of the wooden tracers. During the winter 2003 - 2004 three granular avalanches and one powder avalanche took place in the channel.

40|$|Producer gas {{derived from}} biomass {{is one of}} the most {{environment}} friendly substitutes to the fossil fuels. Usage of producer gas for power generation has effect of zero net addition of CO 2 in atmosphere. The engines working on producer gas have potential to decrease the dependence on conventional fuels for power generation. However, the combustion process is governed by complex interactions between chemistry and fluid dynamics, some of which are not completely understood. Improved knowledge of combustion is, therefore, of vital importance for both direct use in the design of engines, and for the evolution of reliable simulation tools for engine development. The present work is related to the turbulent combustion of producer gas in closed vessels and engine cylinders. The main objective of the work was multi-dimensional simulation of turbulent combustion in the bowl-in-piston engine operating on producer gas fuel and to observe the flame and flow field interaction. First, the combustion model was validated in constant volume combustion chamber with experimental results. Experimental turbulent combustion data of producer gas (composition matching with engine operating conditions) was presented. The required data of laminar burning velocity of producer gas was computed and used in the simulation of turbulent combustion in closed vessel. The effect of squish and reverse squish flow on flame propagation in the bowl-in-piston engine cylinder was described. Laminar burning velocity of unstretched flame was computed using flame code which was developed earlier in this laboratory. One dimensional computations of unstretched planar flame were made to calculate laminar burning velocity of the producer gas-air mixture at pressures (1 - 10 bar) and temperatures (300 - 600 K). A correlation of laminar burning velocity of producer gas as a function of pressure and temperature was fitted and compared with experiments. A fixed composition and equivalence ratio of producer gas-air mixture, typical of the engine operating conditions, was considered. The correlation was used in simulation of turbulent combustion in closed vessel. The turbulent combustion experiments with producer gas-air mixture were conducted in a closed vessel. The aim of experiments was to generate pressure-time data, in closed vessel during turbulent flame propagation, which was required to validate turbulent combustion models. Determination of (ST /SL) was made from pressure-time data which requires corresponding laminar combustion data with same initial conditions. For this purpose a set of laminar combustion experiments was conducted. Experimental setup consists of a constant volume combustion chamber of cubical shape and size 80 x 80 x 80 mm 3. The initial mixtures pressure and temperature were 1 bar and 300 K respectively. A fixed composition and equivalence ratio of producer gas-air mixture, typical of the engine operating conditions, was used. The composition of producer gas was H 2 - 19. 61 %, CO 2 - 19. 68 %, CH 4 - 2. 52 %, CO 2 - 12. 55 % and N 2 - 45. 64 % on volume basis. Fuel-air mixture was ignited with electric spark at the center of the cube. Initial turbulence in the chamber was created by moving a perforated plate with specified velocity. Perforated plate was placed in chamber so that the central hole in the plate passes over the spark electrodes as it sweeps across the chamber. Two geometrically similar plates with hole diameter of 5 and 10 mm were used. The new experimental setup constructed as a part of this work was first tested with one set of experiments each with methane and propane data of SL and ST /SL from the literature. Maximum turbulent intensity (u’) achieved was 1. 092 ms− 1. The ratios of turbulent to laminar burning velocity (ST /SL) values were determined at six different turbulence intensity levels. Laminar combustion experiments were extended to elevated initial pressures 2 - 5 bar and temperature 300 K. The value of SL was calculated from the pressure-time history recorded during laminar stretching flame propagation inside closed vessel. These SL values were compared with computed SL,∞ after accounting for stretch. Turbulent combustion simulations were carried out to validate combustion models suitable for multi-dimensional CFD simulation of combustion in constant volume closed chamber. Two models proposed by Choi and Huh, based on Flame Surface Density (FSD) were tested with the present experimental results. User FORTRAN code for the source terms in transport equation of FSD was implemented in ANSYS-CFX 10. 0 software. First model called CFM 1, grossly under-predicted the rate of combustion. The second model called CFM 2, predicted the results satisfactorily after replacing the arbitrary length scale with turbulent integral length scale (lt) having a limiting value near the wall. The modified CFM 2 model was able to predict the propagation phase of the developed flame satisfactorily, though the duration for initial flame development was over-predicted by the model. CFD simulation of producer gas engine combustion process was carried out using ANSYSCFX software. Mesh deformation option was used to take care of moving boundaries such as piston and valve surfaces. The fluid domain expands during suction process and contracts during compression process. In order to avoid excessive <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> elements, a series of meshes at different crank angle positions were generated and checked for their quality during mesh motion in the solver. For suction process simulation, unstructured meshes having 0. 1 to 0. 3 million cells were used. During the compression and combustion process simulations, structured meshes having 40, 000 to 0. 1 million cells were used. k-ε model was used for turbulence simulation. The suction, compression and combustion processes of an SI engine were simulated. Initial flame kernel was given by providing high flame surface density in a small volume comparable to the spark size at the time of ignition. The flame surface density model, CFM- 2, was adapted with the modification of length scale tested against constant volume experiments. A suitable limiting value was used to avoid abnormal flame propagation near the wall. The limiting value of integral length scale (lt) near the wall was determined by linear extrapolation of the integral length scale in the domain to the wall. Engine p - θ curves of three different ignition timings 26 °, 12 ° and 6 °before top dead center (TDC) were simulated and compared with earlier experimental results. The effects of flow field on flame propagation have been observed. A comparison of the simulated and experimental p - θ diagram of the engine for all above cases gave mixed results. For the ignition timing at 26 ° before TDC case, predicted peak pressure value was 17 % higher and at 3 ° earlier than those of the experimental peak. For the other two cases, the predicted peak pressure value was 28 % lower and 5 ° later than those of the experimental peak. The reason for under-prediction of the pressure values could be due to the delay in development of initial flame kernel. Simulated pressure curves have offset about 3 - 4 ° compared to the experimental pressure curves. It was observed that in all predicted p - θ cases, there was a delay in the initial flame development. It is evident from the under-prediction of pressure values, especially in the initial flame kernel development phase and it also affects the p - θ curve at later stage. The delay was about 3 - 4 ° of crank angle rotation in various cases. The delay in predicting the initial flame development needs to be corrected in order to predict the combustion process properly. The proposed FSD model seems to have capability to predict p - θ values fairly in the propagation phase of developed flame. Reasonably good match was obtained by advancing the ignition timing in the computation by about 3 - 4 ° compared to the experimental setting. In the bowl-in-piston engine cylinders, the flow in the cylinder is characterised by squish and reverse squish when the piston is moving towards and away from the top dead center (TDC) respectively. The effect of squish and reverse squish flow on flame propagation has been assessed. For the more advanced ignition case, i. e., 26 ° before TDC, The flame propagation did not have favorable effect by the flow field. The direction of flame propagation was against the squish and reverse squish flow. This resulted in suppressed peak velocities in the cylinder compared the motoring process. Hence the burning rate was not augmented by the turbulence inside the cylinder. For the ignition 12 ° before TDC case, the flame propagation did have favorable effect by the flow field. During the reverse squish period, the flame had reached the bowl wall. At this stage, the flame was pushing the reactants out and this augments the reverse-squish flow, and hence the maximum reverse-squish velocity was increased to 2. 03 times the peak reverse-squish velocity of motoring case. The reverse-squish flow was distorting the flame from spherical shape and the flame gets stretched. Flame surface enters the cylindrical region faster compared to the previous case. The stretched flame in the reverse-squish flow may be considered as reverse squish flame, as was proposed earlier by Sridhar G. The burn rate during the reverse squish period may be 2 to 2. 5 times the normal burn rate. For the ignition 6 ° before TDC case, the flame was very small in size and it did not affect the flow in squish period. During the reverse squish period, the flame radius was moderate compared to the bowl radius. The flame was pushing the reactants out and it increased the maximum reverse-squish velocity to 1. 3 times by the flame. In this case, the reverse-squish flow moderately affecting the flame shapes. The results of this study could give an idea of what ignition timing must be kept for favorable use of flow field inside the engine cylinder. Main contributions from the present work are: Multi-dimensional simulation of combustion process inside the engine cylinder operating on producer gas was carried out to examine flame/flow field interactions. Two models based on FSD were first tested against present experimental results in constant volume combustion chamber. In CFM 2 model; a modification of replacing the arbitrary length scale by integral length scale with a limiting value near the wall was suggested to avoid prediction of abnormally large turbulent burning velocity near the wall. This combustion model has been implemented in ANSYS-CFX 10. The required data of laminar and turbulent burning velocities of producer gas-air mixture has been determined by experiments and computations at varied initial pressures and turbulent intensities. Finally, the simulated engine pressure data has been compared with earlier experimental data of the engine operating on producer gas. The proposed FSD model has the capability to match well with the experimental results except for the initial flame kernel development phase. Even though this issue needs to be resolved, the work has brought out the important interaction between the flame propagation and flow field within the bowl-in-piston engine cylinder...|$|E

Two major anomalies with different frequency levels were identified after chronic exposure to 0. 37, 1. 2, 11. 6, 21. 4 and 43. 3 μg l− 1 <b>of</b> Cd. <b>The</b> first was a <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> midline <b>meshes</b> where <b>the</b> diamond-shape structure is disrupted and <b>the</b> <b>meshes</b> are separated by extra strands (called ‘midline’ anomaly). The second aberration consisted <b>of</b> a <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rectilinear structure <b>of</b> net opening by strands being fused or added over <b>the</b> <b>meshes</b> (called ‘crossover’ anomaly). The midline distortion may be linked to a physiological stress caused by Cd, which can affect <b>the</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> net-spinning process. It was not possible to relate the crossover aberrations to a specific toxic action of Cd, but data indicated that both anomalies are independent from each other and that two modes of action could be implicated. Protein analyses of capture nets have revealed silk polypeptide modifications at the highest Cd concentration tested, indicating a possible effect of Cd interaction with silk proteins. However, neither a gradient-concentration nor a time-dependent response could be established with both aberration frequencies. Silk protein modifications would rather play a secondary role in <b>the</b> appearance <b>of</b> both net anomalies, and mostly at a high concentration level. Finally, the toxicity curves (EC 50) show that the sensitivity threshold for both types of aberration ranged from 1 to 5 μg l− 1 which is highly sensitive compared with other sublethal effects of Cd on other macroinvertebrate species. Hence, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> capture-net anomalies of hydropsychid larvae would represent a valuable indicator of sublethal toxicity induced by Cd and possibly by other metals in running waters...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{conventional}} deformation analysis <b>of</b> geomaterials, <b>the</b> infinitesimal and {{the finite}} deformation theories {{have been widely}} used. These theories have been successfully implemented in several numerical methods, such as finite element method (FEM). As a result, {{it is now possible}} to predict a wide variety of deformation behaviors of geomaterials. However, when dealing with large deformation problems using <b>the</b> framework <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FEM, excess <b>distortion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FEM <b>mesh</b> may lead to instability <b>of</b> <b>the</b> calculation. In this study, in order to solve large deformation problem <b>of</b> geomaterials, <b>the</b> smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) method is used. The method is a kind of particle method based on the mesh-free Lagrangian scheme, and is one <b>of</b> <b>the</b> promising numerical methods in <b>the</b> field <b>of</b> geotechnical engineering. <b>The</b> method can solve large deformation problems without mesh distortion. Moreover, it can handle the governing equations and existing constitutive models for geomaterials based on a continuum mechanics. Therefore, this method can represent the entire deformation process of a geomaterial from the small strain region to the large deformation region. In this paper, first, basic theory and formulation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPH method based on solid mechanics are summarized. Then, <b>the</b> result <b>of</b> a simple calculation is shown to verify <b>the</b> accuracy <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spatial derivatives based on <b>the</b> theory <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SPH method. Also, simulations of simple shear tests of both an elastic and elasto-plastic material are carried out and the obtained results are compared with theoretical solutions.

The numerical results obtained from the SPH method and the safety factors obtained from the Fellenius method are compared. The results indicated that the SPH method is able to express <b>the</b> same tendencies <b>of</b> safety factor obtained from the conventional circular slippage calculations.

30|$|The here {{presented}} approach {{falls into}} <b>the</b> class <b>of</b> finite element methods with immersed boundaries and the spatial discretisation does not conform with <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> solid-fluid interface. Henceforth, {{we refer to}} our method as an immersed finite element method even though the term has already been employed in [29] (see also, [35]) for a finite element analogy to the immersed boundary method of [27], which basically consists of an explicit coupling scheme where structural forces are imposed on <b>the</b> fluid <b>mesh</b> and <b>the</b> computed velocities modify the structural configuration. The method presented in [33] and typically the immersed boundary method do not sharply resolve the interface but work with a transition zone between the two media {{that depends on the}} grid resolution. The method proposed here works with a so-called sharp interface representation [19] and is based on the immersed b-spline finite element method proposed in [36]; see also [37, 38] for finite element methods with embedded interfaces. Therein, the application to viscous fluid flow with moving boundaries has been targeted and later carried over to <b>the</b> partitioned analysis <b>of</b> fluid-structure interaction in [8]. In this latter reference, the structure is resolved by a Lagrangian <b>mesh</b> and <b>the</b> fluid with a Eulerian mesh in which an implicit geometry representation is superimposed in order to capture the interface. Here, this idea is pushed further by using only one analysis mesh for both solid and fluid, in <b>the</b> spirit <b>of</b> <b>the</b> methods developed in [39, 40], which are based on a fully Eulerian description, see also [41 – 43]. <b>The</b> drawback <b>of</b> fully Eulerian approaches for the solid is that displacement and velocity become independent fields that are coupled by an additional advection equation which needs to be solved [42]. In order to avoid this additional equation and have solid velocities as an extra field, we choose an Updated Lagrangian method [44] combined with particle tracking, as advertised in [45] for plasticity problems with large deformations. Moreover, this choice <b>of</b> expressing <b>the</b> solid equilibrium in the latest known configuration avoids <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> shape derivatives [46] in the linearisation process for the used Newton method. Under <b>the</b> assumption <b>of</b> small velocities, <b>the</b> time derivatives are completely neglected from the field equations and only appear through the interface condition between solid and fluid. This condition is weakly incorporated using Nitsche’s method [47], see also [8, 46] for this technique in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> an iterative coupling method. A signed distance function is used to capture <b>the</b> location <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interface as a level set [48] for the field computation. At <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> every time step an explicit surface parameterisation is generated and moved with the computed displacement increment. Note that we combine explicit and implicit geometry descriptions; the implicit version is used for a quick interface detection at <b>the</b> beginning <b>of</b> each simulation step. Falling back to a temporary explicit description allows to accurately trace the interface location without <b>the</b> need <b>of</b> additional advection equations as common in level set methods [48]. We thereby avoid possible <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> surface <b>mesh</b> when using an entirely explicit surface description.|$|R

These methods are not convenient for any improvement <b>of</b> <b>the</b> basis vectors when new data are added into the data base. We consider the data as a state evolution and we propose an incremental algorithm to build basis functions for <b>the</b> decomposition <b>of</b> this state evolution. The proposed algorithm is based on the APHR method (A Priori Hyper-Reduction method). This is an adaptive strategy to build reduced order model when the state evolution is implicitely defined by non-linear governing equations. In case of known state evolutions the APHR method is an incremental KarhunenLò eve decomposition. This approach is very convenient to expand the subspace spanned by the basis functions. In <b>the</b> first part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> present paper the main concepts related to the " a priori " model reduction technique are revisited, as a previous task to its application in the cases considered in the next sections. Some engineering problems are defined in domains that evolve in time. When this evolution is large the present and the reference configurations differ significantly. Thus, when the problem is formulated in the total Lagrangian framework frequent remeshing is required to avoid too large <b>distortions</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite element <b>mesh.</b> Other possibility for describing these models lies in <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> an updated formulation in which <b>the</b> <b>mesh</b> is conformed to each intermediate configuration. When the finite element method is used, then frequent remeshing must be carried out to perform an optimal meshing at each intermediate configuration. However, when the natural element method, a novel meshless technique, is considered, whose accuracy does not depend significantly on <b>the</b> relative position <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes, then large simulations can be performed without any remeshing stage, being the nodal position at each intermediate configuration defined by <b>the</b> transport <b>of</b> <b>the</b> nodes by the material velocity or the advection terms.
