5|$|Care must {{be taken}} with medications, as side effects may be more common and harder to {{evaluate}} in individuals with AS, and tests of drugs' effectiveness against comorbid conditions routinely exclude individuals from the autism spectrum. Abnormalities in metabolism, cardiac conduction times, and {{an increased risk of}} type 2 diabetes have been raised as concerns with these medications, along with serious long-term neurological side effects. SSRIs can lead to manifestations of behavioral activation such as increased impulsivity, aggression, and sleep disturbance. Weight gain and fatigue are commonly reported side effects of risperidone, which may also lead to increased risk for extrapyramidal symptoms such as restlessness and dystonia and increased serum prolactin levels. Sedation and weight gain are more common with olanzapine, which has also been linked with diabetes. Sedative side-effects in school-age children have ramifications <b>for</b> <b>classroom</b> learning. Individuals with AS may be unable to identify and communicate their internal moods and emotions or to tolerate side effects that for most people would not be problematic.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, {{the middle}} {{hall of the}} high school was competed, and in the {{following}} year, the north hall {{of the high school}} was also constructed.

40|$|Air {{distribution}} solutions <b>for</b> <b>classrooms</b> {{aiming to}} lower air velocities and good temperature control are studied by measurements in 6 schools and temperature simulations. Air velocity measurements showed good performance of duct and ceiling diffusers which provided maximum velocities less than 0. 2 m/s {{and can be}} highly recommended <b>for</b> <b>classrooms.</b> The wall diffusers were clearly not suitable <b>for</b> <b>classrooms</b> due to high velocities up to 0. 43 m/s. Displacement ventilation diffusers were very sensitive to supply air temperature, as with the temperature difference of 3 °C velocities up to 0. 28 m/s were measured. Room temperature measurement results showed a typical problem with temperature control as {{at the end of}} the heating season the temperatures up to 25 °C were measured. The parametric simulations showed that high supply air flow rates up to 10 L/s per person and cool supply air down to 14 – 15 °C were needed for room temperature control...|$|R
