This study aimed to detect and genotype E. bieneusi in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected persons. Stool specimens were collected from 463 HIV-infected patients and analyzed for E. bieneusi by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequence analysis of the internal transcribed spacer. E. bieneusi was detected in 77 HIV patients. CD 4 cell counts < 200 cells/µL was associated with E. bieneusi infection (P = 0. 09). E. bieneusi {{was significantly associated with}} weight loss (P < 0. 0001), diarrhea (P = 0. 006), fever (P < 0. 0001), not being married (P < 0. 0001), and <b>flush</b> <b>type</b> of toilet (P = 0. 0007).

40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation of}} the flow within a generic <b>flush</b> <b>type</b> water-jet inlet {{has been carried out}} to identify the principal flow features and provide a basis for devel-opment of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) models. Tests were performed in a cavitation tunnel with the model inlet fitted to the test section ceiling, and effects of thickening the ingested tunnel wall boundary layer were investigated. The model was fitted with a range of instrumentation to investigate the ramp pressure distribution and boundary layer development, lip incidence, and pump face flow properties. Obser-vations of lip and duct cavitation inception and behavior were also made. The results showed the inlet performance to be generally improved with the ingestion of a thicker boundary layer. The thickened boundary layer significantly reduced ramp boundary layer separation and distortion of flow at the notional pump face. However, a greater range of lip incidence occurred with the thickened boundary layer with consequent greater likelihood of lip separation and cavitation occurrence. Ideal lip incidence and pump face flow uniformity occurred at flow parameters significantly different from those for ideal pump face pressure recovery. Large developed cavities on the inlet lip were observed for a range of conditions typical of conventional high-speed vessel operation. 1...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} {{optimization}} of Electrical Discharge Machining (EDM) Injection <b>flushing</b> <b>type</b> control parameters on multi-performance optimization characteristics instead of single performance optimization using Grey Relational Analysis (GRA) Method. The experimental control parameters were being optimized {{according to their}} various machining characteristics namely material removal rate (MRR), electrode wear ratio (EWR) and surface roughness (SR) using copper as the tool and AISI 304 stainless steel as the workpiece. This parameters optimization was based on Taguchi’s orthogonal array (OA) combined with GRA. A grey relational grade (GRG) calculated based on GRA was used to optimize the EDM process with multiple performance characteristics and Taguchi’s L 18 OA was used to plan the experiments. The machining parameters selected are polarity, pulse on duration, discharge current, discharge voltage, machining depth, machining diameter and dielectric liquid pressure. Results shown that machining performance was improved effectively using this approach.

40|$|The project {{described}} in this thesis was undertaken m order to gam {{a better understanding of}} hull-waterjet interaction. The study has investigated interaction effects between a waterjet featuring a <b>flush</b> <b>type</b> intake and a planing hull, 7. 4 metres in length. Full and model scale resistance and propulsion tests have been conducted to accurately measure the thrust deduction fraction and interaction forces. Various techniques for measuring the waterjet thrust are discussed. Graphs of the thrust deduction fraction for a variety of towing positions are reported. Hull static pressure measurements are also reported. A free body, vector approach was used to develop empirical, analytical models for both the towing and propulsion situations. Both models are based on the Savitsky planing performance equations. The propulsion model draws also on Hadler's work on propeller-hull interaction. The analytical towing model was validated against full scale towing tests and small correction functions added. The adjusted model was found to compare favourably with model tests. Using the correction factors developed for the towing model, an analytical propulsion model is constructed incorporating the waterjet momentum forces. A method is described whereby a vector, called the interaction vector, accounting for remaining interaction effects can be found. Two mechanisms are proposed which would account for the interaction vector. By comparing the full scale propulsion tests with the propulsion model, the interaction vector is found. Its general magnitude and position are shown to be consistent with the combined proposed mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study between a computation and an experiment {{has been conducted}} to predict {{the performance of a}} Pod type waterjet for an amphibious wheeled vehicle. The Pod type waterjet has been chosen {{on the basis of the}} required specific speed of more than 2500. As the Pod type waterjet is an extreme type of axial flow type waterjet, theoretical as well as experimental works about Pod type waterjets are very rare. The main purpose of the present study is to validate and compare to the experimental results of the Pod type waterjet with the developed CFD in-house code based on the RANS equations. The developed code has been validated by comparing with the experimental results of the well-known turbine problem. The validation also extended to the <b>flush</b> <b>type</b> waterjet where the pressures along the duct surface and also velocities at nozzle area have been compared with experimental results. The Pod type waterjet has been designed and the performance of the designed waterjet system including duct, impeller and stator was analyzed by the previously mentioned in-house CFD Code. The pressure distributions and limiting streamlines on the blade surfaces were computed to confirm the performance of the designed waterjets. In addition, the torque and momentum were computed to find the entire efficiency and these were compared with the model test results. Measurements were taken of the flow rate at the nozzle exit, static pressure at the various sections along the duct and also the nozzle, revolution of the impeller, torque, thrust and towing forces at various advance speeds for the prediction of performance as well as for comparison with the computations. Based on these measurements, the performance was analyzed according to the ITTC 96 standard analysis method. The full-scale effective and the delivered power of the wheeled vehicle were estimated for the prediction of the service speed. This paper emphasizes the confirmation of the ITTC 96 analysis method and the developed analysis code for the design and analysis of the Pod type waterjet system...|$|E

40|$|Carbon {{nanotubes}} {{have become}} one of the most important building blocks critical to nanotechnology. Carbon nanotubes have attracted the interests of many scientists since their discovery due to their remarkable properties and have been widely used for various applications. However, the bottle neck in nanotube research has been the lack of a cheap, continuous and fast nanotube production method. This study concerns a reactor where nanotubes are continuously deposited on a carbon substrate using arc discharge at atmospheric pressure. This process appears to be the first to employ an arc discharge as the method for continuous mass deposition of nanotubes on a substrate. This nanotube deposition method eliminates the generic multistep process of nanotube deposition on substrates for its use in many applications. The effect of various parameters influencing growth and morphology of nanotubes on the substrate in the arc reactor (inter-electrode gap, atmosphere composition, current density, <b>flushing,</b> substrate <b>type</b> and speed and catalyst) have been systematically explored to optimise nanotube growth. The field emission properties of the nanotube laden substrate are studied for use and applicability as electron emitters. The nanotube samples demonstrated superior emission properties, low turn-on field and excellent current stability when put into applications such as a luminescent tube and an ionisation sensor. Theoretical modelling of the behaviour of a single nanotube during field emission was performed using finite element analysis software (COMSOL 3. 2) to understand the effect of nanotube length, diameter, and vacuum gap on an individual nanotube. The results reveal that resistive heating (temperature) limits the maximum current carried by an individual nanotube. Furthermore, a new growth model is introduced to explain the formation of nanotubes from graphene fragments and nanocrystallites, due to polarisation of carbon species near the electrode surface suggesting that carbon vapour is unlikely to be responsible for nanotube growth...|$|R
40|$|Embryo {{transfer}} (ET) is a biotechnology {{that allows}} {{to get more}} than one foal from a single mare during a breading season and also to prevent the removal of mares from their competition careers. Nevertheless, to achieve a successful outcome, the association of many factors must be considered such as the management of donor and recipient mares, the stallions and the veterinarian´s experience. The aims {{of this study were}} to evaluate (1) if some of characteristics related to the donor mares such as the breed and the reproductive status, may influence the embryo recovery; (2) if climate and different donor mares location may have impact in breeding programs; (3) the effect of some reproductive techniques and embryo transfer methodologies such as the day of uterine <b>flushing,</b> the <b>type</b> of semen, the stallion and the moment of inseminations and transfer as potential effectors of success. To achieve the objectives pointed out, one hundred and fifty six uterine flushes and eighty eight embryo transfers were performed. Obtained results showed higher embryo recovery rates at day 8 (61. 1 %) and an overall pregnancy rate of 62. 2 %. An influence of the month of the year (P= 0. 04) and of the type of semen (fresh or frozen; P= 0. 03) on the number of positive embryo collections were identified. No other significant effects upon the remaining determinants under testing were observed, although stallions were responsible for inducing 11 % of the variability within embryo recovery rates. In conclusion, the main factors that had a great influence in this embryo transfer program were the type of semen and the day and month of the uterine flushing procedure. The use of fresh semen for donor mares insemination and recovery at day 8 increased the number of embryos that were collected during this period, although lower results were obtained in July-August. These procedures should be consider and implement in mare embryo transfer centres...|$|R

40|$|A {{modelling}} methodology using a leachate {{source term}} has been produced for estimating the timescales for achieving environmental equilibrium status for landfilled waste. Results are reported as {{the period of}} active management required for modelled scenarios of non-flushed and flushed sites {{for a range of}} pre-filling treatments. The base scenario against which results were evaluated was raw municipal solid waste (MSW) for which only cadmium failed to reach equilibrium. Flushed raw MSW met our criteria for stabilisation with active leachate management for 40 years, subject to each of the leachate species being present at or below their average UK concentrations. Stable non-reactive wastes, meeting EU waste acceptance criteria, fared badly in the non-flushed scenario, with only two species stabilising after a management period within 1000 years and the majority requiring > 2000 years of active leachate management. The flushing scenarios showed only a marginal improvement, with arsenic still persisting beyond 2000 years management even with an additional 500 mm y− 1 of infiltration. The stabilisation time for mechanically sorted organic residues (without flushing) was high, and even with flushing, arsenic and chromium appeared to remain a problem. Two mechanical biological treatment (MBT) scenarios were examined, with medium and high intensity composting. Both were subjected to the non-flushing and flushing scenarios. The non-flushing case of both options fell short of the basic requirements of achieving equilibrium within decades. The intense composting option with minimal flushing appeared to create a scenario where equilibrium could be achieved. For incinerator bottom ash (raw and subjected to various treatments), antimony, copper, chloride and sulphate were the main controls on achieving equilibrium, irrespective of treatment <b>type.</b> <b>Flushing</b> at higher flushing rates (500 mm y− 1) failed to demonstrate a significant reduction in the management period requ...|$|R
40|$|The {{experience}} of developing unmanned fighting vehicles {{indicates that the}} main challenge in this field reduces itself to creating the systems which can replace the pilot both as a sensor and as the operator of the flight. This problem can be partial- ly solved by introducing remote control, {{but there are certain}} flight segments where it can only be executed under fully inde- pendent control and data support due to various reasons, such as tight time, short duration, lack of robust communication, etc. Such stages also include close-range air combat maneuvering (CRACM) - a key flight segment as far as the fighter's purpose is concerned, which also places the highest demands on the fighter's design. Until recently the creation of an unmanned fighter airplane has been a fundamentally impossible task due to the absence of sensors able to provide the necessary data support to control the fighter during CRACM. However, the development prospects of aircraft hardware (passive <b>type</b> <b>flush</b> antennae, op- tico-locating panoramic view stations) are indicative of producing possible solutions to this problem in the nearest future.

40|$|The WADES {{project is}} {{assessing}} {{the impact of}} climate change on ecological services of moorlands, such as plant biodiversity and flood and drought regulation. o achieve this by producing a hydrological model based on the functional soil classes of the Nant-y-Brwyn catchment, North Wales. Using hypotheses suggesting how climate change may alter these soil classes, it is then possible to model the hydrological implications. 	This report describes the collating of data that the hydrological model will require to run. The structure of the PDM model chosen to model the catchment area was analysed, and soil moisture capacity and field capacity were identified as key parameters. Potentially useful field measurements were identified, including taking soil core samples to calculate soil moisture capacities and the polythene sheet method for field capacity measurement. Fieldwork to obtain soil cores from four functional soil classes (deep peat with true blanket bog vegetation; organomineral soils with 10 - 40 cm or < 10 cm organic layers; and flushed soils dominated by groundwater efflux) was undertaken in the Nant-y-Brwyn catchment. Soil cores were then analysed in the laboratory. Soils were dried to water potentials near (above and below) the Wilting Point (– 1. 5 MPa), and measurements of actual water potential in the sample were taken using a WP 4 Dewpoint PotentiaMeter machine. The samples were then weighed, dried and reweighed to calculate soil moisture content. A linear regression was fitted to the water potential vs. water content plot for each soil core, and {{used to calculate the}} expected water content at wilting point. 	Results showed an as-expected general trend of higher soil moisture contents for less negative water potentials. This was less conclusive amongst the Flush soils however, where significant scatter was observed, along with the largest range of average soil moisture contents of all soil classes. Measurement errors are possible, but the <b>Flush</b> soil <b>type</b> was relatively heterogeneous and so uncertainty in the measurement is unsurprising. Bog soils had the smallest range of average soil moisture contents (0. 08 g H 2 O g- 1 dried soil), indicating more homogenous soil characteristics, despite having the greatest average soil moisture at wilting point, 0. 98 g H 2 O g- 1 dried soil. Wet and dry soil classes were found to have smaller but similar average soil moisture values at wilting point, at 0. 91 and 0. 94 g H 2 O g- 1 dried soil, respectively. 	Proposals have been made as to how the hydrological soil characteristics discovered would be represented in the PDM model, with focus on the proportional distribution of the soil classes in the catchment being incorporated into the PDM’s Pareto distribution parameter. ...|$|R

Included are the results of chemical plug bench testing conducted in support of the M 1 /M 6 Flow Loop Chemical Plugging/Unplugging Test (TP-RPP-WTP- 495 Rev A). These results support the proposed plug simulants for the chemical plugging/ unplugging tests. Based on the available simulant data, a set of simulants was identified that would likely result in chemical plugs. The three types of chemical plugs that were generated and tested in this task consisted of: 1. Aluminum hydroxide (NAH), 2. Sodium aluminosilicate (NAS), and 3. Sodium aluminum phosphate (NAP). While both solvents, namely 2 molar (2 M) nitric acid (HNO 3) and 2 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) at 60 °C, used in these tests were effective in dissolving the chemical plugs, the 2 M nitric acid was significantly more effective in dissolving the NAH and NAS plugs. The caustic was only slightly more effecting at dissolving the NAP plug. In the bench-scale dissolution tests, hot (60 °C) 2 M nitric acid was the most effective solvent in that it completely dissolved both NAH and NAS chemical plugs much faster (1. 5 – 2 x) than 2 M sodium hydroxide. So unless there are operational benefits for the use of caustic verses nitric acid, 2 M nitric acid heated to 60 °C C should be the solvent of choice for dissolving these chemical plugs. Flow-loop testing was planned to identify a combination of parameters such as pressure, flush solution, composition, and temperature that would effectively dissolve and <b>flush</b> each <b>type</b> of chemical plug from preformed chemical plugs in 3 -inch-diameter and 4 -feet-long pipe sections. However, based on a review {{of the results of the}} bench-top tests and technical discussions, the Waste Treatment Plant (WTP) Research and Technology (R&T), Engineering and Mechanical Systems (EMS), and Operations concluded that flow-loop testing of the chemically plugged pipe sections would not provide any additional information or useful data. The decision was communicated through a Sub Contract Change Notice (SCN- 070) that included a revised scope as follows: • Photographing the chemical plugs in the pipes before extrusion to compare the morphology of aged gels with that of fresh gels. • Setting up an extrusion apparatus and extruding the chemical plugs. • Documenting the qualitative observations on the efforts to remove the chemical plug materials from the pipe sections. • Performing X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis of extruded gel samples to detect any crystallization of gel during storage. • Disposing of the extruded gel as a waste. • Documenting the analytical results in a test report. There were no significant morphological differences between the fresh and aged plugs except for an overgrowth of small transparent crystals on the surface of the aged NAS gel plug. An initial pressure of 15 KPa for the NAS plug and from ~ 2 to 6 KPa for the NAH plug. Following extrusion, the NAP plug sections were thixotropic.

40|$|The near wall flow {{parameters}} in the blade end-wall corner region is investigated. The blade end-wall corner region was simulated by mounting an airfoil section (NACA 65 - 015 base profile) symmetric blades {{on both sides}} of the flat plate with semi-circular leading edge. The initial 7 cm from the leading edge of the flat plate was roughened by gluing No. 4 floor sanding paper to artificially increase the boundary layer thickness on the flat plate. The initial flow conditions of the boundary layer upstream of the corner region are expected to dictate the behavior of flow inside the corner region. Therefore, an experimental investigation was extended to study the combined effect of initial roughness and increased level of free stream turbulence on the development of a 2 -D turbulent boundary layer in the absence of the blade. The measurement techniques employed in the present investigation included, the conventional pitot and pitot-static probes, wall taps, the Preston tube, piezoresistive transducer and the normal sensor hot-wire probe. The pitot and pitot-static probes were used to obtain mean velocity profile measurements within the boundary layer. The measurements of mean surface static pressure were obtained with the surface static tube and the conventional wall tap method. The wall shear vector measurements were made with a specially constructed Preston tube. The <b>flush</b> mounted piezoresistive <b>type</b> pressure transducer were employed to measure the wall pressure fluctuation field. The velocity fluctuation measurements, used in obtaining the wall pressure-velocity correlation data, were made with normal single sensor hot-wire probe. At different streamwise stations, in the blade end-wall corner region, the mean values of surface static pressure varied more on the end-wall surface in the corner region were mainly caused by the changes in the curvature of the streamlines. The magnitude of the wall shear stress in the blade end-wall corner region increased significantly in the close vicinity of the corner line. The maximum value of the wall shear stress and its location from the corner line, on both the surfaces forming the corner region, were observed to change along the corner. These observed changes in the maximum values of the wall shear stress and its location from the corner line could be associated with the stretching and attenuation of the horseshoe vortex. The wall shear stress vectors in the blade end-wall corner region were observed to be more skewed on the end-wall surface as compared to that on the blade surface. The differences in the wall shear stress directions obtained with the Preston tube and flow visualization method were within the range in which the Preston tube was found to be insensitive to the yaw angle...|$|R

One of the solutions for this problem is pressure <b>flushing.</b> In this <b>type</b> of <b>flushing,</b> a mixture of water and sediment is removed from bottom outlets form dam reservoir and a funnel shaped crater is created {{in the vicinity of}} the outlet opening. In laboratory experiments carried out in this study, pressure flushing with the expansion of bottom outlet within the reservoir and its statistical analysis of bursting events were investigated. The structure of the turbulent flow is not fully understood {{due to the}}ir complexity and random nature. Klein et al. Introduced the turbulence bursting in this kind of flow and Nezo and Nakagora suggested that the events resulting from turbulence bursting has a significant effect of transferring the sediment particles. Materials and Methods: For the purposes of this study, the experiments were conducted with a physical model with 7 m length, 1. 4 m width, and 1. 5 m height, consisting of three parts namely the inlet of the model, the main reservoir, and settling basin. The main reservoir of the model was 5 m long and the sediments were placed within this part of the model. The sediment particles were non-cohesive silica with uniform size and with median diameter (d 50) 1. 15 mm and geometrics standard deviation (σg) 1. 37. Experiments carried out with different discharges and water depths above the bottom outlet in different expansion size of outlet channel in constant sediment level of 20 cm above the center of the outlet channel. The model was slowly filled with water until the water surface elevation reached to a desired level. The bottom outlet was manually opened, after a while sedimentwere discharged with the water flow in very high concentrations through the outlet channel (sudden discharge) and a funnel shaped crater was formed in front of it. After the run of each experiment, the bed level of scouring was measured using laser meters, and the volume of flushing cone was calculated by Surfer software. For investigation of turbulence parameters, the measurement of flow velocity in 0. 5 cm from the bed of flushing cone in the central axis of the outlet channel in the flow rate of 3 liters per second and water level of 47. 5 cm for three expansion sizes of the outlet channel (10, 20, and 30 cm) was performed. The flow velocity measurement was done using an Acoustic Doppler Velocimeter. This device is capable of measuring instantaneous velocity in three directions. Results and Discussion: The results indicated that the relative amount of bottom outlet channel expansion for 0. 5, 1 and 1. 5 times height of the sediments in the reservoir, leads to increase in flushing cone length for an average of 48, 83 and 113...|$|R

Mex. Se utilizaron 30 árboles, los cuales fueron catalogados de {{acuerdo a}} su última cosecha (2006) para formar tres tratamientos, 1) tratamiento carga alta (TCA) (˂ 100 kg árbol - 1), 2) tratamiento de carga baja (TCB) (> 50 kg árbol - 1) y 3) tratamiento carga {{intermedia}} (TCI) (50 - 100 kg árbol - 1). Los árboles emitieron tres flujos vegetativos, en invierno, verano y otoño. El efecto residual de la carga de frutos alta, se manifestó en mayor número de inflorescencias en comparación a TCI y TCB. Las inflorescencias indeterminadas, fueron de mayor proporción que las determinadas. Con relación a la dinámica nutrimental del aguacate ‘Hass’, sabemos que está influida por factores como manejo del huerto, condiciones ambientales, del suelo, fenología del cultivo y la carga de frutos. Se determinaron las concentraciones de N, P K, Ca, Mg, Mn, Cu, Zn, Fe y B en hojas de flujo de invierno y verano de los tratamientos TCA, TCI, y TCB. La concentración de N fue igual en los tres tratamientos en ambos flujos; lo mismo ocurrió para P, Mg y Zn. Respecto a K, se encontró que el TCA y TCB resultan superiores al TCI en el mes de mayo, en flujo de invierno. Para Ca, se observó que el TCA y TCI son superiores al TCB, en el mes de enero en el flujo de invierno; en el flujo de verano, TCI y TCB son superiores en agosto y noviembre respectivamente. Para Mn, el TCI es superior en febrero (flujo de invierno); y TCI es superior en julio y febrero en flujo de verano. Cu tuvo una concentración superior en el TCI y TCB en el mes de noviembre, y en enero, en el TCB para el flujo de invierno; en el flujo de verano el TCB es superior en julio, agosto y enero. Fe (flujo de Invierno), tiene una mayor concentración en el mes de enero en al TCB, y TCI es superior en febrero. Respecto a B, el TCB fue superior en junio en el flujo de invierno. _______________ ABSTRACT: In {{order to identify}} {{the relationship of the}} crop load in the <b>flush</b> vegetative, <b>type</b> of inflorescence and nutrient seasonal variation, took place from March 2007 to March 2008, this study in an orchard located in Temascaltepec, Edo. Mex. Were used 30 trees which were classified according to their last harvest to design the treatments, 1) High cop load treatment (TCA) (˂ 100 kg tree - 1), 2) Low crop load (TCB) (> 50 kg tree - 1), and 3) Intermediate crop load (TCI) (50 - 100 kg tree - 1). Trees issued three vegetative flushes in winter, summer and autumn. The residual effect of high crop load, there was a greater number of clusters compared with TCI and TCB. Indeterminate inflorescences were proportionally greater than those measured. Indeterminate inflorescences were proportionally greater than those measured. With regard to the nutrient dynamics of 'Hass' avocado, we know that is influenced by factors such as orchard management, environmental conditions, soil, plant phenology and crop load.

40|$|In situ {{chemical}} oxidation (ISCO) is a {{leading-edge technology}} for soil and groundwater remediation, and involves injecting a chemical oxidant (e. g., permanganate, hydrogen peroxide, or persulfate) into the subsurface to deplete contaminant mass through oxidation. Since {{the delivery of}} the chosen oxidant to the target treatment zone must occur in situ, {{the interaction between the}} injected oxidant and the aquifer material is a key controlling factor for a successful ISCO application. While many published ISCO studies have focused on the interaction between an oxidant and target contaminants, many questions still remain on the interaction between a potential oxidant and the aquifer material. Through a series of bench-scale experiments with aquifer materials collected from 10 sites throughout North America, the research presented in this thesis provides insight into the interaction between these aquifer materials and two widely used ISCO oxidants; permanganate and hydrogen peroxide. The investigation into the interaction between aquifer materials and permanganate consisted of three series of bench-scale experiments: (1) long-term batch experiments which were used to investigate permanganate consumption in response to fundamental geochemical properties of the aquifer materials, (2) short-term batch experiments which were designed to yield kinetic data that describe the behavior of permanganate in the presence of various aquifer materials, and (3) column experiments which were used to investigate permanganate transport in a system that mimics the subsurface environment. The long-term experiments which involved more than 180 batch reactors monitored for ~ 300 days showed that the unproductive permanganate consumption by aquifer materials or natural oxidant demand (NOD) is strongly affected by the initial permanganate concentration, permanganate to solid mass ratio, and the reductive components associated with each aquifer material. This consumption cannot be represented by an instantaneous reaction process but is kinetically controlled by at least a fast and slow reactive component. Accordingly, an empirical expression for permanganate NOD in terms of aquifer material properties, and a hypothetical kinetic model consisting of two reaction components were developed. In addition, a fast and economical permanganate NOD estimation procedure based on a permanganate COD test was developed and tested. The investigation into short-term permanganate consumption (time scale of hours) was based on the theoretical derivation of the stoichiometric reaction of permanganate with bulk aquifer material reductive components, and consisted of excess permanganate mass experiments and excess aquifer material mass experiments. The results demonstrated that permanganate consumption by aquifer materials can be characterized by a very fast reaction on the order of minutes to hours, confirming the existence of the fast reaction component of the hypothetical kinetic model used to describe the long-term permanganate NOD observations. A typical experimental column trial consisted of flushing an aquifer-material packed column with the permanganate source solution until sufficient permanganate breakthrough was observed. The permanganate column results indicated the presence of a fast and slow consumption rate consistent with the long-term batch test data, and an intermediate consumption rate affecting the shape of the rising limb of the breakthrough curve. Finally, a comparison of the experimental results between batch and column systems indicated that permanganate NOD was significantly overestimated by the batch experiments; however, permanganate consumption displayed some similarity between the batch and column systems and hence an empirical expression was developed to predict permanganate consumption in physically representative column systems from batch reactor data. The interaction between hydrogen peroxide and aquifer materials was also investigated with both batch and column experiments. A series of batch experiments consisting of a mixture of 2 % hydrogen peroxide and 15 g of aquifer materials was used to capture the overall hydrogen peroxide behavior in the presence of various aquifer materials. The results indicated that the decomposition of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of various aquifer materials followed a first-order rate law, and was strongly affected by the content of amorphous transition metals (i. e., Fe and Mn). Although hydrogen peroxide decomposition is related to the total organic carbon (TOC) content of natural aquifer materials, the results from a two-week long exposure to hydrogen peroxide suggests that not all forms of natural organic matter contributed to this decomposition. A multiple linear regression analysis was used to generate predictive relationships to estimate hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate coefficients based on various aquifer material properties. The enhanced stability of hydrogen peroxide was investigated under six scenarios with the addition of chelating reagents. The impact of a new green chelating reagent, S,S'-ethylenediaminedisuccinate (EDDS), on the stability of hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aquifer materials was experimentally examined and compared to that of the traditional and widely used chelating reagent, Ethylenediaminetetraacetic (EDTA). The results demonstrated that EDDS was able to significantly increase the stability of hydrogen peroxide, especially for aquifer materials with low TOC contents and/or high dissolvable Fe and Mn contents. Finally, to complement and expand the findings from the batch experiments, column experiments were conducted with aquifer materials from five representative sites. Each column was <b>flushed</b> with two <b>types</b> of source solutions (with or without EDDS addition) at two flow rates. The column experiments showed that the use of EDDS resulted in an earlier breakthrough and a higher stable concentration of hydrogen peroxide relative to the case without the addition of EDDS. The hydrogen peroxide decomposition rate coefficients generated from the column data were significantly higher than those generated from the batch test data and no correlation between hydrogen peroxide decomposition coefficients obtained from column and batch experiments was observed. Based on the column experimental results, a one-dimensional transport model was also calibrated to capture the hydrogen peroxide breakthrough process. Data from bench-scale tests are routinely used to support both ISCO design and site screening, and therefore the findings from this study can be used as guidance on the utility of these tests to generate reliable and useful information. In general, the behavior of both permanganate and hydrogen peroxide in the presence of aquifer materials in batch and the column systems clearly indicates that the use of batch test data for ISCO system design is questionable since column experiments are believed to mimic in situ conditions better since column systems provide more realistic aquifer material contact. Thus the scaling relationships developed in this study provide meaningful tools to transfer information obtained from batch systems, which are widely employed in most bench-scale studies, to column systems...|$|R
