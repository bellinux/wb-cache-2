Among 155 clinical respiratory isolates of Haemophilus influenzae in Korea, 6 (3. 9 %) isolates had reduced levofloxacin susceptibility (MICs ≥ 0. 5 μg/mL). These six isolates had no significant quinolone resistance-determining region (QRDR) mutations in gyrA, gyrB, parC, or parE. This phenomenon suggests that neither evolution nor spread of any significant QRDRs mutations in clinical isolates occurred in Korea.

Amino acid substitutions have generally been found within the quinolone resistance-determining region in subunit A of <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> (GyrA) of Salmonella Typhimurium.

We previously described that SecA (Secretory A) and Secretory Y (SecY), components of the membrane protein translocation machinery, and AcpP (Acyl carrier protein P) were involved in chromosome segregation and homeostasis of DNA topology. In the present work, we performed three-dimensional deconvolution of microscopic images and time-lapse experiments of these proteins together with MukB and DNA topoisomerases, and found that these proteins embraced the structures of tortuous nucleoids with condensed regions. Notably, SecA, SecY, and AcpP dynamically localized in cells, which was interdependent on each other requiring the ATPase activity of SecA. Our findings imply that the membrane protein translocation machinery plays a role in the maintenance of proper chromosome partitioning, possibly through "tethering" of MukB [a functional homolog of structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) proteins], DNA <b>gyrase,</b> <b>DNA</b> topoisomerase IV, and SeqA (Sequestration A) ...|$|E
40|$|DNA topoisomerases manage {{chromosome}} supercoiling {{and organization}} in {{all forms of}} life. Gyrase, a prokaryotic heterotetrameric type IIA topo, introduces negative supercoils into DNA by an ATP-dependent strand passage mechanism. All gyrase orthologs rely on a homologous set of catalytic domains for function; however, these enzymes also can possess species-specific auxiliary regions. The gyrases of many gram-negative bacteria harbor a 170 -amino acid insertion of unknown architecture and function in the metal- and DNA-binding TOPRIM domain of the GyrB subunit. We have determined {{the structure of the}} 212 [*]kDa Escherichia coli <b>gyrase</b> <b>DNA</b> binding and cleavage core containing this insert to 3. 1 [*]Å resolution. We find that the insert adopts a novel, extended fold that braces the GyrB TOPRIM domain against the coiled-coil arms of its partner GyrA subunit. Structure-guided deletion of the insert greatly reduces the DNA binding, supercoiling and DNA-stimulated ATPase activities of gyrase. Mutation of a single amino acid at the contact point between the insert and GyrA more modestly impairs supercoiling and ATP turnover, and does not affect DNA binding. Our data indicate that the insert has two functions, acting as a steric buttress to pre-configure the primary DNA-binding site, and serving as a relay that may help coordinate communication between different functional domains...|$|E

40|$|Homologous {{recombination}} is {{a fundamental}} biological process. Biochemical understanding {{of this process is}} most advanced for Escherichia coli. At least 25 gene products are involved in promoting genetic exchange. At present, this includes the RecA, RecBCD (exonuclease V), RecE (exonuclease VIII), RecF, RecG, RecJ, RecN, RecOR, RecQ, RecT, RuvAB, RuvC, SbcCD, and SSB proteins, as well as DNA polymerase I, DNA <b>gyrase,</b> <b>DNA</b> topoisomerase I, DNA ligase, and DNA helicases. The activities displayed by these enzymes include homologous DNA pairing and strand exchange, helicase, branch migration, Holliday junction binding and cleavage, nuclease, ATPase, topoisomerase, DNA binding, ATP binding, polymerase, and ligase, and, collectively, they define biochemical events that are essential for efficient recombination. In addition to these needed proteins, a cis-acting recombination hot spot known as Chi (chi: 5 '-GCTGGTGG- 3 ') plays a crucial regulatory function. The biochemical steps that comprise homologous recombination can be formally divided into four parts: (i) processing of DNA molecules into suitable recombination substrates, (ii) homologous pairing of the DNA partners and the exchange of DNA strands, (iii) extension of the nascent DNA heteroduplex; and (iv) resolution of the resulting crossover structure.

Both isomers had decreased potency against the isogenic ofloxacin-resistant (gyrA) strain and its purified enzyme, but the S isomer remained more potent than the R isomer. These studies, using a combined genetic and biochemical approach, demonstrate (i) that DNA gyrase is a target of the tricyclics ofloxacin and S- 25930, (ii) that serial exposure to ofloxacin can select resistance to tricyclic quinolone agents by mutation in the gyrA gene, and (iii) that the more potent antibacterial activity of S relative to R S- 25930 correlates with increased activity against DNA gyrase for both wild-type and ofloxacin-resistant (gyrA) isogenic strains...|$|E
40|$|Plasmids, {{extrachromosomal}} DNA, {{were identified}} in bacteria pertaining to family of Enterobacteriacae {{for the very first}} time. After that, they were discovered in almost every single observed strain. The structure of plasmids is made of circular double chain DNA molecules which are replicated autonomously in a host cell. Their length may vary from few up to several hundred kilobase (kb). Among the bacteria, plasmids are mostly transferred horizontally by conjugation process. Plasmid replication process can be divided into three stages: initiation, elongation, and termination. The process involves DNA helicase I, DNA <b>gyrase,</b> <b>DNA</b> polymerase III, endonuclease, and ligase. Plasmids contain genes essential for plasmid function and their preservation in a host cell (the beginning and the control of replication). Some of them possess genes whichcontrol plasmid stability. There is a common opinion that plasmids are unnecessary fora growth of bacterial population and their vital functions; thus, in many cases they can be taken up or kicked out with no lethal effects to a plasmid host cell. However,there are numerous biological functions of bacteria related to plasmids. Plasmids identification and classification are based upon their genetic features which are presented permanently in all of them, and these are: abilities to preserve themselves in a host cell and to control a replication process.

40|$|The {{fluoroquinolone}} antibiotics are structurally {{related to}} nalidixic acid.

We determined the activity of several fluoroquinolones in vitro against two strains of Plasmodium falciparum, FCC 1 (chloroquine susceptible) and VNS (chloroquine resistant). [3 H]hypoxanthine incorporation by malarial parasites was determined at 48 and 96 h. The molarity at which each agent caused a 50 % decrease in the incorporation of [3 H]hypoxanthine {{compared with that of}} drug-free controls was defined as the 50 % inhibitory concentration.

Other DNA gyrase inhibitors tested were nalidixic acid, oxolinic acid, novobiocin, and coumermycin A 1. Among the fluoroquinolones, ciprofloxacin had the lowest 50 % inhibitory concentrations at 48 h against both chloroquine-susceptible and -resistant strains of P. falciparum, (0. 26 +/- 0. 08) x 10 (- 4) and (0. 38 +/- 0. 15) x 10 (- 4) M, respectively (mean +/- standard deviation). Enoxacin had the lowest 50 % inhibitory concentrations against FCC 1 and VNS at 96 h, 0. 23 x 10 (- 5) and (0. 06 +/- 0. 04) x 10 (- 5) M, respectively. With the VNS strain, fractional inhibitory concentration indexes for the combination of ciprofloxacin and tetracycline were calculated at 48 and 96 h to be 0. 93 and 0. 79, respectively, indicating modest additive effects.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of DNA gyrase with ATP has been probed using {{a range of}} thiophosphate ATP analogs. ATP gammaS is not detectably hydrolyzed by gyrase but can support limited, probably catalytic, DNA supercoiling. ATP gammaS is a good inhibitor of both ATP hydrolysis and ATP-supported supercoiling. In contrast, both ATP alphaS(Rp) and ATP betaS(Rp) {{have been shown to}} be good substrates for the ATPase reaction of gyrase and to support catalytic DNA supercoiling. The corresponding Sp diastereoisomers do not support significant levels of supercoiling and are not readily hydrolyzed, but are shown to be reasonable inhibitors of gyrase. For ATP alphaS(Rp), the supercoiling and ATPase activities appear to be tightly coupled with the thionucleotide being apparently a better substrate than ATP in terms of both DNA supercoiling and nucleotide hydrolysis. In the case of ATP betaS(Rp), DNA supercoiling and nucleotide hydrolysis appear to be uncoupled in that ATP betaS(Rp) is almost as good a substrate as ATP for the ATPase reaction of both intact gyrase and the 43 kDa GyrB fragment, whereas it only supports slow DNA supercoiling; the mechanistic consequences of these observations are discussed in terms of a new model for energy coupling in <b>gyrase.</b> <b>DNA</b> gyrase has been shown to be capable of catalyzing DNA supercoiling in the presence of Mg 2 +, Ca 2 +, and Mn 2 + but not Zn 2 +, Co 2 +, Ni 2 +, or Cd 2 +. The pronounced diastereoselectivity seen in both the DNA supercoiling and ATPase activity with ATP alphaS and ATP betaS together with evidence from the X-ray structure of the 43 kDa GyrB-ADPNP-Mg complex is consistent with metal ion coordination at both of these sites, and probably to the gamma-phosphoryl center during turnover. Thus, the absolute configuration of the catalytically active Mg 2 +-ATP complex is likely to involve coordination to the pro-S oxygens at both P alpha and P beta, leading to the alpha,beta,gamma-tridentate Mg-ATP complex with the lambda-exo configuration. 4172...|$|E
40|$|DNA gyrase is {{the enzyme}} from {{bacteria}} which is unique among type II topoisomerases {{in its ability}} to introduce negative supercoils into DNA. The enzyme acts as an A 2 B 2 tetramer of molecular weight 374 kDa. The supercoiling reaction of gyrase involves wrapping of DNA around the enzyme and the coupling of ATP binding and hydrolysis to the passage of a DNA segment through a transient double strand break stabilised by gyrase, although its details are undefined. This reaction of gyrase is inhibited by two classes of anti-bacterial compounds, the quinolones and the coumarins. Hydroxyl radical footprinting was used to probe the complex between gyrase and a 198 bp DNA fragment containing the preferred gyrase cleavage site from plasmid pBR 322. Gyrase protects 128 bp from the hydroxyl radical with the central 13 bp (adjacent to the gyrase cleavage site) being most strongly protected. Flanking the central region are arms showing periodic protection from the reagent suggesting a helical repeat of 10. 6 bp, consistent with the DNA being wrapped upon the enzyme surface. The presence of 5 '-adenylyl,Y-imidodiphosphate (ADPNP) or a quinolone drag causes alteration of the protection pattern consistent with a conformational change in the complex involving one arm of the wrapped DNA. This is thought to represent an intermediate in the supercoiling cycle of gyrase. Protein-DNA crosslinking using the photoactivatable thymine analogue 4 -thiothymidine was used in an attempt to identify regions of gyrase involved in DNA binding. Complexes containing gyrase and 4 -thiothymidine-substituted DNA were irradiated with long-wave UV light to activate the photoreactive reagent. However, no protein-DNA crosslinks were detected. An attempt to radiolabel DNA-binding lysine residues of gyrase was also unsuccessful due to the dissociation of the gyrase-DNA complex upon modification of its lysines. Irradiation of <b>gyrase</b> <b>DNA</b> complexes with short-wave laser-UV light results in the formation of covalent protein-DNA complexes at an efficiency of ~ 1 %. Primer extension analysis was used to tentatively assign the crosslinks to two positions along the 147 bp DNA fragment used. The 43 kDa N-terminal domain of the gyrase B protein is responsible for ATP hydrolysis and also interacts with the coumarin class of gyrase inhibitors. To gain insight into the nature of the ATP-induced conformational change in the gyrase A 2 B 2 tetramer, the effect of the non-hydrolysable analogue ADPNP on the conformation and oligomeric state of the 43 kDa domain was examined. Protein crosslinking studies suggest that the protein exists as a monomer but dimerises in the presence of ADPNP. Limited trypsin proteolysis in the presence of ADPNP results in the protection of a 33 kDa N-terminal fragment of the protein (residues 2 - 307), consistent with an altered conformation of the 43 kDa domain {{in the presence of the}} nucleotide. The effects of the coumarin drugs novobiocin and coumermycin A 1 on the 43 kDa domain were also investigated. Novobiocin does not cause oligomerisation of the 43 kDa protein but coumermycin A 1 induces dimerisation when present at molar concentrations approaching half that of the 43 kDa protein. Limited trypsin digestion in the presence of either drug results in the protection of a 16 kDa proteolytic fragment from digestion (residues 111 - 247). Moreover, the products of trypsin digestion in the presence of novobiocin can stably bind novobiocin when denatured and renatured. The 16 kDa fragment was cloned and overexpressed as a direct gene product but was found to be incapable of stable novobiocin binding...|$|E

Reversible association between pradofloxacin and <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> or <b>DNA</b> topoisomerase IV in the target bacteria results in inhibition of these enzymes and rapid death of the bacterial cell. The rapidity and extent of bacterial killing are directly proportional to the drug concentration.|$|R
40|$|Like all hyperthermophiles yet tested, the {{bacterium}} Thermotoga maritima contains a reverse gyrase. Here {{we show that}} it contains also a <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase.</b> The genes top 2 A and top 2 B encoding the two subunits of a DNA gyrase-like enzyme have been cloned and sequenced. The Top 2 A (type II DNA topoisomerase A protein) is more similar to GyrA (<b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> A protein) than to ParC [topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) C protein]. The difference is especially striking at the C-terminal domain, which differentiates <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrases</b> from Topo IV. <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> activity was detected in T. maritima and purified to homogeneity using a novobiocin-Sepharose column. This hyperhermophilic <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> has an optimal activity around 82 – 86 °C. In contrast to plasmids from hyperthermophilic archaea, which are from relaxed to positively supercoiled, {{we found that the}} plasmid pRQ 7 from Thermotoga sp. RQ 7 is negatively supercoiled. pRQ 7 became positively supercoiled after addition of novobiocin to cell cultures, indicating that its negative supercoiling is due to the <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> of the host strain. The findings concerning <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> and negative supercoiling in Thermotogales put into question the role of reverse gyrase in hyperthermophiles...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] aminocoumarin [...] {{antibiotics}} {{are known}} inhibitors of <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase.</b> Antibiotics of the aminocoumarin family exert their therapeutic activity by binding tightly to the B subunit of bacterial <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase,</b> thereby inhibiting this essential enzyme. They compete with ATPfor binding to the B subunit of this enzyme and inhibit the ATP-dependent DNA supercoiling catalysed by gyrase. X-ray crystallography studies have confirmed binding at the ATP-binding site {{located on the}} gyrB subunit of <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase.</b> Their affinity for gyrase is considerably {{higher than that of}} modern fluoroquinolones, which also target <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> but at the gyrA subunit.|$|R
40|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> is a <b>DNA</b> topoisomerase {{indispensable}} for cellular functions in bacteria. We describe a novel, hither to unknown, mechanism ofspecific inhibition of Mycobacterium smegmatis and Mycobacterium tuberculosis <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> by a monoclonal antibody (mAb). Binding of them Ab {{did not affect}} either GyrA-GyrB or gyrase-DNA interactions. More importantly, the ternary complex of gyrase-DNA-mAb retained the ATP aseactivity of the enzyme and was competent to catalyse DNA cleavage-religation reactions, implying a new mode of action different from other classes of <b>gyrase</b> inhibitors. <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> purified from fluoroquinolone-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis and M. smegmatis were inhibited by the mAb. The absence of cross-resistance of the drug-resistant enzymes from two different sources to the antibody-mediated inhibition corroborates the new mechanism of inhibition. We suggest that binding of the mAb in {{the proximity of the}} primary dimer interface region of GyrA in the hetero tetrameric enzyme appears to block the release of the transported segment after strand passage, leading to enzyme inhibition. The specific inhibition of mycobacterial <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> with the mAb opens up new avenues for designing novel lead molecules for drug discovery and for probing gyrase mechanism...|$|R

The {{results showed that}} compound 3 k can strongly inhibit Staphylococcus aureus <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> and Bacillus subtilis <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> (with IC 50 of 0. 15 µg/mL and 0. 25 µg/mL, respectively).

50|$|Sparfloxacin, {{like other}} {{quinolones}} and fluoroquinolones, are bactericidal drugs, actively killing bacteria. Quinolones inhibit the bacterial <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> or the topoisomerase IV enzyme, thereby inhibiting DNA replication and transcription. Quinolones can enter cells easily and therefore {{are often used}} to treat intracellular pathogens such as Legionella pneumophila and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. For many gram-negative bacteria <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> is the target, whereas topoisomerase IV is the target for many gram-positive bacteria. Eukaryotic cells do not contain <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> or topoisomerase IV.|$|R
40|$|Novobiocin and coumermycin {{are known}} to inhibit the {{replication}} of DNA iing of DNA catalyzed by E. coli <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase,</b> a recently discovered enzyme that introduces negative superhelical turns into covalently circular DNA. The activity of <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> purified from a coumermycin-resistant mutant strain is resistant to both drugs. The inhibition by novobiocin of colicin E 1 plasmid DNA replication in a cell-free system is partially relieved by adding resistant <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase.</b> Both {{in the case of}} coliclls. DNA molecules which are converted to the covalently circular form in thepresence of coumermycin remain relaxed, instead of achieving their normal supercoiled conformation.

40|$|Seven {{quinolones}} {{were evaluated}} {{to determine whether}} their ability to generate the DNA gyrase-mediated cleavable complex correlated with their ability to inhibit the catalytic activity of purified <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> and inhibit the growth of Escherichia coli. The rank order of potency of these drugs in the cleavable-complex assay was {{essentially the same as}} in the DNA supercoiling-inhibition assay. It required 2 - to 10 -fold-lower drug concentrations to generate the cleavable complex than to inhibit E. coli <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase.</b> With the newer fluoroquinolones, a 25 - to 100 -fold-greater concentration was required for <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> inhibition than for cell growth inhibition, suggesting a more subtle interaction between these inhibitors and <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> than mere enzyme inhibition...|$|R
40|$|Cyclothialidine {{is a new}} <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> {{inhibitor}} {{isolated from}} Streptomyces filipinensis NR 0484. Structurally, it belongs to {{a new class of}} natural products containing a unique 12 -membered lactone ring that is partly integrated into a pentapeptide chain. Cyclothialidine was found {{to be one of the}} most active of all the <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> inhibitors tested in the DNA supercoiling reaction of Escherichia coli DNA gyrase; 50 % inhibitory concentrations (in micrograms per milliliter) of 0. 03 (cyclothialidine), 0. 06 (novobiocin), 0. 06 (coumermycin A 1), 0. 66 (norfloxacin), 0. 88 (ciprofloxacin), and 26 (nalidixic acid) were found. In addition, <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrases</b> from gram-positive species were inhibited equally as well as <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> from E. coli. Cyclothialidine also inhibited the in vitro DNA replication directed from oriC of E. coli. Among the bacterial species tested, only Eubacterium spp. were inhibited by cyclothialidine, suggesting that it can enter the cells of Eubacterium and exert antibacterial activity through interference with the <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> within the cells, although its penetration into most bacterial cells appears to be poor. These results provide a basis for cyclothialidine to be a lead structure for novel antibacterial agents with <b>DNA</b> <b>gyrase</b> inhibitory activities...|$|R
