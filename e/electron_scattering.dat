5|$|In high-mass main-sequence stars, the opacity is {{dominated}} by <b>electron</b> <b>scattering,</b> which is nearly constant with increasing temperature. Thus the luminosity only increases as the cube of the star's mass. For stars below 10 , the opacity becomes dependent on temperature, resulting in the luminosity varying approximately as the fourth power of the star's mass. For very low-mass stars, molecules in the atmosphere {{also contribute to the}} opacity. Below about 0.5 , the luminosity of the star varies as the mass to the power of 2.3, producing a flattening of the slope on a graph of mass versus luminosity. Even these refinements are only an approximation, however, and the mass-luminosity relation can vary depending on a star's composition.|$|E

25|$|OsO4 is {{a widely}} used {{staining}} agent used in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) to provide contrast to the image. As a lipid stain, it is also useful in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) {{as an alternative to}} sputter coating. It embeds a heavy metal directly into cell membranes, creating a high <b>electron</b> <b>scattering</b> rate without the need for coating the membrane with a layer of metal, which can obscure details of the cell membrane. In the staining of the plasma membrane, osmium(VIII) oxide binds phospholipid head regions, thus creating contrast with the neighbouring protoplasm (cytoplasm). Additionally, osmium(VIII) oxide is also used for fixing biological samples in conjunction with HgCl2. Its rapid killing abilities are used to quickly kill live specimens such as protozoa. OsO4 stabilizes many proteins by transforming them into gels without destroying structural features. Tissue proteins that are stabilized by OsO4 are not coagulated by alcohols during dehydration. Osmium(VIII) oxide is also used as a stain for lipids in optical microscopy. OsO4 also stains the human cornea (see safety considerations).|$|E
25|$|In {{electron}} beam lithography (EBL), an electron-sensitive resist is exposed to a beam of high-energy electrons. There is {{the choice of a}} positive or negative type resist; however, lower feature resolution can be obtained with negative resists. Patterns are created by programming the beam of electrons for the exact path to follow along the surface of the material. Resolution is affected by other factors such as <b>electron</b> <b>scattering</b> in the resist and backscattering from the substrate. EBL can create single surface features on the order of 3–5nm. If multiple features are required over a large surface area, {{as is the case in}} tissue engineering, the resolution drops and features can only be created as small as 30–40nm, and the resist development begins to weigh more heavily on pattern formation. To prevent dissolution of the resist, ultrasonic agitation can be used to overcome intermolecular forces. In addition, isopropyl alcohol (IPA) helps develop high-density arrays. EBL can become a quicker and less costly process by replicating nanometer patters in polymeric materials; the replication process has been demonstrated with polycaprolactone (PCL) using hot embossing and solvent casting. In a study conducted by Gomez et al. (2007), microchannels 1 and 2µm wide and 400 and 800nm deep created by EBL on PDMS were shown to enhance axon formation of hippocampal cells in culture more so than immobilized chemical cues.|$|E
