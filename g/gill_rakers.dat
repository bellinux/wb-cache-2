5|$|Both {{commercial}} and artisanal fisheries have targeted mantas for their meat and products. They are typically caught with nets, trawls and harpoons. Mantas were once captured by fisheries in California and Australia for their liver oil and skin; {{the latter were}} used as abrasives. Their flesh is edible and is consumed in some countries, but is unattractive compared to other fish. Demand for their <b>gill</b> <b>rakers,</b> the cartilaginous structures protecting the gills, has recently entered Chinese medicine. To fill the growing demand in Asia for <b>gill</b> <b>rakers,</b> targeted fisheries have developed in Philippines, Indonesia, Mozambique, Madagascar, India, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, Brazil and Tanzania. Each year, thousands of manta rays, primarily M. birostris, are caught and killed purely for their <b>gill</b> <b>rakers.</b> A fisheries study in Sri Lanka and India estimated that over 1000 were being sold in the country's fish markets each year. By comparison, M. birostris populations at most of the key aggregation sites {{around the world are}} estimated to have significantly fewer than 1000 individuals. Targeted fisheries for manta rays in the Gulf of California, the west coast of Mexico, India, Sri Lanka, Indonesia, and the Philippines have reduced populations in these areas dramatically.|$|E
5|$|Both {{species are}} listed as {{vulnerable}} by the International Union for Conservation of Nature. Anthropogenic threats include pollution, entanglement in fishing nets, and direct harvesting for their <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> for use in Chinese medicine. Their slow reproductive rate exacerbates these threats. They are protected in international waters by the Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals, but are more vulnerable closer to shore. Areas where mantas congregate are popular with tourists. Only a few public aquariums are large enough to house them.|$|E
25|$|These {{fish have}} muscular bodies, ossified bones, scales, well {{developed}} gills and central nervous systems, and large hearts and kidneys. Mesopelagic plankton feeders have small mouths with fine <b>gill</b> <b>rakers,</b> while the piscivores have larger mouths and coarser <b>gill</b> <b>rakers.</b> The vertically migratory fish have swimbladders.|$|E
40|$|Understanding the {{trophic ecology}} of closely-related species is {{important}} for providing insight on inter-specific competition and resource partitioning. Although catostomids often dom-inate fish assemblages in lotic systems, {{little research has been}} conducted on their ecology. This study was developed to provide information on the trophic ecology of catostomids in several Iowa rivers. Food habits, diet overlap, and <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology were examined for highfin carpsucker Carpiodes velifer, quillback C. cyprinus, river carpsucker C. carpio, golden redhorse Moxostoma erythrurum, shorthead redhorse M. macrolepidotum, silver redhorseM. anisurum, and northern hogsucker Hypentelium nigricans sampled from four Iowa rivers (2009). Diet overlap among all species was calculated with Moristas index (C). Food habit niche width was quantified with Levins index (B) and similarity in <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology was compared with analysis of covariance. Values from Moristas index suggested significant overlap in the diets of highfin carpsucker and river carpsucker (C = 0. 81), quill-back and river carpsucker (C = 0. 66), and shorthead redhorse and silver redhorse (C = 0. 67). Levins index indicated that golden redhorse (B = 0. 32), quillback (B = 0. 53), and river carpsucker (B = 0. 41) had the most generalized feeding strategies as their food niche widths were substantially wider than the other species. <b>Gill</b> <b>raker</b> length and spacing were positively correlated with the standard length of the fish for all species (<b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> length: r 2 = 0. 67 – 0. 88, P £ 0. 01; <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> spacing: r 2 = 0. 63 – 0. 73, P £ 0. 01). Slopes of regression of <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> length and spacing to standard lengths were significantly (P £ 0. 05) different among species, indicating that rates of change in <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology with body length varied among species. Differences in <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology likely allow catostomids to partition resources and reduce compet-itive interactions...|$|R
40|$|Considerable {{variation}} in morphology associated with resource {{use is a}} classic example of local adaptation to the environment. We demonstrate that a temporal change in feeding morphology might occur within a population. In a 5 -year natural field experiment, we estimated <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology, resource density and population dynamics of the roach and its competitor, the perch. Despite a {{variation in}} density of zooplankton resources and perch across years, no change in roach density was observed. However, <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology in roach covaried with size structure of the zooplankton resource across years. A laboratory experiment confirmed that <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> morphology has a great effect on roach foraging efficiency on zooplankton and that there is a functional trade-off with regard to zooplankton foraging. We suggest that the response in <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> structure is an adaptation to deal with the rapid population dynamics of zooplankton, which are in turn mediated by changes in the size structure of the competing perch...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{preliminary}} {{discussion of a}} case study that is underway to examine whether <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> number of Miyabe charr (Salvelinus malma miyabei) on Hokkaido, Japan is undergoing a rapid adaptive response to changing environmental conditions. The study involves two populations, one in Shikaribetsu Lake {{and the other in}} the Torizaki River. Preliminary data based on museum specimens and recently collected material suggest a rate of increase in <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> number in the Shikaribetsu Lake population over the past 60 years that is an order of magnitude greater than the estimated average rate of increase since the population became isolated about 10, 000 years ago. Conversely, <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> number in the Torizaki population has decreased since introduction about 30 years ago. We discuss both microevolution and phenotypic plasticity in relation to the observed changes. We emphasize the importance of natural history collections to the study of microevolution.

40|$|The <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> count, the {{intestine}} length, the intestine {{shape and}} the pyloric coeca count are examined {{in relation to}} growth, as well as, {{the relation between the}} weight of stomach content of fish and the plankton quantity in sea water are discussed. 1. The short <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> counts on the first gill arches of the young sardines from Gotô islands are conspicuously more than those of the adult. The same tendencies are noticeable on the <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> counts of this samples from first, second and third gill arch which increase proportionally to the body length in the other samples. 2. As not only the intestine length (ratio to the body length) but the pyloric coeca count of the young sardines (body length 9 - 10 cm) is nearly equal to those of the adult sardines, feeding habit of the former does not seem so different as from that of the latter. 3. The weight of the stomach content (ratio to the body weight) is approximately proportional to the plankton quantity in sea water.

25|$|Bathypelagic {{fish are}} black, or {{sometimes}} red, with few photophores. When photophores are used, {{it is usually}} to entice prey or attract a mate. Because food is so scarce, bathypelagic predators are not selective in their feeding habits, but grab whatever come close enough. They accomplish this by having a large mouth with sharp teeth for grabbing large prey and overlapping <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> which prevent small prey that have been swallowed from escaping.|$|E
25|$|The longfin {{trevally}} is a predatory fish, {{known to}} take a variety of small fishes, cephalopods including squid, and crustaceans such as crabs and mantis shrimp. The species' long <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> also help to filter minute organisms from the seawater, adding to the fish's diet. Longfin trevallies reach sexual maturity at 21 to 22cm in length. There has been no research into their spawning patterns, although it is known juveniles inhabit shallow bays and occasionally estuaries.|$|E
25|$|Cyprinids are stomachless {{fish with}} toothless jaws. Even so, food can be {{effectively}} chewed by the <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> of the specialized last gill bow. These pharyngeal teeth allow {{the fish to}} make chewing motions against a chewing plate formed by a bony process of the skull. The pharyngeal teeth are unique to each species and are used by scientists to identify species. Strong pharyngeal teeth allow fish such as the common carp and ide to eat hard baits such as snails and bivalves.|$|E

40|$|Invasion {{of exotic}} species {{has caused the}} loss of {{biodiversity}} and imparts evolutionary and ecological changes in the introduced systems. In northern Fennoscandia, European whitefish (Coregonus lavaretus (L.)) is a highly polymorphic species displaying adaptive radiations into partially reproductively isolated and thus genetically differentiated sympatric morphs utilizing the planktivorous and benthivorous food niche in many lakes. In 1993, Lake Skrukkebukta was invaded by vendace (Coregonus albula (L.)) which is a zooplanktivorous specialist. The vendace displaced the densely rakered whitefish from its preferred pelagic niche to the benthic habitat harbouring the large sparsely rakered whitefish. In this study, we investigate the potential influence of the vendace invasion on the breakdown of reproductive isolation between the two whitefish morphs. We inferred the genotypic and phenotypic differentiation between the two morphs collected at the arrival (1993) and 15 years after (2008) the vendace invasion using 16 microsatellite loci and <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> numbers, the most distinctive adaptive phenotypic trait between them. The comparison of <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> number distributions revealed two modes growing closer over 15 years following the invasion. Bayesian analyses of genotypes revealed that the two genetically distinct whitefish morphs that existed in 1993 had collapsed into a single population in 2008. The decline in association between the <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> numbers and admixture values over 15 years corroborates {{the findings from the}} Bayesian analysis. Our study thus suggests an apparent decrease of reproductive isolation in a morph-pair of European whitefish within 15 years (. ...|$|R

25|$|Woodward {{initially}} assigned Leedsichthys to the Acipenseroidea, {{considering it}} {{related to the}} sturgeon, having the large <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> and branching finrays in common. In 1905, he changed this to the Pachycormidae. The Pachycormidae have a somewhat uncertain position. Often they are considered very basal Teleostei — if so, Leedsichthys would be the largest known teleost — others see them {{as members of a}} Pachycormiformes forming the sister group of the Teleostei, and sometimes they are seen as even more basal Amiiformes. In the latter case the extant bowfin, Amia calva, would be the closest living relative of Leedsichthys.|$|E

25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, flabby body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
25|$|The toothless {{mouth is}} small and terminal, ending in a pointed snout. As in related {{families}} (e.g. Argentinidae), an epibranchial or crumenal organ is present behind the fourth gill arch.

25|$|Threespine {{sticklebacks}} (Gasterosteus spp.) in post-glacial {{lakes in}} western Canada have {{contributed significantly to}} recent research of character displacement. Both observations of natural populations and manipulative experiments show that when two recently evolved species occur in a single lake, two morphologies are selected for: a limnetic form that feeds in open water and a benthic form that feeds at the lake bottom. They differ in size, shape and the number and length of <b>gill</b> <b>rakers,</b> {{all of which is}} related to divergence in their diet. Hybrids between the two forms are selected against. When only one species inhabits a lake, that fish displays an intermediate morphology. Studies on other fish species have shown similar patterns of selection for benthic and limnetic morphologies, which can also lead to sympatric speciation.|$|E
25|$|Like {{the largest}} fish today, the whale sharks and basking sharks, Leedsichthys problematicus derived its {{nutrition}} as a suspension feeder, using {{an array of}} specialised <b>gill</b> <b>rakers</b> lining its gill basket to extract zooplankton, small animals, from the water passing through its mouth and across its gills. It is less clear whether also phytoplankton, algae, {{were part of the}} diet. Leedsichthys could have been a ram feeder, making the water pass through its gills by swimming, but could also have actively pumped the water through the gill basket. In 2010, Liston suggested that fossilised furrows discovered in ancient sea floors in Switzerland and attributed to the activity of plesiosaurs, had in fact been made by Leedsichthys spouting water through its mouth to disturb and eat the benthos, the animals dwelling in the sea floor mud.|$|E

40|$|Natural {{hybridization}} plays a {{key role}} in the process of speciation. However, anthropogenic (human induced) hybridization of historically isolated taxa raises conservation issues. Due to weak barriers to gene flow and the presence of endangered taxa, the whitefish species complex is an excellent study system to investigate the consequences of hybridization in conservation. We focused on three naturally reproductively isolated whitefish taxa in Germany: the endangered, anadromous North Sea houting (NSH) and Baltic houting (BH), which were reintroduced after local extinction, and the commercially stocked European whitefish (EW). To evaluate the genetic integrity of each taxon, source and reintroduced populations of NSH and BH, and EW populations were characterized based on two mitochondrial and 17 microsatellite loci. Additionally, we investigated <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> counts as an adaptive phenotypic trait. Even though clear genetic and phenotypic differentiation confirmed the houtings as separate evolutionarily significant units, admixture analyses revealed an extensive hybrid zone. Hybridizations were introgressive, positively correlated with genetic diversity, and were reflected in the <b>gill</b> <b>raker</b> counts. The BH distribution range showed higher heterogeneity and stronger admixture than the NSH range. Erroneous stocking with non-native genotypes best explained these patterns, which pose challenges for the conservation of the endangered NSH and BH...|$|R
