40|$|Preliminary notes This paper {{analyzes}} theoretically {{the motion}} {{and flow of}} eight fruit types, along rotating <b>sizing</b> <b>machines.</b> It starts from differential equation of fruit motion on a rotating disk of the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b> A universal method that can generally be applied to determine the flow {{of all types of}} rotary <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> is developed. Flow analysis comprised sized fruit mass and flow. New empirical coefficients were introduced: extent ratio, feed ratio and distribution ratio. In particular, the influence of the relative speed of fruit on the capacity of <b>sizing</b> <b>machines</b> is researched. The results obtained for the adopted values extend, feed and distribution ratio ke = 0, 7; kf = 1; kd = 0, 5 coincide approximately with those reported to date for fruit flow rate on <b>sizing</b> <b>machines.</b> It was found that flow rates vary considerably, depending on fruit diameter and mass. Fruit numbers flow ranges from 8949 crops/h for apple to 40. 157 crops/h for deep frozen raspberry. Mass flow varies from 229, 1 kg/h for cherry to 2054, 7 kg/h for apple...|$|R

Analysis of composition of tension & elongation in different zone on <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b> By means of mechanical device and electric sensor, as well as frequency conversion speed regulator controlled by PLC, the sizing warp tension &elongation has been regulated precisely.

40|$|Traditionally, {{rolling process}} {{is widely used}} to achieve width {{reduction}} in hot strip milling production. However, there 2 ̆ 7 ve been some drawbacks about the conventional methods that cannot be ignored, such as dog-bone profile and seam-effect. While on the other hand, the new width reduction method-slab sizing process offers decisive advantages over the conventional edging process {{in response to the}} drawbacks mentioned above. The objective of this thesis is to simulate the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine,</b> identify the advantages of sizing process over edging process, and compare the performance of <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> under different boundary conditions. In order to achieve these goals, this thesis develops a numerical model for the vertical <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> under typical operation conditions and conducts a structural finite element analysis of the model. In addition, the simulation results are validated by the field inspection data. Finally, a prediction of the remaining equipment life is made {{based on the results of}} the fatigue analysis. ...|$|R
50|$|Before mechanisation, the sizing {{process was}} a time {{consuming}} task. The weaver painted the size onto the warp as it lay on the loom, then fanned it dry before weaving the cloth. The <b>sizing</b> <b>machine</b> improved the process by sizing a warp before putting it into the loom. The warp threads are first wound onto a large beam, which is then placed {{at one end of}} the <b>sizing</b> <b>machine.</b> Then the warp is drawn off the beam and passes through a bath of boiling size, between sets of rollers and cooled, dried and rewound onto another beam. It is then ready to be woven.|$|R

At this time hanks from one spinner would all be the same size, as they would have been made on the same niddy noddy, thus only one diameter was needed.|$|R

40|$|Small size ultra-precision Computer Numerical Control (CNC) {{machines}} require high dynamic performance.

This allowed improving the servo bandwidth by 58 % based on a PID controller. A new technique for real-time dynamic displacement measurements using accelerometer was developed.

40|$|The {{design of}} ferrite-assisted {{synchronous}} reluctance machines is investigated, with {{particular attention to}} the pivotal aspect of avoiding irreversible de-magnetization.

Such demagnetization limit shows to be depending on the operating temperature and the <b>machine</b> <b>size.</b> Furthermore, the comparison between the continuous load and de-magnetization conditions shows that low and medium <b>size</b> <b>machines</b> can be stiffer against demagnetization, with respect to larger machines, and have room for transient overload.

30|$|The {{process of}} size {{reduction}} is energy intensive. For the proper optimization {{and design of}} biomass size-reduction equipment, the mechanical properties should be well known.
