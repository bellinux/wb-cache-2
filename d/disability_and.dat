40|$|This {{study was}} aimed to {{investigate}} {{to what extent}} impairments, <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> handicaps are used as diagnostic assessments and treatment goals in logopedics. Traditionally, logopedists are mainly concerned with impairments. These days, increasing attention is demanded for <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> handicaps as well. A survey study was carried out on 1, 567 patients in logopedic practices in the Netherlands to provide an empirical quantitative description of diagnostic assessments and treatment goals, formulated in terms of impairments, <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> handicaps. Results show that logopedists indeed often indicate impairments as diagnostic assessments and as treatment goals, particularly language development impairments and phonetic/phonological articulation impairments. Interestingly, also large numbers of diagnostic assessments and treatment goals were indicated {{at the level of}} <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> handicaps; the most important being disability in expressing communication and occupational handicap. These results demonstrate that <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> handicaps may serve an important function in logopedics, in that they may guide assessment as well as therapy. It is concluded that <b>disabilities</b> <b>and</b> handicaps should be considered in the future development of the profession of logopedics. (aut. ref. ...|$|R

He is kidnapped by Nick Thompson (Marty Grimwood) and Laura Davidson (Jodi Flockhart), who want money from Paul. Laura {{eventually}} frees Declan and he is found by Rebecca, Paul and Oliver. Bridget believes Declan cannot handle her <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> she starts dating Josh Taylor (Liam Hemsworth). At an illegal dance party, Bridget, Josh and Declan become trapped when the roof falls in. Declan manages to carry Josh out before coming back for Bridget.

He is arrested and kisses a football groupie, but he later returns and commits to Bridget and the baby. When Declan tries to rescue Elle Robinson's (Pippa Black) cat, he receives an electric shock. This makes him think about his life and he proposes to Bridget, who accepts. A few months later, Declan and Bridget marry in front of their friends.|$|E

United Verde, seeking stable labor relations, added <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> life insurance benefits for its workers and built a baseball field, tennis courts, swimming pools, and a public park in Jerome.

5|$|A {{person with}} MS can have almost any {{neurological}} symptom or sign, with autonomic, visual, motor, and sensory problems {{being the most}} common. The specific symptoms {{are determined by the}} locations of the lesions within the nervous system, and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling, pins and needles or numbness, muscle weakness, blurred vision, very pronounced reflexes, muscle spasms, or difficulty in moving; difficulties with coordination and balance (ataxia); problems with speech or swallowing, visual problems (nystagmus, optic neuritis or double vision), feeling tired, acute or chronic pain, and bladder and bowel difficulties, among others. Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common. Uhthoff's phenomenon, a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures, and Lhermitte's sign, an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck, are particularly characteristic of MS. The main measure of <b>disability</b> <b>and</b> severity is the expanded disability status scale (EDSS), with other measures such as the multiple sclerosis functional composite being increasingly used in research.|$|E
5|$|Augmentative and {{alternative}} communication {{is used by}} individuals to compensate for severe speech-language impairments in the expression or comprehension of spoken or written language. People making use of AAC include individuals {{with a variety of}} congenital conditions such as cerebral palsy, autism, intellectual <b>disability,</b> <b>and</b> acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, traumatic brain injury and aphasia. Prevalence data vary depending on the country and age/disabilities surveyed, but typically between 0.1 and 1.5% of the population are considered to have such severe speech-language impairments that they have difficulty making themselves understood, and thus could benefit from AAC. An estimated 0.05% of children and young people require high technology AAC. Well-known AAC users include physicist Stephen Hawking, broadcaster Roger Ebert and poet Christopher Nolan. Award-winning films such as My Left Foot and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, based on books by AAC users Christy Brown and Jean-Dominique Bauby respectively, have brought the lives of those who use AAC to a wider audience.|$|E

Despite his low intelligence quotient, Forrest's new running ability leads to him receiving a football scholarship to the University of Alabama in the early 1960s, becoming a top running back, being named on the All-American team, and meeting President John F. Kennedy. After his college graduation, he enlists in the US Army, where he befriends a fellow soldier named Bubba, who convinces Forrest to go into the shrimping business with him when the war is over. In 1967, they are sent to Vietnam and, during an ambush, Bubba is killed in action. Forrest saves many of his platoon, including his Lieutenant, Dan Taylor, who loses both his legs.
