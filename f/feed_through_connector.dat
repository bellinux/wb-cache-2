40|$|DE 102009013355 A 1 UPAB: 20101002 NOVELTY - The {{arrangement}} has a {{base body}} (14) {{provided with a}} <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> (13) for an optical waveguide. The optical waveguide {{is led by the}} <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> in a region of ends, and includes a core (11) and a cladding (12). The optical waveguide is partly metalized in region of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> on the cladding. An electroplating (15) is in thermal contact with the base body. An optical reflector (16) is arranged between ends of the optical waveguide and the <b>feed</b> <b>through.</b> The optical reflector encloses the optical waveguide, and reflects scattered radiation. USE - Coupling arrangement for an optical waveguide i. e. optical fiber. ADVANTAGE - The optical waveguide is partly metalized in the region of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> on the cladding, and the electro plating is in the thermal contact with the base body, thus reducing cost, and achieving higher performances. The micro drilling is performed such that the electro plating is preferably located in direct contact with the inner wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>through,</b> thus providing an additional heat conducting medium between electroplating and the inner wall of the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> to improve the heat conducting contact...|$|R

40|$|This paper, we {{analyzed}} that the measured {{data of the}} radiated power spectrum of electromagnetic waves of the normal spark ignition system and the spark ignition system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser. The {{results show that the}} strength of power spectrum radiated from the system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser is weaker than the normal system, and the density of power spectrum radiated from the system with <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser is smaller than the normal system. From these results, the <b>feed</b> <b>through</b> type ceramic condenser can reduce the electromagnetic waves radiating from the spark ignition system which is the spurious emission, and it can be concluded that the ignition coil of the spark ignition system generating high voltage pulse is equivalent to the radio frequency oscillator which is oscillating hig...|$|R
