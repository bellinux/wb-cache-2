40|$|Over {{the past}} few years, with the rapid {{adoption}} of broadband communication and advances in multimedia content capture and delivery, web-based meetings and lectures, {{also referred to as}} <b>emeeting</b> and e-lecture, have become popular among businesses and academic institutions because of their cost savings and capabilities in providing self-paced education and convenient content access and retrieval. In fact, the technological achievements in capture, analysis, access, and delivery of <b>emeeting</b> and e-lecture media have already resulted in several working systems that are currently of regular usage. This paper gives an overview of existing work as well as state-of-the-art in these two research areas which are bound to affect the way we teach, learn, and collaborate. 1...|$|E
40|$|People are an {{important}} part of many business processes. Current workflow-based implementations of business processes constrain users to the desktop environment; require them to periodically check for pending tasks; and do not support direct or synchronous people-to-people interaction. On the other hand, the wide spectrum of people collaboration tools ranging from telephones to instant messaging and to email have no provision for structured collaboration and are separate from business processes. � We have designed and implemented a system, dubbed PerCollab, that integrates workflow and collaboration technologies. It allows people to participate in business processes from anywhere using a traditional collaboration mechanism. It proactively engages users in business processes by pushing interaction to a convenient device of the users. PerCollab uses an extended BPEL to formally define business processes with human partners and exploits dynamic user context to solve the personal mobility problem. Our prototype implementation integrates a variety of collaboration tools: instant messaging, email and <b>emeeting.</b> 1...|$|E

We propose an approach that combines context data collected from physical motion and RFID sensors (the sensed environment), <b>eMeeting</b> software instrumentation, user preferences and online user models. A significant problem with eMeetings spread across multiple locations is the determination of meeting attendance (both locally and remotely), an understanding of geographical location along with an understanding of the social or working relationships of the meeting participants. We first report on the motivation for VALUE, following this we describe our general VALUE architecture based on an adapted Workplace system coupled with an embedded RFID architecture across 5 buildings in a campus with 5, 000 employees. We conclude with a discussion of our approach based on an informal user study with 150 users across 2 days as well as reflecting on the lessons learnt from this study. 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} client/server-based un-intrusive {{collaborative}} multimedia application- called eMeeting- that extracts and archives salient visual information from seminars, while allowing interaction among presenters and the audience in real time. The application uses API's of the Lotus Sametime ® system such as secure login, directory, meeting and multimedia services, to which we have added our own extensions. These extensions use the binary messaging channel of Sametime and allow us to add stroke-based chat as well as stroke-based annotations of slides. This permits communication among all clients. In parallel with the services just mentioned {{and in the same}} Java application, users of <b>eMeeting</b> are presented with slides that the system extracts from the presenter's visual material using an automatic recognition algorithm that classifies video frames as slides. At this time we assume that the system {{may or may not have}} access to the visual content in electronic form. Users can follow the seminar in the form of presenter's video, and as a series of extracted images. The server transmits the slides cyclically to each user using IP multicast giving each client the opportunity to select any previous slide. Thus, late joiners can browse slides that have been accumulated by the system...|$|E
