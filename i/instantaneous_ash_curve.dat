40|$|The Sink - Float {{analysis}} {{is a method}} of investigation of impurities bounded in coal using liquids of different specific gravities. A sample of 0. 5 kg of Maiganga coal was poured into a solution of zinc chloride having different densities of 1. 00, 1. 10, 1. 20, 1. 30, 1. 40, 1. 50, 1. 60, 1. 70, 1. 80, 1. 90 and 2. 00. The floats and sinks {{in each of these}} densities were obtained and used to calculate the cumulative float, cumulative sink, <b>instantaneous</b> <b>ash</b> and distribution of ash; these values were then used to develop the respective partition curves (washability curve) which were obtained by plotting the partition coefficient against the mean of its density range. A sink - float problem was tested using the partition curves obtained. A yield of 80 % was considered where the clean coal contains 16. 45 % ash with rejects of 70. 18 % ash separated at a specific gravity of 1. 7. The separation with a distribution value of 5 % becomes easy according to Burt (2004), Herbst (2005), Mills (2008) and Bird (2001) that if a low value less than 10 % for the distribution is recorded, the separation becomes easy, while a value more than 20 % gives a very difficult separation...|$|R
40|$|The {{technique}} of electrothermal atomization {{atomic absorption spectrometry}} (ETA-AAS) is widely used {{for the analysis of}} samples originating from many sources, such as from the industry and from the environment. Many of these analyses which are performed, are vital for the operation, quality control and monitoring of the products produced in the industry, as well as the byproducts and effluents produced by these processes. Unfortunately, many of these analyses are prone to interferences, which lead to troublesome, inaccurate and costly analyses. Traditionally, chemical modifiers were used to overcome these interferences, but owing to certain limitations of these modifiers, a need arose for a new type of modifier. The envisaged modifier must be able {{to improve the quality of}} analyses by improving the sensitivity, detection limits and versatility of the conventional chemical modifiers. This investigation involves the use of a low pressure argon glow discharge. The discharge will sputter a solid metal chemical modifier, such as iridium or rhodium, onto the inside of a graphite tube to produce a permanent modifier. To begin with, the operational characteristics and optimization of the sputtering process for each of the modifiers were investigated. Secondly, the <b>ashing</b> <b>curves</b> and other analytical performance characteristics were determined for Pb and As in three matrices, namely sulphate, nitrate and chloride using the permanent modifiers. The analytical characteristics of the permanent modifiers were compared to the performances of the conventional chemical modifiers and comparisons and conclusions were drawn as to the performance and effectiveness of the permanent modifiers.

40|$|Natural oils such as {{pine oil}} and {{eucalyptus}} oil {{were used in}} metalliferrous flotation, principally as frothers, {{in the early days}} of flotation In recent years synthetic collectors and frothers have taken over, largely because the complex chemistry and wide variation in natural oils results in poor control of their consistency as flotation reagents. Australia, however, has enormous potential as a supplier of eucalyptus oils. If one or more eucalypt species were identified as desirable sources of coal flotation reagents, it would be logical to cultivate them in industrial plantations on mine sites and to have this form of land use accepted as a satisfactory end point for rehabilitation. Such an outcome would have multiple benefits for the mining industry. Essential oils derived from eucalypts are composed predominantly of terpenes, compounds which contain a sequence of two or more isoprene units (C 5 H 8). Gas Chromatography (GC) tests, coupled with Mass Spectrometry (MS) and Flame Ionisation Detection (FID) were carried out on oils from ten different eucalypt species in order to identify those oils, or their constituents, that might have useful properties for the flotation of coal. The action of eucalyptus oils as flotation reagents in terms of surface property parameters of a two-phase system were investigated. Bubble size and foamability measurements were done to evaluate foamability indices and the critical coalescence concentrations in order to characterise the oils 2 ̆ 7 applicability as frothers (relative to MIBC).

40|$|In Australia, coal {{washability}} analysis, {{which is}} used to obtain the cumulative yield—ash % relationship—has traditionally been generated using the float-sink method AS 4156. 1 - 1994. This technique relies on heavy organic liquids to fractionate coal and mineral particles based on particle density. These organic liquids are considered problematic for health, safety, and environmental reasons. This paper examines water-based methods for attaining coal washability data for - 50 + 0. 045 mm particles, covering a water fluidization method based on the Reflux Classifier, and two batch jigging devices. Data produced by the three methods are compared with results obtained using the float-sink method. The cumulative yield versus cumulative <b>ash</b> <b>curves</b> generated by all three methods were found to be in reasonable agreement with the data obtained using the float-sink method, but with a consistent discrepancy evident at relatively low ash levels. The discrepancy was attributed to the effects of dispersion, a phenomenon inherent in most particle separation processes. The fractionation achieved using the Reflux Classifier required further fractionation by size separation, while the two jigs generally required no fractionation by size provided the initial size range was not too broad. The Boner Jig, in which the vessel is moved up and down at a given frequency and amplitude, showed the best performance on the - 16 + 0. 25 mm sizerange. The Mintek Jig, in which the upward fluid flow is varied, showed the best performance on the - 50 + 16 mm size range. For the ultrafine particles, covering the size range - 0. 25 + 0. 045 mm, the Reflux Classifier proved to be the ideal choice, achieving higher yields than multistage flotation. It was also demonstrated, using the data from the Reflux Classifier, that the ‘‘true’’ washability data could be deduced mathematically by combining a model of the separation process, with the normalized partition curve...|$|R
30|$|Figure  1 a {{shows that}} the FT-IR {{spectrum}} (curve 1) of Wucaiwan coal sample is consistent with that of other coal samples (Saikia et al. 2008; Manoj and Elcey 2010; Balachandran 2014). Three types of peaks were found: (1) the peaks at 2923 and 1376  cm− 1 correspond to the aliphatic structure; (2) the peaks at 3050, 1585, 826, and 763  cm− 1 are the characteristic peaks of aromatic ring; (3) the peaks at 3350, 1715, 1250  cm− 1 are assigned to the oxygen-containing functional groups. The band between 400 and 600  cm− 1 relates to the <b>ash.</b> <b>Curve</b> 2 represents the FT-IR spectrum of the coal sample after HNO 3 treatment at 25  °C for 24  h. The shape of curve 2 is almost {{the same as that}} of curve 1 except the decrease of the band between 400 and 600  cm− 1 and the increase of the peaks at 1715 and 1250  cm− 1, indicating that treating raw coal sample with HNO 3 at room temperature aided in the removal of ash and the increase of oxygen-containing functional groups in the structure of coal. Curve 3 is the FT-IR spectrum of the coal sample after 24  h of reflux. It {{shows that the}} intensities of the adsorption at 1715 and 1250  cm− 1 further increase for sample 3. Besides that, a weak band appeared between 3000 and 2500  cm− 1 and a single peak showed up at 1538  cm− 1, corresponding to the adsorption of COOH and C–NO 2 group, respectively. In addition, both the peak of O–H group at 3350  cm− 1 and the peak of aliphatic structure at 2923  cm− 1 decrease, and the peak at 1376  cm− 1 assigned to the aliphatic structure disappeared, and also the band between 400 and 600  cm− 1 associated with the ash almost disappeared. The results of ultimate analysis and FT-IR demonstrate that treating Wucaiwan coal sample with HNO 3 under reflux condition not only was efficient in removing the ash in the coal but also introduced oxygen-containing groups such as nitro group into the organic structure of coal and reduced the content of aliphatic structure relatively.|$|R
40|$|A feed of {{particles}} covering {{a wide range}} of particle sizes and densities was placed into a novel separator, referred to as the Reflux Classifier, and fractionated at a series of fluidization velocities. Double fractionation was then achieved when each product was sieved into narrow size fractions. For the coal particles used in this study, the ash % was determined for each of the samples. The ash % correlated strongly with particle density, and hence was a useful proxy for the particle density. A new Fractionation Algorithm was developed, which provided a method for estimating the feed size and density distribution from the Double Fractionation data. The cumulative yield % versus the cumulative <b>ash</b> % <b>curves</b> for each size fraction, and for the overall feed were then determined. The findings from the study were validated against accurate results obtained using the sink-float method. Excellent agreement with the curves obtained using the sink-float method was obtained. The sink-float method requires the use of heavy liquids; these are invariably toxic and expensive, hence a viable alternative is needed. The water based fractionation method, in conjunction with the Fractionation Algorithm, may prove to be a suitable substitute for the sink-float method. Precise details of the method and algorithm are therefore provided in order to permit the adoption of this new approach by other laboratories...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} has three purposes I {{to make a}} comparative chemical study on sediment cores collected for Lake Lisgar (man-made lake in an urban center) and Lake Hunger (natural basin in a rural community) encompassing the time since European settlement I to determine the postglacial chemical history of Lake Hunger, and to determine the vegetational history of the Lake Hunger area from postglacial time to the present. The minus 80 mesh fraction of 108 soil samples and 18 stream sediment samples collected {{in the vicinity of}} Lakes' Lisgar and Hunger were analyzed for cold hydrochloric acid soluble lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, copper, aluminum, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese. Lacustrine sediments from 5 boreholes in the Lake Lisgar basin were collected. Boreholes 1, 2, 3, and 4 were analyzed for palynological and chemical information and Borehole 5 was subjected to pollen and ostracode analysis. Lacustrine sediments from 6 boreholes in the Lake Hunger basin were collected. Palyno- -logical and chemical analysis were performed on Boreholes 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 and Borehole 5 was analyzed for pollen. In addition, radiocarbon dates were obtained on sediment samples from Boreholes 4 and 5. A total of 8 surface samples were collected from the margins of the Lake Hunger basin and these were chemically analyzed in the laboratory. All of the lacustrine sediments were ashed and analyzed for cold hydrochloric acid soluble lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, copper, aluminum, sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese using a Perkin Elmer 40) Atomic Absorption spectrophotometer. The results. obtained for the 12 elements were expressed as parts per million in dry sediments. It was found that man's influence on the element distribution patterns in the sediments of Lake Lisgar appeared to be related to his urbanizing developments within the lake vicinity, whereas, the rural developments in the vicinity of lake Hunger appeared to have had little effect on the element distribution patterns in the lake sediments. The distribution patterns of lead, zinc, nickel, cobalt, aluminum, magnesium, sodium and potassium are similar to the % <b>ash</b> <b>curve</b> throughout postglacial time indicating that the rate of erosion in the drainage basin is the main factor which controls the concentration of these elements in the sediments of Lake Hunger. The vegetational history, from palynological analysis, of Lake Hunger from postglacial time to the present includes the following stages: tundra, open spruce forest, closed boreal forest, deciduous forest and the trend towards the re-establishment of pine following the clearing of land and the subsequent settlement of the Lake Hunger area by European settlers. The concentrations of some elements (cobalt, nickel, iron, manganese, calcium, magnesium, sodium and potassium) in the sediments of Lake Hunger appears to be higher during pre-cultural compared to post-cultural times. At least one complete postglacial record of the chemical history within a lake basin is necessary in order to accurately assess man's effects on his environment...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe soil–water {{characteristic}} curve (SWCC) {{is an important}} property of unsaturated soils. One key parameter of the SWCC is the air-entry value. For a soil that does not shrink as soil suction increases, the air-entry value is the same {{regardless of whether the}} gravimetric water content-based SWCC (SWCC-w), the volumetric water content-based SWCC (SWCC-θ) or the degree of saturation-based SWCC (SWCC-S) is used. However, for a soil that shrinks as soil suction increases, the air-entry value depends on the SWCC. The air-entry value determined from the SWCC-w is shown to underestimate the air-entry value for a soil that shows shrinkage as soil suction increases. For such cases, the SWCC-S should be used to determine the air-entry value. The SWCC-S can be constructed using the SWCC-w and the shrinkage curve. The shrinkage curve provides the void ratio and the water content for calculating the degree of saturation which can then be used to transform the SWCC-w to the SWCC-S. The shrinkage curve can be easily constructed from the final volume measurement of a drying soil specimen, as shown in this paper. The sensitivity analyses performed on 40 soils showed that the minimum void ratio of the shrinkage <b>curve</b> (<b>ash)</b> has a very significant effect, while the curvature of the shrinkage curve (csh) has a negligible effect on the SWCC-S, and therefore, on the determination of the AEV. A procedure is proposed for determining the air-entry value of soils exhibiting shrinkage upon drying...|$|R
