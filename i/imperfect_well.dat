Wells spacing significantly affects to the key indicators of the field development such as the rate of liquid and gas recovery from the reservoir, completeness of oil sweep out from the producing formation, the hydrocarbons ultimate recovery factor, reservoir producing life {{and a number of other}} indicators of development. In view of applications in oilfield practice, in most cases technologically <b>imperfect</b> <b>well</b> patterns, particularly, in productive beds with geologically and physically complicated conditions (reservoir rock heterogeneity, low filtration properties of layers, high oil viscosity, low energy manifestations during reservoir development, and so on) leads to formation of “stagnant” oil and less drained areas undeveloped in the primary oil recovery method. The present scientific work is an attempt to prove that the right choice of wells spacing system can be excluded “stagnant” oil zone, left undrained zones during the primary field development method...|$|E
40|$|The {{sources of}} {{groundwater}} pollution in Turkey are identified, and pathways of contaminants to groundwater are first described. Then, {{the effects of}} groundwater quality on health in Turkey are evaluated. In general, sources of groundwater contamination fall into two main categories: natural and anthropogenic sources. Important sources of natural groundwater pollution in Turkey include geological formations, seawater intrusion, and geothermal fluid(s). The major sources of anthropogenic groundwater contamination are agricultural activities, mining waste, industrial waste, on-site septic tank systems, and pollution from <b>imperfect</b> <b>well</b> constructions. The analysis results revealed that natural contamination due to salt and gypsum are mostly found in Central and Mediterranean regions and arsenic in Aegean region. Geothermal fluids which contain fluoride poses a danger for skeleton, dental, and bone problems, especially {{in the areas of}} Denizli, Isparta, and AydIn. Discharges from surface water bodies contaminate groundwater by infiltration. Evidence of such contamination is found in Upper KIzIlIrmak basin, Gediz basin, and Büyük Melen river basin and some drinking water reservoirs in Istanbul. Additionally, seawater intrusion causes groundwater quality problems in coastal regions, especially in the Aegean coast. Industrial wastes are also polluting surface and groundwater in industrialized regions of Turkey. Deterioration of water quality as a result of fertilizers and pesticides is another major problem especially in the regions of Mediterranean, Aegean, Central Anatolia, and Marmara. Abandoned mercury mines in the western regions of Turkey, especially in Çanakkale, Izmir, Muǧla, Kütahya, and BalIkesir, cause serious groundwater quality problems. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|A {{previous}} study (1) on the thermomechanical behaviour of metal-filled Epoxies {{led us to}} conclude that the concept of the boundary interphase is a very useful tool for describing quantitatively the quality of adhesion between the matrix and the filler particles. It was shown that this interphase exists in reality and is an area between filler and matrix, which contains both areas of adsorption interaction in polymer surface layers into filler particles, as well as an area of mechanical imperfections. In the present paper, under the assumption that the interphase is homogeneous and isotropic, exhibiting perfect adhesion with both main phases, a theory was developed to describe the thermomechanical behaviour of this interphase. Thermal expansion coefficients and volume fraction of the interphase {{of a large number of}} composites were determined and the effect of various parameters, such as temperature, volume fraction of filler and particle size, were examined for specimens exhibiting <b>imperfect</b> as <b>well</b> as perfect adhesion between matrix and filler. © 1979 Dr. Dietrich Steinkopff Verlag...|$|R

40|$|The known {{properties}} of equivalence between four-dimensional variational (4 D-Var) data assimilation and the Kalman filter {{as well as}} the fixed-interval Kalman smoother point to particular optimal {{properties of}} 4 D-Var. In the linear context, the 4 D-Var solution is optimal, not only with respect to the model trajectory segment over the assimilation time interval, but also with respect to any model state at a single observation time level; in the batch processing (cycling 4 D-Var) method, the information in 4 D-Var is fully transferred from one batch to the next by the background term; 4 D-Var allows the processing of observations in subsets, while the final solution is optimal as all observations are processed simultaneously. These properties hold even for models that are <b>imperfect,</b> as <b>well</b> as not invertible. Various properties of equivalence of 4 D-Var to the Kalman filter and smoother result from these optimality properties of 4 D-Var. Further, we show that the fixed-lag Kalman smoother may also be constructed in an optimal way using a multiple batch-processing 4 D-Var approach. While error covariances are crucial for the equivalence, practical techniques for evaluating error covariances in the framework of cycling 4 D-Var are discussed...|$|R

For example, a firm’s inadequate ability to identify a pool of potential employee candidates or to provide them comprehensive firm- or job-specific information tends to worsen labor shortages, and an employee’s ex-ante incomplete knowledge of on-the-job training or education opportunities tends to increase ex-post turnover intentions.
