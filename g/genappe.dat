5|$|Napoleon, {{with the}} reserves, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army but found the {{position}} empty. The French pursued Wellington's retreating army to Waterloo; however, due to bad weather, mud {{and the head}} start that Napoleon's tardy advance had allowed Wellington, apart from a cavalry action at <b>Genappe,</b> there was no substantial engagement.|$|E
5|$|Later on, {{being told}} by his brother, Jerome, of some gossip overheard by a waiter between British {{officers}} at lunch at the 'King of Spain' inn in <b>Genappe</b> that the Prussians were to march over from Wavre, Napoleon declared that the Prussians would need at least two days to recover and would {{be dealt with by}} Grouchy. Surprisingly, Jerome's overheard gossip aside, the French commanders present at the pre-battle conference at Le Caillou had no information about the alarming proximity of the Prussians and did not suspect that Blücher's men would start erupting onto the field of battle in great numbers just five hours later.|$|E
25|$|Prince Waldeck {{had hoped}} to delay the {{campaign}} to enable the Elector of Brandenburg to move on the Moselle and tie down Boufflers, but Luxembourg’s early manoeuvres had allowed Boufflers to move between the rivers Sambre and Meuse to support the French commander. Waldeck, meanwhile, left his assembly point at Tienen (Tirlemont) and advanced to Wavre. After dispersing his troops to live off forage, the Allied army reassembled and advanced to <b>Genappe</b> on 8 June.|$|E
60|$|After this, {{by special}} invitation, he journeyed {{to the camp}} of the Duke of Marlborough at <b>Genappes,</b> where he was {{received}} with much honor by the great commander. He presented to him his two aides de camp.|$|R

"To an {{ambassador}} of another nation," [...] he said, [...] "I would have thrown something of state into our reception; but {{to an old}} friend, who often shared my board at the Castle of <b>Genappes</b> [during his residence in Burgundy, in his father's lifetime, <b>Genappes</b> was the usual abode of Louis.... S.], I wished to show myself, as I love best to live, old Louis of Valois, as simple and plain as any of his Parisian badauds [idlers]. But I directed them to make some better cheer than ordinary for you, Sir Count, for I know your Burgundian proverb, 'Mieux vault bon repas que bel habit' [a good meal {{is better than a}} beautiful coat. (Present spelling is vaut.)]; and therefore I bid them have some care of our table. For our wine, you know well it is the subject of an old emulation betwixt France and Burgundy, which we will presently reconcile; for I will drink to you in Burgundy, and you, Sir Count, shall pledge me in Champagne.--Here, Oliver, let me have a cup of Vin d'Auxerre;" [...] and he hummed gaily a song then well known, ...|$|R
25|$|Waldeck {{eventually}} retired on Brussels {{where his}} injured troops were replaced with men from fortress garrisons. Spanish troops under the Marquis of Gastañaga joined the main Allied army, {{as did the}} Count of Tilly with troops from Liège and Brandenburg on 22 July. On 2 August, the Elector of Brandenburg’s forces combined with Waldeck whose Allied army now numbered 55,000 men. With this force, the Allied army marched to <b>Genappe,</b> proceeding on to Nivelles on 7 August.|$|E
500|$|As dusk fell, both squares withdrew in {{relatively}} good order, but the French artillery {{and everything else}} fell {{into the hands of}} the Prussian and Anglo-allied armies. The retreating Guards were surrounded by thousands of fleeing, broken French troops. Coalition cavalry harried the fugitives until about 23:00, with Gneisenau pursuing them as far as <b>Genappe</b> before ordering a halt. There, Napoleon's abandoned carriage was captured, still containing [...] of Machiavelli's The Prince, and diamonds left behind in the rush to escape. These diamonds became part of King Friedrich Wilhelm of Prussia's crown jewels; one Major Keller of the F/15th received the Pour le Mérite with oak leaves for the feat. By this time 78guns and 2,000prisoners had also been taken, including more generals.|$|E
500|$|A {{monument}} to the Prussian dead {{is located in the}} village of Plancenoit on the site where one of their artillery batteries took position. The Duhesme mausoleum is one among the few graves of the fallen. It is located at the side of Saint Martin's Church in Ways, a hamlet in the municipality of <b>Genappe.</b> Seventeen fallen officers are buried in the crypt of the British Monument in the Brussels Cemetery in Evere. The remains of a 23-year-old soldier named Friederich Brandt were discovered in 2012. He was a slightly hunchbacked infantryman, [...] tall, and was hit in the chest by a French bullet. His rifle, coins, and position on the battlefield identified him as an Hanoverian fighting in the King's German Legion.|$|E
2500|$|Wellington {{anticipated}} that Napoleon would then come against him at Quatre Bras, so he spent 17 June [...] to a defensive position he had personally reconnoitred {{the previous year}} at Mont-Saint-Jean a low ridge south of the village of Waterloo and the Forest of Soignes. Napoleon, with the reserve and {{the right wing of}} the Army of the North, made a late start on 17 June and joined Ney at Quatre Bras at 13:00 to attack Wellington's army, but found only the rearguard of cavalry remaining on the site. The French pursued Wellington to Waterloo, fighting a small cavalry action at <b>Genappe</b> before torrential rain set in for the night. By the end of 17 June, Wellington's army had arrived at its position at Waterloo, with the main body of Napoleon's army following. It was at the Battle of Waterloo on 18 June 1815 that the decisive battle of the campaign took place.|$|E

6000|$|... "We earnestly beg you, Sire, to {{come with}} us to <b>Genappe.</b> There is not the {{slightest}} hope of rallying any portion of your army now. The Prussians are on us. You might fall into their hands." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{saw that}} on the wide road which leads to <b>Genappe</b> and Charleroi the once invincible cavalry of the mighty Emperor was fleeing helter-skelter {{from the scene of}} its disaster: he saw that the British--what was left of them--were in hot pursuit! He saw from far Plancenoit the scintillating casques of Blücher's Prussians.|$|E
60|$|It {{was close}} on half-past nine {{and the moon}} full up on the stormy sky when a couple of riders {{detached}} themselves out of the surging mass of horses and men that were flying pell-mell towards <b>Genappe,</b> and slightly checking their horses, put them to a slower gallop and finally to a trot.|$|E
6000|$|... "De Marmont," [...] {{he calls}} to his {{faithful}} friend, [...] "De Marmont, go ride to Paris now; {{tell them that}} victory is ours! No, no," [...] he adds excitedly, [...] "don't go all the way--ride to <b>Genappe</b> and send a messenger to Paris from there--then come back {{to be with us}} in the hour of victory." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{arrival of}} M. le Comte de Cambray, {{accompanied}} by a doctor and two men carrying an improvised stretcher, broke the spell of silence that had fallen on this strange scene of pathetic failure which seemed but an humble counterpart of that great and irretrievable one which was being enacted at this same hour far away {{on the road to}} <b>Genappe.</b>|$|E
6000|$|As my {{divisions}} seem to lie around [...] The probable {{point of}} impact, it behoves me [...] To start at once, Duke, for <b>Genappe,</b> I deem? [...] Being in Brussels, {{all for this}} damned ball, [...] The dispositions out there have, so far, [...] Been made by young Saxe Weimar and Perponcher, [...] On their own judgment quite. I go, your Grace? ...|$|E
60|$|The {{artillery}} fire ceased in front before the column continued its march for Mount St. Jean. The Prince of Orange had paused in his advance {{when he saw}} how strong was the French force round Frasnes, and Ney was {{not yet ready to}} attack. Therefore from eleven until two there was a cessation of operations, and the ardor of the troops flagged somewhat as they tramped along the dusty road between Mount St. Jean and <b>Genappe.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Suppose the Duke of Wellington's words {{should prove}} to be correct, and the French army should be driven in utter rout from the field, the Emperor will {{certainly}} take the road back through <b>Genappe</b> and Charleroi as being the shortest to the frontier. We can imagine that his horses will be fleet, and that the fugitives will make way for him. Our cavalry will follow {{the rear of the}} beaten army, but the Emperor will be far away {{at the front of the}} throng." ...|$|E
6000|$|Day's nether hours advance; storm supervenes [...] In {{heaviness}} unparalleled, that screens [...] With water-woven gauzes, vapour-bred, [...] The creeping {{clumps of}} half-obliterate red-- [...] Severely harassed past each round and ridge [...] By the inimical lance. They gain the bridge [...] And village of <b>Genappe,</b> in equal fence [...] With {{weather and the}} enemy's violence. [...] --Cannon upon the foul and flooded road, [...] Cavalry in the cornfields mire-bestrowed, [...] With frothy horses floundering to their knees, [...] Make wayfaring a moil of miseries! [...] Till Britishry and Bonapartists lose [...] Their clashing colours for the tawny hues [...] That twilight sets on all its stealing tinct imbues.|$|E
60|$|Behind this {{screen of}} brave men the others took their breath, {{and then went}} on in less desperate fashion. They had broken away from the road, and all over the {{countryside}} in the twilight I could see the timid, scattered, frightened crowd who ten hours before had formed the finest army that ever went down to battle. I with my splendid mare was soon able to get clear of the throng, and just after I passed <b>Genappe</b> I overtook the Emperor with the remains of his Staff. Soult was with him still, and so were Drouot, Lobau, and Bertrand, with five Chasseurs of the Guard, their horses hardly able to move.|$|E
60|$|Until {{far into}} the night the air reverberated with incessant cannonade--from the {{direction}} of <b>Genappe</b> and from that of Wavre--but just before dawn all was still. The stream of convoys which bore the wounded {{along the road to}} Brussels from Mont Saint Jean and Hougoumont and La Haye Sainte had momentarily ceased its endless course. The sky had that perfect serenity of a midsummer's night, starlit and azure with the honey-coloured moon sinking slowly down towards the west. Here {{at the edge of the}} wood the air had a sweet smell of wet earth and damp moss and freshly cut hay: it had all the delicious softness of a loved one's embrace.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are impatient, Prince," [...] {{said the}} Emperor almost gaily, as he strode {{with a firm}} step to the door. [...] "You are afraid those cursed Prussians will put the Corsican ogre into a cage and send him at once to His Victorious Bourbon Majesty King Louis XVIII. Not so, my good Berthier, not so. The Star of my Destiny has not yet declined. I've done all the {{thinking}} I wanted to do. Now we'll to <b>Genappe,</b> where we'll rally the remnants of our army and then quietly await de Marmont's return with the millions which we want. After that we'll boldly on to Paris and defy my enemies there [...] . . . En avant, Maréchal! the Corsican ogre {{is not in the}} iron cage yet!" ...|$|E
