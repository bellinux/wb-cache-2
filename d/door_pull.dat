50|$|The Business was {{introduced}} in July 1953, in four-door sedan form only, as a better equipped version of the basic Holden 48-215 series sedan introduced in 1948 and was specifically aimed at the taxi market. Improvements included passenger grab rails, <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handles, seat kick plates, heavy-duty seats, floor mats, a heavy-duty battery and a boot lid handle. The Business Sedan was officially designated as model 48-215-257. Like the basic Holden sedan, it was powered by a 132.5 cubic inch six cylinder engine.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} obvious {{radiator}} grill and bumper bar changes, {{there were other}} less obvious changes that {{took place during the}} Midgets production run. The first cars assembled in 1967 were wired positive earth, had thinly cast engine blocks requiring nitrated crank shafts to provide extra rigidity. Later engines blocks were cast with thicker walls. Other changes were to negative earth wiring and alternator, chunckier boot lock handle, internal door latch handles, and quarter light window handles. Plastic window winder and internal <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handles. Crossflow radiators running at higher pressures. The differential ratio was also changed to 3.9 some time during 1970.|$|E

5000|$|An unusual {{interior}} change {{placed the}} power window switches {{flat against the}} door panel, whereas the window switches for the first generation and third generation extended from the door panels and were oriented in a horizontal position and were located underneath the drivers or occupants hands for easy location and use, and integrated into the <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> and armrest. The express up feature for the driver's window was also removed, leaving express down only. The power door lock switch design was upgraded to a more conventional door lock switch, installed next to the power window switches, with a secondary power lock switch installed for the front passenger. This approach was also used on the 1990-1993 Honda Integra ...|$|E
50|$|The 1968 Imperial {{was little}} {{changed from the}} {{previous}} year. The grille changed to a brightly chromed one with thin horizontal bars, split in the middle by vertical chrome and a round Imperial Eagle badge. The cornering lamp lenses were now covered by matching grilles. At the rear, the horizontal bars over the taillights remained, but the gas filler <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> was changed to a cast metal eagle instead of a round knob containing a plastic emblem. All 1968s came with a Federally mandated energy absorbing steering column. The base level model was cancelled after only one year and the four-door sedan {{became part of the}} Crown level of trim. This was also the last year for the Imperial convertible. A total of 15,367 Imperials were sold in 1968.|$|E

Other standard STS features (these were options on the standard Seville) were: automatic door locks, illuminated driver and passenger side visor vanity mirrors, illuminated entry system, rear window defogger, theft-deterrent system and trunk mat.|$|E
5000|$|Chevrolet marketed {{optional}} [...] "Rally" [...] and [...] "Woody" [...] packages {{as well as}} {{the least}} expensive [...] "Scooter" [...] model. The Rally 1.6 included a 1.6-liter (98 cu in) engine in lieu of the 1.4-liter (85 cu in) overhead-cam four-cylinder, rated at [...] instead of , along with a rear stabilizer and special body graphics. The Chevette Woody (1976) featured simulated wood grain siding and upgraded interior and exterior trim. The Scooter was offered as a base model with a $2,899 suggested retail price, two front passenger seats, an optional rear seat, deletion of most exterior chrome (e.g., window surrounds), painted rather than chrome bumpers, an open glove box, black carpeting, <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> straps in lieu of arm rests, fiberboard door panels, and a passenger seat without fore-aft adjustment. A total of 9,810 Scooters were manufactured, compared to 178,007 regular hatchbacks.|$|E
50|$|New Zealand {{importer}} and CKD assembler Todd Motors {{also created}} {{its own unique}} versions of the Arrow line. The single 1967 launch version (1725 cc aluminium head engine with four-speed manual transmission or three-speed Borg Warner 35 automatic transmission with twin front seats) was almost identical to its UK counterpart but Todd started to use its own upholstery designs from the 1969 rectangular headlight update. For 1970, it added a silver rear trim panel and a 'by Chrysler' boot lid badge to the Hunter saloon and introduced the estate although this had a lower specification than the saloon - an iron head 1725 cc engine, no automatic option, simpler dashboard trim (no locking glovebox), interior <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handles instead of armrests (sedans had them on the three passenger doors), painted rather than bright metal door window frame trim and fixed rather than opening front quarter-lights.|$|E

50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the interior was largely designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau http://www.poltronafrau.com/portal/page/portal/UI/webpages/poltronafrau/home?lang=en of Italy, whom they had previously worked with on the larger Q45. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement from the larger Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handle.|$|E
5000|$|... 1988 was {{met with}} an {{extensive}} restyle, and sales nearly doubled from the previous year, up to 33,210. While the wheelbase, doors, roof, and glass remained relatively unchanged, new body panels gave the 1988 model a more identifiable [...] "Eldorado" [...] appearance. Now available in just 17 exterior colors (previously 19), the new Eldorado was 3" [...] longer than last year. Underneath the restyled hood was Cadillac's new 155 horsepower 4.5 liter V8. A comprehensive anti-lock braking system, developed by Teves, was newly available. Longer front fenders held [...] "bladed" [...] tips, and a new grille above the revamped front bumper. In back, new three-sided tail lamps - reminiscent of the 1987 Deville - appeared along with a new bumper and trunk lid. Bladed 14" [...] aluminum wheels remained standard, while an optional 15" [...] snowflake-pattern alloy wheel was included with the Touring Suspension option. The interior held wider front seat headrests and swing-away <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handles (replacing the former <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> straps). New upholstery patterns, along with shoulder belts for outboard rear-seat passengers, appeared for both base and Biarritz models, with the latter bringing back the tufted-button design - last seen in the 1985 Eldorado Biarritz. A new vinyl roof option, covering the full roof top, featured a band of body color above the side door and windows - similar to the style used until 1978. This replaced the [...] "cabriolet roof" [...] option, which covered the rear half of the roof, introduced just a year earlier. With the Biarritz option package, the padded vinyl roof covered just the rear quarter of the roof top, behind the rear side windows. Biarritz also included slender vertical opera lamps, as in 1986 and '87, but now added a spear molding (similar to the style used on the 1976 - 1985 Eldorado Biarritz) that ran {{from the base of}} the roof top, continuing horizontally along the door, and down to the front fender tip. The standard power antenna was moved from the front passenger fender to the rear passenger fender. Pricing went up this year - to $24,891. This 1988 restyle would be the last, until the model was replaced by an all-new Eldorado for 1992.|$|E
5000|$|Darts {{were offered}} to the taxicab {{industry}} for their whole production run from 1963 to 1976. While specifications varied by year, interior upgrades generally included heavy-duty front and rear black rubber floor mats, heavy-duty seat cushion springs with full foam back and air-foam seats, black all-vinyl trim with heavy canvas-backed vinyl seat covers, interior <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> assist straps or handles, and a door-ajar warning light for the driver. Mechanically, Dart taxicabs were generally equipped with heavy-duty brakes, tires, shock absorbers, front torsion bars and rear leaf springs, a high-output alternator, an increased-capacity cooling system and extra-lean carburetor calibration for greater economy. In 1976, the Chrome Yellow taxi package was available only with a 225 slant-six engine producing [...] and 170 lbft Nm; transmission was the (rare) A-727-RG (raised-deck motor, which was the slant-six series) with California emissions, [...] and 165 lbft Nm. Options included a radio suppression package and a Fuel Pacer System. Many—if not all—of them had a body color paint sales code of [...] "999", meaning special order paint ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1967 Jimi Hendrix {{played at}} the Troutbeck Hotel, now a nursing home, {{although}} the show was cut short by the police.

50|$|It was {{reported}} that during the sinking 2nd Officer Lightoller ordered crew members to open the port side gangway doors on D-Deck for loading more passengers into the lifeboats nearer to sea level.

5000|$|With bigger changes {{coming in}} 1980, the 1979 models saw few alterations, which {{included}} a new lightweight aluminum hood and a new grille design with [...] "Cadillac" [...] script on the header above the grille. The [...] "Phaeton" [...] package, now priced at $2,029, was still available in three colors, but with two new replacement colors: [...] "Western Saddle Firemist" [...] (with leather interior in [...] "Antique Saddle") replacing the [...] "Arizona Beige", and [...] "Slate Firemist" [...] (with leather interior in [...] "Antique Gray") replacing [...] "Platinum Silver". The d'Elegance package was back, at $725, which included Venetian velour upholstery (in four colors) with a 50/50 split front seat, overhead assist handles, Tangier carpeting, <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handles, and [...] "d'Elegance" [...] emblems among other niceties. In addition to the $783 [...] "fuel-injection" [...] option, {{there was also the}} choice of a 350 in3 LF9 diesel V8 (built by Oldsmobile) for $849. Coupe de Ville's cabriolet package, priced at $384, was available in 17 colors. Production rose slightly to 121,890 for Coupe de Ville ($11,728), and 93,211 for Sedan de Ville ($12,093).|$|E
50|$|To {{establish}} {{that this was}} a luxury vehicle, the plush leather interior was designed with assistance from Poltrona Frau of Italy. The seats were made by Poltrona Frau at a rate of only five a day. The interior treatment continued to use the contrasting arrangement used in the larger Nissan Infiniti Q45 with a dark color used for the dashboard, and center console, with a lighter shade color used inside for the seats, interior door panels, headliner, carpet, and carpeted floor mats. The driver's side window controls had an unusual placement in that the drivers window switch was both one-touch express down and double-sized, meaning it was the same width as two conventional window switches towards the top, with the front and rear passenger window switches further down, with the window lockout switch installed next to the front passenger switch, instead of the drivers window switch. The front passenger and rear passenger window switches were thumb activated, installed {{at the top of the}} interior <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handle. This version of the Leopard was the first car sold in Japan to include a passenger-side airbag as standard equipment.|$|E
50|$|It was {{equipped}} with ergonomically designed and located window switch {{on the top of}} the <b>door</b> <b>pull</b> handle operated by the drivers thumb, and the instrument lighting being much more noticeable at night than during the day, using a reverse effect of white light on the gauges with black numbers. The Q45's use of a Cloisonné insignia instead of a conventional grille also caused buyers to shy away because of its unconventional, bottom breather appearance, and may have been influenced from the first generation Ford Taurus, the 1994 model year update featured a more conventional appearance including a more traditional appearing grille, woodgrain/chrome interior trim and cushy seats, drawing influences from the Nissan Maxima. More sedate performance figures, slower 17:1 steering (except on the Q45t, which retained the original 15.1:1 ratio), lower ratio 1st and 2nd gears, and a dynamically smooth suspension were all added in 1993 to make it a more status-quo luxury sedan. Other changes include thicker glass, keyless remote, auto-dim rear-view mirror, dipping side view mirrors, an improved transmission heat exchanger and external ATF filter, new oval intake ports and revised disc injectors, and fog lights. Metal-backed camshaft timing chain guides were added in 1993 to replace the earlier model's less reliable plastic guides.|$|E
