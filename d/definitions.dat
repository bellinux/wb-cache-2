5|$|At its 23rd meeting, held in 2007, the CGPM {{recommended}} that the CIPM should continue to investigate methods to provide exact fixed values for physical constants of nature that could then {{be used in the}} <b>definitions</b> of units of measure in place of the IPK, thus enabling the transition from explicit unit <b>definitions</b> to explicit constant <b>definitions.</b>|$|E

5|$|As John Wilson {{and others}} have noted, it is {{difficult}} to define leisure. Its <b>definitions</b> are numerous and often mutually contradictory, for example as a discrete portion of one's time or as a quality of experience irrespective of time. Joffre Dumazedier distinguished four distinct <b>definitions</b> of leisure, which begin broadly and gradually narrow in scope. The first and broadest defines leisure as a style of behavior that may occur even at work, the second defines it as any non-work activity; the third further excludes family and household obligations; and, finally, the narrowest defines leisure as activities dedicated to self-fulfillment. Dumazedier's four <b>definitions</b> are not exhaustive. Incompatible <b>definitions</b> and measures are seen as a major factor accounting for occasionally contradictory research findings.|$|E

5|$|Boris and Zeanah (1999), {{have offered}} an {{approach}} to attachment disorders that considers cases where children have had no opportunity to form an attachment, those {{where there is a}} distorted relationship, and those where an existing attachment has been abruptly disrupted. This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR <b>definitions</b> because those <b>definitions</b> are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a specified attachment figure.|$|E

5|$|Density {{criteria}} {{range from}} above 3.5g/cm3 to above 7g/cm3. Atomic weight <b>definitions</b> {{can range from}} greater than sodium (atomic weight 22.98); greater than 40 (excluding s- and f-block metals, hence starting with scandium); or more than 200, i.e. from mercury onwards. Atomic numbers of heavy metals are generally given as greater than 20 (calcium); sometimes this is capped at 92 (uranium). <b>Definitions</b> based on atomic number have been criticised for including metals with low densities. For example, rubidium in group (column) 1 of the periodic table has an atomic number of 37 but a density of only 1.532g/cm3, which is below the threshold figure used by other authors. The same problem may occur with atomic weight based <b>definitions.</b>|$|E
