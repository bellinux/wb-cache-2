40|$|At present, {{competition}} and the latest network technologies threaten the profit margins of telecommunications providers. New services, however, represent an important prospect for increased revenue. To capitalize on this opportunity, new services must appeal to users and be capable of rapid introduction and scaling to meet demand. Moreover, cost-effective service introduction requires independence from the underlying access technology. This paper discusses today's service delivery methodology and introduces the theme of service-centric networks - the uncoupling of services from access networks.

40|$|We present our {{experiences}} with the DSC (Distributed Software Component) framework and development environment. The DSC framework supports component oriented distributed communication architecture such as TINA (<b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Information</b> Network <b>Architecture).</b> Within the component development environment, components can be developed and evaluated. Software components are self-contained packages of code that can be dynamically linked into a program. Operational interfaces cater for the external functionality of the component. The DSC can support both dynamic and static operational interfaces. Also, there can exist multiple instances of the same operational interface. Furthermore, components can be grouped together to form compound components. Through a common control and configuration interface the components can be configured with regard to events, properties, operational interfaces, life cycle, and composition. We apply this framework to a TINA based service and network architecture called MESH (Multimedia Services on the Electronic Super Highway). An example is provided; a shared white board service is created using the DSC framework. The shared white board service {{can be used in}} multimedia conferencing applications...|$|R
40|$|Service {{architectures}} {{are necessary}} for providing value-added services in telecommunications networks, including those in medical institutions. Separation of service logic and control from the actual call switching is the main idea of these service architectures, examples include Intelligent Network (IN), <b>Telecommunications</b> <b>Information</b> Network <b>Architectures</b> (TINA), and Open Service Access (OSA). In the Distributed Service Architectures (DSA), instances of the same object type can be placed on different physical nodes. Hence, the network performance can be enhanced by introducing load balancing algorithms to efficiently distribute the traffic between object instances, such that the overall throughput and network performance can be optimised. In this paper, we propose a new load balancing algorithm called "Node Status Algorithm" for DSA infrastructure applicable to electronic-based medical institutions. The simulation results illustrate that this proposed algorithm is able to outperform the benchmark load balancing algorithms-Random Algorithm and Shortest Queue Algorithm, especially under medium and heavily loaded network conditions, which are typical of the increasing bandwidth utilization and processing requirements at paperless hospitals and in the telemedicine environment...|$|R
