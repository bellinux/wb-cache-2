50|$|A famous {{network of}} {{conditional}} proofs is the NP-complete class of complexity theory. There {{are a large}} number of interesting tasks, and while it is not known if a polynomial-time solution <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> any of them, it is known that if such a solution <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> any of them, one <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> all of them. Similarly, the Riemann hypothesis has {{a large number of}} consequences already proven.|$|R

5|$|Once formed, {{proteins}} only <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> {{a certain}} period of time and are then degraded and recycled by the cell's machinery through the process of protein turnover. A protein's lifespan is measured in terms of its half-life and covers a wide range. They can <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> minutes or years with an average lifespan of 1–2 days in mammalian cells. Abnormal or misfolded proteins are degraded more rapidly either due to being targeted for destruction or due to being unstable.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium forms {{a variety}} of {{coordination}} complexes. Examples are the many pentammine derivatives n+ that often <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> both Ru(II) and Ru(III). Derivatives of bipyridine and terpyridine are numerous, best known being the luminescent tris(bipyridine)ruthenium(II) chloride.|$|E
5|$|Associations {{with various}} climate and {{environmental}} trends <b>exist.</b> <b>For</b> example, {{an increase in}} the sea surface temperature of a source region (e.g. Gulf of Mexico and Mediterranean Sea) increases atmospheric moisture content. Increased moisture can fuel an increase in severe weather and tornado activity, particularly in the cool season.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{standards}} that <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> paper checks {{also apply to}} Image Replacement Documents. These standards include ANSX9.100-160-2 (Magnetic Ink Printing (MICR) Part 2 External Processing Code (EPC) Field Use), ANSX9.100-181 (Specifications for TIFF Image Format for Image Exchange), ANSX9.100-187 (Specifications for Electronic Exchange of Check and Image Data - Domestic), and Draft Standard for Trial Use (DSTU)X9.37 (Electronic Exchange of Check and Image Data).|$|E
5|$|Facilities also <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> {{cross-country}} skiing, {{including a}} long stretch of the old railway line. In and around Cortina, there are opportunities to participate in many other winter sports such as curling, ski mountaineering, snowboarding, sledding and extreme skiing. In the summer months, sports include trekking, biking, rock climbing, tennis, golf, swimming and ice skiing.|$|E
5|$|First {{described}} in 1927 by the West Australian botanist Charles Gardner, the species {{was at one}} stage considered a variety of B.sphaerocarpa. Although there are no recognised subspecies or varieties, both lignotuberous and nonlignotuberous forms <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> Banksia violacea. Wasps, ants and flies have been recorded visiting flower spikes. Banksia violacea is classified as Not Threatened under the Wildlife Conservation Act of Western Australia. Regarded as of little value to floriculture, it is rarely cultivated.|$|E

5|$|Formal {{criteria}} <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> each of {{the main}} subtypes of Guillain–Barré syndrome (AIDP and AMAN/AMSAN, see below), but these may misclassify some cases (particularly where there is reversible conduction failure) and therefore changes to these criteria have been proposed. Sometimes, repeated testing may be helpful.|$|E
5|$|Glucocorticoids {{have been}} found to be as {{effective}} as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5|$|Multiple {{standards}} <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> defining Henoch–Schönlein purpura, {{including the}} 1990 American College of Rheumatology (ACR) classification and the 1994 Chapel Hill Consensus Conference (CHCC). Some have reported the ACR criteria {{to be more}} sensitive than those of the CHCC.|$|E
60|$|Well, this, I take it, is the {{absolute}} degradation of education. It is a modern error that education <b>exists</b> <b>for</b> the individual.

5|$|Organometallic {{compounds}} {{by definition}} contain {{at least one}} carbon-metal bond. A wide range of such compounds exist; major classes include simple alkyl-metal compounds (for example, tetraethyllead), η-alkene compounds (for example, Zeise's salt), and η-allyl compounds (for example, allylpalladium chloride dimer); metallocenes containing cyclopentadienyl ligands (for example, ferrocene); and transition metal carbene complexes. Many metal carbonyls <b>exist</b> (<b>for</b> example, tetracarbonylnickel); some workers consider the carbon monoxide ligand to be purely inorganic, and not organometallic.|$|E
5|$|Other methods also <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> {{describing}} polygonal tilings. When the tessellation is made {{of regular}} polygons, the most common notation is the vertex configuration, which is simply {{a list of the}} number of sides of the polygons around a vertex. The square tiling has a vertex configuration of 4.4.4.4, or 44. The tiling of regular hexagons is noted 6.6.6, or 63.|$|E
5|$|Parish records <b>exist</b> <b>for</b> Navenby from 1681, {{although}} bishops' transcripts {{go back to}} 1562.
