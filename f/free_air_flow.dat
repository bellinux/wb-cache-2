40|$|Evaporation is an {{important}} component of the soil water balance. It is composed of water flow and transport processes in a porous medium that are coupled with heat fluxes and <b>free</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow.</b> This work provides a comprehensive review of model concepts used in different research fields to describe evaporation. Concepts range from nonisothermal two-phase flow, two-component transport in the porous medium that is coupled with one-phase flow, two-component transport in the <b>free</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> to isothermal liquid water flow in the porous medium with upper boundary conditions defined by a potential evaporation flux when available energy and transfer to the free airflow are limiting or by a critical threshold water pressure when soil water availability is limiting. The latter approach corresponds with the classical Richards equation with mixed boundary conditions. We compare the different approaches on a theoretical level by identifying the underlying simplifications that are made for the different compartments of the system: porous medium, free flow and their interface, and by discussing how processes not explicitly considered are parameterized. Simplifications can be grouped into three sets depending on whether lateral variations in vertical fluxes are considered, whether flow and transport in the air phase in the porous medium are considered, and depending on how the interaction at the interface between the free flow and the porous medium is represented. The consequences of the simplifications are illustrated by numerical simulations in an accompanying paper...|$|E
40|$|Evaporation {{from the}} soil surface {{represents}} a water flow and transport process in a porous medium that is coupled with a <b>free</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> and with heat fluxes in the system. We give an overview of different model concepts {{that are used to}} describe this process. These range from non-isothermal two-phase flow two-component transport in the porous medium that is coupled with one-phase flow two-component transport in the free air to isothermal water flow in the porous with upper boundary conditions defined by a potential evaporation flux when available energy and transfer to the <b>free</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> are limiting or by a critical threshold water pressure when soil water availability is limiting. The latter approach corresponds with the classical Richards equation with mixed boundary conditions. We formulated the different equations and identified assumptions behind simplified forms. Conditions for which lateral and up and downward air flow in the porous medium and vapor diffusion in the pore space play an important role were identified using simulations for a set of scenarios. When comparing cumulative evaporation fluxes from initially wet soil profiles, only small differences between the different models were found. The effect of vapor flow in the porous medium on cumulative evaporation could be evaluated using the desorptivity, Sevap, which represents a weighted average of liquid and vapor diffusivity over the range of soil water contents between the soil surface water content and the initial soil water content. Vapor flow influences the shape of the moisture front close to the soil surface. Simulated evaporation fluxes under dynamic forcing, e. g. due to diurnal variations in net radiation, differed considerably between the models. Experimental methods that allow monitoring of diurnal evaporation fluxes are therefore essential for model discrimination and parameterization...|$|E

40|$|Background: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} the Baska Mask®, a new extraglottic airway device (EAD) for use in anesthesia in adult patients undergoing a variety of surgical interventions. Materials and Methods: The self-recoiling membrane distally open cuff silicone mask consists of an anatomically curved airway tube with: (1) a bite block over the full length of the airway; (2) a self-sealing membranous variable-pressure cuff which adjusts to the contours of the mouth and pharynx; (3) a large sump cavity with two aspiratable gastric drain tubes; together with a number of special features such as (4) a tab for manually curving the mask to ease insertion; and (5) a suction elbow integral to one port with a second port acting as a <b>free</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> access. The cuff of the Baska Mask® is not an inflatable balloon, but a membrane which inflates on every breath during intermittent positive pressure ventilation (IPPV) to achieve a superior seal when opposed to the larynx. An increase in IPPV pressure increases the oropharyngeal seal. With existing extraglottic airway devices, an increase in IPPV merely increases the leak. Results: Fifty patients with American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) physical status I-III were enrolled. We evaluated the "first attempt" and "overall insertion" success rates, insertion time, ease of insertion and removal of the device, oropharyngeal leak pressure, and anatomical position at fiberoptic view. The "first attempt" success rate was high (88 %) and "overall insertion" success rates was considered "easy" to "very easy" by the operators in 92 % of patients. Removal of the device was considered easy in all cases. The oropharyngeal leak pressure was above 30 cm H 2 O in all patients and the maximum of 40 cm H 2 O was achieved in 82 % of the patients. In two patients, no adequate capnogram was obtained, so a smaller size mask was inserted with correction to adequate function. At fiberoptic evaluation of the anatomical position of the masks, the vocal cords could be seen, except in six patients (12 %), where only the epiglottis could be visualized.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{temperature and humidity}} differentiation in the Adam Mickiewicz University (AMU) Botanical Garden in Poznań in comparison to a professional meteorological station, which is 3. 5 k m away in the straight line. The conclusions make us change the methodology of taking measurements in park-andforest areas, which are botanical gardens, in comparison to standard climatic stations. The changes of atmosphere parameters caused by plants rely on: 1. The active surface, i. e. the surface on which light radiation is converted into thermal energy is the upper layer of tree and bush heads. This means shading under the heads and reducing the flow of solar energy to the ground surface. As a result, maximum temperatures are lowered at daytime (the largest amounts of heat are trapped in their heads), whereas at night, recorded minimum temperatures are higher in comparison to open areas: the foliage partially reflects long-wave radiation of the Earth. This effect mitigates daily temperature amplitudes in solid plant complexes. 2. Increased water supply from évapotranspiration processes, i. e. evaporation {{from the surface of}} the soil, watercourses, ponds, and its transpiration by plants result in higher air humidity. A larger amount of water vapor means a lower shortage of atmosphere humidity. This slows down unproductive plant evaporation in favor of productive transpiration. 3. Filling the space with trees, bushes, climbing plants, cover plants, etc. is a considerable obstacle for the wind, thus decreasing its strength. A s a result, instead of a <b>free</b> <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> taking moisture particles, natural obstacles decrease wind velocity within the plant complex and force its turbulence. This results in a longer stay of the humid air mass in the area of the garden, and therefore, lower sucking force of the atmosphere depending on wind velocity, in respect to humidity. 4. While raining, the moistened surface is unproportionally larger (up to over 10 times) than the area; this is the leaf surface of subsequent plant floors. After raining, evaporation from such a large surface results in higher air humidity, in comparison to the area without trees. Simultaneously, due to decreasing wind power, water vapor saturation of air after rains is maintained longer in comparison to observations in other areas, including the climatic station of the Meteorological Institute (IMGW...|$|E

40|$|The {{increased}} electrical currents used {{to drive}} light emitting diode (LED) cause significant heat generation in the solid state lighting (SSL) system. As the temperature will directly affect the maximum light output, quality, reliability and the life time of the SSL system, thermal management is a key design aspect in terms of cost and performance. Particularly for consumer SSL system, natural convection cooling is cheaper and more reliable than the forced air cooling heat sinks. Although with less efficiency, natural convection heat sink is a good compromise between economy and thermal performance of SSL systems. In this work, the thermal performance of two geometrically different passive heat sink designs for consumer SSL applications is numerically simulated. The heat sink performance is simulated for two orientations: LED up and LED down orientation. Simulation runs for the two designs at the two orientations, in order to investigate the thermal performance of the heat sinks with natural convection cooling. Meanwhile, the radiation effect is considered. With passive cooling, the natural convection plays an important role, and results show that if <b>free</b> ambient <b>air</b> <b>flow</b> is blocked by the heat sink design and the performance reduces considerably. Furthermore, the volume of <b>free</b> <b>air</b> in the luminaire {{is expected to have}} significant impact to the heat sink thermal performance. Therefore, the thermal performance for different volumes of luminaire enclosures is also investigated in this work. To analyze the modeling results, a straightforward calculation of the thermal resistance between the LED junction and the environment is applied. In the results, the thermal resistances of LED junction to environment decreases but the air velocity gradually increases with the increasing luminaire volume. In conclusion, although more study is needed for validation of the optimal volume and shape for natural convection, the results in this work can already be used to guide the design of luminaires. In future work, the simulation on real model of bulb or luminaires will be applied to investigate what extend designs based on natural convection and radiation principles can be exploited to manage the LED junction temperature. © 2011 IEEE...|$|R
