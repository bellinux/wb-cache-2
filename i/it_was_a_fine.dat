500|$|In a {{professional}} capacity, Galland spoke fluent Spanish which eased his instruction on new pilots. During {{his time with}} the Argentine Air Force (FAA) he flew the British Gloster Meteor. Galland commented, mindful it was a contemporary to the Me 262, that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> aircraft. He claimed {{that if he could}} have fitted the Meteor engines to the Me 262 airframe he would have had the best fighter in the world. Galland continued training, lecturing and consulting for the FAA until 1955. [...] During his later years in Argentina Galland returned to Europe to test fly new types. While there, he teamed up with Eduard Neumann, the former Geschwaderkommodore of Jagdgeschwader 27 and mentor of Hans-Joachim Marseille [...] "The Star of Africa". Neumann had joined Galland's staff in April 1943. They flew a Piaggio P.149 in an international air rally across Italy. The weather was appalling and seven aircraft crashed taking two lives. Galland and Neumann came in second place.|$|E
500|$|In the 1910 {{domestic}} season Rhodes {{was less}} productive in batting and bowling, and Yorkshire finished only {{eighth in the}} County Championship, a result considered very poor within the county. Rhodes scored 1,465 runs {{at an average of}} 26.63, and took 88 wickets at an average of 18.98, {{the first time since the}} start of his career that he had taken less than 100 wickets in an English season. In 1911, when Yorkshire finished seventh in the County Championship, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine,</b> dry summer, which meant generally good batting wickets. Rhodes was more productive with 2,261 runs, the second and final time that he [...] passed 2,000 runs in an English summer, and the highest season's total of his career. He averaged 38.32 with the bat, and took 117 wickets. Rhodes was given a benefit match against Lancashire from which he received £750 (around £57,000 in 2010). After Yorkshire launched an appeal, the total was boosted to £2,200 (worth around £167,000 in 2010), still considerably less than the record benefit total of £3,703 raised for George Hirst in 1904.|$|E
500|$|In chapter 16 of {{the book}} Skáldskaparmál, a kenning given for Loki is [...] "relative of Sleipnir." [...] In chapter 17, a story is {{provided}} in which Odin rides Sleipnir into the land of Jötunheimr and arrives at the residence of the jötunn Hrungnir. Hrungnir asks [...] "what sort of person this was" [...] wearing a golden helmet, [...] "riding sky and sea," [...] and says that the stranger [...] "has a marvellously good horse." [...] Odin wagers his head that no horse as good {{could be found in}} all of Jötunheimr. Hrungnir admitted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> horse, yet states that he owns a much longer-paced horse; Gullfaxi. Incensed, Hrungnir leaps atop Gullfaxi, intending to attack Odin for Odin's boasting. Odin gallops hard ahead of Hrungnir, and, in his, fury, Hrungnir finds himself having rushed into the gates of Asgard. In chapter 58, Sleipnir is mentioned among a list of horses in Þorgrímsþula: [...] "Hrafn and Sleipnir, splendid horses [...] ". In addition, Sleipnir occurs twice in kennings for [...] "ship" [...] (once appearing in chapter 25 in a work by the skald Refr, and [...] "sea-Sleipnir" [...] appearing in chapter 49 in Húsdrápa, a work by the 10th century skald Úlfr Uggason).|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide praised [...] "David Schwimmer for {{throwing}} himself into this role" [...] as Jared, [...] "this rather unlikable lout." [...] Webb Mitovich also wrote that [...] " [...] party {{in and of}} itself has to be one of 30 Rocks finest and most manic moments." [...] Bob Sassone of AOL's TV Squad thought that [...] " [...] Schwimmer was good as Greenzo" [...] and that [...] "the subplots were some of the most bizarre this season." [...] Robert Canning of IGN thought that the [...] "cameo from Al Gore {{at the end of the}} show added little to the episode. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> bit, but it wasn't helped by the fact that nearly the entire scene had already aired in the promos leading up to the episode" [...] and that [...] "seeing [...] desperately take on the role of Greenzo and then get carried away with the whole concept could have been hysterically self-referential [...] Instead we got Jerrod as Greenzo and the whole thing just felt flat and forced." [...] Canning rated the episode [...] "8 out of 10" [...] Pittsburgh Post-Gazettes Rob Owen also felt that Al Gore's appearance had been [...] "already given away in [...] promos". He praised the episode's dialogue, saying that Baldwin's line, [...] "you could put on a silly hat and tell the kids how outsourcing means cheaper toys for Christmas" [...] was the sort of dialogue that [...] "makes 30 Rock rock. Hard." [...] Jeff Labrecque of Entertainment Weekly wrote that this episode [...] "was one of the best of season 2" [...] and that [...] "Schwimmer's performance reminded [...] of his most bizarre episodes as Friends Ross Geller, like 'The One With Ross's Sandwich'." [...] The episode of Friends referred to includes Schwimmer's character, Ross, shouting at his boss for eating his special Thanksgiving leftover sandwich.|$|E

Also among them was future generals Ulysses S. Grant, and John Rawlins. Rawlins later became Secretary of War when Grant was elected President in 1869. After Rawlins' inspiring speech Grant confided in Rowley, saying that the speech [...] "stirred my patriotism" [...] and had rekindled his military ardor. As the crowd dispersed Rowley said to Grant, [...] "Well Captain Grant, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> meeting after all", where Grant replied quietly, [...] "Yes: we're about to do something now." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1889, President Benjamin Harrison {{authorized}} {{the opening of}} [...] of unoccupied lands in the Oklahoma territory acquired from the native tribes. On April 22, over 100,000 settlers and cattlemen (known as [...] "boomers") lined up at the border, and with the army's guns and bugles giving the signal, began a mad dash into the newly opened land to stake their claims (Land Run of 1889). A witness wrote, [...] "The horsemen had {{the best of it}} from the start. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> race for a few minutes, but soon the riders began to spread out like a fan, {{and by the time they}} reached the horizon they were scattered about as far as the eye could see". In one day, the towns of Oklahoma City, Norman, and Guthrie came into existence. In the same manner, millions of acres of additional land was opened up and settled in the following four years.|$|E

2500|$|Criminal defense {{attorney}} Angelyn Gates of Chase Criminal Defense Attorneys raises concern that citizen groups {{are not subject}} to the same standards as trained law enforcement officials. She notes that laws are designed to keep police officers from violating citizens' rights, and that the same rules don't apply to citizens who may be violating other citizens' rights. [...] "Police officers are trained in theory," [...] Gates said. [...] " [...] are not watching out for themselves by trying to pretend they're a child on the Internet," [...] she said. [...] "They're doing it for the thrill, fun, and notoriety they seem to be getting out of it." [...] Detective Mike Burns of Darke County asserts that Perverted-Justice sets stricter criteria than many law enforcement agencies do for arrest. He contends that Perverted-Justice subscribes to protocols well within those followed by law enforcement. He does however concede, [...] "Sometimes <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> line, but they provided us with 140 people they were chatting with after 10 days with possibilities of showing up for a meeting. There's no way a department five times our size could have done that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Roaring Reggie" [...] {{came from}} the way he would shout at the Japanese guards. This {{subjected}} him to many beatings. Standing up for his men was his main focus. He would do whatever was necessary to protect them and keep them alive. He found that feigning displays of respect for Warrant Officer Aitaro [...] "Tiger" [...] Hiramatusu, the Japanese camp commander, brought more benefits than acts of defiance. [...] But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> line to walk. In an interview with Pattie Wright for her book [...] "The Men of the Line," [...] Len, a 2/19th member recalled how Captain Newton got on the [...] "Tiger's" [...] better side. [...] "The 'Tiger' was a bad one but Reggie got around him. [...] We saw comfort women come into our camp. [...] They were in the last carriage of one of the trains going through. [...] In fact [...] "The Tiger" [...] asked Reggie if he wanted women to come into the camp. [...] I wasn't around for this exchange, but I heard Reggie said he'd prefer a few more bags of rice instead of women." ...|$|E
2500|$|Gaslee {{felt that}} Soviet {{disclosures}} might put the British government at a disadvantage, if a censored version of British involvement in Iran {{had already been}} published; instead he preferred a comprehensive history kept Confidential. General G. M. Kirkpatrick (Chief of the General Staff [...] from 1916 to 1920), took the view that discussion of the Seistan Strategy might upset Iranian sensibilities. Sir Percy Cox (20 November 1864 – 20 February 1937) who had been Chief Political Officer of Indian Expeditionary Force D, told Moberly that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>fine</b> piece of work, free from bias. Moberly wrote to Cox that avoiding controversy would render the volume valueless, {{making it impossible to}} justify British involvement in Iran to the public. Moberly referred to sensitivity over the [...] "corrupt and self-interested attitude" [...] of most Iranian politicians during the war and British fears of unrest in Afghanistan. Cox agreed that a bowdlerised account would be worthless and that Moberly should write without fear or favour, if necessary securing a commercial publisher. At a meeting of the Committee on Official Histories on 9 March 1928, the volume was limited For Official Use Only and since this would increase the cost of the volume, His Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) agreed to pay for it.|$|E
