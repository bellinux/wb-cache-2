25|$|Lütjens was to {{be heavily}} {{involved}} in the planning of the sea landings. The navy wished to land on a narrow front because of its limited resources and Lütjens planned accordingly. He established himself in the fashionable market-town of Trouville near Le Havre. The enormous logistical effort that required the navy to move personnel command structures and personnel to France meant that his command post did not become fully operational until August 1940. Friedrich Ruge {{was appointed to the}} mine command by Lütjens with the task of clearing British naval minefields and laying German mine zones to impede the operations of the Royal Navy. Meanwhile, Lütjens scoured the continent for the 1,800 river barges, 500 tugs, 150 steamships and 1,200 motor boats deemed necessary for the operation. Some 24,000 men were seconded <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>services</b> and trained as landing craft crewman.|$|E
25|$|U.S. Code of law {{explicitly}} {{limits the}} total number of vice admirals that may be on active duty at any given time. The total number of active-duty flag officers is capped at 160 for the navy. For the navy, no more than 16.7% of the service's active-duty flag officers may have more than two stars. Some of these slots can be reserved by statute. Officers serving in certain Defense Agency Director positions such as the Director of the Defense Logistics Agency (DLA), when filled by a naval officer, are vice admirals. The Superintendent of the United States Naval Academy is usually always a vice admiral, either upon nomination or shortly thereafter. The President may also add vice admirals to the Navy if they are offset by removing an equivalent number of three-star officers <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>services.</b> Finally, all statutory limits may be waived at the President's discretion during time of war or national emergency.|$|E

40|$|The {{adoption}} of e-business by Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in construction lags <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>service</b> and product businesses within the building sector. This paper develops {{a model to}} facilitate the uptake of electronic business, especially in relation to SMEs within the Australian construction sector. Ebusiness is defined here as “the undertaking of business-related transactions, communications and information exchanges utilising electronic medium and environment”, the elicited model highlights significant changes needed including skills development, social, economic and cultural issues. The model highlights barriers for SMEs to migrate towards e-transactions, e-bidding, e-tendering and ecollaboration and provides learning and skills development components. The model is derived from case study fieldwork and is to inform diffusion and awareness models for best practice. Empirical techniques included ‘focus group’ interviews and one to one ‘interviews’. Data was transcribed and analysed using cluster analyses. Preliminary results reveal that current models for e-business adoption are not effective within the construction context as they have emerged <b>from</b> <b>other</b> <b>service</b> and product industries - such as retail or tourism. These generic models have largely ignored {{the nature of the}} construction industry, and some modifications appears to be required. This paper proposes an alternative adoption model which is more sensitive {{to the nature of the}} industry – particularly for e-business uptake in building SME’s...|$|R
