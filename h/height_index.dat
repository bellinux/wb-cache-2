50|$|Rucker Index is {{a family}} of indexes {{that are used to}} compare tree {{population}} between different tree sites. It is not species-dependent and can be applied to sites of different sizes. The basic Rucker Index is a measure of overall tree height. The Rucker <b>Height</b> <b>Index</b> 10 or RI10 is the numerical average of the height in feet of the tallest individual of each of the ten tallest species on a site. A particular species enters the index only once. The index provides a numerical evaluation of both maximum height and diversity of the dominant species. High index values are the result of many factors, including climate, topography, soils, and a lack of disturbance. While the most extensive sites benefit from a greater variety of habitat and more individual trees, some exceptional sites are quite small. The Rucker <b>Height</b> <b>Index</b> is essentially a foreshortened version of a complete profile of all the species found on a particular site.|$|E

40|$|BackgroundPincer nail {{deformity}} is a transverse overcurvature of the nail. This study {{aimed to}} define the anatomical characteristics of pincer nail deformity and to evaluate the surgical outcomes. MethodsA retrospective review was conducted on 20 cases of pincer nail deformity of the great toe. Thirty subjects without pincer nail deformity or history of trauma of the feet were selected as the control group. Width and <b>height</b> <b>indices</b> were calculated, and interphalangeal angles and base widths of the distal phalanx were measured with radiography. We chose the surgical treatment methods considering perfusion-related factors such as age, diabetes mellitus, kidney disease, and peripheral vascular disease. The zigzag nail bed flap method (n= 9) and the inverted T incision method (n= 11) were used to repair deformities. The outcomes were evaluated 6 months after surgery. ResultsThe interphalangeal angle was significantly greater in the preoperative patient group (14. 0 °± 3. 6 °) than {{in the control group}} (7. 9 °± 3. 0 °) (P< 0. 05). The postoperative width and <b>height</b> <b>indices</b> were very close to the measurements in the control group, and most patients were satisfied with the outcomes. ConclusionsWe believe that the width and <b>height</b> <b>indices</b> are useful for evaluating the deformity and outcomes of surgical treatments. We used two different surgical methods for the two patient groups with respect to the perfusion-related factors and found that the outcomes were all satisfactory.

Anthropometric analyses of standardized frontal view and profile photographs may help elucidate such changes. Material and Methods: Photographs of 31 edentulous patients were compared in relaxed lip closure and after insertion of a CRDP in stable occlusion. 2232 anthropometric distances were raised. Eighteen anthropometric indices reflecting the perioral morphology and its integration in the vertical facial harmony were investigated. Results: The intercanthal – mouth width index (p <. 001), medial – lateral cutaneous upper lip <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 007), lower vermilion contour index (p=. 022), vermilion – total upper lip <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 018), cutaneous – total up - per lip <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 023), upper lip – nose <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 001), nose – upper face <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 002), chin – mandible <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 013), upper lip – mandible <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 045), nose – lower face <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 018), and nose - face <b>height</b> <b>index</b> (p=. 029) showed significant pre- to post-treatment changes.

All patients had a forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) less than 50 % predicted, an arterial oxygen tension of more than 7. 3 kPa, and no severe locomotor, cardiovascular, neurological, or endocrine disorders. Exercise performance was assessed from a 12 minute walking test; body weight (as a percentage of ideal weight), creatinine <b>height</b> <b>index,</b> and serum concentrations of albumin, transferrin, and prealbumin were assessed as measures of nutritional state. Mean values of the nutritional variables were within the normal range. The mean (SD) 12 minute walking distance was 686 (254) metres. Walking distance was positively associated with serum albumin concentration and creatinine <b>height</b> <b>index</b> but not with body weight, serum prealbumin, or serum transferrin concentrations.

Indexing body composition to stature seems more appropriate. but the decline in height with age or osteoporosis could confound comparisons ofbody composition across age or disease groups. Using bioimpedance data from 600 adults in the Framingham Offspring Study, we examined the ability of height and knee <b>height</b> <b>indexes</b> to correctly describe the loss of FFM seen with increasing age between 28 and 75 y. Indexing body composition to height obscured the loss of FFM with age (r =- 0. 065. P < 0. 26 for men: r =- 0. 050, P < 0. 394 for women), whereas indexing body composition to knee height preserved the correct information (r =- 0. 154. P < 0. 007 for men: r =- 0. 16 1, P < 0. 006 for women). These data suggest that knee height is a reliable surrogate for stature and should be used to adjust body composition measurements when bioimpedance is used to estimate body composition. Am...|$|R

This cross-sectional study involves 200 healthy Malay school children aged seven and twelve year old. Each group of children consisted of 50 males and 50 females. These children were selected from Sekolah Kebangsaan Bandar Baru Bangi, Selangor. Twenty-two (22) linear anthropometric measurements were taken and seventeen (17) proportions indices were derived from these linear measurements. Results showed that eighteen (18) of the twenty two (22) linear anthropometric measurement were higher in elder group of both gender and this finding was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). Head length and head circumference were statistically significantly higher in female whereas the head height was higher in elder male. The eye fissure height was the only measurement that showed a significantly smaller reading in elder groups of both genders (p< 0. 05). Three indices namely the middle-lower face depth index, eye fissure index and upper lip height-mouth width index were significantly smaller (p< 0. 05) in the elder group and this were observed for both genders. The proportion index for the nasal tip protrusion-nose width index was higher in elder group of both genders (p< 0. 05). The lower-upper lip <b>height</b> <b>index</b> and mouth-face width index were significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in elder male whereas the proportion index for nose-face <b>height</b> <b>index</b> was Abstract iii higher in elder female (p< 0. 05). In contrast with intercanthal index, was significantly lower in elder female (p< 0. 05). Gender-wise, it was noted that the male exhibited larger measurements than female for both aged groups. For the 7 -year-olds, the mean value showed a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between genders only in 6 linear measurements. These were head width, head length, maxillary depth, mandibular depth, binocular width and upper lip height. As for proportion indices in this group of children, the significant difference (p< 0. 05) between genders were noted only in upper lip height-mouth width index and lower-upper lip <b>height</b> <b>index.</b> Male have a higher measurement in upper lip-height index. However female have a higher lower-upper lip <b>height</b> <b>index</b> than male and the result was statistically significant (p< 0. 05). For 12 -year-old group, again the males generally have a larger measurement than females. The linear anthropometric measurements were significantly different (p< 0. 05) between genders in 5 parameters.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Research {{in speech}} prosody and {{ethology}} suggests that pitch <b>height</b> <b>indexes</b> {{positive and negative}} social affects, {{in the sense that}} higher pitched voices are used to convey friendliness, whereas lower pitched voices are used to convey aggression (Bolinger, 1964). Research concerning animal calls suggests that this association generalizes to many species. In a study of the calls for 56 species, Morton (1977, 1994) proposed a sound-size model in which large size (and low pitch) is associated with aggression, whereas small size (and high pitch) is associated with friendliness, fear, or appeasement. We examine whether this association can be observed in music. Specifically, the results of three studies are reported in which the pitch-height of various voices is related to estimates of the sociability of the corresponding operatic characters. Results indeed indicate an association between lower-pitched voices and less sociable characters, in contrast to higher-pitched voices being associated with more sociable characters. In addition, older male characters tend to exhibit lower-pitched voices, consistent with known physiological changes (Linville, 2004; Reubold, Harrington &...|$|R

The anterior facial proportions were studied, based in following dimensions: N-Me (AFT), N-ENA (AFS) e ENA-Me (AFI). The Facial <b>Height</b> <b>Index</b> (IAF) was also evaluated taking in account the relationship between the Ar-Go (AFP) and the distance between the palatal plane and the menton (AFA). The results showed that growth tendencies were balanced; the Lower Facial Height dimension contributed more significantly to the Total Facial Height changes; the anterior facial proportions were around 42 % for the Upper Facial Height and 58 % for the Lower Facial height; the Facial <b>Height</b> <b>Index</b> was stable, around 0, 66 or had a tendency to increase, according to the age; there were no sexual dimorphism in Anterior Facial Proportion and Facial <b>Height</b> <b>Index...</b>|$|E
40|$|Five forested wetland {{sites in}} western Kentucky with hydrologic regimes varying from {{seasonally}} to continu- ously flooded were investigated for net above-ground biomass productivity (litterfall plus biomass growth) and for possible indicators of that productivity, including abiotic (flooding frequency and depth, phosphorus concentrations {{in water and}} sediments) and biotic (biomass, tree density, basal area, structural complexity, and mean <b>height)</b> <b>indices.</b> Net biomass productivity ranged from 205 g for a stagnant nently flooded swamp to 1, 334 g in a bottomland forest along the Ohio River. Produc- tivity was highest in wetlands with pulsing hydroperiods, intermediate with slowly flowing systems, and lowest with stagnant conditions. Surface water flooding of the wetlands {{during the growing season}} ranged from 17 to 100 percent of the year and did not predict productivity. Phosphorus concentrations in water and in sediments were not correlated to one another and did not, by themselves, predict productivity. No single abiotic variable predicted the exact ranking of productivity of the sites. Of the biotic variables, average tree diameter was inversely related to productivity...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to: (1) evaluate accuracy of tree height measurements of manual stereo viewing on a computer display using digital aerial photographs compared with airborne LiDAR height measurements; and (2) develop an empirical model to estimate stand-level aboveground biomass with variables derived from manual stereo viewing on the computer display in a Cambodian tropical seasonal forest. We evaluate observation error of tree height measured from the manual stereo viewing, based on field measurements. RMSEs of tree height measurement with manual stereo viewing and LiDAR were 1. 96 m and 1. 72 m, respectively. Then, stand-level aboveground biomass is regressed against tree <b>height</b> <b>indices</b> derived from the manual stereo viewing. We determined the best model to estimate aboveground biomass in terms of the Akaike’s information criterion. This was a model of mean tree height of the tallest five trees in each plot (R 2 = 0. 78; RMSE = 58. 18 Mg/ha). In conclusion, manual stereo viewing on the computer display can measure tree height accurately and is useful to estimate aboveground stand biomass...|$|R
40|$|Research {{in speech}} prosody and {{ethology}} suggests that pitch <b>height</b> <b>indexes</b> {{positive and negative}} social affects, {{in the sense that}} higher pitched voices are used to convey friendliness, whereas lower pitched voices are used to convey aggression (Bolinger, 1964). Research concerning animal calls suggests that this association generalizes to many species. In a study of the calls for 56 species, Morton (1977, 1994) proposed a sound-size model in which large size (and low pitch) is associated with aggression, whereas small size (and high pitch) is associated with friendliness, fear, or appeasement. We examine whether this association can be observed in music. Specifically, the results of three studies are reported in which the pitch-height of various voices is related to estimates of the sociability of the corresponding operatic characters. Results indeed indicate an association between lower-pitched voices and less sociable characters, in contrast to higher-pitched voices being associated with more sociable characters. In addition, older male characters tend to exhibit lower-pitched voices, consistent with known physiological changes (Linville, 2004; Reubold, Harrington & Kleber, 2010) ...|$|R
