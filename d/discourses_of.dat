The Bahá'ís around the world are currently being encouraged to focus on capacity building through children's classes, youth groups, devotional gatherings, and a systematic study of the religion known as study circles. Further focuses are involvement in social action and participation in the prevalent <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> society. The years from 2001 until 2021 represent four successive five-year plans, culminating in the centennial anniversary of the passing of `Abdu'l-Bahá.|$|E
5|$|After The English Teacher, Narayan's {{writings}} {{took a more}} {{imaginative and}} creative external style compared to the semi-autobiographical tone of the earlier novels. His next effort, Mr. Sampath, was the first book exhibiting this modified approach. However, it still draws from {{some of his own}} experiences, particularly the aspect of starting his own journal; he also makes a marked movement away from his earlier novels by intermixing biographical events. Soon after, he published The Financial Expert, considered to be his masterpiece and hailed {{as one of the most}} original works of fiction in 1951. The inspiration for the novel was a true story about a financial genius, Margayya, related to him by his brother. The next novel, Waiting for the Mahatma, loosely based on a fictional visit to Malgudi by Mahatma Gandhi, deals with the protagonist's romantic feelings for a woman, when he attends the <b>discourses</b> <b>of</b> the visiting Mahatma. The woman, named Bharti, is a loose parody of Bharati, the personification of India and the focus of Gandhi's discourses. While the novel includes significant references to the Indian independence movement, the focus is on the life of the ordinary individual, narrated with Narayan's usual dose of irony.|$|E

40|$|This Bachelor Thesis, {{conducted}} {{in the field of}} Religious Studies, concerns the different discourses that have formed around HIV/AIDS, as formulated by religious leaders, and the stigmatising effects these discourses can have. This study was inspired by a statement made by Gillian Patterson, claiming that the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> compassion is often deeply stigmatising. The research question therefore asks: What did Patterson mean when she wrote that the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> compassion, as formulated by the Roman Catholic and Anglican communities in sub Saharan Africa, is merely another (unintended) way to stigmatize the people infected with HIV/AIDS? This thesis compares the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> compassionate hope to the concept of stigma and the discourses that have been known for their stigmatising effects. The discourses that have been singled out for this purpose are the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> morality and the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> war. These <b>discourses,</b> along with the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> compassionate hope, have been analysed by statements made by Roman Catholic and Anglican church leaders in sub Saharan Africa...|$|R

The {{method of analysis}} of the material obtained in the conversations with students is discourse analysis. First, two dominant strategies of focus group usage are discussed: as means for collecting data from subjects and as a social emancipatory practice. The prevailing discourses about school failure of students are mapped: the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> school as an insecure investment, the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> school marginalisation, the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> disinterest <b>of</b> students, the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> disinterest of teachers and the discourse 'school success {{does not have an}} alternative'.

Another person raised in a very different Discourse community might find himself or herself at a disadvantage when trying to move within the Discourse of business, trying to get a loan, for instance.

40|$|Objective: Body image dissatisfaction is intensifying and {{individuals}} are being encouraged to highlight their imperfections, rather than embrace their uniqueness. The present study conducted a qualitative investigation of {{negative and positive}} pressures influencing females to engage in self-criticism or self-love. Method: Twenty-four female participants, ranging in ages from 18 to 58 (M = 24. 5, SD = 9. 9) completed a battery of questionnaires to determine initial body image concern and subsequently partook in a semi-structured interview to delve into the complexities of individual experience. An average split was conducted on questionnaire data to group participants into high or low concern groups. Subsequently, a comparative discourse analysis was employed to extract commonalities between groups. Results: Similarities and differences in the groups were divided into six discourses: (1) <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> Body Shape; (2) <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> Insecurity; (3) <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> Media Exposure; (4) <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> Acceptance; (5) <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> Comparison; (6) <b>Discourse</b> <b>of</b> Family. Conclusions: Negative body image is most prevalent in female populations, with the current research displaying {{a significant difference in}} the internalisation of influential factors. Appearance concerns are evidently at the forefront of societal interactions and future research should further investigate such interactions...|$|R

25|$|The {{text of the}} Discourses was {{originally}} published serially as essays dictated by Baba on spiritual subjects, intended for inclusion in a monthly periodical titled Meher Baba Journal. The Journal was edited in India and published in New York, and lasted from Nov. 1938 to Oct. 1942. At {{the end of each}} year of publication, the essays by Baba from the Journal were compiled into a single volume, published in India. These compilation printings, over the period from 1939 to 1943, resulted in a five-volume set of books titled <b>Discourses</b> <b>of</b> Meher Baba. As these went out of print, slightly corrected editions were released of each volume. These printings are now collectively referred to as the 1st - 5th editions of the Discourses.|$|E
40|$|This paper studies how {{subjectivity}} in capitalist {{culture can}} be characterised. Building on Lacan’s later seminars XVI, XVII, XVIII and XIX, the author first outlines Lacan’s general discourse theory, which includes four characteristic discourses: the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the master, the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the university, the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the hysteric and the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the analyst. Next, the author explores the subjectivity and {{the mode of}} dealing with jouissance and semblance, which is entailed in a fifth type <b>of</b> <b>discourse,</b> the capitalist discourse, discussed by Lacan in 1972. Indeed, like the other discourses that Lacan discerns, the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the capitalist {{can be thought of}} as a mode of dealing with the sexual non-rapport. It is argued that in the case <b>of</b> neurosis the <b>discourse</b> <b>of</b> the capitalist functions as an attempt to ignore the sexual non-rapport and the dimension of the unconscious. Psychosis, by contrast, is marked by an a priori exclusion from discourse. In that case, consumerist ways of relating to the other might offer a semblance, and thus the possibility of inventing a mode of relating to the other. Two clinical vignettes are presented to illustrate this perspective: one concerning the neurotic structure and one concerning the psychotic structure...|$|R
