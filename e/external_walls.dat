5|$|Both the <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> {{and those}} around the keep were fitted with merlons and {{parapets}}, with the parapets of the keep positioned 6.5 meters higher {{than their counterparts}} along the external wall. This was done to establish a secondary defensive line that enabled the building's defenders to shoot arrows at attackers who breached the <b>external</b> <b>walls.</b> The core building {{was linked to the}} external fortifications by corridors and chambers.|$|E
5|$|The {{last major}} {{building}} phase was the sixth, which saw {{the restoration of}} the eastern and western <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> after they were severely damaged by Mongol besiegers. A northeastern salient bastion, much smaller than the eastern and western bastions, was also built. Masonry from the fifth phase was reused for the reconstruction along with new gypsum, limestone and other materials. The seventh and eighth phases both consisted of heightening al-Rahba's western <b>external</b> <b>walls.</b>|$|E
5|$|Work {{planned for}} 1985 {{included}} {{the replacement of}} the dust floor window and completion of the stocks and sails.

5|$|Arrowslits, also {{commonly}} called loopholes, were narrow vertical openings in defensive walls which allowed arrows or crossbow bolts {{to be fired}} on attackers. The narrow slits were intended to protect the defender by providing a very small target, but {{the size of the}} opening could also impede the defender if it was too small. A smaller horizontal opening could be added to give an archer a better view for aiming. Sometimes a sally port was included; this could allow the garrison to leave the castle and engage besieging forces. It was usual for the latrines to empty down the <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> of a castle and into the surrounding ditch.|$|E
5|$|The {{second phase}} of {{construction}} added three salient bastions, each of which were over {{twice the size of}} the northern bastion. The new bastions were placed along the part of al-Rahba's citadel that faced the desert to the west. The builders in the second phase also reinforced al-Rahba's walls with roughly cut conglomerate blocks fixed together by high-quality mortar. In the third phase, higher quality mudbrick was used, the western curtain wall was elevated and the southwestern curtain wall was replaced and decorated with bands of Arabic inscriptions. In addition, a large, brick dome was built atop the ground-level chamber of the northwestern bastion. The <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> of the fortress reached their final form during the third phase, though there would be further restorations in later decades.|$|E

40|$|<b>External</b> <b>wall</b> {{insulation}} {{plays an}} important role in building energy consumption through affecting cooling and heating energy uses. In this paper, a study on the effects of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> insulation thickness on annual cooling and heating energy uses under different Chinese climates is reported. Firstly, two indexes: Energy Gain Ratio (EGR) and Relative Variation Ratio (RVR) of the sum of annual cooling and heating energy uses, to assess the effects of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> insulation thickness on energy saving potential are introduced. Secondly, a model space having four different exterior zones facing four different orientations in an office building is presented and the settings of the model space described. Lastly, the simulated annual cooling and heating energy uses for the four different exterior zones at different <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> insulation thicknesses under three different climates in China, Guangzhou, Shanghai and Beijing, are reported. The results suggested that energy saving was significant by increasing the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> insulation thickness in exterior zones facing all orientations under Beijing's climate, since the heating energy use was dominant and can be reduced remarkably with the increase in insulation thickness. Under Shanghai's climate, increasing <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> insulation thickness to over 26. mm would not reduce the sum of annual heating and cooling energy uses in the south-facing exterior zone, but would help save energy in exterior zones facing the other three orientations. For all exterior zones under Guangzhou's climate, it was, however, hardly possible to reduce the sum of annual heating and cooling energy uses by increasing the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> insulation thickness.

5|$|The {{courtyard}} was rebuilt, {{the architect}} Dominique Gallo designing two arcades, stretching between points H and C. The arcades, fronting the earlier wing by Lucien I, each have twelve arches, decorated by white marble balustrading {{on the upper}} level. Today the upper arcades are known as the Galerie d'Hercule (gallery of Hercules) because their ceilings were painted with scenes depicting the Labours of Hercules by Orazio de Ferrari during the later reign of Honoré II. These arcades or loggias provide corridors to the state rooms in the south wing (today known as the State Rooms Wings). On {{the other side of}} the courtyard a new wing was constructed and the Genoese artist Luca Cambiasi was charged with painting its <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> with frescoes. It is thought that the galleries (B) to the north wing overlooking the harbour were built at this time.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of residential housing and other buildings on the site in 1988–89, several underground sections of the bunker complex were uncovered by work crews. In April 1988, the East German government allowed several visits to the site by photo-journalists. Water was pumped out of the Vorbunker for four days before access could be made via the underground passageway which led from the Chancellery. The interior floor of the Vorbunker {{was covered with a}} muddy sludge from having been underwater for so many years. Old empty wine bottles were found {{on the floor of the}} kitchen and wine store room. Still present in the room next to the kitchen were the broken frames of the bunk beds used by the Goebbels children. At the end of the hallway were the stairs leading down to the Führerbunker. However, the men could go no further than the mid-landing, as the Führerbunker was still underwater and the ceiling beyond the doorway had collapsed due to the demolitions performed in 1947. After these inspections, work crews for the most part removed and destroyed the bunker complex. The Vorbunkers top and <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> were the first structures to be torn down. The construction of buildings in the area around the complex was a strategy for ensuring the surroundings remained anonymous and unremarkable. The emergency exit point for the Führerbunker (which had been in the Chancellery gardens) was occupied by a car park.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examined}} the thermal effects of building&# 39;s <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> surfaces, using observational data of spatial-temporal distribution of surface temperature, air temperature, and heat flux {{into and out of}} external surface. Results indicate that <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> surface temperature and nearby air temperature vary with the change of orientation, height and season. In general, the <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> surface temperature is lower near the ground, and is higher near the roof, than nearby air temperature. But north wall surface temperature is mostly lower than nearby air temperature at the same height; south wall surface temperature during the daytime in December, and west wall surface temperature all day in August, is respectively higher than nearby air temperature. The heat fluxes into and out of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> surfaces show the differences that exist in the various orientations, heights and seasons. In December, south wall surface at the lower sites emits heat and north wall surface at the higher sites absorbs heat. In April, all <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> surfaces, emit heat near the ground and absorb heat near the roof. In August, west wall surface all day emits heat, and other wall surfaces just show the commensurate behavior with that in April...|$|R

25|$|This {{relatively}} small château {{is divided into}} two sections, the main central body and a wing at right angles to it, and displays a blend of architectural styles. The influence of the fashionable Italian renaissance style is clear in its long proportions and ornate sculptural decorations. Alongside these Italiante elements are vestiges of medieval defensive architecture, such as the traces of the covered walkway on the <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> or the machicolations under the roof, which were no longer necessary for defence but were incorporated in the château's design because of their symbolic prestige.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} feature of the farmhouse, albeit one which is not externally visible, is its internal, wooden, post-and-beam construction which supports the entire building. The frame was originally made of oak, which was very durable, but from the 18th century it was also made from cheaper pinewood. To protect it from damp, the wooden posts rest on a stone foundation about 50cm high, often made of fieldstone. The non weight-bearing <b>external</b> <b>walls</b> were built as timber frames, the panels of which were originally filled in with willow wickerwork and clay (wattle and daub) and, later, with brick.|$|E
25|$|The unique {{importance}} of the Cathedral Church of the Holy Cross comes from the extensive array of bas-relief carving of mostly biblical scenes that adorn its <b>external</b> <b>walls.</b> The meanings of these reliefs {{have been the subject}} of much and varied interpretation. Some of this is speculation - for example, a few sources interpret Islamic and Turkic influences behind the artistic rendering of the reliefs, syncretised with Armenian influences. Some scholars assert that the friezes parallel contemporary motifs found in Umayyad art - such as a turbaned prince, Arab styles of dress, wine imagery; allusions to royal Sassanian imagery are also present (Griffins, for example).|$|E
40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to provide a {{comprehensive}} review of the literature concerning the various causes of failures of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> tile finishes. Design/methodology/approach - A 4 × 3 matrix hierarchy framework is developed for a systematic analysis of the literature reviewed. Findings - The findings from this paper indicate the importance of environmental effects, movement joints, and adhesive on the performance of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> tile finishes. Thermal and moisture effects induce movement of tiles, and the failure of the tiling system depends very much on the adhesive strength and the provision of movement joints. Workmanship is also a key factor affecting the performance of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> tile finishes and should not be overlooked. Research limitations/implications - Various studies have been carried out on the causes of defects in external finishes in the past. However, many of them were case-oriented and were not supported by laboratory findings. The hierarchical framework developed in this paper serves as a basis for further laboratory and field studies on this issue. Practical implications - The framework is conducive to the diagnosis of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> tile delamination. Originality/value - This paper reviews systematically and comprehensively the literature on the causes of <b>external</b> <b>wall</b> tile delamination. © Emerald Group Publishing Limited. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
