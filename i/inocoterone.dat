50|$|<b>Inocoterone</b> acetate (USAN) (developmental code names RU-38882, RU-882) is a steroid-like nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) {{that was}} developed for topical administration to treat acne but was never marketed. It is the acetate ester of <b>inocoterone,</b> which is less potent in comparison. <b>Inocoterone</b> acetate is actually not a silent antagonist of the androgen receptor but rather a weak partial agonist, similarly to steroidal antiandrogens like cyproterone acetate.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inocoterone</b> (INN) is a steroid-like nonsteroidal {{antiandrogen}} (NSAA) {{that was}} never marketed. An acetate ester, <b>inocoterone</b> acetate, shows greater antiandrogen activity and was developed as a topical medication {{for the treatment of}} acne but showed only modest effectiveness in clinical trials and similarly was never marketed.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Inocoterone</b> acetate (RU-38882, RU-882): A steroid-like NSAA. It {{was under}} {{development}} as a topical medication {{for the treatment of}} acne but was discontinued due to insufficient effectiveness in clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inocoterone</b> acetate was {{investigated}} {{for the treatment}} of acne but showed only modest (albeit statistically significant) efficacy in clinical trials. A reduction of 26% of lesions was observed in males treated with the drug after 16 weeks (~3.7 months). However, this is notably far less than that achieved with other agents such as benzoyl peroxide or antibiotics, which produce 50-75% reductions within 2 months. Similar poor results with the topical route have disappointingly been found for other antiandrogens such as cyproterone acetate and spironolactone.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} AR antagonists have been {{developed}} for topical use but have not completed development and hence have never been marketed. These include the steroidal AR antagonists cortexolone 17α-propionate, cyproterone, rosterolone, and topterone and the nonsteroidal AR antagonists cioteronel, <b>inocoterone</b> acetate, RU-22930, RU-58642, and RU-58841. However, one topical AR antagonist, topilutamide (fluridil), has been introduced in a few European countries for the treatment of androgenic alopecia in men. In addition, a topical 5α-reductase inhibitor and weak estrogen, alfatradiol, has also been introduced in some European countries for the same indication, although its effectiveness is controversial. Spironolactone has been marketed in Italy {{in the form of a}} topical cream under the brand name Spiroderm for the treatment of acne and hirsutism, but this formulation was discontinued and hence is no longer available.|$|E
