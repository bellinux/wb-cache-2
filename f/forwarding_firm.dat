40|$|The author {{explored}} estimation {{by analogy}} (EBA) {{as a means}} of estimating the cost of international freight consignment. A version of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm (k-NN) was tested by predicting job costs from a database of over 5000 actual jobs booked by an Irish freight <b>forwarding</b> <b>firm</b> over a seven year period. The effect of a computer intensive training process on overall accuracy of the method was found to be insignificant when the method was implemented with four or fewer neighbors. Overall, the accuracy of the analogy based method, while still significantly less accurate than manually working up estimates, might be worthwhile to implement in practice, depending labor costs in an adopting firm. A simulation model was used to compare manual versus analytical estimation methods. The point of indifference occurs when it takes a firm more than 1. 5 worker hours to prepare a manual estimate (at current Irish labor costs). Suggestions are given for future experiments to improve the sampling policy of the method to improve accuracy and to improve overall scalability...|$|E

A descriptive survey design was used on freight <b>forwarding</b> <b>firms.</b> The researcher used purposive sampling to select firms for the study.

The study found out that; demurrage charges through delays, wars, loss from fire out breaks, piracy, damage and destruction of goods, sinking of vessels and fraud by employees in position of authority were the major factors hindering the success of this industry in facilitating imports and exports. The government should also make use of the latest technologies so as to increase the speed of clearing goods such that they reach their final point of consumption within the shortest possible time.

Hedging is imperfect in that the firm can only trade one of the two foreign currencies forward.

Furthermore, the firm is shown to export more (less) to the foreign country whose currency can (cannot) be traded <b>forward.</b> The <b>firm's</b> optimal <b>forward</b> position is an over-hedge or an under-hedge, depending on whether the spot exchange rates are positively or negatively correlated in the sense of expectation dependence, respectively.

Break bulk cargo is usually manufactured goods and is transported in packages, often stacked on pallets. Before the arrival of containerization in the 1950s, these goods were loaded, transported and unloaded piecemeal.

In order to remain competitive, local freight forwarders in Hong Kong must establish a long-term union relationship with their customers such as the provision of customized logistics services. One of the ways is {{through the use of a}} co-loading shipment plan, which is a knowledge intensive and complex process involving multiple knowledge source and decision rules. This paper presents hybrid knowledge and model system, which integrates mathematical models with knowledge rules, in the formulation of such co-loading shipment plans. A strategic knowledge-based planning system, (SKPS) integrates knowledge rules with mathematical model for solving problems of co-loading shipment plans formulation and market constriction prevention, is proposed. The system was implemented in Elite World Logistics Service Limited (EW), a local freight forwarding company, for supporting the planning process of a co-loading shipping plan.
