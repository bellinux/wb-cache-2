50|$|In {{contrast}} with {{other types of}} High Speed Machining toolpaths, VoluMill toolpaths are typically run at axial depths of cut up to the full <b>flute</b> <b>length</b> of the Milling cutter. But they are also effective in high speed shallow-axial, deep-radial cutting; a stepover between passes of up to 100% of the flat of the tool can be safely used without leaving any uncut material.|$|E
50|$|Jobber-length drills are {{the most}} {{commonly}} found type of drill. The length of the flutes is between 9 and 14 times {{the diameter of the}} drill, depending on the drill size. So a 1/2 in diameter drill will be able to drill a hole 4+1/2 in deep, since it is 9 times the diameter in length. A 1/8 in diameter drill can drill a hole 1+5/8 in deep, since it is 13 times the diameter in <b>flute</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

40|$|According to {{previous}} research of dynamic end milling models, the instantaneous dynamic radii on every cutting position affects the cutting forces directly since the simulated forces are {{proportional to the}} chip thickness, and the chip thickness {{is a function of}} dynamic radii and feedrate. With the concept of flute engagement introduced, it is important to discuss it with respect to radial and axial depths of cut because the length of the engaged flutes is affected by factors in the axial feed and rotational directions. Radial and axial depths of cut affect the “contact area”, which is the area that a cutter contacts with the workpiece. When radial and axial depths of cut increase, the cutting forces also increase since the engaged <b>flute</b> <b>lengths</b> are increased. Therefore, {{in order to have a}} clearer idea of the milling forces, the influences of dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, and radial and axial depths of cut are discussed in this paper. Key Words: simulated forces, milling forces, dynamic radii, cutting feedrate, flute engagement, radial and axial depths of cut, rake angle 1...|$|R
5000|$|The {{straight}} shank {{is the most}} usual style on modern drill bits, by number manufactured. The whole of the drill bit, shaft and shank, is usually of the same diameter. It is held usually in a 3-jaw drill chuck. Bits of diameter too small to grip firmly can have {{straight shank}}s of larger diameter than the drill, which can be held firmly in a standard size colet or chuck. Large drill bits can have straight shanks narrower than the drill diameter {{so that they can}} be fitted in chucks not able to chuck the full diameter. Such a drill bit is called a reduced-shank or blacksmith's drill. For example, this allows a 1/2" [...] bit to be used in a pistol-grip drill's 3/8" [...] chuck. One particular type of reduced-shank drill bits are Silver & Deming (S&D) bits, whose sets run from 9/16" [...] to 1-1/2" [...] drill body diameter with a standard 1/2" [...] reduced shank for all. This allows drill presses with 1/2" [...] chucks to run the larger drills. S&D bits are 6" [...] long with a 3" [...] <b>flute</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
40|$|Modeling of {{drill bit}} {{behavior}} under applied forces {{as well as}} modeling of the drilling process itself can aid {{in the understanding of}} the relative importance of the various drill bit process parameters and can eventually lead to improved drill bit designs. In this paper the authors illustrate the application of ABAQUS Standard to the stress and deformation analysis of micro-electronics drill bits that are used in manufacturing printed circuit boards. Effects of varying point geometry, web taper and <b>flute</b> <b>length</b> on the stress and deformation in a drill bit are illustrated...|$|E
40|$|This work is {{undertaken}} {{in the attempt to}} understand the processes at work {{at the cutting edge of}} the twist drill. Extensive drill life testing performed by the University has reinforced a survey of previously published information. This work demonstrated that there are two specific aspects of drilling which have not previously been explained comprehensively. The first concerns the interrelating of process data between differing drilling situations, There is no method currently available which allows the cutting geometry of drilling to be defined numerically so that such comparisons, where made, are purely subjective. Section one examines this problem by taking as an example a 4. 5 mm drill suitable for use with aluminium. This drill is examined using a prototype solid modelling program to explore how the required numerical information may be generated. The second aspect is the analysis of drill stiffness. What aspects of drill stiffness provide the very great difference in performance between short <b>flute</b> <b>length,</b> medium <b>flute</b> <b>length</b> and long <b>flute</b> <b>length</b> drills? These differences exist between drills of identical point geometry and the practical superiority of short drills has been known to shop floor drilling operatives since drilling was first introduced. This problem has been dismissed repeatedly as over complicated but section two provides a first approximation and shows that at least for smaller drills of 4. 5 mm the effects are highly significant. Once the cutting action of the twist drill is defined geometrically there is a huge body of machinability data that becomes applicable to the drilling process. Work remains to interpret the very high inclination angles of the drill cutting process in terms of cutting forces and tool wear but aspects of drill design may already be looked at in new ways with the prospect of a more analytical approach rather than the present mix of experience and trial and error. Other problems are specific to the twist drill, such as the behaviour of the chips in the flute. It is now possible to predict the initial direction of chip flow leaving the drill cutting edge. For the future the parameters of further chip behaviour may also be explored within this geometric model...|$|E

5000|$|An {{instrument}} {{consisting of}} two attached, parallel, end-blown <b>flutes</b> of differing <b>length,</b> dating to the 15th or 16th century, was found in poor condition near All Souls College in Oxford. The instrument has four holes finger-holes and a thumb hole for each hand. The pipes have an inverted conical [...] "choke" [...] bore (see Renaissance structure). Bob Marvin has estimated that the pipes played a fifth apart, at approximately C5 and G5. The instrument is sui generis. Although the instrument's pipes have thumb holes, the lack of organological precedent makes classification of the instrument difficult. Marvin has used the terms [...] "double recorder" [...] and the categorization-agnostic flauto doppio (double flute) to describe the Oxford instrument.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—For smaller {{mechatronic}} device, {{especially for}} micro Electronic system, a micro machining is a must. However, most investigations on vibration of a mill {{have been limited}} to the traditional type mill. In this article, vibration and dynamic characteristics of a micro mill were investigated in this study. The trend towards higher precision manufacturing technology requires producing miniaturized components. To improve micro-milled product quality, obtain a higher production rate and avoid milling breakage, the dynamic characteristics of micro milling must be studied. A stepped pre-twisted mill is used to simulate the micro mill. The finite element analysis is employed in this work. The <b>flute</b> <b>length</b> and diameter effects of the micro mill are considered. It {{is clear that the}} effects of micro mill shape parameters on vibration in a micro mill are significant.

40|$|This {{research}} was conducted {{in order to establish}} very clearly the morphological indices of the E. T. H. race bred to Izvin Stud, and also to highlight its strengths, weaknesses and sports skills. Based on these assessments and morphological indices calculation we can give guidance on the improvement direction of this population of horses, usage of breeders and correct some deficiencies. The study was carried out on a number of 83 individuals of ETH race (7 satllions and and 76 mares) belonging to Izvin Stud, Timis county and considered parameters were: height at withers, height at croup, height at the base of tail, diagonal length of the trunk, chest depth, chest width, torax width, croup width at hips, forearm length, <b>flute</b> <b>length,</b> thoracic perimeter, whistle perimeter, body weight. Obtained morphological index values show the superiority of breeding adults with 1. 74 % for the character height at withers and with 3. 41 % for the character body mass compared with data obtained from other locations in the country. Instead, the character chest depth recorded lower values with 0. 75 % and the character chest perimeter with 2. 11 % in the same conditions...|$|E
50|$|One of {{the famous}} myths of Pan {{involves}} the origin of his pan <b>flute,</b> fashioned from <b>lengths</b> of hollow reed. Syrinx was a lovely wood-nymph of Arcadia, daughter of Landon, the river-god. As she was returning from the hunt one day, Pan met her. To escape from his importunities, the fair nymph ran away and didn't stop to hear his compliments. He pursued from Mount Lycaeum until she came to her sisters who immediately changed her into a reed. When the air blew through the reeds, it produced a plaintive melody. The god, still infatuated, took some of the reeds, {{because he could not}} identify which reed she became, and cut seven pieces (or according to some versions, nine), joined them side by side in gradually decreasing lengths, and formed the musical instrument bearing the name of his beloved Syrinx. Henceforth Pan was seldom seen without it.|$|R
5000|$|These bone flutes have average {{dimensions}} of approximately 20 x 1.1 cm, and {{are made from}} {{the wings of the}} red-crowned crane. They are open-ended and vary in the number of their finger holes, from one to eight; the 24 holed version has 23 holes in front and one thumb hole in back. Jiahu bone whistles are much shorter than the <b>flutes,</b> with <b>lengths</b> of 5.7 to 10.5 cm, and having only a couple of holes. The number of holes and the spacing between the holes determined the musical range and scale or mode in which the flute was intended to function. Lee and Shen believed that the Chinese understood the [...] "resonance of an air column" [...] (see open tube and closed tube) and were able to create an instrument that contained their [...] "complete interval preference of Chinese music". Blowing across the open end of an end-blown bone flute to produce a musical sound, is accomplished in the same way, and produces a similar effect, as blowing across the open top of a bottle. The eight-holed flute can play [...] "all harmonic intervals and two registers." [...] These harmonic intervals are said to be a [...] "function of culture" [...] and were of a larger set compared to that now familiar in the West. Bone flutes were apparently also played as part of sacrificial rites, and employed in bird hunting. Gudi are not very common now, but there are some musicians today who play them.|$|R
5000|$|... flutes are narrow, elongated, straight, {{parallel}} ridges generally {{consisting of}} till, but sometimes composed of sand or silt/clay. Flutes typically reach {{a height of}} only a few meters or less, but some may reach heights of 10 meters (~30 ft.), and may extend up to several kilometers in <b>length.</b> <b>Flutes</b> are oriented parallel to the direction of ice movement, and are formed when boulders become lodged on the subglacial floor by basal melting, and can no longer be moved by the passing glacial ice. The glacial ice must then flow around these boulders, creating elongated cavities in the ice parallel to the ice flow. These cavities in the ice are then filled with water-soaked till, which is squeezed up into the cavities as a result of high confining pressures on the glacier bed from the overlying glacial ice. As a glacier recedes, it exposes these long, low ridges of till. These glacial processes give the topography a [...] "fluted" [...] appearance, giving rise to the name flutes. Flutes can often be traced back to single large boulders embedded in the glacial till.|$|R
50|$|The {{spinning}} frame or water frame {{was developed by}} Richard Arkwright who, along with two partners, patented it in 1769. The design was partly based on a spinning machine built for Thomas High by clockmaker John Kay, who was hired by Arkwright. For each spindle, the water frame used a series of four pairs of rollers, each operating at a successively higher rotating speed, to draw out the fibre, which was then twisted by the spindle. The roller spacing was slightly longer than the fibre length. Too close a spacing caused the fibres to break while too distant a spacing caused uneven thread. The top rollers were leather-covered and loading on the rollers was applied by a weight. The weights kept the twist from backing up before the rollers. The bottom rollers were wood and metal, with <b>fluting</b> along the <b>length.</b> The water frame was able to produce a hard, medium count thread suitable for warp, finally allowing 100% cotton cloth {{to be made in}} Britain. A horse powered the first factory to use the {{spinning frame}}. Arkwright and his partners used water power at a factory in Cromford, Derbyshire in 1771, giving the invention its name.|$|R
5000|$|... 3rd Model - Retaining {{the general}} look of its predecessors, the 3rd model had {{significant}} changes. The {{first was the}} addition of a top strap over the cylinder, which added to the strength of the design. The same mechanism for extracting cartridges was retained. The barrel wedge was eliminated as an unnecessary feature. The scoop flutes were replaced with the more common [...] <b>length</b> <b>flutes</b> for a slight weight savings. The 3rd model could be had in either single-action or double-action. A folding hammer spur was available for those who wished to avoid snagging clothing while drawing the weapon. The 3rd model was produced between 1883 and 1887. 4th Model - The fourth and final model of Frontier began production in 1887. The primary changes from the 3rd model was {{the addition of a}} rib atop the barrel. For the first time, the front sight was a separate component from the barrel, held by a retaining pin. Also for the first time, the Frontier was offered with barrel lengths of [...] or [...] inches in addition to the 'traditional' 7 inch length. Multiple barrels could be purchased and easily swapped out by the owner without tools.|$|R
