Nat., xxxvi. 5) that the Laocoon which {{stood in the}} palace of Titus {{was the work of}} three sculptors, natives of Rhodes; and it is now universally {{admitted}} that the statue which was found (January 14, 1516) in the vineyard of Felice de' Freddi, not far from the ruins of the palace, and is now in the Vatican, is the statue which Pliny describes. M. Collignon, in his Histoire de la Sculpture Grecque, gives reasons for assigning the date of the Laocoon to {{the first years of the}} first century B.C. It follows that the work is a century later than the frieze of the great altar of Pergamos, which contains the figure of a young giant caught in the toils of Athena's serpent--a theme which served as a model for later sculptors of the same school. In 1817 the Laocoon was in the heyday of its fame, and was regarded as the supreme achievement of ancient art. Since then it has been decried and dethroned. M. Collignon protests against this excessive depreciation, and makes himself the mouthpiece of a second and more temperate reaction: [...] "On peut ... gôuter mediocrement le mélodrame, sans méconnaître pour cela les réelles qualités du groupe. La composition est d'une structure <b>irréprochable,</b> d'une harmonie de lignes qui défie toute critique. Le torse du Laocoon trahit une science du nu pen commune" [...] (Hist. de la Sculp. Grecque, 1897, ii. 550, 551).] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{fact that}} The Nordic Historical Review has devoted an issue to {{consumption}} and lifestyle, including {{in all their}} most current forms, might seem surprising. In fact, the Nordic countries have often been considered as among the countries most concerned to display the most complete equality possible among their citizens [...] -thereby reducing the mechanisms of distinction and imitation that manifest through consumption and the affirmation of specific lifestyles. Moreover, the Protestant Ethic that characterizes these countries seems to prevent any tendancy towards conspicuous consumption and promotes a certain strictness of lifestyle and an <b>irreprochable</b> ethic. The “egalitarian temptation ” (Simoulin, 1999, pp. 50 - 52) which has long seemed to characterise these countries, has also given rise to important debates and sometimes to violent criticisms, culminating with Roland Huntford’s book, The New Totalitarians. Perhaps this image has always been rather excessive. After all, it is probably not by accident that {{the very concept of}} “conspicuous comsumption ” was developed in 1899 by an American scholar of Norwegian origin, Thorstein Veblen, in his theory of the leisure class. In fact, we project a sort of image of rigour and asceticism onto Nordic citizens that is probably exagerrated and that, moreover, partially contradicts their image as pioneers of sexual and gender liberation which we attribute to them as well. Although it is a much older image, prior to the Reformation, it is probably worth recalling that the Viking...|$|E
40|$|The {{management}} of the digital image. In the present article the questions implied in the {{management of}} the digital image are exposed on a general way. This supposes to consider so much the formal and logical aspects like the technical aspects, as well as the respective technological implications. The first reflection at the moment for raising the subject happens to clarify the nature of the digital image, essential fact to determine our responsibility like managers of the patrimony. It seems that of natural way it has been integrated to our “photographic” patrimony, although is not unquestionable that its nature includes it of <b>irreprochable</b> way within this category. In any case, the debate is open and they do not lack arguments to consider the digital image within the evolutionary process of the photography or like an appendix of this one. To the margin of those considerations, that although are fundamental do not prevent us to advance in our task, the introduction of the digital image in the contemporary society, and by extension in their centers of memory, implies some significant changes in the management. Tasks like the conservation, the selection and the diffusion, differ in certain aspects of the traditional methodology. If in addition we extend our intention to the implication of the New Technologies in the treatment of the image (photographic or digital), the changes are already of certain magnitude and need an important methodologic revision. The description, the administrative control, the classification and the indexing potentially increase to the possibilities of operation and {{management of the}} bottoms, simultaneously that make the creation inevitable of standards of reference to international level. It is important therefore, to define parameters that facilitate the rules of work to us for an suitable treatment of our bottoms and collections...|$|E
40|$|Prometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012) ha puesto sobre el escenario de la creatividad publicitaria una hasta ahora inédita propuesta online que, apareciendo de forma viral, gradual y creciente, ha generado una expectación exponencial hasta ahora nunca vista en Internet. El poder de estos recursos promocionales ha favorecido notablemente a que un film con un presupuesto de 130 millones de dólares logre ingresar en taquilla casi cuatro veces más (400 millones de dólares). Y a ello ha contribuido sensiblemente el hecho de que, {{entre otras}} muchas cosas, se hayan emitido hasta cuatro versiones distintas del tráiler, con más de 16 millones de descargas del tráiler oficial en YouTube, subido el 22 de diciembre de 2011, seis meses antes de que se estrenara la película en Estados Unidos (6 / 6 / 2012). La presente comunicación analiza estructuralmente cómo, a partir del concepto actual de {{marketing}} viral, Ridley Scott interpela su futuro espectador colando mensajes encriptados, algunos de apariencia perceptiva subliminal, gracias a bocetos previos del film, secuencias que van a ser descartadas, contenidos extra, vídeos colaterales de extrema originalidad (David 8), así como webs simultáneas (sobre Weyland Industries), todo ello bajo una capa estética extraordinariamente sugestiva que hereda interesantes elementos de Alien, el octavo pasajero (1979), un icono <b>irreprochable</b> de la historia del cine. Prometheus (Ridley Scott, 2012) {{has put on}} the stage of advertising creativity a previously unpublished information online that virally appears, gradual and growing exponentially and it has generated an expectation unseen before on the Internet. The promotional power of these resources has led significantly to a film with a budget of 130 million dollars and has collected almost four times (400 million dollars) at the box office. And this has contributed significantly to the fact that this movie has released four different versions of the trailer, with over 16 million downloads of the official trailer on YouTube, uploaded on December 22, 2011, six months before that the film was released in the United States (6 / 6 / 2012). This communication analyzes structurally how, from the current concept of viral marketing, Ridley Scott challenges and seduces his spectator with encrypted messages, subliminal previous sketches of the film, discarded sequences, extra content, original videos (David 8) as well as simultaneous sites (Weyland Industries), all under an extraordinarily attractive atmosphere inherited from Alien (1979), an unbeatable icon of film history...|$|E
