Witnesses reported seeing four of five male students trapping a monkey inside a communal kitchen inside one of the campuses halls of residence.

500|$|More than 750 {{slaves were}} rescued in the Combahee River Raid. Newspapers heralded Tubman's [...] "patriotism, sagacity, energy, [...] ability", {{and she was}} praised for her {{recruiting}} efforts – most of the newly liberated men went on to join the Union army. Tubman later worked with Colonel Robert Gould Shaw at the assault on Fort Wagner, reportedly serving him his last meal. She described the battle by saying: [...] "And then we saw the lightning, {{and that was the}} guns; and then we heard the thunder, and that was the big guns; and then we heard the rain falling, and that was the drops of blood falling; and when we came to get the crops, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> men that we reaped." ...|$|E

500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I just stopped making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{investigation}} by People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, undercover video was obtained of kosher slaughtering practices at a major kosher slaughterhouse run by Agriprocessors in Postville, Iowa. The methods used there involved clamping the animals into a box which is then inverted for slaughter, followed by partial dismemberment of the animal before <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead.</b> Those methods have been condemned as unnecessarily cruel by PETA and others, including Grandin and the Committee on Jewish Law and Standards, but are endorsed by the Orthodox Union, which supervises the slaughterhouse. An investigation by the USDA resulted in some minor operational changes. A lawsuit under Iowa law is pending. Grandin's comment was [...] "I {{thought it was the}} most disgusting thing I'd ever seen. I couldn't believe it. I've been in at least 30 other kosher slaughter plants, and I had never ever seen that kind of procedure done before. ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{partnership}} between McDonnell Douglas and Northrop soured over competition for foreign {{sales for the}} two models. Northrop felt that McDonnell Douglas would put the F/A-18 in direct competition with the F-18L. In October 1979, Northrop filed a series of lawsuits charging that McDonnell was using Northrop technology developed for the F-18L for foreign sales of the F/A-18 in violation of their agreement, {{and asked for a}} moratorium on foreign sales of the Hornet. [...] McDonnell Douglas counter-sued alleging Northrop illegally used F/A-18 technology in its F-20 Tigershark. A settlement was announced 8 April 1985 for all of the lawsuits. McDonnell Douglas paid Northrop $50million for [...] "rights to sell the F/A-18 wherever it could". Additionally, the companies agreed on McDonnell Douglas as the prime contractor with Northrop as the principal sub-contractor. As principal sub-contractor, Northrop will produce the rear section for the F/A-18 (A/B/C/D/E/F) while McDonnell Douglas will produce the rest with final assembly to be performed by McDonnell Douglas. At the time of the settlement Northrop had ceased work on the F-18L. Most export orders for the F18-L were captured by the F-16 or the F/A-18. The Northrop F-20 Tigershark did not enter production and although the program was not officially terminated until 17 November 1986 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>dead</b> by mid-1985.|$|E

60|$|In fact, the {{crocodile}} had received its death-wound.

6000|$|The {{two letters}} that follow, though written {{only a few}} days apart, [...] were {{separated}} in their arrival by a period of seven years.
