5|$|Kepler-6b {{is a hot}} Jupiter, {{having a}} mass 0.669 times that of Jupiter, but an average {{distance}} of only 0.046 AU from <b>its</b> <b>star</b> and, thus, an orbital period of 3.23 days. It is almost 10 times closer to <b>its</b> <b>star</b> than Mercury is from our Sun. As a result, Kepler-6b is strongly irradiated by <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> heating its atmosphere to a temperature of 1660 K and puffing {{it up to a}} size 1.3 times that of Jupiter. It may also be the case that Kepler-6b has a thermal inversion of its atmosphere, where temperature increases with increasing distance {{from the center of the}} planet. However, additional observations are required to confirm or refute this possibility.|$|E
5|$|Because it isn't {{as close}} to <b>its</b> <b>star</b> as its sister planets Kepler-11b and Kepler-11c, the Kepler team {{suggests}} that its light density may come from a large hydrogen and helium atmosphere {{that has not been}} blown away by the stellar wind.|$|E
5|$|Distinguishing {{between these}} two models would require more {{information}} about the planet's radius or composition. The planet does not appear to transit <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> which makes obtaining this information impossible with current observational capabilities.|$|E

5|$|For {{a stable}} orbit the ratio between the moon's orbital period Ps around its primary {{and that of}} the primary around <b>its</b> <b>star</b> Pp must be < 1/9, e.g. if a planet takes 90 days to orbit <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> the maximum stable orbit for a moon of that planet is less than 10 days. Simulations suggest that a moon with an orbital period less than about 45 to 60 days will remain safely bound to a massive giant planet or brown dwarf that orbits 1 AU from a Sun-like star. In the case of Gliese 876 b, the orbital period would have to be no greater than a week (7 days) {{in order to have a}} stable orbit.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d is {{probably}} too massive {{to be made}} only of rocky material. It may have originally formed on a more distant orbit as an icy planet that then migrated closer to <b>its</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|HD 205739 was flagged {{originally}} as {{a candidate}} hosting a Hot Jupiter, which is a large gas giant that orbits closely to <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> although later observations suggested that the planetary candidate orbited further {{out over the next}} 3.5 years of observation.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the planet}} was {{detected}} indirectly through observations of <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> properties {{such as its}} radius, composition, and temperature are unknown. With a mass {{similar to that of}} Saturn, 55 Cancri c {{is likely to be a}} gas giant without a solid surface.|$|E
5|$|After Kepler-40b was confirmed, the French and Swiss science team {{worked to}} clarify the stellar {{parameters}} <b>its</b> <b>star</b> by analyzing the star's spectrum as collected by SOPHIE. Kepler-40 is the sixth known planetary host star with a radius of more than 1.8 {{times that of the}} Sun. At the time of its discovery, Kepler-40 was the most evolved star known to have a transiting planet.|$|E
5|$|As Kepler-8b orbits <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> it {{demonstrates}} the Rossiter–McLaughlin effect, {{in which the}} host star's spectrum becomes red- and, later, blueshifted, as a body transits it. The identification of this effect established Kepler-8b as orbiting in a prograde motion (as opposed to retrograde motion, in which a planet orbits in a direction opposite of its star's rotation).|$|E

50|$|Kepler-16b orbits around <b>its</b> parent <b>stars</b> {{with about}} 14% and 0.5% of the Sun's luminosity, respectively, every 228 {{days at a}} {{distance}} of 0.704 AU from <b>its</b> <b>stars</b> (nearly the same distance that Venus orbits from the Sun, which is about 0.71 AU).|$|R
5|$|HAT-P-33b was {{difficult}} to confirm because <b>its</b> <b>star</b> experiences high jitter, which disrupted the ability to obtain accurate measurements. As such, {{a greater number of}} radial velocity observations were collected to make the confirmation, although it was later determined that HAT-P-33b could not be determined using the radial velocity method. The planet's confirmation came about after the planet's light curve was collected, and the Blendanal process ruled out most false positive scenarios.|$|E
5|$|Having {{discovered}} the planet, the astronomers worked {{to discover a}} transit event using the Infrared Array Camera of the Spitzer Space Telescope, as ground-based observations could prove difficult if Gliese 3634 b was a rocky planet. While the observations did not suggest that Gliese 3634 b transited <b>its</b> <b>star,</b> a few orbital parameters were discovered, yielding the planet's true mass, which cannot be collected solely by radial velocity measurements.|$|E
5|$|In 1984-1985, the Somali {{playwright and}} filmmaker Said Salah Ahmed {{directed}} his first feature film, The Somali Darwish (alt. The Somalia Dervishes), with Amar Sneh serving as producer. With {{a budget of}} $1.8 million, the 4-hour-and-40-minute epic was devoted to the Dervish State.

5|$|It became {{apparent}} to the investigating science team that radial velocity data alone could not prove {{the existence of}} HAT-P-33b. As such, photometric observations of HAT-P-33 were conducted using the Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory's 1.2-meter telescope, which hosted the KeplerCam CCD instrument. This data was used to create the light curve of HAT-P-33. In doing so, a slight dimming was observed where HAT-P-33b was believed to have transited <b>its</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
5|$|Kepler-6 is {{a yellow}} giant {{situated}} in the constellation Cygnus. The star lies {{within the field of}} view of the Kepler Mission, which discovered it as part of a NASA-led mission to discover Earth-like planets. The star, which is slightly larger, more metal-rich, slightly cooler, and more massive than the Sun, is orbited by at least one extrasolar planet, a Jupiter-sized planet named Kepler-6b that orbits closely to <b>its</b> <b>star.</b>|$|E
