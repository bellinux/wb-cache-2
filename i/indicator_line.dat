40|$|Growing soybean cultivars {{that are}} {{resistant}} to the soybean cyst nematode (SCN), Heterodera glycines, is {{an effective way to}} preserve soybean yield and limit increases in population densities of the nematode. The ability of SCN populations to reproduce on germplasm lines that are used in soybean breeding programs to develop SCN-resistant cultivars was measured and classified originally by the race test (Golden et al. 1970; Riggs and Schmitt 1988) and more recently by the HG type test (Niblack et al. 2002). The “HG” represents the first letters in the genus and species names of SCN, Heterodera glycines. Seven different soybean germplasm lines or cultivars that have been registered in a scientific journal currently are the indicator lines in the HG type test. The indicator lines are assigned index numbers 1 through 7, and the ability of an SCN population to reproduce on each of the HG type indicator lines is determined by calculating a female index. The female index is the average number of SCN females produced on the HG type <b>indicator</b> <b>line</b> relative to the number produced on a standard, susceptible soybean cultivar in a 30 -daylong HG type test conducted in a greenhouse (Niblack et al. 2002) ...|$|E
40|$|In many {{neurodegenerative}} disorders, including {{amyotrophic lateral sclerosis}} (ALS), synaptic alterations {{precede the}} demise of the neuronal cell, making synapses a useful vantage point from which to monitor the onset and progression of clinical signs and pathological changes. While murine models of ALS display many features in common with the clinical picture observed in patients, corticospinal tract (CST) involvement is usually less severe in mice than the picture observed in humans. In this paper we describe the characterization of a new conditional transgenic line obtained by targeted integration of a GFP-VAMP 2 fusion gene into the Rosa 26 locus, and devised to permit the detection of genetically defined presynaptic terminals in wild type mice and murine models of neural disorders. This reporter molecule is selectively enriched in presynaptic boutons, significantly reducing the background signal produced by fibers of passage. The specific features of this reporter line allow us to strongly support the view that murine CST terminals give rise to very few direct contacts with spinal motor neurons. Moreover, the evidence described here reveals the existence of previously uncharacterized, putative direct connections between CST presynaptic boutons and Renshaw neurons in the spinal cord. These results constitute a proof of concept for the potential application of this <b>indicator</b> <b>line</b> to morphological analyses of wild-type and diseased synapses...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe Popeye domain {{containing}} (Popdc) genes encode {{a family}} of transmembrane proteins with an evolutionary conserved Popeye domain. These genes are abundantly expressed in striated muscle tissue, however their function is not well understood. In this study we have investigated {{the role of the}} popdc 2 gene in zebrafish. Popdc 2 transcripts were detected in the embryonic myocardium and transiently in the craniofacial and tail musculature. Morpholino oligonucleotide-mediated knockdown of popdc 2 resulted in aberrant development of skeletal muscle and heart. Muscle segments in the trunk were irregularly shaped and craniofacial muscles were severely reduced or even missing. In the heart, pericardial edema was prevalent in the morphants and heart chambers were elongated and looping was abnormal. These pathologies in muscle and heart were alleviated after reducing the morpholino concentration. However the heart still was abnormal displaying cardiac arrhythmia at later stages of development. Optical recordings of cardiac contractility revealed irregular ventricular contractions with a 2 : 1, or 3 : 1 atrial/ventricular conduction ratio, which caused a significant reduction in heart frequency. Recordings of calcium transients with high spatiotemporal resolution using a transgenic calcium <b>indicator</b> <b>line</b> (Tg(cmlc 2 :gCaMP) s 878) and SPIM microscopy confirmed the presence of a severe arrhythmia phenotype. Our results identify popdc 2 as a gene important for striated muscle differentiation and cardiac morphogenesis.

40|$|To produce {{conditional}} expression of {{genes in the}} mouse epidermis we have generated transgenic mouse lines in which the tetracycline-regulated transcriptional transactivators, tTA and rTA, {{are linked to the}} bovine keratin 5 promoter. The transactivator lines were crossed with the tetOlacZ <b>indicator</b> <b>line</b> to test for transactivation in vivo. In the absence of doxycycline, the K 5 /tTA line induced β-galactosidase enzyme activity in the epidermis at a level 500 -fold higher than controls, and oral and topical doxycycline caused a dose- and time-dependent suppression of β-galactosidase mRNA levels and enzyme activity. In the K 5 /rTA lines, doxycycline induced β-galactosidase activity between 3 - and 50 -fold higher depending on the founder line, and this occurred within 24 – 48 [*]h after dosing. Histochemical analysis of all lines localized β-galactosidase expression to the basal layer of the epidermis and the outer root sheath of the hair follicle, as well as other keratin 5 positive tissues. In several K 5 /rTA lines, skin-specific transactivation was restricted to the hair follicle. Treatment of these double transgenic mice with 12 -O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol- 13 -acetate caused rapid migration of β-galactosidase marked cells from the hair follicle through the interfollicular epidermis, demonstrating the usefulness of this specific double transgenic for fate mapping cells in the epidermis. These results show that the tetracycline regulatory system produces effective conditional gene expression in the mouse epidermis, and suggest that it should be amenable to suppression and activation of foreign genes during development and specific pathologic conditions relevant to the epidermis...|$|E
40|$|The {{intent of}} this {{exploratory}} {{study was to}} examine the nature and impact of narcissism in the early career stages of a graduate cohort, where there has previously been little applied narcissism research. Self-reports on self-perception and critical self-insight were obtained individually from 63 new recruits in a multi-national company as part of a graduate recruitment programme. Self-report data were collected on day one of the recruits’ induction programme followed by repeated data collections at nine months and at twenty months into their employment. In addition, at months nine and twenty, two line managers of each recruit completed indicators on their perceptions of the recruits’ actual work performance. Using a newly designed narcissistic traits <b>indicator,</b> <b>line</b> managers also indicated their views of each recruit’s narcissistic tendencies. Results obtained indicated ten of the sixty three graduates had significant narcissistic tendencies. The self-ratings of recruits were subsequently compared to their actual performance as rated by their managers. The self-perceptions of those identified as having narcissistic tendencies were also compared to self-ratings and performance of peers displaying little or no narcissistic tendencies. In both the first and second years of employment, the results indicated that those viewed as having narcissistic tendencies significantly self-enhanced more than the non-narcissists and despite their comparative higher self-rating, narcissists underperformed in their role in comparison to non-narcissists. Narcissists’ self-perception was less consistent over twenty months, indicating a less stable sense of self than the non-narcissists. A critical self-insight (CSI) self-perception gauge was developed for assessing degree and style of self-critique. Although analyses revealed five clusters of sub-scales, the narcissists’ CSI was significantly different from non-narcissists on only one of these clusters; they reported as being less emotive-sensitive than did the non-narcissists. Narcissists were overall less self-critical than non-narcissists. In light of these findings, developmental and environmental influences of narcissism are discussed, along with the effect of such traits both for the hiring organization and for the narcissistic individual within the first 20 months of career induction...|$|E
40|$|As a major {{provision}} {{for more than}} half of the world’s population, rice (Oryza sativa L.) is one of the most important plant species and has great economic importance. Also, rice has been focused on as an excellent model plant for cereal genomics studies due to its following features; 1) the smallest genome size (389 Mb) among the cereal grasses, 2) syntenic relation with other agronomically important Poaceae species such as maize, barley and wheat, 3) available varied resources including a large number of genetic markers, genomic libraries, many mutant lines and retrotransposon tagged lines, 4) there exists well developed technologies for rice genome manipulation such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens -mediated gene transformation and gene targeting with homologous recombination. Consequently, fine quality map-based genome sequencing of rice was completed in 2005. 　　One of the most challenging goals for the plant-research community going forward is to identify the function and regulation of rice genes. Thus, both forward and reverse genetic approaches have been developed to elucidate these functions. However, because the tissue culture process is a necessary step in most of the currently available procedures used in rice genome research, somaclonal variations, which refer to genetic and epigenetic mutations induced by tissue culture, can hamper these approaches. Therefore, a lot of attention has been given to recently identified endogenous DNA transposons that are active under natural growth conditions, a character that is quite useful to development of more efficient rice transposon tagging as a functional genomics tool free from somaclonal variation. 　　One such DNA transposon, nDart 1 - 0 (n on-autonomous D NA-based a ctive r ice t ransposon one-zero) in the hAT superfamily, had been identified as a causative element of spontaneous leaf variegation shown in the mutant line pyl-v (p ale- y ellow- l eaf v ariegated). This mutable phenotype is caused by the disruption and restoration of the nuclear-coded essential chloroplast protease gene, OsClpP 5, due to the insertion and subsequent excision of nDart 1 - 0. As a typical non-autonomous transposon in the hAT superfamily, nDart 1 - 0 can transpose only when the trans -acting transposase is supplied from an autonomous element, aDart (a ctive autonomous Dart). On the other hand, an <b>indicator</b> <b>line,</b> pyl-stb (pyl - st a b le) shows uniform pale-yellow leaves with no nDart 1 - 0 excision due to a lack of an aDart. The result of test crosses between pyl-v and pyl-stb lines indicated that the pyl-v line carries an aDart element in its genome. 　　In the published genomic sequence of the cultivar Nipponbare, there are 38 candidate autonomous Dart elements that have putative transposase genes with no apparent nonsense or frameshift mutations. However, from the result of test crosses with the pyl -stb line, it was shown that Nipponbare carries no aDart elements in its genome. Meanwhile, the excision of some endogenous nDart 1 elements in Nipponbare and pyl- stb was induced by treatment with a DNA methylation inhibitor, 5 -azacytidine. Hence, these lines were predicted to carry epigenetically silenced autonomous elements, iDarts (inactive autonomous Darts). 　　The first aims of this study were identifying the aDart element in the pyl-v line and demonstrating its molecular criteria as an autonomous element. To this end, I performed map-based cloning and revealed that the aDart element in the pyl-v line coincides with one of the 38 candidate autonomous elements, iDart 1 - 27, residing on chromosome 6 in Nipponbare. Also, I have found that all of the examined transcripts of the Dart transposase gene were derived from Dart 1 - 27 in the pyl-v line. These results strongly suggested that Dart 1 - 27 in pyl-v acts on nDart 1 - 0 as an active aDart element. Then, I demonstrated that iDart 1 - 27 cloned from the Nipponbare genome can be converted to an active aDart element in Arabidopsis thaliana plants when its methylation status was eliminated during the cloning process; Dart 1 - 27 excised nDart 1 - 0 as well as itself from the introduced vectors and integrated into various sites of the A. thaliana genome. These results clearly indicated that Dart 1 - 27 is a functional autonomous element, and it is active as an aDart element in the pyl-v line whereas epigenetically silenced as iDart 1 - 27 in Nipponbare. Furthermore, I showed other Dart elements, Dart 1 - 1, Dart 1 - 20, Dart 1 - 28 and Dart 1 - 52 are also functional autonomous elements, but they are epigenetically silenced as iDarts in Nipponbare. 　Next, in order to study if there are any regulatory mechanisms that control the activity of the Dart/nDart system in the pyl-stb line, I introduced Dart 1 - 27 derivatives into the pyl-stb line and evaluated their activity. As a prerequisite for this transgenic approach, I carefully confirmed that during each step of the A. tumefaciens -mediated transformation process the endogenous iDart elements in the pyl-stb genome are almost never activated (0. 1 %). Based on this confirmation, I introduced Dart 1 - 27 derivatives into pyl-stb and demonstrated that they can mobilize nDart 1 - 0 elements from the OsClpP 5 gene as well as from an introduced GUSPlus gene at a high frequency in transgenic pyl-stb plants. This result reconfirmed that Dart 1 - 27 is a functional autonomous element able to act on nDart elements when its methylation status is eliminated, as shown in A. thaliana plants. From the results of phenotypic analysis of transgenic pyl-stb plants, it was suggested that there is a development-dependent regulation of Dart activity in regenerated pyl-stb plants; most of the transgenic pyl-stb plants introduced with Dart 1 - 27 derivatives were the pyl-stb phenotype at their 4 - 6 leaves stage, but almost all of them became the pyl-v phenotype at their 7 - 10 leaves stage. 　　In this manuscript, I have unambiguously demonstrated that the active autonomous element in the pyl-v line is Dart 1 - 27 on chromosome 6 and that the rice genome contains multiple potential autonomous Dart elements silenced epigenetically. From analysis of transgenic pyl-stb plants, I have also indicated a development-dependent regulation that could be a key to further elucidating Dart/nDart regulation mechanisms in the rice genome. I believe these results will facilitate an effective gene tagging system using the Dart/nDart elements in rice...|$|E

Rapid/high isolates grow well in cell lines and induce the formation of syncytia in peripheral blood mononuclear cells.

All SIVsm inoculum viruses and reisolates used CCR 5 {{with a high level of}} efficiency. CCR 5 use was stable over time. BOB and Bonzo use was less efficient than CCR 5 use and, in particular, late isolates obtained at the time of immunodeficiency varied greatly in their coreceptor use and often could not establish a productive infection in BOB- or Bonzo-expressing cells. Unexpectedly, early reisolates obtained 12 days postinfection could infect the entire GHOST(3) panel including the parental cells. In one case this was due to use of CXCR 4, either transfected or endogenously expressed on the GHOST(3) cells. Our results demonstrate the complex coreceptor use of SIVsm isolates.
