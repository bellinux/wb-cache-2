One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go {{up in the air and}} try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we have to do that there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

5000|$|There were brazen {{teachers}} of brazenness {{who thought that}} justice was to do wrong {{on a large scale}} and then {{to be able to make}} it appear that one nevertheless willed the good. Thus they had, so they thought, double advantage, the wretched advantage of being able to do wrong, of being able to have their will, of letting their passions rage, and the hypocritical advantage of seeming to be good. But in ancient times there was also a simple wise man whose simplicity became a trap for the quibbling of the brazen; he taught that in order to be really sure that it was the good one willed, one should avoid even appearing to be good-presumably lest the reward should be tempting. Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, Hong p. 37What is your frame of mind toward others? Are you in harmony with everyone-by willing one thing? Or are you divisively in a faction, or are you at loggerheads with everyone and everyone with you? Do you want for everyone what you want for yourself, or do you want the highest for yourself, for yourself and for yours, or that you and yours shall be highest? Do you do unto others what you want others to do to you-by willing one thing? This willing is the eternal order that orders everything, that brings you in harmony with the dead and with the people you never saw, with strange people whose language and customs you do not know, with all the people on the whole earth, who are blood relatives and eternally related to divinity by eternity's task to will one thing. Do you want a different law for yourself and for yours than for others; <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> your comfort in something different from that in which every human being unconditionally can and will be comforted? If a king and a beggar and one of your peers came to you at the same time, would you in their presence dare with bold confidence to assert what you want in the world, with bold confidence to assert wherein you seek your comfort, positive that his Royal Majesty would not disdain you even though you are an inferior, positive that the beggar would not go away disheartened as if he could not have the same comfort, positive that your peer would rejoice in your bold confidence! Alas, there is something in the world called an alliance; it is a dangerous thing, because all alliances are divisiveness. It is divisive when the alliance excludes the commoner, and when it excludes the nobleman, and when it excludes the government worker, and when it excludes the king, and when it excludes the beggar, and when it excludes the wise, and when it excludes the simple soul-because all alliances are divisiveness in opposition to the universally human. But to will one thing, to will the good in truth, to will as a single individual to be allied with God-something unconditionally everyone can do-that is harmony.

5000|$|One of Emerson's memorable live show stunts with ELP {{involved}} {{playing a}} piano suspended 15 to 20 feet in mid-air and then rotated end-over-end with Emerson sitting at it. This was purely for visual effect, as according to Greg Lake, the piano was fake {{and had no}} works inside. In a 2014 interview with Classic Rock Music journalist Ray Shasho, Emerson {{was asked about the}} origin of the 'flying piano' and about the difficulty of performing while spinning in the air.

You write the best letters. Had a sorta fight with Ginny today and was feeling rather gloomy but when I read your letter, I felt all happy again. Ginny 2 ̆ 6 I are going to come to blows pretty soon. I’m looking for another job now 2 ̆ 6 if I can find {{something}} half way decent, I’ll leave but quickly. Rosemary 2 ̆ 6 I are both looking for another job—I hate to have an arguement [sic] with anyone. Today’s Wednesday 2 ̆ 6 there are only three more days til you’ll be home again. Golly I miss you so much. It does seem months since last Sunday. Yes, I got to bed early Sunday. That’s more than you can say—so there! Do you get much sleep? This weekend we’d better just for a change be wide awake 2 ̆ 6 stop yawning. (Johnny Mercer is playing “You 2 ̆ 6 Your Love”—You should hear it sometime). We had a few snow flakes Monday but nothing exciting. It made me laugh because you had said it had to snow or do something different. What was it like to fly in the snow? I’m very proud of your being able to save 4. 38 by March. You’re really thrifty—(Now he’s playing “Always”—How true). Well, the way things look now I probably will have about two dollars saved by next Christmas—If I get that fur coat especially. What are these “pretty-good-ideas-on-how-to-raise-money ideas” of yours? Well, I was talking to some people about the cost of diamonds 2 ̆ 6 they’re practically an arm 2 ̆ 6 a leg now. Tomorrow I’m going to find out for myself. Going down to Macy’s to look. They’re supposed to have very good junk because they’re all marked 2 ̆ 6 checked by officials or something so that people won’t get gyped [sic]. Daddy can get most jewelery [sic] wholesale 2 ̆ 6 if he could do that it would be wonderful because there probably wouldn’t be a tax on it if he got it. No, honey, there’s {{no doubt in my mind}} at all. And I’ve decided not to try to talk myself out of anything 2 ̆ 6 to just be happy 2 ̆ 6 not worry about anything. When it happens—anything—then maybe I’ll worry about it but not ‘til then. I hope that you can remember all the things we’re going to have a long talk about because there are millions of things that I’ve already forgotten. Yes, we’ve told daddy. He doesn’t want me to get married til the war’s over but if I want to he won’t stand in the way. Besides, even if he didn’t approve I’d do it anyway. Once my mind’s made up it’s pretty hard to change it. Anyway nothing anyone could say about waiting would bother me. If you want to get married in March, we’ll get married in March. Honey, I love you and miss you so much. Just finished dinner 2 ̆ 6 daddy said that he could get rings wholesale. That would be neat. He says they’re about 200 or 250 plus tax. Sinatra’s on now. He’s singing “There Goes That Song Again. ” That reminds me of last Saturday when Henry James played it. Golly so many things happened last Saturday. Golly, there are so many things we have to get settled, honey. I have a fairly good idea of what I’ll have to do between now 2 ̆ 6 March. There are only 38 more shopping days to Christmas. This is going to be some Christmas. Hon, what should I do about telling that fellow? Again that reminds me—Have you been able to get Woody a date for this Saturday? She is so neat. I don’t know what I’d do without her now. She’s been helping me plan stuff. We have more plans. To get back to the subject—I hate to write him but that’s the only way. I guess because if he ever went overseas before I told him it would be awful. Guess writing is the only way. Darling, this Saturday seems so far off. They keep adding extra days in some place during the week. It will be wonderful to be with you again. Maybe we could slow down the clock or something. Time really flies on those weekends. Guess that Gilly 2 ̆ 6 I won’t go to the Pelham-Pleasantville game because we can’t find anyone who’s going. Well, honey, please write soon again. I love you. All my love,Dottie P. S. Please don’t forget about getting Woody a date, honey. Oh, Sinatra is at the Waldorf Astoria or someplace. Maybe we could go there sometime, huh? Where <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the reception? Where did your sisters have theirs? Golly, there are so many questions that I want to ask you. We’re going to have to talk awfully fast to get everything said this weekend. Have you told any of the cadets, yet? So far I’ve only told two girls, of course. I’m practically going crazy but until it’s official or announced anyway, they’re the only ones who’ll know. There are going to be a heck of a lot of people who will be surprised. I’d love to hear what people will say. That would be fun, but I don’t especially care what anyone thinks. Wonder what Don or Bill would say. I’ll bet they won’t believe it. I’d love to see the expression on their faces when they hear about it. Well, honey, goodbye again. I love you 2 ̆ 6 wish that weekends lasted months at a time. Where do you think that you’ll be sent after you get your commission?[Transcription ends...|$|E

40|$|Salesforce helped pioneer {{the concept}} of putting {{confidential}} organizational data in a "public cloud" system.  Other key vendors offering public cloud data services include Microsoft Azure and Amazon S 3 services. "Cloud" has come to mean  many things to many people as far as putting internal office functions up on the Internet. The word “public” is important to understand. This means that all data [...] every corporate and nonprofit user [...] sits in one enormous database. This {{is in fact a}} reassurance, not a drawback. In a public cloud web service, the vendor focuses its security attentions on one system, top to bottom.     Public Clouds and the Apartment Building Analogy   The data system in a public cloud  is "multi-tenant" [...] tenant as in  big apartment building. Even more than in a condo development, an apartment building provides uniform infrastructure supports distributed across all residents. Apartment building tenants in a well-run building can still personalize a unit yet off-load most all concerns for maintenance and infrastructure. Salesforce, for example, manages its 100, 000 customer accounts with something like 20, 000 servers. These servers are located in multiple data centers worldwide each with thousands of servers. A typical hosted website may be secured by the Internet Services Provider, yet it resides in one physical place at a time. In a public cloud system, your data is never just on one server in one data center. There is immense redundancy and optimization so you never need to think about where things are stored and where the next page view is coming from. Likewise, you don 2 ̆ 7 t have to think about doing a back-up. It just happens.     While it still strikes many as challenging to use a public cloud service for storing confidential donor or client lists, we all trust public cloud environments daily. When you use GMail,  Google Docs, Facebook, Flickr, Twitter, you trust your data to a public cloud. In each of these, your data sits, personal or organizational, sits with everyone else’s in one place. For that matter, specialized email manager services like Constant Contact, on-line donation systems, BaseCamp also are public clouds of sorts. Though you only see your own projects, Basecamp or Central Desktop project information sits in the same database as thousands of other customers.   In a cloud environment, everyone logs into one place. Once you log in, you are directed into a compartmentalized set of functions and data and can never see anyone else 2 ̆ 7 s.  The privacy is covered by the user name (email address used to log in) and password. It is up to the vendor to make sure other people’s data doesn’t leak through to your account. What they gain, again, is the ability to manage all security and performance issues in one place.     As with modern network managers, cloud systems typically enable an organizational systems administrator to further govern the user list: you can restrict usage by the location (IP address) a user can use, time of day, and other rules. Cloud environments should make these rules [...] as well as the log in history of each user [...] visible to the system administrator(s) of the account (including you) at all times. The systems also encourage robust passwords and resetting them periodically.     When someone leaves the company/organization, the administrator should be able to simply deactivate their user name. This immediately locks them out. Deactivated users in some system can remain in your account without counting against licensing. This means that records of work and activity remain even after the user is locked out of the system. A bulk transfer of record ownership from a user who has left to a new user is a handy feature to use once the user is de-activated.   Add-on tools to cloud services also need to be secure. Sometimes people ask me if they can “see” their cloud data directly using ODBC, as they might have done with MySQL or SQL Server based traditional websites.  In order to hold things together securely, public cloud services typically ensure that add-ons for email, event registration, as well as your own custom pages use an additional layer of security beyond user name and password. Salesforce, for example, adds a long, apparently random "security token" to encrypted data transfers by add-on tools or pages.     How much security responsibility <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in the era of WIkiLeaks?   Another element of cloud-system security has to do with browser standardization. When you create or update your public website, you can still opt to have the developer support older, unsecure browsers like Internet Explorer 6. The developer won’t be happy, but it can be done. Cloud systems typically set standards for secure browser connections, which may frustrate users on older computer that haven’t updated, yet it adds protection and ensures encryption to the organizational data.     Cloud environments also enable centralized treatment. Every week there are new threats to computer systems. These threats could potentially affect cloud systems, but the difference is, it is cloud vendor’s job to make the patches, and when they do, they do it in one play for all customers. Everywhere else, {{you have to have some}} concern when patches will be applied, who will do it, and whether it will affect your customizations. Cloud vendors like Salesforce focus on pre-announced major upgrade cycles annually and roll them out in organized fashion, while making security patches regularly.   A different security issue concerns how much can we trust a cloud vendor to maintain the confidentiality and privacy of data you entrust to them. This is a consideration with any software any of us uses these days. We live in an era of WikiLeaks, apparent semi-official Chinese theft of Google and Adobe data, Israeli attacks on Iranian nuclear power system networks, and newly intrusive data mining by US authorities.
