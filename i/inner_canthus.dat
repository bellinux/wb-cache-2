5000|$|Epicanthic fold (...) , epicanthal fold, epicanthus, eye fold and {{historically}} Mongolian fold are names for a skin fold {{of the upper}} eyelid, covering the <b>inner</b> corner (medial <b>canthus)</b> of the eye.

There are various factors that influence whether someone has epicanthic folds, including geographical ancestry, age, and certain medical conditions.|$|R
40|$|AIM:To {{study the}} effect of {{different}} surgeries for vision and postoperative complications in leprosy patients with lagophthalmos. METHODS: A retrospective analysis. Totally 68 leprosy patients(97 eyes) with lagophthalmos were selected who treated with different surgeries during May 2007 to September 2015 in our sanatorium. The surgeries included nylon thread correction surgery, tarsorrhaphy, temporalis transposition surgery. We observed and compared the best corrected visual acuity(BCVA) {{and the rate of}} postoperative complications, such as epiphora, lacrimal duct injury, hard to open eyes, infection at the <b>inner</b> and lateral <b>canthus</b> and scar formation of lacrimal apparatus. RESULTS: The effect on BCVA of patients treated with nylon thread correction surgery and tarsorrhaphy: the preoperative and postoperative BCVA was significantly different of the two groups(Z =- 4. 193, - 4. 213; P Z =- 1. 532, P > 0. 05). The postoperative complications:(1) epiphora: there was 91 % in patients underwent nylon thread correction surgery, 89 % in patients underwent tarsorrhaphy, 59 % in patients underwent temporalis transposition surgery, the difference was statistically significant(χ 2 = 12. 198, P χ 2 = 22. 415, P χ 2 = 8. 795, P χ 2 = 60. 858, P CONCLUSION: There are certain clinical efficacy for lagophthalmos caused by leprosy after surgery, especially patients after temporalis transposition surgery can close eyes by oneself. And their vision does not change significantly, which suggests that this surgery may prevent exposure injury for cornea. But the iatrogenic injury, the vision decrease in patients underwent other surgeries and the ocular tissue damage, such as epiphora, lacrimal duct injury, hard to open eyes, infection at the <b>inner</b> and lateral <b>canthus</b> and scar formation of lacrimal apparatus should be pay more attention to...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In In this paper, {{algorithms}} for {{the automatic}} localisation of two anatomical soft tissue landmarks of the head, the medial <b>canthus</b> (<b>inner</b> {{corner of the}} eye) and the tragus (a small, pointed, cartilaginous flap of the ear), in CT images are described. These landmarks are {{to be used as}} a basis for an automated image-to-patient image registration system we are developing. The landmark andmarks are localised on a surface model extracted from CT images, based on surface curvature and a rule based system that incorporates prior knowledge of the landmark characteristics. The approach was tested on a dataset of near isotropic CT images of 95 patients. The position of the automatically localised landmarks was compared to the position of the manually localised landmarks. The average difference was 1. 5 mm and 0. 8 mm for the medial canthus and tragus, with a maximum difference of 4. 5 mm and 2. 6 mm m respectively. The medial canthus and tragus can be automatically localised in i CT images, with performance comparable mparable to manual localisation. M.

40|$|Basal cell {{carcinoma}} {{is a form}} of a non-melanoma skin tumour, that commonly forms over the sun exposed regions of the head and neck. Investigation of the rate of occurrence at different sites on face and neck shows considerable variation from site to site. The <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> has a disproportionate number when compared to more exposed sites. The eye brow ridge, cheek bone and nose limit the field of view of the <b>inner</b> <b>canthus,</b> thus it is expected to receive less radiation than other more exposed regions. To explain the disproportionate rate, it is hypothesised that a portion of radiation incident onto the eye is reflected to the <b>inner</b> <b>canthus.</b> The aim of this thesis is to investigate the contribution that the radiation reflected off the surface of the eye makes to the overall dose on the <b>inner</b> <b>canthus.</b> The inter reflections between the eye and <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> were studied through the use of the ray tracing program Zemax. Zemax was used to trace rays in a non sequential mode incident onto a model eye and periorbital region. To obtain the models of the eye and periorbital region, both magnetic resonance imaging and a casting process was investigated, with the later being superior for our uses.

Methods: A total of 23 patients with acute facial neuritis were enrolled from Department of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, Chinese PLA General Hospital. Another 21 healthy participants were selected as the control group. Focal plane thermal imaging system (thermal sensitivity 0. 05 ℃) was applied to collect facial far-infrared thermogram. Temperature differences in the thermogram of {{both sides of the}} cheeks, <b>inner</b> <b>canthus,</b> supraorbitals and forehead of the same patient were compared separately and statistically and analyzed by software provided by the imaging system. Results: Results of far-infrared thermography of the patients displayed obvious temperature differences ranging from 0. 01 to 0. 26 ℃ between two sides of the cheeks, <b>inner</b> <b>canthus,</b> supraorbitals and forehead areas. In the control group, far-infrared thermogram showed that there were no obvious temperature differences between two sides of the cheeks, <b>inner</b> <b>canthus,</b> supraorbitals and forehead.

40|$|AbstractObjective: To measure {{movements}} of markers over the primary site and associated mimic muscles in certain facial expressions, for evaluating facial paresis and synkinesis. Methods: Participants included 22 normal subjects aged 45 – 66 years. Maximum shift (Smax) and velocity (Vmax) were measured using a custom-designed 3 -D dynamic quantitative analysis system of facial motion (3 -D ASFM) based on motion capture technology. Measures {{were taken from}} peri-oral muscles during forceful brow raising and tight eye closure, and from muscles around the eye during grinning, right/left/bilateral mouth corner raising and smiling. Results: 1) During forceful brow raising, Smax was 3. 65 – 4. 46  mm for markers over perioral muscles, with the marker over the nasolabial fold showing a Vmax greater than others (60. 60  mm/s on left and 62. 70  mm/s on right). 2) In tight eye closure, Smax of perioral muscle markers was 1. 58 – 1. 92  mm, with Vmax being 11. 40 – 14. 76  mm/s. 3) In grinning, the largest eye muscle marker Smax was seen at the lower lid (3. 93  mm on left and 4. 15  mm on right) and the smallest at the <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> (1. 59  mm on left and 1. 53  mm on right), with the largest Vmax seen at the upper lid and smallest also at the <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> (11. 71  mm/s on left and 11. 09  mm/s on right). 4) In smiling, the largest non-oral Smax and Vmax were seen at the upper lid (3. 05  mm and 36. 14  mm/s on left and 2. 53  mm and 28. 90  mm/s on right) and the smallest also at the <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> (0. 69  mm and 7. 22  mm/s on left and 0. 77  mm and 7. 80  mm/s on right). 5) In right mouth corner raising, Smax and Vmax at lateral and medial canthus and at lower lid were greater on right than left, while those at upper lid and brow were slightly greater on left than right. 6) In left mouth corner raising, Smax and Vmax at lateral canthus and upper and lower lids were greater on left than right. Conclusions: There are no absolute immobile points on the face when making facial expressions.

The aim was to quantify {{the upper and lower}} facial muscle function in patients with hemispheric stroke. Three different facial expressions (forced smile, posed smile and maximum eyebrow lift) and facial rest position were mapped using a 3 D video system. Twenty-seven patients with hemispheric stroke (PG) and 22 controls (CG) were recruited. Facial asymmetry was expressed as absolute side differences between four corresponding distances. In PG, a longer distance was found from <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> to oral commissure (dist 1) on the impaired side in all investigated poses (PG non-affected-affected side: range of all poses 1 · 18 ± 4 · 45 to 1 · 80 ± 2 · 37 mm; CG right-left side: range - 0 · 69 ± 1 · 55 to - 0 · 43 ± 1 · 39 mm, Mann-Whitney tests: 0 · 0002 < P < 0 · 0423). In addition, the ratio of the impaired to the non-affected side was different in PG for dist 1 in rest and eyebrow lift (Wilcoxon tests: 0 · 0011 < P < 0 · 0288). CG showed asymmetries in rest and forced smile (Wilcoxon tests: P = 0 · 0392 and P = 0 · 0424). Furthermore, dist 1 in PG showed higher variances than in CG (F-tests: 0 · 0001 < P < 0 · 0445) except for the relative dist 1 at rest (F-test: P = 0 · 0533). The distance between inner eyebrow corner and <b>inner</b> <b>canthus</b> showed no side difference in both groups during eyebrow lift (n. s.); nevertheless, two patients showed distinct asymmetries.
