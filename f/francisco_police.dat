5|$|In the past, Adrian Monk (Tony Shalhoub) was a San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> Department's investigator, but {{the death}} of his wife, Trudy, led him to develop depression, obsessiveâ€“compulsive {{disorder}} and multiple phobias.

He was also investigated for another murder in Arizona.|$|E
5|$|The gay {{community}} of San Francisco had a longstanding {{conflict with the}} San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> Department. White's status as a former police officer intensified the community's anger at the SFPD. Initial demonstrations took place as a peaceful march through the Castro district of San Francisco. After the crowd arrived at the San Francisco City Hall, violence began. The events caused {{hundreds of thousands of}} dollars' worth of property damage to City Hall and the surrounding area, as well as injuries to police officers and rioters.|$|E
50|$|His {{first months}} in office were {{relatively}} calm. He kept tabs on city spending and made few public appearances, save to dedicate the city's first streetcar line. He also doubled the size of San <b>Francisco's</b> <b>police</b> force. While Teschemacher was Mayor of San Francisco, the American Civil War erupted: San Francisco coped with disrupted trade with the East by buying stock in silver mines and establishing factories that sold goods not only within the city itself but also in Asia, beginning San Francisco's path to economic self-sufficiency.|$|R

5|$|Congressman Phillip Burton, Assemblyman Willie Brown, {{and other}} California {{politicians}} recognized the growing clout {{and organization of}} homosexuals in the city, and courted their votes by attending meetings {{of gay and lesbian}} organizations. Brown pushed for legalization of sex between consenting adults in 1969 but failed. SIR was also pursued by popular moderate Supervisor Dianne Feinstein in her bid to become mayor, opposing Alioto. Ex-policeman Richard Hongisto worked for 10 years to change the conservative views of the San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> Department, and also actively appealed to the gay community, which responded by raising significant funds for his campaign for sheriff. Though Feinstein was unsuccessful, Hongisto's win in 1971 showed the political clout of the gay community.|$|E
5|$|Despite the new {{leadership}} in the city, there were still conservative strongholds. One of Moscone's first acts as mayor was appointing a police chief to the embattled San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> Department (SFPD). He chose Charles Gain, against {{the wishes of the}} SFPD. Most of the force disliked Gain for criticizing the police in the press for racial insensitivity and alcohol abuse on the job, instead of working within the command structure to change attitudes. By request of the mayor, Gain made it clear that gay police officers would be welcomed in the department; this became national news. Police under Gain expressed their hatred of him, and of the mayor for betraying them.|$|E

5|$|Two weeks later, San Francisco taxicab driver Paul Stine is {{shot and}} killed in the city's Presidio Heights {{district}} immediately after dropping the killer off. The Zodiac killer mails pieces of Stine's blood stained shirt to the Chronicle, along with a taunting letter. San <b>Francisco</b> <b>police</b> detectives Dave Toschi and his partner Bill Armstrong are assigned to the Stine case, and work closely with Vallejo's Jack Mulanax and Captain Ken Narlow in Napa. The killer, or someone posing as him, continues to toy with authorities by sending more letters and speaks {{on the phone with}} lawyer Melvin Belli when he makes an appearance on a television talk show. Avery and Graysmith form an alliance, delving deeper into the case as time permits.|$|E
5|$|In 1978, Avery {{leaves the}} Chronicle, {{and moves to}} the Sacramento Bee. Graysmith {{persistently}} contacts Toschi about the Zodiac murders, and eventually impresses the veteran detective with his knowledge of the case. While Toschi cannot directly give Graysmith access to the evidence, he provides contact names of other police departments in other counties where Zodiac murders occurred. Armstrong transfers from the San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> homicide division, and Toschi is demoted for supposedly forging a Zodiac letter. Graysmith continues his own investigation, which is profiled in the Chronicle, and he allows himself to be interviewed on television about his book-in-progress concerning the case. He begins receiving anonymous phone calls with heavy breathing. Because of his immersion in the case, Graysmith loses his job and his wife Melanie leaves him, taking their children with her. Graysmith acquires more information that points to Allen as the Zodiac, and although circumstantial evidence seems to indicate his guilt, the physical evidence, such as fingerprints and handwriting samples, do not implicate him.|$|E

25|$|Because the City and County of San Francisco are {{consolidated}} and coterminousâ€”the only consolidated {{city and}} county in Californiaâ€”the San Francisco Sheriff historically possessed law enforcement authority. However, as the San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> Department provides general police service for the city, the Sheriff's Department handles judicial duties, staffs the jail, and provides law enforcement services for city facilities such as San Francisco City Hall and San Francisco General Hospital. San Francisco Sheriff's deputies back up the San <b>Francisco</b> <b>Police</b> as needed, as well as make arrests for criminal and vehicle-code violations while performing their duties.|$|E
