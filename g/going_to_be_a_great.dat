500|$|Harrison {{studied the}} {{instrument}} until 1968, when, following {{a discussion with}} Shankar {{about the need to}} find his [...] "roots", an encounter with Clapton and Hendrix at a hotel in New York convinced him to return to guitar playing. Harrison commented: [...] "I decided... I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> sitar player... because I should have started at least fifteen years earlier." [...] Harrison continued to use Indian instrumentation occasionally on his solo albums and remained strongly associated with the genre. Lavezzoli groups him with Paul Simon and Peter Gabriel as the three rock musicians who have given the most [...] "mainstream exposure to non-Western musics, or the concept of 'world music'".|$|E
500|$|Having {{left the}} conservatoire, Offenbach was {{free from the}} stern academicism of Cherubini's curriculum, but as the biographer James Harding writes, [...] "he was free, also, to starve." [...] He secured a few {{temporary}} jobs in theatre orchestras before gaining a permanent appointment in 1835 as a cellist at the Opéra-Comique. He was no more serious there {{than he had been}} at the conservatoire, and regularly had his pay docked for playing pranks during performances; on one occasion, he and the principal cellist played alternate notes of the printed score, and on another they sabotaged some of their colleagues' music stands to make them collapse in mid-performance. Nevertheless, his earnings from his orchestral work enabled him to take lessons with the celebrated cellist Louis-Pierre Norblin. He made a favourable impression on the composer and conductor Fromental Halévy, who gave him lessons in composition and orchestration and wrote to Isaac Offenbach in Cologne that the young man was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> composer. Some of Offenbach's early compositions were programmed by the fashionable conductor Louis Antoine Jullien. Offenbach and another young composer Friedrich von Flotow collaborated on a series of works for cello and piano. Although Offenbach's ambition was to compose for the stage, he could not gain an entrée to Parisian theatre at this point in his career; with Flotow's help, he built a reputation composing for and playing in the fashionable salons of Paris.|$|E
500|$|In May 2011, it was {{announced}} that Spears would headline Summerfest on July 9, 2011, at the Marcus Amphitheater in Milwaukee. She previously headlined the festival on July 8, 2000, during the Oops!... I Did It Again World Tour, and had to cancel her performance during The Onyx Hotel Tour in 2004 due to a knee injury. Summerfest's entertainment director Bob Babisch said, [...] "It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> dance party. [...] This {{is going to be the}} biggest production we've ever put in the Marcus Amphitheatre. There's a thrust that goes out on the stage about 80 feet, and it's about 80 feet wide, and there's all kinds of things flying in and out." [...] The European tour dates were announced on her official website on June 5, 2011. On July 25, 2011, Spears announced through her Ustream page at 18:00 EST (23:00 UTC) a South American leg of the tour. Accompanied by two of her dancers— one translating in Spanish and the other in Portuguese— she also apologized for not touring in the region during The Circus Starring Britney Spears in 2009. A notice following the stream announced the first two dates in Brazil and ten more dates to be announced in the near future. It will mark Spears first concert in Brazil in ten years, since her 2001 performance at Rock in Rio. During the next few days, concerts in countries such as Argentina, Chile, Colombia and Peru were announced. On September 26, 2011, it {{was announced}} that Spears would perform on the first day of the Abu Dhabi Grand Prix.|$|E

2500|$|Although rookie hazing was customary, Cobb {{could not}} endure it in good humor and soon became alienated from his teammates. He later {{attributed}} his hostile temperament to this experience: [...] "These old-timers turned {{me into a}} snarling wildcat." [...] Tigers manager Hughie Jennings later acknowledged that Cobb was targeted for abuse by veteran players, some of whom sought to force him off the team. [...] "I let this go for a while because I wanted to satisfy myself that Cobb has as much guts as I thought in the very beginning", Jennings recalled. [...] "Well, he proved it to me, and I told the other players to let him alone. He is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> baseball player and I won't allow him to be driven off this club." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lastly, in {{the late}} 1990s, a new Internet fad began, owing to simplistic {{software}} development kits such as the Japanese RPG Maker series (1988 onwards). Influenced by console RPGs and based mostly on the gameplay and style of the SNES and Sega Genesis games, {{a large group of}} young programmers and aficionados across the world began creating independent console-style computer RPGs and sharing them online. An early successful example was Corpse Party (1996), a survival horror indie game created using the RPG Maker engine. Much like the survival horror adventure games Clock Tower (1995 onwards) and later Haunting Ground (2005), the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings. However, the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011. In an interview with GameDaily in 2007, MTVN's Dave Williams remarked that, [...] "Games like this [...] have been sort of under the radar for something that could be the basis of a business. We have the resources and we can afford to invest more... I think it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> thing for the consumer." ...|$|E

Rousseau showed a demo of [...] "Stand Amid the Roar" [...] to the band and that was [...] "all it took {{for him to get}} in the band!", as Told revealed. [...] "On Brave Mountains We Conquer", and its {{counterpart}} [...] "In Silent Seas We Drown", are the most autobiographical songs on the album. [...] "On Brave Mountains We Conquer" [...] also talks about settling down and giving up one's dreams. The lyrics of [...] "Massachusetts" [...] refer to an abusive relationship and the problems one faces with it. The band nearly thought about not recording the song due to its similarity to another Silverstein song. As a compromise, the group [...] "changed it around slightly" [...] according to Told. The tracks [...] "This Is How" [...] and [...] "The Wind Shifts" [...] were written and recorded at the same time. Told notes that they are a summary of the album and that they [...] "symbolize how similar everyone is regardless of how different they seem externally." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1998, Cousins was {{selected}} in the All-Australian Team and was runner-up in West Coast's Best and Fairest. He played in his first AFL finals game in 1999, against the Western Bulldogs in a qualifying final at the MCG, and the year included another selection in the All-Australian Team and representing Australia in the International Rules Series. In 2000, Cousins signed a new three-year contract with the West Coast Eagles, reportedly worth nearly A$1million. He played his 100th game amid speculation he would take over the captaincy from Guy McKenna, who was due to retire after the same game. Cousins said, [...] "After you play two or three seasons, {{you think of the}} possibility of a leadership role down the track, but the talk of it has certainly come a lot earlier than I would have thought." [...] In 2001, Cousins was named co-captain, sharing the role with Dean Kemp. He won his first club Best and Fairest {{at the end of the}} season, a feat which he repeated in 2002 and 2003, and he was again named in the All-Australian Team in 2001 and 2002. Kemp's retirement saw Cousins become the captain in 2002, a role he filled until 2006. In 2005, West Coast coach John Worsfold said of Cousins' fifth year as captain, [...] "Ben is improving all the time and with the way this group is coming along, I think he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>great</b> leader".|$|E
