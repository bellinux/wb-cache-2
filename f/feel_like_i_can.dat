They recorded together in the studio in January 2009, and according to Furler's blog the duo wrote four songs together during the sessions. Members of British electronic band Ladytron, Daniel Hunt and Reuben Wu, went to Los Angeles to meet Aguilera in December 2008 after hearing that they were one of her favorite bands. During the meeting, Aguilera identified what kind of Ladytron songs she liked, with Hunt later saying, [...] "We were impressed because she had a real deep knowledge of our music – album tracks, not just the singles!". Ladytron said following about the sessions with the singer, [...] "We went in with no expectations; the whole thing was a massive surprise. But it was incredible. She was so musically talented, a vocalist who really knows her voice. The first takes sounded really amazing, and while we'd made demos, it was only when her voice was on them that it all came to life."

40|$|Introduction and Aims: The aim of {{this study}} was to compare motives for alcohol {{consumption}} when alcohol is mixed with energy drinks (AMED) or mixed with other non-alcoholic beverages (AMO). Design and Methods: Data from the Utrecht Student Survey [1] was used to analyse motives for alcohol consumption of 1239 AMED consumers. Using within-subject comparisons, 13 neutral or negative motives for AMED and AMO consumption were compared. Results: Most frequently endorsed motives for consumption of AMED versus AMO were “I like the taste” (81. 1 % vs. 90. 2 %) (5. 4 vs. 4. 5), “I wanted to drink something else” (35. 5 % vs. 42. 9 %), and “To celebrate a special occasion, party” (14. 6 % vs. 14. 9 %). Negative reasons were endorsed by a minority of students. No significant differences were found for AMED versus AMO on the motives “It <b>feels</b> <b>like...</b> reduces the negative effects of alcohol” (6. 9 % vs. 5. 1 %), “It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> drink more alcohol” (5. 6 % vs. 6. 5 %). Energy drinks were significantly less often consumed “To get drunk” (8. 0 vs. 10. 9 %), “To prevent getting drunk” (3. 8 % vs. 9. 0 %) or “To sober up” (2. 9 vs. 6. 0 %). Discussion and Conclusions: No relevant differences in motives for mixing alcohol with energy drink or other non-alcoholic beverages were observed. Only a small minority of students has negative motives for alcohol consumption...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: A UK student survey {{examined}} the motivations for consuming energy drinks alone and mixed with alcohol, and aimed {{to determine whether}} the type of motive had a differential effect on overall alcohol consumption. Methods: The online survey (N = 1873) assessed alcohol consumption and motivations for consumption when mixed with energy drinks (AMED) and mixed with other non-alcoholic beverages (AMOB) using a within-subject design. Results: The most frequent neutral motives reported for AMED consumption included "I like the taste" (66. 5 %), and "to celebrate a special occasion" (35. 2 %). 52. 6 % of AMED consumers reported consuming AMED for at least one of five negative motives, primarily "to get drunk" (45. 6 %). Despite these negative motives those students reported consuming significantly less alcohol and fewer negative alcohol-related consequences on AMED occasions compared to alcohol-only (AO) occasions. Although the motives for consuming AMED and AMOB were comparable, more participants reported consuming AMED "to celebrate a special occasion", "to get drunk", because they "received the drink from someone else" or "because others drink it as well". However, significantly more students reported consuming AMOB than AMED because "It <b>feels</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>can</b> drink more alcohol". Alcohol consumption was significantly less on AMED occasions compared to AMOB occasions, and both occasions significantly less than AO occasions. Conclusion: The majority of reasons for consuming AMED relate to neutral motives. Although 52. 6 % of students reported one or more negative motives for AMED consumption (predominantly "to get drunk") this had no differential effect on total alcohol consumption. The differences in motives suggest AMED is consumed more to enjoy special occasions and as a group-bonding experience, however alcohol consumption is significantly lower on such occasions in comparison to when AMOB or AO are consumed...|$|R
