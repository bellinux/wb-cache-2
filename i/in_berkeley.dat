40|$|Almost all {{who write}} on Collier note a {{striking}} similarity between a short passage in his Clavis Universalis {{and the famous}} claim that esse is percipi <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> Principles. This essay explores that similarity in more detail than has been done before. The comparison forces us to address an issue {{about the nature of}} passivity <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> theory of mind. Two interpretations consistent with the text are offered and one is favoured {{on the grounds that it}} makes some of Berkeley's arguments more plausible. The idealisms of Berkeley and Collier are shown to have a common source...|$|R

5|$|After {{receiving}} his PhD {{from the}} University of Chicago in 1936, Alvarez {{went to work}} for Ernest Lawrence at the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley.</b> Alvarez devised a set of experiments to observe K-electron capture in radioactive nuclei, predicted by the beta decay theory but never before observed. He produced tritium using the cyclotron and measured its lifetime. In collaboration with Felix Bloch, he measured the magnetic moment of the neutron.|$|E
5|$|After the August 1943 Quebec Agreement merged the British and American {{atomic bomb}} projects, Mark Oliphant persuaded the Admiralty to release Massey {{to work on}} the Manhattan Project. In November 1943, Massey set out with Oliphant for the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley</b> in a B-24 Liberator bomber. The Radiation Laboratory's part was to develop an {{electromagnetic}} isotope separation process. Massey was in charge of its Theoretical Group, which included American David Bohm and Australian Eric Burhop. They studied the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields, today known as Bohm diffusion, and studied the ionization of uranium compounds used as feed in the electromagnetic uranium enrichment process such as uranium tetrachloride (UCl4) and uranium hexafluoride (UF6). Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley</b> by Massey. Wartime papers produced by the group were collected and published in The Characteristics of Electrical Discharges in Magnetic Fields (1949).|$|E

5|$|Californium {{was first}} {{synthesized}} at the University of California Radiation Laboratory <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> by the physics researchers Stanley G. Thompson, Kenneth Street, Jr., Albert Ghiorso, and Glenn T. Seaborg {{on or about}} February 9, 1950. It was the sixth transuranium element to be discovered; the team announced its discovery on March 17, 1950.|$|E
5|$|From 1924 to 1928 he {{attempted}} without success to find employment {{as a civil}} engineer in California, where his father was now stationed. Instead he worked as an apprentice and journeyman boilermaker with the Steel Tank and Pipe Company <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> California. Advances in aviation in the 1920s led Hansell to undertake a career in aeronautical engineering, and to gain flying experience, he decided to join the United States Army Air Corps.|$|E
5|$|Green Day was {{originally}} {{part of the}} punk scene at the DIY 924 Gilman Street club <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> California. The band's early releases were with the independent record label Lookout! Records. In 1994, their major label debut Dookie, released through Reprise Records, became a breakout success and eventually shipped over 10 million copies in the U.S. Green Day is credited alongside fellow California punk bands including Sublime, Bad Religion, the Offspring, and Rancid with popularizing mainstream interest in punk rock in the United States.|$|E
50|$|In 1882 the British Journal of Photography Almanac {{included}} his new {{formula of}} pyrogallol, sulfite and citric acid in their publication. <b>In</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> new formula, just before use, ammonia {{was added to}} make it more alkaline.|$|R
50|$|Returning {{to service}} <b>in</b> 1795, <b>Berkeley</b> {{commanded}} HMS Formidable off Brest, Cadiz, Ireland and the Texel, coming ashore in 1798 {{to command the}} Sussex sea fencibles. <b>In</b> 1799, <b>Berkeley</b> was promoted rear-admiral and attached to the Channel Fleet, but the gout which had forced his first retirement returned, and Berkeley was forced to take permanent shore leave in 1800. <b>In</b> 1801, <b>Berkeley</b> increased his political interests {{to compensate for the}} loss of his naval career.|$|R

5|$|Mayfair {{has had a}} long {{association}} with the United States. Pocahontas is believed to have visited the area in the early 17th century. In 1786, John Adams established the US Embassy on Grosvenor Square. Theodore Roosevelt was married in Hanover Square, while Franklin D. Roosevelt honeymooned <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley</b> Square. There is a small memorial park in Mount Street Gardens with a collection of benches engraved with the names of former American residents and visitors to Mayfair.|$|E
5|$|Members of the British mission {{occupied}} {{several key}} {{positions in the}} electromagnetic project. Oliphant became Lawrence's de facto deputy, and {{was in charge of}} the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory when Lawrence was absent. His enthusiasm for the electromagnetic project was rivalled only by Lawrence's, and his involvement went beyond scientific problems, extending to policy questions such as whether to expand the electromagnetic plant, although in this he was unsuccessful. The British chemists made important contributions, particularly Harry Emeléus and Philip Baxter, a chemist who had been research manager at ICI, was sent to the Manhattan Project's Clinton Engineering Works at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, in 1944 in response to a request for assistance with uranium chemistry, and became personal assistant to the general manager. His status as an ICI employee was of no concern to Groves. The British mission was given complete access to the electromagnetic project, both <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley</b> and at the Y-12 electromagnetic separation plant in Oak Ridge. While some of the British mission remained at Berkeley or Oak Ridge only for a few weeks, most stayed until the end of the war. Oliphant returned to Britain in March 1945, and was replaced as head of the British mission <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley</b> by Massey.|$|E

50|$|Berkeley meant this 'aether' to {{supplant}} Newton's gravity {{as the cause}} of motion (neither seeing the polarity involved between two forces, as Cudworth had in his plastic principle). However, <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> conception, aether is both the movement of spirit and the motion of nature.|$|R

5|$|Neptunium (named for {{the planet}} Neptune, the next planet out from Uranus, after which uranium was named) was {{discovered}} by Edwin McMillan and Philip H. Abelson in 1940 <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> California. They produced the 239Np isotope (half-life = 2.4 days) by bombarding uranium with slow neutrons. It was the first transuranium element produced synthetically.|$|E
5|$|Priscilla Greene {{was born}} <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> California, on April 8, 1918, {{and grew up}} in Corning, California. She entered the University of California, from which she {{obtained}} a degree in political science. After graduation, she studied and travelled in New York and Europe before returning to Berkeley, where she got a job as secretary to Ernest O. Lawrence, the director of the Radiation Laboratory at the University of California, in February 1942, replacing Helen Griggs, who had left to marry Glenn Seaborg.|$|E
5|$|To review {{this work}} and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened {{meetings}} at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley,</b> in July with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.|$|E
5000|$|For example, David Sherry {{argues that}} Berkeley's {{criticism}} of infinitesimal calculus {{consists of a}} logical criticism and a metaphysical criticism. The logical criticism {{is that of a}} fallacia suppositionis, which means gaining points in an argument by means of one assumption and, while keeping those points, concluding the argument with a contradictory assumption. The metaphysical criticism is a challenge to the existence itself of concepts such as fluxions, moments, and infinitesimals, and is rooted <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> empiricist philosophy which tolerates no expression without a referent [...] Andersen (2011) showed that Berkeley's doctrine of the compensation of errors contains a logical circularity. Namely, Berkeley relies upon Apollonius's determination of the tangent of the parabola <b>in</b> <b>Berkeley's</b> own determination of the derivative of the quadratic function.|$|R
25|$|Poe {{graduated}} from Wichita Southeast High School in 1980 and earned his B.A. in 1984 at Grinnell College {{where he was}} named outstanding student in history.
