5|$|At {{the party}} that evening, Boq tries to tell Nessarose the real reason he invited her, but is unable to hurt her feelings. She is {{becoming}} infatuated with him. Madame Morrible arrives to tell Galinda that she can join her sorcery class, at Elphaba's request. Elphaba herself arrives, wearing the hat Galinda gave her, a witch's hat. The other students laugh and stare while Elphaba awkwardly dances on her own. Galinda feels terrible, and goes to dance with Elphaba. Soon everyone joins them, and the two girls {{look at each other}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b>|$|E

The memorial, a large steel fragment from the World Trade Center ruins, was officially unveiled in September 2013.|$|E
25|$|Badiou's {{ultimate}} ethical maxim {{is therefore}} one of: 'decide upon the undecidable'. It is {{to name the}} indiscernible, the generic set, and thus name the event that re-casts ontology <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b> He identifies four domains in which a subject (who, {{it is important to}} note, becomes a subject through this process) can potentially witness an event: love, science, politics and art. By enacting fidelity to the event within these four domains one performs a 'generic procedure', which in its undecidability is necessarily experimental, and one potentially recasts the situation in which being takes place. Through this maintenance of fidelity, truth has the potentiality to emerge.|$|E

25|$|The {{peculiar}} {{nature of}} Casaubon's will leads to suspicion that Ladislaw and Dorothea are lovers, creating awkwardness between the two. Ladislaw is secretly {{in love with}} Dorothea but keeps this to himself, having no desire to involve her in scandal or to cause her disinheritance. He remains in Middlemarch, working as a newspaper editor for Mr Brooke. When Brooke's election campaign collapses, he decides to leave the town and visits Dorothea to say his farewell. But Dorothea has also {{fallen in love with}} Ladislaw, whom she had previously seen only as her husband's unfortunate relative. However, the peculiar nature of Casaubon's will has led her to see him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b> Renouncing Casaubon's fortune, she shocks her family again by announcing that she will marry Ladislaw. At the same time, Fred, who has been successful in his new career, marries Mary.|$|E
500|$|Ahalya {{has been}} {{examined}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light</b> by several modern writers, most commonly through short stories or through poetry in various Indian languages. Although Ahalya {{is a minor}} character in all ancient sources, [...] "stigmatised and despised by those around her" [...] for violating gender norms, modern Indian writers have elevated her {{to the status of}} an epic heroine, rather than an insignificant figure in the saga of Rama. However, in modern devotional Ramayana adaptations where Rama is the hero, the redemption of Ahalya continues to be a supernatural incident in his life.|$|E
500|$|If Bell Nicholls {{was a poor}} unknown curate in England – in Banagher he was {{a member}} of a respectable family. In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: [...] "My dear husband, too, appears <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light</b> in his own country. More than once I have had deep {{pleasure}} in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that I have got one of the best gentlemen in the country .... I trust I feel thankful to God for having enabled me to make what seems a right choice; and I pray to be enabled to repay as I ought the affectionate devotion of a truthful, honourable man." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{the success}} of Milford's biography, {{scholars}} and critics began to look at Zelda's work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b> In a 1968 edition of Save Me the Waltz, F. Scott Fitzgerald scholar Matthew Bruccoli wrote, [...] "Save Me the Waltz is worth reading partly because anything that illuminates the career of F. Scott Fitzgerald is worth reading—and {{because it is the}} only published novel of a brave and talented woman who is remembered for her defeats." [...] But as Save Me the Waltz was increasingly read alongside Milford's biography, a new perspective emerged. In 1979, scholar Jacqueline Tavernier-Courbin wrote rebutting Bruccoli's position: [...] "Save Me the Waltz is a moving and fascinating novel which should be read on its own terms equally as much as Tender Is the Night. It needs no other justification than its comparative excellence." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1917, Macmillan {{spoke out}} against the {{practice}} of assigning a woman's national citizenship depending on whom she married. From 1905, this had been the vocal position of Ishbel Hamilton-Gordon, Marchioness of Aberdeen and Temair, known as Lady Aberdeen, but Macmillan saw the issue <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light</b> during the war. Women who were married to foreigners were, upon declaration of war, faced suddenly with status as enemy nationals within the land of their birth. From the same legal basis, a number of British women were enjoying full citizenship in enemy territories. Macmillan was in favour of women retaining their existing citizenship through marriage. To that end, she wrote a piece entitled [...] "The Nationality of Married Women" [...] that was published twice in Jus Suffragii, once in July 1917 and again with updated statistics in June 1918. However, no new laws were passed about it, and a woman's citizenship remained tied to that of her husband.|$|E
500|$|Before he {{shot his}} own head-smashing scene, {{he spoke to}} Gaspar Noé and {{asked him how he}} had done a similar scene in his film Irréversible (2002). Crossing the line from romance to violence, the scene begins with the Driver and Irene kissing tenderly. What they share is really a goodbye kiss, as he then becomes a [...] "werewolf," [...] violently stomping the hit man's head in. Subsequently, Irene sees the Driver <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b> Of this scene Refn said: Every movie has to have a hearta place where it defines itselfand in every movie I've made there's always a scene that does that. On Drive, {{it was hard for me}} to wrap my head around it. I {{realized}} I needed to show in one situation that driver is the hopelessly romantic knight, but he's also completely psychotic and is willing to use any kind of violence to protect innocence. But that scene was never written. As I was going along, it just kind of popped up. In March 2012, Interiors, an online journal that is concerned with the relationship between architecture and film, released an issue that discussed how space is used in this scene. The issue highlights Refn's use of constricted space and his way of creating a balance between romance and violence.|$|E

2500|$|Although {{some authors}} of the 19th and the early 20th century {{regarded}} him as a [...] "wicked thief and assassin" [...] or a [...] "fierce thief, vulgar murderer", since {{the second half of}} the 20th century writers (especially supporters of the Revisionism of Risorgimento) began to see him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light,</b> as an [...] "engine of the peasant revolution" [...] and a [...] "resistant ante litteram, one of the most brilliant military geniuses that Italy had".|$|E
2500|$|By {{then the}} Grants {{had been gone}} two years, and were homesick. [...] They crossed the Pacific and landed in San Francisco in September 1879, greeted by cheering crowds. [...] After a visit to Yellowstone National Park, they {{returned}} at last to Philadelphia on December 16, 1879. [...] The two-and-a-half-year voyage around the world had captured popular imagination, and Republicans—especially those of the new Stalwart faction, who had excluded from the Hayes administration—saw Grant <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b> [...] With Hayes having forsworn a second term when he was elected, the nomination for 1880 was wide open, and many thought that Grant was the man for the job.|$|E

Wright [...] "has given a detailed account of the bad press Amazons had in the Renaissance (with respect to their unwomanly conduct and Scythian cruelty).

2500|$|Grant's two-year and seven-month voyage {{around the}} world {{captured}} the popular imagination, and Republicans—especially those of the Stalwart faction—saw Grant <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> <b>light.</b> Grant's world tour {{had given him the}} much needed foreign policy experience he had lacked when he had first entered office in 1869, giving him added political clout. Grant's friend Adam Badeau was correct in his estimation, that as soon as Grant returned to the United States he would once again be absorbed by the world of politics. Among wide spread support, however, Grant was immediately branded by his political enemies as a puppet for the Stalwarts. The New York Sun in its headline retorted, [...] "Ulysses S.

Recollecting his friend in an interview, Bellow said [...] "Allan inhaled books and ideas the way the rest of us breathe air...People only want the factual truth. Well, the truth is that Allan was a very superior person, great-souled. When critics proclaim the death of the novel, I sometimes think they are really saying that there are no significant people to write about. [...] Allan was certainly one." ...|$|E

In this time his daughter Wanda is introduced, who hates Magneto for abandoning her {{as a child and}} leaving her in a mental asylum (when asked about what specific event led to Magneto institutionalizing Wanda, X-Men: Evolutions head writer Greg Johnson stated that [...] "There was no specific event.
