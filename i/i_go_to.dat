5|$|The first {{incarnation}} {{of my life}} was as a ruthless killer. I still live {{with a sense of}} sin over those I killed. I chased them and shot them down—such a horrible thing to do. Now, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the kindergarten every day and interact with the children. I want to nurture kind and considerate hearts in all of them. Harada also traveled to the United Kingdom and United States to meet some of the American and British airmen he had fought against, including the American ace Joe Foss who {{is believed to have been}} the pilot who shot down his plane. As part of his travels Harada visited Santa Isabel Island, where he located the wreckage of his fighter and brought a section of it back to Japan.|$|E

500|$|According to Paul Mullie, having Froot Loops as O'Neill's breakfast was not scripted, {{and he is}} unsure if {{the loop}} {{reference}} was intentional. [...] This was contradicted by Script coordinator Cath-Anne Ambrose who said [...] "I had to get Froot Loops cleared , and so the guy calls me back and says, 'Well {{how do you feel}} about Eggo Waffles? Would you consider using Eggo Waffles instead of Froot Loops?' So <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> these guys [...] and ask, 'How do you feel about waffles?' And they're like, 'No! It's Froot Loops! It's a time loop! No!' Waffle sales were down." ...|$|E

I get in the car and Baby’s my instructor. We’re in Atlanta taking a tour [...] Baby is like, ‘Bow, pull over. Tell this to shorty.’ He tests me on my speaking game with the ladies.

500|$|... "Soul Sound" [...] {{was written}} by the Scottish {{musician}} Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, [...] "In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state." [...] She elaborated, [...] "My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, {{which is why they}} can take so much out of me to perform – and I always feel a lot when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Africa".|$|E
500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing I think of every morning when I wake and the last thing I think of every night before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|E

60|$|Come {{to think}} of it, I did enter a saloon. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see Johnny Heinhold in the Last Chance, and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> borrow money. And right here is another phase of John Barleycorn. Saloon-keepers are {{notoriously}} good fellows. On an average they perform vastly greater generosities than do business men. When I simply had to have ten dollars, desperate, with no place <b>to</b> turn, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Johnny Heinhold. Several {{years had passed since}} I had been in his place or spent a cent across his bar. And when <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> borrow the ten dollars I didn't buy a drink, either. And Johnny Heinhold let me have the ten dollars without security or interest.|$|R
500|$|In 2002, Thompson starred {{alongside}} John Lynch, Geraldine Somerville, Lauren Cook and John Thomson in the Jim Doyle-directed film Re-Inventing Eddie. The {{movie is}} about a man named Eddie (Lynch), who is hounded by social services and branded a paedophile after an innocent bathtime game with his children is taken out of context. About two years later and shortly before entering teenagehood, Thompson successfully auditioned to feature in the BBC children's comedy programme Stupid!. Out of around 400 hopeful youngsters, {{he was one of}} only a few to be selected to appear in the show. Prior to Stupid!s launch on the CBBC channel in 2004, Thompson commented, [...] "When I first started going to auditions I was quite nervous but now I just get on with it. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> quite a few and it gets easier." ...|$|E
500|$|Otis Phillips Lord, {{an elderly}} {{judge on the}} Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from Salem, in 1872 or 1873 became an {{acquaintance}} of Dickinson's. After the death of Lord's wife in 1877, his friendship with Dickinson probably became a late-life romance, though as their letters were destroyed, this is surmised. Dickinson found a kindred soul in Lord, {{especially in terms of}} shared literary interests; the few letters which survived contain multiple quotations of Shakespeare's work, including the plays Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, Hamlet and King Lear. In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's Complete Concordance to Shakespeare (1877). Dickinson wrote that [...] "While others go to Church, <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn that no one knows but us?" [...] She referred to him as [...] "My lovely Salem" [...] and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that [...] "Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day".|$|E
500|$|... is in two stanzas, each {{comprising}} five lines. The first line, [...] literally: [...] "Wide meadows in twilight grey", {{was translated}} by Richard Stokes as [...] "Broad meadows in grey dusk". The first line rhymes with lines 3 and 4, in both stanzas on [...] "dark" [...] vowels, [...] and , with line 4 repeating line 1. Line 2 rhymes with line 5 {{on a light}} vowel, [...] and [...] The term , a combination of [...] (twilight) and [...] (grey), repeated four times (in lines 1 and 4) contrasts with the final word [...] (light). The third line of the poem describes the walk to meet the woman in first person, after detailing meadows, twilight, {{the sun and the}} stars: [...] (Now <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the most beautiful woman).

500|$|The {{painting}} {{depicts a}} scene from Summer in which the young Damon sits thinking by a stream on a hot summer's day. The beautiful Musidora strips naked to cool down by bathing in the stream, not knowing that Damon can see her. Damon is torn between his desire to watch her and the [...] "delicate refinement" [...] of knowing he should avert his gaze. Damon decides to respect her modesty and leaves {{a note on the}} riverbank reading [...] "Bathe on, my fair,/ Yet unbeheld save by the sacred eye/ Of faithful love: <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> guard thy haunt;/ To keep from thy recess each vagrant foot/ And each licentious eye". Musidora sees the paper and panics, but on reading it and realising that it has been written by Damon, feels admiration for his behaviour as well as a surge of pride that her own beauty can provoke such a reaction. She leaves him a note in turn, reading [...] "Dear youth! sole judge of what these verses mean,/ By fortune too much favoured, but by love,/ Alas! not favoured less, be still as now/ Discreet: the time may come you need not fly." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{earlier version}} of [...] "Full on Idle", Title TKs eighth track, was {{released}} on the Amps' Pacer in 1995. In a 1997 interview, Deal {{expressed an interest in}} redoing multiple Amps songs, partially because she did not feel Pacer was well recorded. Bryant opined that both versions of [...] "Full on Idle" [...] sound almost the same, but The Village Voices Jessica Grose wrote that the Breeders' rendition is noticeably slower. In Cibula's view, this version contains elements of country music, cumbia, and ska. The Guardians Betty Clarke cited the line [...] "Obey your colorist, bleach it all away" [...] as an example of Title TKs amusing, off-center lyrics. On [...] "Sinister Foxx", Deal repeatedly sings [...] "Has anyone seen the iguana?" [...] She has explained this as being a reference to buying marijuana: [...] "Have you ever bought a bag of weed? You walk in, and the pot dealer's got an empty terrarium ... Every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a pot dealer's house, there's no iguana." [...] Another line, [...] "I'm in beer class every Thursday night", refers to the alcohol awareness classes that Richard Presley attended after being caught driving while drunk. Phares described the song as having a [...] "sexy menace", and Berger compared the drum part to gunshots and door-knocking.|$|E
500|$|Mars' {{music has}} been noted for {{displaying}} {{a wide variety of}} styles, musical genres, and influences, including pop, rock, reggae, R, soul, and hip hop. His debut album Doo-Wops & Hooligans, a pop record, is influence by these genres. His subsequent release, Unorthodox Jukebox, as with his debut album, is infused with different influences including dance, rock reggae and soul, as well as balladry. Lyrically, the album is different than the former, addressing traditional notions of romance, male chauvinism, and sexuality. The explicit content in the song [...] "Gorilla" [...] caused a controversy in Australia. Many of his songs, particularly on Doo-Wops & Hooligans, reflect [...] "feel-good", carefree, and optimistic sentiments. However, darker subjects are addressed in his songs, detailing failed relationships and self-destructive behaviour. Mars' third album, 24K Magic, is significantly influence by R, soul music and funk. Lyrically, the album involve themes of money and sex. Mars has explained his writing process: [...] "I don't sit down and think, 'I'm going to write a song', inspiration hits me always unexpectedly: on a plane, when I'm out or just before <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed. An idea will suddenly come to my mind, and sometimes I manage to turn it into lyrics the next day. Sometimes it'll take me one year to get something real out of it. You can’t force creativeness." ...|$|E

500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because I think every doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{staff of}} The Line of Best Fit ranked [...] "Habits (Stay High)" [...] at number 6 {{on their list}} of the 50 Best Tracks of 2013 and wrote that it was [...] "easily {{one of the most}} vital pop songs of the year". Rolling Stone ranked the {{recording}} at number 23 on their list of the 50 Best songs of 2014 and compared the song's production to that of Lorde's music and the lyrics to those of Kesha's songs. Chris Jordan of Asbury Park Press deemed it {{as one of the best}} singles of that year and stated that [...] "it was refreshing to hear the debauchery depicted" [...] in the song. Echoing this thought, Chris DeVille of Stereogum ranked the track at number 26 on his list of Top 50 Pop Songs of 2014 and confessed that: [...] "For a song that derives much of its appeal from being out-of-control and over-the-top, 'Habits' is a work of extreme poise and precision from a pop songwriter with a blindingly bright future." [...] Entertainment Weekly 's Miles Raymer selected the line [...] "I eat my dinner in my bathtub / Then <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> sex clubs / Watching freaky people gettin' it on" [...] on his list of the best lyrics of 2014 and wrote that it was [...] "one of the most interesting images to come out of a pop singer's mouth this year".|$|E
500|$|Singapore was a {{critical}} race in the championship as all five drivers {{had a chance to}} take the lead with a victory. The situation was made difficult for Alonso as he had used his allocation of eight engines following the Italian Grand Prix, and to replace one would incur a ten-place grid penalty. His rivals each had at least one untouched engine in reserve; Webber had two. Nevertheless, Alonso set himself the target to score points in Singapore. He also acknowledged that his car was not the fastest in the field and felt he needed five podiums in the season's five remaining races. Webber stated that he was expecting Singapore to be a tough weekend for him after he had retired from the event in 2008 and 2009, but felt there was still some time before a driver clinched the championship. [...] After crashing out of the first lap of the Italian Grand Prix, Hamilton said he would push hard to stay in the running for the championship: [...] "I'll take each race as it comes, but I'll also be making sure I get to the finish of the next five races, that's more important than anything. <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Singapore to win." [...] Hamilton felt Alonso was the favourite to win the Singapore Grand Prix and viewed the Spanish driver as his main rival for the Drivers' Championship which was shared by Red Bull team principal Christian Horner. Button himself believed Alonso would have an extra advantage as the Spaniard's teammate Massa was out of contention for the title.|$|E
