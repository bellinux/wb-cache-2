40|$|This paper {{constructed}} a multiobjective programming model and designed Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm for earthquake emergency {{to solve the}} optimal decision-making question of Multihub <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> collection network with constrained demand period and collection time as fuzzy interval numbers and capacity limit to hub nodes. As for algorithm design, a two-stage parallel solution mode was employed to achieve the global optimal solution in the solution space. At first, the paper {{is based on the}} constraint to the total time of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> collection system and the capacity limited to Multihub; this paper allocated the <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> at each demand point to Multihub from which the <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> would be transferred. Secondly, this paper searched for the optimal plans from some feasible plans to determine the distribution directions and <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> collection amount at <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> provision points as well as the optimal collection cost that meet the constraint of demand time. Finally, the result of case verification showed that, compared with simulated annealing (SA) and sequential enumeration method (SEM), Multihub <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> collection model based on PSO parallel algorithm made a great improvement in the number of iterations and the optimal collection time, indicating that this model is feasible and effective and can be used in decision-making for earthquake <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> collection...|$|R

(1) Following the {{principle}} of “unified planning, classified guidance, centralized management and hierarchical implementation,” three levels of the emergency plan system, including an overall emergency response plan, specific contingency plans and on-site disposal plans, are established. (2) A full-time rescue team and a part-time rescue team are formed according to the metro’s network operation characteristics. (3) A hierarchical mechanism for <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> management is designed. All types of <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> equipment are positioned according to their related area of management responsibility and are divided into professional <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies,</b> flood control, and <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies,</b> and fire <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies.</b> (4) The external emergency links are strengthened. Currently, an emergency response mechanism has been established that includes cooperation among different departments, such as fire control, police, the community, public transport, electrical power, and the gas supply station.|$|R

The goal is to ensure a fast and effective response when the disaster strikes. Pre-positioning of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> is a strategic decision aimed at determining the number and location of local distribution centers as well as their inventory levels for <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies.</b> These decisions must be made in a highly disruption-prone environment where a timely response is vital and resources are scarce. We present and discuss a scenario-based model that integrates location, inventory and routing decisions...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The <b>Emergency</b> <b>Supplies</b> Dispatching Problem, as an {{extension}} of Vehicle Routing Problem, is an important subject in emergency relief. In this paper, we focus on a specific kind of <b>Emergency</b> <b>Supplies</b> Dispatching Problem which considers the accessibility of vehicles and different vehicle types. In consideration of the actual conditions, the vehicle types may be various, and some emergency locations cannot be reached by certain types of vehicles due to the destruction of roads. Therefore, the problem addressed in this paper is more practical. We build a mathematical model of the <b>Emergency</b> <b>Supplies</b> Dispatching Problem which includes multiple depots and emergency locations, multiple kinds of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> and multiple types of vehicles. Then we adopt genetic algorithm to solve an example based on the model. The effectiveness of the model has been proved by analyzing the computational results...|$|R

The stockpiling and production of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> should depend on private manufacturers in some cases, and the government will offer the manufacturer a subsidy to encourage its investment on extra reserves. This study investigates the manufacturer’s optimal decision on reserve investment and the government’s optimal subsidy policy based on mathematical models. The results indicate that to gain maximum benefit, the manufacturer should allocate its funds on both physical material reserve and production capacity reserve according to the government’s subsidy policy, while the government should {{take note of the}} relation between subsidy policy and subsidy period to ensure the manufacturer’s provision level of <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies.</b>|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} and inform <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> of prescription-only medicines by community pharmacists (CPs), including how the service could form an integral component of established healthcare provision to maximise adherence. DESIGN: Mixed methods. 4 phases: prospective audit of <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> requests for prescribed medicines (October-November 2012 and April 2013); interviews with CPs (February-April 2013); follow-up interviews with patients (April-May 2013); interactive feedback sessions with general practice teams (October-November 2013). SETTING: 22 community pharmacies and 6 general practices in Northwest England. PARTICIPANTS: 27 CPs with experience {{of dealing with}} requests for emergency supplies; 25 patients who received an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> of a prescribed medicine; 58 staff at 6 general practices. RESULTS: Clinical audit in 22 pharmacies over two 4 -week periods reported that 526 medicines were requested by 450 patients. Requests peaked over a bank holiday and around weekends. A significant number of supplies were made during practice opening hours. Most requests were for older patients and for medicines used in long-term conditions. Difficulty in renewing repeat medication (forgetting to order, or prescription delays) was the major reason for requests. The majority of medicines were 'loaned' in advance of a National Health Service (NHS) prescription. Interviews with CPs and patients indicated that continuous supply had {{a positive impact on}} medicines adherence, removing the need to access urgent care. General practice staff were surprised and concerned by the extent of <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> episodes. CONCLUSIONS: CPs regularly provide <b>emergency</b> <b>supplies</b> to patients who run out of their repeat medication, including during practice opening hours. This may aid adherence. There is currently no feedback loop, however, to general practice. Patient care and interprofessional communication may be better served by the introduction of a formally structured and funded NHS <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> service from community pharmacies, with ongoing optimisation of repeat prescribing...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a multiple-rescue model for an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> chain system under uncertainties in large-scale affected area of disasters. The proposed methodology takes into consideration that the rescue demands {{caused by a}} large-scale disaster are scattered in several locations; the servers are arranged in multiple echelons (resource depots, distribution centers, and rescue center sites) located in different places but are coordinated within one <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> chain system; depending on the types of rescue demands, one or more distinct servers dispatch emergency resources in different vehicle routes, and emergency rescue services queue in multiple rescue-demand locations. This emergency system is modeled as a minimal queuing response time model of location and allocation. A solution to this complex mathematical problem is developed based on genetic algorithm. Finally, {{a case study of}} an <b>emergency</b> <b>supply</b> chain system operating in Shanghai is discussed. The results demonstrate the robustness and applicability of the proposed model...|$|R
