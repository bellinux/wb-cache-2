40|$|The {{hippocampus}} {{is a major}} limbic {{target of}} the brainstem serotonergic neurons that modulate fear, anxiety, and learning through postsynaptic serotonin 1 A receptors (5 -HT 1 A receptors). Because chronic stress selectively down-regulates the 5 -HT 1 A receptors in the hippocampus, we hypothesized that mice lacking these receptors may exhibit abnormalities reminiscent of symptoms of stress-related psychiatric disorders. In particular, a hippocampal deficit in the 5 -HT 1 A receptor could contribute to the cognitive abnormalities often seen in these disorders. To test whether a deficit in 5 -HT 1 A receptors impairs hippocampus-related functions, we studied hippocampal-dependent learning and memory, synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus, and limbic neuronal excitability in 5 -HT 1 A-knockout (KO) mice. 5 -HT 1 A-KO animals showed a deficit in hippocampal-dependent learning and memory tests, such as the hidden platform (spatial) version of the Morris water maze and the delayed version of the Y maze. The performance of KO mice was not impaired in nonhippocampal memory tasks such as the visible platform (nonspatial) version of the Morris water maze, the <b>immediate</b> <b>version</b> of the Y maze, and the spontaneous-alternation test of working memory. Furthermore, paired-pulse facilitation in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus was impaired in 5 -HT 1 A-KO mice. Finally, 5 -HT 1 A-KO mice, as compared with wild-type animals, displayed higher limbic excitability manifested as lower seizure threshold and higher lethality in response to kainic acid administration. These results demonstrate that 5 -HT 1 A receptors are required for maintaining normal hippocampal functions and implicate a role for the 5 -HT 1 A receptor in hippocampal-related symptoms, such as cognitive disturbances, in stress-related disorders...|$|E

40|$|Background: Grief {{has been}} {{associated}} with several long-term negative outcomes for both surviving parents and bereaved children, especially when it is preceded by unnatural and violent deaths. Nevertheless, it has been an underestimated public health problem with few, if any, empirically documented early preventive intervention programs. The best time to start them is also a major question that requires further evidence. Objective: The overall aim {{of this study is to}} assess the feasibility of a future larger trial, informing sample size calculation, recruitment/randomization procedures, retention rates, data collection forms, and outcomes. This study will also explore: (1) the early effects of Systematic Early Intervention for Bereaved (SEIB) compared with the early effects of care as usual, and (2) the effects of the <b>immediate</b> SEIB <b>version</b> compared with the effects of the delayed SEIB version. Methods: In a pilot randomized controlled trial (RCT) with a delayed intervention design, suddenly bereaved families will be assigned to: the immediate-SEIB intervention group, or the delayed-SEIB intervention group. Participants will fill in a set of self-report measures at baseline, and after 3, 6, and 9 months follow-up. Quantitative data on traumatic stress symptoms, complicated grief, psychological wellbeing, daily functioning, social support, parental capacity, parenting practices, and family functioning will be collected to inform power calculations and explore SEIB’s preliminary effects. Data on the flow of participants throughout the trial will be analyzed in order to estimate recruitment and retention rates. Two brief questionnaires were developed to assess recruitment procedures, randomization, and data collection materials. Results: Recruitment for this project started in August 2015, and follow-up data collection will be completed in June 2017. Conclusions: This study prepares the ground work for the design and implementation of a main trial and may add preliminary knowledge to the significance of early supportive practices that have been commonly used regardless of their sparse evidence. </p...|$|R
40|$|We have {{developed}} VitisCyc, a grapevine-specific metabolic pathway database that allows researchers to i) search and browse the database for its various components such as metabolic pathways, reactions, compounds, genes and proteins, ii) compare grapevine metabolic networks with other publicly available plant metabolic networks, and iii) upload, visualize and analyze high-throughput data such as transcriptomes, proteomes, metabolomes etc. using OMICs-Viewer tool. VitisCyc {{is based on}} the genome sequence of the nearly homozygous genotype PN 40024 of Vitis vinifera ‘Pinot Noir’ cultivar with 12 X v 1 annotations and was built on BioCyc platform using Pathway Tools software and MetaCyc reference database. Furthermore, VitisCyc was enriched for plant-specific pathways and grape-specific metabolites, reactions and pathways.

40|$|The study investigates. {{the use of}} the Bender Gestalt Test (BGT) amongst low-educated adults. Three {{versions}} of the BGT are used in this study; the original 'copy' version as well as the 'immediate' and 'delayed'recall versions. This is done so as to expand the ability of the BGT to identify neurological impairment and to differentiate between this and functional impairment. A literature review explores the problems of standardization in the administration, scoring and application of all three {{versions of}} the test Suggestions are made to correct the problems identified and a novel system of scoring the recall versions are proposed, which allows for the comparison of results of the three versions of the test and which is based on Lacks's (1984) and Weiss's (1970) systems. Administration procedures were also developed to suit the context of the study. The copy, <b>immediate</b> and delayed <b>versions</b> of the BGT were administered to a group of 184 low-educated adults. Statistical analyses revealed significant education effects for the sample tested with regards to both test scores and performance time. The finding of an education effect for performance time is discussed at length, as some literature regards excessive time as a neurological indicator. An anomaly for the group with no education was found to exist, with the scores of these subjects not Significantly different from those with 4 - 6 years of education. Possible reasons for this were explored. In addition, the findings of this research revealed a plateau effect with those having less than 6 years of education scoring substantially lower than those with 7 years and more. The scores of adults with 7 and more years of education level out with no significant differences between educational levels. This appears to suggest that education effects rather than the developmental maturity level proposed by Koppitz, are involved. In addition, the scores of low-educated adults on the expanded Bender Gestalt Test were significantly lower than those of children with similar educational levels, in other studies. These findings and possible explanations are discussed. The study concludes by suggesting new research areas and emphasizing the urgent need for separate normative data on the expanded BGT for low-educated adults, and the establishment of appropriate 'cut-off' points. ...|$|R
