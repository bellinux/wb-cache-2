The only commercially active industry located at the docks is Bowering's Animal <b>Feed</b> <b>Mill.</b> The towpath forms part of Sustrans' National Cycle Network route NCR-3 connecting Bath and Cornwall, and attracts numerous travellers. Plans have been proposed for the upgrading of the towpath and development of a visitor centre at Maunsel.|$|E

5|$|Bormann's {{studies at}} an {{agricultural}} trade high school were interrupted {{when he joined}} the 55th Field Artillery Regiment as a gunner in June 1918, in the last days of World War I. He never saw action, but served garrison duty until February 1919. After working a short time in a cattle <b>feed</b> <b>mill,</b> Bormann became estate manager of a large farm in Mecklenburg. Shortly after starting work at the estate, Bormann joined an antisemitic landowners association. While hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic meant that money was worthless, foodstuffs stored on farms and estates became ever more valuable. Many estates, including Bormann's, had Freikorps units stationed on site to guard the crops from pillaging. Bormann joined the Freikorps organisation headed by Gerhard Roßbach in 1922, acting as section leader and treasurer.|$|E

When Hank, his older, {{socially}} challenged brother Jacob and Jacob's friend Lou chase a fox into the woods, they stumble upon a crashed airplane. Hank decides to look inside the plane where he discovers a dead pilot and a bag containing $4.4 million in $100 bills. He suggests turning the money in but is persuaded not to by Jacob and Lou. Hank then proposes that he keep the money safe at his house {{until the end of}} winter. Sheriff Carl Jenkins drives by the area and notices the three men after they hide the money in Jacob's pick-up truck. Jacob mentions hearing a plane in the area to avoid suspicion. After Carl leaves, the three men decide to keep the money a secret, but Hank breaks the pact when he reveals the discovery to Sarah.|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important industrial {{building in the}} area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long history}} of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a <b>feed</b> <b>mill.</b> He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E

25|$|The Weyauwega {{derailment}} was {{a railroad}} accident {{that occurred in}} Weyauwega, Wisconsin, USA, {{in the early morning}} hours of March 4, 1996. The derailed train was carrying a large quantity of hazardous material, which immediately caught fire. The fire, which involved the train cars and an adjacent <b>feed</b> <b>mill,</b> burned for more than two weeks after the actual derailment, resulting in the emergency evacuation of 2,300 people for 16 days, including the entire city of Weyauwega, with about 1,700 evacuees.|$|E
25|$|After the Civil War {{concluded}} in 1865, {{a variety of}} new businesses were established to better serve the Palmyra area. A large grain warehouse, a slaughterhouse and lumber mill were some of the first industries developed in Palmyra. The town’s first newspaper was printed in 1878 and was titled “The Londonderry Gazette”. The Palmyra Bank opened in 1887. The first of several shoe factories opened in 1888. A knitting mill, paper box factory, gas and fuel company, bakery, bottling works, and a <b>feed</b> <b>mill</b> was also open in Palmyra around the start of the 20th century. The growth of Milton S. Hershey’s chocolate company in nearby Derry also encouraged people to move to the Palmyra area.|$|E

2500|$|The Dundee mill, {{also known}} as the Alfred Wilkerson Grist Mill, is located at 242 Toledo Street in Dundee, Michigan. [...] A sawmill, {{constructed}} in 1828, originally stood on this site. [...] In 1846, Alfred Wilkerson built the nearby log dam, and in 1848-49 he replaced the earlier sawmill with the current structure, a gristmill. [...] In 1880, Wilkersons sold the mill to Henry Smith, who sold it in 1882 to Captain R.B. Davis. [...] Davis continued to use the site as a flour and <b>feed</b> <b>mill,</b> but in 1910 sold it to the Dundee Hydraulic Power Company. [...] The Dundee Power Company built a small hydroelectric plant at the site in 1912, [...] but in the 1920s, Detroit Edison began supplying power to the village, and the millsite was abandoned.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the local}} fire crew {{arrived on the}} scene five minutes after the derailment, fireballs were {{exploding}} up to 300 feet (90 m) high that were visible for nearly 13 miles (21 km). Fire spread to a nearby <b>feed</b> <b>mill</b> and storage building that were both difficult to access by the fire crew because the derailed train was blocking the grade crossing. High tension power lines were also torn down by the derailment, which caused secondary electrical fires. In total, seven of the tank cars of LPG and propane leaked, and the two sodium hydroxide tank cars leaked their contents. [...] Electricity and natural gas service to 25% of the city of Weyauwega was disrupted, and city water services had to be shut off because of a rupture in a water main.|$|E
40|$|An {{assessment}} of soybeans and other vegetable proteins as source of salmonella contamination in pig production Martin Wierup 1 *, Per Häggblom 2 Background: The impact of salmonella contaminated feed ingredients on {{the risk for}} spreading salmonella to pigs was assessed in response to two incidences when salmonella was spread by feed from two <b>feed</b> <b>mills</b> to 78 swine producing herds. Methods: The assessment was based on results from the salmonella surveillance of feed ingredients before introduction to <b>feed</b> <b>mills</b> and from HACCP- based surveillance of the <b>feed</b> <b>mills.</b> Results from the mills of the Company (A) that produced the salmonella contaminated feed, were by the Chi.

2500|$|The American windmill, or wind engine, {{was invented}} by Daniel Halladay in 1854 and was used mostly for lifting water from wells. Larger {{versions}} were also used for tasks such as sawing wood, chopping hay, and shelling and grinding grain. In early California and some other states, the windmill {{was part of a}} self-contained domestic water system which included a hand-dug well and a wooden water tower supporting a redwood tank enclosed by wooden siding known as a tankhouse. During the late 19th century steel blades and steel towers replaced wooden construction. [...] At their peak in 1930, an estimated 600,000 units were in use. Firms such as U.S. Wind Engine and Pump Company, Challenge Wind Mill and <b>Feed</b> <b>Mill</b> Company, Appleton Manufacturing Company, Star, Eclipse, Fairbanks-Morse, Dempster Mill Manufacturing Company and Aermotor became the main suppliers in North and South America. These windpumps are used extensively on farms and ranches in the United States, Canada, Southern Africa, and Australia. They feature a large number of blades, so they turn slowly with considerable torque in low winds and are self-regulating in high winds. [...] A tower-top gearbox and crankshaft convert the rotary motion into reciprocating strokes carried downward through a rod to the pump cylinder below. Such mills pumped water and powered feed mills, saw mills, and agricultural machinery.|$|E
