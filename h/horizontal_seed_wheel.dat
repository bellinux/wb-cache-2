40|$|In-furrow {{application}} of granular insecticides in corn {{is an effective}} way to provide root zone protection against insects such as corn root worm, wire worms, cutworms, white grubs and other harmful species. Traditional granular application methods consist of dispensing a uniform {{application of}} pesticide over {{the entire length of the}} furrow. A seed-specific granular pesticide application system was developed to decrease the volume of chemical used by metering pesticide into a modified seed tube fitted with a brush to hold granules in the seed tube. As a seed passes through the brush, granules are released and fall into the open furrow near the seed. Modifying seed tubes with a brush introduced the possibility of an effect on seed spacing. Effect of the seed tube modification on seed spacing was evaluated in laboratory and field trials. ^ Lab trials were performed using a stationary corn planter row unit. Variables tested were brushes (no, yes), granules (no, yes), seeds per second (8. 4, 20. 6), and tilt (no, 8 ° sidehill, 8 ° sidehill x 8 ° downhill). High speed video (1000 fps) recorded seed trajectory and the data was analyzed using multiple linear regression. Results showed while the brushes variable increased the standard deviation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>seed</b> velocity, vertical seed velocity, and seed speed, the combination of brushes and granules did not affect the standard deviation of <b>horizontal</b> <b>seed</b> velocity, vertical seed velocity, or seed speed. ^ Field trials consisted of 4 row plots, 30 m (100 ft) long, and replicated 3 times for a total of 12 rows for each variable. Data was recorded by measuring plant-toplant spacing. Data was then analyzed as a complete, unaltered, set and as an adjusted set with all data points 50 % above expected and 50 % below expected removed. Multiple linear regression was the analysis method of choice. Results showed that the brushes and granules combination did not affect seed spacing but did decrease standard deviation of seed spacing (full data set) and increase standard deviation of seed spacing (adjusted data set). ...|$|R

The model shows Roll up Expansion of the Twin Horizontal Ice crystal Thermal (RETHIT) due to buoyancy. Rise of horizontal ice crystal thermal while rotating, expanding and entraining the supercooled cloud volume leads to formation of ice crystals which possess sufficiently large size and necessary fall velocity in a large cloud volume within a likely cloud lifetime at the cloud top.

40|$|Abstract. Long-distance seed {{dispersal}} {{is an important}} topic in ecology, but notoriously difficult to quantify. Previous modeling approaches have failed to simulate long-distance dispersal, and it has remained unclear which mechanisms determine long-distance dispersal and what their relative importance is. We simulated wind dispersal of grassland plant seeds with four mechanistic models of increasing complexity and realism to assess which pro-cesses and which attributes of plants and their environment determine dispersal distances. We compared simulation results of the models {{to each other and}} to data from field dispersal experiments. The more complex and realistic models predicted short-distance dispersal more accurately and were the only models able to simulate long-distance dispersal. The model comparisons showed that autocorrelated turbulent fluctuations in vertical wind ve-locity are the key mechanism for long-distance dispersal. Seed dispersal distances are longest under high wind velocity conditions, when mechanically produced turbulent air movements are large. Under very low wind velocity conditions seeds are dispersed farther when there is more surface heating, but never as far as during strong wind events.

A citywide survey assessed wall and tree characteristics to understand wall-tree relationships and identify conservation candidates. Nonparametric correlations were computed between 28 wall attributes versus tree count, tree biomass, and species-vegetation factors. Most of the 245 walls, with 1275 trees, were in residential areas. Moraceae dominated the 30 tree species, predominantly genus Ficus, and especially F. microcarpa. Natives formed the overwhelming majority, largely with pioneer and ruderal traits. The positive effect of adjacent built-up {{land use and}} negative effect of wall exposure indicated sheltering from wind could facilitate tree growth. Wall height was a key determinant as taller walls furnished more surfaces free from human disturbance and conducive to seed deposition by frugivorous birds and bats. Stone width offered more <b>horizontal</b> microsites for <b>seeds</b> to lodge. Stone roughness operated at the microscale to encourage nonarboreal vegetation.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of sowing is the {{distribution}} of seeds at an optimal depth with adequate seed spacings. The results of the optimal sowing, in both horizontal and vertical directions, are better germination and sprouting, as well as increased yield and reduced influence of plants on each other’s space for growing, regarding the available light, nutrients and moisture. Quality of <b>horizontal</b> and vertical <b>seed</b> distribution {{is influenced by the}} distance between rows, sowing depth, pre-sowing preparation, seed drill, seeding mechanism, sowing density, and operator’s skills. The arithmetic mean of spacing (Am), standard deviation for spacings between the plants (SD) and coefficient of variation (CV) are usually used for representation of sowing evenness. Assuming that the seeds are of good germination quality, the yield is directly dependent on the sowing quality and organization of plants per unit of surface area.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to improve the utility of hollow fibre bioreactors (HFB) {{for the growth of}} {{clinically}} applicable cell populations by improving initial rates of cell attachment using a novel dynamic seeding methods, and to investigate their use as a novel cell encapsulation device for the delivery of cell therapies to infarcted heart tissue. Cardiac cell therapies starting are traditionally administered by direct injection or intravenous infusion to a target area in the heart. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have shown promise as a cell therapy and can be isolated from a patient’s adipose tissue surrounding the heart, allowing 812, 800 ± 318, 400 cells to be harvested; however this population requires expansion to a minimum of 50 million cells to be an effective traditionally administered dose in humans. Hollow fibre bioreactors have shown to offer the highest rates of MSC growth compared to other bioreactor designs, owing to their large surface area to volume ratio and their ability to provide the cells with a low shear environment that can emulate in vivo conditions. However, a concern with using HFBs is the relatively low rates of initial cell attachment, with authors observing rates around 20 %. At this rate of attachment and with an initial population of 812, 800 ± 318, 400 cells, it would take 12. 6 ± 5. 2 days to grow 50 million MSCs in a HFB. For use as a medical intervention the MSCs must be grown as soon as possible, and to ensure this the efficiency of cell seeding on the external hollow fibre surface must be as high as possible. In an attempt to improve rates of initial cell attachment Chapter 4 illustrated how dynamic seeding can allow additional opportunities for a given cell to make contact with hollow fibres contained in a bioreactor. MG 63 human osteosarcoma cells were used as an alternative cell type due to their lower cost and increased resilience over a greater number of passages. Static <b>horizontal</b> <b>seeding</b> of MG 63 cells on single fibre bioreactors provided 18 % ± 16 % cell attachment confirming values found in literature, however dynamic attachment on horizontally orientated multi fibre bioreactors rotating at 6 RPM offered improved attachment of 39 % ± 12 %, double the rate of static attachment. At this improved rate of cell attachment, it would now take 11. 2 ± 4. 7 days to grow 50 million cells, 1. 4 days quicker than before. This novel approach to HFB seeding will lead to quicker administration of medical treatments for patients. While traditional delivery methods have shown to improve heart function, the active dose retained at the wound site is around 2 %, much lower than that actually administered. Cells can be ejected from the insertion site due to heart contractions, and doses contained in the bloodstream become highly diluted. Engineered alternatives include cellular sheets, cell-loaded sutures, and cell encapsulation within hydrogels. However, each of these have their own inherent limitations, with cellular sheets demonstrating poor rates of migration into infarct site, cells on suture surfaces shearing away when sown into a wound site, and cells in hydrogels suffering from poor initial rates of engraftment. Hollow fibres made from poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) were further investigated for use as an engineered cell delivery vector, with cells seeded within the hollow fibre lumen, allowing cells to be protected during implantation, biodegrade, and provide a concentrated cell dose at a wound site. Hollow fibre scaffolds have been used as a delivery device for encapsulation of pharmaceuticals, but never for encapsulation of cells in this manner. Chapter 5 investigates the development of a hollow fibre with internal and external surface porosity, which allowed passive permeation of liquid through its structure {{from one side to the}} other. Manufacturing a hollow fibre using NaCl porogen at 60 % the weight of PLGA resulted in pores 4 – 6 μm in diameter, which provided the desired liquid permeation characteristics and a flux of 6. 6 m 3 m- 2 h- 1 bar- 1 (± 77 %). Chapter 6 sought to encapsulate a population of MG 63 cells within the lumen of the hollow fibre, fed by permeation of media flowing in the extracapillary space (ECS), and investigate the viability of cells over a 6 day time course. Studies revealed that the cells became non-viable after 24 hours as a result of poor rates of dissolved oxygen permeation. Subsequent modelling of the system showed that an increased ECS flow rate of a 1. 49 mL/min should provide sufficient dissolved oxygen to sustain a population of 100, 000 cells in this system. This work demonstrates a vital first step in exploring a potential evolution in cell delivery, with further investigation required to fully explore the viability of hollow fibre devices for cell encapsulation...|$|R

This project is aimed at developing a better understanding of thermal damage caused by grinding of precision gear materials and also a model to predict the onset of burn in AISI 9310 gear steel. This study is concerned with the thermal aspects of grinding, which is mainly directed towards controlling thermal grinding damage. On the basis of a relatively simple heat transfer analysis, a relation has been derived for the grinding zone temperature for grinding processes in terms of the power consumption and the grinding parameters. By inverting the heat transfer solution, the allowable power corresponding to a critical surface temperature can be specified in terms of the grinding parameters. This concept has been applied to predict the onset of thermal damage for surface grinding of AISI 9310 gear steel using two different grinding wheels and two different coolants. The grinding wheels used for this research are plain alumina wheel- 32 A 80 -JVBE and Seeded Gel alumina abrasive- 5 SG 80 -JVS. The coolants used are water based coolant (FUCH PT 95 with water in the ratio 1 : 20) and straight oil coolant (Castrol 41 - 129 A). Thermal damage results for AISI 9310 using straight oil based coolant and 32 A 80 -JVBE has already been established.

Vegetative {{character}} states (growth form, branching pattern, leaves) of the two genera are described and compared. Damnacanthus always exhibits heterophylly and some species have paired thorns. The latter are interpreted as paired lateral shoots in the proximal part of a sympodial branch unit, and it is speculated that the paired thorns may be modified inflorescence shoots. Detailed information is also given on inflorescence structure and floral morphological and anatomical details of Damnacanthus and Mitchella. Particular {{emphasis is placed on}} the ovaries, the structure of which is remarkably similar in the two genera. The uniovulate locules are characterized by having campylotropous ovules which are inserted {{near the top of the}} septum; extensive obturator tissue covers part of the horizontally arranged curved ovule in cap-like manner. The micropyle of the ovule, obscured by the obturator, points upwards and to some degree also inwards, while the embryo sac is found in a ± <b>horizontal</b> position. The <b>seeds,</b> however, contain minute embryos, of which the radicles are pointing ± downwards. This apparently contradicting micropyle and radicle position finds its explanation in the unusual ovule structure and orientation and in the subsequent strong growth of the endosperm, through which the embryo is pushed to the position where it is found in mature seeds. The detailed structure of the drupaceous fruits and of the seeds of both genera are compared. Chromosome numbers (x = n = 11, 2 n = 22) are presented for Mitchella and Damnacanthus, certain palynological information is added, and literature on reproductive biological aspects is reviewed and supplemented by original observations. While Mitchella had been associated with various different tribes, Damnacanthus was in the past nearly always placed in the Morindeae. The investigated characters overwhelmingly support the close alliance between Mitchella and Damnacanthus. However, according to our present state of knowledge, the Morindeae appear to be a heterogeneous tribe, and at least a group of genera allied to Prismatomeris is probably to be removed. Damnacanthus and Mitchella do show certain agreements with the ‘core’ of the Morindeae, but their definite tribal placement should be withheld until a recircumscription of the Morindeae becomes available...|$|R
40|$|Gypsum steppes and saline steppes are {{restrictive}} environments, {{on which}} factors controlling seedling recruitment and establishment in early stages are little known. Information on the factors controlling recruitment and {{establishment of the}} gypsophytes and halophytes will improve our limited knowledge on arid edaphic endemism and provide a basic tool for the management and conservation of protected ecosystems, such as gypsum outcrops and saline steppes. Abandonment of agricultural lands in {{large areas of the}} Iberian Mediterranean region during the last decades is recognized like the most important regional global change driver. Our knowledge on secondary old-field succession in Mediterranean environments and its relationship with soil seed bank is extremely scarce and null on restrictive soils, such as gypsum steppes. We sampled a complete set of old-fields on gypsum soils (1 to 60 years since abandonment) in order to test whether re-installation of gypsum vegetation after cropland abandonment requires: (i) soil physical restructuration and (ii) chemical re-adjustment to enable growth and survival of specialized gypsophilous vegetation, and more specifically how time from abandonment drives such environmental change. At the same time, we sampled soil seed bank in order to answer two main questions: 1) How long did specialist species (gypsophytes) take to reappear in seed banks after crop abandonment of restrictive habitats? and 2) which role did the seed bank play in the recovery process of these habitats? In chapter 1, our results showed that secondary old-field succession on semi-arid Mediterranean gypsum soils is controlled by a complex set of factors with tiny overlaps between them. Surprisingly, time since abandonment explains {{only a tiny fraction of}} variance (3 %) found in composition. However, soil chemical features independently from time since abandonment are important for explaining differences found in old-field composition. These findings suggest that secondary succession on specialized Mediterranean soils does not follow the widely described amelioration process in which soil features and composition are tightly fitted along time. On the other hand, in chapter 2, we found high seed bank richness (77 species) and middle range seed density values (11, 670 seed/m 2). Soon in the succession we detected the main constituents of the specialist vegetation typical of gypsum environments, in aboveground and seed bank species composition. We found high correlation between species composition in the soil seed bank and the aboveground vegetation all along the succession process. These results suggest that composition and the density of the soil seed banks were not determined by the time after disturbance. Differences found in soil seed banks of different sites were mainly due to aboveground composition and physical and chemical edaphic parameters. In these restrictive environments specialized plants establish soon in the succession and almost no species replacement happens. Gypsum soils in arid and semi-arid environments impose an important restriction of vascular plants, as it has been reported by several authors. However, factors controlling the recruitment of gypsophytes and gypsovag species are not completely understood. On the other hand, few studies have focused on the impact of seed consumption by ants on the conservation status of endangered plant populations. In chapter 3, we researched the soil seed bank dynamics of Thymus funkii subsp. funkii, a gypsovag shrub endemic to the south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, to determine possible reasons for low recruitment in isolated populations growing on crusted gypsum soils. Recruitment-restriction hypotheses involving main factors in the seed bank dynamics were analysed, and a diagrammatic dynamics model drafted from a population perspective. Viable seed production averaged 362 per plant. Seed shadows resulting from primary dispersal were concentrated under the mother plant. There were two thyme seed predators: coleopteran larvae (pre-dispersal phase) and Messor bouvieri ants (pre- and post-dispersal phases), which predated 16. 4 % and 3. 8 % of population yield, respectively. However, ants may simultaneously contribute to the spatial secondary dispersal, since they lost a small fraction of seeds they harvested. Seeds showed innate physiological dormancy to high summer temperatures, although this disappeared rapidly. The response of germination to other temperature × light conditions was wide and rapid. No permanent seed bank was detected in the soil. Seeds buried in the upper soil layer (2 cm) germinated highly and fast. In contrast, a significant fraction of seeds buried deeply (8 cm) remained viable for over one year. Germination in the field accounted for only 1. 0 % of the seed output, and seed death due to pathogen attack and aging was also low (3. 0 %). Seedling emergence was confined to autumn and showed a high correlation with total plant cover, irrespective of plant species. Seedling survival was very low. The small spatial correspondence between primary dispersal and seedling emergence patterns may reflect the importance of secondary dispersal in T. funkii seed bank dynamics. Hypotheses and consequences of such <b>horizontal</b> <b>seed</b> movements for conservation management are discussed. In chapter 4, we examined the spatial and temporal patterns in the recruitment of Teucrium libanitis Schreb. (Labiatae), a gypsophyte endemic to the semi-arid south-eastern Iberian Peninsula, from the perspective of soil seed-bank dynamics. Seed production, seed dormancy, soil seed bank, aerial seed bank, seed predation and seedling emergence and survival were monitored for one biological cycle. Several microhabitats were considered to determine safe sites for the Teucrium libanitis recruitment. The gypsophyte T. libanitis forms a transient aerial seed bank and a persistent soil seed bank in gypsum steppe with a strategy well-adapted to a semi-arid environment. The existence of this persistent soil seed bank supports the theory that the recruitment is produced by the occurrence of favourable climatic events. Seeds were redistributed horizontally, accumulating under plant cover, but seedling survival was not dependent on these different microhabitats. Recruitment was not limited by predation or by seed death by aging and pathogen attack. At least, in chapter 5, we analyzed the fate of seeds removed by ants, seed supply, seedling survival, and the ability to form persistent seed bank in the soil by the critically endangered population of the non-myrmechorous perennial halophyte Helianthemum polygonoides in order to determine to what extent seed removal by ants represents a real bottleneck for recruitment and thus a threat for long-term population viability. In the absence of ants (Messor bouvieri and Aphaenogaster dulcineae), plants produced on average 969 viable seeds. Apparently the impact of seed-harvester ants was dramatic: 75. 5 % of reproductive plants were affected by pre-dispersal predation and the primary seed shadow was reduced up to 93 %. However, M. bouvieri lost 7 % of fruits (5. 5 % of seeds removed) by dropping on trunk trails, mostly under plant cover, the most propitious microenvironment for recruitment. In addition, a small fraction of seeds were mistakenly rejected in refuse piles, although here recruitment was extremely low. A significant fraction of seeds (¿ 40 %) persisted viable in the soil for over two years. In addition H. polygonoides had ability to form short-term persistent seed banks, in spite of the intense ant seed removal. In general, seedling recruitment was very low, denoting the scarcity of safe sites in the habitat. Those data overall corroborates that seed removal by ants, although highly intense, does not compromise the viability of perennial-plant populations, because seed supply and seed reserve in the soil are enough for exploiting current and future safe sites. A population viability analysis demonstrated that other threats affecting the survival of reproductive H. polygonoides plants would constitute the real risk for the conservation of that critically endangered species...|$|R
