25|$|Tiffany {{starred in}} the 2008 short film The Isolationist, which made the film festival rounds. Her character, Barbara Newman, is a sexually {{aggressive}} woman unwilling to let a co-worker enjoy some alone time. In 2009, she completed work on her first feature film, Necrosis, which was released internationally as Blood Snow. Necrosis was a psychological thriller in which she starred alongside James Kyson Lee and George Stults. In the film, she acted out the role of Karen, a fun-loving adrenaline junkie who took matters into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> after a blizzard had trapped her friends and her in a cabin, and paranoia {{got the best of}} them. Necrosis premiered at the 2009 Cannes Film Festival. Tiffany's former music rival, Debbie Gibson, had her film Mega Shark Versus Giant Octopus premiere at Cannes, as well. Tiffany also starred in a film from The Asylum, the mockbuster Mega Piranha, directed by Eric Forsberg, which also starred Barry Williams. Mega Piranha was the highest-rated SyFy movie of 2011.|$|E

25|$|Upon {{completion}} of the studies Sister {{was assigned to the}} laboratory of analytical chemistry headed by Professor Yuri Lyalikov. The laboratory {{was a part of the}} Institute of Chemistry at the Moldavian branch of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR, which became the Academy of Sciences of Moldova in 1961. Working in this laboratory allowed the young chemist Sister to begin her research with new polarographic methods. In order to carry out analysis of organic compounds by the means of alternating-current (ac) polarography Yulia built with <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> a polarograph and received the first polarograms. Sister was the first in Moldova (with Y. S. Lyalikov), who applied the methods of ac polarography and second harmonic ac polarography for analyzing organic compounds. Then, together with the physicist Vil Senkevich, they assembled an automatic device, and only later began the serial production of polarographs in the USSR. In the early 1960s Yulia published her first research articles. In 1967 she received her Ph.D. from the Institute of Chemistry of the Moldavian Academy of Sciences.|$|E
25|$|Baldwin V's rule, with Raymond of Tripoli as regent and his great-uncle Joscelin of Edessa as his guardian, was short. He was {{a sickly}} child {{and died in}} the summer of 1186. Raymond and his {{supporters}} went to Nablus, presumably in an attempt to prevent Sibylla from claiming the throne, but Sibylla and her supporters went to Jerusalem, where it was decided that the kingdom should pass to her, on the condition that her marriage to Guy be annulled. She agreed but only if she could choose her own husband and king, and after being crowned, she immediately crowned Guy with <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> Raymond had refused to attend the coronation, and in Nablus he suggested that Isabella and Humphrey should be crowned instead, but Humphrey refused to agree to this plan which would have certainly started a civil war. Humphrey went to Jerusalem and swore allegiance to Guy and Sibylla, as did most of Raymond's other supporters. Raymond himself refused to do so and left for Tripoli; Baldwin of Ibelin also refused, gave up his fiefs, and left for Antioch.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1861, Carroll {{traveled}} to St. Louis to work with secret agent, Judge Lemuel Dale Evans, who had been appointed by Secretary of State William H. Seward to assess the feasibility of a Union invasion of Texas. Carroll worked on her second war powers paper at the Mercantile Library. She also gathered information from the head librarian, who was the brother of Confederate General Joe Johnston. She took military matters into <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands</b> when she initiated {{an interview with a}} riverboat pilot, Capt. Charles M. Scott, about the feasibility of the planned Union Mississippi River expedition. Scott told her that he and other pilots thought the advance ill-conceived because there were many defensible points on the Mississippi River that could be reinforced. It could take years just to open up the river to navigation by trying to broach those points. Carroll questioned Scott about the feasibility of using the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers for a Union invasion of the South. Scott provided Carroll with technical navigation details. Based on this information, Carroll wrote a memorandum to Assistant Secretary of War Thomas A. Scott and Attorney General Edward Bates in late November 1861, advocating that the combined army-navy forces change their invasion route from the Mississippi to the Tennessee and Cumberland rivers.|$|E

25|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in a radio}} address, the Emperor of Japan announces {{the end of the}} War. Suzu, having faced countless {{setbacks}} and tragedies during the war, and had grown accustomed to the single-minded focus of keeping the family alive, is forced to accept the reality of her losses and temporarily falls into despair. Soon, the times begin to change rapidly: US occupation forces, no longer the enemy, come to Kure and provide food for its citizens. Suzu visits her grandmother Ito's family house in Kusatsu, a rural town to the west of Hiroshima and out of the affected area, to see her sister Sumi, who took refuge from deserted Hiroshima and is the only survivor of Suzu's family. Sumi informs Suzu of the fate of their parents; Sumi herself has fallen seriously ill from the radiation left behind by the atomic‐bomb radiation. Shūsaku, who returns from his naval service, meets with Suzu by chance in a deserted area of Hiroshima and tells her that he has found a new job. They come across a little girl, a war (atomic bomb) orphan struggling to survive in the ruins after losing her mother, and adopt her into their home in Kure. Suzu regains her passion for life slowly, with the courage and affection of her friends and family. As the credits roll, their adopted daughter is shown growing up in Suzu & Shūsaku's family home, sewing clothes with <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands,</b> aided by Suzu in peaceful post-war Japan.|$|E

Vossler catches up, after being left behind, at the Ogir-Yensa Sandsea, while {{on their way to}} the Tomb. He offers to protect Princess Ashe once again, despite objecting to Balthier and Fran's invading the royal tomb. However, once the party gets the treasure, the Dawn Shard, from the tomb, they are taken aboard the Leviathan once again. Here, Vossler reveals that he, embittered by their [...] "profitless battle", has made a deal with the Archadian Empire so that Dalmasca's sovereignty could be restored. After he was defeated he tells Basch that it's up to him to protect the Princess now. As Ashe and the others escape in an airship, the nethicite explosion from the Leviathan annihilates the fleet, Vossler is presumably alive because the Shiva was seen able to escape the explosion, albeit badly damaged. Vossler was voiced by Nolan North in English and by Masaki Terasoma in Japanese.|$|E

500|$|Her next {{appearance}} was in StarCraft II: Heart of the Swarm, {{where she is}} the central character, and it {{tells the story of}} her further fate, and of the Zerg Swarm as well. Once again a human, Kerrigan is brought by Raynor to a secret research facility run by Valerian Mengsk to determine how much of her skill at controlling Zerg remains from her time as the Queen of Blades. However, the facility is attacked by Dominion forces and while Kerrigan and Valerian manage to escape, Raynor becomes trapped. After returning to look for him, Kerrigan hears Mengsk's announcement that he was captured and executed. To enact revenge against Mengsk, Kerrigan, while traveling through the sector to reunite the Zerg Swarm under her control, is approached by Zeratul. Zeratul tells her to travel to Zerus, the original homeworld of the Zerg, where the primal Zerg are in a constantly evolving state. Kerrigan, initially reluctant, is convinced after Zeratul tells her there she can obtain enough power to move on with her vengeance plans. On Zerus, Kerrigan learns that Amon stole {{a large portion of the}} Zerg from Zerus and bound them to a single overriding will, making them Amon's slaves as part of his plot to destroy both the Zerg and Protoss and remake life in his own image. Kerrigan enters a chrysalis in the first Zerg spawning pool and emerges, transforming again into the primal Queen of Blades. She also realizes that Amon's lingering taint was partially responsible for the crimes she committed during the Brood War. Mengsk contacts Kerrigan and reveals that Raynor was not killed, but is held as a hostage instead, threatening to kill him should she wage war against the Dominion. With help from Valerian and Raynor's Raiders, Kerrigan manages to rescue Raynor, but is rejected by him for renouncing the human self that he worked so hard to restore. Now in full control of the Zerg Swarm once again, Kerrigan launches an attack on the Dominon's main world, Korhal, to defeat Mengsk. She is assisted by Valerian, who convinces her to give an opening for the civilians to escape, and is later assisted by Raynor's forces as well. Confronting Mengsk face to face, Kerrigan is almost defeated when he uses the Xel'naga artifact to attack her, but Raynor stops him, allowing her to kill Mengsk with <b>her</b> <b>own</b> <b>hands.</b> Kerrigan and Raynor make their peace and it is shown that they will always look out for each other, hinting an everlasting affection between the two. With the Dominion's leader destroyed, Kerrigan bids Raynor and Valerian farewell and starts to prepare herself and her swarm for [...] "the greatest battle they'll ever face".|$|E
