5|$|Easy is {{the most}} recent major {{hurricane}} to strike the Homosassa, Florida, area. Due to the hurricane remaining near the northwest Florida coast <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> of time, Easy produced severe rainfall and strong waves, resulting in heavy damage in the Cedar Key area. Hurricane Easy {{was one of two}} major hurricanes to strike Florida during the year; the other was Hurricane King which affected Miami.|$|E

Gardeners report lackluster tomatoes, farmers anticipate disappointing yields. We've watched gray skies, hoping for rain that rarely falls.

Evidence suggests that parts of the United States are positioned <b>for</b> <b>a</b> "megadrought," <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> of time with minimal rainfall...|$|R

He also worked as a construction worker, a doorman (bouncer), a security guard and a ditch digger, and briefly joined the United States Merchant Marine in 1945.

He resumed his songwriting career shortly before his December 1980 murder, which Ono witnessed at close range. She has stated that the couple was thinking about going out to dinner after spending several hours in a recording studio, but were returning to their apartment instead, because Lennon wanted to see Sean before he was put to bed.

Hurricane Four bypassed Bermuda to the east, where some property damage was reported. Hurricane Five was the most catastrophic storm of the season, buffeting western Cuba <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> of time as it slowly executed a counterclockwise loop. Death tolls from the hurricane are estimated in the hundreds.|$|E
5|$|The team {{itself was}} {{significantly}} different from the Invincibles squad. Bradman had retired; Sid Barnes, Don Tallon, Ernie Toshack and Bill Brown were unavailable, while the omission of Keith Miller caused a furore.

However, Johnston recovered, and both he and Miller took their places in all five Tests, eliminating any disadvantage caused by the controversial initial omission of the latter.|$|E

Flooding affected about 29% of the country's arable land, much of covered <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>extended</b> <b>period</b> of time.

About 50,000bovine were killed, as were 60% of the fowl population. Crop and agricultural damage totaled about $1billion, which would take the country years to recover. Poor road conditions following the storm prevented crops from being dried, which caused further damage.|$|E
5|$|After {{the special}} session of Congress had adjourned, Sherman {{returned}} home to Mansfield.
