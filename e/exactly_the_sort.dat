25|$|Early {{reports of}} torpedo action {{included}} some dud hits, heard as a dull clang. In a few instances, Mark14s would strike a Japanese ship and lodge in its hull without exploding. The contact pistol {{appeared to be}} malfunctioning, though the conclusion was anything but clear until running depth and magnetic exploder problems were solved. The experience of Dan Daspit (in Tinosa) was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of live-fire trial BuOrd had been prevented from doing in peacetime. It was now clear to all at Pearl Harbor the contact pistol was also defective. Ironically, a direct hit on the target at a 90 degree angle, as recommended in training, would usually fail to detonate; the contact pistol functioned reliably only when the torpedo impacted the target at an oblique angle.|$|E

Despite the implication in their name that their function is to merely gather intelligence, they are also intended to have a deterrent effect. This approach {{has been reported to}} work in reducing reports of anti-social behaviour at times when FITs are deployed in specific neighbourhoods. Jacqui Smith, then Home Secretary praised Operation Leopard that used FITs to target youths, in Laindon, Essex stating:"Operation Leopard is <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of intensive policing that can bring persistent offenders to their senses...

500|$|Since the composer's death writers {{sympathetic}} to his music have expressed regret {{that he is}} known by the musical public for {{only a handful of}} his scores such as The Carnival of the Animals, the Second Piano Concerto, the Organ Symphony, Samson et Dalila, Danse macabre and the Introduction and Rondo Capriccioso. Among his large output, Nicholas singles out the Requiem, the Christmas Oratorio, the ballet Javotte, the Piano Quartet, the Septet for trumpet, piano and strings, and the First Violin Sonata as neglected masterpieces. In 2004, the cellist Steven Isserlis said, [...] "Saint-Saens is <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of composer who needs a festival to himself... there are Masses, all of which are interesting.

Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an approval rating of 90 percent based on 10 reviews, {{with an average}} rating of 7.1 out of 10. A review in The Guardian praised Taran Mansukhani's direction and writing, calling it a [...] "a straight victory for gay comedy": [...] "India's convoluted attitude to gayness finally has its cinematic manifestation in Dostana, one of the gayest films ever made in any country but in which almost no one is actually gay. It's also a terrific movie – the best and funniest Bollywood film I've seen {{in a very long}} time." [...] Describing the film as a [...] "decent-hearted comedy", Rachel Saltz of The New York Times wrote: [...] "Dostana deserves credit. It irreverently normalizes a topic that has been virtually absent from screens in India, and does so using contemporary Bollywood’s best not-so-secret weapon: star power."

500|$|... "Miss Independent" [...] {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews from music critics, who lauded Clarkson for distancing herself from her American Idol persona, but criticized the song's resemblance {{to some of}} the songs on Stripped— particularly [...] "Dirrty" [...] and [...] "Fighter" [...] (2002). On its release, Brian Hiatt of Entertainment Weekly noted that [...] "its hard R sound may shock fans who embraced the mellow [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] "Miss Independent" [...] begins with Clarkson singing in a throaty moan over a bangin' hip-hop beat, then bursts into a power-chord-propelled, disco-diva chorus that's not unlike Britney Spears' [...] "Stronger"." [...] Rolling Stone wrote, [...] ""A Moment Like This" [...] was <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>sort</b> of treacly by-the-numbers ballad critics expected of a TV-contest winner; that's probably why its assertive follow-up, [...] "Miss Independent," [...] was such a surprise." [...] AllMusic's senior editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that it [...] "managed to make Kelly Clarkson seem younger and hipper without slutting her up like Christina Aguilera (who, ironically, co-wrote [...] "Miss Independent," [...] the first single from Thankful) while retaining a strong sense of melodic songcraft." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine wrote that the song [...] "gives Clarkson the youthful edge she desperately needs to balance out the Adult Contemporary goo of songs like [...] "Anytime" [...] and [...] "A Moment Like This." [...] Cinquemani also added, [...] ""Miss Independent" [...] is no [...] "Dirrty," [...] but it proves that if anyone can out-sing Aguilera, it's Clarkson."

In Thomas v. Carnival Corp., it held that an arbitration clause requiring a Philippine national to arbitrate a negligence claim there under Panamanian law, which had no equivalent of the Seamen's Wage Act on which the claim was based, worked in tandem to deny Thomas an opportunity for review by an American court, and was therefore null and void.

40|$|This note gives a {{necessary}} condition, {{in terms of}} graded actions, for an inverse semigroup to be a full amalgam. Under a mild additional hypothesis, the condition becomes sucient. This note introduces graded actions of inverse semigroups, a notion already implicit {{in the work of}} Lawson on ordered representations [3] and the author on semidirect products of inverse semigroups [7]. If one studies inverse semigroups from the inductive groupoid point-of-view (see for instance [4]) then these are <b>exactly</b> <b>the</b> <b>sorts</b> of actions which arise from inductive groupoid actions as per the author's [7]. Subsequent work of the author and Lawson [5] will show that graded partial actions of inverse semigroups lead to a natural proof of the structure theorem for idempotent pure extensions of inverse semigroups [4]. In this paper, we use graded actions to provide a generalization of the -pong" theorem for amalgamated products of groups [6, Proposition 12. 4] to full amalgams of inverse semigroups [...] ...|$|R
