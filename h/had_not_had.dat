5|$|On August 16, 2009, at {{the closing}} {{performance}} of the show Yulong, a set of bleachers with a carrying capacity of 450 people and holding 420 at the time collapsed, sending seven people to the hospital. In the ensuing investigation, it came to light that Juventas <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the bleachers inspected each time they were set up, as required by their lease with the city. They had been issued a permit in 2006 for the bleachers, and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> them inspected since. The school was fined $500 and shut down until the legal and safety issues could be fully investigated. It reopened about a month later and installed new bleachers with molded plastic seats the next March.|$|E

5|$|After 1971, {{particularly}} {{after the release}} of Fireball, Gillan started to become disillusioned with the workload of the band, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> any holiday since their initial rehearsals at Hanwell. He started drinking, and relationships between him {{and the rest of the}} band became strained, particularly with Blackmore. On 6 November 1971, he collapsed with hepatitis while waiting to board a plane in Chicago, cancelling the remainder of a US tour.|$|E
5|$|After {{nine days}} {{quartered}} at the capitol, {{the men of}} the 11th New York were moved to the heights near the Insane Asylum to Camp Lincoln. This move would allow for easy transport across the Potomac and into Virginia when necessary. While just five miles (8km) from the capitol, the standard of living the men were used to had changed dramatically, as their usual foodstuffs were replaced with beef steak, dry bread, and coffee. Ellsworth wrote to his fiance that they <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> butter in a week.|$|E
5|$|As a yearling, Oxbow {{was sent}} to the Keeneland sales, where he was {{purchased}} for $250,000 by bloodstock agent Eddie Kane, acting on behalf of Brad M. Kelley's Bluegrass Hall. In 2012, the Calumet Investment Group bought Calumet Farm and leased it to Kelley, who moved his Bluegrass Hall racing operation and 200 horses from his Hurricane Hill farm to the historic Calumet property in early 2013. Prior to 2013, Calumet Farm <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a winning horse in a Triple Crown race since 1968.|$|E

5|$|Egyptian field commanders {{complained of}} a total lack of {{topographical}} maps causing a real problem in {{the first months of}} the war. Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates. Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation. Chief of Egyptian Intelligence, Salah Nasr, admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent. Egypt <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> an embassy in Yemen since 1961; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen, all he provided was an economic report on the country.|$|E
5|$|In 2005 Cohen started {{classes for}} adults {{who wished to}} {{celebrate}} their Bar and Bat Mitzvah, but <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity when 12 or 13. That same year, {{in the aftermath of}} Hurricane Katrina, Beth Israel welcomed between 75 and 100 evacuees from New Orleans. In 2006 Beth Israel had a membership of approximately 200 families which, in contrast with Mississippi's other Jewish congregations, was slowly growing. Beth Israel's services were attended by about 50 people in 2008. , it remained the first, and only, synagogue in Jackson, and was the largest Jewish congregation in the state. Cohen was the rabbi.|$|E
5|$|Laforey's {{success was}} {{considered}} impressive by historian William James, as his ship carried only 28 nine-pounder cannon {{in contrast with}} L'Huillier's 32 twelve-pounder guns and four 24-pounder carronades. Castor was also a larger ship with a slightly larger crew, and although L'Huillier and his men had only been aboard for ten days, the crew of Carysfort had only come together immediately before the cruise and <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> much longer to become acquainted with their vessel than the French crew.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. The Army <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited in range, they were reasonably effective.|$|E
5|$|The Murano was {{announced}} in 2005 when Philadelphia, Pennsylvania was experiencing a condominium boom that had begun in the late 1990s; between 1998 and 2004 more than 70 Center City office and manufacturing buildings had been converted into rental and condominium apartments. The project was jointly developed by Thomas Properties Group of Los Angeles and P Associates of Philadelphia. The planned site of the Murano was on West Market Street in Center City, an area which <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> any residential development until 2002 when 2121 Market Street was converted into apartments. Construction began {{around the end of}} 2005.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> any mechanical {{or technical}} errors or problems prior to take-off. The turbulence and wind shear caused {{a crack in}} either the tail rudder, the tailplane, or both. This was caused by strong winds acting {{on both sides of}} the structure, due to shifting winds. These structural failures caused the aircraft to crash. Out of the 63 seconds from take-off to impact, the aircraft was under control for the first 55 seconds; only during the last 8 seconds did the crew not have control over the aircraft.|$|E
50|$|In {{theories}} {{of competition in}} economics, a barrier to entry, or an economic barrier to entry, is a cost that must be incurred by a new entrant into a market that incumbents do <b>not</b> <b>have</b> or <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> to incur.|$|R

5|$|The {{company was}} self-supporting, {{with its own}} engineer, signals, transport, and {{quartermaster}} sections. The signals section had a powerful but cumbersome Wireless Set No. 11 for communicating with the 7th Division. Powered by lead-acid batteries which were recharged with petrol generators, it required multiple signallers to carry and the noise was liable {{to attract the attention}} of the enemy. The platoons were equipped with the new Army No. 208 Wireless Sets. These were small, portable sets developed for the communication needs of units on the move in jungle warfare. However, the 2/6th Independent Company <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> time to work with them operationally.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the war {{he spent}} most of his time flying {{throughout}} Europe and meeting various commanding officers and units. He took advantage of his position to fly other types he <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the chance to operate. He flew Supermarine Spitfires frequently on such trips. Soon after the Normandy Campaign he took leave to visit his mother in Ireland. She was staying with his sister Mary, (and his niece) who had lost her husband killed in action at Anzio in Italy. He remained with 11 Group until the capitulation of Germany on 8 May 1945.|$|E
5|$|After her {{sentencing}} Green {{continued to}} maintain that her recall of {{the night of the}} fire was limited. In the summer of 1996, she wrote to her daughter claiming that she had taken more than the recommended doses of her medications that night. Similar letters to Michael Farrar varied from claims that she had no recollection of the night to firmly stating that she was innocent of the arson. She theorized that Margaret Hacker had set fire to the family's house, and reiterated her claim from the show-cause hearing that Tim had been the one to poison his father. Green wrote to author Ann Rule in 1996 asserting that, due to alcohol abuse, she <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> the mental capacity to start a fire. In a later interview with Rule, she blamed her cloudy thinking during the court hearings on her Prozac prescription, and stated that once she was off the drug, her mind became much clearer.|$|E

5|$|Due to the team's struggles, Huggins made {{personnel}} {{changes during}} the offseason. The Yankees attempted to trade Pipp to another American League team, {{but could not}} agree on the terms with any team. They put Pipp on waivers, and he was acquired by the Cincinnati Reds of the National League, who reportedly paid the Yankees a greater sum than the $7,500 waiver price. The Reds, who <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a strong starting first baseman since Jake Daubert died in 1924, had attempted to acquire Bill Terry from the Giants, but refused to part with Edd Roush in the transaction, and so acquired Pipp instead. Pipp again attempted to acquire {{a portion of the}} purchase price, but was rebuffed.|$|E
5|$|Johnson {{believed}} that Congressional business was too slow and tedious, {{and that the}} per diem system of compensation encouraged delays {{on the part of}} members. To remedy this, he sponsored the Compensation Act of 1816. The measure proposed paying annual salaries of $1,500 to congressmen rather than a $6 per diem for the days the body was in session. (At the time, this had the effect of increasing the total compensation from about $900 to $1500. Johnson noted that congressmen <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a pay increase in 27 years, and that $1500 was less than the salaries of the 28 clerks employed by the government.) Johnson's bill provided that if a congressman was absent, his salary would be reduced proportionally.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{commanded}} by 62-year-old Captain Edward John Smith, {{the most senior}} of the White Star Line's captains. He had four decades of seafaring experience and had served as captain of , from which he was transferred to command Titanic. The {{vast majority of the}} crew who served under him were not trained sailors, but were either engineers, firemen, or stokers, responsible for looking after the engines; or stewards and galley staff, responsible for the passengers. The 6watch officers and 39able-bodied seamen constituted only around 5percent of the crew, and most of these had been taken on at Southampton so <b>had</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> time to familiarise themselves with the ship.|$|E
