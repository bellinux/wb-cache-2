50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> lesser eagle-owl, or Mindanao eagle-owl (Otus gurneyi) is {{a species}} of owl in the family Strigidae. It is endemic to the Philippines. In size and structure, it is {{considered}} intermediate between a scops owl and an eagle-owl. Its natural habitat is subtropical or tropical moist lowland forests. It is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The Pasonanca Natural Park {{provides}} a habitat to many threatened and restricted-range {{species of the}} Mindanao and Eastern Visayas Endemic Bird Area including the Zamboanga bulbul, Mindanao bleeding-heart, Philippine kingfisher, Philippine leafbird and little slaty flycatcher. It also supports the Philippine eagle, Mindanao broadbill, azure-breasted pitta, celestial monarch, southern silvery kingfisher, blue-capped kingfisher, spotted imperial pigeon, <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> Japanese night heron, Chinese egret, rufous-lored kingfisher, Philippine dwarf kingfisher and Philippine cockatoo.|$|E
5000|$|The Eurasian eagle-owl is {{a member}} of the genus Bubo, which may include either 22 or 25 extant species. Almost all the larger owl species in the world today are {{included}} in Bubo. Based on an extensive fossil record and a central distribution of extant species on that continent, the Bubo appears to have evolved into existence in Africa, although early radiations seem to branch from southern Asia as well. Two genera belonging to the <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> complex, the <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> (Otus gurneyi) found in Asia and the Ptilopsis or the white-faced <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> found in Africa, although firmly ensconced in the <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> group, appear to share some characteristics with the eagle-owls. The Strix is also related to the Bubo and is considered a [...] "sister complex", with the Pulsatrix possibly being intermediate between the two. The Eurasian eagle-owl appears to represent an expansion of the Bubo genus into the Eurasian continent. A few of the other species of Bubo seem to have been derived from the Eurasian eagle-owl, making it a [...] "paraspecies", or they at least share a relatively recent common ancestor. The pharaoh eagle-owl, distributed in the Arabian Peninsula and sections of the Sahara Desert through North Africa where rocky outcrops are found, was until recently considered a subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl. It appears that the pharaoh eagle-owl differs about 3.8% in mitochondrial DNA from the Eurasian eagle-owl, well past the minimum genetic difference to differentiate species of 1.5%. Smaller and paler than Eurasian eagle-owls, the pharaoh can also be considered a distinct species largely due to its higher pitched and more descending call and the observation that Eurasian eagle-owls formerly found in Morocco (B. b. hispanus) apparently did not breed with the co-existing pharaoh eagle-owls. On the contrary, the race still found together with the pharaoh in the wild (B. b. interpositus) in the central Middle East has been found to interbreed in the wild with the pharaoh eagle-owls, although genetical materials have indicated interpositus may itself be a distinct species from the Eurasian eagle-owl as it differs from nominate subspecies eagle-owls by 2.8% in mitochondrial DNA. The Indian eagle-owl was also considered a subspecies of Eurasian eagle-owl until recently, but its smaller size, distinct voice (more clipped and high-pitched than Eurasians), and the fact that it is largely allopatric in distribution (filling out the Indian subcontinent) with Eurasian eagle-owl races has led to it being considered a distinct species. The mitochondrial DNA of the Indian species also appears considerably distinct from the Eurasian species. The cape eagle-owl (B. capensis) appears to represent a return of this genetic line back into the African continent, where it leads a lifestyle similar to northern eagle-owls albeit far to the south. Another offshoot of the northern Bubo group is the snowy owl. It appears to have separated from other Bubo at least 4 million years ago.|$|R
50|$|The Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{has been}} {{considered}} to be conspecific with the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis, the Anjouan <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus capnodes rainforest <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus madagacarensis under O. rutilus but this species has now been split and the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is now regarded as its own species, mainly based on its very different call. The <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> of Madagascar, Comoros and Seychelles form a clade within the genus Otus with the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia and are not {{closely related to the}} continental African <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b>|$|R
50|$|The African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{regarded as the}} African subspecies of the <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> It was grouped with the Arabian <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and the Annobon <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> into Otus senegalensis; however these species are now considered to be separate.|$|R
50|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is known}} {{only from the}} islands of Dinagat, Siargao and Mindanao in the Philippines. Although {{it has not yet}} been proven, it has been theorized that Giant Scops Owls also exist on Marinduque, {{situated}} off the island of Luzon. Its habitat is primary and secondary forests, mostly at an altitude of under 670 m although it has been seen up to 1300 m. It sometimes frequents partially logged forests of Dipterocarpaceae species.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a {{medium-sized}} bird with {{a length of}} about 30 cm. It has a reddish-brown facial disc with a narrow black edge, white streaks above the eyes and prominent ear tufts. The {{back of the head}} and the upperparts of the body are reddish-brown boldly marked with black streaks and with a line of white streaks on the scapulars. The underparts are whitish with traces of reddish brown and bold black markings. The voice is a series of five to ten calls, [...] "wuaah, wuaah..." [...] with the series repeated at ten to twenty second intervals.|$|E
50|$|Aliwagwag {{occupies}} {{an important}} bird and biodiversity {{area in the}} Upper Cateel River Basin of the Agtuuganon-Pasian mountains. Its forest {{is home to the}} Philippine eagle as well as several other threatened and endemic bird species such as the Visayan miniature babbler, little slaty flycatcher and Lina's sunbird. The park also hosts the Philippine hawk-eagle, Philippine dwarf kingfisher, spotted imperial pigeon, <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and Hombron's kingfisher. It is also home to the tallest trees in the Philippines, the Philippine rosewood, known locally as toog. In the waters of the upper Cateel River, a rare species of fish can be found called sawugnun by locals which is harvested as a delicacy.|$|E
50|$|The {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus mayottensis, the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis and the torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus madagascarensis {{have all}} previously been lumped as one species. The taxonomy is {{in state of}} flux but recent genetic studies have placed the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> closer to the clade containing the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sengalensis, while the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is clearly separate from the remaining two. The status of the rainforest and torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa.|$|R
50|$|The Karthala <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> {{also known}} as Grand Comoro <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Comoro <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> (Otus pauliani) is a small, <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> endemic to the island of Grande Comore in the Comoro Islands.|$|R
50|$|The Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> the Mayotte <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus mayottensis, the Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus pembaensis and the {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus have all previously been lumped as one species.

The status of {{the rainforest}} and Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> as separate species is debatable as there may be very little genetic distance between the two taxa and subsequent {{studies have suggested that}} the plumage differences between rutilus and madgascarensis are small and that their voices intergrade. If that is the case then the rainforest and Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> become subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>giant</b> <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is rated}} as [...] "Vulnerable" [...] by the IUCN in its Red List of Threatened Species. This {{is because the}} {{population}} is declining as its forest habitat is destroyed by deforestation and by the mining of chromite. This bird was never a common species and {{it is thought that}} in 1999 there were between 3,500 and 15,000 individuals remaining. Of the three islands on which it is found, Dinagat has been almost completely denuded of forest, while on Samar and Mindanao almost all the remaining forest is leased to mining or logging companies. The charity [...] "Endangered Species International" [...] is using this owl and other endangered species on a trail in the Mount Matutum protected area to teach local people and visitors to the Philippines about the importance of preserving the habitat.|$|E
50|$|The pallid <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus brucei) {{is a small}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{ranging from}} the Middle East to West and Central Asia, {{sometimes}} called the striated <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Philippine <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus megalotis) is {{a common}} owl, endemic to the Philippines, {{belonging}} {{to the family of}} the typical <b>owls</b> Strigidae. Everett's <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and Negros <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> were formerly considered conspecific.|$|R
50|$|The Karthala <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{considered to be}} a subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus, but with the other Comoro Islands <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> it is now regarded as a separate species.|$|R
50|$|The sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is thought}} to be basal in the lineage of the genus Otus, along with the Sokoke <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus ireneae, but there has been no genetic {{material}} for testing from the sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> In addition some authorities consider that the subspecies of sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> should be teated as two different species.|$|R
50|$|The Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus insularis), {{also known}} as bare-legged <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or syer (in Creole) is a rare <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> species, which only occurs in the Morne Seychellois National Park on the Seychelles island of Mahé.|$|R
50|$|The {{rainforest}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus rutilus), {{also known}} as the Malagasy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is a species of owl in the family Strigidae. It is found in a large part of eastern Madagascar, but the exact distribution limits between it and the Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (O. madagascariensis), with which it was long considered conspecific, require further study.|$|R
50|$|The Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{previously}} lumped with the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis but differences in plumage and vocalisations {{have led to}} it being split. Recent genetic research suggests that its closest relatives are the Oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> and the Seychelles <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus insularis. An interesting theory this research has led to is that the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a taxon which evolved from a colonisation of a continent from island ancestors, an event which had previously been thought unlikely because island taxa {{were thought to be}} less competitive than related continental taxa.|$|R
50|$|The oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus sunia) is {{a species}} of <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> found in eastern and {{southern}} Asia.|$|R
50|$|The Pemba <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> was {{formerly}} {{regarded as a}} subspecies of the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus rutilus sensu lato due to morphological similarities but genetic {{research has shown that}} it is closer to the clade in which the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus senegalensis is situated.|$|R
50|$|The sandy <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus icterorhynchus), or {{cinnamon}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> is an owl {{form the}} familay Strigidae found in Africa.|$|R

50|$|The Torotoroka <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus madagascariensis) is a taxon of owl in {{the family}} Strigidae. It is endemic to Madagascar, and was {{previously}} regarded as its own species. However, O. madagascariensis and the rainforest <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus. rutilus have now been re-lumped following Fuchs et al. (2007) as the Madagascar <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> or Malagasy <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> The scientific name of the combined species {{is yet to be}} agreed, although rutilus would appear to be have priority.|$|R
5000|$|The Sula <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> (Otus manadensis sulaensis), {{is a small}} owl in the scops-owl genus Otus {{found on}} the Sula Islands. Taxonomically, some groups {{consider}} {{it to be a}} distinct species (Otus sulensis), others a subspecies of the Sulawesi <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> and yet others a subspecies of the Moluccan <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{collared}} <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is a small}} (23-25 cm) owl, {{although it}} is the largest of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b> Like other <b>scops</b> <b>owls,</b> it has small head tufts, or ears. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the subspecies, with faint buff spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking.|$|R

40|$|The {{avifauna}} of Indonesia {{is one of}} {{the richest}} in the World but the taxonomic status of many species remains poorly documented. The sole species of <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> known from Lombok has long been assigned to the widespread Moluccan <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> Otus magicus on the basis of superficial similarities in morphology. Field work in 2003 has shown that the territorial song of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> inhabiting the foothills of Gunung Rinjani differs dramatically from that of O. magicus and is more similar to those of Rufescent <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> O. rufescens and Singapore <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> O. cnephaeus. Detailed comparisons of sound recordings and museum specimens with those of other <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> in Wallacea and the Indo-Malayan region have confirmed the distinctiveness of the Lombok population. We describe Otus jolandae as a new species, the Rinjani <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl.</b> It is locally common at elevations from 25 - 1350 m and occurs within Gunung Rinjani National Park. The new species is known from seven specimens collected by Alfred Everett in 1896. Otus jolandae represents the first endemic bird species from Lombok...|$|R
50|$|The Indian <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is a small}} (23-25 cm) owl, {{although}} {{it is one of}} the largest of the <b>scops</b> <b>owls.</b> Like other <b>scops</b> <b>owls,</b> it has small head tufts, or ears. The upperparts are grey or brown, depending on the morph, with faint buff spotting. The underparts are buff with fine darker streaking.|$|R
50|$|The {{song of the}} Socotra <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> is a repeated, low pitched {{series of}} notes {{which is similar to}} that {{described}} for the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia.|$|R
30|$|The {{natural enemies}} of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> include {{various kinds of}} snakes. Because of {{cultural}} taboos, the Tao people do not hunt for, encroach on, or interfere with Elegant Scops owls; therefore, the indigenous people on Orchid Island are {{not a threat to}} the survival of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls.</b> However, the number of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> is low, and they are listed as endangered. After an in-depth analysis of the reason for this, it was determined that the low number of Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> is highly associated with tourism activities. The impacts of tourism activities on Elegant <b>Scops</b> <b>owls</b> are derived from four aspects, including habitat destruction, roadkill, light exposure, and the loss of taboo, each of which is described in the following sections.|$|R
50|$|The pallid <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> {{is a small}} eared owl {{similar in}} {{appearance}} to the Eurasian <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> but with more distinct streaks {{on the back and}} less intricate markings.|$|R
50|$|Little data {{is known}} about the Annobón <b>scops</b> <b>owl.</b> It is {{considered}} to have similar characteristics to the African <b>scops</b> <b>owl,</b> apart from a smaller wing length (about 120-135 mm).|$|R
50|$|This {{species is}} very similar to the {{slightly}} larger partially migratory collared <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus lettia and the oriental <b>scops</b> <b>owl</b> Otus sunia. They can be separated on call and eye colour.|$|R
40|$|Breeding {{timing is}} one of the key life-history traits {{considered}} to be under strong stabilizing selection, such that offspring should be born when food resources are most abundant. Predation, however, may also affect the breeding timing because nest predation is a leading mortality for many species, although this possibility has been less considered. Here, we examined the possible effects of nest predation on breeding timing by comparing sympatric <b>scops</b> <b>owls</b> in a subtropical forest where only reptilian predators are present. The Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus semitorques Temminck and Schlegel, 1844), a dietary generalist, bred one month earlier than the specialist Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (Otus elegans (Cassin, 1852)). The breeding timing of the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> matched with the emergence of their main prey species, but also matched with predator activity. Accordingly, the predation rate on eggs or nestlings was 7. 5 times higher in the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (13. 9 %; 21 out of 150 nests) than in the Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> (1. 9 %; 1 out of 52 nests). Clutch size, on the other hand, was significantly larger in the Ryukyu <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl</b> than in the Japanese <b>Scops</b> <b>Owl,</b> possibly compensating loss from predation. Although alternative explanations still remain, our results suggest that the food generalist might have adjusted its breeding timing to avoid nest predation, whereas the breeding timing of the specialist might have been constrained by the availability of its main prey items...|$|R
