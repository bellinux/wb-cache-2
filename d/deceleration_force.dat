5000|$|One of {{the common}} ways of {{describing}} the felt recoil of a particular gun-cartridge combination is as [...] "soft" [...] or [...] "sharp" [...] recoiling; soft recoil is recoil spread {{over a longer period}} of time, that is at a lower deceleration, and sharp recoil is spread over a shorter period of time, that is with a higher deceleration. Like pushing softer or harder on the brakes of a car, the driver feels less or more <b>deceleration</b> <b>force</b> being applied, over a longer or shorter distance to bring the car to a stop. However, for the human body to mechanically adjust recoil time, and hence length, to lessen felt recoil force is perhaps an impossible task. Other than employing less safe and less accurate practices, such as shooting from the hip, shoulder padding is a safe and effective mechanism that allows sharp recoiling to be lengthened into soft recoiling, as lower decelerating force is transmitted into the body over a slightly greater distance and time, and spread out over a slightly larger surface.|$|E

50|$|The carbon brakes in {{combination}} with tyre technology and the car's aerodynamics produce truly remarkable braking forces. The <b>deceleration</b> <b>force</b> under braking is usually 4 g (39 m/s2), and can {{be as high as}} 5-6 g when braking from extreme speeds, for instance at the Gilles Villeneuve circuit or at Indianapolis. In 2007, Martin Brundle, a former Grand Prix driver, tested the Williams Toyota FW29 Formula 1 car, and stated that under heavy braking he felt like his lungs were hitting the inside of his ribcage, forcing him to exhale involuntarily. Here the aerodynamic drag actually helps, and can contribute as much as 1.0 g of braking force, which is the equivalent of the brakes on most road sports cars. In other words, if the throttle is let go, the F1 car will slow down under drag {{at the same rate as}} most sports cars do with braking, at least at speeds above 250 km/h. The drivers do not utilise engine (compression) braking, although it may seem this way. The only reason they change down gears prior to entering the corner is to be in the correct gear for maximum acceleration on the exit of the corner.|$|E

40|$|The two {{first order}} reentry heating {{parameters}} are peak heating flux (W/cm 2) and peak heat load (kJ/cm 2).

Manned vehicle reentries are generally lifting reentries at nominal 1 - 5 gs so that personnel {{will not be}} crushed by high <b>deceleration</b> <b>force.</b> A few off-nominal manned reentries have experienced 8 or more gs with corresponding high heating flux (but below nominal heat load).

40|$|The {{concept of}} facial impact {{protection}} mask for cyclists is proposed {{in response to}} increased participation in cycling {{and the need for}} injury prevention. The research aims to develop an approach for design of facial impact protection gear {{to reduce the risk of}} severe injury. Impact test equipment and procedure, face surrogate and protection material performance criteria are developed. Three groups of protective materials – rigid crushable, semi rigid, and soft cushion foams are tested and assessed according to criteria. The criteria are linked to measures of the risk of facial and brain injuries: HIC (Head Injury Criterion), peak deceleration, Face-bone damage and energy absorption. The impact energy is simulated by a drop test using a 48 mm-radius-steel hemispherical impactor, with a weight of 4. 63 kg similar to that of headform J specified in AS/NZS standard. The drop-height is 1500 mm, and the linear <b>deceleration</b> <b>force</b> of the impactor is recorded and used to establish the performance of the materials. The HIC is used to predict the risk of brain injury, whereas the developed face surrogate is used to assess facial bone injury. A 5. 4 m/s facial impact to the unprotected-face of a cyclist can result in the risk of severe facial bone fracture and mild brain injury. The impact test results for rigid foam protection of 40 mm thickness shows no densification (bottom out) and absorbs the impact energy without damage to the Foam-bone of the face surrogate. At 20 mm thickness, rigid polyurethane foams performed best with Foam-bone damage ranging from 15. 1 % to 20. 5 %. Other materials with thicknesses of 20 to 28 mm showed Foam-bone damage between 21. 8 % and 35. 1 %. The HIC values ranged from 267 to 522, with memory foams and expanded polystyrene foam having the lowest values. Peak deceleration ranged from 71 g to 105 g for the materials tested. It is concluded that the impact energy can be dissipated by the protection material thereby reducing the risk of severe facial injury to the protected area...|$|E
40|$|It is {{stated that}} the {{aerodynamic}} forces on the vehicle being aerocaptured are controlled by "altering the angle of attack" and thereby controlling the lift coefficient. Furthermore, the resulting variation of drag coefficient with angle of attack was ignored. The purpose of this Comment is {{to point out that}} an aerodynamic control method that is much more effective than the pitch modulation has been studied and utilized during entries for many years. During aerocapture, it is desirable to have a large range of lift coefficients available, while keeping the vehicle's ballistic coefficients constant. This is accomplished by modulating the vehicle's bank angle, i. e., by rolling the vehicle about its velocity vector. By this method, the angle of attack can be held constant (at the trim angle, if desired), and the C(sub D) and the ballistic coefficient remain constant. Furthermore, the vertical component of the normal force vector (essentially the lift) can be varied over its entire range, from maximum positive to maximum negative values. Reaction controls, rather than aerodynamic ones, are usually utilized to change the bank angle of the vehicle, thus requiring the use of fuel. However, the fuel expenditure that is required to change the bank angle is far less than the amount {{that would have to be}} used to continuously hold the vehicle at pitch angles that differ significantly from its trim angle of attack. Also, it has been shown that bank angle modulation to vary the lift can enlarge the entry corridor by increasing the entry angle for the undershoot boundary, where both the heating rate and deceleration reach a maximum. Finally, the crew's deceleration tolerance can be increased somewhat when the bank angle is varied, as opposed to the pitch angle. For bank modulation, the <b>deceleration</b> <b>force</b> vector can be kept at a constant angle with respect to the occupants whose tolerance to g loads is highest when the force is applied in a direction normal to the upper torso. The advantages of bank angle variation to modulate the lift vector were recognized long ago, and this method of control was used successfully on the Apollo command module during lunar return' and, more recently, for the Space Shuttle Orbiter...|$|E

40|$|For {{the past}} four decades, Mars {{missions}} have relied on Viking heritage technology for supersonic descent. Extending the use of propulsion, which is required for Mars subsonic deceleration, into the supersonic regime allows the ability to land larger payload masses. Wind tunnel and computational experiments on subscale supersonic retropropulsion models have shown a complex aerodynamic flow field characterized by the interaction of underexpanded jet plumes exhausting from nozzles on the vehicle with the supersonic freestream. Understanding the impact of vehicle and nozzle configuration on this interaction is critical for analyzing {{the performance of a}} supersonic retropropulsion system, as deceleration will have components provided by both the aerodynamic drag of the vehicle and thrust from the nozzles. This investigation focuses on the validity of steady state computational approaches to analyze supersonic retropropulsion flowfield structures and their effect on vehicle aerodynamics. Wind tunnel data for a single nozzle and a multiple nozzle configuration are used to validate a steady state, turbulent computational fluid dynamics approach to modeling supersonic retropropulsion. An analytic approximation to determine plume and bow shock structure in the flow field is also developed, enabling rapid assessment of flowfield structure for use in improved grid generation and as a configuration screening tool. Results for both the computational fluid dynamics and analytic approaches show good agreement with the experimental datasets. Potential limitations of the two methods are identified based on the comparisons with available data. Six additional geometries are defined to investigate the extensibility of the analytical model and determine the variation of supersonic retropropulsion performance with configuration. These validation geometries are split into two categories: three geometries with nozzles located on the vehicle forebody at varying nozzle cant angles, and three geometries with nozzles located on the vehicle aftbody at varying nozzle cant angles and number of nozzles. The forebody nozzle configurations show that nozzle cant angle is a significant driver in performance of a vehicle employing supersonic retropropulsion. Aerodynamic drag preservation for a given thrust level increases with increasing cant angle. However, increasing the cant angle reduces the contribution of thrust to deceleration. The tradeoff between these two contributions to the <b>deceleration</b> <b>force</b> is examined, noting that performance improvements are possible with modest nozzle cant angles. Static pitch stability characteristics are investigated for the lowest and highest cant angle configurations. The aftbody nozzle configuration results show that removing the plume flow from the region forward of the vehicle results in less interaction with the bow shock structure. This impacts aerodynamic performance, as the surface pressure remains relatively undisturbed for all thrust values examined. Static pitch stability characteristics for each of the aftbody nozzle configurations are investigated; noting that supersonic retropropulsion for these configurations exhibits a transition point from static stability to instability as a function of this center of mass location along the axis.
