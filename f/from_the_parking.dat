5|$|Black and the FBI {{investigate}} the crime scene; Black not only realises the bomber's proficiency with explosives, but {{is able to}} work out that he viewed the bombing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> garage. In a bin in the garage, they find a tissue covered in Dees' semen. Black informs the FBI that the bomber is smart {{enough to be able}} to tap into their phonecalls, and volunteers to bait him into eavesdropping on his mobile phone. Black's deduction is correct, and as he attempts to stall Dees on the phone while the FBI trace the call, he realises from Dees' language that the bomber is seeking to become famous through his actions. Dees informs the FBI that he has planned another bombing for the next morning.|$|E
5|$|Located at {{the highest}} point of the Municipality lies El Volcan, a small {{mountain}} of about 1500 meters from sea level. This mountain has a Downhill course that has about 500 meters of vertical drop, it is used by hundreds of riders a day during dry and wet weather, mostly on weekends. The course {{is open to the}} public and riding is neither specifically allowed nor prohibited by law. The trails are also used by hikers all week long. Shuttles are about 10 Venezuelan bolivars per trip, they run <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot of a Farmatodo drug store in La Boyera, up to the summit using public avenues and paved roads, taking from 15 minutes to 30 minutes depending on traffic on the area. The course apart from being used mostly for recreational purpose, also has been used for irregularly scheduled downhill races due to the lack of organisation in the riders community.|$|E
5|$|The first {{aircraft}} at Fornebu was a Lufthansa Junkers Ju 52 in September 1938. It {{had flown}} a scheduled route to Kjeller, {{and the captain}} had continued to Fornebu to try the new airport. On 16 April 1939, the seaplane section came into regular use. The first seaplane was a Ju 52 operated by DNL to Copenhagen. The official opening was on 1 June 1939. The first aircraft to land after the official opening was a Douglas DC-2 operated by KLM from Amsterdam. The first departure was on the Danish airline Det Danske Luftfartsselskab, when a Focke-Wulf Fw 200 took off to Copenhagen. The captain made a mistake, and took off <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> space instead of the runway. In addition to these two routes, Luft Hansa started flights to Germany and DNL flew to Amsterdam. During the fall, DNL also flew from Perth, Scotland, via Oslo to Stockholm, but this route was soon canceled.|$|E

25|$|At {{the turn}} of the millennium, the Ottawa Airport Authority {{announced}} plans to build a second, adjacent terminal {{to meet the demands of}} increased traffic.

A section of the 1960 terminal, which was connected to the new terminal by an enclosed bridge, was still used at peak times of the day when extra gate space is needed, and it also handled most domestic prop flights. Funding for the new terminal was collected <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> meters outside the terminal beginning in January 1997, when rates were hiked to cover the costs of a new terminal building.|$|E

25|$|Shahzad is {{believed}} to have bought the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder on April 24, a week prior to the attempted bombing. The vehicle had been listed in an online Craigslist ad, and he reportedly bought it from a female Connecticut college student for $1,300 (negotiated down from $1,800), which he paid in $100 bills. He reportedly exchanged the cash for the car at a Connecticut shopping center parking lot, where he inspected the interior and cargo area (but not the engine) and declined the offer of a bill of sale. He later had the car windows tinted, which made it harder to peer inside. A surveillance tape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot shows Shahzad test-driving the car, according to the FBI. He bought a second vehicle through Craigslist (a black Isuzu Rodeo) from a mechanic in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{consists of}} a single large nave mostly constructed of metal. Inside, {{there are a number}} of narrow aisles containing stalls owned or rented by individual merchants. Most merchants are grouped by the type of merchandise they sell, such as party supplies, dishes, and pets. What little parking lot is left is filled by street vendors. On Saturday, when the market is busiest, these vendors overflow <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot onto the surrounding narrow streets. These and various trucks and other vehicles block traffic, effectively closing the streets. The scene is noisy, filled with shouts of vendors and music blaring from stands selling CDs. However, this is also the time to find the widest variety of merchandise, such as nopal cactus and fresh corn from Milpa Alta, flower pots and soil from Xochimilco, and medicinal herbs from Puebla, Morelos and the State of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The only ways to {{the island}} are {{swimming}} or boating. Canoeists and kayakers {{have the option of}} launching from a small parking lot maintained by the Pennsylvania State Park Service adjacent to the north point of the island or from Bull's Island recreational area roughly one mile (1.6km) upstream on the New Jersey shore of the river. A public boat launch several miles downstream in Lambertville, New Jersey makes a convenient place to take out a boat. Any unpowered boats launched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>parking</b> lot on the Pennsylvania side require a launch permit from the Pennsylvania Fish & Boat Commission. Larger boats should not attempt to approach the island's rocky shore line. Boaters passing by the area of the island are best off going through the far eastern channel of the river between Eagle Island and New Jersey; the other two channels are frequently too shallow for safe passage.|$|E
