50|$|The {{connecting}} rod is under tremendous stress from the reciprocating load {{represented by the}} piston, actually stretching and being compressed with every rotation, and the load increases as {{the square of the}} <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increase.</b> Failure of a {{connecting rod}}, usually called throwing a rod, {{is one of the most}} common causes of catastrophic engine failure in cars, frequently putting the broken rod through the side of the crankcase and thereby rendering the engine irreparable; it can result from fatigue near a physical defect in the rod, lubrication failure in a bearing due to faulty maintenance, or from failure of the rod bolts from a defect, improper tightening or over-revving of the engine. In an unmaintained, dirty environment, a water or chemical emulsifies with the oil that lubricates the bearing and causes the bearing to fail. Re-use of rod bolts is a common practice as long as the bolts meet manufacturer specifications. Despite their frequent occurrence on televised competitive automobile events, such failures are quite rare on production cars during normal daily driving. This is because production auto parts have a much larger factor of safety, and often more systematic quality control.|$|E

A four stroke {{gasoline}} engine Magma 4 G 15 is used as a reference in this study. The engine simulation has been done using one dimensional GT-Power software and the simulation are at the various engine speed. The engine speed is varied for five different cases staring from 1000, 2500, 3000, 4500 and 6000 rpm at wide open throttle. The simulations are conducted with the purpose to test the applicability of exhaust gas calorimeter model in order to quantify the heat losses through exhaust gas. The model considered the calorimeter system components such as water reservoir, pipe for water in and out as a cold fluid and pipe connected from exhaust tail pipe to the calorimeter for the hot fluid. It is important to evaluate energy losses in the engine in order to increase the engine performance. The result showed that {{the rate of}} heat losses through the exhaust gas is increased with the increasing of engine speed.

This paper presents the experimental results on the lean operational limits of Recardo E 6 engine using gasoline, LPG, NG and hydrogen as fuels. The first appearance of almost motoring cycle was used to define the engine lean limit after the fuel flow was reduced gradually. The effects of compression ratio, engine speed and spark timing on the engine operational limits are presented and discussed in detailed. Increasing compression ratio (CR) extend the lean limits, this appears obviously with hydrogen, which has {{a wide range of}} equivalence ratios, while for hydrocarbon fuel octane number affect gasoline, so it can' t work above CR= 9 : 1, and for LPG it reaches CR= 12 : 1, NG reaches CR= 15 : 1 at lean limit operation. Movement from low speeds to medium speeds extended lean misfire limits, while moving from medium to high speeds contracted the lean misfiring limits. NOx, CO and UBHC concentrations increased with CR increase for all fuels, while CO 2 concentrations reduced with this increment. NOx concentration increased for medium speeds and reduced for high speeds, but the resulted concentrations were inconcedrable for these lean limits.

40|$|It {{has been}} {{observed}} though not documented that some gas filling stations in Nigeria adulterate their fuel before selling to customers. Numerous engine users had also complained of fuel obtained from some petrol filling stations burn faster than others. Engines used in automobile vehicles and power plants always developed one fault or the other leading to frequent visit to mechanics. In view of these preceding issues, experimental {{study was conducted to}} determine the influence of gasoline sold in Nigeria market on engine performance characteristics. Four samples of commercial gasoline were collected from different petrol stations within Omu-Aran metropolis, Kwara State, Nigeria and tested on a four stroke single cylinder spark ignition engine (P 8161) automotive test bed at wide throttle opening. However, the octane rating of the selected fuel samples could not be ascertain because gasoline supplied at Nigeria petrol stations are no longer rated {{as it used to be}} as regular, premium and regular unleaded. The results of this investigation show that the performance parameters such as torque, brake power, brake mean effective pressure and thermal efficiency for each fuel sample increase with increase engine speed up to a maximum value and begin to decrease as <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> due to frictional loss. Maximum brake power obtained with fuel sample A was 5. 751 kW at 3083 rpm. For fuel sample B, the maximum brake power was 5. 025 kW at 2884 rpm, 5. 269 kW at 2727 for fuel sample C and 5. 019 kW at 2718 rpm for fuel sample D. From this test, brake maximum power and torque occur at the same engine speed for each sample of fuel sample studied. Also the maximum power obtained from fuel sample B and D were approximately the same at different engine speed. It may suffice to say that fuel sample B and D were likely supplied to the different petrol filling stations by the same source. The minimum amount of fuel consumed in order to attain maximum power was more with fuel sample D and B corresponding to 36. 73 g/kW. hr and 36. 63 g/kW. hr respectively. The minimum brake specific fuel consumption was lower for fuel sample A and C with value 32. 21 g/kW. hr and 35. 44 g/kW. hr respectively. Therefore, it is more economical and reliable to run spark ignition engines with fuel sample A and C. Analysis of fuel variability shows that the coefficient of variation in engine speed for fuel sample A, B, C and D were 32. 6...|$|E
40|$|Optical {{engines are}} used as {{research}} and development tools to study the combustion inside internal combustion engines. Conventional optical engines uses an extended piston {{in order to be}} able to observe the combustion chamber from below, through the piston. This extended piston, or Bowditch piston, limits the load and speed in which the engine can operate due to its geometrically weak design and considerable mass. This master thesis proposes a design for a new type of optical engine that has significantly higher mechanical performance compared to conventional optical engines. The new design may provide an <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increase</b> of up to 100 %. Optical engines are often single cylinder internal combustion engines, fitted with transparent parts providing optical access to the combustion chamber. Using the optical access, various processes taking place in the combustion chamber may be studied optically which becomes more and more important in today's advanced engines, some of which are direct injected. The optical engine can be fitted with a transparent liner providing optical access from the side of the combustion chamber, together with the Bowditch piston providing access from below. These pistons are known for their high weight and low stiffness, frequently limiting engine speeds and cylinder pressures to low or moderate. For a standard optical engine with car engine specifications, maximum speeds can be around 2500 RPM. By summer 2014 Anders Dahl and Kristoffer Clasén came up with the idea of how to replace the Bowditch piston in an optical engine. By reconfiguring the conrod and crankshaft, optical access was achieved from beneath the piston rather than inside, making the piston shorter, lighter and therefore stronger. The reconfiguration also resulted in higher force absorption, which is a key feature since increasing engine speed drastically increases the piston acceleration and hence the reaction forces. The concept was consumed by Bohus Automotive AB and a master thesis in collaboration with the division of combustion at Chalmers was initiated. The work was divided in two parts; development and validation of the piston, and development of an engine comprising the piston. The aim of the piston validation was to determine a first estimate of the mechanical performance. A piston design was created using the CAD-software Inventor and an iterative approach. When the design had matured it was analysed by FEM with regard to stress, using the commercial FE-software Ansys Workbench Mechanical. Parallel to the piston an engine design was developed using the same software and iterative approach. The aim of the engine development was to establish a suitable engine layout comprising the piston concept. Without an engine, the piston has no use. Much of the engine was created using engineering intuition to be able to create a whole engine design within the project time, and the engine will need its own verification in the future. The piston analyses showed promising results, indicating a performance increase of up to 100 % in engine speed compared to the Bowditch design. Likewise, a successful engine with a compact design was established that fulfilled the demands on ease of use and accessibility. A few simplifications and assumptions have been implemented in the analyses, and more work is needed in the future to verify other components such as crankshaft and conrods. The transparent parts have been excluded from the analyses since they would inevitably limit the performance. Normally the transparent liner would be the first component to break. There is however a configuration option of the new engine that excludes the transparent liner which would allow much higher loads than usual...|$|E

40|$|Diesel engines {{which is}} an {{attractive}} power unit used widely in many fields are among the main contributors to air pollutions for {{the large amount of}} emissions, especially particulate matter (PM) and nitrogen oxides (NOx). PM {{is one of the major}} pollutants emitted by diesel engine which have adverse effects on human health. Accordingly, many research have been done to find alternative fuels that are clean and efficient. In this study, waste cooking oil (WCO) biodiesel has been used as an alternative source for diesel engine which produces lower PM than diesel fuel. The emission of PM and gaseous emission (carbon monoxide (CO), carbon dioxide (CO 2), nitric oxide (NO) and NOx) has been collected from single cylinder diesel engine fuelled with diesel and WCO biodiesel blends (B 5, B 10 B 20 and B 100) at five different engine speed (1200 rpm, 1500 rpm, 1800 rpm, 2100 rpm and 2400 rpm) with constant load of 20 Nm. The comparison between diesel and WCO biodiesel blends has been made in terms of PM characterization which is PM mass concentration, its component (soluble organic fraction (SOF) and soot) and its influence on PM formation, PM morphology and PM size distribution. In addition, combustion characteristic which is in-cylinder pressure of the engine as well as exhaust temperature also has been observed. The results show PM emission of B 100 is lower than diesel fuel with variation of 5. 56 % to 21. 82 %. This is due to oxygen content contained in B 100. As for SOF concentration, blended fuels B 10, B 20, and B 100 have higher SOF value (3. 23 % to 82. 36 %) compared to diesel fuel at moderate and high engine speed. Meanwhile, soot concentration for blended fuels B 10, B 20 and B 100 is lower (10 % to 62. 50 %.) compared to diesel fuel Observation on PM morphology shows that the images is chain-like agglomeration which is extremely small non uniform nanostructure. As for the PM size distribution, the trend were similar for diesel and WCO biodiesel blends. The size distribution of diesel fuel and WCO biodiesel blends were shifted to the larger size as the engine speed is increased. Simultaneously, the size distribution is shifted to the smaller PM diameter as blending ratio of WCO biodiesel in the fuel blend is increase. The observation of in-cylinder pressure shows uncertain trend with the WCO biodiesel ratio in the fuel blend while decreasing with the increasing engine speed due to the prolong ignition delay period. At the same time, WCO biodiesel blends gives higher value of exhaust temperature which is 1. 49 % compared to diesel fuel and it increases as the <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increase.</b> In terms of gaseous emission, increasing engine speed increased the CO, CO 2, NOx and NO emission while decrease the O 2 emission. The effect of WCO biodiesel blends on the gaseous emission shows uncertain trend while PM-NOx trade off observation shows B 100 simultaneously decrease both NOx and PM emission at the same time. This study shows that the PM and gaseous emission as well as combustion characteristic of the WCO biodiesel are comparable with diesel fuel thus WCO biodiesel has potential as an alternative fuel to be used in diesel in the future...|$|E
50|$|Spark timing, {{relative}} to piston position, {{is based on}} static (initial or base) timing without mechanical advance. The distributor's centrifugal timing advance mechanism makes the spark occur sooner as <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increases.</b> Many of these engines will also use a vacuum advance that advances timing during light loads and deceleration, independent of the centrifugal advance.

However, when <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increases,</b> the second runner is opened, decreasing airflow <b>speed,</b> but <b>increasing</b> the airflow volume, better matching the engine's airflow needs at higher revolutions.

50|$|In {{traditional}} sprung-valve actuation, as <b>engine</b> <b>speed</b> <b>increases,</b> {{the momentum}} of the valve will eventually overcome the spring's ability to close it completely before the piston reaches TDC (top dead centre). This can lead to several problems. First, and most damaging, the piston collides with the valve and both are destroyed. Second, the valve does not completely return to its seat before combustion begins. This allows combustion gases to escape prematurely, leading to a reduction in cylinder pressure which causes a major decrease in engine performance. This can also overheat the valve, possibly warping it and leading to catastrophic failure. In sprung-valve engines the traditional remedy for valve float is to stiffen the springs. This increases the seat pressure of the valve (the static pressure that holds the valve closed). This is beneficial at higher <b>engine</b> <b>speeds</b> because of a reduction in the aforementioned valve float. The drawback is that the engine has to work harder to open the valve at all <b>engine</b> <b>speeds.</b> The higher spring pressure causes greater friction (hence temperature and wear) in the valvetrain.|$|R
