Larger electric helicopters suitable <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>flight</b> and advanced aerobatics have become a reality {{over the last few}} years and have become very popular.

40|$|International audienceIn this {{contribution}} {{we investigate}} {{the problem of}} linear velocity estimation of a Gun Launched Micro Air Vehicle (GLMAV), which is a new Micro Air Vehicle (MAV) concept, intended <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>flight,</b> and using two-bladed coaxial contra-rotating rotors. The linear velocity estimation is realized using a simple time-varying Luenberger-like observer, and only using partial measurmements of an Inertial Management Unit (IMU). Simple conditions of the observation-error-asymptotic-stability are given in terms of physical variables of the GLMAV. The reduced-order observer stability analysis is realized through the Lyapunov approach and the Barbalat's lemma. Simulations results show {{the effectiveness of the}} estimation technique applied to the presented GLMAV model, identified from experimental result...|$|R
40|$|In this thesis, black-box models {{describing}} the quadcopter system dynamics for attitude control have been estimated using closed-loop data. A quadcopter is a naturally unstable {{multiple input multiple output}} (MIMO) system {{and is therefore}} an interesting platform to test and evaluate ideas in system identification and control theory on. The estimated attitude models have been shown to explain the output signals well enough during simulations to properly tune a PID controller <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>flight</b> purposes. With data collected in closed loop during <b>outdoor</b> <b>flights,</b> knowledge about the controller and IMU measurements, three decoupled models have been estimated for the angles and angular rates in roll, pitch and yaw. The models for roll and pitch have been forced to have the same model structure and orders since this reflects the geometry of the quadcopter. The models have been validated by simulating the closed-loop system where they could explain the output signals well. The estimated models have then been used to design attitude controllers to stabilize the quadcopter around the hovering state. Three PID controllers have been implemented on the quadcopter and evaluated in simulation before being tested during both indoor and <b>outdoor</b> <b>flights.</b> The controllers have been shown to stabilize the quadcopter with good reference tracking. However, the performance of the pitch controller could be improved further as there have been small oscillations present that may indicate a stronger correlation between the roll and pitch channels than assumed...|$|R
50|$|The sun conure {{is noted}} for its very loud squawks and screams {{compared}} to its relatively small size. It is capable of mimicking humans, but not {{as well as some}} larger parrots. Sun conures are popular as pets because of their bright coloration and curious nature. Due to their inquisitive temperaments, they demand {{a great deal of attention}} from their owners, with whom they can be loving and cuddly. Hand reared pets can be very friendly towards people that they are familiar with, but they may be aggressive with strangers and even territorial with visitors. Sun conures are capable of learning a great deal of tricks and can even perform in front of a live audience. They enjoy listening to music, to which they occasionally sing and dance to. Like many parrots, they are determined chewers and require toys and treats to chew on. Many owners clips their conure's wings but this is not necessary if the proper precautions are put in place. Due to environmental hazards, conures should not be allowed to fly unsupervised. Sun conures are great candidates <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> <b>flight</b> when well trained as they are loyal but risk potential must be minimized. In captivity, their lifespan ranges from 15 to 30 years.|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the design and}} construction of a quadruped robot which walks on uneven terrain. A control system which produces a statically stable gait has been implemented; results showing a straight and turning gait are presented. The control of quadruped robots poses interesting challenges due to a small stability margin (when compared to hexapods for example). For this reason most <b>implemented</b> systems <b>for</b> <b>outdoor</b> walking on uneven terrain have been hexapods. The system described here has the added virtue of using very few inexpensive sensors and actuators. One of the aims of this work {{is to build a}} reduced complexity (low power, low mass and direct drive) walking robot for statically stable walking. The other aim is to compare the performance of this robot with a wheeled robot roughly the same size and weight. In this paper we report on progress towards the first of these two goals. 1 Introduction The advantages that walking robots possess have been extolled for many years. Chief amo [...] ...|$|R

MobiGeo was <b>implemented</b> <b>for</b> an <b>outdoor</b> pedagogical activity and enrolled a group of 173 seventh grade geography students. In order to collect data, a questionnaire was developed and validated measuring three dimensions related to educational games: motivation, interaction and perceived learning. Results show that this urban game was an adequate activity to use in informal learning environments because it engaged students in gaming with high degrees of motivation and interaction. In fact, while solving the tasks proposed by MobiGeo, students´ developed their perceptions of learning, consolidating and acquiring new knowledge about the European Union.
