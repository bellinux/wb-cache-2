He is {{referred}} to in scientific publications and media reports as JSM Peiris, JS Peiris, Joseph Peiris and, most commonly, as Malik Peiris. His close family and friends prefer to use the middle name Sriyal. He is a distinguished old boy of St. Anthony's College Kandy and later studied medicine at the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, Sri Lanka. This was followed by post graduate study at the Sir William Dunn School of Pathology, University of Oxford, UK, leading to the award of the DPhil degree. After further work in the UK and Sri Lanka, he founded the clinical diagnostic and public health virology laboratory at Queen Mary Hospital, {{which is part of}} the University of Hong Kong, in 1995. Professor Peiris and his team of scientists and doctors were strategically placed to face the challenges of the Avian influenza virus outbreak, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) coronavirus outbreak and, currently, the Middle Eastern Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus outbreak. Original research carried out by the Hong Kong laboratories have made major contributions to our knowledge of the causative viruses of these diseases, and our understanding, diagnosis, treatment and prevention of the diseases that these viruses cause. During the years 2003-2004, Professor Peiris was credited with authoring the highest number of high impact publications in the scientific world.He and his co-workers have published more than 600 scientific papers in a research career spanning more than 35 years and are credited with 32 scientific patents relating to <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections.</b> [...] He currently holds the Tam Wah-Ching Professorship, Division of Public Health Laboratory Sciences, University of Hong Kong, where he continues to lead ground breaking research with a particular interest in newly emerging virus diseases at the animal-human interface.|$|E
40|$|The rapid <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections</b> is an {{important}} tool {{in the management of}} patients with infectious diseases. Solid-phase enzyme immunoassays have proved to be useful tools for the direct detection of the antigens of some viruses directly in clinical specimens. Such assays have been particularly useful in the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections</b> in the gastrointestinal and respiratory tracts. However, standard solid-phase enzyme immunoassays often do not display sufficient sensitivity for the diagnosis of all cases of viral infections. Techniques which might be utilized to increase the sensitivity of solid-phase immunoassays include the use of monoclonal antibodies to maximize the efficiency of the antigen-antibody interactions and the use of high-turnover enzymes {{to increase the amount of}} signal generated by the ensuing enzyme-substrate reactions. In addition, techniques making use of nucleic acid hybridization have a great deal of potential for the accurate detection of viral nucleic acids in human body fluids. The successful application of these techniques to the <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections</b> could lead to a marked improvement in the care of patients with suspected infectious diseases as well as to a decrease in the transmission of viral infections to high-risk individuals.

40|$|Effective {{isolation}} of nucleic acids from samples containing viral materials {{is an essential}} step for accurate <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections.</b> The necessity of this critical step before analytical identification and <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections</b> is paramount to screening programs and to identifying and monitoring epidemics and pandemics. With molecular assays rapidly evolving into routine practice, clinical laboratories face several challenges, including presence of small amounts of viral nucleic acids in abundant levels of genomic DNA and total RNA, processing of various sample types, and carry-over of polymerase chain reaction inhibitors, which could significantly affect polymerase chain reaction and microarray results. MagaZorb nucleic acid isolation technology overcomes these challenges and offers a simple and reliable method for {{isolation of}} high-quality and high-yield nucleic acids. Although the MagaZorb technology is readily adaptable to automated platforms, it is also well suited to laboratories in remote areas of resource-poor countries, because a simple magnet is the only device required to perform the procedure manually. Performance characteristics and clinical application of the MagaZorb technology are briefly described here.

Concomitant pulmonary and hepatic localization of hydatid cysts in childhood is unusual and represents a distinct clinical entity called hepatopulmonary hydatidosis. Case presentation A ten-year-old Caucasian girl, a permanent resident of rural Greece, was admitted to hospital reporting a nonspecific symptomatology compatible with a <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection.</b> Chest radiography revealed a large homogenous circular opacity in the right lung field. On the basis of imaging studies, a <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> hydatidosis was made with synchronous hepatic and pulmonary involvement, successfully managed through a single-stage transthoracic surgical approach. Conclusion This case report highlights the necessity of realizing that hydatid disease {{continues to be a}} public health problem, which often remains asymptomatic for years. Therefore, the presence of any homogeneous cystic spherical opacity on routine chest radiography should raise the suspicion of hydatid disease, mainly in endemic areas such as Greece.

40|$|Background: Emerging viral diseases, most {{of which}} are caused by the {{transmission}} of viruses from animals to humans, pose a threat to public health. Discovering pathogenic viruses through surveillance is the key to preparedness for this potential threat. Next generation sequencing (NGS) helps us to identify viruses without the design of a specific PCR primer. The major task in NGS data analysis is taxonomic identification for vast numbers of sequences. However, taxonomic identification via a BLAST search against all the known sequences is a computational bottleneck. Description: Here we propose an enhanced lowest-common-ancestor based method (ELM) to effectively identify viruses from massive sequence data. To reduce the computational cost, ELM uses a customized database composed only of viral sequences for the BLAST search. At the same time, ELM adopts a novel criterion to suppress the rise in false positive assignments caused by the small database. As a result, identification by ELM is more than 1, 000 times faster than the conventional methods without loss of accuracy. Conclusions: We anticipate that ELM will contribute to direct <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infections...</b>|$|E

All patients under the age of 18 years who underwent general anesthesia at our institution with confirmed RSV or influenza infection diagnosed within 24 hours following induction between October 2002 and September 2008 were identified. Controls were randomly selected and were matched by surgical procedure, age, and time of year in a ratio of three controls per case. The primary outcome was postoperative length of stay (LOS). Results Twenty-four patients with laboratory-confirmed RSV or influenza who underwent general anesthesia prior to <b>diagnosis</b> <b>of</b> <b>viral</b> <b>infection</b> were identified and matched to 72 controls. Thirteen cases had RSV and 11 had influenza. The median postoperative LOS was three days (intra-quartile range 1 to 8 days) for cases and two days (intra-quartile range 1 to 5 days) for controls.

We present our experience with Polyomavirus (PV) infection and CMV infection in allograft of renal transplant recipients from a transplant centre in North India performing more than 100 transplants per year. Materials and Methods: 390 renal allograft specimens from 327 patients over a 4 year period, presenting with renal dysfunction were re-evaluated for presence of PVN and CMV disease utilizing histo-morphological features and immunohistochemistry. Results: Thirteen patients with PVN and four with CMV disease were identified. All patients were on triple drug immunosuppression receiving cyclosporine, prednisolone and tacrolimus or MMF.
