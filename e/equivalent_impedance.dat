5000|$|An ideal {{voltage source}} is a two-terminal device that {{maintains}} a fixed voltage drop across its terminals. It {{is often used}} as a mathematical abstraction that simplifies the analysis of real electric circuits. If the voltage across an ideal voltage source can be specified independently of any other variable in a circuit, it is called an independent voltage source. Conversely, if the voltage across an ideal voltage source is determined by some other voltage or current in a circuit, it is called a dependent or controlled voltage source. A mathematical model of an amplifier will include dependent voltage sources whose magnitude is governed by some fixed relation to an input signal, for example.

50|$|A {{magnetic}} pickup {{consists of a}} permanent magnet with a core of material such as alnico or ferrite, wrapped with a coil of several thousand turns of fine enameled copper wire. The pickup is most often {{mounted on the body}} of the instrument, but can be attached to the bridge, neck or pickguard, as on many electro-acoustic archtop jazz guitars. Magnetic pickups used with string basses can be attached to the bridge. The permanent magnet creates a magnetic field; the motion of the vibrating steel strings disturbs the field, changing magnetic flux and inducing an electric current through the coil. The pickup is then connected with a patch cable to an amplifier which amplifies the signal to a sufficient magnitude of power to drive a loudspeaker. A pickup can also be connected to recording equipment via a patch cable. There may also be an internal preamplifier device mounted in an acoustic guitar or in an external box. When a preamp is used in this way, it is between the pickup and cable and can significantly reduce the <b>equivalent</b> <b>impedance</b> of the pickup coil.|$|E
