500|$|During an {{interview}} with V, Cyrus and producer Pharrell Williams revealed that they considered servicing [...] "#GetItRight" [...] as the lead single from the record, though [...] "We Can't Stop" [...] was ultimately chosen. [...] "#GetItRight" [...] is a pop-funk song; it was written and produced by Pharrell Williams. According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Kobalt Music Publishing America, the track is written in the key of F major with a tempo of 116 beats per minute. Mariah Eakin of The A.V. Club noted the incorporation of [...] "whistling choruses and whimsical sing-alongs", while Nick Catucci from Entertainment Weekly recognized {{the use of a}} [...] "scratchy funk guitar"; he further stated that the lyrics [...] "Would you believe I'm dancing in the mirror? / I feel like <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>no</b> panties on / I wish that I could feel ya / Now hurry, hang up that damn phone!'" [...] address the desire of an [...] "absent lover". Evan Sawdey of PopMatters felt that its production was similar to that of [...] "Starships" [...] by Nicki Minaj.|$|E
500|$|The {{band members}} {{began to have}} doubts about the record's sound. [...] During this time, Cobain admitted, [...] "The first time I played it at home, I knew there was {{something}} wrong. [...] The whole first week I wasn't really interested in listening to it at all, and that usually doesn't happen. [...] <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>no</b> emotion from it, I was just numb." [...] The group concluded that the bass and lyrics were inaudible and approached Albini to remix the album. [...] The producer declined; as he recalled, [...] " [...] wanted to make a record that he could slam down on the table and say, 'Listen, I know this is good, and I know your concerns about it are meaningless, so go with it.' [...] And I don't think he felt he had that yet... My problem was that I feared a slippery slope." [...] The band attempted to fix its concerns with the record during the mastering process with Bob Ludwig at his studio in Portland, Maine. [...] Novoselic was pleased with the results, but Cobain still did not feel the sound was perfect.|$|E

Latif {{wrote a letter to}} the ICC citing his concerns back in 2003,"In that letter, I told them to change the rules and laws in one-day internationals which, were more prone to spot-fixing. I even offered to assist the ICC's Anti-Corruption and Security Unit but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>no</b> response," [...] he said.|$|E

On 26 November, in an interview with Robin Oakley on Radio 4, he said [...] "To be honest I found it intellectually numbing, and tedious in the extreme. I most certainly won't miss the constituency work. I've got to tell you that honestly. It's 22 years of the same cases, but just the faces and the people changing. It might sound a little disparaging to say this about people's lives and their problems and we did deal with them ... but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>no</b> satisfaction from this at all. I really didn't. And all you were was a sort of high-powered social worker and perhaps not even a good one at that. I will miss being chairman of the works of art committee [...] [...] [...] because I was having so much intellectual enjoyment, and indeed just straightforward fun, out of reorganising our collection, and that kept me in touch with history." ...|$|E
2500|$|By 1933, West {{was one of}} {{the largest}} box office draws in the United States and, by 1935, West was also the highest paid woman and the second-highest paid person in the United States (after William Randolph Hearst). Hearst invited West to San Simeon, California. [...] "I could'a married him," [...] West explained, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>no</b> time for parties. I don't like those big crowds." [...] On July 1, 1934, the {{censorship}} of the Production Code began to be seriously and meticulously enforced, and her screenplays were heavily edited. West would purposely place over-the-top lines in her scripts, knowing the censors would cut them out. She hoped they would then not object as much to her other lines. Her next film was Belle of the Nineties (1934). The original titled, It Ain't No Sin, was changed due to the censors' objections. Despite Paramount's early objections regarding costs, she insisted the studio hire Duke Ellington and his orchestra to accompany her in the film's musical numbers. Their collaboration was a success; the classic [...] "My Old Flame" [...] (recorded by Duke Ellington) was introduced in this picture. Her next film, Goin' to Town (1935), received mixed reviews, as censorship continued to take its toll in eroding West's best lines.|$|E
