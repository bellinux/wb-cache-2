5|$|Despite his success, Cagney {{remained}} {{dissatisfied with}} his contract. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> {{money for his}} successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney {{announced that he would}} do his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood and go back to Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney's salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.|$|E
5|$|For Seiken Densetsu 3, Kikuta was {{assisted}} by a sound programmer, Hidenori Suzuki, which {{allowed him to}} compose over three {{times the amount of}} music he had created for Secret of Mana. The move to the PlayStation for Soukaigi allowed Kikuta to focus on creating live music for the soundtrack, rather than tweaking the synthesizer instruments to make the music files fit in the game cartridge as he had to for the Super Nintendo. He used the added audio processing power to expand his musical creativity, including pieces such as songs in unintelligible Thai and Malaysian by Japanese singers. The game itself, however, was not a success, and Kikuta decided that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> direct control over the next project he worked on.|$|E

5|$|The first {{plans for}} an airport serving Notodden were {{launched}} in 1954 by Reidar Hedwig-Dahl, director of the tourist office. In late 1954 or early 1955, he held a meeting with Ludvig G. Braathen, owner of Braathens SAFE, and representatives for his airline. They saw Notodden as a possible gateway to Telemark and Braathen promised to start flying to an airport serving Notodden, should one be built. At the time, Braathen had started flying to several smaller airports in Norway using a fleet of de Havilland Heron aircraft. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning. He succeeded at having similar airports built in Hamar and Røros.|$|E
25|$|The {{initiative}} {{to build an}} airport in Røros was taken {{by a group of}} individuals in 1954, with Olav Bergersen as the most enthusiastic. They contacted Braathens SAFE and asked if they were interested in operating flights out of the town. The airline had recently gained the right to fly between Oslo Airport, Fornebu and Trondheim Airport, Værnes, and was therefore asked if they would be interested in making a stop-over for some of their services in Røros. Ludvig G. Braathen had been traveling around Norway and encouraging municipalities to build regional airports, stating that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> but smaller airports than the central authorities were planning.

25|$|Poitier {{began to}} be criticized for being typecast as over-idealized African American {{characters}} who were not permitted to have any sexuality or personality faults, such as his character in Guess Who's Coming To Dinner. Poitier was aware of this pattern himself, but was conflicted on the matter. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> varied roles; but he also felt obliged {{to set an example}} with his characters, by challenging old stereotypes as he was the only major actor of African descent being cast in leading roles in the American film industry, at that time. For instance, in 1966, he turned down an opportunity to play the lead in an NBC television production of Othello with that spirit in mind.|$|E

25|$|Hagen {{was elected}} into {{parliament}} for seven consecutive four-year periods from 1981, until {{he stepped down}} and {{decided not to run}} for the 2009 election. In the periods from 1979 to 1982, 1987 to 1991 and 1995 to 1999 he was {{also a member of the}} Oslo city council. In 2005, Hagen was chosen as Vice President of the Storting, and held the position until he left parliament in 2009. In 2006 he stepped down as party leader in favour of Siv Jensen. Part of the decision not to run for re-election (which he had made in 2007) apart from reaching the age of pension, was because Hagen had felt that he had been put on the sideline after retiring as party leader. He also said that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> relaxation, and to work as a consultant. After ending his high-profile political career, he started working for the PR agency Burson-Marsteller in 2009, where he became among the company's highest paid lecturers.|$|E
25|$|During {{the evening}} of 27 July, Hobart was {{involved}} in another friendly fire incident; this time, shells from the ship fell close to a marine unit's command post and injured three marines. The fault {{was found to be}} with the marine unit's spotter, who was inexperienced, failed to signal the close proximity of friendly units to the target, and failed to fully identify the target before calling for five rounds of shellfire. Although Hobart was asked to rotate Sea Dragon duties on 2 August to relieve a destroyer experiencing gunnery faults, nine days early, the destroyer's captain refused, as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> time to prepare the ship after the repairs, particularly as the air warning radars were yet to become operational, and the gun mounts were experiencing minor problems. The Sea Dragon deployment did not eventuate, and after operating near the Demilitarized Zone, Hobart was reassigned to gunfire support duties around southern Vietnam on 12 August. On 22 August, the destroyer fired to support the 1st Australian Task Force in Phuoc Tuy Province: the first time a RAN destroyer provided naval gunfire support for Australian soldiers in the war. On 29 September, Perth relieved Hobart at Subic, and Hobart sailed for home. One sailor was awarded a Distinguished Service Medal for his actions during the 17 June attack (the government received advice that as it was a friendly fire incident, a non-combat medal like the British Empire Medal should be awarded instead, but this was ignored), while two Mentions in Despatches and 23 Naval Board commendations were also issued.|$|E

Jackson's father Joseph also approved of the project and allowed him to record it on the condition that it didn't interfere with group business.

500|$|Before {{the end of}} the war, {{the club}} {{approached}} Matt Busby, who had just turned down the opportunity to join the coaching staff at Liverpool, on the grounds that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> responsibility over the playing side of the club than merely the selection of the team. United allowed Busby the responsibilities he requested, and in his first five seasons in charge he guided the team to four second-place finishes in the league, before finally winning his first title in 1952. He soon set about replacing many of the more experienced players with a group of youths who {{came to be known as}} the [...] "Busby Babes". This team went on to win two league titles in 1955–56 and 1956–57, as well as reaching two FA Cup finals. Unfortunately, the careers of many of the players were cut short by the Munich air disaster, which also left Busby fighting for his life.|$|E
500|$|The T206 Honus Wagner {{baseball}} card {{depicts the}} Pittsburgh Pirates' Honus Wagner, a dead-ball era baseball player who {{is widely considered}} {{to be one of}} the best players of all time. The card was designed and issued by the American Tobacco Company (ATC) from 1909 to 1911 as part of its T206 series. Wagner refused to allow production of his baseball card to continue, either because he did not want children to buy cigarette packs to get his card, or because <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> compensation from the ATC. The ATC ended production of the Wagner card and a total of only 50 to 200 cards were ever distributed to the public (exact number unknown), as compared to the [...] "tens or hundreds of thousands" [...] of T206 cards, over three years in sixteen brands of cigarettes, for any other player. In 1933, the card was first listed at a price value of US$50 in Jefferson Burdick's The American Card Catalog, making it the most expensive baseball card in the world at the time.|$|E
500|$|Friday was {{watched by}} other clubs {{throughout}} November and December 1976, but although he performed well in some games, including a 1–1 draw away at Crystal Palace on 6 November {{in which he}} scored his team's only goal, he was poor in others. After being marked {{out of the game}} during Reading's 4–0 loss away against Mansfield Town on 8 November, he was substituted. [...] "Coincidence or not", wrote the Evening Post, [...] "when Friday left, so did half a dozen managers and scouts". Friday was so angry at his team's performance that he broke into the Mansfield dressing room and defecated in the team bath. Reading's asking price stood at £50,000, and the first transfer offer came from Second Division side Cardiff City around mid-December. Cardiff boss Jimmy Andrews bid £28,000, half of his offer a year before, which Reading's directors accepted, wanting the troublesome player off their hands as quickly as possible. Friday was reluctant to go to the Welsh club, saying that it was too far from home, that {{he wanted to go to}} a First Division team and that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>more</b> money than was being offered; however, when Hurley told him that unless he went to Cardiff he would be released, he agreed and travelled to Wales on 30 December 1976.|$|E
