40|$|Summary: Nanosized ZnO {{thin films}} were {{prepared}} both on Si(111) and alumina substrates by {{the method of}} DC magnetron sputtering. Annealing was carried out, at different temperature respectively. The structure of unannealed and annealed thin films were studied by XRD,the infection of annealing temperature on sensing properties of ZnO thin films was analysed. After 700 ℃ annealing the sample showed excellent selectivity and highest sensitivity towards acetone, and the response and recover time were short,the best working temperature was 220 ℃. ZnO is an important <b>sensitive</b> <b>semiconductor</b> <b>gas</b> material, it belongs to surface-controlled gas sensors, which has been developed as early as in the 60 s. Compare to another two series of metal oxide gas sensing materials SnO 2 and Fe 2 O 3, ZnO is more stable. But its sensitivity is lower and its working temperature is higher, moreover, its selectivity isn’t good[1]. Therefore, the improvement of ZnO <b>gas</b> <b>sensitive</b> materials mainly focuses on raising sensitivity, improving selectivity, lowering temperature {{and other aspects of}} the work. ZnO films have a certain potential market and good industrical prospect. At present,these methods that have been reported such as precious metals, rare earth doped oxide composite doped, surface modification have achieved good progress[2 ~ 5]. Our laboratory prepared ZnO thin films by DC magnetron sputtering, and annealed at different temperatures.

These applications often require <b>sensitive</b> <b>gas</b> detection in a range of environments. An effective sensing approach to meet the needs of these applications is a Schottky diode based on a SiC semiconductor. The primary advantage of using SiC as a semiconductor is its inherent stability and capability to operate at a wide range of temperatures. The complete SiC Schottky diode gas sensing structure includes both the SiC <b>semiconductor</b> and <b>gas</b> <b>sensitive</b> thin film metal layers; reliable operation of the SiC-based gas sensing structure requires good control of the interface between these <b>gas</b> <b>sensitive</b> layers and the SiC.

The layout design and a schematic symbol have also been generated in Cadence -thus creating a resistive polymeric cell {{that can be used in}} the general design of smart ASIC based systems. The top cell comprises several sub-cells allowing versatility and adaptability in implementation through its modular structure.

40|$|A {{fundamental}} {{limitation of}} many chemically <b>sensitive</b> organic <b>semiconductor</b> materials is their high susceptibility to cross-interference resulting from interactions with background species {{other than those}} actively being detected. Such cross-sensitivities often preclude their use in 'real' sensor applications, particularly where discrete and selective gas sensing systems are required. It has been hypothesised, however, that this lack of specificity can largely be overcome with {{the adoption of a}} multi-element sensor array, thereby allowing the compensation of unwanted sensitivities through suitable signal processing. This thesis describes how such a multi-element sensor array of different <b>gas</b> <b>sensitive</b> metallophthalocyanine films, constructed on a single substrate, was used as the sensing element in an 'intelligent' chemical sensor. Since the individual sensors show varying degrees of gas sensitivity, the individual responses of each to any particular analyte will give rise to a characteristic change in the output 'pattern' comprised of each of the sensor resistances. By monitoring the change in this pattern of responses on exposure to specific gases of pre-determined concentration and employing a suitable feature extraction algorithm, the characteristic responses to particular analytes was learnt, and a knowledge base, from which future inferences may be drawn, was constructed. The success of suitable signal processing techniques to accommodate the inherent cross-sensitivities exhibited by these materials is demonstrated. The results demonstrate the viability of pattern recognition methods to analyse gas mixtures by comparing particular features of the combined array response with those previously learnt during a gas recognition training phase...|$|R
