The first production aircraft flew in 1993, {{four years after the}} prototype. [...] After receiving Russian certification at the end of 2001 and JAR/FAR certification a few months later, the Korvet sold quite well, with 60 built by the end of February 2002. [...] An early Korvet 582 was sold in the Philippines, then bought by the Vietnamese and used {{as a model for the}} locally built A41 Factory VNS-41. Two Korvet-Js went to Cuba in military markings in 2008. Another Korvet-J was equipped for <b>Earth</b> <b>resource</b> <b>survey</b> with large underwing aerials; after successful trials these aerials were internally accommodated.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA problem of routing <b>earth</b> <b>resource</b> <b>survey</b> aircraft, proposed by NASA, is formulated as a traveling salesman problem, {{in which the}} salesman (aircraft) has a range constraint. A heuristic algorithm is presented, which seeks a minimal length set of subtours through n cities. The aircraft begins a subtour at the base location, visits {{a subset of the}} n cities and returns when the range constraint prevents a visit to another city. Additional subtours are created until all cities are visited. The algorithm is programmed in FORTBAN for use on digital computers. The IBM 360 / 67 computer at the Naval Postgraduate School was used to find solutions to three operational problems of size seven, eighteen and twenty-five cities. Computation times for each problem was under 20 seconds and the solutions were significantly better than feasible solutions calculated without the use of the algorithm. [URL] United States Arm...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{propose a}} new lossy {{compression}} approach for hyperspectral images {{which comes from}} hadamard transform (HT) spectral imager for space-based surveillance that uses the Digital Micro-mirror Device (DMD) as the programmable mask other than the conventional mechanical mask. This paper firstly introduces that the DMD Hadamard spectrometer described in this paper is good at obtaining multi-channel high-energy high-SNR spectral data, which is superior to traditional ones. And then,based on the hardware platform composed of Xilinx FPGA and ADV 212 (a codec chip for special JPEG 2000), the sampled image data was then compressed with high SNR,high-resolution compression ratio. Last, we show the experimental results which demonstrate that the PSNR is up to 47. 3 dB and make no significant distortion for vision. Obviously, this approach takes distinguished advantages on real-time ability, image distortion and the practical value. The design can be utilized in national defense, <b>earth</b> <b>resource</b> <b>survey</b> aerospace, environmental disaster monitoring and other fields...|$|E

40|$|We review {{research}} {{developments on}} satellite detection of the convection generated stresses in the Earth for seismic hazard assessment and <b>Earth</b> <b>resource</b> <b>survey.</b> Particular emphasis is laid upon recent progress and results of stress calculations {{from which the}} origin and evolution of the tectonic features on Earth's surface can be scientifically addressed. An {{important aspect of the}} recent research development in tectonic stresses relative to earthquakes is the implications for earthquake forecasting and prediction. We have demonstrated that earthquakes occur on the ring of fire around the Pacific in response to the tectonic stresses induced by mantle convection. We propose a systematic global assessment of the seismic hazard based on variations of tectonic stresses in the Earth as observed by satellites. This space geodynamic approach for assessing the seismic hazard is unique in that it can pinpoint the triggering stresses for large earthquakes without ambiguities of geological structures, fault geometries, and other tectonic properties. Also, it is distinct from the probabilistic seismic hazard assessment models in the literature, which are based only on extrapolations of available earthquake data...|$|E
40|$|The first {{recorded}} balloon ascension in America {{took place on}} June 19, 1784, when an unmanned balloon {{was raised in a}} public demonstration at Bladensburg, Maryland. On June 24, 1784, a thirteen-year-old boy ascended in the same balloon. The history of actual flight during the nineteenth century was entirely concerned with balloons except for several gliders and models leading to the coming of the airship and the aircraft. The history of practical flight in America begins in the twentieth century. The described developments related to aerostatics are concerned with balloons, rigid airships, and blimps. In a review of the evolution of aeronautics, attention is given to general aviation and its search for a market, trends in military aeronautics, and commercial aviation. It is pointed out that American air transport had its birth on New Year's Day, 1914, at Tampa Bay, Florida. The evolution of astronautics during the period from 1957 to 1976 is also examined, taking into account scientific satellites, the Apollo project, the exploration of the planets with the aid of unmanned spacecraft, strategic reconnaissance satellites, missile alarm satellites, instrumental satellites for detecting nuclear and thermonuclear explosions, weather satellites, communications satellites, and <b>earth</b> <b>resource</b> <b>survey</b> and geodetic satellites...|$|E
