5|$|During {{a raid on}} the {{northern}} Italian city of Verona on 12 October 1944, Raw's aircraft was hit by two anti-aircraft shells that destroyed its hydraulics system and an engine, wounded the radio operator and opened 166 holes in the fuselage. Despite this damage, Raw was able to return the B-24 safely to its base. He suffered frostbite to <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>as</b> damage to the plane's nose caused icy winds to enter the cockpit.|$|E
5|$|Setting {{up her own}} {{publishing}} house Marsden House, Karen is relying on useless Ramona as personal assistant. Adam is determined to take things one step further with Tina so they can move in with one another, though she doesn't want to rush things and especially not with David now living with Adam and Matthew following his divorce from Robyn. Pete has landed on <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>as</b> a chauffeur, and Jenny is finding herself seeing a lot less of her husband. Matthew's relationship with Olivia is taken to the next level, to the shock of Karen and Adam.|$|E
5|$|Once there, {{they are}} {{introduced}} to and begin {{to stay at the}} guesthouse of Kodandaram, an avid hunter, the neighbor and friend of Diganth's grandfather. Kodandaram, now handicapped from a hunting accident and confined to a wheelchair, lives with his wife Padma, daughter-in-law Sowmya, and daughters Radha and Pavani. Sowmya is widowed and teaches the village children; Radha, a student of Ayurveda, practices it alongside looking over the family's farming land; and Pavani is a student doing her pre-university course. Ganesh, a foodie, is fascinated with learning of Kodandaram's hunting spoils and persuades him to join them in hunting the very wild boar that left his legs crippled two years ago. At the forest, Kodandaram accidentally shoots Diganth in the chest, but is saved by a gong he had worn around his neck. They embark on another and final venture to kill the boar. As the boar approaches a rifle-wielding and wheelchair-bound Kodandaram, he gets up on <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>as</b> an impulse and refuses to shoot it, thankful for bringing him back to his feet again, and calls it an incarnation of varaha.|$|E

5|$|In his prime, Buffon was a talented, complete, aggressive, {{and often}} instinctive goalkeeper, who was {{recognised}} for his speed, prowess, and anticipation when coming off his line in {{one on one}} situations, {{as well as his}} confidence, goalkeeping technique, reactions, and ability to get to ground quickly to collect, parry, or even challenge for the ball with his feet; when playing in teams that relied upon high defensive lines, he often functioned as a sweeper-keeper, frequently rushing out of his area to clear the ball or face opponents who had beaten the offside trap. He was also highly regarded for his handling, aerial ability, and command of the area; however, throughout his career, Buffon has occasionally been accused by pundits of being overly cautious on high balls and of not always coming out to collect crosses, and has also drawn criticism for preferring to punch the ball out to his team-mates at times rather than holding on to it. Although not as adept with the ball at <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>as</b> the newer generation of goalkeepers that emerged in his later career, Buffon also possesses good footwork, as well as reliable distribution, which allows him to play the ball out from the back on the ground to his defenders and start swift counter-attacks, or find his teammates further up the pitch or out on the wing with deeper kicks with his right foot; in his youth, his ball skills occasionally led him to take on opponents, whenever he was put under pressure by on-running strikers.|$|E
5|$|Vaikuntha Chaturmurti is {{generally}} depicted standing. He wears rich clothes (generally in sculpture, only a dhoti) {{as well as}} various ornaments like a crown, armbands, necklaces etc., symbolic of royalty and the yagnopavita (sacred thread). In his eight arms, he is prescribed in the texts to carry gada (mace), sword, arrow and the Sudarshana Chakra in his left hands and shankha (conch), shield, bow and lotus in his right hands. However, in sculpture, he is often four-armed and in two of his hands, he holds a lotus and a conch, while his other hands rest on the heads of his personified weapons (ayudhapurusha) - Gadadevi or Gadanari (gada as a female) on his right and Chakrapurusha on his left, who stand as small figures besides his legs. They both look upwards towards him and hold fly whisks. A tiny figurine of the earth goddess Prithvi (who associated with Varaha and Vishnu as his consort) rises from the pedestal in between <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>as</b> though supporting the deity. A short dagger or sword may be tucked up in the waist belt of the god near the right hip, a peculiar feature of Kashmir icons. Attendants or devotees may be also shown besides or below Vishnu. Sometimes, Brahma and Shiva and the ten avatars of Vishnu may be depicted in the background.|$|E

25|$|The game ended 1–0, with Brooking stooping to {{head home}} a goal {{he would have}} {{probably}} more easily scored with <b>his</b> <b>feet,</b> <b>as</b> the second division side more than held its own.

25|$|Messner {{had chosen}} a new {{variation}} of the route up the North Face. Because {{there was still a}} lot of snow {{at the time of the}} expedition, Messner and Mutschlechner made very slow progress. In addition, the sheer difficulty of the climb forced the two mountaineers to use fixed ropes. Finally, on 6 May, Messner, Mutschlechner and Ang Dorje stood on the summit. There, Mutschlechner suffered frostbite to his hands, and later to <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>as</b> well. Whilst bivouacking during the descent, the tent tore away from Mutschlechner and Messner, and Messner also fell ill. He was suffering from amoebic liver abscess, making him very weak. In the end he only made it back to base camp with Mutschlechner's help.|$|E

500|$|Although well {{received}} upon its premiere, critical opinion {{as to the}} merit of The Wood Nymph has varied. Following the 1895 premiere, Oskar Merikanto, writing in Päivälehti, praised Sibelius for having [...] "masterfully" [...] recreated Rydberg's plot {{with the use of}} [...] "unique and fascinating colors", while critic Karl Flodin complained in Nya Pressen that it was [...] "unquestionably too long". Modern day opinion has been similarly equivocal. While conceding that The Wood Nymph contains [...] "some splendid melodic ideas" [...] and [...] "luxuriant scoring", Erik Tawaststjerna has characterized the work as the [...] "experiment" [...] of a composer [...] "still trying to find <b>his</b> <b>feet</b> <b>as</b> a tone-poet", suggesting that Sibelius is too dependent on the source material's narrative structure. Murtomäki, though praising the ballade for its [...] "unforced freshness of vision and tonal audacity" [...] and [...] "well elaborated, original and inventive characters", agrees with Tawaststjerna that The Wood Nymph is too episodic in construction: ...|$|E

His neighing terrifies the people. Krishna challenges Keshi to a duel, as the horse is creating havoc around Gokula. Keshi roars like a lion and charges towards Krishna, striking him with his hooves. Krishna catches hold of Keshi's two legs and tosses him to a great distance. Recovering from the fall, the agitated Keshi opens his mouth and attacks Krishna. As soon as Krishna thrusts his left arm into Keshi's mouth, all of Keshi's teeth fall. [...] Krishna's arm expands, and Keshi chokes to death, as sweat flows from his body, his eyes roll and he struggles kicking <b>his</b> <b>feet.</b> <b>As</b> Keshi falls lifeless on the ground, assuming his true demon form, the gods and Narada extol Krishna.

In 1886, Eminescu suffered a nervous breakdown and was treated by Romanian doctors, in particular Julian Bogdan and Panait Zosin. Immediately diagnosed with syphilis, after being hospitalized in a nervous diseases hospice within the Neamț Monastery, the poet is treated with mercury. Firstly, massages in Botoșani, applied by Dr. Itszak, and then in Bucharest at Dr. Alexandru A. Suțu's sanatorium, where between February–June 1889 he was injected with mercuric chloride. Professor Doctor Irinel Popescu, corresponding member of the Romanian Academy and president of the Academy of Medical Sciences of Romania, states that Eminescu died because of mercury poisoning. He also says that the poet was [...] "treated" [...] by a group of incompetent doctors and held in misery, which also shortened his life. Mercury was prohibited as treatment of syphilis in Western Europe in the 19th century, because of its adverse effects.|$|E
