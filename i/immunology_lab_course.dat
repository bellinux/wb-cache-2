40|$|The Department of Microbiology and Immunology at McGill University is in {{the process}} of {{redesigning}} a core <b>immunology</b> <b>lab</b> <b>course</b> for third year undergraduate student. This course currently uses traditional instructional strategies: didactic lectures and guided “cookbook” labs. We are redesigning this course so that it reflects modern scientific methodologies and evidence-based educational approaches. We have developed learning outcomes based on key competencies and content knowledge in our discipline, and are using these to guide the development of instructional strategies and assessments. The new lab course will feature a problem-based learning approach that will allow students to formulate their own hypothesis and design and carry out an experiment using the reagents at their disposal. The problems that will form the basis of student-designed experiments are being developed through an iterative process. We are soliciting feedback from an advisory group of undergraduate students throughout the phases of this project. Our short 2 ̆ 6 tweet presentation will aim to 1) share our experience in redesigning an <b>immunology</b> <b>lab</b> <b>course,</b> 2) hear your experiences with problem- or inquiry-based lab courses and 3) generate ideas on approaches to redesign labs that actively engage students...|$|E

40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{the impact of}} taking an associated <b>lab</b> <b>course</b> on the scores on final exam questions in two large introductory physics courses. Approximately {{a third of the}} students who completed each course also took an accompanying instructional <b>lab</b> <b>course.</b> The <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> were fairly conventional, although they focused on supporting the mastery of a subset of the introductory physics topics covered in the associated course. Performance between students who did and did not take the <b>lab</b> <b>course</b> was compared using final exam questions from the associated courses that related to concepts from the <b>lab</b> <b>courses.</b> The population of students who took the lab in each case was somewhat different from those who did not enroll in the <b>lab</b> <b>course</b> in terms of background and major. Those differences were taken into account by normalizing their performance on the lab-related questions with scores on the exam questions that did not involve material covered in the lab. When normalized in this way, the average score on lab-related questions of the students who took the <b>lab,</b> in both <b>courses,</b> was within 1 % of the score of students who did not, with an uncertainty of 2 %. This result raises questions as to the effectiveness of labs at supporting mastery of physics content. Comment: Accepted for publication in the American Journal of Physics (August 2015...|$|R

40|$|The physics {{community}} explores {{and explains}} {{the physical world}} through a blend of theoretical and experimental studies. The future of physics as a discipline depends on training of students in both the theoretical and experimental aspects of the field. However, while student learning within lecture courses {{has been the subject}} of extensive research, <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> remain relatively under-studied. In particular, there is little, if any, data available that address the effectiveness of physics <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> at encouraging students to recognize the nature and importance of experimental physics within the discipline as a whole. To address this gap, we present the first large-scale, national study (N_{institutions}= 75 and N_{students}= 7167) of undergraduate physics <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> through analysis of students’ responses to a research-validated assessment designed to investigate students’ beliefs about the nature of experimental physics. We find that students often enter and leave physics <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> with ideas about experimental physics as practiced in their courses that are inconsistent with the views of practicing experimental physicists, and this trend holds at both the introductory and upper-division levels. Despite this inconsistency, we find that both introductory and upper-division students are able to accurately predict the expertlike response even in cases where their views about experimentation in their <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> disagree. These finding have implications for the recruitment, retention, and adequate preparation of students in physics...|$|R
40|$|Instructional labs {{are widely}} seen as a unique, albeit expensive, way to teach {{scientific}} content. We measured the effectiveness of introductory <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> at achieving this educational goal across nine different <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> at three very different institutions. These institutions and courses encompassed {{a broad range of}} student populations and instructional styles. The nine courses studied had two key things in common: the labs aimed to reinforce the content presented in lectures, and the labs were optional. By comparing the performance of students who did and did not take the labs (with careful normalization for selection effects), we found universally and precisely no added value to learning course content from taking the labs as measured by course exam performance. This work should motivate institutions and departments to reexamine the goals and conduct of their <b>lab</b> <b>courses,</b> given their resource-intensive nature. We show why these results make sense when looking at the comparative mental processes of students involved in research and instructional labs, and offer alternative goals and instructional approaches that would make <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> more educationally valuable...|$|R

40|$|Lecture {{topics in}} Computer Organization courses offered by {{different}} Universities {{around the world}} do not differ significantly. This is because, in general, lecturers use the same textbooks and are inspired by common curriculum sources. However, <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> and project assignments require more and more expensive resources (computers, assemblers or assembler simulators, logic circuit simulators, …) This fact, together with the rapid advance of these tools, causes <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> to widely differ among universities.

In addition to describing participants' instructional practices, we characterize their perceptions {{about the role of}} troubleshooting in electronics, the importance of the ability to troubleshoot more generally, and what it means for students to be competent troubleshooters. One major finding of this work is that, while almost all instructors in our study said that troubleshooting is an important learning outcome for students in electronics <b>lab</b> <b>courses,</b> only half of instructors said they directly assessed students' ability to troubleshoot.

40|$|Learning {{geography}} online {{is becoming}} an option for more students but not without controversy. Issues of faculty resources, logistics, professional recognition, and pedagogical concerns are cited as barriers to teaching online. Offering introductory physical geography online presents special challenges.

40|$|Improving students’ {{understanding}} of the nature of experimental physics is often an explicit or implicit goal of undergraduate laboratory physics <b>courses.</b> However, <b>lab</b> activities in traditional <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> are typically characterized by highly structured, guided labs that often do not require or encourage students to engage authentically in the process of experimental physics. Alternatively, open-ended laboratory activities can provide a more authentic learning environment by, for example, allowing students to exercise greater autonomy in what and how physical phenomena are investigated. Engaging in authentic practices may be a critical part of improving students’ beliefs around the nature of experimental physics. Here, we investigate the impact of open-ended activities in undergraduate <b>lab</b> <b>courses</b> on students’ epistemologies and expectations about the nature of experimental physics, as well as their confidence and affect, as measured by the Colorado Learning Attitudes about Science Survey for Experimental Physics (E-CLASS). Using a national data set of student responses to the E-CLASS, we find that the inclusion of some open-ended lab activities in a <b>lab</b> <b>course</b> correlates with more expertlike postinstruction responses relative to courses that include only traditional guided lab activities. This finding holds when examining postinstruction E-CLASS scores while controlling for the variance associated with preinstruction scores, course level, student major, and student gender...|$|R
