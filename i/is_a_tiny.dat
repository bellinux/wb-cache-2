5|$|The {{black bean}} aphid is a small, soft-bodied insect that has {{specialised}} {{piercing and sucking}} mouthparts which are used to suck the juice from plants. This aphid is usually seen in large numbers and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny,</b> plump insect about two millimetres long with a small head and bulbous abdomen. The body is blackish or dark green in colour. Many adults are devoid of wings, a state known as aptery. Winged forms, known as alates, are longer and more slender than aptates and have shiny black heads and thoraxes. The membranous wings of the alates are held angled over the body. The antennae are less {{than two-thirds of the}} length of the body and both they and the legs are pale yellow in colour with black tips. The tibiae of the hind legs are swollen in egg-laying females. Near the rear of the abdomen are a pair of slender, elongated tubes known as cornicles or siphunculi. Their function is the production of a defensive waxy secretion. They are twice as long as the finger-like tail and both are brownish-black.|$|E

25|$|Oonops domesticus <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> spider (males about 1.5mm, females 2mm) from Western Europe to Russia. It is of a bleak light red, with {{a reddish}} to whitish abdomen.

The translucent flat egg sac contains only two eggs.|$|E
25|$|In {{the fourth}} century AD, Theon of Alexandria {{produced}} an edition of Euclid which was so widely used that it became the only surviving source until François Peyrard's 1808 discovery at the Vatican of a manuscript not derived from Theon's. This manuscript, the Heiberg manuscript, is from a Byzantine workshop around 900 and {{is the basis of}} modern editions.

25|$|Oonops pulcher <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> spider (males about 1½mm, females 2mm). Its six {{eyes are}} located closely together, giving the {{impression}} of only one eye. The spider is of a bleak light red, with a reddish to whitish abdomen, and found out of doors in bird nests, under stones and under tree bark, also in webs of Amaurobius and Coelotes (two spider genera from the Amaurobiidae family). Only two eggs are laid into a flat eggsac.|$|E

A second specimen, the holotype of Epidendrosaurus ninchengensis (IVPP V12653), also shows features indicating it was a juvenile. The specimen is partially disarticulated, and most bones are preserved as impressions in the rock slab, rather than three-dimensional structures. Because the only known specimens are juvenile, the size of a full-grown Scansoriopteryx is unknownthe {{type specimen}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny,</b> sparrow-sized creature.|$|E
25|$|A related {{speculation}} by Sagan and Newman {{suggests that}} if other civilizations exist, and are transmitting and exploring, their signals and probes simply have not arrived yet. However, critics have noted that this is unlikely, since it requires that humanity's advancement has occurred at a very special point in time, while the Milky Way is in transition from empty to full. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> fraction of the lifespan of a galaxy under ordinary assumptions and calculations resulting from them, so the likelihood {{that we are in}} the midst of this transition is considered low in the paradox.|$|E
25|$|The city of Melrose {{is located}} seven {{miles north of}} Boston.

The city is also served by the MBTA. Service includes five bus routes: 106, 131, 132, 136 and 137. There are three commuter rail stations: Wyoming Hill, Melrose/Cedar Park, and Melrose Highlands. Oak Grove, the northern terminus of the MBTA's Orange Line subway system, is located in Malden on the Melrose city line. Oak Grove is primarily a park-and-ride station with 788 parking spaces.|$|E

25|$|Lakkundi in Gadag {{district}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> {{village on}} the way to Hospet from Hubli. It is one of the fine architectural feasts of the Kalyana Chalukya period (about 10th century). Currently Lakkundi has about 50 temples of various stature and antiquity. All the temples are made of green schist and the outer walls and entrances are very richly decorated. The shikhara is an in-between-style type and the parapet and the artistic division of the wall with pilasters is typical of the south-Indian style. It is also known for Step wells and historic inscriptions. The centre of cultural and temple building activity lay in the Tungabhadra region, where large medieval workshops built numerous monuments. These monuments, regional variants of pre-existing Dravida (South Indian) temples, defined the Karnataka Dravida tradition.|$|E
25|$|Except in winter, {{the uniform}} for {{students}} from grades six to twelve {{consists of a}} short-sleeved white shirt with white trousers. For students from grades three to five, the uniform is a short-sleeved white shirt with navy blue half pants. The uniform differs a bit during the winter season. In winter, students wear a navy blue sweater with a necktie, in addition to shirt and pants. For footwear, students wear black Oxford shoes with white socks. In addition, a name tag and college badge are included {{as part of the}} uniform. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> color badge on the sleeve which indicates the house to which the student is attached to. Sport uniforms include white T-shirts with navy blue half pants and appropriate footwear. Resident students have distinctive uniforms as well.|$|E
25|$|While life on Earth is {{regarded}} to have spawned relatively {{early in the}} planet's history, the evolution from multicellular to intelligent organisms took around 800 million years. Civilizations on Earth have existed for about 12,000 years and radio communication reaching space has existed for less than 100 years. Relative {{to the age of}} the Solar System (~4.57 Ga) this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> age span, an age span in which extreme climatic variations, super volcanoes or large meteorite impacts were absent. These events would severely harm intelligent life, as well as life in general. For example, the Permian-Triassic mass extinction, caused by widespread and continuous volcanic eruptions in {{an area the size of}} Western Europe, led to the extinction of 95% of known species around 251.2 Ma ago. About 65 million years ago, the Chicxulub impact at the Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary (~65.5 Ma) on the Yucatán peninsula in Mexico led to a mass extinction of the most advanced species at that time.|$|E

25|$|A man (McKinney) named Darill (pronounced da-RILL), {{who never}} quite understands {{what is going}} on, but always tries to affect an air of sophistication. Darill's strange mix of sunny good will, idiocy and pretense annoys {{everyone}} he meets, although he is rarely aware of it. Famous Darill sketches involve him hosting a painting show on television, and joining the Big Brother program and mentoring an unreceptive boy. The background for Darill's strange behavior is explained somewhat in one sketch, in which we see a flashback of Darill {{as a child in}} Belgium, and the strange rapport he enjoys with his mother (whom he still lives with, much to the confusion of the date he has brought back to his apartment). One sketch also reveals that the only thing he ever daydreams about <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> oom-pah band playing on a windowsill, and is astonished when he discovers others don't have that limitation. After the end of The Kids in the Hall television show, Mark McKinney became a Saturday Night Live cast member, and brought Darill onto that show.|$|E

[...] The menu is short and constantly changing. [...] Writing for the Chicago Sun Times, Allecia Vemillion calls dinner at Schwa [...] "a window into Carlson's own brain – laser-focused on food with little time for anything else."

500|$|The whiskery shark has a {{moderately}} stout build, {{with an almost}} [...] "humpbacked" [...] appearance. The short snout is rounded or wedge-shaped when viewed from above. This species is the only houndshark in which the flaps of skin preceding the nostrils are elongated into thin barbels. The horizontally oval eyes are placed high {{on the head and}} are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). Beneath the eye is a prominent ridge, and behind it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>tiny</b> spiracle. The mouth forms a short, wide arch, and bears somewhat long furrows at the corners. Tooth rows number 24–32 in the upper and 36–42 in the lower jaw. Each upper tooth has an angled, knife-like main cusp with smaller cusplets on the trailing side, while each lower tooth has a single upright cusp. Five pairs of gill slits are seen.|$|E
