2500|$|Years later, Crystal {{appeared}} on Inside the Actors Studio and fondly recalled that, after the Oscar ceremony, Palance approached {{him during the}} reception: [...] "He stopped me and put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> and went, 'Billy Crystal, who {{thought it would be}} you?' It was his really funny way of saying thank you to a little New York Jewy guy who got him the Oscars." ...|$|E
2500|$|During a 1995 Ryder Cup match, Tom Lehman was {{critical}} of Faldo for not clearly telling him to pick his ball up {{when it was a}} foot away from the hole. Lehman said: [...] "Faldo mumbled something, then made a gesture to me." [...] This angered the American who said: [...] "I told him to speak clearly. He stretched <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> as if to say, 'Put the ball in your pocket, you idiot.' [...] " ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 20, 2010 Hamilton {{was arrested}} in Cleveland, Ohio after assaulting an officer. On February 11, 2011 Hamilton would post bail for $25,000 and was {{referred}} for psychiatric treatment. On March 6, 2015 during an interview Hamilton would go more into detail {{about what happened in}} that situation stating [...] "I knew better than to punch a cop" [...] Hamilton had just crashed his father's girlfriend's car, which he took without permission or a drivers license. Unharmed, he wandered to Quicken Loans Arena where he began playing what he says was an imaginary basketball with exiting Cavalier fans. [...] "This cop walks over and was like, what are you doing?. I said, Basketball. He puts <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> to guard me, so I crossed him and he slipped. His partner came over like, What's going on? He grabbed my arm and I punched him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Pro and his {{brothers}} were visited by Generals Roberto Cruz and Palomera Lopez around 11 p.m. on November 22, 1927. [...] The next day, as Pro walked from his cell to the courtyard and the firing squad, he blessed the soldiers, knelt, and briefly prayed quietly. Declining a blindfold, he faced his executioners with a crucifix {{in one hand and}} a rosary in the other and held <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> in imitation of the crucified Christ and shouted out, [...] "May God have mercy on you! May God bless you! Lord, Thou knowest that I am innocent! With all my heart I forgive my enemies!" [...] Before the firing squad were ordered to shoot, Pro raised his arms in imitation of Christ and shouted the defiant cry of the Cristeros, [...] "Viva Cristo Rey!" [...] – [...] "Long live Christ the King!". When the initial shots of the firing squad failed to kill him, a soldier shot him at point-blank range.|$|E
2500|$|After the race, Magnussen {{was treated}} for {{dehydration}} and minor burns on his lower back by his trainer Antti Vierula with an iced towel and McLaren sought a doctor who gave attention to Magnussen in the team's hospitality building. His condition {{was caused by a}} broken radiator seal which possibly came loose after going over the turn seven kerbing early in the Grand Prix, causing hot air to be directed into his cockpit, making his seat and drinks bottle warmer. He found the drinks bottle content very hot to consume and complained over the radio that it burned his mouth. Magnussen raised <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> of his cockpit to direct cool air down his sleeves and onto his back to alleviate the pain. The driver called his tenth-place finish [...] "the hardest-earnt point I've ever had" [...] and the McLaren team principal Éric Boullier said his performance under the circumstances was a [...] "scant consolidation" [...] and reserved praise for Magnussen being [...] "indicative of his tremendous fighting spirit". Magnussen later posted on Twitter that reports of his conditions were exaggerated and that he felt [...] "just hot and sweaty," [...] Kvyat also suffered from dehydration when his water supply malfunctioned after two-thirds race distance.|$|E
2500|$|On January 26, 2011 (Australia Day), Buffett was {{performing}} {{a concert in}} Australia at Sydney's Hordern Pavilion and fell off the stage after an encore. A concert-goer said, [...] "He just {{went over to the}} edge of the stage, like he had numerous times through the night, just to wave, and people were throwing stuffed toys and things at him. And he just took one step too many and just disappeared in a flash. He didn't have time to put <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>out</b> to save himself or anything, he just dropped." [...] Coincidentally, one of Australia's leading trauma surgeons was at the concert and close to the stage; Dr. Gordian Fulde treated Buffett at the scene. Fulde said, [...] "I thought he'd broken his neck.... I heard the clunk of his head on a metal ledge, he has a deep gash on his scalp, which is all right now.... But at first I thought: this guy is going to be a spinal injury." [...] Dr Fulde turned him on his side so he could breathe and administered first aid. Buffett regained consciousness within a few minutes. He was then transported to St Vincent's Hospital Emergency centre for treatment and was released the next day. Buffett returned to Australia in 2012 for two shows in Brisbane and Melbourne, and made much fun of the incident during those shows. In the Melbourne show in the historic Palais Theatre in the Melbourne beachside suburb of St. Kilda he presented additional verses of [...] "Margaritaville" [...] in which he made humorous references to the accident, much to the audience's delight.|$|E
