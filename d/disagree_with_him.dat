5|$|In {{the medieval}} and renaissance tradition, Troilus {{is one of}} those who argue most for war against the Greeks in Priam's council. In several texts, for example the Laud Troy Book, he says that those who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> are better suited to be priests. Guido, and writers who follow him, have Hector, knowing how headstrong his brother can be, counsel Troilus not to be {{reckless}} before the first battle.|$|E
25|$|According to al-Kindi, {{the goal}} of metaphysics is the {{knowledge}} of God. For this reason, he {{does not make a}} clear distinction between philosophy and theology, because he believes they are both concerned with the same subject. Later philosophers, particularly al-Farabi and Avicenna, would strongly <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on this issue, by saying that metaphysics is actually concerned with being qua being, and as such, the nature of God is purely incidental.|$|E
25|$|Mattioli held a {{post in the}} Imperial Court as {{physician}} to Ferdinand II, Archduke of Austria, and the Emperor Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor. This position granted him an immense influence. He frequently tested the effects of poisonous plants on prisoners in order to popularize his works. He also affirmed that Jean Ruel had declared some information in the licopsis chapter of his Materia Medica. This is false, but still Mattioli {{used it as a}} reason for attacking Ruel. He did not tolerate either rivals nor corrections. The naturalists and physicians daring to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> or who had corrected him, were attacked. The list of important characters that were admonished, rebuked, or pursued by the Inquisition contains Wieland, Anguillara, Gesner, Lusitanus and others. This made editions of Matioli's De Materia Medica omnipresent throughout the continent, especially in northern Europe.|$|E

500|$|The {{publication}} of this essay, {{the title of}} which Esolen claimed he did not choose, was greeted with anger on the Providence campus from students and faculty alike. Providence students organized a protest march. A group of faculty members of the school wrote a petition in which they charged that Esolen's writings contained repeated [...] "racist, xenophobic, misogynist, homophobic and religiously chauvinist statements." [...] The Rev. Brian Shanley, O.P., President of Providence College, publicly distanced himself from Esolen's statements by claiming [...] "that he speaks only for himself." [...] Meanwhile, Robert P. George, a conservative Catholic professor at Esolen's alma mater, Princeton University, defended him. He argued that students and faculty members who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> [...] "should respond in the currency of academic discourse—reasons, evidence, arguments—not by attempting to isolate, stigmatize, and marginalize him for stating dissenting opinions." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's {{name is a}} play of {{the title}} of the NBC sitcom, I Dream of Jeannie. The scene in which Stewie and Brian destroy the record is nearly {{identical}} to a scene in the movie Office Space in which the characters destroy a printer, including use of the same song. Peter makes Jesus admit that he is the messiah by threatening to urinate over albums of Christian artist Amy Grant. Peter attempts to top Jesus' story about his crucifixion during a dinner conversation with a story about how he and his friends [...] "got wrecked on Southern Comfort" [...] before going to see The Chronicles of Riddick. George W. Bush explains to the American people that going to war was correct because he answers to Jesus Christ, then Peter and Jesus interrupt him to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him,</b> similar to a scene in Woody Allen's Annie Hall. Jesus is invited to the Tonight Show, hosted by Jay Leno.|$|E

He generally gives the impression of being unbiased and nonpartisan, and when offering his own opinion identifies it as such.

2500|$|Chesterton is {{well known}} for his fictional priest-detective Father Brown, and for his {{reasoned}} apologetics. Even some of those who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> have recognised the wide appeal of such works as Orthodoxy and The Everlasting Man. [...] Chesterton routinely referred to himself as an [...] "orthodox" [...] Christian, and came to identify this position more and more with Catholicism, eventually converting to Catholicism from High Church Anglicanism. George Bernard Shaw, his [...] "friendly enemy", said of him, [...] "He was a man of colossal genius." [...] Biographers have identified him as a successor to such Victorian authors as Matthew Arnold, Thomas Carlyle, Cardinal John Henry Newman, and John Ruskin.|$|E

2500|$|Despite {{having been}} raised Jewish, Chomsky is {{currently}} non-religious, {{although he has}} expressed approval of forms of religion such as liberation theology. He {{is known for his}} [...] "dry, laconic wit", and for the use of irony in his writings, and has attracted controversy for labeling established political and academic figures with terms like [...] "corrupt", [...] "fascist", and [...] "fraudulent". Chomsky's colleague Steven Pinker has said that he [...] "portrays people who <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> as stupid or evil, using withering scorn in his rhetoric", and that this contributes to the extreme reactions that he generates from his critics. Chomsky avoids attending academic conferences, including left-oriented ones such as the Socialist Scholars Conference, preferring to speak to activist groups or hold university seminars for mass audiences.|$|E

He doesn't have horns. We may <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> on some issues and we may wish that you know, the unemployment rate was coming down faster and we want him to know his plan on gas prices.

[...] During his long run as a commentator, his segments earned both Emmy and Peabody Awards. In 1987, he was honored as an inductee to the Academy's Fourth Hall of Fame. Those who disagreed with his views nicknamed him [...] "Eric Severalsides." [...] Sevareid recognized his own biases, which caused some to <b>disagree</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> vehemently.
