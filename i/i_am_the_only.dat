500|$|The {{relationship}} between Maria Theresa and Joseph {{was not without}} warmth but was complicated and their personalities clashed. Despite his intellect, Maria Theresa's force of personality often made Joseph cower. Sometimes, she openly admired his talents and achievements, but criticised him behind his back. She wrote: [...] "We never see each other except at dinner ... His temper gets worse every day ... Please burn this letter ... I just try to avoid public scandal." [...] In another letter, also addressed to Joseph's companion, she complained: [...] "He avoids me ... <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person in his way and so I am an obstruction and a burden ...

The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF. Speaking with Dennis Goodwin of the First World War Veterans' Association, Allingham said, [...] "It is a shock as well as a privilege to think that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man alive from that original reorganisation when the RAF was formed." ...|$|E
500|$|At first, Angelou {{intended}} {{to return to}} poetry and play-writing after completing Caged Bird and write no more autobiographies, but she chose the genre as her primary mode of expression because of its challenge and {{so that she could}} [...] "change it, to make it bigger, richer, finer, and more inclusive in the twentieth century". In a 1989 interview, she stated, [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> serious writer who has chosen the autobiographical form to carry my work, my expression". [...] As she told journalist George Plimpton during a 1990 interview, [...] "Autobiography is awfully seductive; it’s wonderful". [...] She also told Plimpton that like the tradition begun by Frederick Douglass in slave narratives, she used the literary technique of [...] "speaking in the first-person singular talking about the first-person plural, always saying I meaning 'we'". [...] As critic Susan Gilbert states, Angelou was reporting not one person's story, but the collective's. [...] Scholar Selwyn R. Cudjoe agrees, and sees Angelou as representative of the convention in African-American autobiography as a public gesture that speaks for an entire group of people.|$|E

2500|$|Dee's Speculum or Mirror (an {{obsidian}} Aztec cult {{object in}} the shape of a hand-mirror, brought to Europe in the late 1520s), which was subsequently owned by Horace Walpole. Jennifer Rampling has claimed that Dee never actually owned this object. The item now residing in the British Museum was first attributed to Dee by Horace Walpole. Lord Frederick Campbell had brought [...] "a round piece of shining black marble in a leathern case" [...] to Walpole in an attempt to ascertain the object's provenance. According to Walpole, he responded saying [...] "Oh, Lord, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man in England that can tell you! It is Dr. Dee's black stone". There is no explicit reference to the mirror in any of Dee's surviving writings. The provenance of the Museum's obsidian speculum, as well as the crystal ball, is in fact dubious.|$|E
2500|$|The {{accession}} of Elizabeth to {{the throne}} brought up {{the question of the}} name of the royal house. The Duke's uncle, Louis Mountbatten, 1st Earl Mountbatten of Burma, advocated the name House of Mountbatten, as Elizabeth would typically have taken Philip's last name on marriage; however, when Queen Mary, Elizabeth's grandmother, heard of this suggestion, she informed the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who himself later advised the Queen to issue a royal proclamation declaring that the royal house was to remain known as the House of Windsor. Churchill's strong personal antipathy to Lord Mountbatten, whom he considered a dangerous and subversive rival who had lost India, may have contributed to this. Prince Philip privately complained, [...] "I am nothing but a bloody amoeba. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> man in the country not allowed to give his name to his own children." ...|$|E

Called a [...] "harrowingly pretentious verse drama" [...] by Time, the production went through a troubled out-of-town tryout period in Boston and closed after five performances on Broadway in February 1960. Heston, a great admirer of Olivier the actor, took on the play {{to work with him}} as a director. After the play flopped, Heston told columnist Joe Hyams, [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one who came out with a profit.... I got out of it precisely what I went in for – a chance to work with Olivier. I learned from him in six weeks things I never would have learned otherwise.

His earliest known recording success was in 1896 with [...] "In the World Turned Upside Down", followed by [...] "Down Fell the Pony in a Fit" [...] in 1897. In 1898 Champion ceased his style of alternating songs and patter and instead adopted a quick fire delivery in order for him to perform as many songs as he could during his act. He retained this style of delivery for the remainder of his career, remarking, [...] "At one time I used to sing songs with plenty of patter but I changed the style for a new idea of my own, and started [...] "quick singing". I think <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> comedian who sings songs all in a lump, as you may say".|$|E
