25|$|A {{few years}} ago there were many {{children}} and men who turned out immediately after a snow-fall, and were daily to be met during the thaw, brushing the crossings as clean as they could. For this small service many foot passengers gladly gave a few small coins, regarding the sweepers not as beggars or vagrants, but as laborers, whose hard and disagreeable work enabled well-shod people to pass neatly on their way. There has, however, been a prohibition of street sweepers...The result is that on Wednesday last...there was not one crossing on which they snow and mud did not come full two inches above the sole of a thick <b>gaiter,</b> and it was entirely impossible to find a single crossing {{to the opposite side}} of the avenue which could be trod without sinking to the ankle...let us have the volunteer sweepers back for the comfort of a LADY PEDESTRIAN.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Gaiters</b> are {{garments}} worn {{over the}} shoe and lower [...] pants leg, and used primarily as personal protective equipment; similar garments used primarily for display are [...] spats.Originally, <b>gaiters</b> {{were made of}} leather.

50|$|<b>Gaiters</b> are {{a type of}} {{protective}} clothing for a person's ankles and legs below the knee. <b>Gaiters</b> are worn when walking, hiking, running (especially orienteering and rogaining) outdoors amongst dense underbrush or in snow, with or without snowshoes. Heavy <b>gaiters</b> are often worn when using crampons, to protect the leg and ankle from the spikes of the opposite foot. <b>Gaiters</b> strap over the hiking boot and around the person's leg to provide protection from branches and thorns and to prevent mud, snow, etc. from entering {{the top of the}} boot. <b>Gaiters</b> may also be worn as protection against snake bites.|$|R

2500|$|On 5 September 1776, the Marine Committee apportioned {{a uniform}} for the Continental Marines. [...] The uniform {{regulations}} specified that standard uniform {{was a short}} green coat with white trim facings (lapels, cuffs, and coat lining), and a high leather collar to protect against cutlass slashes and to keep a man's head erect, leading to the nickname [...] "leatherneck"; complemented by a white waistcoat, white or buff short breeches, woolen stockings, and a short black <b>gaiter.</b> [...] Marine officers wore small cocked hats, and a single epaulette; and the enlisted men sported round black hats with the brim pinned on one side. [...] The adoption of green coats and round hats probably reflects the constraints of availability, for both of the uniform attire were used by the Philadelphia Associators. [...] It wasn't until the year 1777 that the Marines entirely appeared in uniform in numbers. Though legend attributes the green color to the traditional color of riflemen, Continental Marines mostly carried muskets. More likely, green cloth was simply plentiful in Philadelphia, and it served to distinguish Marines from {{the blue of the}} Army and Navy or the red of the British. Also, Sam Nicholas's hunting club wore green uniforms, hence his recommendation was for green. Notably, Marines aboard [...] wore red, though they were mostly Irish soldiers of the French Army.|$|E

The only bit of bright colour about him was a scarlet belt round his waist, {{from the side of}} which depended a long knife in a brown leather sheath. A pair of light shoes and a small round cap, resembling what is styled in these days a pork-pie, completed his costume. He was about forty years of age.|$|E

60|$|This {{picture of}} to-day in its frame of {{four hundred years}} ago did not produce that marked {{contrast}} between ancient and modern which is implied by the contrast of date.

In London, twenty or thirty-years ago are old times; in Paris ten years, or five; in Weatherbury three or four score years {{were included in the}} mere present, and nothing less than a century set a mark on its face or tone. Five decades hardly modified the cut of a <b>gaiter,</b> the embroidery of a smock-frock, by the breadth of a hair. Ten generations failed to alter the turn of a single phrase. In these Wessex nooks the busy outsider's ancient times are only old; his old times are still new; his present is futurity.|$|E

[...] "If {{we intend to}} go on we must hasten; permit me, my dear madam," [...] and before she could reply he had lifted the astounded matron in his arms, and made gallantly for the ford. The gentle Maria cast an ominous eye on her brother, who, with {{manifest}} reluctance, performed for her the same office. But that acute young lady kept her eyes upon the preceding figure of the elder gentleman, and seeing him suddenly and mysteriously disappear to his armpits, unhesitatingly threw herself from her brother's protecting arms,--an action which instantly precipitated him into the water,--and paddled hastily to the opposite bank, where she eventually assisted in pulling the elderly gentleman out of the hollow into which he had fallen, and in rescuing her mother, who floated helplessly on the surface, upheld by her skirts, like a gigantic and variegated water-lily. Dick followed with a single <b>gaiter.</b> In another minute they were safe on the opposite bank.|$|E
60|$|Massena was a thin, sour little fellow, {{and after}} his hunting {{accident}} he had only one eye, but when it looked {{out from under his}} cocked hat there was not much upon a field of battle which escaped it. He could stand in front of a battalion, and with a single sweep tell you if a buckle or a <b>gaiter</b> button were out of place. Neither the officers nor the men were very fond of him, for he was, as you know, a miser, and soldiers love that their leaders should be free-handed. At the same time, when it came to work they had a very high respect for him, and they would rather fight under him than under anyone except the Emperor himself, and Lannes, when he was alive. After all, if he had a tight grasp upon his money-bags, there was a day also, you must remember, when that same grip was upon Zurich and Genoa. He clutched on to his positions as he did to his strong box, and it took a very clever man to loosen him from either.|$|E
60|$|I {{happened}} {{to pass along}} the line on some duty or other when I noticed my younger brother, whose keen desire to take some part in the public quarrel had led me, in spite of misgivings, to procure him a lieutenancy, lying on the ground, with his troop. As I approached I saw him start in the quick, peculiar manner of a stricken man. I asked him at once whether he was hurt, and he said something--he thought {{it must be a}} bullet--had hit him on the <b>gaiter</b> and numbed his leg. He was quite sure it had not gone in, but when we had carried him away we found--as I expected--that he was shot through the leg. The wound was not serious, but the doctors declared he would be a month in hospital. It was his baptism of fire, and I have since wondered at the strange caprice which strikes down one man in his first skirmish and protects another time after time. But I suppose all pitchers will get broken in the end. Outwardly I sympathised with my brother in his misfortune, which he mourned bitterly, since it prevented him taking part in the impending battle, but secretly I confess myself well content that this young gentleman should be honourably out of harm's way for a month.|$|E

60|$|Indulging our fancy in this freak, we have partly {{lost the}} power of {{restraint}} and guidance. We distinguish an unlooked-for figure in our visionary scene. Among those ancestral people there is a young man, dressed in the very fashion of to-day: he wears a dark frock-coat, almost destitute of skirts, gray pantaloons, <b>gaiter</b> boots of patent leather, and has a finely wrought gold chain across his breast, and a little silver-headed whalebone stick in his hand. Were we to meet this figure at noonday, we should greet him as young Jaffrey Pyncheon, the Judge's only surviving child, who has been spending {{the last two years}} in foreign travel. If still in life, how comes his shadow hither? If dead, what a misfortune! The old Pyncheon property, together with the great estate acquired by the young man's father, would devolve on whom? On poor, foolish Clifford, gaunt Hepzibah, and rustic little Phoebe! But another and a greater marvel greets us! Can we believe our eyes? A stout, elderly gentleman has made his appearance; he has an aspect of eminent respectability, wears a black coat and pantaloons, of roomy width, and might be pronounced scrupulously neat in his attire, but for a broad crimson stain across his snowy neckcloth and down his shirt-bosom. Is it the Judge, or no? How can it be Judge Pyncheon? We discern his figure, as plainly as the flickering moonbeams can show us anything, still seated in the oaken chair! Be the apparition whose it may, it advances to the picture, seems to seize the frame, tries to peep behind it, and turns away, with a frown as black as the ancestral one.|$|E
