5|$|In 2002, Harvey {{called for}} Mark and Steve Waugh {{to be dropped}} from the Australian team, {{claiming}} {{that they were a}} waste of space. He stated: Money {{is the only thing that}} keeps them playing...If they earned the same money as I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> playing they'd have retired at 34 as I did, and Australian cricket would be the better for it.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 March 2015, {{a formal}} {{announcement}} was made, confirming the project, with Ullman {{saying that it}} was a 'privilege to be doing this,' and [...] "I still feel as inspired to inhabit people as I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> six, standing on the windowsill in my mother's bedroom, putting on a show." [...] Shane Allen, controller of comedy commissioning added: [...] "It's about time the Americans gave her back. Tracey has been the missing gem in the British comedy crown for too long. Talent doesn't come much bigger and the BBC audience is in for a huge treat." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We Found Love" [...] premiered in the United Kingdom on September 22, 2011, on Capital FM, and {{was sent}} for {{mainstream}} adds in the United States on October 11, 2011. The song was released via iTunes on September 22, 2011. During an interview with MTV News, Calvin Harris revealed, [...] "'We Found Love,' is the most successful thing I've done ever... It's not strictly a song by me, obviously, it's by Rihanna. She sings it...It was great to work with her... No one could have taken {{it as far as}} she did. You can't escape it here [...] I've heard it a lot. I've heard it probably more times today than I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mixing it. Which is a good thing... Ever since the Rihanna song did well, {{a lot of people want}} to do some stuff, which is great... That's what I enjoy doing. In terms of actual names, I've not done anything yet." [...] In October 2012, British singer Leona Lewis claimed that she was originally chosen to sing the song but ended up losing it to Rihanna when Harris went touring with the latter, commenting. [...] "I didn’t commit to it because I wanted [...] "Trouble" [...] to be my first single so I think that was another reason they went with Rihanna. It was the same version and production but mine’s better." [...] In 2013, Nicole Scherzinger claimed that she was the first artist given the song but ended up rejecting it, commenting. [...] "I've got the demo of that song and I was busy at the time. They'd sent me a few dance tracks and I wasn't able to get to them and I was like, 'Oh there's so much dance and I want to take a break from it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I shall {{wait here}} awhile till I see the Master made a king among {{these people and}} {{established}} in his rule. Then I shall start on that journey alone, hoping that what <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> mad <b>I</b> shall <b>be</b> able to <b>do</b> again <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not mad." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Frank, {{the first}} {{question}} of all is--How is my mother? What <b>did</b> she <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> missing? It must have been awful for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gilbert, my lord, is homeward bound, [...] His sloop {{is drawing}} near, What shall <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> found [...] Not {{in his house}} but here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Softly, mother, softly! Treat me as you <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> so big," [...] he exclaimed, {{indicating}} {{about one}} foot six between his hands.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes. I find it {{necessary}} to tell almost as many lies now that I am a simple laborer as I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a gentleman. More, in fact." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be careful," [...] pleaded Dave. [...] "I love {{to watch}} a storm--I always <b>did,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on the farm. I never thought of hiding, {{no matter how hard}} it thundered or lightened." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'So this <b>is</b> {{what you}} <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{out in the}} fields! Ah! {{it is no wonder}} if the farm is ruined. Are you not ashamed, girl, to behave so?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is God's will, {{and we must}} bow to His judgment," [...] {{continued}} the injured man. [...] "But I {{want to talk to}} you about what to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> gone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I thought {{everybody}} did live in {{a castle}} in Ireland," [...] said Mr. Monk. [...] "They seemed to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> there twenty years ago. But for myself, I prefer a cottage." ...|$|R
60|$|CAPTAIN SHOTOVER. No. I am ageing fast. My mind {{does not}} dwell on {{slaughter}} as it <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy. Why doesn't your husband invent something? He does nothing but tell lies to women.|$|E
6000|$|... "I never <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy, but--well--I {{did have}} a couple of fights when I was on the cattle-boat and in England. Neither of them {{amounted}} to very much, though, I guess. I was scared stiff!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is curious, for I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{half asleep}} fancy that I heard {{something}} of the sort. I waited quite a time, {{but there was no}} more of it, so I concluded that it was all a dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'If {{such things}} had <b>been</b> <b>done</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a young girl,' said Mrs Wititterly (this, by the way, {{must have been}} some little time before), 'I don't suppose anybody would have {{believed}} it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'How {{can that}} <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{detained}} also?' said Mr Tigg; 'and when moreover, {{owing to the}} astounding, and I must add, guilty negligence of my friend Pecksniff, I have no money for coach-hire?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I can't {{say that}} I did. I looked up, as a sailor always <b>does,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on deck this morning, {{but it was}} clear enough then, and I have not noticed it {{particularly}} since." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now then, pile in, and we'll {{be getting}} to the Lodge," [...] cried Gif. [...] "I can tell you fellows I am mighty anxious to see the old place, {{to see if it}} looks like it <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here last." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May {{you never}} {{lose sight of}} God, Mr. Dishart," [...] {{the old man said}} in the parlour. Then he added, as if he had asked too much, [...] "May you never turn from Him as I often <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a lad like you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Crosbie," [...] he said, as {{he entered}} the room cheerily, [...] "I congratulate you with all my heart. I do, indeed. You have got the step early in life, and you deserve it thoroughly;--much better than I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{appointed}} to the same office." ...|$|E
60|$|CRAVEN. There I flatly {{contradict}} you {{and stand}} up for Jo. I'd no more have behaved as you <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a young man than I'd have cheated at cards. I belong to the Old Order.|$|R
6000|$|... "So it does, sir--so it <b>does.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{second mate}} of a Sunderland barque, in forty-one, in the Mediterranean, I could pay out their lingo {{as easy as}} you would a five-inch warp over a ship's side--" ...|$|R
60|$|SHE. There! The moment I {{begin to}} object, you get angry. What will you <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only your property--stolen property? It can't be, Guy. It can't <b>be!</b> <b>I</b> thought it could, but it can't. You'll {{get tired of}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "The old {{garrison}} don't look as it <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> here in 188-," [...] he said, musingly. [...] "Army {{days in the}} West {{are almost}} gone. The Indian war is over. What a waste of human life it was on both sides! Yes, Louie, go ahead." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{went out}} a hundred, mother, {{and we came}} home forty-four--if we are at home. Is it a dream, mother? Is this you? and this old Bridgeland Street again? As I live, there stands Evans the smith, at his door, tankard in hand, as he <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a boy!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not in the least,' said he. 'You {{will feel}} a trifling {{inconvenience}} for a month, just as I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> first {{brought to this}} vile hamlet; then your admirable sense and temper will prevail, and I see you already as content as ever, and making your husband the happiest of men.' ...|$|E
60|$|Sara didn't scold or coax any more. She {{patted my}} head and kissed me and made me bathe my face and go to bed. Then she tucked me in just as she used to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little girl.|$|R
6000|$|... "Simple things," [...] complained Jessie to her mother, [...] "that <b>I</b> used to <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{no bigger}} than Essie, and yet she is always teasing one about how and why! She wanted me to tell why I carried one." ...|$|R
60|$|She. There! The moment I {{begin to}} object, you get angry. What will you <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> only your {{property}} stolen property? It can't be, Guy. It can't <b>be!</b> <b>I</b> thought it could, but it can't. You'll {{get tired of}} me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I work," [...] he admitted, [...] "but I {{sometimes}} {{ask myself}} whether I {{work with the}} same motives as I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young. I started life as an altruist. I am not sure now whether I am not working in self-defence, from habit, because I am afraid of falling behind." ...|$|E
60|$|SIR HOWARD. No. This man may be ignorant {{enough to}} suppose that when I was a {{struggling}} barrister I could do everything I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> Attorney General. You know better. There is some excuse for his mother. She was an uneducated Brazilian, knowing nothing of English society, and driven mad by injustice.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not in the least," [...] said he. [...] "You {{will feel}} a trifling {{inconvenience}} for a month, just as I <b>did</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> first {{brought to this}} vile hamlet; then your admirable sense and temper will prevail, and I see you already as content as ever, and making your husband the happiest of men." ...|$|E
2500|$|Not {{only did}} he remove {{all the trappings of}} his bourgeois {{heritage}} from his studio, but he also set about destroying practically all of his own early work, which he described as [...] "Childish baubles, <b>done</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a dirty bourgeois".|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw it <b>done</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{second mate}} on a lime-juicer," [...] Captain Ward spoke up. [...] "The old man used a {{caulking}} mallet and a steel marlin-spike. He took the tooth {{out with the}} first stroke, too, clean as a whistle." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will take}} their outfit upon myself, Francis," [...] the earl said. [...] "My steward shall {{go out with}} them and see to it. It <b>is</b> the least <b>I</b> can <b>do</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> abetting you in depriving my old tutor of his sons." ...|$|R
