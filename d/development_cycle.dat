Igarashi commented the two player game play was homage to , his favorite Castlevania game. The anime style of artwork was retained from Dawn of Sorrow, which Igarashi had switched to in the previous title to appeal more to the younger demographics of the Nintendo handheld systems.

In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan.

5|$|Final Fantasy XV (originally {{known as}} Final Fantasy Versus XIII), the fifteenth core Final Fantasy title {{and the third}} main title in the subseries, was {{announced}} {{in the same year}} as XIII and Type-0, and was released worldwide on November 29, 2016. The game is an action role-playing game with a battle system similar to those from the Kingdom Hearts series and Type-0. The game uses open world exploration using both a vehicle and chocobos, along with a camping mechanic linked to gaining experience levels. Its <b>development</b> <b>cycle,</b> beginning in 2006, lasted ten years.|$|E

5|$|The game centres around Donkey Kong and {{his nephew}} Diddy Kong, who must recover their stolen hoard of bananas from King K. Rool and the Kremlings. Development {{of the game}} first began shortly after Rare's Tim and Chris Stamper ran {{experiments}} with a Silicon Graphics workstation, rendering realistic 3D sprites. Nintendo became interested in Rare's work and soon acquired 49% of the company which culminated {{in the production of}} a new title using Alias and SGI technology for the SNES console. The Stamper brothers expressed an interest to create a standalone Donkey Kong game, and assembled a team of 12 to work on the game over an 18-month <b>development</b> <b>cycle.</b>|$|E
5|$|Adventure was {{published}} by the developer of the 2600 console, Atari, Inc, and programmed by Atari employee Warren Robinett. At the time, Atari programmers were generally given full control on the creative direction and <b>development</b> <b>cycle</b> for their games, but this required them to plan for their next game as they neared completion of their current one to stay productive. Robinett was finishing his work on Slot Racers when he was {{given an opportunity to}} visit the Stanford Artificial Intelligence Laboratory by Julius Smith, one of several friends he was sharing a house with. There, he was introduced to the 1977 version of the computer text game Colossal Cave Adventure, created by Will Crowther and modified by Don Woods. After playing the game for several hours, he was inspired to create a graphical version of the game.|$|E

5|$|After {{the release}} of Escape from Butcher Bay, Starbreeze again {{encountered}} financial difficulties after having not received a significant royalty payment from Vivendi. It sold part of its motion capture and animation department to a British company, Centroid. However, the game helped set Starbreeze's reputation as a studio capable of making good licensed titles. With the help of Union Entertainment, an intermediary company, Starbreeze {{signed an agreement with}} Majesco Entertainment for a new title set within The Darkness universe owned by Top Cow Comics on July 16, 2004. Midway through the game's development, Majesco underwent restructuring because of financial difficulties, shifted its focus, and dropped the game. 2K Games stepped up and acquired the publishing rights. 2K extended the game's <b>development</b> <b>cycle,</b> and asked Starbreeze to develop a multiplayer mode for the game. The Darkness was released in 2007. It fared worse than the team expected critically, but its commercial performance was satisfactory, selling more than 1 million copies worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Continuing the {{tradition}} {{set by the}} first game, Wipeout 3 contains electronica offerings from various artists, including The Chemical Brothers, Orbital, and the Propellerheads. Psygnosis' development manager, Enda Carey, focused on bringing together music early in the game's <b>development</b> <b>cycle,</b> instead of as an afterthought or last-minute addition to the game. Unlike previous soundtracks, Psygnosis selected a single music director, DJ Sasha, who worked with artists to create a cohesive soundtrack. Sasha included several of his own tracks made specifically for the game. The game disc is a Mixed Mode CD that allows Wipeout 3s soundtrack to be played in a standard compact disc player. To promote Wipeout 3 and its game music, Psygnosis sponsored a Global Underground tour for Sasha. Game pods featuring Wipeout 3 were placed at parties and venues, accompanied by a tie-in marketing campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the release}} of Operation Flashpoint: Cold War Crisis, the team {{intended}} to continue updating the game with post-release content, develop a port for the Xbox console, and create a sequel. Projected to take only nine months to develop, the Xbox version also known as , was released in 2005, {{four years after the}} game's initial release. The reason for the long <b>development</b> <b>cycle</b> stemmed from the team's unfamiliarity with the console's structure. With {{the release of}} a new generation of hardware including a new Xbox console, Elites release did not gain its audience's attention. Sales were lackluster and the development suffered a huge financial loss. In 2005 the company also founded the Independent Developers Association (IDEA) with Black Element Software and Altar Games. The organization aimed at supporting other independent game development studios with services including marketing support and negotiation with publishers.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Studies {{analyzing}} {{the impact of}} technological innovations on how an industry develops focus on the different effects produced by radical innovations versus incremental innovations. The studies either examine the technology cycles or the market <b>development</b> <b>cycles</b> in isolation without really explaining {{the interaction between the}} two. In this paper, we present a model of industry development that takes into account the dynamics of innovation in the industry accentuated by the interplay between technology <b>development</b> <b>cycles</b> and application <b>development</b> <b>cycles.</b> The model proposes that these two cycles go through a linked, predictable double helix pattern. The personal computer (PC) industry is used as an example of this model’s operation, as the PC industry has gone through three distinct technology cycles (8 -b, 16 -b, and 32 -b processors) and corresponding three distinct application cycles. We draw some important conclusions about how companies can use this understanding to develop better technology and market strategies to succeed in the various stages of the industry’s development...|$|R
5|$|Having {{received}} Nintendo 64DD development kits {{that included}} the Nintendo 64 Expansion Pak, Iguana Entertainment added an optional high-resolution mode to the game {{early on in the}} <b>development</b> <b>cycle.</b> In conjunction with the Expansion Pak, this mode allows the game to be played at a resolution of 640x480 pixels, a technical accomplishment for the Nintendo 64 at the time. An upgraded polygon modelling technique was used to give the game better-formed creatures. However, motion capture was avoided because none of game's enemies are human. Dienstbier felt that if their animations were motion captured, enemies would look like a person pretending to be a lizard in a costume. The game features different animations for different creatures. Unlike its predecessor, where enemies have two types of death animations, Seeds of Evil includes a third and gorier one.|$|E

Zero, along with its spin-off tower defense game Star Fox Guard, was released in April 2016 to mixed critical reviews. By the end of March 2016, Minami stepped down from his position as president and CEO, with executive producer Kenichi Sato succeeded him.|$|E
5|$|Kameo {{is known}} for its {{prolonged}} <b>development</b> <b>cycle,</b> which spanned four Nintendo and Microsoft consoles. It was conceived as a Pokémon-style game of capturing and nurturing monsters, but traded its lighthearted Nintendo overtones for darker themes more befitting of Xbox audiences when Microsoft acquired the developer. In this process, Kameo was repurposed from a fairy to an elf—a transition the game's director later concluded was unsuccessful. While nearly finished for the original Xbox console, the title was delayed to become an exclusive launch title for the upcoming Xbox 360. Rare used the extra time to improve the game's audiovisuals, including Rare's first orchestral soundtrack, and add a local cooperative multiplayer mode. Kameo released alongside the Xbox 360 launches: November 2005 in North America and several weeks later in Europe.|$|E
