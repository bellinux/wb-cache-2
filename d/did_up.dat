25|$|The {{technology}} {{was first used}} by Channel 4 during a Test match between England and Pakistan on Lord's Cricket Ground, on 21 May 2001. It is used primarily {{by the majority of}} television networks to track the trajectory of balls in flight. In the winter season of 2008/2009 the ICC trialled a referral system where Hawk-Eye was used for referring decisions to the third umpire if a team disagreed with an LBW decision. The third umpire was able to look at what the ball actually <b>did</b> <b>up</b> to the point when it hit the batsman, but could not look at the predicted flight of the ball after it hit the batsman.|$|E
2500|$|The RAF {{credited}} Brown with {{shooting down}} the Red Baron, {{but it is}} now generally agreed that the bullet which hit Richthofen was fired from the ground. Richthofen died following an extremely serious and inevitably fatal chest wound from a single bullet, penetrating from the right armpit and resurfacing next to the left nipple. Brown's attack was from behind and above, and from Richthofen's left. Even more conclusively, Richthofen could not have continued his pursuit of May {{for as long as}} he <b>did</b> (<b>up</b> to two minutes) had this wound come from Brown's guns. Brown himself never spoke much about what happened that day, claiming, [...] "There is no point in me commenting, as the evidence is already out there." ...|$|E
2500|$|American Catholic writer Flannery O'Connor {{illustrated}} the sacramental {{understanding of the}} world in her work [...] "Novelist and Believer":St. Augustine wrote that the things of the world pour forth from God in a double way: intellectually into the minds of the angels and physically into the world of things. To the person who believes this – as the western world <b>did</b> <b>up</b> until a few centuries ago – this physical, sensible world is good because it proceeds from a divine source ... When [...] Conrad said that his aim as an artist was to render the highest possible justice to the visible universe, he was speaking with the novelist's surest instinct. The artist penetrates the concrete world in order to find at its depths the image of its source, the image of ultimate reality.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1984, Double Trouble began {{recording}} {{their second}} studio album, Couldn't Stand the Weather, at the Power Station, with John Hammond as executive producer and engineer Richard Mullen. Layton later recalled working with Hammond: [...] "He {{was kind of}} like a nice hand on your shoulder, as opposed to someone that jumped in and said, 'Let's redo this, let's do that more.' He didn't get involved in that way at all. He was a feedback person." [...] As the sessions began, Vaughan's cover of Bob Geddins' [...] "Tin Pan Alley" [...] was recorded while audio levels were being checked. Layton remembers the performance: [...] "...we did probably the quietest version we ever <b>did</b> <b>up</b> 'til that point. We ended it and [...] said, 'That's the best that song will ever sound,' and we went, 'We haven't even got sounds, have we?' He goes, 'That doesn't matter. That's the best you'll ever do that song.' We tried it again five, six, seven times—I can't even remember. But it never quite sounded like it did that first time." ...|$|E
