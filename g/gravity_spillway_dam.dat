40|$|Although modern <b>gravity</b> <b>dam</b> <b>spillways</b> include often steep chutes {{operating}} in skimming flow regime, succession of free-falling nappes (i. e. nappe flow regime) {{are more common}} on low gradient chutes and cascades, and this flow situation received little attention to date. New experiments were conducted in nappe flows without hydraulic jump in two large-size facilities with flat slopes. The flow on the stepped cascade displayed complex, three-dimensional patterns. Detailed air-water flow measurements were performed in the jet, at nappe impact and in the downstream flow region. Key results demonstrated that the flow on each step was rapidly varied (RVF), highly three-dimensional and strongly aerated...|$|R

50|$|There is a dam {{known as}} the Humboldt Dam on Wolffs Run. The dam is an earthfill dam with a masonry core wall. The dam is 974 ft long and 41 ft high. It has a masonry <b>gravity</b> <b>spillway</b> on its right abutment.|$|R
50|$|The <b>spillway</b> for the <b>dam</b> is {{constructed}} {{on the central}} hill; it consists of a semi-circular concrete dam, which regulates {{the flow of water}} down a concrete channel built into the back slope of the hill. The <b>spillway</b> <b>dam</b> itself measures 225 m along the top; its crest is at 16 ft below the normal lake level. The spillway is designed so that water pouring over the semi-circular dam converges at the bottom from opposite directions and neutralises its own force, thus minimising erosion below.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: "Tests were {{conducted}} on a 1 : 50 -scale model of Isabella <b>Dam</b> <b>Spillway</b> to determine the adequacy of proposed <b>spillway,</b> <b>dam,</b> and channel improvements. The model reproduced {{an area of the}} reservoir 800 ft wide by 1, 100 ft long, the spillway, and {{the entire length of the}} exit channel. Unsatisfactory flow conditions were observed in the vicinity of the spillway crest due to approach conditions to the spillway. Large cross waves, present in the exit channel just downstream of the spillway, resulted in occasional overtopping of the right wall. A grouted rock dike that provided satisfactory flow conditions at the spillway and downstream throughout the exit channel was placed adjacent to the existing spillway approach wall. ...|$|R
