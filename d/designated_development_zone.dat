25|$|In 1984, the {{fourteen}} largest coastal cities were <b>designated</b> as economic <b>development</b> <b>zones,</b> including Dalian, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Guangzhou, {{all of which}} were major commercial and industrial centers.

40|$|As a novel type of {{industrial}} establishment {{in the era}} of globalization, foreign direct investment (FDI) has become a new driving force in the shaping of urban structure. To understand the current worldwide urban restructuring process, the location behaviour of FDI firms should be fully investigated. But few empirical studies on industrial location have been carried out at the intrametropolitan scale, probably {{due to the lack of}} disaggregated data and appropriate models. This study geo-references FDI firms by their postal codes and captures site attributes through cross-referencing firm distribution with other spatial coverage such as population statistics, land uses, and <b>designated</b> <b>development</b> <b>zones.</b> This paper argues for a Poisson and negative binomial model of firm location based on count-data and tests such a firm location model using the case of metropolitan Guangzhou, PRC. Results, in contrast to previous studies at the national and regional scales of this country, confirm that, at least statistically, intra-urban FDI firm location in the context of a transitional economy presents regularities that are explainable according to `rational' economic considerations of site suitability. ...|$|R
30|$|Secondly, we {{identified}} several {{cases in which}} municipalities had <b>designated</b> economic <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> where new commercial activity planned, but for which electricity grid constraints meant infrastructure costs would be prohibitive for relocating firms. In these cases, respondents were investigating {{the possibility of using}} economic development funds and innovative tax structures to subsidise smart grid solutions that would reduce the need for conventional reinforcement. This would make firm relocation far more likely and unlock land for development that was hitherto constrained by electricity distribution infrastructure.|$|R
5000|$|The {{re-engineered}} {{region was}} first <b>designated</b> a housing <b>development</b> <b>zone</b> in March 1997. A [...] "New Seoul Town Development" [...] project was announced when Goh Kun became {{the mayor of}} Seoul in July 1998. In August of the same year, the general planning for New Seoul Town project began to take form. Based on this, a master plan was established for the Millennium City (Sangam New Millennium Town). Along with drawing up a city plan to turn the Sangam region into a secondary center of Seoul, a subsequent plan was drafted to build a gateway town that embodies both information and ecology. The plan has since been carried out in concrete, and encompasses separate projects such as the World Cup Park, an environmentally friendly housing complex and the Digital Media City.|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of residential areas over {{time is a}} complex process that is characterised by substantial spatial and temporal variation. In essence, residential growth processes lead to two types of development: {{the construction of new}} housing units within existing residential areas (densification) or the {{development of}} new residential areas on land that was formerly open (expansion). This paper aims to understand the dynamic balance between these two processes and does so by analysing local changes in housing stock over time. The analysis is carried out for urban areas in the Netherlands, a country where urban concentration ambitions were adjusted in recent years. This changing planning context adds to the uncertainty about future residential development processes. Using detailed geographical data about land use and residential densities from 2000 onwards we study residential development and density changes in relation to prevailing spatially explicit policies. The observed changes are statistically linked to geographic and policy variables, such as the availability of developable land and the presence of restrictive or stimulating spatial policies. Residential densification is shown to occur in almost all regions of the country and is generally lower when demand for new dwellings is high and a limited amount of land is available within cities. Residential <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> are influential in shifting pressure from city cores while prescribing relatively high densities in expansions. At the local level we observe great variation in residential density development, but we find that densities increase within <b>designated</b> urban <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> and areas that rich in amenities. Restrictive planning regulations related to natural and landscape values tend to limit residential densities, as do initial high densities...|$|R

40|$|The {{practice}} of <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> has expanded worldwide, yet scholarship persistently disagrees {{on the role}} that <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> play in local economic development. With its focus on China, this study contributes to the discussion by exploring the effects of <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> on the economic development of host regions, using both macro-level (all national-level <b>development</b> <b>zones)</b> and meso-level (county- and district-level <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> in Guangdong Province) analyses. Our data analyses of the macro-level reveal that <b>development</b> <b>zones,</b> even though positive in developed regions, do not contribute to economic growth in proportion to their share of land in host cities on the whole. The result is confirmed by the meso-level data analysis that indicates that county- and district-level <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> in Guangdong Province, a developed region in southern China, imposed positive effects on local economies. Therefore we suggest that the Chinese central government should not expand <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> without limits, but carefully consider their location and size {{in relation to the}} host regions before approving the...|$|R

40|$|<b>Development</b> <b>zones,</b> born in {{the course}} of China’s {{economic}} transition, are the carriers of both the favorable institutions and the foreign advanced technology. They are now at the stage of transferring from the concentration of firms to being industrial clusters. Based on data of firms in <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> along the Yangtze River obtained through micro-level investigation, this paper studies the effects of local factors special to <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> as well as the influence of technology promotion on the economic performance of those firms “locating” in <b>development</b> <b>zones,</b> and thus discloses the nature of firms concentrating into <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> and their trend of transferring into industrial clusters. The empirical study suggests that firms locating on <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> mainly aim at obtaining “policy rents”, which results in that firms concentrating in <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> do not possess the industrial cluster effect in the general sense: the benefits of closing to the supply or demand market. However, although firms in a develop zone do not necessarily concentrate with related firms in space, their technology and market activities are inevitably to produce relations with factors such as local governments and related industrial elements and thus affect the economic performance of firms and nurture the clustering effects of <b>development</b> <b>zones.</b> Therefore, as “policy rents” fade away due to industry transfer and adjustment of favorable economic policies, the key to keep <b>development</b> <b>zones</b> sustainable is to enhance their clustering effects. ...|$|R

40|$|Rapid {{economic}} globalization presents major {{challenges to}} the sustainable development of ‘development zones' in many countries. <b>Development</b> <b>zones</b> in China evolved from the concept of Export Processing Zones (EPZs) in the western world.
