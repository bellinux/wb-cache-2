50|$|The most {{widespread}} salutation for informal letters is, {{by a large}} margin, dragă (equivalent to English dear). This can be used {{independently of}} the recipient's gender and is normally followed by the first name. An alternative which is less familiar is salut (equivalent to English <b>hi,</b> <b>hello),</b> followed by the first name. This version {{is typical of the}} workplace, where using dragă would be too familiar.|$|E
40|$|What’s {{the first}} {{sentence}} you would say when you greet a friend (besides <b>Hi,</b> <b>Hello</b> or Howdy) ? A couple examples come to mind: How are you? How have you been? Good Morning! Nice to see you! No doubt {{you can come up}} with a couple more that are similar in the spirit. There are of course cultural and situational differences and people may express their greetings both audibly and physically, such as handshaking, hugging, cheek kissing, or gesturing a wave or a high-five...|$|E

40|$|Deficits {{in social}} {{communication}} and interaction {{have been identified}} as distinguishing impairments for individuals with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD). As a pivotal skill, the successful development of social communication and interaction in individuals with ASD is a lifelong objective. Point-of-view video modeling has the potential to address these deficits. This type of video involves filming the completion of a targeted skill or behavior from a first-person perspective. By presenting only what a person might see from his or her viewpoint, it has been identified to be more effective in limiting irrelevant stimuli by providing a clear frame of reference to facilitate imitation. The current study investigated the use of point-of-view video modeling in teaching social initiations (e. g., greetings). Using a multiple baseline across participants design, five kindergarten participants were taught social initiations using point-of-view video modeling and video priming. Immediately before and after viewing the entire point-of-view video model, the participants were evaluated on their social initiations with a trained, typically developing peer serving as a communication partner. Specifically, the social initiations involved participants’ abilities to shift their attention toward the peer who entered the classroom, maintain attention toward the peer, and engage in an appropriate social initiation (e. g., <b>hi,</b> <b>hello).</b> Both generalization and maintenance were tested. Overall, the data suggest point-of-view video modeling is an effective intervention for increasing social initiations in young students with ASD. However, retraining was necessary for acquisition of skills in the classroom environment. Generalization in novel environments and with a novel communication partner, and generalization to other social initiation skills was limited. Additionally, maintenance of gained social initiation skills only occurred in the intervention room. Despite the limitations of the study and variable results, {{there are a number of}} implications moving forward for both practitioners and future researchers examining point-of-view modeling and its potential impact on the social initiation skills of individuals with ASD...|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the usage of}} the three greetings words <b>hi,</b> hey and <b>hello</b> incombination with greeting questions, such as how are you, and terms of address, such asBill, Mr Jones or Dad, in spoken American English. The investigation identifies someof the patterns and rules that govern greetings sequences {{and to what extent}} socialfactors like gender, age, social class and social context inform the speaker‘s choice ofgreeting. Theories within the area were then used to identify greetings in the LongmanSpoken American English Corpus that were then entered into a database along withinformation about the speakers. Using filters the greeting pairs where then sorted bydifferent factors, such as gender, to extract quantitative data on the distribution andfrequency of usage. The results showed variation influenced by social factors and formulaic patternsof greeting sequences. The study concludes that hi is the standard and most frequentgreeting in spoken American English, hey is a more vernacular form and hello seems tobe more frequently used when respecting the boundaries of the addressee. Greetingsequences also follow a predictable pattern based on the greeting word used or thegreeting questioned asked. More formal terms of address (for example Mr Lastname) are used in more formal settings or when there is a significant age difference betweenspeakers. If a greeting question (how are you?) is posed it is usually returned, answeredor both, and if answered often with a short reply providing minimal information (fine). Hence, both the choice of greeting word and the use of terms of address and greetingquestions are influenced by social factors like age, gender, social class and formality ofsetting according to observable patterns. <b>hi,</b> hey, <b>hello,</b> greetings, adjacency pairs, politeness, Longman Spoken American English Corpus, corpus linguistics, sociolinguistics, phraseolog...|$|R
40|$|Greetings and farewells {{mark the}} {{boundaries}} of conversations; they are often formulaic and are generally claimed to be devoid of propositional content. However, they are often embedded in longer exchanges, and within such exchanges individual expressions {{may or may not}} have propositional content. This contribution discusses some of the inherent problems of retrieving speech acts, such as greetings and farewells, from a corpus. This is illustrated with a diachronic analysis of greetings and farewells in two hundred years of American English as documented in the 400 -million-word Corpus of Historical American English (COHA). In the nineteenth century, the most frequent greetings were “good morning” and “how are you?” and the most frequent leave-taking expression was farewell while in Present-day American English the expressions <b>hi</b> and <b>hello</b> dominate as greetings and goodbye and “bye bye” as leave-taking expressions. The two phrases “how do you do?” and “how are you?” serve as examples that show how formulaic and literal uses have coexisted over the entire period covered by COHA, with a shift from a predominance of literal uses to a predominance of formulaic uses, particularly in the case of “how do you do?”. However, both phrases remain ambiguous in their uses. The interactants discursively assign a more literal or more formulaic force to them...|$|R
30|$|The {{validity}} {{results of}} all the above seven schemes are shown in Figure[*] 8. The validity {{is equal to the}} ratio between the number of valid node in the neighbor table and realistic neighbor. It depends on the number of valid node in the neighbor table because the number of realistic neighbor is fixed. HI has {{a crucial role in the}} number of valid node. Therefore, the shorter HI is, the higher the validity of the hello scheme has. Indeed, TI has a weak influence on the validity because it will delete valid node in the neighbor table by too short TI and the validity will be decreased. In Figure[*] 8, TAP and NAL have the same HI adjustment algorithm. Thus, they have similar validity. For the constant small <b>HI,</b> namely a <b>hello</b> per second, the validity of periodic scheme is better than TAP and NAL in low mobility scenarios. Our hello schemes have a much higher validity, i.e., about 2 % higher than TAP and NAL. In low mobility scenarios, the validity of LAH is similar with the periodic while it is about 2.5 % higher than the periodic. It clarifies that the HI adjustment algorithm of LAH is better availability than the existing schemes in terms of validity.|$|R
