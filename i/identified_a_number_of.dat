5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently drives a Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius repraesentaneus was {{reported}} to have antibiotic activity against Staphylococcus aureus in 1947. The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not <b>identified.</b> <b>A</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F. Repraesentin E showed the strongest growth promotion activity, 164% at 3.6µm, of the three compounds toward the radicle elongation of lettuce seedlings.|$|E
5|$|The {{high-resolution}} spectra {{and images}} {{provided by the}} HST have been especially well-suited to establishing the prevalence of black holes in the nuclei of nearby galaxies. While it had been hypothesized in the early 1960s that black holes would {{be found at the}} centers of some galaxies, and astronomers in the 1980s <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> good black hole candidates, work conducted with Hubble shows that black holes are probably common to the centers of all galaxies. The Hubble programs further established that the masses of the nuclear black holes and properties of the galaxies are closely related. The legacy of the Hubble programs on black holes in galaxies is thus to demonstrate a deep connection between galaxies and their central black holes.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the structural changes that the brain incurs with age, the aging process also entails {{a broad range of}} biochemical changes. More specifically, neurons communicate with each other via specialized chemical messengers called neurotransmitters.

25|$|Several {{candidate}} gene {{studies have found}} associations between idiopathic scoliosis and genes mediating bone formation, bone metabolism, and connective tissue structure. Several genome-wide studies have <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> loci as significantly linked to idiopathic scoliosis. In 2006 idiopathic scoliosis was linked with three microsatellite polymorphisms in the MATN1 gene (encoding for Matrilin 1, cartilage matrix protein). Fifty-three single nucleotide polymorphism markers in the DNA that are significantly associated with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis were identified through a genome-wide association study.|$|E
40|$|Abstract-In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} for validating software measurement. We start by defining a measurement structure model that identifies the elementary component of measures and the measurement process, and then consider five other models involved in measurement: unit definition models, instrumentation models, attribute relationship models, measure-ment protocols and entity population models. We consider <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> measures from the viewpoint of our measurement vali-dation framework and <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> shortcomings; in particular we <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> problems with the construc-tion of function points. We also compare our view of measure-ment validation with ideas presented by other researchers and <b>identify</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> areas of disagreement. Finally, we suggest several rules that practitioners and researchers can use to avoid measurement problems, including the use of measurement vectors rather than artificially contrived scalars.

The task force final report include results of a survey of 278 then current and recent former band members; see Appendix D.

25|$|Studies {{examining}} honokiol as {{a protective}} therapy against focal cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury have <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> anti-inflammatory pathways. Neutrophil infiltration of injured tissues can cause further damage and issues with healing. In in vitro studies, honokiol reduced fMLP (N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine) and PMA (phorbol-12-myristate-13-acetate) induced neutrophil firm adhesion {{which is an}} integral step for infiltration. Honokiol inhibits ROS production in neutrophils. Honokiol also blocks inflammatory factor production in glial cells through the inhibition on NF-κB activation. This mechanism is believed to suppress production of NO, tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), and RANTES/CCL5.|$|E
25|$|Research has <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> OA {{practices}} significantly correlating with maintaining abstinence in OA: {{adherence to}} a food plan (including weighing and measuring food), communication with other members (specifically sponsors), spending time in prayer and meditation, performing service work, completing the fourth step, completing the ninth step, writing down thoughts and feelings, attending meetings, reading OA/AA literature, and the educational status of the participant. Researchers have therefore concluded that application of OA practices might directly help promote abstinence and reduce the frequency of relapse in those with binge eating disorder and bulimia nervosa.|$|E

The results found that the SARS coronavirus could be isolated from masked palm civets (Paguma sp.), even if the animals did not show clinical signs of the virus. The preliminary conclusion was the SARS virus crossed the xenographic barrier from asian palm civet to humans, and more than 10,000 masked palm civets were killed in Guangdong Province. The virus was also later found in raccoon dogs (Nyctereuteus sp.), ferret badgers (Melogale spp.), and domestic cats. In 2005, two studies <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> SARS-like coronaviruses in Chinese bats.|$|E
25|$|Although {{influential}} in the Nixon administration, Usery was unable to persuade the president to refrain from temporarily suspending the Davis-Bacon Act in 1971. The act set wages for construction workers on projects receiving federal funds. But the Vietnam War was putting significant inflationary pressure on construction wages. Although Nixon suspended Davis-Bacon, Usery and others soon convinced Nixon to reinstate Davis-Bacon enforcement and establish a separate body to review contract union contracts. Within a year, the new committee had <b>identified</b> <b>a</b> <b>number</b> <b>of</b> wage increases it had deemed extravagant, and won renegotiation of the agreements. Soon, wage increases on Davis-Bacon projects dropped from 14 percent to 6 percent.|$|E
