25|$|As with <b>environmental</b> <b>economics,</b> {{care must}} be taken to ensure a {{complete}} view of the costs and benefits involved.

25|$|The {{economic}} value of natural capital and ecosystem services is accepted by mainstream <b>environmental</b> <b>economics,</b> but is emphasized as {{especially important in}} ecological economics. Ecological economists may begin by estimating how to maintain a stable environment before assessing the cost in dollar terms. Ecological economist Robert Costanza led an attempted valuation of the global ecosystem in 1997. Initially published in Nature, the article concluded on $33 trillion with a range from $16 trillion to $54 trillion (in 1997, total global GDP was $27 trillion). Half of the value went to nutrient cycling. The open oceans, continental shelves, and estuaries had the highest total value, and the highest per-hectare values went to estuaries, swamps/floodplains, and seagrass/algae beds. The work was criticized by articles in Ecological Economics Volume 25, Issue 1, but the critics acknowledged the positive potential for economic valuation of the global ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|Articles by Inge Ropke (2004, 2005) and Clive Spash (1999) {{cover the}} {{development}} and modern history of ecological economics and explain its differentiation from resource and <b>environmental</b> <b>economics,</b> {{as well as some}} of the controversy between American and European schools of thought. An article by Robert Costanza, David Stern, Lining He, and Chunbo Ma responded to a call by Mick Common to determine the foundational literature of ecological economics by using citation analysis to examine which books and articles have had the most influence on the development of the field. However, citations analysis has itself proven controversial and similar work has been criticized by Clive Spash for attempting to pre-determine what is regarded as influential in ecological economics through study design and data manipulation. In addition, the journal Ecological Economics has itself been criticized for swamping the field with mainstream economics.|$|E

500|$|In economics, the Jevons paradox ( [...] ; {{sometimes}} the Jevons effect) occurs when technological progress increases the efficiency with which a resource is used (reducing the amount necessary {{for any one}} use), but the rate of consumption of that resource rises because of increasing demand. The Jevons paradox {{is perhaps the most}} widely known paradox in <b>environmental</b> <b>economics.</b> However, governments and environmentalists generally assume that efficiency gains will lower resource consumption, ignoring the possibility of the paradox arising.|$|E
500|$|The FairTax {{would be}} tax free on {{mortgage}} interest {{up to the}} federal borrowing rate for like-term instruments {{as determined by the}} Treasury, but since savings, education, and other investments would be tax free under the plan, the FairTax could decrease the incentive to spend more on homes. [...] An analysis in 2008 by the Baker Institute For Public Policy concluded that the FairTax would have significant transitional issues for the housing sector since the investment would no longer be tax-favored. In a 2007 study, the Beacon Hill Institute concluded that total charitable giving would increase under the FairTax, although increases in giving would not be distributed proportionately amongst the various types of charitable organizations. The FairTax may also affect state and local government debt as the federal income tax system provides tax advantages to municipal bonds. Proponents believe environmental benefits would result from the FairTax through <b>environmental</b> <b>economics</b> and the re-use and re-sale of used goods. Advocates argue the FairTax would provide an incentive for illegal immigrants to legalize as they would otherwise not receive the rebate. Proponents also believe that the FairTax would have positive effects on civil liberties that are sometimes charged against the income tax system, such as social inequality, economic inequality, financial privacy, self-incrimination, unreasonable search and seizure, burden of proof, and due process.|$|E
500|$|By this logic, market-based {{solutions}} to ecological crises (ecological economics, <b>environmental</b> <b>economics,</b> green economy) are rejected as technical tweaks {{that do not}} confront capitalism's structural failures. [...] "Low-risk" [...] technology/science-based solutions such as solar power, sustainable agriculture, and increases in energy efficiency are seen as necessary but insufficient. [...] "High-risk" [...] technological solutions such as nuclear power and climate engineering are entirely rejected. Attempts made by businesses to [...] "greenwash" [...] their practices are regarded as false advertising, and it is pointed out that implementation of renewable technology (such as Walmart's proposition to supply their electricity with solar power) has the effect opposite of reductions in resource consumption, viz. further economic growth. Sustainable business models and the triple bottom line are viewed as morally praiseworthy but ignorant to the tendency in capitalism for the distribution of wealth to become increasingly unequal and socially unstable/unsustainable. Ecosocialists claim that the general unwillingness of capitalists to tolerate—and capitalist governments to implement—constraints on maximum profit (such as ecotaxes or preservation and conservation measures) renders environmental reforms incapable of facilitating large-scale change: [...] "History teaches us that although capitalism has at times responded to environmental movements ... at a certain point, at which the system's underlying accumulation drive is affected, its resistance to environmental demands stiffens." [...] They also note that, up until the event of total ecological collapse, destruction caused by natural disasters generally causes an increase in economic growth and accumulation; thus, capitalists have no foreseeable motivation to reduce the probability of disasters (i.e. convert to sustainable/ecological production).|$|E
