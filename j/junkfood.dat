5000|$|The series {{follows the}} misadventures {{of a group}} of young men, who live in the small village of Maaskantje in North Brabant. Maaskantje's {{distinctly}} rustic and pleasant appearance as a traditional village is juxtaposed by the actions of the group, who are antisocial and indulge in the 'Gabber' culture. They drink excessively, eat <b>junkfood</b> and ride noisily around the village in a garish Opel Manta. Just about every sentence they speak is mindlessly punctuated by the expletive 'kut' ('cunt', {{it should be noted that}} in Dutch this word doesn't carry the same severity as it does in American English, although it is nevertheless considered rude). Although most of the characters work, none of them appear particularly adept in their jobs.|$|E

Henny's other efforts dealt with subjects such as unhappy marriages (Is Dit Alles), failure to quit cigarettes, <b>junkfood</b> and alcohol (OK) and desperately searching for a warm embrace (Radeloos). Ernst delivered songs about getting the cold shoulder (Situatie), sleeping with a 17-year-old (Belle Helene, featuring a sax-solo from the man himself) and dumping a girl for being overexperienced (De Eerste Keer). With Joost he co-wrote Nachtmerrie Op Hol (Nightmare On The Loose) about dreams of revisited exams.|$|E

40|$|Background Type 2 {{diabetes}} mellitus is increasingly observed among children, and adolescents. The International Diabetes Foundation (IDF) says, “Diabetes and obesity {{are the biggest}} public health challenge of the 21 st century”. Of the people diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, about 80 to 90 percent are also diagnosed as obese. This fact provides an interesting clue to the link between diabetes and obesity, where high calories intake {{as the result of}} eating junk food will lead to obesity and this will increase insulin resistance and ended up as type 2 {{diabetes mellitus}}. Material and Methods This study combined survey and literature review. We surveyed 100 random samples of junk food consumers directly at fast food restaurants in Makassar, South Celebes, Indonesia. The aim {{of this study is to}} know whether consumers choose <b>junkfood</b> restaurants because of the taste or facilities, and consumers ’ reasons on why they choose <b>junkfood</b> restaurants rather than healthier one based on price, serving time, place, availability, and facilities. Those data converted to charts and accompanied by several explanations, then we search for several theories and previous researches about what goods about healthier ideal restaurant. A...|$|E
40|$|An {{expected}} lifetime-utility maximizing diet of junk {{and health}} food is analyzed. The stationary junk-food consumption level {{is equal to}} the ratio of the recovery capacity of a perfectly healthy person to the sensitivity of her health to junk food. The greater the difference between the relative taste and the stationary relative price of junk food, rate of time preference, and elasticity of satisfaction from food, the better the stationary health of the rational junk-food consumer. The greater the full capacity income, recovery capacity, and health sensitivity to junk-food, the worse the stationary health of the rational <b>junkfood</b> consumer. ...|$|E
40|$|Junk-food consumption, {{health and}} {{productivity}} are analyzed within an expectedlifetime- utility-maximizing {{framework in which}} the probability of living and productivity rise with health and health deteriorate with the consumption of <b>junkfood.</b> So long that the junk food’s relative taste-price differential is positive, the rational diet deviates from the physiologically optimal and renders the levels of health and productivity lower than the maximal. Taxing junk-food can eliminate this discrepancy but the outcome is not Pareto-superior. The value {{of health and the}} stationary junk-food consumption and health depend on the relative taste-price differential, survival and satisfaction elasticities and time preference-rate. junk-food, healthy-food, relative taste, relative price, health, risk, lifequality,productivity, rationality, self-control...|$|E
