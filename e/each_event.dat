5|$|During these inaugural Olympics, {{winners were}} given a silver medal and an olive branch, while runners-up {{received}} a copper medal and a laurel branch. The IOC has retroactively assigned gold, silver and bronze medals to the three best placed athletes in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> to comport with more recent traditions.|$|E
5|$|Seven athletes {{qualified}} in {{the swimming}} events - six in individual events and one (Keren Siebner) in the relay events. The qualifying standards {{are up to}} a maximum of 2 swimmers in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> at the Olympic Qualifying Time (OQT), and potentially 1 at the Olympic Selection Time (OST).|$|E
5|$|A medal {{ceremony}} is held after <b>each</b> <b>event</b> is concluded. The winner, second and third-place competitors or teams stand {{on top of}} a three-tiered rostrum to be awarded their respective medals. After the medals are given out by a CGF member, the national flags of the three medallists are raised while the national anthem of the gold medallist's country plays. Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies, as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag-bearers.|$|E

5|$|Both {{versions}} {{feature a}} gallery mode where brief {{facts about the}} Olympics can be found. There are five categories of Olympics-related trivia organized by history and athletes, with corresponding minigames that will unlock the answer to trivia questions once completed. Classic music from both series {{is available in the}} gallery once all levels in a category are cleared. The two versions also have leaderboards that uses the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection to display the best times and scores in <b>each</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E
5|$|Combined (or multi-discipline) {{events are}} {{competitions}} in which athletes {{participate in a}} number of track and field events, earning points for their performance in <b>each</b> <b>event,</b> which adds to a total points score. Outdoors, the most common combined events are the men's decathlon (ten events) and the women's heptathlon (seven events). Due to stadium limitations, indoor combined events competition have a reduced number of events, resulting in the men's heptathlon and the women's pentathlon. Athletes are allocated points based on an international-standard points scoring system, such as the decathlon scoring table.|$|E
5|$|In 2017 it was {{announced}} and confirmed from both ESL (http://en.pro.eslgaming.com/) and Odense that the worlds largest e-sport event ESL Pro league Offline was to be held from the 8'th of December - 10'th of December, in 'Sparekassen Fyn arena' which is able to seat around 4000 People. This might {{prove to be a}} problem as all previous tournaments has housed around 10.000-15.000 people at <b>each</b> <b>event.</b>|$|E

5|$|Pilotwings is {{an amateur}} flight {{simulator}} {{game in which}} the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, {{and the use of}} a rocket belt. Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. <b>Each</b> <b>event</b> offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{book was}} {{released}} in October 2008 as Atwood began the Massey lecture series in St. John's, Newfoundland, on October 12. The second lecture took place in Vancouver on the 15th, followed by Winnipeg on the 17th, Montreal on the 20th, and ending on November 1 in Toronto. The series was recorded then aired on CBC Radio One's Ideas between November 10 and 14. At <b>each</b> <b>event</b> Atwood fielded questions from the audience and participated in book signings.|$|E
5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on {{the distance that}} the object is thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group of}} athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E

5|$|At Stockholm, Brundage {{finished}} {{sixth in}} the pentathlon and 16th in the decathlon. Far behind on points, after eight events {{he dropped out of}} the decathlon, which he always regretted. He later moved up one spot in the standings in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> when his fellow American, Jim Thorpe, who had won both events, was disqualified after it was shown that he had played baseball for money: this meant Thorpe was considered a professional, not an amateur as was required for Olympic participation. Throughout his tenure as president, Brundage refused to ask the IOC to restore Thorpe's medals despite advocacy by Thorpe supporters. The committee eventually did so in 1982, after the deaths of both men. Brundage's refusal led to charges that he held a grudge for being beaten in Stockholm.|$|E
5|$|Carpentier’s {{historical}} {{account is}} greatly simplified {{in order to}} increase the contrast between the white land owners and their black slaves. The marvellous, one of the most notable features of the novel, is used as a marker of contrast between the two groups: firstly, because mention of the magical always takes the form of the slaves' point of view, while the more real interpretation of <b>each</b> <b>event</b> is from the whites' perspective; secondly, because the marvellous is used as a weapon to fight injustice. Instances of cruelty and violence between the groups are recounted grotesquely in great detail, which enhances the rivalry. More importantly, by allowing readers to see through the slaves' point of view, Carpentier brings to light the power and durability of the Haitian community and destabilizes the narrative of Western supremacy.|$|E
50|$|They have {{different}} prices for <b>each</b> <b>events</b> shown, this means one {{could buy a}} pass just for 1 event which would cost {{in the region of}} $5.99, or a monthly pass for $9.99.|$|R
5000|$|The main {{qualifying}} criterion was the BWF Ranking list as of May 3, 2012. It {{provided a}} total of 16 pairs in <b>each</b> doubles <b>event</b> and 38 athletes in <b>each</b> singles <b>event,</b> in the following manner: ...|$|R

5|$|Each pupil is {{assigned}} to one of the six houses upon joining the school, and a pupil's house can be indicated to others by optional colour-related clothing. If someone joins as the second in their direct family to do so, they are put in the same house as their relative. There are inter-house competitions throughout the year (including rugby, hockey, reading, and chess) and then {{at the end of the}} year the points awarded in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> throughout the year are added up, and the house with most points is awarded the Cock House Cup, which is the traditional name given in British public schools for the in-school competition cup.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic Movement {{consists}} of international sports federations (IFs), National Olympic Committees (NOCs), and organising committees for each specific Olympic Games. As the decision-making body, the IOC {{is responsible for}} choosing the host city for each Games, and organises and funds the Games according to the Olympic Charter. The IOC also determines the Olympic programme, consisting of the sports to be contested at the Games. There are several Olympic rituals and symbols, such as the Olympic flag and torch, {{as well as the}} opening and closing ceremonies. Over 13,000 athletes compete at the Summer and Winter Olympic Games in 33 different sports and nearly 400 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> receive Olympic medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{games are}} {{overseen by the}} Commonwealth Games Federation (CGF), which also {{controls}} the sporting programme and selects the host cities. The games movement consists ofinternational sports federations(IFs), (CGAs), and organising committees for each specific Commonwealth Games. There are several rituals and symbols, such as theCommonwealth Games flagandQueen's Baton, as well as theopening and closing ceremonies. Over 5,000 athletes compete at the Commonwealth Games in more than 15 different sports and more than 250 events. The first, second, and third-place finishers in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> receiveCommonwealth Games medals: gold, silver, and bronze, respectively. Apart from many Olympic sports, the games also include some sports that are played predominantly in Commonwealth countries, such as lawn bowls and netball.|$|E

5|$|With Lorentz symmetry, {{additional}} structures {{come into}} play. They {{are defined by}} the set of light cones (see image). The light-cones define a causal structure: for <b>each</b> <b>event</b> A, there {{is a set of}} events that can, in principle, either influence or be influenced by A via signals or interactions that do not need to travel faster than light (such as event B in the image), and a set of events for which such an influence is impossible (such as event C in the image). These sets are observer-independent. In conjunction with the world-lines of freely falling particles, the light-cones can be used to reconstruct the space–time's semi-Riemannian metric, at least up to a positive scalar factor. In mathematical terms, this defines a conformal structure or conformal geometry.|$|E
5|$|Both {{versions}} of Mario & Sonic at the Olympic Games have three similar modes of gameplay: Circuit mode, Single Match, and Mission mode. Circuit mode is where players {{compete for the}} highest overall score in a pre-determined series of events or design their own circuit. In the Single Match, players can choose to compete in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> individually. Mission mode is a single-player option where each of the competitors has six character-specific missions to complete, although the characters' statistics are not as balanced as in the main game, making missions more difficult. The Wii version's Circuit and Single Match can have an additional one to three players competing simultaneously while its DS counterpart has an extra option dedicated to multiplayer called Versus Play. Versus supports up to four people to use the wireless capabilities of the Nintendo DS to play events. DS Download Play is possible for those without an individual copy of the game, however the number of sports available is limited to six events and circuit mode is not available.|$|E
5|$|During the {{preliminary}} round at the World Championships, Sacramone {{qualified for the}} event finals on floor and vault {{and contributed to the}} top-qualifying position of the American team. She also posted a score on beam that would have been high enough to qualify her to the beam final. However, due to an International Federation of Gymnastics rule allowing only two athletes per country to participate in <b>each</b> <b>event</b> final, Sacramone was unable to compete for a beam medal, because teammates Liukin and Shawn Johnson qualified ahead of her. In the team final, she competed on vault, beam and floor, earning scores of 15.750, 15.600 and 15.325, respectively. When the American team faltered after a difficult beam rotation, in which two gymnasts made major errors, Sacramone gathered the team for a pep talk to refocus them for floor. The American team earned 184.400 points overall, which was good enough to secure the gold medal ahead of China and Romania.|$|E
30|$|Water {{applied to}} each {{replication}} plot was measured after <b>each</b> irrigation <b>event</b> {{during the study}} period. Since the irrigation ditches are lined with concrete and individual plots were irrigated in sequence, {{it was possible to}} measure amount of irrigation water applied fairly accurately. Amount of irrigation water applied at <b>each</b> irrigation <b>event</b> was measured by monitoring volume of irrigation water (flow rate in concrete lined irrigation ditches × area of cross section of water × duration of irrigation at <b>each</b> irrigation <b>event).</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to the analysis of time symmetry in light curves, such as those in the x-ray {{at the center of the}} Scorpius X- 1 occultation debate. Our method uses a new parameterization for such events (the bilogistic event profile) and provides a clear, physically relevant characterization of <b>each</b> <b>event’s</b> key features. We also demonstrate a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to carry out this analysis, including a novel independence chain configuration for the estimation of <b>each</b> <b>event’s</b> location in the light curve. These tools are applied to the Scorpius X- 1 light curves presented in Chang et al. (2007), providing additional evidence based on the time series that the events detected thus far are most likely not occultations by TNOs...|$|R
