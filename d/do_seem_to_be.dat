Since moving to the new stadium, Wigan Warriors' success in rugby league has not been as high as it was at their old Central Park ground, however the good times <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> back for the club after they won the Super League Grand Final and League Leaders shield in 2010 under the {{guidance}} of coach Michael Maguire and chairman Ian Lenagan.|$|E
5|$|One major {{manifestation of}} the North–South divide is in health and life {{expectancy}} statistics. All three Northern England statistical regions have lower than average life expectancies and higher than average rates of cancer, circulatory disease and respiratory disease. Blackpool has the lowest life expectancy at birth in England – male life expectancy at birth between 2012 and 2014 was 74.7, against an England-wide average of 79.5 – {{and the majority of}} English districts in the bottom 50 were in the North East or the North West. However, regional differences <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> slowly narrowing: between 1991–1993 and 2012–2014, life expectancy in the North East increased by 6.0 years and in the North West by 5.8 years, the fastest increase in any region outside London, and the gap between life expectancy in the North East and South East is now 2.5 years, down from 2.9 in 1993.|$|E
25|$|The {{findings}} of this study may be applicable to other work settings, including factories, restaurants, offices, and universities. The study concludes that individual strategies for coping with sexual harassment {{are not likely to be}} effective and may have unexpected negative consequences for the workplace and may even lead to increased sexual harassment. Women who try to deal with sexual harassment on their own, regardless of what they <b>do,</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in a no-win situation.|$|E

25|$|It is in Venice that {{he first}} smoked hashish and, rather than studying, began {{to spend time}} frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these {{lifestyle}} choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more than simple teenage rebellion, or the cliched hedonism and bohemianism that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of Nietzsche.|$|E
2500|$|John Gribbin and Martin Rees wrote a {{detailed}} history and defence of the fine-tuning argument {{in their book}} Cosmic Coincidences (1989). According to Gribbin and Rees, [...] "The conditions in our Universe really <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> uniquely suitable for life forms like ourselves, and perhaps even for any form of organic complexity. But the question remains - is the Universe tailor-made for man?" ...|$|E

2500|$|David Brooks {{reviewed}} the follow-up {{book about the}} next generation titled Millennials Rising (2000). [...] "Millennials" [...] is a term coined by Strauss and Howe. Brooks wrote: “This {{is not a good}} book, if by good you mean the kind of book in which the authors have rigorously sifted the evidence and carefully supported their assertions with data. But it is a very good bad book. It's stuffed with interesting nuggets. It's brightly written. And if you get away from the generational mumbo jumbo, it illuminates changes that really <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taking place.” [...] Further, Mr. Brooks wrote that the generations aren't treated equally: [...] "Basically, it sounds as if America has two greatest generations {{at either end of the}} age scale and two crummiest in the middle".|$|E
2500|$|Bernice Green: Red's wife, whom {{he married}} {{without waiting for}} the results of the {{pregnancy}} test. Red claims they had tried to have children but after Harold was born they took that as a warning. She is often exasperated with the antics of Red and the other lodge members and often tries to encourage Red to partake in activities like the arts and eating at fine restaurants, usually to disastrous effect. In once episode she faked a love letter from one of Red's old girlfriends (which {{turned out to be an}} affectionate letter from Red's mother) and Red resolved to take Bernice out to dinner any night the episode aired to prevent her from seeing it and becoming jealous. In spite of this she and Red <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> close, and Red often implies they have an active sex life. Bernice has a niece named Alicia whose oral condition has earned her the nickname [...] "Horse". At one point Harold considered marrying her out of desperation.|$|E
2500|$|On August 27, 2008, Mediabistro wrote a {{piece about}} the Big Three network newscasts, praising Couric's Evening News for {{extensive}} reporting that had, in its opinion, content better than its rivals. Another critic from MarketWatch praised Couric's work and said that people should watch out for her in 2009. Washington Post writer Tom Shales praised Couric as a warmer, more benevolent presence than her two competitors, something that she brought to the program nearly 16 years of goodwill from doing [...] "Today" [...] and becoming America's sweetheart, or else very close to it, and he claimed that this goodwill remained. Shales added that viewers [...] "may find bad news less discomforting and sleep-depriving if Couric gives it to them". He also added {{that she does not}} try to [...] "sugarcoat" [...] or [...] "prettify" [...] grim realities. According to Shales, the Evening News may be a more hospitable, welcoming sort of place than its competitors. He concluded by stating that [...] "it's naive to think that viewers choose their news anchor based solely on strict journalistic credentials, though Couric's <b>do</b> <b>seem</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> in order, despite her critics' claims".|$|E
