The Chadian government has actively promoted Chadian culture and national traditions by opening the Chad National Museum and the Chad Cultural Centre.

5|$|According {{to popular}} tradition, Sir Ralph de Assheton, who was {{lord of the}} manor in the mid-14thcentury and known as the Black Knight, was an unpopular and cruel feudal lord. After his death, his unpopularity led the locals to parade an effigy of him around the town each <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> and collect money. Afterwards the effigy would be hung up, shot, and set on fire, before being torn apart and thrown into the crowd. The first {{recorded}} occurrence of the event was in 1795, although the tradition may be older; it continued into the 1830s.|$|E

5|$|Ellen {{was born}} on 24 October 1856 in Walworth, London, at the Bricklayer's Arms public house run by her father, George Elliot. In adult life, {{she worked as a}} needlewoman and in a jute {{processing}} factory. In 1883, she had an illegitimate daughter, also called Ellen, who died in Poplar workhouse in December 1885. Within a year of the death of her daughter, she began working for Martin. In March 1888, Ellen and William left Martin's employ and moved to a furnished room at 3 Swaton Road, Bow, where they lived together until their marriage on <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday,</b> 2 April 1888, at Bromley Parish Church. Martin later said he had dismissed William because of unpaid debts.|$|E
5|$|On <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday,</b> 24 April 1916, {{units of}} the Irish Volunteers and the Irish Citizen Army seized several {{prominent}} buildings and streets in central Dublin, including the General Post Office (GPO) in Sackville Street, one of the buildings nearest the Pillar. They set up headquarters at the GPO where they declared an Irish Republic under a provisional government. One of the first recorded actions of the Easter Rising occurred near the Pillar when lancers from the nearby Marlborough Street barracks, sent to investigate the disturbance, were fired on from the GPO. They withdrew in confusion, leaving four soldiers and two horses dead.|$|E
5|$|Public {{holidays}} in Rhodesia, {{a historical}} region in southern Africa equivalent to today's Zimbabwe and Zambia—formerly Southern and Northern Rhodesia, respectively—were largely based around milestones in the region's short history. Annual holidays marked {{various aspects of}} the arrival of white people during the 1880s and 1890s, as well as the respective unilateral declarations of independence (1965) and of republican government (1970). On these days, most businesses and non-essential services closed. A number of Christian holidays were also observed according to custom, in the traditional British manner, and referred to in official documents by name—Christmas Day, for example, or <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday.</b>|$|E

5000|$|In the 18th century a small calvary {{was built}} {{on the top of the}} hill which was rebuilt around 1820. On <b>Easter</b> <b>Mondays</b> a {{procession}} climbed the steep road leading to the calvary to celebrate the resurrection of Christ. Many tents and vendors were erected on the nearby meadow. The emmausjárás (Emmaus-walk) or tojásbúcsú (egg feast) was one of the most popular Catholic holidays of the year during the 18th-19th centuries.|$|R
5|$|Póvoa de Varzim's most {{relevant}} garden squares are Praça do Almada (19th century) and Praça Luiz de Camões (20th century). Near the A28 motorway, {{there are three}} small parks: Espaço Agros, Argivai Picnic Park (Parque de Merendas de Argivai), and Travessa de Calves Green Space. Espaço Agros is a private-sponsored park with 22 hectare in the former Anjo woodland. This woodland was damaged by the construction of high speed roads {{in the beginning of}} the 1990s. Agros kept the essential rural setting, with some landscaping and environmental improvements, including a small lake. This is also the location of the city-owned Picnic Park, used for <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> picnics.|$|E
5|$|The Author's Farce and the Pleasures of the Town {{was written}} during 1729. The first press {{announcement}} of the play appeared on 18 March 1730 in the Daily Post, stating {{that it was in}} rehearsal. An advertisement appeared in the same newspaper shortly afterwards mentioning restricted seating and high ticket prices, suggesting that the play was expected to be a popular entertainment. It opened on <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday,</b> 30 March 1730, at the Little Theatre, Haymarket, and shortly thereafter was billed alongside The Cheats of Scapin. The last act was later made into the companion piece to Hurlothrumbo for one show.|$|E
5|$|The Lombard {{migration}} {{started on}} <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday,</b> April 2, 568. The decision {{to combine the}} departure with a Christian celebration can be understood {{in the context of}} Alboin's recent conversion to Arian Christianity, as attested by the presence of Arian Gothic missionaries at his court. The conversion is likely to have been motivated mostly from political considerations, and intended to consolidate the migration's cohesion, distinguishing them from the Catholic Romans. It also connected Alboin and his people to the Gothic heritage, and in this way obtain the support of the Ostrogoths serving in the Byzantine army as foederati. It has been speculated that Alboin's migration could have been partly the result of a call from surviving Ostrogoths in Italy.|$|E

50|$|First, the club’s 13-match {{losing streak}} (rounds 17, 1998 to 7, 1999) {{came to an}} end, Buckley {{returning}} from a broken jaw suffered in round two on <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday’s</b> loss to Carlton to pilot the side to a well celebrated win {{in the mud and}} slush of the MCG. Buckley’s return to action was heralded with four goals of his own and three Brownlow Votes, and the team overcame fellow cellar dweller Fremantle. If it wasn’t for his untimely jaw injury, suffered when his head collided with Blue wingman Justin Murphy’s knee, Buckley may well have won his first Brownlow Medal, finishing equal third with Blues ruckman Matthew Allan on 20 votes, eight behind overall winner Shane Crawford.|$|R
5|$|The {{tradition}} of the dole continues to the present, and every <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> tea, cheese and bread are given to local widows and pensioners {{through the windows of}} Biddenden's former workhouse. All those eligible for the annual dole are given a Biddenden cake, and they are sold as souvenirs to visitors. The cakes are baked so hard as to be inedible, to allow better preservation as souvenirs; they are baked in large batches every few years and kept until the stock runs out. Historically, the loaves used were of the archaic quartern loaf size, but this particular part of the tradition ended when Biddenden's last bakery closed in the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Bardanes is {{probably}} identical with the patrikios Bardanios who {{appears in the}} Chronicle of Theophanes the Confessor in the mid-790s. In 795, he was Domestic of the Schools (commander of the Scholai guards), and was dispatched to arrest the monk Plato of Sakkoudion for his public opposition to the second marriage of Emperor Constantine VI (r. 780–797) to Plato's niece Theodote. In 797, as strategos (military governor) of the Thracesian Theme, this same Bardanios supported the Empress-mother Irene of Athens when she usurped the throne from her son. On <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday,</b> 1 April 799, he is recorded {{as one of the}} four patrikioi (along with Niketas Triphyllios, Sisinnios Triphyllios and Constantine Boilas) who led the horses of the Empress's carriage on a unique triumphal procession from the palace to the Church of the Holy Apostles.|$|E
5|$|In a {{move that}} was {{described}} {{as an act of}} hurt pride by social historian David Smith, but also as a manoeuvre to appease the Welsh supporters, in February 1897 the WFU wrote to the IRFB and withdrew their membership. The WFU claimed that they alone had authority over the matter because the IRFB did not have any rules regarding amateurism. The WFU then reinstated their subscription to Gould, and on <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> 1897 a banquet was arranged at Drill Hall in Newport in Gould's honour. Many civic and sporting worthies were in attendance to witness the WFU president Sir John Llewellyn present Gould with the title deeds of a gift house. The 250 guests, including David A. Thomas, were joined by a reed and string orchestra, the band of the Fourth Battalion of the South Wales Borderers, and galleries packed by members of the public.|$|E
5000|$|Until 1893, Towcester {{served as}} a {{junction}} station for services to Olney railway station, {{as well as an}} interchange for Blisworth to Banbury services and Blisworth to Stratford services. Around four services a day called from Olney to provide a connection with Stratford services. The 1920s saw Towcester at its busiest on weekday mornings at 9am, with three passenger services scheduled to depart: one for Banbury, one for Broom and one for Blisworth. The station also saw special services for Towcester Racecourse, which was particularly known for the Grafton Hunt Steeplechase on <b>Easter</b> <b>Mondays</b> which attracted between 7,000 and 8,000 visitors to the town.

5000|$|The Fuquay Mineral Spring's {{popularity}} grew {{around the}} start of the 20th century, especially in the 1890s as local businessman John Mills developed the idea to offer [...] "Moonlight Excursions" [...] to the springs. He fitted flat rail cars with seats and offered nighttime train trips to southern Wake County from Raleigh. As more guests came to the springs to [...] "take the waters", a group of small hotels sprung up in town, along with restaurants, barbecue stands, and a dance pavilion with a player piano. The town became a tourist destination and was the site of special celebrations on Fourths of July and <b>Easter</b> <b>Mondays.</b> During these events, residents of Raleigh would take the train down to watch the accompanying baseball games and participate in the dances and celebrations. Hotels like the Ben Wiley Hotel catered to the out-of-towners and became as much a center of town life as the springs. In 1902, Sippihaw was renamed [...] "Fuquay Springs" [...] in honor of its founding family and was officially incorporated in 1909.|$|R

This {{was the first of}} 100 Keegan Liverpool goals and a {{successful}} strike partnership with Toshack. 18 year old Phil Thompson debuted as a substitute in a 3-0 <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> win over Manchester United. Liverpool contesting a four-way title fight lost 1-0 in their penultimate game at Brian Clough's Derby County who had now completed their fixtures. On Monday 8 May 1972, Leeds' 2-1 loss at Wolverhampton Wanderers gave Liverpool their bite at the title. Needing to win the same evening if Leeds lost, Liverpool drew 0-0 at Arsenal with Shankly furious an 88th minute Toshack goal was disallowed. Derby stayed top.|$|E
5|$|In 1723, Bach was {{appointed}} as Thomaskantor (director of church music) in Leipzig, {{where he was}} responsible for the music at four churches and for the training and education of boys singing in the Thomanerchor. He took office {{in the middle of the}} liturgical year, on the first Sunday after Trinity. In his first twelve months in office, Bach decided to compose new works for almost all liturgical events, known as his first cantata cycle. The year after, he continued that effort, composing chorale cantatas based on Lutheran hymns. He kept the format of the chorale cantata cycle until Palm Sunday of 1725, but then repeated an early Easter cantata, Christ lag in Todes Banden, BWV 4, on Easter Sunday, and wrote Bleib bei uns, denn es will Abend werden for <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> as the first cantata in that cycle that was not a chorale cantata. The change was possibly due to the loss of a librettist.|$|E
5|$|Public schools allow {{religious}} education, {{in cooperation}} with religious communities that have agreements with the government, but attendance is not mandatory. The classes are organized widely in public elementary and secondary schools. In 2009, 92% of elementary school pupils and 87% of secondary school students attended the religious education classes. Public holidays in Croatia also include the religious festivals of Epiphany, <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday,</b> Corpus Christi Day, Assumption Day, All Saints' Day, Christmas, and St. Stephen's or Boxing Day. The religious festival public holidays {{are based on the}} Catholic liturgical year, but citizens of the Republic of Croatia who celebrate different religious holidays have the right not to work on those dates. This includes Christians who celebrate Christmas on 7 January per the Julian calendar, Muslims on the days of Ramadan Bayram and Kurban Bayram, and Jews on the days of Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur. Marriages performed by the religious communities having agreements with the state are officially recognized, eliminating the need to register the marriages in a registrar office.|$|E

5000|$|The first calvary on Gellért Hill {{was built}} in 1715 by a citizen of Buda on the {{initiative}} of the Jesuit Order. The simple structure {{was made up of}} two stone sculptures and a wood crucifix. In 1795 Füll (or Fühl) Mihály started a public fundraising to build a new group instead of the old one which was already decaying. The magistrate of Buda supported the effort but it took decades to realize. In 1822 the calvary was described as [...] "recentius a Cive Michaele Fühl exstructa" [...] (recently built by Fühl Mihály). The road to the new group was lined by stations whose paintings depicted the sufferings of Christ. On <b>Easter</b> <b>Mondays</b> a procession climbed the steep road leading to the calvary to celebrate the resurrection. Tents and vendors were erected on a nearby meadow. The emmausjárás (Emmaus-walk) or tojásbúcsú (egg feast) {{was one of the most}} popular Catholic holidays of the year during the 18-19th centuries. In 1873 the citizens of the Tabán district repaired a few stations and decorated them with new paintings, painted on wood by „C. Sauer”. Many stations were demolished in the 1920s. Only three of them were still standing in the 1930s. The last photo about the building was made in 1943. The calvary was demolished around 1950.|$|R
5|$|As Antoine {{decided to}} model Antoinist {{holidays}} on Catholicism, followers celebrate Christian holidays, including All Saints, Christmas, Easter, <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> and Ascension; these days, appropriate portions of Antoine's works are read during the services. There are also three special days in Antoinism, and attendance at worship is generally higher at these moments: (1) 25 June, the Father's Day. It {{was established by}} Antoine's wife shortly after his death. At first, from 1913, all the temples except the one in Jemeppe were closed {{that day in the}} purpose that followers came to attend the ceremony in that city. So many Antoinists performed a pilgrimage to Jemeppe-sur-Meuse to participate in a procession through the city which outlined the main events of Antoine's life. The procession was withdrawn in 1937 and the pilgrimage seems to be no longer organized. That day, the faithful pay homage to the founder in the temples. (2) 15 August, the consecration of the temple's Day, which commemorates the consecration of the first temple. In 1911, on that day, the General Operation took place at the temple, then the ceremony continued into a public hall, which shocked followers; therefore, the following year, the whole ceremony took place exclusively in the temple. (3) 3 November, the Mother's Day, as anniversary of Catherine's death.|$|E
5|$|In July 1972 Peter Cormack signed from Nottingham Forest equaling {{the record}} £110,000 fee Liverpool paid for John Toshack. Shankly {{described}} Cormack's signature as, 'The final {{piece in the}} jigsaw' of that team. In the 1972–73 season they duly won the League and the club's first European trophy, the UEFA Cup. Cormack and Keegan scored in a 2-0 <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> showdown with title rivals, Don Revie's Leeds United. Fellow title contenders Arsenal only drew at Southampton the same day. Liverpool needing a final game draw for the title drew 0-0 at home versus Leicester City. Their eighth League title equalled the record held by Arsenal and was their first captained by a non-Scot, Tommy Smith. A 1973 UEFA Cup Final downpour meant the home first leg was abandoned after 27 minutes. Shankly in those 27 minutes felt the Borussia Mönchengladbach defence was suspect in the air. Shankly started tall forward, John Toshack, in the re-arranged game demoting the small build of Brian Hall to a substitute appearance in a 3-0 win. Toshack headed assists for two Keegan strikes with Lloyd also heading a goal. A 2–0 second leg, away loss meant Liverpool won 3–2 on aggregate. They were the first English team to win the League and a UEFA competiton in the same season.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday 3 April 1888, {{following}} the <b>Easter</b> <b>Monday</b> bank holiday, prostitute Emma Elizabeth Smith was assaulted and robbed {{at the junction}} of Osborn Street and Brick Lane, Whitechapel, {{in the early hours}} of the morning. Although injured, she survived the attack and managed to walk back to her lodging house at 18 George Street, Spitalfields. She told the deputy keeper, Mary Russell, that she had been attacked by two or three men, one of them a youth. Mrs Russell took Smith to the London Hospital, where medical examination revealed that a blunt object had been inserted into her vagina, rupturing her peritoneum. She developed peritonitis and died at 9am on 4 April 1888. The inquest was conducted on 7 April by the coroner for East Middlesex, Wynne Edwin Baxter, who also conducted inquests on six of the later victims. The local inspector of the Metropolitan Police, Edmund Reid of H Division Whitechapel, investigated the attack but the culprits were never caught. Walter Dew, a detective constable stationed with H Division, later wrote that he thought Smith was the first victim of Jack the Ripper, but his colleagues suspected it was the work of a criminal gang. Smith claimed that she was attacked by a group of men, but either refused to or could not describe them. Prostitutes were often managed by gangs, and Smith could have been attacked by her pimps as a punishment for disobeying them, or as part of their intimidation. She may not have identified her attackers because she feared reprisal, and her murder is unlikely to be connected with the later killings.|$|E
50|$|The area {{takes its}} name from St Ann's Well, a spring once thought to have magical healing powers, at the {{junction}} of The Wells Road and Kildare Road. It was also known as The Brodewell, the Owswell, Robin Hood's Well, in records dating back to 1301. The people of Nottingham used to walk to St Ann's Well on <b>Easter</b> ('Black') <b>Monday</b> and celebrate with a party.
