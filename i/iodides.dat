5|$|Most of the <b>iodides</b> of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the {{lanthanides}} and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular <b>iodides,</b> as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Ionic <b>iodides</b> MIn tend to have the lowest melting and boiling points among the halides MXn of the same element, because the electrostatic forces of attraction between the cations and anions are weakest for the large iodide anion. In contrast, covalent <b>iodides</b> tend to instead have the highest melting and boiling points among the halides of the same element, since iodine is the most polarisable of the halogens and, having the most electrons among them, can contribute the most to van der Waals forces. Naturally, exceptions abound in intermediate <b>iodides</b> where one trend {{gives way to the}} other. Similarly, solubilities in water of predominantly ionic <b>iodides</b> (e.g. potassium and calcium) are the greatest among ionic halides of that element, while those of covalent <b>iodides</b> (e.g. silver) are the lowest of that element. In particular, silver iodide is very insoluble in water and its formation is often used as a qualitative test for iodine.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} that manganese oxides can initiate {{the formation of}} methyl <b>iodide,</b> a volatile compound that participates to the input of iodine into the atmosphere. The formation of methyl <b>iodide</b> was investigated using a natural manganese oxide in batch experiments for different conditions and concentrations of <b>iodide,</b> natural organic matter(NOM) and manganese oxide. Methyl <b>iodide</b> was formed at concentrations ≤ 1 μg L- 1 for initial <b>iodide</b> concentrations ranging from 0. 8 to 38. 0 mg L- 1. The production of methyl <b>iodide</b> increased with increasing initial concentrations of <b>iodide</b> ion and Mn sand and when pH decreased from 7 to 5. The hydrophilic NOM isolate exhibited the lowest yield of methyl <b>iodide</b> whereas hydrophobic NOM isolates such as Suwannee River HPOA fraction produced the highest concentration of methyl <b>iodide.</b> The formation of methyl <b>iodide</b> could take place through the oxidation of NOM on manganese dioxide {{in the presence of}} <b>iodide.</b> However, the implication of elemental iodine cannot be excluded at acidic pH. Manganese oxides can then participate with ferric oxides to the formation of methyl <b>iodide</b> in soils and sediments. The formation of methyl <b>iodide</b> is unlikely in technical systems such as drinking water treatment i. e. for ppt levels of <b>iodide</b> and low contact times with manganese oxides...|$|R

When they were grown in a liquid medium containing 0. 1 μM <b>iodide,</b> 79 to 89 % of the <b>iodide</b> {{was removed from}} the medium, and a corresponding amount of <b>iodide</b> was detected in the cells. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16 S rRNA gene sequences indicated that iodide-accumulating bacteria were closely related to Flexibacter aggregans NBRC 15975 and Arenibacter troitsensis, members of the family Flavobacteriaceae. When one of the strains, strain C- 21, was cultured with 0. 1 μM <b>iodide,</b> the maximum <b>iodide</b> content and the maximum concentration factor for <b>iodide</b> were 220 ± 3. 6 (mean ± standard deviation) pmol of <b>iodide</b> per mg of dry cells and 5. 5 × 103, respectively.

5|$|Actinides easily {{react with}} halogens forming salts with the {{formulas}} MX3 and MX4 (X = halogen). So the first berkelium compound, BkCl3, was synthesized in 1962 with {{an amount of}} 3 nanograms. Like the halogens of rare earth elements, actinide chlorides, bromides, and <b>iodides</b> are water-soluble, and fluorides are insoluble. Uranium easily yields a colorless hexafluoride, which sublimates at a temperature of 56.5°C; because of its volatility, it {{is used in the}} separation of uranium isotopes with gas centrifuge or gaseous diffusion. Actinide hexafluorides have properties close to anhydrides. They are very sensitive to moisture and hydrolyze forming AnO2F2. The pentachloride and black hexachloride of uranium were synthesized, but they are both unstable.|$|E
5|$|Iodous {{acid and}} iodite are even less stable and exist {{only as a}} {{fleeting}} intermediate in the oxidation of iodide to iodate, if at all. Iodates {{are by far the}} most important of these compounds, which can be made by oxidising alkali metal <b>iodides</b> with oxygen at 600°C and high pressure, or by oxidising iodine with chlorates. Unlike chlorates, which disproportionate very slowly to form chloride and perchlorate, iodates are stable to disproportionation in both acidic and alkaline solutions. From these, salts of most metals can be obtained. Iodic acid is most easily made by oxidation of an aqueous iodine suspension by electrolysis or fuming nitric acid. Iodate has the weakest oxidising power of the halates, but reacts the quickest.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The acute {{decrease}} in <b>iodide</b> organification in the thyroid {{in response to}} excess <b>iodide</b> is termed the acute Wolff–Chaikoff effect and normal organification resumes in spite of continued high plasma <b>iodide</b> concentrations (escape from the acute Wolff–Chaikoff effect). We have recently reported that large doses of <b>iodide</b> given to rats chronically decrease the sodium/iodide symporter (NIS) mRNA and protein, suggesting that escape {{is due to a}} {{decrease in}} NIS and subsequent <b>iodide</b> transport. We have now studied the effect of excess <b>iodide</b> on NIS in FRTL- 5 cells to further explore the mechanisms whereby excess <b>iodide</b> decreases NIS. Design: FRTL- 5 cells were employed and were incubated in {{the presence or absence of}} various concentrations of <b>iodide.</b> NIS mRNA and protein and the turnover of NIS were assessed.

5|$|All four thorium tetrahalides are known, as {{are some}} low-valent {{bromides}} and iodides: the tetrahalides are all 8-coordinated hygroscopic compounds that dissolve easily in polar solvents such as water. Many related polyhalide ions are also known. Thorium tetrafluoride has a monoclinic crystal structure {{like those of}} zirconium tetrafluoride and hafnium tetrafluoride, where the Th4+ ions are coordinated with F− ions in somewhat distorted square antiprisms. The other tetrahalides instead have dodecahedral geometry. Lower <b>iodides</b> ThI3 (black) and ThI2 (gold) can also be prepared by reducing the tetraiodide with thorium metal: they do not contain Th(III) and Th(II), but instead contain Th4+ and could be more clearly formulated as electride compounds. Many polynary halides with the alkali metals, barium, thallium, and ammonium are known for thorium fluorides, chlorides, and bromides.

Thyroid hormone biosynthesis requires <b>iodide</b> uptake into the thyrocytes and efflux into the follicular lumen, where it is organified on selected tyrosyls of thyroglobulin.

NIS is expressed in the thyroid, the salivary glands, gastric mucosa, and the lactating mammary gland.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of thyroid metabolism by <b>iodide</b> involves numerous inhibitory effects. However, in unstimulated dog thyroid slices, a small inconstant stimulatory effect of <b>iodide</b> on H(2) O(2) generation is observed. The only other stimulatory effect reported with <b>iodide</b> is on [1 -(14) C]glucose oxidation, i. e. on the pentose phosphate pathway. Because we have recently {{demonstrated that the}} pentose phosphate pathway is controlled by H(2) O(2) generation, we study here the effect of <b>iodide</b> on basal H(2) O(2) generation in thyroid slices from several species. Our data show that in sheep, pig, bovine, {{and to a lesser}} extent dog thyroid, <b>iodide</b> had a stimulatory effect on H(2) O(2) generation. In horse and human thyroid, an inconstant effect was observed. We demonstrate in dogs that the stimulatory effect of <b>iodide</b> is greater in thyroids deprived of <b>iodide,</b> raising the possibility that differences in thyroid <b>iodide</b> pool may account, at least in part, for the differences between the different species studied. This represents the first demonstration of an activation by <b>iodide</b> of a specialized thyroid function. In comparison with conditions in which an inhibitory effect of <b>iodide</b> on H(2) O(2) generation is observed, the stimulating effect was observed for lower concentrations and for a shorter incubation time with <b>iodide.</b> Such a dual control of H(2) O(2) generation by <b>iodide</b> has the physiological interest of promoting an efficient oxidation of <b>iodide</b> when the substrate is provided to a deficient gland and of avoiding excessive oxidation of <b>iodide</b> and thus synthesis of thyroid hormones when it is in excess.
