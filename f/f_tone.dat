In the present study, 4 -kHz carrier was modulated by <b>tones</b> <b>f</b> 1 and f 2 to produce the difference <b>tone</b> <b>f</b> 3 = f 2 f 1 in the amplitude modulation domain. Detection thresholds for canceling <b>tone</b> <b>f</b> 3 were obtained for subjects with normal-hearing and hearing-impaired sub-jects. In three experimental conditions, monaural and binaural presentation of tones was used to test possible central origin of the nonlinearity in modulation domain.

30|$|The {{effect of}} RF {{non-linearities}} can be clearly seen in Figure 4 d, where we present {{the spectrum of}} the received self-interference signal when transmitting with an output power of 20 dBm. We observe that strong third and fifth harmonics of the transmitted <b>tone</b> <b>f</b> appear (indicated by (vi) and (vii), respectively). The power of the tones on the negative frequencies {{with respect to the}} main <b>tone</b> <b>f</b> remains almost unaffected, as expected because they do not arise from the RF non-linearities, but from the DAC non-linearities. The third and fifth harmonics of the tones on the negative frequencies lie below the noise floor. We also observe that the noise floor has increased by 20 dB. This is caused by the effect of the limited dynamic range of the ADCs of the receiver, which means that quantisation noise dominates thermal noise. As can be seen by referring to the power budget in Figure 1, we would require at least 20 dB more passive or active analog suppression in order to observe the thermal noise floor.|$|R

In the experiment, the task of subject was to regulate the fundamental frequency (<b>F</b> 0) of <b>tone</b> by his/her {{thumb and index finger}} pressing a force sensor. The F 0 was 523. 25 Hz（C 5 ）when the measured force was 5 N, and was changed 100 cents up if the force increased 1 N. While the subject regulated and kept a target F 0 at 466. 16 ， 523. 25 or 587. 33 Hz (Bb 4 ， C 5 or D 5), the <b>tone</b> <b>F</b> 0 was unexpectedly shifted upward or downward by 100 cents. The compensatory change of finger force for the F 0 shifts was measured. As results, the compensatory response with latency of 150 ~ 300 ms was observed.

40|$|When {{presented}} with alternating {{low and high}} tones, listeners {{are more likely to}} perceive 2 separate streams of tones (“streaming”) than a single coherent stream when the frequency separation (<b>ƒ)</b> between <b>tones</b> is greater and the number of tone presentations is greater (“buildup”). However, the same large-ƒ sequence reduces streaming for subsequent patterns presented after a gap of up to several seconds. Buildup occurs at a level of neural representation with sharp frequency tuning. The authors used adaptation to demonstrate that the contextual effect of prior ƒ arose from a representation with broad frequency tuning, unlike buildup. Separate adaptation did not occur in a representation of ƒ independent of frequency range, suggesting that any frequency-shift detectors undergoing adaptation are also frequency specific. A separate effect of prior perception was observed, dissociating stimulus-related (i. e., ƒ) and perception-related (i. e., 1 stream vs. 2 streams) adaptation. Viewing a visual analogue to auditory streaming had no effect on subsequent perception of streaming, suggesting adaptation in auditory-specific brain circuits. These results, along with previous findings on buildup, suggest that processing in at least 3 levels of auditory neural representation underlies segregation and formation of auditory streams...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{systematically}} manipulated three acoustic cues-fundamental frequency (f 0), amplitude envelope, and duration-to investigate {{their contributions to}} tonal contrasts in Mandarin. Simplified stimuli with all possible combinations of these three cues were presented for identification to eight normal-hearing listeners, all native speakers of Mandarin from Taiwan. The f 0 information was conveyed either by an f 0 -controlled sawtooth carrier or a modulated noise so as to compare the performance achievable by {{a clear indication of}} voice f 0 and what is possible with purely temporal coding of <b>f</b> 0. <b>Tone</b> recognition performance with explicit f 0 was much better than that with any combination of other acoustic cues (consistently greater than 90 % correct compared to 33 %- 65 %; chance is 25 %). In the absence of explicit f 0, the temporal coding of f 0 and amplitude envelope both contributed somewhat to tone recognition, while duration had only a marginal effect. Performance based on these secondary cues varied greatly across listeners. These results explain the relatively poor perception of tone in cochlear implant users, given that cochlear implants currently provide only weak cues to f 0, so that users must rely upon the purely temporal (and secondary) features for the perception of tone.

The {{peaks of the}} ripples, or local DPOAE amplitude maxima, are separated by approximately half octave intervals and are accompanied by phase oscillations. The local maxima appear at the same frequencies in DPOAEs of different order and velocity responses of the stapes and do not shift with increasing levels of the primaries. A suppressor tone {{had little effect on}} the frequencies of the maxima, but partially suppressed DPOAE amplitude when it was placed close to the f 2 frequencies. These findings agree with earlier observations that the maxima occur at the same DPOAE frequencies, which are independent of the f 2 and the primary ratio, and thus are likely to be associated with DPOAE propagation mechanisms. Furthermore, the separation of the local maxima by approximately half an octave may suggest that the maxima are due to interference of the travelling waves along the basilar membrane at the frequency of the DPOAE. It is suggested that the rippling pattern appears because of interaction between DPOAE reverse travelling waves with standing waves formed in the cochlea...|$|R

Their acoustic behavior is relevant for individual identification, mating and parental care. Manatees produce tonal sounds with highest {{energy in the}} second harmonic (usually 5  kHz), and their audiogram indicates sensitivity from 0. 3  kHz to 90  kHz with lowest thresholds in the 16 to 18  kHz range. We recorded manatees in the San San River, a highly polluted riverine system in Panama, using a stereo array. Frequency transmission experiments were conducted in four subhabitats, categorized using riverine vegetation. Incidental interactions of manatees and small motorboats were examined. Acoustic transmission was linearly related to tonal vocalization characters: correlations were stronger in freshwater than in transition and marine environments. Two bands, 0. 6 to 2  kHz and 3 to 8  kHz, attenuate similarly in all subhabitats, and these bands encompass <b>F</b> 0 (<b>tone)</b> and peak frequency respectively of manatee tonal calls. Based on our data we conclude that frequency transmission depends mainly on river depth and bottom characteristics, also motorboat sounds mask signals from 3. 5  kHz to 8  kHz, which overlaps the peak frequency of tonal calls.

Later MDS studies on tonal perception in three varieties of Mandarin, namely Beijing, Rugao, and Yantai, also revealed perceptual proximity for lexical tones linked by sandhi rules (Johnson, 2004; Huang, 2004). Following the assumption that tones linked by sandhi rules are closer in perceptual distance, it is proposed that Taiwanese lexical tones would be perceptually similar as well due to chain sandhi rules, HH and LH-> MM-> ML-> HL-> HH.
