40|$|Escalating {{demands for}} high {{performance}} wireless systems requires {{the confluence of}} smart communication methods, network protocols and ongoing advances in fabrication technologies, {{in order to bring}} smaller form factor mobile handsets to market. On par with these trends, this thesis focuses on two main areas, namely, Multiple Antenna Systems and Adaptive MAC Design to improve wireless system performance. The first part of this research work presents a mathematical framework for characterizing the performance of cellular mobile radio systems equipped with smart antennas at the mobile handset to suppress a few dominant cochannel interferers (CCI) {{out of a total of}} L active independent but non-identically distributed Rayleigh faded CCI signals. Earlier works on this subject chose an unrealistic i. i. d assumption for the cochannel interferers. Since the CCI signals are of <b>dissimilar</b> <b>signal</b> strengths in practical operating environments, the premise of i. n. d fading statistics for the cochannel interferers is more realistic. In the subsequent section an analytical framework to investigate the benefits of a hybrid antenna array using selective interference nulling (SIN) and maximal rati...|$|E
40|$|Forty {{young and}} 40 older adults {{completed}} a verbal and non-verbal recognition task {{to determine whether}} there were age differences in recognition memory for three factors. The between-group factors included the age of the participant (young vs. older) and the mode of stimulus presentation (one-alternative, forced choice vs. two-alternative, forced choice). The within-group factors were the type of stimulus (words vs. shapes) and the level of trial difficulty, as indicated by the degree of target-distractor similarity (similar vs. <b>dissimilar).</b> <b>Signal</b> detection analyses indicated that recognition accuracy declined with age. Older adults showed consistently poorer recognition than their younger counterparts. In contrast to the pictorial superiority effect, recognition accuracy was impaired across the lifespan for non-verbal as opposed to verbal stimuli. In accordance with previous studies, items that were high in target-distractor similarity were recognised at lower rates than items that were low in target-distractor similarity. When the two-alternative, forced choice data were transformed to d' and adjusted for comparison with the one-alternative, forced choice data, the effect of Presentation Mode disappeared. This result is in accordance with the predictions of signal detection theory. In addition to the main effects, a significant Stimulus Type x Trial Difficulty x Presentation Mode, and Presentation Mode x Age interaction emerged, which qualified the interpretation of the main effects...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, novel {{designs for}} {{adaptive}} power amplifiers, capable of maintaining excellent performance at <b>dissimilar</b> <b>signal</b> parameters, are presented. These designs result in electronically reconfigurable, single-ended and Doherty power amplifiers (DPA) that efficiently sustain functionality at different driving signal levels, highly varying time domain characteristics and wide-spread frequency bands. The foregoing three contexts represent those {{dictated by the}} diverse standards of modern communication systems. Firstly, two prototypes for a harmonically-tuned reconfigurable matching network using discrete radio frequency (RF) microelectromechanical systems (MEMS) switches and semiconductor varactors will be introduced. Following that is an explanation of how the varactor-based matching network was used to develop a high performance reconfigurable Class F- 1 power amplifier. Afterwards, a systematic design procedure for realizing an electronically reconfigurable DPA capable of operating at arbitrary centre frequencies, average power levels and back-off efficiency enhancement power ranges is presented. Complete sets of closed-form equations are outlined which were used to build tunable matching networks that compensate for the deviation of the Doherty distributed elements under the desired deployment scenarios. Off-the-shelf RF MEMS switches are used to realize the reconfigurability of the adaptive Doherty amplifiers. Finally, based on the derived closed-form equations, a tri-band, monolithically integrated DPA was realized using the Canadian Photonics Fabrication Centre (CPFC®) GaN 500 {{monolithic microwave integrated circuit}} (MMIC) process. Successful integration of high power, high performance RF MEMS switches within the MMIC process {{paved the way for the}} realization of the frequency-agile, integrated version of the adaptive Doherty amplifier...|$|E

40|$|Mitochondrial {{targeting}} signals (MTSs) {{are responsible}} for trafficking nuclear encoded proteins to their final destination within mitochondria. These sequences are diverse, sharing little amino acid homology and vary significantly in length, and although {{the formation of a}} positively-charged amphiphilic alpha helix within the MTS is considered to be necessary and sufficient to mediate import, such a feature does not explain their diversity, nor how such diversity influences target sequence function, nor how such <b>dissimilar</b> <b>signals</b> interact with a single, evolutionarily conserved import mechanism. An in silico analysis of 296 N-terminal, matrix destined MTSs from Homo sapiens, Mus musculus, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Arabidopsis thaliana, and Oryza sativa was undertaken to investigate relationships between MTSs, and/or, relationships between an individual targeting signal sequence and the protein that it imports. We present evidence that suggests MTS diversity is influenced in part by physiochemical and N-terminal characteristics of their mature sequences, and that some of these correlated characteristics are evolutionarily maintained across a number of taxa. Importantly, some of these associations begin to explain the variation in MTS length and composition...|$|R
40|$|Chemokine receptors of {{both the}} CC and CXC {{families}} have been demonstrated to undergo a ligand-mediated homodimerization process required for Ca 2 + flux and chemotaxis. We show that, in the chemokine response, heterodimerization is also permitted between given receptor pairs, specifically between CCR 2 and CCR 5. This has functional consequences, as the CCR 2 and CCR 5 ligands monocyte chemotactic protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and RANTES (regulated upon activation, normal T cell-expressed and secreted) cooperate to trigger calcium responses at concentrations 10 - to 100 -fold lower than the threshold for either chemokine alone. Heterodimerization results in recruitment of each receptor-associated signaling complex, but also recruits <b>dissimilar</b> <b>signaling</b> path ways such as Gq/ 11 association, and delays activation of phosphatidyl inositol 3 -kinase. The consequences are a pertussis toxin-resistant Ca 2 + flux and trig gering of cell adhesion rather than chemotaxis. These results show the effect of heterodimer formation on increasing the sensitivity and dynamic range of the chemokine response, and may aid in understanding the dynamics of leukocytes at limiting chemokine concentrations in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Introduction of {{fly-by-wire}} {{and increasing}} levels of automation significantly improve {{the safety of}} civil aircraft, and result in advanced capabilities for detecting, protecting and optimizing A/C guidance and control. However, this higher complexity requires the availability of some key flight parameters to be extended. Hence, the monitoring and consolidation of those signals is a significant issue, usually achieved via many functionally redundant sensors to extend the way those parameters are measured. This solution penalizes the overall system performance in terms of weight, maintenance, and so on. Other alternatives rely on signal processing or model-based techniques that make a global use of {{all or part of}} the sensor data available, supplemented by a model-based simulation of the flight mechanics. That processing achieves real-time estimates of the critical parameters and yields <b>dissimilar</b> <b>signals.</b> Filtered and consolidated information is delivered in unfaulty conditions by estimating an extended state vector, including wind components, and can replace failed signals in degraded conditions.

Maximal activation was achieved after 5 min. Thereafter, MAPK activity stimulated by ET- 1 or aFGF declined to control values within 1 - 2 h, whereas activation by TPA was more sustained. Two peaks of MAPK activity (a 42 - and a 44 -kDa MAPK) were resolved in cells exposed to ET- 1 or aFGF by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q column. One major and one minor peak of MAPK kinase (MAPKK) was stimulated by ET- 1 or aFGF. Cardiac myocytes expressed protein kinase C (PKC) -alpha, -delta, -epsilon and -zeta as shown immunoblotting. Exposure to 1 microM TPA for 24 h down-regulated PKC-alpha, -delta, and -epsilon, but not PKC-zeta. This maneuver wholly abolished the activation of MAPK on re-exposure to TPA {{but did not}} affect the response to aFGF. The effect of ET- 1 was partially down-regulated. ET- 1 stimulated phospho[3 H]inositide hydrolysis 18 -fold, whereas aFGF stimulated by only 30 %. Agonists which initially utilize <b>dissimilar</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways may therefore converge at the level of MAPKK/MAPK and this may be relevant to the hypertrophic response of the heart...|$|R

40|$|New, simple yet very {{accurate}} closed-form expressions for calcu-lating the symbol error probability (SER) of multilevel quadrature amplitude modulation (MQAM) {{in conjunction with}} L-fold antenna diversity on a Nakagami fading channel are presented. Both maximal-ratio (MRC) and equal-gain (EGC) predetection diversity combining techniques have been considered. The exact closed-form formula for MRC diversity system removes the limita-tions of previous studies in the literature which have been limited to Rayleigh fading. Moreover, an exact analysis of EGC for MQAM has not been reported previously despite its practical interest. The exact SER is expressed as a finite-range integral. Our unified expressions are sufficiently general to handle arbitrary fad-ing parameters as well as <b>dissimilar</b> mean <b>signal</b> strengths across the diversity branches.

40|$|African weakly-electric fishes (Mormyridae) {{are able}} to {{communicate}} through species-specific electric signals; this feature might have favoured the evolutionary radiation observed in this family (over 200 species) by acting as an effective pre-zygotic isolation mechanism. In the present study we used mitochondrial (cytb) and nuclear (rps 7, scn 4 aa) markers in order to reconstruct a species-phylogeny and identify species boundaries for the genus Campylomormyrus, by applying inference methods based on the multispecies coalescent model. Additionally, we employed 16 microsatellite markers, landmark-based morphometric measurements, and electro-physiological analyses as independent lines of evidence to the results obtained from the sequence data. The results show that groups that are morphologically different are also significantly divergent at the genetic level, whereas morphologically similar groups, displaying <b>dissimilar</b> electric <b>signals,</b> do not show enough genetic diversity to be considered separate species. Furthermore, the data confirm {{the presence of a}} yet undescribed species within the genus Campylomormyrus...|$|R

40|$|Leaflet {{movements}} in the mimosa-family tree Samanea saman stem from coordinated volume changes of cells in the leaf motor organs in the adaxial and abaxial motor cells (“flexors” and “extensors”). Shrinking, initiated by <b>dissimilar</b> light <b>signals</b> in extensors and in flexors, depends in both cell types on K+ efflux via depolarization-dependent potassium (KD) channels. To compare between flexor and extensor KD channels and to test for a possible interaction of these channels with the Ca 2 +-mobilizing phosphoinositide cascade evoked in these motor cells by the “shrinking signals,” we probed the channels with varying (5 nm– 3 mm) cytosolic free-Ca 2 + concentration ([Ca 2 +]cyt) in patch-clamped inside-out excised membrane patches. Ca 2 + was not required for KD channel activation. [Ca 2 +]cyt of 600 nm decreased {{the mean number of}} open KD channels in flexors, as monitored at − 30 mV. Detailed analysis revealed that in flexors millimolar [Ca 2 +]cyt decreased the maximum number of open channels, but simultaneously increased KD channel opening probability by negatively shifting the half-maximum-activation voltage by 40 to 50 mV. Thus, the promoting and the inhibitory effects at millimolar [Ca 2 +]cyt practically cancelled-out. In contrast to flexors, none of the gating parameters of the extensor KD channels were affected by [Ca 2 +]cyt. Irrespective of [Ca 2 +]cyt, the steady-state gating of extensor KD channels was slightly but significantly more voltage sensitive than that of flexors. The unitary conductances of flexor and extensor KD channels were similar and decreased by approximately 20 % at millimolar [Ca 2 +]cyt. It is intriguing that the extensor KD channels were significantly less K+ selective than those in flexors...|$|R
40|$|Time-frequency {{representations}} (TFRs) {{are powerful}} tools for signal analysis and thus {{widely used in}} signal processing. It is well known, however, {{that there is no}} single TFR which is "the best" for all problems. It is still an unsolved problem how to determine the optimum TFR for a given signal class and analysis task. In this article we develop a new theory of optimum TFRs for classification and detection problems, where two (or more) classes are to be discriminated from one another. Usually this is performed by mapping the signals into some representation space (e. g. a feature space) where a distinction is easily possible. If we regard TFRs as representations in time-frequency space we have to look for TFRs where all signals of one class are similar to each other but <b>dissimilar</b> to all <b>signals</b> of other classes.

40|$|In recent years, {{there is}} an {{enormous}} growth in high speed wireless users. Multipath propagation is the transmission of wireless signals from the sender to the receiver through different paths. And these paths are of dissimilar lengths and this result in <b>dissimilar</b> versions of <b>signals</b> reaching at the receiver at dissimilar times. This results in inter-symbol interference by spreading to nearby symbols. Time Reversal Division Multiple Access (TRDMA) is a wireless channel access method which is both energy efficient and low complex is discussed in this paper. TRDMA uses multipath effect to solve the cumbersome issue of inter-symbol interference (ISI). In this technique, energy is concentrated in both spatial and temporal domains. Thus, effective utilization of energy can be made. Multiple user downlink system uses the time reversal structure, where signals from different users are separated by TRDMA. Single transmit antenna with multiple users having single receiving antenna (SISO), Multiple transmit antennas with multiple users having single receiving antenna (MISO) are developed and evaluated. System performance is investigated in terms of achievable sum rate and with outage probability for MISO case. Satisfactory results were obtained through simulation. The simulation for TRDMA was carried out using Matlab software...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{factors that}} {{influence}} stratigraphy are tectonic subsidence, eustasy, and sediment supply. Change {{in any of these}} factors potentially produces a similar response {{in the form of a}} change in accommodation space. Accordingly, distinguishing the origin of a stratigraphic response is difficult, but theoretically possible by analysis of temporal and spatial extents of the accommodation signal. Correlation is critical for distinguishing eustasy from tectonism. Upper Pennsylvanian strata of the Pedregosa and Orogrande basins (southern Ancestral Rocky Mountains) were deposited during a time of continental collision and extensive continental glaciation, and contain a composite record of changing tectonism, eustasy, climate, and sediment supply. High-frequency stratigraphic cyclicity expressed as repetitive stacks of lithofacies at the scale of 10 ¹ m pervades all sections and displays features that collectively imply a primary glacioeustatic origin, notably: (1) abrupt juxtaposition of <b>dissimilar</b> lithofacies, <b>signaling</b> a rapid rate of baselevel change, (2) apparent intrabasinal, interbasinal and, provisionally, interregional correlation of high-frequency cycles across and between contrasting tectonic environments, and (3) cycle frequencies that approach the 413 ka periodicity of orbital eccentricity, the probable forcing mechanism for Pennsylvanian glaciations. Glacial-interglacial climate change expressed as precipitation and circulation fluctuations in the equatorial Pedregosa and Orogrande basins accompanied Pennsylvanian glacioeustasy. Intensified aridity and wind strength during peak glacials led to decreased fluvio-deltaic sedimentation and increased eolian activity where siliciclastics were available. Conversely, increased precipitation during interglacials reactivated and/or intensified fluvio-deltaic sediment yield. Eustasy dictated fluvial aggradation versus degradation and coastal sediment trapping versus bypassing. Coupled glacioeustatic-glacioclimatic change was sufficiently severe to reconfigure environments between climatic extremes, which implies that Pennsylvanian stratigraphic cycles should be viewed in at least partially non-Waltherian terms. Each cycle potentially recorded contrasting facies mosaics that were to some degree temporally exclusive. Multiple-cycle trends in facies and/or thickness also occur to define low-frequency stratigraphic patterns at the scale of 10 ² m. Qualitative analysis of these trends implicates distinct eustatic and tectonic processes as contributing influences. The eustatic component may derive from low-frequency glacioeustasy as well as tectonoeustasy related to evolving continental paleogeography. The tectonic component probably reflects late Paleozoic Marathon-Ouachita collisional orogenesis...|$|R
