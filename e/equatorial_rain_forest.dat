50|$|The tributaries of River Kasai {{are clear}} of {{obstacles}} like cataracts and river weed, making them very navigable. They facilitate {{the transport sector}} and form an important trade artery. The river’s role in transport and trade was more prominent during the pre-colonial period when slave trade was legal. Slave traders used one of its major tributaries, the Kwango River, to navigate the <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest,</b> capture slaves and find {{their way back to}} the Atlantic Ocean where they had docked their ships.It is greatly controversial that some of the local kingdoms that lived along the Kasai River supported slave trade. The Rund kingdom for instance, readily provided slaves for most notorious slave traders like John Matthews, a renowned British slave vendor. These activities, though they occurred between 18th and 19th centuries, left a lasting impact in the regions where they were most prominent, like between Kwango and Kwilu rivers. The population has never recovered fully, with the population density lower than that of areas that did not experience slave trade.The most probable trigger to British and Portuguese great interests in the Kasai River is the presence of alluvial diamonds lying in rich deposit beds, especially at the river’s mouth. More deposits lie along the beds of its major tributary, the Kwango River. In fact, it is common to hear the phrase “the diamond heartland of North Eastern Angola” used in reference to the Kwango River valley. This is because the diamond alluvial beds found in this region are the richest in Angola.|$|E

40|$|Ecologically {{important}} ectomycorrhizal (EM) {{associations are}} poorly known from <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forests</b> of South America. Recent field {{studies in the}} Pakaraima Mountains of western Guyana revealed previously undocumented forests dominated by EM leguminous trees, with a rich assemblage of EM mycobionts. Along transects, basidiomes from 75 species or morphospecies of putatively EM fungi were spatially associated with leguminous host trees. These fungi belonged to the basidiomycete families Boletaceae, Amanitaceae, Russulaceae, Cortinariaceae, Cantharellaceae, Clavulinaceae, and Entolomataceae, {{all of which are}} poorly documented from the lowland neotropics. Ectomycorrhizas were confirmed on D. corymbosa, D. altsonii, and D. jenmanii (Caesalpiniaceae, tribe Amherstieae), and a fourth species, Aldina insignis (Papilionaceae). The tribe Amherstieae contains most of the EM leguminous species forming monodominant forests in Guineo-Congolian Africa. Dicymbe species constituted the first record of EM Amherstieae in the New World. A variety of other co-occurring caesalpiniaceous trees failed to exhibit ectomycorrhizas. Transect surveys indicated that D. corymbosa and D. altsonii were: (1) highly clumped and dominant at specific sites; (2) occurred on soils with widely varying chemical and textural characteristics; and (3) the most important hosts for EM fungi in the local landscape. Dicymbe species have life history attributes, including the ectomycorrhizal habit, which enhance their competitive abilities irrespective of soil conditions. The spatial restriction of EM fungal basidiomes indicated that discrete groves of EM trees harbour an important component of regional macromycete diversity...|$|R
5000|$|Tillandsia is a genus {{of around}} 650 species of evergreen, {{perennial}} flowering {{plants in the}} family Bromeliaceae, native to the forests, mountains and deserts of Central and South America, the southern United States and the West Indies. They have naturally been established in diverse environments such as <b>equatorial</b> tropical <b>rain</b> <b>forests,</b> high elevation Andes mountains, rock dwelling (saxicolous) regions, and Louisiana swamps, such as Spanish Moss (T. usneoides), a species that grows atop tree limbs. Airplant is a common name for plants in this genus. [...] Most Tillandsia species are epiphytes - i.e. they normally grow without soil while attached to other plants. Some are aerophytes or air plants, which have no roots and grow on shifting desert soil. Generally, the thinner-leafed varieties grow in rainy areas and the thick-leafed varieties in areas more subject to drought. Most species absorb moisture and nutrients through the leaves from rain, dew, dust, decaying leaves and insect matter, aided by structures called trichomes.|$|R

To {{begin to understand the}} diversity of the HIV- 1 group M subtypes infecting persons living in rural villages in the <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> regions of Cameroon, 49 plasma samples from 14 rural villages in four provinces of Cameroon were analyzed using heteroduplex mobility analysis (HMA), DNA sequencing, and phylogenetic tree analysis on the basis of env C 2 V 5, gag, or pol regions. Sixty-one percent of the group M infections were clade A or CRF 02 _AG-like as subtyped by env and gag. Of the remaining group M infections, 12 % were either A or CRF 02 _AG-like or CRF 01 _AE-like in recombination with other clades; 25 % were infections that were entirely non-A or non-CRF 02 _AG-like; and 2 % were CRF 11 _cpx. The HIV- 1 group M clades identified included A, D, F (F 2), G, and H. The CRF strains identified were CRF 02 _AG-like, CRF 01 _AE-like, and CRF 11 _cpx. Two new intersubtype recombinant infections, H/G and A/F 2, were identified. This study suggests that the HIV- 1 diversity in rural villages in the <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> of Cameroon is at least as broad as has been observed in major cities of Cameroon and that multiple HIV- 1 group M subtypes are infecting persons living in the countryside of Cameroon...|$|E

40|$|In {{the region}} of Daloa, Ivory Coast, several Iroko trees (Chlorophora excelsa, family of the Moraceae), a fre-quent species of the <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> known for its {{calcareous}} excretions always related to wounds kept unhealed by insect activity, show an unusual lithogenetic aspect of this process. Between severely damaged roots, large-scale bleeding of the sap, after unsuccessful attempts to build crusts of fibrous carbonate over the wounds, has penetrated into the interstitial spaces of the adjacent granitic residual sand and cemented it by precipitation of calcium carbonate into large blocks of hard and massive calcite-cemented pure-quartz sandstone. The quartz and rare feldspar grains displayed a high amount of marginal corrosion by the cryptocrystalllne calcite cement. The agents responsible for the severe damage to the trees cannot be determined with certainty but are as-sumed to be elephants, wild boars or jungle buffaloes. This recent sandstone demonstrates processes of intense corrosion of detrital quartz and feldspar grains and of general cementation both by calcite which have takeu place {{at or near the}} surface before any decay, burial, overburden or compactlon could occur and which, there-fore, should be considered as geologically instantaneous...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} evapotranspiration {{data for}} three wet and two seasonally dry rain forest sites in Amazonia. The main environmental (net radiation, vapor pressure deficit, and aerodynamic conductance) and vegetation (surface conductance) controls of evapotranspiration are also assessed. Our research supports earlier studies that demonstrate that evapotranspiration {{in the dry}} season is higher than that in the wet season and that surface net radiation is the main controller of evapotranspiration in wet equatorial sites. However, our analyses also indicate that there are different factors controlling the seasonality of evapotranspiration in wet <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> sites and southern seasonally dry rain forests. While the seasonality of evapotranspiration in wet equatorial forests is driven solely by environmental factors, in seasonally dry forests, it is also biotically controlled with the surface conductance varying between seasons {{by a factor of}} approximately 2. The identification of these different drivers of evapotranspiration is a major step forward in our understanding of the water dynamics of tropical forests and has significant implications for the future development of vegetation-atmosphere models and land use and conservation planning in the region.

40|$|Fifty {{measurements}} of nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC) {{and several other}} trace gases were made over an <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> in February 1988 {{as part of the}} DECAFE experiment. The measurements were made independently by two different laboratories. Each laboratory used its own sample containers, gas chromatographic measurement procedure, and calibration. Also, the altitudinal distribution of the samples differed. Apart from propene and i‐pentane for which a substantial difference in the absolute calibration existed between the two laboratories, the average results were very similar, and the vertical profiles were identical within the scatter of the data. For NMHC with longer atmospheric residence times (e. g., ethane and acetylene) the average results agreed within a few percent. In the boundary layer, only small gradients could be found. In all cases where a significant vertical gradient existed, there was an increase of the mixing ratios with increasing altitude. This {{can be explained by the}} different origin of the air masses at different altitudes. Above the boundary the trace gas mixing ratios decrease. The observed NMHC pattern can primarily be described as photochemically aged emissions from biomass burning. The observed depletion of the photochemically reactive NMHC also agrees with the occurrence of enhanced ozone levels in the boundary layer...|$|E

40|$|Aim To explore {{successional}} processes {{associated with}} <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> expansion in Eucalyptus-dominated woodland savanna vegetation in north-eastern Australia. Location Iron Range National Park and environs, northeast Queensland, Australia. This remote region supports probably the largest extent of lowland (< 300 m) rainforest remnant in Australia. Rainfall (c. 1700 mm p. a.) occurs mostly between November and June, with some rain typically occurring {{even in the}} driest months July-October. Methods (1) Sampling of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling distributions, and other vegetation structural attributes, in fifteen 10 x 10 m quadrats distributed equi-distantly between mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins (range: 70 - 840 m), at each of 10 sites which were open-canopied vegetation in 1943. (2) Assessment of relationships between <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling densities and structural characteristics, including distance-to-rain forest-margin, canopy height, stem density. (3) Assessment of lifeform and dispersal spectra for defined vegetation structural types. Results Rates of <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> invasion {{were found to be}} substrate-mediated. Transects established on hematite schist, diorite, riverine alluvium, and granite developed closed canopies (termed phase III sites) by 1991. The remainder (four transects on poorly drained colluvial/alluvial sediments; one on dune sands) continued to occur either as grassy woodland (phase I), or with developing <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> understoreys (phase II). <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedlings were observed at maximum sampled distances from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins at all sites. Lifeform and dispersal spectra data illustrated that: (1) the proportions of woodland trees, shrubs and graminoids declined with successional phase, with concomitant increases in <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> primary trees and all other lifeform categories save <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> trees; (2) the proportions of major dispersal syndromes did not vary between successional phases, neither for <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> nor woodland taxa. Main conclusions <b>Rain</b> <b>forest</b> seedling distribution data for phases I and II sites illustrate three successional processes: margin extension - seedling density significantly negatively correlated with distance from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins at two sites; nucleation - seedling densities significantly positively correlated with tall trees at two sites; and irruption - seedling densities at two sites neither correlated with distance from mature <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> margins, nor with measured vegetation structural features. The observation of irruptive <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> regeneration at these sites, combined with decadal-scale <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> canopy development at the five remaining sites, illustrates that under conditions conducive to growth (moisture, substrate), low fire disturbance, and maintenance of diverse dispersal processes (high frugivore richness), <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> can rapidly invade regional landscapes...|$|R

40|$|The Yanomamo Indians are an unacculturated tribe inhabiting the {{tropical}} <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest</b> of northern Brazil and southern Venezuela {{who do not}} use salt in their diet. The group therefore presented an unusual opportunity to study the hormonal regulation of sodium metabolism in a culture with life-long ex-treme restriction of dietary sodium, with parallel observations on blood pressure. Blood pressures increase from the first to second decade but, in contrast to civilized populations, do not systematically increase during subsequent years of life. In twenty-four hour urine collections on adult male Indians, excretion of sodium averaged only 1 ± 1. 5 (SD) mEq. Simultaneous plasma renin activities were elevated and {{comparable to those of}} civilized subjects placed for brief periods on 10 mEq sodium diets. Similarly, excretion rates of aldosterone equaled those of acculturated subjects on low sodium diets. The findings suggest that the hor-monal adjustments to life-long low sodium intakes are similar to those achieved in acute sodium restriction of civilized man. Parenthetically, these elevated levels of aldosterone and renin were probably the norm for man during much of human evolution and suggest that the values observed in civilized controls are depressed by an excessive salt intake in contemporary diets.

40|$|People live in space-time: a space-time {{constructed}} by social relations. The social-relational base of space becomes particularly evident where cultural change has upset {{the environmental and}} kinship connections which established, and are in turn maintained, by the spatial organization which has hitherto existed. In settings of social disruption, ritual offers a site of semiotic possibility. The heightening of oppositional values at the ritual center achieves a densely layered indexicality, creating a zenith at which spatial and social structures may dialectically transform one another, and then be extended back into the lived order of the cosmos. For the Fang who experienced such disruption, living in the <b>Equatorial</b> <b>Rain</b> <b>Forest</b> of Northern and Central Gabon in the late 1950 s, participation in the cult of Bwiti offers a counter-active means of reinvigorating the social relations that undergirded their social and spatial structures.

In ritual spatio-temporal realignment of connections with the ancestors, Fang are able to re-establish the balance of social solidarity in a strongly egalitarian, and increasingly individualistic, social milieu. In doing so, they both incorporate and challenge co-existing perspectives of their lived space, and offer a provocative setting in which to consider the ways that spatial imaginings and re-imaginings may be appropriated in ritual to address social and cultural disruptio...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe Kribi-Campo {{sub-basin}} {{is composed}} of an Early to Mid Cretaceous series from West Africa's Atlantic coast and is located in southern Cameroon in the Central African <b>equatorial</b> <b>rain</b> <b>forest.</b> It is the smallest coastal basin in Cameroon and forms {{the southern part of}} the Douala/Kribi-Campo basin known as Douala basin (s. l.). Until now, no detailed sedimentological studies have been carried out on the outcrops of this basin located in the Campo area. The aim of this study was to characterise the depositional environments, vertical evolution and tectonic context of these Lower Cretaceous series in order to make a comparison with adjacent basins and replace them in the geodynamic context. Facies analysis of the Lower Mundeck Formation (Lower Cretaceous) indicates the presence of four major, interfigered facies associations, that are inferred to represent elements of an alluvial to lacustrine­ fan delta system. The clast lithologies suggest proximity of relief supplying coarse-grained sediment during the deposition of the Lower Mundeck Formation at Campo. The general dip and direction of the bedding is approximately 10 ­ 12 NW, which also corresponds to the orientation of the foliations in the underlying metamorphic basement. The main sedimentary succession is characterised by a major retrogradational/progradational cycle of Late Aptian age, evaluated at about 3 Ma, with a well-developed progradational trend characterised by fluctuations of the recognised depositional environments. Fluctuations in lake level and sediment supply were possibly controlled by active faults at the basin margin, although climatic changes may have also played a role. The consistently W­WNW palaeoflow of sediments suggests that the palaeorelief was located to the east and could be oriented in a NNE­SSW direction, downthrown to the west. Local outcrops dated as Albian, both north and south of the main outcrop, display some marine influence. These deposits are cut by 040 ­ 060 faults parallel to the oceanic transform. Similarly, the Lower Mundeck Formation of the Campo outcrops is considered to be associated mainly with the early drift period of Late Aptian­Albian age. This study is also the first step of knowledge of these African margin deposits, to realise in the future the correlations between outcrops and offshore data...|$|E
