5000|$|Kevin Barnes has fluctuated between writing {{personal}} and fictional lyrics {{over the course}} of his career, in part because negative reviews his first album received deterred him from writing about himself for a period of time.

[...] Andrew Dallmeyer in Herald Scotland (2010) Dallmeyer, described as a veteran actor and playwright, began his theatre work in the 1960s as an actor in Bristol Old Vic and Nottingham Playhouse performances. At the age of 26 he was the artistic director at Liverpool Playhouse, although he didn't enjoy it and instead wanted to focus on writing his own plays. He subsequently directed many productions at the Traverse Theatre in Edinburgh, Sheffield Crucible, Dundee Rep, Leeds Playhouse and several more.|$|E

40|$|Comparing {{writing and}} drawing. As an opening remark it is {{relevant}} {{to point out that}} the static picture plays a fundamental role for all other typologies of pictures. That is why {{it is relevant}} to pay deep attention to it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>write</b> <b>something</b> on a piece of paper or if you draw something on a piece of paper (which both are relatively familiar situations in our culture (the first one more common than the latter)) the two situations apparently look very much like each other. When you write you produce a lot of figures (the letters) on a ground (the paper). When you draw you produce some figures or elements (an elephant, a man, a dog, a balloon, a white horse or what do I know) on a ground (the paper). In both cases the paper keeps its physical form unless you destroy it, which hopefully is an exception. That means apparently, that the edge of the paper is also the edge of the written page and of the drawing. However, you seldom find letters close to all four edges of the paper, because you make margins when you write. This sounds simple to adults, but is it that simple, try to remember the way drawings fill out a piece of paper...|$|E

I dare say <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>wrote</b> <b>something</b> very charming to her it might not be too late. We women are very forgiving, Mr. Demorest, and although she is very much sought after, as are all young American girls whose fathers can give them a comfortable 'dot', her parents might be persuaded to throw over a poor prince for a rich countryman in the end. Of course, you know, to you Republicans there is always something fascinating in titles and blood, and our dear friend is like other girls. Still, it is worth the risk. And five years of waiting and devotion really ought to tell. It's quite a romance! Shall I write to her and tell her I have seen you, looking well and prosperous? Nothing more. Do let me!
