In mobile network there are many factors affecting mobility. It is thus necessary to look after the bandwidth strength, RSS, load balancing and many other vital factors. This paper has explained a very important mechanism of mobile networks which is handoff and its various types. The prediction part and the various existing strategies come into play and have a role in deciding the activities based on user movement. It is immensely important to predict the user movement and keep the resources ready which will be helpful to achieve a seamless handoff.

40|$|This Paper {{analyses}} {{call drop}} in a linear highway mobile system having {{a relatively small}} cell radius and a short signal averaging interval compared to the GSM. Call drop is classified by three components: the <b>delay</b> <b>call</b> drop, the no channel call drop, and the nonoverlapping call drop. The performance improvement schemes, in particular focusing on the call dropout rate, are studied with those classified component's analysis results. Moreover one of performance improvement schemes, the handover rejection scheme, is examined by combining with the channel reservation scheme. 1. INTRODUCTION In this paper we consider {{the effect of a}} short signal averaging interval in handover algorithm on a mobile system in which heavy demands from new calls and handover requests are generated. Particularly the call dropout rate is measured and analysed with the simplified handover and call process model. As the cell radius decreases, the long signal averaging interval should be reconsidered. If the han [...] ...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the authentication and key agreement (AKA) protocol for universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS) mobile networks, where a new protocol is proposed. In our proposed protocol, the mobile station {{is responsible for}} generating of authentication token (AUTN) and random number (RAND). The home location register is responsible for comparison of response and expected response to take a decision. Therefore, the bottleneck at authentication center is avoided by {{reducing the number of}} messages between mobile and authentication center. The authentication time <b>delay,</b> <b>call</b> setup time, and signalling traffic are minimized in the proposed protocol. A fluid mobility model is used to investigate the performance of signalling traffic and load transaction messages between mobile database, such as home location register (HLR) and visitor location register (VLR) for both the current protocol and the proposed protocol. The simulation results show that the authentication delay and current load transaction messages between entities and bandwidth are minimized as compared to current protocol. Therefore, the performance and the authentication delay time have been improved significantly.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — As {{the request}} for {{classified}} confidential data exchange and meetings over telephone and teleconference calls increases, many businesses and governmental organizations have to use calls over the existing phones, assuming that their conversations are not intercepted by intruders. However, since public telephones do not encrypt voice, such existing calls and teleconferences are vulnerable to eavesdropping, causing their information to leak. As a solution, I propose different encryption schemes for secure basic and teleconference calls, which can be put into practice over existing {{public switched telephone network}} (PSTN) with minimum modification of the existing architecture. By exploiting the capabilities of the circuit-switched module of the OPNET software, I show how the key negotiation protocol can be implemented in the signaling system seven (SS 7), connecting the secure equipment to the SS 7 grid to ensure end-to-end privacy. Using the simulation, I show how the adding of secure services affects the quality of service of the SS 7 network (call setup <b>delay,</b> <b>call</b> blocking, and network usage).

40|$|Objective : We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that responses to physiologic deterioration in hospital ward patients delayed by more than 15 minutes are associated with increased mortality. Design, Setting, and Participants: We used data from a 23 -hospital cluster randomized trial (January 2004 to December 2004) of implementation of rapid response teams (intervention) versus standard practice with conventional cardiac arrest team-based responses to emergencies (control). We examined emergency calls in all hospitals. In intervention hospitals, we also examined such calls in the period before, during the introduction, and after the full implementation of a rapid response system. We studied the statistical association between such <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> and mortality. Main Outcomes and Measure: Hospital outcomes (mortality, unplanned ICU admissions, and cardiac arrests). Results: There were 3, 135 emergency team calls in all hospitals. Overall, almost one third of such <b>calls</b> were <b>delayed.</b> In intervention hospitals, the proportion of <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> was similar before and after implementation of rapid response teams. Compared with control hospitals, in intervention hospitals, {{there was a significant}} decrease in the proportion of <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> during both the introduction (27. 3 % vs 34. 3 % weekly rate; incidence rate ratio, 0. 84; p = 0. 001) and the full implementation period (29. 0 % vs 34. 5 % weekly rate; incidence rate ratio, 0. 84; p = 0. 023). <b>Delayed</b> <b>calls</b> more likely occurred at night, in high dependence or coronary care units, in patients older than 75 years, in those with a decrease in Glasgow Coma Scale, or in those with hypotension as the reason for the call. Finally, in all hospitals, <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> were associated with an increased risk of unplanned ICU admissions (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 56; 95 % CI, 1. 23 - 2. 04; p ≤ 0. 001) and death (adjusted odds ratio = 1. 79; 95 % CI, 1. 43 - 2. 27; p < 0. 001). Conclusions: Among ward patients, emergency team activation in response to acute deterioration triggered more than 15 minutes after detection and documentation of instability is independently associated with an increased risk of ICU admission and death.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the distributed gradient clock synchronization problem. As in traditional distributed clock synchronization, we consider {{a network of}} nodes equipped with hardware clocks with bounded drift. Nodes compute logical clock values based on their hardware clocks and message exchanges, and {{the goal is to}} synchronize the nodes ’ logical clocks as closely as possible, while satisfying certain validity conditions. The new feature of gradient clock synchronization (GCS for short) is to require that the skew between any two nodes ’ logical clocks be bounded by a nondecreasing function of the uncertainty in message <b>delay</b> (<b>call</b> this the distance) between the two nodes. That is, we require nearby nodes to be closely synchronized, and allow faraway nodes to be more loosely synchronized. We contrast GCS with traditional clock synchronization, and discuss several practical motivations for GCS, mostly arising in sensor and ad hoc networks. Our main result is that the worst case clock skew between two nodes at distance d from each other is log D log log D), where D is the diameter 1 of the network. Ω(d + This means that clock synchronization is not a local property, {{in the sense that the}} clock skew between two nodes depends not only on the distance between the nodes, but also on the size of the network. Our lower bound implies, for example, that the TDMA protocol with a fixed slot granularity will fail as the network grows, even if the maximum degree of each node stays constant.

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of delay depends {{to a large}} extent on the following four basic operations: delay, wakeup, interrupt, and resume. Traditional implementations of delay in the WAM are slow because three out of the four basic operations need to save or restore the argument registers. In this paper, we present a novel method for implementing delay in a Prolog machine called ATOAM. The main idea is to store <b>delayed</b> <b>calls</b> as frames, called suspension frames, on the control stack rather than as records on the heap. Since <b>delayed</b> <b>calls,</b> after being woken, can be executed directly by using their suspension frames, the four basic operations become very simple. This method had been predicated to cost a large amount of control stack space. However, with tail-recursion elimination, the control stack space requirement can be reduced dramatically. This method has been implemented in the B-Prolog system. For several benchmark programs where delay is used, the experimental results show that B-Prolog is [...] ...|$|R
