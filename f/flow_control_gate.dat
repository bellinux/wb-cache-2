40|$|A major {{contributing}} factor {{to the recent}} advances in deep neural networks is structural units that let sensory information and gradients to propagate easily. Gating is one such structure {{that acts as a}} <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> <b>Gates</b> are employed in many recent state-of-the-art recurrent models such as LSTM and GRU, and feedforward models such as Residual Nets and Highway Networks. This enables learning in very deep networks with hundred layers and helps achieve record-breaking results in vision (e. g., ImageNet with Residual Nets) and NLP (e. g., machine translation with GRU). However, there is limited work in analysing the role of gating in the learning process. In this paper, we propose a flexible $p$-norm gating scheme, which allows user-controllable flow and as a consequence, improve the learning speed. This scheme subsumes other existing gating schemes, including those in GRU, Highway Networks and Residual Nets as special cases. Experiments on large sequence and vector datasets demonstrate that the proposed gating scheme helps improve the learning speed significantly without extra overhead.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Recent {{opportunities}} for new hydropower generation in the United States {{have often been}} in non-powered dams and run-of-river type flows occurring in low-impact natural areas and unregulated conduits. At the same time, a changing water resource paradigm is challenging some existing generation in drought stricken areas where supply reservoirs behind many medium and high head units are at historically low levels. The result is a developing market space which is potentially best captured by machines capable of variable speed operation. Variable speed units have {{a wider range of}} operating conditions compared to their synchronous counterparts and have already proven their resilience through a 20 + year history in pumped hydro applications. This work develops a control scheme for variable speed hydropower units operating to deliver a set-point power through <b>flow</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>gates.</b> This <b>control</b> scheme increases both the hydrologic operating range of a unit as well as the speed of response to grid contingencies under droop and automatic generator control.

40|$|Modeling of {{flooding}} events resulting from bank overflooding and levee breaching is of relevant {{social and environmental}} interest. Two-dimensional (2 D) hydrodynamic models integrating the shallow water equations {{turn out to be}} very effective tools for the purpose at hand. Many of the available models also use 1 D channel elements, fully coupled to the 2 D model, to simulate the flow of small channels dissecting the urban and rural areas, and 1 D elements, referred to as 1 D-links, to efficiently model the flow over levees, road and rail embankments, bunds, the <b>flow</b> through <b>control</b> <b>gates,</b> either free or submerged, and the operation of other hydraulic structures. In this work we propose a physically-based 1 D-link to model breach formation and evolution in fluvial levees, and levee failure due to either piping or overtopping. The proposed 1 D-link is then embedded in a 1 D– 2 D hydrodynamic model, thus accounting for critical feedbacks between breach formation and changes in the hydrodynamic flow field. The breach model also includes the possibility of simulating breach closure, an important feature particularly in the view of hydraulic risk assessment and management of the emergency. The model is applied to five different case studies and the results of the numerical simulations compare favorably with field observations displaying a good agreement in terms of urban and rural flooded areas, water levels within the channel, final breach widths, and water volumes flowed through the breach...|$|R

This flash EEPROM cell incorporates two separate <b>control</b> <b>gates,</b> located an {{opposite sides of}} the silicon film. One is a conventional <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> fabricated on top of the film as in bulk cells. The second <b>control</b> <b>gate</b> is the back gate itself, which is located underneath the silicon film and is inherent to all SOI MOSFET structures.

In this scheme the back gate and the drain are used to invert the back channel and operate it in the impact ionization regime, such as to produce electron/hole pairs. Most of the generated electrons flow into the drain and some are injected into the back (buried) oxide. The holes, however, are accelerated towards the front gate, and many are finally injected into the floating gate, sandwiched between the front gate dioxide and front <b>control</b> <b>gate.</b> A prototype flash EEPROM cell was fabricated using a standard 1 -metal, 1 -poly CMOS SOI process and tested for concept proof.

HEC-RAS has a small selection of built-in gate types, representing some of the more common gates that are used for <b>controlling</b> <b>flow</b> at dams and canal structures. Each gate type in HEC-RAS has a set of empirical equations that are used to compute head loss through the structure for a given flow.

In the first study, 30 high-yielding cows in early lactation were subjected to two different degrees of controlled cow traffic, and the effects on milk yield, dry matter intake, feeding patterns and voluntary visits to the milking unit and the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> were measured. A model of mixed distributions for estimations of biologically relevant meal criteria from registrations in roughage stations was also evaluated. In the second study, the behaviour of 24 cows after they had been redirected in <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> was observed, {{and the cause of}} long redirection times from gates until they showed up in the milking unit was examined. In the third study, 9 cows were subjected to three different cow traffic systems in a carry-over design and the effects on cortisol concentrations in milk and ruminating patterns were studied. The studies showed that milking frequency and thereby milk production can be altered by different time settings in the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> without limiting the daily feed intake of the cows. A high degree of guidance provokes social effects in the queue in front of the milking unit and in the feeding areas. It also makes it difficult for the cows to follow their natural feeding patterns. Judging from measurements of milk cortisol concentrations, controlled cow traffic was not stressful for the cows. Cows initiated meals with short intervals, which offered many opportunities to milk them. But the queue in front of the milking unit caused long redirection times, and the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> failed to guide cows to high milking frequencies. Individual differences in feeding patterns and how cows respond to redirections in the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> suggest that the <b>control</b> <b>gates</b> should be making decisions on an individual level...|$|R

40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) {{is formed}} {{by a group}} of mobile nodes {{connected}} by wireless links. The nodes can talk to each other by direct peer-to-peer wireless communication when they are close to each other. When the sender and receiver are far away, their packets can be forwarded by the intermediate nodes along a multi-hop path. As an emerging networking technique, a MANET is envisioned to become a stand-alone network for a group of mobile users, or as a stub-network to connect to the Internet. In this thesis, we focus on the <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> problem in this network. Depending on whether the routers agree to forward packets for each other, different <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes are proposed for both cooperative and non-cooperative MANET environments. In cooperative <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> we first study the two prominent <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes in the Internet, i. e., TCP and equation-based <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> We provide an augmentation to TCP in order to improve its performance, and discover several limitations of applying equation-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> to the MANET domain. Prompted by the deficiencies of these implicit <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes, we design a router-assisted explicit rate-based <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> scheme (called EXACT) for MANETs. Our result shows that EXACT achieves much better performance than the implicit <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> schemes. Therefore, we advocate using router-assisted explicit <b>flow</b> <b>control,</b> as exemplified by EXACT, in the MANET domain. Traditionally, <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> has been studied in a cooperative network environment. Such cooperative behavior is not a realistic assumption in a public MANET formed by a random group of strangers. Users in this network are likely to behave selfishly, by refusing to forward other users' packets. Under this non-cooperative environment, <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering are two problems closely related to each other. A <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> solution would be meaningless if the intermediate routers do not agree to carry the traffic for others. However, existing work in incentive engineering provides only stand-alone solutions, and fails to recognize its close relation with <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> To this end, we propose a scheme called iPass, which is a joint solution for <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering in MANETs. iPass adopts the ``pay for service'' model of cooperation, and utilizes an auction mechanism at each router to fairly allocate bandwidth resources to the passing flows. At the same time, the auction market gives explicit rate signals to the end hosts for <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> purposes. By design of the auction algorithm, iPass achieves several desirable system properties, such as bidding user's true valuation for bandwidth. Therefore, iPass provides an innovative and graceful solution for the <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> and incentive engineering problems in a non-cooperative MANET environment...|$|R
