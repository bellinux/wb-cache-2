5|$|The player embarks {{with the}} {{expedition}} team (seven dwarves, their livestock and supplies), {{and does not}} have direct control over them. In order to construct and operate the fortress, the player has to designate specific tasks to be performed and the dwarves will <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> They can be assigned any labors, but their work still depends on their relative skill with it, which can increase as they perform the said task. Some task categories are stone-working, woodworking, metalworking, farming, and crafting; there are further combat-related skills. They are categorized further, such as are leatherworking, butchery, clothesmaking, gem-related, glassmaking, and clay-related industries. Activities take place in workshops which need to be constructed; for example, stills for brewing alcohol. The metal industry has {{a very important role}} because it produces weapons and armor for the military, trap components for defense, and high-value furniture and decorations.|$|E
25|$|The 22 November 1970 {{edition of}} The Sunday Times {{reported}} that on 5 August 1967, {{four days before}} the murder, Orton went to the Chelsea Potter pub in the King's Road. He met friend Peter Nolan, who later gave evidence at the inquest that Orton told him that he had another boyfriend and wanted to end his relationship with Halliwell, but {{did not know how to}} <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Yorkists regroup, {{and at the}} Battle of Towton, Clifford {{is killed}} and the Yorkists are victorious. Following the battle, Edward is proclaimed king, George is proclaimed Duke of Clarence and Richard, Duke of Gloucester, {{although}} he complains to Edward {{that this is an}} ominous dukedom. King Edward and George then leave the court, and Richard reveals to the audience his ambition to rise to power and take the throne from his brother, although as yet he is unsure how to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{important}} Plautine stock character, {{discussed by}} K.C. Ryder, is the senex amator. A senex amator {{is classified as}} {{an old man who}} contracts a passion for a young girl and who, in varying degrees, attempts to satisfy this passion. In Plautus these men are Demaenetus (Asinaria), Philoxenus and Nicobulus (Bacchides), Demipho (Cistellaria), Lysidamus (Casina), Demipho (Mercator), and Antipho (Stichus). Periplectomenos (Miles Gloriosus) and Daemones (Rudens) are regarded as senes lepidi because they usually keep their feelings within a respectable limit. All of these characters have the same goal, to be with a younger woman, but all <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> in different ways, as Plautus could not be too redundant with his characters despite their already obvious similarities. What they have in common is the ridicule with which their attempts are viewed, the imagery that suggests that they are motivated largely by animal passion, the childish behavior, and the reversion to the love-language of their youth.|$|E
500|$|During {{the time}} Hoffman held the career record for saves, many still {{considered}} Rivera the best closer of all time. Like many other relievers of his era, Hoffman {{was compared to}} Rivera and his success in the playoffs. While Hoffman had 601 regular-season saves, he only had four in the playoffs. Jayson Stark of ESPN wrote after Hoffman's retirement announcement, [...] "Not everybody can have his team deliver him an October save opportunity to protect 47 different times." [...] His last postseason save was in 2006, which was also his first postseason save in eight years. [...] Though the Padres were in the playoffs three other times in that span, they never took a single lead. Hoffman, however, did blow a save opportunity in his only World Series appearance and also failed on save tries twice in the final three days of the 2007 season as the Padres vied for the playoffs. John Delcos of The Journal News, who covered the New York Yankees for eight years, believes the Yankees {{would have been just}} as successful with Hoffman instead of Rivera. David Wells, who played with both Hoffman and Rivera, said, [...] " [...] has the better postseason record because the Yankees go to the postseason more than the Padres do, and he's had more opportunities there. The way they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> they're the best in the game. Trevor's the best in the West and [...] {{is the best in the}} East." [...] Rivera, however, broke Hoffman's career save record in 2011.|$|E
2500|$|Allah's Apostle said, [...] "My similitude in {{comparison}} with the other prophets before me, is that {{of a man who has}} built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner.

2500|$|Theoretical {{physicist}} Kip Thorne was {{a scientific}} {{consultant for the}} film to ensure the depictions of wormholes and relativity were as accurate as possible. [...] "For the depictions of the wormholes and the black hole," [...] he said, [...] "we discussed how to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> and then I worked on the equations that would enable tracing of light rays as they traveled through a wormhole or around a black hole—so {{what you see is}} based on Einstein's general relativity equations." ...|$|E
2500|$|Amid the carnage, Lieutenant Colonel Albert Caro, Major Ben Hearman and Lieutenant Colonel Cooper all protested to Dougherty {{that his}} tactics were at fault. They all were punished with {{transfers}} to backwaters. Cooper (shot in the hip at Gona) has recalled; [...] "...they {{used to say}} there were two types of officers: those who were always going to reach the top, and then the others that are always at fault. But {{then there is the}} other type like Arnold Potts, who just get on with the job and do it superbly. They are efficient and successful and save men's lives while they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> But Arnold Potts wasn't at Gona.|$|E
2500|$|In 1893, Masqueray {{opened the}} Atelier Masqueray, {{for the study}} of {{architecture}} according to French methods; architect Walter B. Chambers shared in this enterprise. Located at 123 E. 23rd Street, this was the first wholly independent atelier opened in the United States. A colorful, dynamic teacher, Masqueray pleaded with his students to make things simple. Beginning in 1899, Masqueray made special provision for women to number among his architectural students by establishing a second atelier especially for women at 37–40 West 22nd Street in New York. As was said at the time, [...] "...he has unbounded faith in women's ability to succeed in architecture...provided they <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> seriously." ...|$|E
60|$|Carter Weatherbee followed, without haste {{and without}} enthusiasm. There was neither pity nor passion in his face, {{but rather the}} patient, stolid look of one who has certain work to do and <b>goes</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> methodically.|$|R

60|$|One point which told powerfully {{with those}} whom Ned sought to win was, that he <b>went</b> <b>about</b> endeavouring, {{as far as}} in him lay, to undo the evil that he had done.

2500|$|After the UDI, ZANU {{officials}} mapped {{an elaborate}} {{plan for the}} [...] "liberation of Zimbabwe" [...] which called for attacks on white farmers, destruction of cash crops, disrupting electricity in urban areas, and petrol bombings. Sithole and Nkomo both insisted {{on the need for}} armed struggle, but disagreed on the means to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> For example, ZAPU tended to follow Soviet thinking, placing an emphasis on sophisticated weaponry in the hopes of winning a conventional battle like the Viet Minh at Dien Bien Phu. ZANU preferred to politicise populations in areas which they intended to seize. Neither force, however, had acquired basic knowledge of guerrilla warfare. Debate on political theory and insurgent tactics became the obsession of nationalists at this stage.|$|E
2500|$|... "California" [...] {{follows the}} abusive {{relationship}} featured in [...] "Massachusetts". [...] "California" [...] refers to {{getting out of}} the relationship and forgetting about it despite the difficulties in doing so. The music for [...] "To Live and to Lose" [...] was the first piece of music written for the album and Told said [...] "it was strange to start the writing process with such an experimental track". Told was unsure at first about how to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> vocally and lyrically. Told, with his girlfriend's help, placed himself as the character he was writing. [...] "With Second Chances" [...] went through the most changes before the final version appeared on the album. The band were fighting about what they should do with the song. Told defended the song as he liked the chorus the fact it had [...] "a lot of different ideas" [...] in it. With [...] "Departures", the band knew what the intention was {{for the end of the}} song but where unsure about the beginning of the song. Rousseau brought up the idea of using [...] "backward effects, playing things forward and then reversing them", as Told mentions.|$|E
2500|$|While Borges was {{the great}} popularizer of the review of an {{imaginary}} work, he had developed the idea from Thomas Carlyle's Sartor Resartus, a book-length review of a non-existent German transcendentalist work, and the biography of its equally non-existent author. In This Craft of Verse, Borges says that in 1916 in Geneva [...] " [...] discovered, and was overwhelmed by, Thomas Carlyle. I read Sartor Resartus, and I can recall many of its pages; I know them by heart." [...] In the introduction to his first published volume of fiction, The Garden of Forking Paths, Borges remarks, [...] "It is a laborious madness and an impoverishing one, the madness of composing vast books, setting out in five hundred pages an idea that can be perfectly related orally in five minutes. The better way to <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> is to pretend that those books already exist, and offer a summary, a commentary on them." [...] He then cites both Sartor Resartus and Samuel Butler's The Fair Haven, remarking, however, that [...] "those works suffer under the imperfection that they themselves are books, and not a whit less tautological than the others. A more reasonable, more inept, and more lazy man, I have chosen to write notes on imaginary books." ...|$|E

25|$|Liberal {{and feminist}} legal {{scholars}} have had various reactions to Roe, not always giving the decision unqualified support.

2500|$|According to Billy Vaughn Koen, the [...] "engineering {{method is}} the use of {{heuristics}} to cause the best change in a poorly understood situation within the available resources."

6000|$|... "You can't <b>go</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> to-day, Charlie," [...] said John Skyd, [...] "so don't {{give way}} to impatience. For such a long trip into the enemy's country we must go well armed and supplied." ...|$|E

5000|$|Three {{months after}} Moreno's death, Baron Fava was {{recalled}} [...] "at his own request" [...] to Italy.

60|$|Well, {{they all}} went away as above; and though the attempt was desperate, and such as none but madmen would have <b>gone</b> <b>about,</b> yet, to give them their due, they <b>went</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> warily as well as boldly.

Bolder fellows, and better provided, never <b>went</b> <b>about</b> any wicked work in the world.|$|R
