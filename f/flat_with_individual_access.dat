More succinctly, effective mentoring must be built on a commitment to providing every student <b>with</b> <b>individual</b> <b>access</b> to professional, collegial and supportive guidance throughout their enrollment in graduate program at UC Berkeley. The university’s rules and regulations govern many issues relating to the relationship between mentors and students.

40|$|Defined as the {{differential}} {{degree to which}} rich and poor countries benefit from new information and communi-cations technologies such as the Internet, the global digital divide is widely measured by international institutions {{in terms of the}} number of persons <b>with</b> <b>individual</b> <b>access</b> to those technologies. Yet, while this measure makes sense in the rich countries, where individual ownership is wide-spread among the population, it makes very little sense in poor countries. For, in the latter, what we find is that although <b>individual</b> <b>access</b> is indeed very limited, a remark-able number of local innovations ensure that the benefits of the Internet are made available to at least 10 million people throughout the Third World. Many such persons are illiter-ate, unskilled and resident in the rural areas of developing countries. These findings directly contradict the commonly held notion that there are few, if any, local innovations in the applications of the Internet outside the rich countries and those parts of poorer countries with close connections to the former (most typically through multinational corporations). From a policy point of view, we suggest that foreign aid donors and national governments pay less attention to providing <b>individual</b> <b>access</b> facilities such as so-called tele-centres and focus instead on ways to foster indigenous rural innovation systems devoted to finding relevant and cost-effective applications of the Internet. 1...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{fundamental}} ethics {{and purpose of}} elite higher education. Beginning with an inquiry {{into the history of}} American higher education, this work reveals that the U. S. News 2 ̆ 6 World Report “Best College” and “Best University” ranking lists hold an increasingly important role in distinguishing institutions, particularly those within the elite tier. Following an examination of the U. S. News’ methodology, this analysis confronts concerns <b>with</b> <b>individual</b> <b>access</b> to elite institutions. Although there are potential changes to the U. S. News’ methodology that could improve institutional assessment, this thesis does not propose alternative rankings. Rather, it focuses on many institutions’ problematic choice to use the rankings as a guide for admissions and institutional practice. This work evaluates the potentially stratifying components of elite institutions and questions what American higher education inculcates in students. This endeavor concludes by providing suggestions for how to democratize elite institutions in order to realize their respective missions and improve access to educational opportunities.

50|$|Community liberated: A {{cross-section}} {{of the community}} lost and community saved arguments, the community liberated theory suggests that the separation of workplace, residence and familial kinship groups has caused urbanites to maintain weak ties in multiple community groups that are further weakened by high rates of residential mobility.

40|$|Rates of {{food intake}} in animals {{consuming}} abundant prey can be {{constrained by the}} rates of digestion or excretion of ingested substances, such as salt, particularly so in the animals that regularly migrate between freshwater and saltwater environments. We tested this hypothesis in a long-distance migrant shorebird, the eastern curlew Numenius madagascariensis (suborder Charadrii), foraging on intertidal decapods in eastern Australia. We predicted that if food intake rates are constrained osmotically, <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>access</b> to freshwater and less saline prey (FW group) would have higher rates {{of food and water}} intake than <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> seawater-only <b>access</b> (SW group). Food intake rates did not differ between the FW and SW groups (0. 14 g ash-free dry mass min(- 1)), nor did the water influx rates (0. 75 g min(- 1)). Salt intake rates were lower at FW sites (19. 3 versus 23. 3 mg NaCl min(- 1)) and overall they were similar to those of marine birds. Food intake rate in the eastern curlew appeared limited by digestive rather than by osmoregulatory capacity...|$|R
