The {{purpose of this paper is}} to explore how a representative selection of 12 000 Europeans across all countries in the euro area view the effects of the euro five years after its introduction. The empirical analysis uses multinomial logistic regressions to explore the responses to two questions from the <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> conducted in September 2006. The first question asked if the adoption of the euro was advantageous overall or not. The second one asked if using the euro had made you personally feel a little more European than before or not.

40|$|The current {{proposal}} for a Common European Sales Law (CESL) makes a number of empirical claims in support of its argument that differences in contract law among Member States are stifling trade, and that CESL will address these barriers to cross-border trade.

40|$|To {{study the}} interplay between age and culture as driver of {{self-employment}} motivation, we examine cross-sectional age differences (young to late adulthood) in self-employment desirability and feasibility beliefs across different cultures. We utilize individual-level data from the 2012 <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> collected in 21 countries (total N = 13, 963 individuals) and culture-level data from the GLOBE project. Our results from multi-level regression analyses show similar curvilinear lifespan patterns in both desirability and feasibility beliefs, with a peak in young adulthood and a strong decline toward late adulthood. This general pattern of age differences in these motivational factors, however, differs significantly across cultural dimensions of uncertainty avoidance, institutional collectivism and performance orientation. Notwithstanding the limitations of cross-sectional data, the present results indicate that individual factors motivating self-employment are systematically intertwined with, and embedded in, both age and culture.

40|$|This paper investigates {{differences}} between opportunity and necessity entrepreneurs {{in terms of}} socio-demographics, attitudes and perception of 'obstacles'. We use the 2004 <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> data. Explanatory variables include gender, age, education level and self-employed parents, risk tolerance, locus of control, perceptions of four 'obstacles' and country effects. The 'obstacle' variables include the perception of availibility of financial support; administrative complexity; of access to information on new venture creation and an unfavorable economic climate. Using probit equations we investigate differences in the preference for self-employment of opportunity and necessity entrepreneurs. A probit equation is estimated relating the explanatory variables to opportunity versus necessity entrepreneurship. Moreover, differences in the entrepreneurial engagement of opportunity and necessity entrepreneurs are investigated {{on the basis of}} a (ordered) multinomial logit model. Findings indicate that opportunity entrepreneurs have a higher preference for self-employment because of family encouragement. Also, opportunity entrepreneurs are found to perceive of administrative complexity and an unfavorable economic climate, negatively influencing their entrepreneurial involvement, while this is not the case for necessity entrepreneurs. ...|$|E

This study investigates which countries {{have the highest}} potential to achieve entrepreneurial progress. This progress is defined as an entrepreneurial ladder with five successive steps: 'never thought about starting a business', 'thinking about it', 'taking steps', 'running a young business' and 'running a mature business'. The influences of individual-level and country-level variables on the progression through these stages are analysed. Data from twenty-seven European countries and the United States are used (2007 <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> on Entrepreneurship). Findings show that in the United States many people think about setting up a business, whereas Europeans are better at achieving higher levels of engagement.

40|$|Over {{the last}} decades, {{the concept of}} social {{entrepreneurship}} has been praised for its attractiveness due to its ability to provide entrepreneurial solutions to social issues. Still, research into social entrepreneurship {{is in a state}} of infancy. A lot of research into this concept is centered on the formulation of a plausible definition. Parker (2008) has taken his research a step further, by creating a theory on the concept. This theory is called the neoclassical life-cycle theory and makes assumptions on the type of people who have a higher probability to be social entrepreneurs. The theory also describes at which stage in life individuals are more probable to be social entrepreneurs. This thesis tests the neoclassical life-cycle theory. In so doing, the age distribution of social entrepreneurs is firstly tested, followed by the relationship between social entrepreneurs in different age groups and patient consuming behavior. The final subject of interest is the relationship between social entrepreneurs in different age groups and their satisfaction with household income.

Only the blood alcohol concentration limit for driving and health warnings on advertisements and/or alcoholic beverage containers showed a significant effect, increasing risk perceptions among adolescents. Three sources of information dissemination about alcohol's risks and effects showed significant influence on risk perceptions. While information {{about the risks of}} alcohol from parents increased risk perceptions, information from friends decreased it. The influence of media campaigns was only marginal, though indicating a small decrease in risk perceptions.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to shed light on {{traditionally}} important determinants (demographics, peoples’ perceptions, and environmental characteristics) of entrepreneurial engagement in the post-socialist region of the European Union (EU). Design/methodology/approach – A rich data set obtained from the <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> on Entrepreneurship 2007 is used, while a binomial probit regression model is employed. Findings – Gender, mother’s occupation, unemployment, and economic growth are reported as significant determinants of entrepreneurship. The econometric results also suggest that lack of financial resources, individual’s risk aversion, a large number of start-up procedures, and increased tax rates are all positively, rather than negatively related to entrepreneurial engagement. Research limitations/implications – It is suggested that the recent structural changes that have occurred in the examined region, as well as the transition process under which the examined countries operate have influenced the attitude of individuals towards entrepreneurial engagement. Originality/value – The study provides useful information in relation to the attitude of a post-socialist society towards structural issues which have possibly impeded its engagement to entrepreneurship.

This is particularly true of the effect of age on awareness of environmental effects. My aim in this study is to model the relationship between age and environmental consciousness using a large sample of over twenty six thousand respondents in 28 countries to a specially designed survey requested by the European Commission. I use the 2009 <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> (no. 256) designed to address European attitudes towards sustainable consumption. I choose six questions from the survey in order to capture measures of environmental knowledge, attitudes and behaviour. Using multiple regression analysis, I test for the influence of age on environmental consciousness after controlling for gender, education level, occupation and urban vs. rural residence. The results reveal an interesting ‘inverse U’ shape of environmental consciousness by age for both men and women implying that environmental consciousness peaks at middle age. Extending the regression into multilevel modelling, allows me to test for variations in the inverse U shape across countries of Europe. The results indicate country level variations in both the level and shape of the curve from one country to another. Although similar in many countries, caution is required in making gross generalisations about age related sustainable consumption patterns in Europe as a whole...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: The Internet {{is widely}} {{accessed}} for health information, but poor quality information {{may lead to}} health-worsening behaviours (e. g. non-compliance). Little {{is known about the}} health of individuals who use the Internet for health information. METHODS: Using the <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>survey</b> 404, European Union (EU) citizens aged ??? 15 (n = 26 566) were asked about Internet utilisation for health information ('general' or 'disease-specific'), the sources used, self-rated health, and socioeconomic variables. Multivariable logistic regression was employed to assess the likelihood of bad self-rated health and accessing different health information sources (social networks, official website, online newspaper, dedicated websites, search engines). RESULTS: Those searching for general information were less likely to report bad health [odds ratios (OR) = 0. 80; 95 % confidence intervals (CI) : 0. 70 - 0. 92], whilst those searching for disease-specific information were more likely (OR = 1. 22; 95 % CI: 1. 07 - 1. 38). Higher education and frequent doctor visits were associated with use of official websites and dedicated apps for health. Variation between EU member states in the proportion of people who had searched for general or disease-specific information online was high. CONCLUSIONS: Searching for general health information may be more conducive to better health, as it is easier to understand, and those accessing it may already be or looking to lead healthier lives. Disease-specific information may be harder to understand and assimilate into appropriate care worsening self-rated health. It may also be accessed if health services fail to meet individuals' needs, and health status is currently poor. Ensuring individuals' access to quality health services and health information will be key to addressing inequalities in health...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to shed light on demographic, {{environmental}} and perceptional characteristics and their impact on entrepreneurial engagement in the post-socialist region of the European Union (EU). Data from the <b>Flash</b> <b>Eurobarometer</b> <b>Survey</b> on Entrepreneurship 2007 are used, while a binomial probit regression model is employed. In total, 3, 454 observations from eight transition economies of the EU are incorporated in the model. In the econometric analysis, a set of individual and country-level variables is used and provides evidence that males, as well as individuals whose mother was entrepreneur are more likely to engage in entrepreneurship. On the other hand, economic factors, such as unemployment and economic growth are both reported as negative determinants of self-employment. Interestingly the findings also suggest that lack of financial resources, a large number of start-up procedures and increased tax rates are all positively related to entrepreneurial engagement. Finally, risk-averse individuals are more likely to get involved with entrepreneurship compared to risk lovers. Implications are discussed analytically and it is suggested that the existing structural changes and transition process under which the examined countries operate have influenced the attitude of individuals toward entrepreneurial engagement throughout the last two decades. The study provides useful information in relation to the attitude of post-socialist society toward structural issues which possibly dishearten its engagement to entrepreneurship. First, the geographical area approves of great interest since it provides new evidence regarding the perceptions of people who live in this particular post-socialist region. Second, the time this research was conducted (i. e. 2007) means now is an ideal time for re-examination, considering that these countries have recently become members of the EU. ...|$|E
