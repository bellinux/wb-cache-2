2500|$|The <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> <b>Project</b> (<b>HGP)</b> was an {{international}} scientific research project {{with the goal}} of determining the sequence of nucleotide base pairs that make up human DNA, and of identifying and mapping all of the genes of the human genome from both a physical and [...] a functional standpoint. It remains the world's largest collaborative biological project. After the idea was picked up in 1984 by the US government when the planning started, the project formally launched in 1990 and was declared complete in 2003. Funding came from the US government through the National Institutes of Health (NIH) as well as numerous other groups from around the world. A parallel project was conducted outside government by the Celera Corporation, or Celera Genomics, which was formally launched in 1998. Most of the government-sponsored sequencing was performed in twenty universities and research centers in the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan, France, Germany, Canada, and China.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: With the {{development}} of <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> <b>projects</b> (<b>HGP)</b> in the world, a mass of genetic information is generated. Now {{there are hundreds of}} different kinds of important bioinformatics databases in the world. How to unify the bioinformatics database from different countries has become an important issue in Bioinformatics. In this paper, we present a data integra-tion program based on Web Services of heterogeneous bioinformatics databases. The key technology of bioinformatics data integration has been researched and designed as well...|$|R
40|$|The age of genomic {{medicine}} is upon us. Sixty {{years have passed}} since Watson and Crick’s discovery about the dou-ble-helical structure of DNA (Watson and Crick 1953). Ten {{years have passed since}} the <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> <b>Project’s</b> (<b>HGP)</b> completion (International <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> Sequencing Consortium 2004). We now witness the trans-lation of this basic science into direct patient care. With the cost of sequencing a <b>human</b> <b>genome</b> rapidly moving toward the $ 1000 mark, genomic evaluation in the every-day clinical setting is becoming a reality. Genomics has successfully been applied to many clinical areas, including rare disease diagnosis, pharmacogenetics, and a wide range of cancer diagnoses. Large databases and projects characterizing human variation such as the HapMap, the NHLBI Exome Variant Server, and the 1000 <b>Genomes</b> <b>Project</b> have been established and provide a touchstone for the interpretation of clinical genomic data. Despite these and many other milestones, we are still {{at the dawn of the}} genomic age. Three billion pieces of the DNA puzzle have been placed on the table, but the puzzle is far from complete. The aim of the journal Molecular Genetics & Genomic Medicine (MGGM) is to not only participate in the assembly of the puzzle but also to help interpret the image as it is revealed, thereby bringing a new level of understanding to human, medical, and molecular genetics. Rapidly evolving genomic technologies have given geneticists the tools to make efficient molecular diagnoses in diseases that had previously gone undiagnosed even after exhaustive genetic and clinical evaluations. At this moment, Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM...|$|R

In 1993, NCHGR expanded its role on the NIH campus by establishing the Division of Intramural Research (DIR) to apply genome technologies to the study of specific diseases. In 1996, the Center for Inherited Disease Research (CIDR) was also established (co-funded by eight NIH institutes and centers) to study the genetic components of complex disorders.|$|E
50|$|Another major {{critique}} is {{that the}} results do not justify {{the amount of time}} spent on the project and that the project itself is essentially unfinishable. Although often compared to <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> <b>Project</b> (<b>HGP)</b> and even termed as the HGP next step, the HGP had a clear endpoint which ENCODE currently lacks. The authors seem to sympathize with the scientific concerns and at the same time try to justify their efforts by giving interviews and explaining ENCODE details not just to the scientific public, but also to mass media. They also claim that it took more than half a century from the realization that DNA is the hereditary material of life to the human genome sequence, so that their plan for the next century would be to really understand the sequence itself.|$|E

50|$|There {{were two}} main groups {{attempting}} to sequence the human genome: {{the first was}} the <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> <b>Project</b> (<b>HGP),</b> a publicly funded effort that intended to publish the information it obtained freely and without restrictions. Many research groups from countries all over the world were involved in this collaborative effort. The second effort was undertaken by Celera Genomics, which intended to patent the information obtained and charge subscriptions for use of the sequence data. (Celera has since abandoned this policy and has donated large amounts of sequence information for free public use.) Established first, the HGP moved slowly in the early phases of research as the role of the Department of Energy was unclear and sequencing technology was in its infancy. When Celera entered the race to discover the genome, the pressure was on the HGP to establish as much of the genome in the public domain as quickly as possible. This was a change of strategy for the HGP, because many scientists at the time wanted a more complete copy of the genome. Along {{with other members of the}} HGP, Lander pushed for quicker discovery so that genes would not be discovered and patented by Celera first.|$|E
5000|$|In 1967, S. B. Carter {{reported}} {{the use of}} shadow-evaporated palladium islands for cell attachment. After this first bio-MEMS study, subsequent development in the field was slow for around 20 years. In 1985, Unipath Inc. commercialized ClearBlue, a pregnancy test still used today that can be considered the first microfluidic device containing paper and the first microfluidic product to market. In 1990, Andreas Manz and H. Michael Widmer from Ciba-Geigy (now Novartis), Switzerland first coined the term micro total analysis system (μTAS) in their seminal paper proposing the use of miniaturized total chemical analysis systems for chemical sensing. There have been three major motivating factors behind the concept of μTAS. Firstly, drug discovery in the last decades {{leading up to the}} 1990s had been limited due to the time and cost of running many chromatographic analyses in parallel on macroscopic equipment. Secondly, the <b>Human</b> <b>Genome</b> <b>Project</b> (<b>HGP),</b> which started in October 1990, created demand for improvements in DNA sequencing capacity. Capillary electrophoresis thus became a focus for chemical and DNA separation. Thirdly, DARPA of the US Department of Defense supported a series of microfluidic research programs in the 1990s after realizing there was a need to develop field-deployable microsystems for the detection of chemical and biological agents that were potential military and terrorist threats. Researchers started to use photolithography equipment for microfabrication of microeletromechanical systems (MEMS) as inherited from the microelectronics industry. At the time, the application of MEMS to biology was limited because this technology was optimized for silicon or glass wafers and used solvent-based photoresists that were not compatible with biological material. In 1993, George M. Whitesides, a Harvard chemist, introduced inexpensive PDMS-based microfabrication and this revolutionized the bio-MEMS field. Since then, the field of bio-MEMS has exploded.
