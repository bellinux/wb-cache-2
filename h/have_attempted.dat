5|$|In {{the late}} Campanian of North America, Daspletosaurus was a {{contemporary}} of the albertosaurine tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus. This {{is one of}} the few examples of two tyrannosaur genera coexisting. In modern predator guilds, similar-sized predators are separated into different ecological niches by anatomical, behavioral or geographical differences that limit competition. Several studies <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> to explain niche differentiation in Daspletosaurus and Gorgosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Several German art experts <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> {{to refute}} all the claims made by Hawass, {{pointing}} to the 1924 document discussing the pact between Borchardt and the Egyptian authorities, though, as discussed earlier, Borchardt {{has been accused of}} foul play in the deal. The German authorities have also argued the bust is too fragile to transport and that the legal arguments for the repatriation were insubstantial. According to The Times, Germany may be concerned that lending the bust to Egypt would mean its permanent departure from Germany.|$|E

5|$|Some philosophers, such as Paul Boghossian, <b>have</b> <b>attempted</b> to {{show that}} eliminativism is in some sense self-refuting, since the theory itself presupposes the {{existence}} of mental phenomena.

Hence, for eliminativism to be asserted as a thesis, the eliminativist must believe that it is true; if that is the case, then there are beliefs and the eliminativist claim is false.|$|E

The authors conclude that if the public ceased engaging in denial, the problem of climate change could be realistically addressed.|$|E
