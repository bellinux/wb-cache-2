500|$|The lyrics on Sons of Soul were {{described}} by Los Angeles Times critic Connie Johnson as often quirky, while Elysa Gardner from Vibe {{said they were}} flirtatious and tender, particularly on ballads such as [...] "Slow Wine" [...] and [...] "(Lay Your <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>My)</b> Pillow"; she felt the group's songwriting throughout the album possessed a [...] "reverent" [...] ethos. Raphael Wiggins was credited {{with the majority of}} the songwriting. Laura Zucker of The Sacramento Bee said most of the album was written [...] "solidly in the R tradition of sweet talking and romancing." [...] Unlike most contemporary R and hip hop music at the time, the album's lyrics lacked profane language, with the exception of [...] "My Ex-Girlfriend", which featured the chorus [...] "I couldn't believe it / They tried to tell me my ex-girlfriend is a !" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Slow Wine" [...] {{describes}} a Trinidadian slow grind dance, {{and the love}} ballad [...] "(Lay Your <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>My)</b> Pillow" [...] features tender, seductive lyrics, with subtle s, which according to Gil Griffin of The Washington Post [...] "replace hip-hop braggadocio with soul music's promise." [...] "I Couldn't Keep It to Myself" [...] features lush strings and electric piano, which according to one writer [...] "create a jaunty atmosphere that harkens back to early Kool and the Gang and the Blackbyrds." [...] Its narrator wants to brag to his friends about his new girlfriend's sexual abilities. [...] "Gangsta Groove" [...] adapts hip hop's [...] "" [...] trope in a humane story, compared by one writer to a blaxploitation theme. It draws on the funk music of Parliament-Funkadelic, Cameo, and the Ohio Players. [...] "Tonyies! In the Wrong Key" [...] features a dreamy, dissonant soundscape, slurred vocals, swirling horns, and a James Brown sample. At its end, Raphael Wiggins sings the line [...] "last night a DJ saved my life", {{a reference to the}} 1982 song of the same name. Wiggins found his [...] "disinterested" [...] vocal style similar to Sly Stone's [...] "Family Affair" [...] (1971).|$|E
2500|$|James Perone {{writes of}} the second track from Pet Sounds, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "One of the high points of the {{composition}} and Brian's vocal performance ... is the snaky, though generally descending melodic line on the line 'I want to cry,' his response {{to the realization that}} his girlfriend still believes in him despite his past failures." [...] He describes the [...] "stepwise falloff of the interval of a third {{at the end of each}} verse" [...] to be a typically [...] "Wilsonian" [...] feature. The feature recurs alongside a [...] "madrigal sigh motif" [...] in [...] "That's Not Me", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. This sighing motif then appears in the next track, [...] "Don't Talk (Put Your <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Shoulder)", a piece inspired by classical music, and once again in the closing [...] "Caroline, No".|$|E
60|$|She put {{her arms}} round my neck, and rested her <b>head</b> quietly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom. <b>On</b> the {{opposite}} wall hung the miniature portrait of her father. I bent over her, and {{saw that she was}} looking at it while her <b>head</b> lay <b>on</b> <b>my</b> breast.|$|R
25|$|In 1980–1981 Eno {{collaborated with}} David Byrne of Talking <b>Heads</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Life in the Bush of Ghosts, {{which was built}} around radio {{broadcasts}} Eno collected while living in the United States, along with sampling recordings {{from around the world}} transposed over music predominantly inspired by African and Middle Eastern rhythms.|$|R

2500|$|Responding to the songwriters' denials of a {{conscious}} lyric theme, Nick Kent observed: [...] " [...] album documents the male participant's attempts at {{coming to terms}} with himself and the world about him. Each song pinpoints a crisis of faith in love and life: confusion ('That's Not Me'), disorientation (the staggeringly beautiful 'I Just Wasn't Made for These Times'), recognition of love's capricious impermanence ('Here Today') and finally, the grand betrayal of innocence featured in 'Caroline, No'." [...] From another viewpoint, author Scott Schinder has written that Wilson and Asher crafted an [...] "emotion-charge song cycle that surveyed the emotional challenges accompanying the transition from youth to adulthood." [...] Schinder continues: [...] "Lyrically, Pet Sounds encompassed the loss of innocent idealism ("Caroline, No"), the transient nature of love ("Here Today"), faith in the face of heartbreak ("I'm Waiting for the Day"), the demands and disappointments of independence ("That's Not Me"), the feeling of being {{out of step with the}} modern world ("I Just Wasn't Made for These Times"), and the longing for a happy, loving future ("Wouldn't It Be Nice"). The album also featured a series of intimate, hymn-like love songs, [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "Don't Talk (Put Your <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Shoulder)", and [...] "God Only Knows"." ...|$|E
2500|$|Catholicism {{is shown}} to still exist in some form in the 31st century, as the show makes several {{references}} to the [...] "Space Pope": in the opening titles of [...] "Hell is Other Robots" [...] (stating that the show has been [...] "Condemned by the Space Pope"); in [...] "A Bicyclops Built for Two", with Bender's rhetorical question [...] "Is the Space Pope reptilian?"; and in [...] "I Dated a Robot", in an endorsement {{at the end of}} an educational film ("Brought to you by the Space Pope"). [...] In the last of these, a graphic displays a picture of the Space Pope as a reptilian alien in Papal vestments, encircled by the words Crocodylus pontifex. Additionally, in the episode [...] "Put Your <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Shoulders", Fry and Amy Wong have a lighthearted conversation about their parents' expectations of them; Fry remarks, [...] "What am I, the Pope?" [...] to which Amy replies, [...] "Yeah, and if you were the Pope they'd be all, 'Straighten your Pope hat,' and 'Put on your good vestments!'" [...] In the sixth season episode, The Duh-Vinci Code, the cast travels to Rome (announced as Future-Roma), where the Space Pope directs the ship's landing at the Vatican. A few episodes later, in [...] "The Silence of the Clamps," [...] the Space Pope is shown conducting the wedding of the Donbot's older daughter.|$|E
2500|$|Fussili {{states that}} Wilson's {{tendency}} to [...] "wander {{far from the}} logic of his composition only to return triumphantly to confirm the emotional intent of his work" [...] is repeated numerous times in Pet Sounds, but never to [...] "evoke a sense of unbridled joy" [...] as Wilson recently had with the single [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". In the example of [...] "God Only Knows", which contains an ambivalent key and non-diatonic chords, musicologist Philip Lambert cites its [...] "choral fantasy" [...] section to contain complex key changes that elude the listener [...] "for the entire experience—that in fact, the idea of 'key' has itself been challenged and subverted". Perone's interpretation also suggests a visceral musical continuity. On the second track [...] "You Still Believe in Me", [...] "One of the high points of the composition and Brian's vocal performance... is the snaky, though generally descending melodic line on the line 'I want to cry,' his response {{to the realization that}} his girlfriend still believes in him despite his past failures." [...] He describes the [...] "stepwise falloff of the interval of a third {{at the end of each}} verse" [...] to be a typically [...] "Wilsonian" [...] feature that recurs throughout the album in addition to a [...] "madrigal sigh motif" [...] that can be heard in [...] "That's Not Me", where the motif concludes each line of the verses. This sighing motif appears in the next track, [...] "Don't Talk (Put Your <b>Head</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Shoulder)", a piece inspired by classical music, and once again in [...] "Caroline, No". For the high-pitched electric bass guitar part in [...] "Here Today", Perone says they bring to mind similar parts in [...] "God Only Knows", culminating in what sounds like the vocal protagonist of [...] "Here Today" [...] warning the protagonist of [...] "God Only Knows" [...] that what he sings stands no chance at longevity. The protagonist's relationship then concludes shortly after [...] "I Just Wasn't Made for These Times", while [...] "Caroline, No" [...] is a rumination in broken love.|$|E

60|$|In a moment, my {{arms were}} round her. Her <b>head</b> sank <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom. We were {{reconciled}} without a word. We were friends again, sisters again, in an instant.|$|R

60|$|It was {{the best}} way I could have taken to compose her. She laid her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, and smiled faintly through her tears.|$|E

5000|$|Chilean {{pop singer}} Myriam Hernández, {{together}} with Anka, recorded a Spanglish version for his duets album Amigos. Canadian crooner and Paul Anka protégé Michael Bublé also recorded a lushly arranged {{version of it}} on his eponymously titled 2003 debut album. The Pop Punk band Good Charlotte also did {{a version of the}} song in the movie Not Another Teen Movie entitled [...] "Put Your <b>Heads</b> <b>on</b> <b>My</b> Shoulder," [...] which originally aired in 2001. The song is also featured in the video game Hitman: Contracts.|$|R
6000|$|It {{was granted}} me to stand [...] By my dead. [...] I {{have felt the}} {{vanished}} hand [...] <b>On</b> <b>my</b> <b>head,</b> [...] <b>On</b> <b>my</b> brow the vanished lips, [...] And I know that Death's eclipse [...] Is a floating veil that slips, [...] Or is shed.|$|R
6000|$|Idris {{understood}} me: she {{bowed her}} <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder and wept. [...] "Why," [...] she again asked, [...] "do you tremble, Lionel, what shakes you thus?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is for the}} Maid, and for you, Elliot," [...] I whispered; and {{she only}} bent her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, but her cold hand gripped mine firmly.|$|E
60|$|For seven sad months our dear {{sufferer}} lingered. I {{have only}} one remembrance to comfort me; my mother's last kiss was mine--she died peacefully with her <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom.|$|E
60|$|The {{excitement}} had now burned itself out: she {{had dropped}} her <b>head</b> wearily <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, and bade me take her back. When I had safely deposited {{her on the}} couch again, she remained for some minutes with her face covered, silently weeping.|$|R
6000|$|She {{had neither}} heeded nor heard me. [...] "Let {{go of my}} hand," [...] she {{repeated}} faintly. That was her only answer. Her <b>head</b> sank <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder; and her hand unconsciously closed on mine, {{at the moment when}} she asked me to release it.|$|R
60|$|Repeating my {{inquiries}} at the <b>head</b> office <b>on</b> <b>my</b> arrival, I {{was referred to}} one of the partners in the firm. He spoke English perfectly; and he received me with an appearance of interest which I was at a loss to account for at first.|$|R
6000|$|... "That 's over now," [...] said Gordon. [...] "I came {{to welcome}} you back. It seemed to me I could n't lay my <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pillow without {{speaking}} to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Sir Patrick! As a Christian woman, {{that is not}} my way {{of looking}} at it. This unhappy person has lived under my roof. This unhappy person has been the {{companion}} of Blanche. I am responsible--I am, in a manner, morally responsible. I would give the world to be able to dismiss it as you do. But no! I must be satisfied that she is married. In the interests of propriety. For the quieting of my own conscience. Before I lay my <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pillow to-night, Sir Patrick--before I lay my <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> pillow to-night!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Bade Prudence good-bye at the docks," [...] {{continued}} Mr. Catesby, dreamily. [...] "You drew {{me behind}} {{a pile of}} luggage, Prudence, and put your <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. I have thought of it ever since." ...|$|E
60|$|But at length, {{after more}} entreaty and self-abasement <b>on</b> <b>my</b> part, {{she opened the}} door. The room was dark. We sat down {{together}} on the window-seat, {{and all at once}} she relaxed and her <b>head</b> fell <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder, and she began weeping again. I held her, the alternating moods still running through me.|$|R
60|$|She {{dropped her}} <b>head</b> dejectedly <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. My anger {{vanished}} atthose sad words; love only remained--love mingled with profoundest compassion and remorse {{for the pain}} I had inflicted. Supporting her with my arm, I tenderly stroked her dark hair, and, stooping, pressed my lips against it.|$|R
60|$|March 13th. It is all over. A {{week ago}} her <b>head</b> rested <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom. It is {{laid in the}} churchyard now; the fresh earth lies heavy over her grave. I and my dearest friend, the sister of my love, are parted in this world forever.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is myself--it is your friend--your nurse--your---- Lean your <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulder. Collect yourself." [...] In a lower tone--"O God, take pity! Give her life, and me strength! Send me courage! Teach me words!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{surely a}} British general--" [...] they would persist. [...] "Who's a British general?" [...] I would retort, [...] "I am {{talking to you}} merely as a plain commonsense man, with a <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All nonsense!" [...] {{returned}} the wood-chopper. [...] "I am only {{a poor man}} with the King's <b>head</b> <b>on</b> <b>my</b> shoulders. You can easily see it isn't mine, for it's crooked; the Dragon didn't glue it on straight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{came on a}} {{visit to}} a friend who {{happened}} to be out when I arrived. I found a pleasant fire here, and I sat down to warm myself.

60|$|My last {{remaining}} strength slipped from me, and <b>my</b> <b>head</b> fell forward <b>on</b> <b>my</b> chest. I think {{he found a}} certain satisfaction in giving me brandy.|$|R
60|$|I placed {{myself on}} the low seat she led me to, and then, when she had coiled herself up on the cushions, with her arms still round my neck, and her <b>head</b> resting <b>on</b> <b>my</b> bosom, she breathed a long happy sigh, and dropped like a tired child to sleep.|$|R
