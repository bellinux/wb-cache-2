40|$|In {{this paper}} a point-force scheme was {{developed}} to simulate a particle laden flow under the effects of mixed convection while the hydrodynamic removal of contaminants contained in a cavity was studied. The process of <b>fluid</b> <b>renewal</b> in a cavity was modeled using a Lattice Boltzmann method coupled with a double population scheme of energy evolution. Point-particle formulation accounts for the finite-size dispersed phase and the forces acting on the particles were modeled through drag force correlations. Two-way interaction of solid-fluid calculation was considered by adding an external force term for feedback forcing of particles in the fluid distribution function evolution. This study focused {{on the effects of}} mixed convection on the transient development of a cavity flow and the efficiency of the cleaning process. The results illustrate that the variations in the Grashof number made a remarkable difference in the observed flow pattern and cleaning efficiency...|$|E
40|$|The present paper enlightens a {{new point}} of view on brain {{homeostasis}} and communication, namely how the brain takes advantage of different chemical-physical phenomena such as pressure waves, and temperature and concentration gradients to allow the renewal of the extra-cellular fluid (i. e., the homeostasis of the brain internal milieu) as well as some forms of intercellular communications (Volume Transmission) at an energy cost much lower than the classical synaptic transmission (the prototype of Wiring Transmission). In particular, the possible functional meaning of the intracranial pressure waves is discussed in the frame of the so called tide hypothesis which maintains that the pressure waves, created by the cardiac pump, modulate the cerebro-spinal fluid flow from and towards the subarachnoid space as well as towards and from the Virchow-Robin spaces. These fluid push-pull movements favor both the migration of signals and the extra-cellular <b>fluid</b> <b>renewal,</b> especially in the cerebral cortex...|$|E
40|$|In this article, particle-laden flow in {{a channel}} with heated cavity has been investigated. Calculations were {{performed}} using a point force scheme for particle dynamics, while {{the process of}} <b>fluid</b> <b>renewal</b> was modeled using the double-population thermal lattice Boltzmann method. Point-particle formulation accounts for the finite-size dispersed phase and the forces acting on the particles were modeled through drag force correlations. Two-way interactions of solid-fluid calculation were considered by adding an external force term for feedback that forced particles {{in the evolution of}} fluid distribution function. The method was first validated with steady state flow in a channel with cavity in the presence and absence of a heat source. It was then applied to mixed convection flow laden with particles at various Grashof numbers. The particle dispersion characteristics were examined in detail, where the particle removal rate from cavity upon cavity aspect ratio was emphasized. The effect of the Reynolds number on particle distribution was further investigated numerically by varying the speed of inlet flow into the channel...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} switched queueing networks {{with a mix}} of heavy-tailed (i. e., arrival processes with infinite variance) and exponential-type {{traffic and}} study the delay performance of the Max-Weight/Back-Pressure policy, known for its throughput optimality and asymptotic delay optimality properties. Our focus is on the impact of heavy-tailed traffic on exponential-type queues/flows, which may manifest itself in the form of subtle rate-dependent phenomena. We introduce a novel class of Lyapunov functions (piecewise linear and nonincreasing in the length of heavy-tailed queues) whose drift analysis, combined with results in [28], can provide expo-nentially decaying upper bounds to queue-length tail asymptotics despite the presence of heavy tails. To facilitate a drift analysis we employ fluid approximations, proving that if a continuous and piecewise linear function is also a “Lyapunov function ” for the fluid model, then the same function is a “Lyapunov function ” for the original stochastic system. Furthermore, we use <b>fluid</b> approximations and <b>renewal</b> theory in order to prove delay instability results, i. e., infinite ex-pected delays in steady state. We illustrate the benefits of the proposed approach in two ways: (i) analytically, by studying the delay stability regions of switched queueing networks with dis...|$|R
40|$|Vaginal drug {{administration}} is a challenging approach {{due to the}} body´s natural defense mechanisms and specificity in formulation design. However, where applicable, topical drug delivery is preferable to systemic therapy. Firstly, it allows averting hepatic first pass effect and degradation by GI enzymes. Secondly, non-invasive application provides closer and {{direct contact with the}} affected area and relieves user from an unpleasant procedure. The aim of this project was development and optimization of mucus-penetrating liposomes for vaginal treatment of human papilloma virus (HPV). The naturally occurring protein interferon α- 2 b (IFN α- 2 b) is commonly used in treatment of vaginal infections. Due to continuous vaginal <b>fluid</b> <b>renewal</b> the residence time of mucoadhesive nanoparticles is shown to be insufficient. Treatment efficacy can be increased by designing novel, mucus-penetrating particles. To overcome the mucosal barrier, surface modification with the low molecular weight polymer polyethylene glycol (PEG), was applied. PEGylated liposomes containing IFN α- 2 b were prepared by thin film hydration method. Vesicle size was reduced by extrusion through polycarbonate membranes. Liposomal size, polydispersity, surface charge and IFN α- 2 b entrapment were determined. An adequate vesicle size (185 ± 3 nm) was obtained and a low polydispersity (PI 0. 09) indicated a monodisperse size distribution. Net surface charge was measured to be - 12. 2 ± 1. 4 mV. Free drug was separated from liposomally encapsulated IFN α- 2 b by gel column chromatography, and entrapment efficiency (88 %) was determined using human IFN α ELISA kit. The newly developed system for local IFN α- 2 b delivery has a potential to treat HPV infections...|$|E
