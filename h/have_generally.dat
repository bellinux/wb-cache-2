5|$|An antipope is a {{historical}} papal claimant not recognized as legitimate by the Roman Catholic Church. Unlike papal tombs, the tombs of antipopes <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> not been preserved, with a few notable exceptions.|$|E
5|$|Historically, {{competitive}} devaluations {{have been}} rare as countries <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> preferred {{to maintain a}} high value for their currency. Countries <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> allowed market forces to work, or have participated in systems of managed exchanges rates. An exception occurred when a currency war {{broke out in the}} 1930s when countries abandoned the gold standard during the Great Depression and used currency devaluations in an attempt to stimulate their economies. Since this effectively pushes unemployment overseas, trading partners quickly retaliated with their own devaluations. The period is considered to have been an adverse situation for all concerned, as unpredictable changes in exchange rates reduced overall international trade.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{speculative}} fiction {{on television}} and film has lagged behind literature in its portrayals of homosexuality. Sexual relationships in major speculative fiction franchises <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> been depicted as heterosexual in nature. Inter-species and inter-ethnic relationships have been commonly depicted, while homosexual relationships and transgender characters are more rare.|$|E

5|$|Against Neaera is {{preserved}} as Demosthenes' fifty-ninth speech, {{though it has}} been thought inauthentic since antiquity. Dionysius of Hallicarnassus, for instance, questioned its authorship. Modern scholars from the nineteenth century to the present <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> accepted that the speech was not written by Demosthenes, and today it is often grouped {{with the rest of}} the speeches concerning Apollodoros as being the work of a single Pseudo-Demosthenes. This author has been identified as Apollodoros himself by various scholars, including Kapparis in his commentary on the speech.|$|E
5|$|Amphidromus {{species are}} {{arboreal}} land snails. Further {{information concerning the}} habits and mode of life of the species of Amphidromus is almost non-existent, however, these snails <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> been collected while they were crawling on trees or shrubs. The diet of Amphidromus is unknown, but Amphidromus atricallosus perakensis is thought to feed on microscopic fungi, lichens or terrestrial algae.|$|E

5|$|Archaea and {{bacteria}} <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> similar cell structure, but cell composition and organization set the archaea apart. Like bacteria, archaea lack interior membranes and organelles. Like bacteria, the cell membranes of archaea are usually bounded by a cell wall and they swim using {{one or more}} flagella. Structurally, archaea are most similar to gram-positive bacteria. Most have a single plasma membrane and cell wall, and lack a periplasmic space; the exception to this general rule is Ignicoccus, which possess a particularly large periplasm that contains membrane-bound vesicles and is enclosed by an outer membrane.|$|E

5|$|Filmed over {{a period}} of two months after nearly three years of research, The Mirror Never Lies was {{sponsored}} in part by the Indonesian branch of the World Wide Fund for Nature and the Wakatobi regency government. The first feature film to star the Bajau, it used their language extensively. Although a commercial failure domestically, it has been screened at many international film festivals and won several awards both inside and outside of Indonesia. Critical reviews <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> been positive, mostly emphasising the film's visuals.|$|E

5|$|Governors who had {{previously}} been legislators <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.|$|E
5|$|Lesbians in Western {{cultures}} in particular often classify themselves {{as having an}} identity that defines their individual sexuality, {{as well as their}} membership to a group that shares common traits. Women in many cultures throughout history have had sexual relations with other women, but they rarely were designated as {{part of a group of}} people based on who they had physical relations with. As women <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> been political minorities in Western cultures, the added medical designation of homosexuality has been cause for the development of a subcultural identity.|$|E
5|$|Massachusetts {{politics}} {{since the}} second half of the 20th century <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> been dominated by the Democratic Party, and the state has a reputation for being the most liberal state in the country. In 1974, Elaine Noble became the first openly lesbian or gay candidate elected to a state legislature in US history. The state housed the first openly gay member of the United States House of Representatives, Gerry Studds, in 1972 and in 2004, Massachusetts became the first state to allow same-sex marriage.|$|E

5|$|Reviewers <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> responded {{positively}} {{to the complexity}} of Gwen's character and Eve Myles' portrayal, though critics found fault with her more prosaic characterisation earlier on. Eve Myles' portrayal of Gwen has been cited as effective in both promoting the country of Wales and combating a perceived prejudice against the Welsh accent. Myles received a Welsh BAFTA for the first series of the show and was nominated for several other acting awards across each of Torchwoods four series'.|$|E
5|$|The coins were minted in August 1918, {{and were}} sold {{to the public for}} $1 each. All sold, though many were held by a bank until 1933, and the profits used to defray the cost of local centennial {{celebrations}} or to help those in need because of World War I. Later writers <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> admired the coin, considering it one of the more handsome American commemoratives. The coin is valued in the hundreds of dollars today, though exceptional specimens may trade for more.|$|E
5|$|The {{courses of}} the rivers Parrett, Somerset Axe, Brue and Cary {{run across the}} Somerset Levels and <b>have</b> <b>generally</b> been changed to improve the flow. The River Axe rises from Wookey Hole Caves, due to water {{draining}} into the ground at swallet holes {{on top of the}} Mendips. The river passes through Panborough Moor, Wedmore Moor, Ox Moor, Stoke Moor and Mark Moor and reaches the sea at Uphill (near Weston-super-Mare) on Bridgwater Bay.|$|E
