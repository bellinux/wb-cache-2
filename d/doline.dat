The two main ways that the moa bones were deposited in such sites were: 1. birds that entered the cave to nest or escape bad weather, and subsequently died in the cave; and 2. birds that fell into a vertical shaft and were unable to escape. Moa bones (and the bones of other extinct birds) have been found in caves throughout New Zealand, especially in the limestone/marble areas of northwest Nelson, Karamea, Waitomo, and Te Anau.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationships between}} the occurrence of epigeic moss assemblages in different grasslands and the microhabitats (pits, <b>dolines,</b> brooks and mounds) occurring in a karst, almost flat basin. The bryophytes tend to form specific synusiae in grassland communities that cover particular microhabitats differentiated on the basis of microtopography. Except for pits and mounds, all other microhabitats are clearly distinguishable in terms of bryophyte composition. The most discriminant species between the moss synusiae of <b>dolines,</b> brooks and pits are Drepanocladus aduncus, Fontinalis antipyretica and Polytrichum commune, respectively. The mounds have no differential species and are poorly distinguished from pits based only on the low cover of Polytrichum commune. A combined soil acidity-moisture gradient determined by both land microtopography and surface water runoff is responsible for the good compositional distinctiveness of <b>dolines</b> and brooks from pits and mounds. A relatively broad section of this gradient is occupied by the niche of Calliergonella cuspidata, which could be the indicator of a different synusia occurring in microhabitats with ecological conditions intermediate between <b>dolines</b> and brooks. A weaker gradient of soil organic matter content accounts for the distinction of pits from <b>dolines</b> and brooks in the species multidimensional space. Overall, there is a good Agreement between the structure of epigeic bryophyte assemblages and the corresponding type of vascular plant communities developed in the same karst habitat, which supports the hypothesis of their dependence and the methodological approach of integrated releve´s in phytocoenosis sampling...|$|R

40|$|The central Ebro Basin {{comprises}} thick evaporite materials whose high solubility produces typically karstic landforms. The sinkhole morphology {{developed in}} the overlying alluvium has been studied using gravimetry and ground-penetrating radar (GPR) on stream terraces, {{as well as an}}alyzing the evolution of sinkhole morphologies observed in aerial photographs taken in 1928, 1957, and 1985. The sinkhole morphologies give some idea of possible subsurface processes as well as an indication of the final mechanisms involve in sinkhole development. On stream terraces and cover pediments the most commonly encountered <b>dolines</b> are bowl-shaped in their morphology with both diffuse and scarped edges. In contrast, <b>dolines</b> {{developed in the}} gypsiferous silt infilled valleys have a funnel and well-shaped morphology. The diffuse-edged bowl-shaped <b>dolines</b> are developed through the progressive subsidence of the alluvial cover, due to washing down of alluvial particles through small voids and cracks into deeper subsurface caves, resulting in a decrease alluvial density. Future compaction of the alluvial cover will produce surface subsidences. This type of <b>dolines</b> are associated with negative gravity anomalies. In contrast, the scarped-edge <b>dolines</b> are formed by the sudden collapse of a cavity roof. The cavities and cracks formed in the gypsum karst may migrate to the surface through the alluvial deposits by piping, and they may subsequently collapse. In this instance, the cavities can be detected by both gravity and GPR anomalies where the voids are not deeper than 4 – 5 m from the surface. These processes forming sinkholes can be enhanced by man-induced changes in the groundwater hydrologic regime by both inflows, due to irrigation, ditch losses, or pipe leakages, and by outflows from pumping activities.
