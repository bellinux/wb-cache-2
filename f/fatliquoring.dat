40|$|The {{deformation}} behaviour of chrome tanned {{crust leather}} (with or without <b>fatliquor)</b> and finished leather has been measured in three-point bend, tensile and compression tests. Relations between the experimental {{results and the}} perceived softness of the leather were investigated. The instrumentally assessed softness {{of a set of}} leathers was represented by parameters obtained from these tests and compared with a quantified subjective assessment. Differential Scanning Calorimetry (DSC) was used to analyse the water status in crust leathers. The influence of water content prior to staking on its softening effect was investigated. An orthogonal experiment was applied to investigate the influence of various factors (e. g. amplitude and frequency) on the softening effect of mechanical action to obtain an optimum combination of these factors. The bending force, F, increased in a linear way with increasing sample width, w, in accordance with the standard theory of beam bending. However the change in F with increasing sample thickness, t, departed (markedly in some cases) from the standard theory. The theory of laminated materials offered a quantitative description of the dependency provided that the grain and corium layers were regarded as the laminae. F was approximately proportional to the actual bending length raised to a power between - 2 and - 3. An empirical equation {{based on the results of}} the bend testing was developed. A parameter, Se/tn, can be used to rank the softness of leather, where Se is equivalent to the bending stiffness in standard bending theory, and n is the approximate index in the power function describing the relationship of the bending force F to the sample thickness t for a particular type of leather. A model describing the compression behaviour of crust leather is proposed which involves four stages of compression: (i) hair-like fibres being bent flat onto the surface and buckling of vertical fibre bundles, (ii) closing up of voids between fibre bundles, (iii) closing up of voids between fibres, and (iv) compressing of solid fibres. DSC results indicate that water has a stronger interaction with collagen molecules in an unfatliquored leather than in a <b>fatliquored</b> one. <b>Fatliquor</b> appears to function as a shield between water and collagen. The influence of water content prior to staking on the resulting softening effect was clearly reflected in bending and tensile tests, but was not nearly so evident in a compression test.

40|$|Chrome tanned {{bovine leather}} {{comprises}} two principal strata, the grain and the corium. The tensile strength and specific work of fracture {{of these two}} materials was investigated using uniaxial tensile tests and trouser tear tests respectively. Corium material was observed to be intrinsically stronger and tougher than grain material. The greater resistance of corium material to fracture is attributed to the processes of fibre debonding and pull out. The viscoelastic nature of grain and corium material was investigated by examining differences in strength and toughness over a range of deformation rates. The ultimate tensile properties and the specific work of fracture of both grain and corium material are rate dependent. Energy dissipation during a strain cycle was measured over a range of strain rates and strain levels to determine the bulk hysteresis of grain and corium specimens. The influences of specimen orientation and <b>fatliquor</b> (oil) on strength and toughness are also considered. The notch sensitivity of grain and corium materials has been scrutinised. Corium material is highly notch insensitive, whereas the fracture of grain material is notably sensitive {{to the presence of}} notches. The mechanism of fibre orientation and the phenomenon of fibre independence (or fibre autonomy) are responsible for the notch insensitive fracture behaviour of corium material. Strain distribution was measured in grain and corium single edge notch specimens. The radius of curvature of the notch was assessed throughout deformation / fracture and local strains at two dimensional levels were measured. Local strains ahead of the advancing crack and the radius of curvature of the crack are considerably higher with corium specimens than with grain specimens...|$|R

A reference transmission cell (100 mum) method was developed based {{on the use of}} a unique TPPO absorption at 542 cm- 1. This method covered PV values from 0 [...] 15 PV and was shown to be superior in accuracy and reproducibility to the standard American Oil Chemists Society (AOCS) iodometric method. Subsequently, the utility of disposable polyethylene cards, normally used only for qualitative analyses, was investigated for quantitative PV determination. A quantitative IR card method was successfully developed and shown to serve as a very simple, rapid and alternative means of carrying out PV analyses. TPP-impregnated cards were able to reproduce the transmission cell PV results to +/- 1. 12 PV, while the unimpregnated card was slightly more accurate (+/- 0. 92 PV). A third FTIR-PV method was developed specifically for the at-line monitoring of high PV <b>fatliquors</b> and employed a germanium attenuated total reflectance sample handling accessory. This method hinged on the use of a TPPO absorption band at 1118 cm- 1, normally off scale when pathlengths of > 3 mum are used, but is suited to the analysis of oils having very high PVs (> 250). The successful quantitative use of the disposable polyethylene IR card to PV led to its study for the quantitative FTIR determination of the isolated trans content of fats and oils and margarines.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} effect of some {{parameters}} on the breaking strain, strength and {{the shape of the}} stress-strain curve of bovine leather as revealed by uniaxial tensile tests. The parameters explored are <b>fatliquoring,</b> moisture content, strain rate and cyclic stressing. A basic mechanical model of a simple two-dimensional weave is created and used to describe {{the effect of}} such a weave on the shape of the stress-strain curve. It is found that <b>fatliquoring</b> lubricates and opens up the fibre structure and thereby makes the weave more extensible. The increase in the extensibility depends on the direction in which samples are cut and therefore {{the manner in which the}} fibres are orientated. Patliquoring is observed to increase the degree to which fibres pull out at break. There are indications that the strength of fatliquored leather decreases with time of storage, while the extensibility increases. The effect of the strain rate on the breaking strain, the tensile strength and the shape of the stress-strain curve is not very clear. The stressing and releasing leather decreases the strength of leather when the fibres are orientated preferentially along the direction of the applied stresses, but has an insignificant effect in the transverse direction. It is concluded that the degree of lubrication in a weave and the orientation of the fibre bundles significantly influence the performance of leather in a test. Both moisture and <b>fatliquoring</b> lubricate the weave. In both the cases the degree of fibre adhesions in a weave is decreased. A well lubricated weave allows its constituent fibres to slide and align along the direction of the applied stresses, and this tends to occur before the fibres themselves areextended. Cyclic testing, at low strains, ruptures fibre adhesions and as a result induces permanent set and makes a hide softer. Most of the work done in breaking the fibre adhesion is done in the first cycle. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{ultrasound}} (38 kHz, 1. 3 W cm- 2) on the dyeing, <b>fatliquoring</b> and tanning of leather {{have been investigated}} and the mechanisms whereby ultrasound influences these processes were elucidated.;Compared with a conventional process, ultrasonic dyeing can either shorten the dyeing time by 40 - 70 % or facilitate low temperature dyeing. This remarkable enhancing effect has been attributed mainly to an increased diffusion coefficient (D) of dyestuff {{in the presence of}} ultrasound. It was found that sonication is more effective in the initial phases than in the late phases of the dyeing process.;Application of ultrasound during the <b>fatliquoring</b> process or simply in the preparation of fatliquors resulted in an increase of leather fat contents (up to 40 %), especially in the inner corium layer, indicating an improved penetration. This can be partly attributed to a reduction of particle size by 20 - 30 %. In contrast to dyeing, ultrasound was found to be more effective later rather than earlier in the <b>fatliquoring</b> process.;Chromium and aldehyde tanning processes were accelerated only marginally (âˆ¼ 10 %) but the mimosa tanning process was speeded up significantly (by up to 100 %) by using ultrasound. Leathers tanned in the presence of ultrasound had shrinkage temperatures 3 - 5 Â°C higher than conventionally processed controls. A more even chromium distribution and less chromium leaching were obtained after using ultrasound. The results showed that ultrasound can increase the dispersion rate and the available tannin content (by 7 %) of mimosa, as well as reducing its particle size by 50 %. It was also found that ultrasonic treatment can prevent mould from growing on mimosa tanned leathers.;It is concluded that ultrasound is more effective in a process which involves a colloidal rather than a true solution system. The prevailing effects of ultrasound on the former processes are to increase the diffusion coefficient and reduce the aggregation. This is due to cavitation. ...|$|E

Wet multifunctional materials were obtained and tested for wet finishing of hides with retanning, <b>fatliquoring</b> and dyeing properties reduction of sulphates in the effluents from compact retanning was min. 45 % and reduction of chloride 50 %, chromium salts from effluents are completely reduced in the case of compact FOC (free of chrome) leather, reduction of ash content in the effluents from compact retanning was min. 40 %. The leather wet finishing with newly multifunctional materials gave comparable physical properties to classical retanning. The economic effects to applying compact materials and technologies of bovine leather wet finishing are significant and refer to reducing processing time by 45 %, water consumption by 30 %, labour by 40 %, auxiliary materials by 30 %...|$|E
40|$|The leather {{industry}} employs {{large amounts of}} water in unit operations of the tanning process which occurs in an aqueous medium. Identify strategies to minimize the quantity of water used in the wet stages of the leather processing is {{necessary in order to}} increase the sustainability of this compartment. In the present work, an integrated pilot scale membrane system (membrane bioreactor unit (MBR) coupled to nanofiltration (NF)) was developed for municipal wastewater reclamation. Its performance was evaluated and designed to meet the water quality criteria in view of its reuse in the tanning process. The feasibility of using reclaimed wastewater in the different wet phases of the tanning process (beamhouse, tanning, re-tanning, dyeing, <b>fatliquoring)</b> for manufacturing of calf skins was investigated on pilot scale. The results showed that the combination of MBR and NF treatments applied to municipal wastewaters is adequate for recovering water with low hardness, very low Fe, Mn and ammonium levels as required by tanneries. The pilot-scale tests demonstrated the technical feasibility of using the reclaimed water in the tanning process. The wet-blue leathers produced with treated water and with softened tap water did not show any considerable differences in terms of physical and sensorial properties and their quality fully satisfied the tannery specifications. The results indicate the use of treated municipal wastewater can be considered a promising solution to reduce the groundwater depletion...|$|E
40|$|The {{vegetable}} tannins are {{the oldest}} tanning agents used in leather industry. They give their natural character and colour to the leathers {{which they are}} applied to, but they have the disadvantage of colour change when {{they are exposed to}} light for prolonged times. In this study light fastness properties of leathers tanned with mimosa, quebracho, valonea and chestnut tannins were measured. Lightfastness properties of mimosa and quebracho tannins were found lower. Then these tannins were modified with sulphitation, novalac synthesis and sulphomethylation processes. Lightfastness and determination of volatile matter, determination of matter soluble in dichloromethane, determination of sulphated total ash and sulphated water-insoluble ash, determination of water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, determination of nitrogen content and hide substance, calculation of degree of tannage determination of formaldehyde content analyses were performed to the leathers tanned with modified mimosa and quebracho tannins. From comparison of results, it was understood that sulpmethylation process can be used for production of leathers with higher lightfastness and without major change on chemical properties. When chemical properties of leathers tanned with modified quebracho and mimosa are considered: volatile matter, sulphated total ash and sulphated water- insoluble ash, water soluble matter, water soluble inorganic matter and water soluble organic matter, hide substance and formaldehyde contents were found compatible with standard mimosa and quebracho. However degree of tannage and matter soluble in dichloromethane values were found lower, which means some enhancements in modification or <b>fatliquoring</b> process should be considered. ...|$|E
