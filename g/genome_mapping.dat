This method includes the irradiation of cells {{to disrupt the}} genome into the desired number of fragments that are subsequently fused with Chinese hamster cells. The resulting somatic cell hybrids contain individual fragments of the relevant genome. Then, 90–100 (sometimes, more) clones covering the total genome are selected, and the sequences of interest are localized on the cloned fragments via the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or direct DNA–DNA hybridization. To compare the genomes and chromosomes of two species, RHs should be obtained for both species.|$|E

40|$|A <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> is an {{ordering}} {{of a set}} of clones according to their believed position on a DNA string. Simple heuristics for <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> assembly based on single restriction enzyme with complete digestion data can lead to inaccuracies and ambiguities. This paper presents a method that adds additional constraint checking to the assembly process. An automaton is presented that for any <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> produces a refined <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> where both the clones and the restriction fragments in each clone are ordered satisfying natural constraints called step constraints. Any <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> that cannot be refined is highly likely to be inaccurate and can be eliminated as a possibility. 1 Introduction Deoxyribonucleic acid or DNA, the genetic material that encodes the blueprint of any living organism, is composed of a string of nucleotides that are adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). Clones are copies of random substrings of a given DNA string. Clones may overlap in a clone database. Res [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Originally, {{data was}} simply passed one-way from a central {{processing}} unit (CPU) to a graphics processing unit (GPU), then to a display device. However, as time progressed, it became valuable for GPUs to store at first simple, then complex structures of data to be passed back to the CPU that analyzed an image, or a set of scientific-data represented as a 2D or 3D format that a video card can understand. Because the GPU has access to every draw operation, it can analyze data in these forms quickly, whereas a CPU must poll every pixel or data element much more slowly, as the speed of access between a CPU and its larger pool of random-access memory (or in an even worse case, a hard drive) is slower than GPUs and video cards, which typically contain smaller amounts of more expensive memory that is much faster to access. Transferring {{the portion of the}} data set to be actively analyzed to that GPU memory in the form of textures or other easily readable GPU forms results in speed increase. The distinguishing feature of a GPGPU design is the ability to transfer information bidirectionally back from the GPU to the CPU; generally the data throughput in both directions is ideally high, resulting in a multiplier effect on the speed of a specific high-use algorithm. GPGPU pipelines may improve efficiency on especially large data sets and/or data containing 2D or 3D imagery. It is used in complex graphics pipelines as well as scientific computing; more so in fields with large data sets like <b>genome</b> <b>mapping,</b> or where two- or three-dimensional analysis is useful especially at present biomolecule analysis, protein study, and other complex organic chemistry. Such pipelines can also vastly improve efficiency in image processing and computer vision, among other fields; as well as parallel processing generally. Some very heavily optimized pipelines have yielded speed increases of several hundred times the original CPU-based pipeline on one high-use task.|$|E

The university president, John Jenkins, described his hope that Notre Dame would become [...] "one of the pre–eminent research {{institutions in the}} world" [...] in his inaugural address. The university has many multi-disciplinary institutes devoted to research in varying fields, including the Medieval Institute, the Kellogg Institute for International Studies, the Kroc Institute for International Peace studies, and the Center for Social Concerns. Recent research includes work on family conflict and child development, <b>genome</b> <b>mapping,</b> the increasing trade deficit of the United States with China, studies in fluid mechanics, computational science and engineering, and marketing trends on the Internet.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his seminal work on the amino acid sequence of insulin, Frederick Sanger and his colleagues {{played a key role}} in the development of DNA sequencing techniques that enabled the establishment of comprehensive genome sequencing projects. In 1975, he and Alan Coulson published a sequencing procedure using DNA polymerase with radiolabelled nucleotides that he called the Plus and Minus technique. This involved two closely related methods that generated short oligonucleotides with defined 3' termini. These could be fractionated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel (called polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) and visualised using autoradiography. The procedure could sequence up to 80 nucleotides in one go and was a big improvement, but was still very laborious. [...] Nevertheless, in 1977 his group was able to sequence most of the 5,386 nucleotides of the single-stranded bacteriophage φX174, completing the first fully sequenced DNA-based genome. The refinement of the Plus and Minus method resulted in the chain-termination, or Sanger method (see below), which formed the basis of the techniques of DNA sequencing, <b>genome</b> <b>mapping,</b> data storage, and bioinformatic analysis most widely used in the following quarter-century of research. In the same year Walter Gilbert and Allan Maxam of Harvard University independently developed the Maxam-Gilbert method (also known as the chemical method) of DNA sequencing, involving the preferential cleavage of DNA at known bases, a less efficient method. For their groundbreaking work in the sequencing of nucleic acids, Gilbert and Sanger shared half the 1980 Nobel Prize in chemistry with Paul Berg (recombinant DNA).|$|E

The objectives {{of this research}} were to: 1) populate the framework buffelgrass <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> with additional molecular markers, 2) develop polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based markers from selected, informative {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} (RFLP) markers on the buffelgrass <b>genome</b> <b>map,</b> and 3) increase marker resolution near the locus conferring apomixis (PApo 1). Buffelgrass [Pennisetum ciliare (L.) Link syn. Cenchrus ciliaris L. ] (2 n= 4 x= 36), a highly polymorphic, apomictic, perennial forage grass, is well-suited for genetic linkage analyses. One hundred and seventy one probes from an apomictic, spikelet-specific, complementary deoxyribonucleic acid (cDNA) library and 70 expressed sequence tag simple sequence repeats (EST-SSRs) from apomictic pistil cDNAs were evaluated and added to the framework buffelgrass <b>genome</b> <b>map.</b> The improved linkage map contains 851 markers from 11 grass species and covers approximately 80 - 85 % of the buffelgrass genome. Two RFLPs from the buffelgrass <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> were converted to PCR-based markers for both the identification of hybrids and quantification of sexual versus apomictic reproduction. A gel-free, high-throughput technique was developed to analyze these markers directly in 96 -well plates. Five additional markers were placed onto the buffelgrass linkage group with the PApo 1 apomixis locus through comparative mapping of candidate orthologs from the sorghum <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> and bulked-segregant analysis of amplified-fragment-lengthpolymorphisms (BSA-AFLP). Increasing the mapping population size did not increase map resolution in the PApo 1 region. Association mapping revealed that the recombination suppression near PApo 1 is moderate and would complicate comparative map-based cloning efforts of the orthologous region in sorghum...|$|R

40|$|The DNA {{molecules}} {{packaged in}} structures called chromosomes within {{the cells of}} living organisms encode hereditary information that is passed on to their offspring. Using transcription and translation, the genes within these DNA molecules help in protein synthesis. Thus chromosomal DNA serves as a blueprint for the chemical processes of life. In order to analyze a DNA sequence by currently available technology, we have to cut it into small fragments, e. g. by using restriction enzymes. The application of different restriction enzymes to the multiple copies of the same DNA sequence generates many overlapping fragments. In order to construct the original DNA, these fragments need to be sequenced and assembled. This problem of finding the original order of the fragments is called the <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> assembly problem. This research proposes a constraint automaton solution to solve the <b>genome</b> <b>map</b> assembly problem for both error prone and error free data.
