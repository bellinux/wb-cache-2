5|$|The JD Power {{survey in}} 2011 {{announced}} the C3 Picasso {{as the best}} MPV on the market, with a satisfaction rating of 83.1% and five stars overall, but with the lowest rating given to the exterior quality at three stars.

50|$|Recently, {{there have}} been many issues raised by the {{residents}} residing on the Mount Mary Road in Bandra where the Fair takes place. Some residents <b>have</b> <b>complained</b> that all the public transport is reserved for pilgrims during the fair, leaving the nearby residents with no transport. Due to large scale cooking on the roads, some residents <b>have</b> <b>complained</b> of pollution, while many <b>have</b> <b>complained</b> that mosquitoes increase in number during the fair. Also, nearby dental clinics and dispensaries on Mount Mary Road prefer to remain closed during the fair.|$|R
5|$|The report {{made several}} recommendations, {{including}} {{the creation of}} a set of national principles emphasizing the minimum use of force at all times, and making the display of police ID a legal requirement. In February 2010 the Met announced that 8,000 of its officers had been issued with embroidered epaulettes, as several <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> that the numbers were falling off, rather than being removed deliberately.|$|E
5|$|Among {{his later}} works, {{following}} in his traditional sketches {{about his life}} and people he has met, were Hurry-Graphs (1851), Out-Doors at Idlewild (1854), and Ragbag (1855). Willis <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> that his magazine writing prevented him from writing a longer work. He finally had the time in 1856, and he wrote his only novel, Paul Fane, which was published a year later. The character Bosh Blivins, who served as comic relief in the novel, may {{have been based on}} painter Chester Harding. His final work was The Convalescent (1859), which included a chapter on his time spent with Washington Irving at Sunnyside.|$|E
5|$|Another of {{the early}} subwoofers was {{developed}} during the late 1960s by Ken Kreisel, {{the former president of}} the Miller & Kreisel Sound Corporation in Los Angeles. When Kreisel's business partner, Jonas Miller, who owned a high-end audio store in Los Angeles, told Kreisel that some purchasers of the store's high-end electrostatic speakers <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> about a lack of bass response in the electrostatics, Kreisel designed a powered woofer that would reproduce only those frequencies that were too low for the electrostatic speakers to convey. Infinity's full range electrostatic speaker system that was developed during the 1960s also used a woofer to cover the lower frequency range that its electrostatic arrays did not handle adequately.|$|E

5|$|Charles XI <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> {{of stomach}} pains since 1694. In {{the summer of}} 1696, he asked his doctors for an opinion on the pain as it had {{continuously}} become worse, {{but they had no}} viable cure or treatment for it. He continued to perform his duties as usual, but, in February 1697, the pains became too severe for him to cope and he returned to Stockholm where the doctors discovered he had a large, hard lump in his stomach. At this point there was little the doctors could do except alleviate the King's pain as best they could. Charles XI died on 5 April 1697, in his forty-first year. An autopsy showed that the King had developed cancer and that it had spread through his entire abdominal cavity.|$|E
5|$|Hogg {{moved from}} York to London {{in the spring}} of 1812 to study law. He tried to conceal his {{political}} views from his classmates and spent long hours studying law and reading Greek literature. In 1813 Hogg reconciled with the Shelleys after they visited him in London. They remained in contact after the couple left on a journey to Wales and Ireland. In April 1814, Hogg went to Ireland in an attempt to cheer up Percy Shelley, who <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> of poor spirits in a letter. The Shelleys did not receive Hogg's last letter before he embarked on the journey and had left Dublin before he arrived. Unable to locate them, he returned home. Shelley soon travelled back to London as well.|$|E
5|$|On 15 November 2004, Shaftesbury's Nice-based lawyer, Thierry Bensaude {{reported}} him missing, {{after being}} contacted by his girlfriend, Orche. The peer divided {{his time between}} the Riviera and a home in Hove, East Sussex. He had been due to return home on 10 November. After not hearing from Shaftesbury in a week, they remained concerned when he failed {{to return to his}} rented flat in Adelaide Crescent, Hove. Bensaude and Orche both expressed fears for his safety. Shaftesbury had been taking legal action in relation to the theft of some family antiques and artwork. Some friends and acquaintances mentioned that he <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> of money problems, so they surmised that his disappearance may {{have had something to do}} with the theft and financial loss.|$|E

5|$|The Australians had {{continued}} to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly impatient with the Australian approach, in early 1967 the Commander US MACV, General William Westmoreland, <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach. However, the Australians were convinced that deliberate patrolling techniques were more effective in separating communist forces from {{the population in the}} villages while working towards slowly extending government control, and such urgings went largely unheeded.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{generated}} further {{controversy in}} September 2005, when Channel 4 in the United Kingdom decided to air the episode {{a week after}} Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans. Arguing that the episode was an insensitive choice, given recent events, several viewers filed complaints with Ofcom. Two days later, Channel 4 apologized on-air and directly contacted all those who <b>had</b> <b>complained.</b> Channel 4 had screened the episode for offensive content, but the reviews focused on the main content of the episode, and the song was not considered {{a key part of}} the plot. Channel 4 promised to update their review process to ensure that similar incidents would not occur. The New Orleans song was edited out of all future showings, and remains absent from all Channel 4 airings as of March 2017.|$|E
5|$|Arkane were {{influenced}} by some criticisms of the first Dishonored. Although the difficulty was not considered a major problem, a sizeable number of players <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> the first was too easy, and thus the harder difficulty settings were reworked. The chaos system of Dishonored, considered as merely a binary ersatz meter, was intended more depth in the sequel. The altered chaos system, where different individuals grant varying amounts of chaos, was implemented due to how many players used the Heart in the original game. As the Heart would reveal secrets about whomever it was pointed at, players would use it to decide which NPCs to kill and which to leave be or spare. Also intended to yield additional improvements was the upgrade system, which would {{for the first time}} level up based on a skill tree. Bonecharms were made into craftable items, with 400,000 possible combinations available. While taking into account the intricacies of how supernatural abilities would be used, designers faced increased difficulty in relation to the play-style where the game is traversed in their absence, noting the accommodation of the play-style {{in a way that would}} not cancel out the other as a challenge.|$|E

5|$|In May 1945, all German {{troops in}} Norway {{came under the}} command of the Twentieth Mountain Army, which had absorbed the Army Norway on 18 December 1944. It was {{commanded}} by General Franz Böhme, who had succeeded General Lothar Rendulic as Armed Forces Commander, Norway in January 1945. At the beginning of May, Böhme informed Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz, Commander-in-Chief of the Naval High Command and the new German president, with the death of Adolf Hitler, that all forces in Norway consisted of eleven divisions and five brigades. In total, they had a combined strength of between 350,000 and 380,000 troops. There were also a number of U-boats stationed in naval bases in Norway, including 10 Mark XXI and 17 Mark XXIII models. Yet although Allied forces had entered Germany, and rumours and speculation were rife about a possible invasion of Norway, the Twentieth Mountain Army almost seemed to be at a peace-time status; Böhme <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> in January that there were some units in the Army that took Sunday off as a holiday, and that he could do little to stop it.|$|E
5|$|The Australians {{considered}} the operation a complete success and its results were largely seen to vindicate their evolving tactics, techniques and procedures. In the following months 5 RAR continued to develop cordon and search procedures as 1 ATF attempted {{to extend its}} influence, with such operations proving significant in weakening the Viet Cong infrastructure and removing a number of villages from their control. In this manner the Australians had continued to operate independently within Phuoc Tuy province, and while the war had become a series of big unit search and destroy operations in a war of attrition for the Americans, they had pursued their own counter-insurgency campaign. Regardless, differences of opinion between Australian and American methods had produced friction, and increasingly impatient with the Australian approach, in early-1967 the Commander US Military Assistance Command Vietnam, General William Westmoreland, <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> to the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam, Major General Tim Vincent, demanding a more aggressive approach.

5|$|While {{most of the}} {{employees}} are congregated in the pool area, Robert gives some of the male employees a tour of his massive home, spending {{most of the time}} mournfully describing how it was intended to be the location for wild, uninhibited parties. He offers those present on the tour a free bottle of wine from his wine cellar and the staff proceed to get drunk. Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) had intended to make a token appearance at Robert's party and quickly return home to his wife and kids; however, Robert, sensing his reluctance to be there, insists that Jim stay {{for the duration of the}} tour in order to punish him for laughing at an inopportune moment earlier that day as Robert <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> about having to sell his house. Eventually, Robert realizes that he is hosting one of the parties he had always imagined, at which point he jumps into the pool completely naked, followed by Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods) and Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), who had both been battling all night to impress him. Jim takes this as his cue to leave, sneaking away and driving home at top speed. At the end of the night, Gabe and Ryan, both drunk and unwilling to concede defeat in their brown-nosing battle, remain at the party with Robert even as the CEO passes out.|$|E

50|$|Spøgelsesjægerne has {{received}} criticism for not focusing {{enough on the}} two groups' paranormal investigations and too much on their private lives, and their eating habits, and several viewers <b>have</b> <b>complained</b> on Kanal 5's Facebook page. Followers {{of the two groups}} <b>have</b> <b>complained,</b> not only that there is not enough ghost hunting, but also that the show deliberately ridicules the two groups and deliberately depicts them as amateurs.|$|R
5|$|Regarding Hall's fate, the {{official}} investigation that followed ruled {{the cause of}} death was apoplexy (an early term for stroke). Some of Hall's symptoms— partial paralysis, slurred speech, delirium— certainly fit that diagnosis. Indeed, the pains that Hall complained about down one side of his body, which he attributed to many years' huddling in an igloo, may have been due to a previous minor stroke. However, in 1968, Hall's biographer Chauncey C. Loomis, a professor at Dartmouth College, made an expedition to Greenland to exhume Hall's body. Because of the permafrost, Hall's body, flag shroud, clothing and coffin were remarkably well-preserved. Tests on tissue samples of bone, fingernails and hair showed that Hall had received large doses of arsenic in the last two weeks of his life. Arsenic poisoning appears consistent with the symptoms party members reported: stomach pains, vomiting, stupor, and mania. Arsenic can have a sweet taste, and Hall <b>had</b> <b>complained</b> that the coffee had tasted too sweet, and had burned his stomach. It also appears that at least three of the crew, Budington, Meyer, and Bessels, expressed relief at Hall's death and said that the expedition would be better off without him. In his book The Arctic Grail, Pierre Berton suggests that it is possible that Hall accidentally dosed himself with the poison, as arsenic was common in medical kits of the time. But it is considered more probable that he was murdered by one of the other members of the expedition, possibly Bessels, who was in nearly constant attendance of Hall. No charges were ever filed.|$|E
