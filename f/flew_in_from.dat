5|$|Richards' {{addiction}} to heroin delayed {{his arrival in}} Toronto; the other members had already arrived, waiting for him, and sent him a telegram asking him where he was. On 24 February 1977, when Richards and his family <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> London, they were temporarily detained by Canada Customs after Richards was found {{in possession of a}} burnt spoon and hash residue. Three days later, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, armed with an arrest warrant for Pallenberg, discovered 22 grams of heroin in Richards' room. Richards was charged with importing narcotics into Canada, an offence that carried a minimum seven-year sentence.|$|E
5|$|After {{her return}} to Japan, Hōshō was {{transferred}} to the Third Fleet, unofficially assigned to the training fleet (later called the Mobile Force Training Force), and officially assigned in October. She conducted flight training in the Inland Sea for aircraft that <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> shore bases, since no aircraft were based on board Hōshō. On 15 January 1943, the 50th Air Flotilla was created for carrier aircrew training and both Hōshō and Ryūhō were assigned to the new unit. The two ships provided carrier landing training and served as target ships for torpedo training. In January 1944, Hōshō was reassigned to the 12th Air Fleet, then to the Combined Fleet, but continued to perform the same mission of training fleet carrier pilots in the Inland Sea. In this role, Hōshō shuttled back and forth between Kure and the Western Inland Sea, spending equal amounts of time at each location.|$|E

5|$|In June 1982, Genesis {{released}} the double live album Three Sides Live {{in two different}} versions. The North American edition contains three sides of live recordings with the fourth comprising the 3×3 tracks and two from the Duke sessions. The European release contains a fourth side of extra live tracks. The album coincided with the home video release of the Three Sides Live concert film recorded in 1981. A tour of North America and Europe followed that ran from August to September 1982, featuring guest appearances from Bill Bruford and the Phenix Horns. On 2 October, Genesis headlined a one-off concert with Gabriel at the Milton Keynes Bowl under the name Six of the Best. The concert was organised {{to raise money for}} Gabriel's World of Music, Arts and Dance project which was, by that point, in considerable debt. Hackett, who <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> abroad, arrived in time to perform the last two songs.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{a number}} of notable people used Saint-Inglevert Airfield. King Edward VIII made three visits, the first on 4 February 1935, while still the Prince of Wales, when he arrived from Fort Belvedere, Surrey on {{the first part of}} a journey to take a holiday at Kitzbühel, Austria. As king, he {{departed}} on 26 July 1936 to RAF Hendon on his return from the ceremony to unveil the Canadian National Vimy Memorial, and <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> the Great West Aerodrome, Harmondsworth, UK on 8 August, in order to catch the Orient Express at Calais, as part of a holiday in Yugoslavia. Henri Mignet flew from Saint-Inglevert to Lympne on 13 August 1935, in his Flying Flea, then the world's smallest aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The first {{blood was}} shed deep in Malaysian territory, with the Indonesian-staged Brunei Revolt on 8 December 1962. This operation, {{with the goal}} of seizing the oilfields as well as European hostages, was swiftly crushed by British forces that <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Singapore. The {{conflict}} proper, however, began in April of the following year, as 'volunteer' Indonesian forces made occasional raids across the Sarawak border. These raids were small, generally composed of groups smaller than platoon size, and their damage was minimised with relative ease by local security forces. The turning point came on 16 September, when the Malaysian Federation was formally created. In Indonesia, the response to the frustration of their plans to prevent the Federation's birth was serious and violent. A mob converged upon the British embassy in Jakarta, smashing windows and doors in protest. Sukarno authorised stronger raids by Indonesian regular forces, and even launched seaborne attacks into peninsular Malaysia. The raiding would continue {{for the duration of the}} conflict.|$|E

25|$|On August 7, 2007, {{a missile}} {{landed in the}} Georgian-controlled village of Tsitelubani, some 65km north of Tbilisi.

Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili said the incident was part of a pattern of Russian aggression against its neighbors and urged European states to condemn Moscow. Georgia claimed to have radar evidence proving that the invading aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Russia and said that the strike had aimed, unsuccessfully, at destroying radar equipment recently installed near the South Ossetian conflict zone.|$|E
25|$|Lee's {{body was}} flown to Jacksonville, North Carolina, where an autopsy was performed.

25|$|Georgian {{experts have}} {{identified}} the missile as a Soviet-designed Kh-58 ARM.

Georgia claimed to have radar evidence proving that the invading aircraft <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Russia and said that the strike had aimed, unsuccessfully, at destroying radar equipment recently installed near the South Ossetian conflict zone. The Georgian experts suggested the pilot did not fire but jettisoned the missile and fled after friendly forces of South Ossetia mistakenly fired an anti-aircraft missile at his jet.|$|E

25|$|The Royal Iraqi Air Force (RIrAF) {{considered}} {{its founding}} day as 22 April 1931, {{when the first}} pilots <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> training in the United Kingdom. Before {{the creation of the}} new air force, the RAF Iraq Command was in charge of all British Armed Forces elements in Iraq in the 1920s and early 1930s. The RIrAF was based at the airport in the Washash neighborhood of Baghdad, and consisted of five pilots, aeronautics students trained at the RAF College Cranwell, and 32 aircraft mechanics. The original five pilots were Natiq Mohammed Khalil al-Tay, Mohammed Ali Jawad, Hafdhi Aziz, Akrem Mushtaq, and Musa Ali. During {{the early years of the}} Royal Iraqi Air Force, it mainly received aircraft from the United Kingdom as well as Breda Ba.65 attack planes and SM-79 bombers from Italy.|$|E
25|$|The {{event was}} seen as a key step towards {{preparing}} China's athletes for the 2008 Summer Olympics. Xing Huina completed a double in the women's 5000 metres and 10,000 metres and would have had a third in the 1500 metres but she was disqualified for elbowing Liu Qing (who herself completed a double having won the 800 metres). The top two from the women's marathon – Sun Yingjie and Zhou Chunxiu – <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Beijing the day before the 10,000m but still managed second and third place, respectively. The result did not stand, however, as Sun failed a drugs test for androsterone. Her test at the Beijing Marathon the previous day was negative but, in spite of a civil court ruling a rival athlete had spiked her drink, she was disqualified and banned for two years.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 1954 Conacher was in Ottawa {{attending}} to his parliamentary duties {{when he was asked}} to play in the annual softball game between MPs and members of the parliamentary press gallery. On May 26, in the sixth inning, in his last at-bat-ever, he hit a long drive into left field, stretching a single into a triple, when he sprinted to third base. He stood, breathing heavily and then collapsed face-first from having been hit {{in the head with a}} pitch in an earlier inning. One of the other MPs was a doctor who tried to assist him, but there was little that could be done for Conacher and within twenty minutes he was pronounced dead. The next day Conacher was supposed to attend his daughter's graduation from the University of Toronto. A big funeral was held, and his brother Charlie <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> England to be there. He was buried at St. Johns York Mills Anglican Church Cemetery in Toronto.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough and walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard the laughter of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E
25|$|Special forces {{played a}} key role, with an Australian {{squadron}} from the Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), a troop from the New Zealand Special Air Service (NZSAS) and a troop from the British Special Boat Service (SBS) forming Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR flew into Dili by RAAF C-130H Hercules securing Komoro Airport followed by NZSAS and SBS. With the airhead secured, infantry from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (2 RAR) then <b>flew</b> <b>in</b> <b>from</b> Darwin supported by two M-113 armoured personnel carriers from B Squadron, 3rd/4th Cavalry Regiment. RESPFOR began vehicle patrols into Dili, including reconnaissance of Dili port, after which a rifle company from 2 RAR - borrowing Indonesian military trucks for transport - secured the port prior {{to the arrival of}} follow-on forces the next day, while the remainder of the battalion consolidated the position at Komoro. Meanwhile, an advance party of Gurkhas from the 2nd Battalion, The Royal Gurkha Rifles (2 RGR) and British Royal Marines Commandos from the Fleet Standby Rifle Troop (FSRT) secured the foothills and areas to the south of the city. 3rd Battalion, Royal Australian Regiment (3 RAR) began landing the next day at the port, along with the 2nd Cavalry Regiment equipped with ASLAV light armoured vehicles and the remainder of the Company Group from 2 RGR arrived. No. 2 Airfield Defence Squadron (2AFDS) arrived the following day to permanently secure Komoro airport replacing 2 RAR. Additional Australian forces and support personnel arrived {{in the days that followed}} as INTERFET continued to grow, as did forces from a number of other countries, in particular from New Zealand.|$|E
