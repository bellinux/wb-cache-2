5|$|Despite his {{contract}} with Sengoku, Mann went on to make his North American debut against Doug Evans on 11 September 2010 at Shark Fights 13. The bout saw Mann hit Evans with multiple combinations and low kicks, before utilising a flying knee. Evans counter-attacked with takedowns, which he <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> into the final round. Mann won the bout via split decision (47–48, 48–47, 48–47) to become the new Shark Fights Featherweight champion.|$|E
5|$|Igneous {{activity}} {{associated with}} this stretching occurred from 12million to 4million years ago.

60|$|Daybreak {{found the}} party again passing swiftly over the land. It really {{seemed as if}} even the boys had {{received}} special strength for the occasion, for they neither lagged behind nor murmured, but <b>kept</b> well <b>up</b> during the whole forced march. No doubt that youthful enthusiasm to which Captain Trench had referred <b>kept</b> Olly <b>up</b> to the mark, while Osky-- as his friend called him--had been inured to hard labour of every kind from infancy.|$|R

5|$|The British {{attacked}} {{the position of}} the 3rd Continentals, and an engagement ensued. Both sides <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> constant fire, the Americans breaking the British lines several times. However, after 17 volleys, the British numbers began to overwhelm the Americans, and Glover ordered a withdrawal to another stone wall on the crest of a hill while the next regiment in line, the 26th Continentals, engaged the British.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> {{resistance}} against the Spanish {{for a number}} of years but on 9 May 1530 the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds.

5|$|Despite the {{excitement}} surrounding Lester's and King's performances, the Americans did not fare well overall. Fifteen matches were played, {{but only two}} were won, while the team lost nine and earned a draw in four. The other win came against Warwickshire. During this match at Edgbaston, Lester scored 35 runs in the first innings and 67 in the second. Lester was the best batsmen on the Philadelphian side; beginning with 72 not out in his first match, he <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> his form all through the tour, scoring 891 runs for an average 37.12. Several counties offered him contracts to play in England.|$|E

5|$|Dow {{spent the}} early 1840s {{attending}} to his tanning business, but also {{found time to}} encourage individual drinkers to take up abstinence. In 1842, he and his allies succeeded in getting the city government in Portland to require licenses for liquor dealers and to prosecute unlicensed sellers; {{a referendum on the}} question was decided in the prohibitionists' favor later that year. The next year saw the Democrats win election to city government, replacing the more prohibition-friendly Whigs, and many liquor-sellers resumed their trade as prosecutions were deferred indefinitely. Dow <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> his speaking efforts around the state, despite once being assaulted by a man hired by a liquor dealer.|$|E
5|$|However, some popular depictors have strived for {{accuracy}} and presented up-to-date information; Michael Crichton and Bill Watterson (of Calvin and Hobbes) are two recent examples. Paleoartists and illustrators {{in particular have}} <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> with research. Popular conceptions of dinosaurs have also been important in stimulating the interest and imagination of young people, and {{have been responsible for}} introducing many who would later become paleontologists to the field. In addition, popular depictions have the freedom to be more imaginative and speculative than technical works.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, Volition {{released}} the source code {{for the game}} engine under a non-commercial license.

The improved game engine is also used by various mod projects, for example The Babylon Project and Diaspora which are based on the science fiction series Babylon 5 and Battlestar Galactica respectively.|$|E

5|$|In April 1770, Maria Theresa's {{youngest}} daughter, Maria Antonia, married Louis, Dauphin of France, {{by proxy}} in Vienna.

Maria Theresa <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> a fortnightly correspondence with Maria Antonia, now called Marie Antoinette, in which she often reproached her for laziness and frivolity and scolded her for failing to conceive a child.|$|E
5|$|Kepler's primary {{obligation}} as imperial mathematician {{was to provide}} astrological advice to the emperor. Though Kepler took {{a dim view of}} the attempts of contemporary astrologers to precisely predict the future or divine specific events, he had been casting well-received detailed horoscopes for friends, family, and patrons since his time as a student in Tübingen. In addition to horoscopes for allies and foreign leaders, the emperor sought Kepler's advice in times of political trouble. Rudolph was actively interested in the work of many of his court scholars (including numerous alchemists) and <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> with Kepler's work in physical astronomy as well.|$|E

5|$|One notable Dream Shake {{happened}} in Game 2 of the 1995 Western Conference Finals against the Spurs. With David Robinson guarding him, Olajuwon performed a cross-over, {{drove to the}} basket and faked a layup. Robinson, an excellent defender, <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> with Olajuwon and remained planted. Olajuwon spun counterclockwise and faked a jump shot. Robinson, who was voted the 1995 NBA MVP, fell for the fake and jumped to block the shot. With Robinson in the air, Olajuwon performed an up-and-under move and made an easy layup.|$|E
5|$|The British {{had been}} alerted to Arnold's {{approach}} and had destroyed {{all of the}} boats on the river's southern banks. Although two warships, the frigate Lizard (26 guns) and the sloop-of-war Hunter (16 guns), <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> a constant patrol to prevent a river crossing, Arnold was able to procure sufficient watercraft for his men, and crossed to the Quebec City side on November 11. He then realized his force was {{not strong enough to}} capture the city, so he retreated several miles and waited for Montgomery.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel <b>kept</b> <b>up</b> {{resistance}} against the Spanish {{for a number}} of years, but on 9 May 1530, exhausted by the warfare that had seen the deaths of their best warriors and the enforced abandonment of their crops, the two kings of the most important clans returned from the wilds. A day later they were joined by many nobles and their families and many more people; they then surrendered at the new Spanish capital at Ciudad Vieja. The former inhabitants of Iximche were dispersed; some were moved to Tecpán, the rest to Sololá and other towns around Lake Atitlán.|$|E
