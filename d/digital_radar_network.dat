The first radar {{was set up}} on Bruny Island, Tas-mania {{at the end of}} 1999 and development of the second radar to be placed near Invercargill, NZ, has begun. TIGER is part of the Super Dual Auroral <b>Radar</b> <b>Network</b> (SuperDARN) which cur-rently consists of 15 radars deployed in the northern and south-ern hemispheres. TIGER is located more equatorward than other SuperDARN radars enabling it to observe new phenomena, such as Auroral Westward Flow Channels (AWFCs).

40|$|<b>Radar</b> <b>networks</b> {{are proven}} to have {{numerous}} advantages over traditional monostatic and bistatic radar. With recent developments, <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> {{have become an}} attractive platform due to their low probability of intercept (LPI) performance for target tracking. In this paper, a joint sensor selection and power allocation algorithm for multiple-target tracking in a <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> based on LPI is proposed. It is found that this algorithm can minimize the total transmitted power of a <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> {{on the basis of}} a predetermined mutual information (MI) threshold between the target impulse response and the reflected signal. The MI is required by the <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> system to estimate target parameters, and it can be calculated predictively with the estimation of target state. The optimization problem of sensor selection and power allocation, which contains two variables, is non-convex and it can be solved by separating power allocation problem from sensor selection problem. To be specific, the optimization problem of power allocation can be solved by using the bisection method for each sensor selection scheme. Also, the optimization problem of sensor selection can be solved by a lower complexity algorithm based on the allocated powers. According to the simulation results, it can be found that the proposed algorithm can effectively reduce the total transmitted power of a <b>radar</b> <b>network,</b> which can be conducive to improving LPI performance...|$|R

The present study investigates issues concerning the joint optimization of receiver placement and illuminator selection for a passive <b>radar</b> <b>network.</b> Firstly, the required radar cross section (RCS) for target detection is chosen as the performance metric, and the joint optimization model boils down to the partition p-center problem (PPCP). The PPCP is then solved by a proposed bisection algorithm.

30|$|From pure {{communication}} networks, we {{know they}} only work reliably for a limited density of nodes. In <b>radar</b> <b>networks,</b> both communication and radar can fail. In this paper, we aim to provide a new tool for analyzing the performance of OFDM <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> {{with respect to the}} signal parametrization and the network geometry. When the interference level rises, the ability to detect specific objects decreases. We therefore chose to introduce <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> outage as the relevant metric, which describes the situation when a <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> is no longer able to detect a specific object due to interference by others. Choosing successful detection as the main performance metric makes sense for several reasons: It is the first and most basic step in any radar system, and all subsequent operations (range estimation, etc.) depend on it. Also, unlike the detection, the range and Doppler accuracy do not change significantly when operating in a network (cf. [3, 5] for resources on OFDM radar accuracy).|$|R
40|$|Widely {{distributed}} <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> architectures {{can provide}} significant performance improvement for target detection and localization. For a fixed <b>radar</b> <b>network,</b> the achievable target detection performance may go beyond a predetermined threshold with full transmitted power allocation, which is extremely vulnerable in modern electronic warfare. In this paper, we study {{the problem of}} low probability of intercept (LPI) design for <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> and propose two novel LPI optimization schemes based on information-theoretic criteria. For a predefined threshold of target detection, Schleher intercept factor is minimized by optimizing transmission power allocation among netted <b>radars</b> in the <b>network.</b> Due {{to the lack of}} analytical closed-form expression for receiver operation characteristics (ROC), we employ two information-theoretic criteria, namely, Bhattacharyya distance and J-divergence as the metrics for target detection performance. The resulting nonconvex and nonlinear LPI optimization problems associated with different information-theoretic criteria are cast under a unified framework, and the nonlinear programming based genetic algorithm (NPGA) is used to tackle the optimization problems in the framework. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our proposed LPI strategies are effective in enhancing the LPI performance for <b>radar</b> <b>network...</b>|$|R
40|$|Distributed <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> {{systems have}} been shown to have many unique features. Due to their {{advantage}} of signal and spatial diversities, <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> are attractive for target detection. In practice, the netted <b>radars</b> in <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> are supposed to maximize their transmit power to achieve better detection performance, which may be in contradiction with low probability of intercept (LPI). Therefore, this paper investigates the problem of adaptive power allocation for <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> in a cooperative game-theoretic framework such that the LPI performance can be improved. Taking into consideration both the transmit power constraints and the minimum signal to interference plus noise ratio (SINR) requirement of each radar, a cooperative Nash bargaining power allocation game (NBPAG) based on LPI is formulated, whose objective is to minimize the total transmit power by optimizing the power allocation in <b>radar</b> <b>networks.</b> First, a novel SINR-based network utility function is defined and utilized as a metric to evaluate power allocation. Then, with the well-designed network utility function, the existence and uniqueness of the Nash bargaining solution (NBS) are proved analytically. Finally, an iterative Nash bargaining algorithm is developed that converges quickly to a Pareto optimal equilibrium for the cooperative game.

The active <b>radar</b> <b>networks</b> {{are composed of}} multiple radar transmitters and multichannel receivers placed on moving platforms. First, the log-likelihood function of the received signal for a Rician target is derived, where the received signal scattered off the target comprises of dominant scatterer (DS) component and weak isotropic scatterers (WIS) components. Then, the analytically closed-form expressions of the Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) on the Cartesian coordinates of target position and velocity are calculated, which can be adopted as a performance metric to access the target parameter estimation accuracy for LFM-based <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> systems in a Rice fading environment. It is found that the cumulative Fisher information matrix (FIM) is a linear combination of both DS component and WIS components, and it also demonstrates that the joint CRLB {{is a function of}} signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), target’s radar cross section (RCS) and transmitted waveform parameters, as well as the relative geometry between the target and the <b>radar</b> <b>network</b> architectures.
