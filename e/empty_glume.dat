40|$|Rice empty glumes, {{also named}} sterile lemmas or {{rudimentary}} lemmas according to different interpretations, are distinct from lemmas in morphology and cellular pattern. Consistently, the molecular mechanism {{to control the}} development of lemmas {{is different from that}} of empty glumes. Rice LEAFY HULL STERILE 1 (OsLHS 1) and DROOPING LEAF(DL) regulate the cellular pattern and the number of vascular bundles of lemmas respectively, while LONG STERILE LEMMA 1 (G 1) /ELONGATED <b>EMPTY</b> <b>GLUME</b> (ELE) and PANICLE PHYTOMER 2 (PAP 2) /OsMADS 34 determine identities of empty glumes. Though some progress has been made, identities of empty glumes remain unclear, and genetic interactions between lemma genes and glume genes have been rarely elucidated. In this research, a new G 1 /ELE mutant g 1 - 6 was identified and the phenotype was analyzed. Similar to previously reported mutant lines of G 1 /ELE, empty glumes of g 1 - 6 plants transform into lemma-like organs. Furthermore, Phenotypes of single and double mutant plants suggest that, in addition to their previously described gene-specific functions, G 1 /ELE and OsLHS 1 play redundant roles in controlling vascular bundle number, cell volume, and cell layer number of empty glumes and lemmas. Meanwhile, expression patterns of G 1 /ELE in osmads 1 -z flowers and OsLHS 1 in g 1 - 6 flowers indicate they do not regulate each other at the level of transcription. Finally, down-regulation of the <b>empty</b> <b>glume</b> gene OsMADS 34 /PAP 2 and ectopic expression of the lemma gene DL, in the g 1 - 6 plants provide further evidence that empty glumes are sterile lemmas. Generally, our findings provided valuable information for better understanding functions of G 1 and OsLHS 1 in flower development and identities of empty glumes...|$|E
40|$|Online on Aug. 26, 2017 Grasses display {{highly diversified}} {{inflorescence}} architectures that {{differ in the}} arrangement of spikelets and flowers and determine cereal yields. However, the molecular basis underlying grass inflorescence morphogenesis remains largely unknown. Here we investigate {{the role of a}} functionally diversified SEPALLATA MADS-box transcription factor, OsMADS 34, in regulating rice (Oryza sativa L.) inflorescence and spikelet development. Microarray analysis showed that, at the very early stages of inflorescence formation, dysfunction of OsMADS 34 caused altered expression of 379 genes that are associated with protein modification and degradation, transcriptional regulation, signaling and metabolism activity. Genetic analysis revealed that OsMADS 34 controls different aspects of inflorescence structure, branching and meristem activity synergistically with LAX PANICLE 1 (LAX 1) and FLORAL ORGAN NUMBER 4 (FON 4), as evidenced by the enhanced phenotypes of osmads 34 lax 1 and osmads 34 fon 4 compared with the single mutants. Additionally, double mutant between osmads 34 and the sterile lemma defective mutant elongated <b>empty</b> <b>glume</b> (ele) displayed an enhanced phenotype, that is, longer and wider sterile lemmas that were converted into lemma/palea-like organs, suggesting that ELE and OsMADS 34 synergistically control the sterile lemma development. OsMADS 34 may act together with OsMADS 15 in controlling sterile lemma development. Collectively, these findings provide insights into the regulatory function of OsMADS 34 in rice inflorescence and spikelet development.

OnlineOpen: This article is {{available}} free online at www. blackwell-synergy. com Summary Recent {{studies have shown}} that molecular control of inner floral organ identity appears to be largely conserved between monocots and dicots, but little is known regarding the molecular mechanism underlying development of the monocot outer floral organ, a unique floral structure in grasses. In this study, we report the cloning of the rice EXTRA GLUME 1 (EG 1) gene, a putative lipase gene that specifies empty-glume fate and floral meristem determinacy. In addition to affecting the identity and number of <b>empty</b> <b>glumes,</b> mutations in EG 1 caused ectopic floral organs to be formed at each organ whorl or in extra ectopic whorls. Iterative glume-like structures or new floral organ primordia were formed in the presumptive region of the carpel, resulting in an indeterminate floral meristem. EG 1 is expressed strongly in inflorescence primordia and weakly in developing floral primordia. We also found that the floral meristem and organ identity gene OsLHS 1 showed altered expression with respect to both pattern and levels in the eg 1 mutant, and is probably responsible for the pleiotropic floral defects in eg 1.

40|$|A typical barley (Hordeum vulgare) floret {{consists}} of reproductive organs three stamens and a pistil, and non-reproductive organs-lodicules and two floral bracts, abaxial called 'lemma' and adaxial 'palea'. The floret is subtended by two additional bracts called outer or <b>empty</b> <b>glumes.</b> Together these organs form the basic structural {{unit of the}} grass inflorescence, a spikelet. There are commonly three spikelets at each rachis (floral stem of the barley spike) node, one central and two lateral spikelets. Rare naturally occurring or induced phenotypic variants that contain a third bract subtending the central spikelets have been described in barley. The gene responsible for this phenotype was called the THIRD OUTER GLUME 1 (Trd 1). The Trd 1 mutants fail to suppress bract growth {{and as a result}} produce leaf-like structures that subtend each rachis node in the basal portion of the spike. Also, floral development at the collar is not always suppressed. In rice and maize, recessive mutations in NECK LEAF 1 (Nl 1) and TASSEL SHEATH 1 (Tsh 1) genes, respectively, {{have been shown to be}} responsible for orthologous phenotypes. Fine mapping of the trd 1 phenotype in an F- 3 recombinant population enabled us to position on the long arm of chromosome 1 H to a 10 cM region. We anchored this to a conserved syntenic region on rice chromosome Os 05 and selected a set of candidate genes for validation by resequencing PCR amplicons from a series of independent mutant alleles. This analysis revealed that a GATA transcription factor, recently proposed to be Trd 1, contained mutations in 10 out of 14 independent trd 1 mutant alleles that would generate non-functional TRD 1 proteins. Together with genetic linkage data, we confirm the identity of Trd 1 as the GATA transcription factor ortholog of rice Nl 1 and maize Tsh 1 genes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{genetics}} of spikelet formation, {{a feature}} unique to grasses such as rice and maize, {{is yet to}} be fully understood, although a number of meristem and organ identity mutants have been isolated and investigated in Arabidopsis and maize. Using a two-element Ac/Ds transposon tagging system we have isolated a rice mutant, designated branched floretless 1 (bfl 1) which is defective in the transition from spikelet meristem to floret meristem. Results The bfl 1 mutant shows normal differentiation of the primary rachis-branches leading to initial spikelet meristem (bract-like structure equivalent to rudimentary glumes) formation but fails to develop <b>empty</b> <b>glumes</b> and florets. Instead, axillary meristems in the bract-like structure produce sequential alternate branching, thus resulting in a coral shaped morphology of the branches in the developing panicle. The bfl 1 mutant harbours a single Ds insertion in the upstream region of the BFL 1 gene on chromosome 7 corresponding to PAC clone P 0625 E 02 (GenBank Acc No. message URL [URL] RT-PCR analyses revealed a drastic reduction of BFL 1 transcript levels in the bfl 1 mutant compared to that in the wild-type. In each of the normal panicle-bearing progeny plants, from occasional revertant seeds of the vegetatively-propagated mutant plant, Ds was shown to be excised from the bfl 1 locus. BFL 1 contains an EREBP/AP 2 domain and is most likely an ortholog of the maize transcription factor gene BRANCHED SILKLESS 1 (BD 1). Conclusions bfl 1 is a Ds -tagged rice mutant defective in the transition from spikelet meristem (SM) to floret meristem (FM). BFL 1 is most probably a rice ortholog of the maize ERF (EREBP/AP 2) transcription factor gene BD 1. Based on the similarities in mutant phenotypes bfl 1 is likely to be an allele of the previously reported frizzy panicle locus. </p...|$|R

40|$|Rice have highly derived florets borne {{on a short}} branch called ‘spikelet’ {{comprised}} {{of a pair of}} rudimentary glumes and sterile lemma (<b>empty</b> <b>glumes)</b> that subtends a single fertile floret. The floral organs consist of a pair of lodicules, six stamens and a central carpel that are enclosed by a pair of bract-like organs, called lemma and palea. A progressive reprogramming of meristem identity during the floral development of flowers, on branches on the inflorescence, is correlated with changes in transcriptional status of regulatory genes that execute cascades of distinct developmental events. On the other hand phytohormones such as auxin and cytokinin that are critical in predetermining the sites of new organ primordia emergence and in maintaining the size or populations of meristems. Molecular genetic analyses of mutants have expanded the repository of genes regulating floral organ specification and identity, yet the finer mechanistic details on process downstream to these regulatory genes and co-ordination with phytohormone signalling pathways needs further investigation. One aim of the study presented in this thesis is to develop a tool that would display of spatial description of dynamic auxin or cytokinin accumulation in developing rice inflorescence and floral meristems and to evaluate auxin distribution defects of OsMADS 1 -RNAi florets using this tool. Additionally, we aim to understand the regulatory effects on OsMADS 1 on candidate floral organ and meristem fate determining genes during two temporal phases of flower development to decipher other regulatory cascades controlled by OsMADS 1. Spatial distribution profile of phytohormones in young and developing meristems of rice Cytokinin promotes meristem activity (Su et al., 2011) while auxin accumulation, directed by auxin efflux transport PIN proteins predicts sites of new organ initiation (Reinhardt et al., 2003; van Mourik et al., 2012). Previous studies in the lab deciphered that OsMADS 1 exerts positive regulatory effects on genes in auxin pathways and repressive effects on cytokinin signaling and biosynthetic genes (Khanday et al., 2013). Thus, the need for a reliable system to understand auxin and cytokinin activity in live inflorescence and floral meristems of rice motivated us to raise promoter: reporter tools to map the spatial and temporal phytohormone distribution. Confocal live imaging conditions in primary roots of IR 4 DR-GFP and DR 5 -CyPet lines was performed and responsiveness of the DR 5 elements to auxin was authenticated. Auxin maxima were distinctly seen in the epidermal and sub-epidermal cells of inflorescence branch primordia anlagen and apices of newly emerged branch primordia. As floral organs were being initiated, on the floret meristem, we discerned the sequential appearance of auxin accumulation at sites of organ primordia while apices of early floral meristems (FM) showed low auxin content. We clearly detect canalization of auxin streams marking regions of vascular inception. Using this live imaging system we probed auxin patterns and levels in malformed and indeterminate OsMADS 1 -RNAi florets and we observed a significant reduction in the levels of auxin. Two oppositely positioned peaks of auxin were noted in the persistent FM of OsMADS 1 -RNAi florets, a pattern similar to auxin dynamics at sites of rudimentary glume primordia on the wild-type (WT) spikelet meristem. These studies were followed up with immunohistochemistry (IHC) on fixed tissues for “PIN” transport proteins that suggest PIN convergence towards organ initiation sites, regions where auxin accumulation was clearly visualized by the IR 4 DR 5 -GFP and DR 5 -CyPet reporters. IHC experiments that detected GFP, in fixed tissues of TCSn-mGFP ER (WT) and TCSn-mGFP ER;OsMADS 1 -RNAi (OsMADS 1 -RNAi) inflorescence and florets showed an ectopic increase in the domain of cells with cytokinin response in OsMADS 1 -RNAi florets, compared to that of WT. Intriguingly, cytokinin responsive cells persisted in the central FM of OsMADS 1 -RNAi florets that might partially account for some of the FM indeterminacy defects seen in these florets. A correlative observation of these different imaging data hint at some exclusive patterns of the IR 4 DR 5 /DR 5 and TCSn reporters that in turn lead us to speculate that a cross talk between auxin and cytokinin distribution may contribute to the precise phyllotaxy of lateral organs in rice inflorescence. Studies on novel targets of OsMADS 1 in floral organ identity and meristem determinacy Loss of OsMADS 1 function results in rice florets with miss specified floral organs and an indeterminate carpel produces new abnormal florets. Despite having several mutants in OsMADS 1, mechanisms of how OsMADS 1 regulates meristem maintenance and termination is not well understood. Global expression profile in OsMADS 1 -RNAi vs. WT tissues encompassing a wide range of developing florets (0. 2 to 2 cm panicles), gave an overview of OsMADS 1 functions in many aspects of floret development. Here, a gene-targeted knockout of OsMADS 1 named - osmads 1 ko (generated in a collaborative study) was characterized and found to display extreme defects in floral organs and an indeterminate FM. Strikingly, in addition to loss of determinacy, FM reverts to a prior developmental fate of inflorescence on whose new rachis are leaf-like malformed florets. We suggest these phenotypes reflect the null phenotype of OsMADS 1 and its role in meristem fate maintenance. We tested gene expression levels for some proven targets of OsMADS 1 (Khanday et al., 2013) and utilized panicles in two developmental phases- young early FMs (panicles of 0. 2 to 0. 5 cm) and older florets with organ differentiation (panicles of 0. 5 to 1 cm). We observed temporally different effects on the regulation of OsMADS 34 that together with histology of young osmads 1 ko inflorescences suggest that the mutant is impeded for spikelet to floral meristem transition. In addition, OsMADS 1 had a positive regulatory effect on genes implicated for lemma and palea organ identity such as OsIDS 1, OsDH 1, OsYABBY 1, OsMADS 15, OsMADS 32, OsDP 1 and OsSPL 16 in both young and old panicles while OsIG 1 was negatively regulated in both phases of development. MADS-box genes important for carpel and ovule development - OsMADS 13 and OsMADS 58 were had significantly reduced expression in florets undergoing organ differentiation. OsMADS 1 positively regulated several other non MADS-box developmental genes - OsSPT, OsHEC 2 and OsULT 1, whose Arabidopsis homologs control carpel development and FM determinacy. These genes are de-regulated in later stages of osmads 1 ko floret development and are unaffected in younger panicles. Finally, OsMADS 1 continually activated meristem maintenance genes - OsBAM 2 -like and OsMADS 6 while the activation of OSH 1 in early floral meristems was later altered to a repressive effect in developing florets. Perhaps such dynamic temporal effects on meristem genes are instrumental in the timely termination of the floral meristem after floral organ differentiation. More importantly, we show that regulation of many of these genes is directly affected by OsMADS 1, through our studies on expression levels before and after chemical induction of OsMADS 1 -GR protein in amiRNAOsMADS 1 florets. Further, some key downstream targets were re-affirmed by studying expression status in transgenic lines, with the OsMADS 1 -EAR repressive protein variant. These results provide new insights into the developmentally phased roles of OsMADS 1 on floral meristem regulators and determinants of organ identity to form a determinate rice floret. Gene networks regulated by OsMADS 1 during early flower development To identify global targets in early floret meristems, we determined the differential RNA transcriptome in osmads 1 ko tissues as compared to wild-type tissues. These data revealed regulators of inflorescence architecture, floral organ identity including MADS-box floral homeotic factors, factors for meristem maintenance, auxin response, transport and biosynthesis as some of the important functional classes amongst the 2725 differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Integrating DEGs with OsMADS 1 ChIP-seq data (prior studies from our lab) we deciphered direct vs. indirect and positive vs. negatively regulated targets of OsMADS 1. These datasets reveal an enrichment for functional categories such as metabolic processes, signaling, RNA transcription and processing, hormone metabolism and protein modification. Using Bio-Tapestry plot as a tool we present a visualization of a floral stage-specific regulatory network for genes with likely functional roles in meristem specification and in organ development. Further, to examine if indirect targets regulated by OsMADS 1 could be mediated through transcription factors (that are themselves direct targets), we constructed a small network with the transcription factors OSH 1, OSH 15 and OsYABBY 1 as key nodal genes and we predicted their downstream effects. Taken together, these analyses provide examples of the complex networks that OsMADS 1 controls during the process of rice floret development. In summary, we surmise that defect in phytohormone distribution in OsMADS 1 knockdown florets results in irregular patterns of lateral organ primordia emergence. In addition, the derangements in the developmentally stage specific expression of floral meristems identity and organ identity genes culminates in miss-specified and irregularly patterned abnormal organs in Osmads 1 florets. Thus, our study highlights the versatility of OsMADS 1 in regulating components of hormone signaling and response, and its effects on various floral development regulators results in the formation of a single determinate floret on the spikelet.
