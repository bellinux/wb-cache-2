An oral hearing was held and the board requested the developers to make certain changes {{which resulted in the}} plans being scaled down by approximately 10%. Some 3,700 objections were made on these updated plans. On 9 August 2007, the board approved the final plans, while imposing 13 conditions on construction works, including the retention of public access to the Cliff Walk during the development period, strict guidelines in relation to dust suppression, the re-use of <b>demolition</b> <b>materials,</b> and limitations on the hours of operation and noise levels. The board also over-ruled an earlier inspector's report, instead permitting an old unlicensed landfill to remain beside the new apartments.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} was undertaken {{to investigate the}} suitability of recycled construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>materials</b> as alternative pipe backfilling materials for stormwater and sewer pipes. Three commonly found recycled construction and demolition waste materials, (crushed brick, recycled concrete aggregate and reclaimed asphalt pavement) were investigated to assess their suitability as a pipe backfilling material. The physical, geotechnical and chemical properties of these construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>materials</b> were compared with local engineering and water authorities specifications for typical quarried materials so as to assess their performance as a viable substitute for virgin quarried aggregates in pipe backfilling applications. Physical and geotechnical characterisation tests such as particle size distribution, specific gravity, water absorption, Los Angeles abrasion, California Bearing Ratio and modified Proctor compaction tests were undertaken. Chemical properties were also determined, including organic content, pH, trace element or total concentration and leachate testing of the construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>materials</b> {{for a range of}} contaminant constituents. In terms of physical, geotechnical and chemical assessment for pipe backfilling applications, recycled concrete aggregate and crushed brick were found to have the properties recommended by environmental protection authorities while reclaimed asphalt pavement material did not meet some of the specified requirements. Also shear strength properties were found to be equivalent or superior to those of typical quarry backfilling materials.

40|$|Building-related {{construction}} {{debris and}} demolition (C&D) materials are commonly grouped {{as a single}} type of material, {{despite the fact that}} these two material streams come from different processes. 1 Construction materials originate from construction, repair or remodeling activities. This materials stream typically consists of a variety of building products (such as concrete, roofing, gypsum wallboard, wood products, plastics, insulation, tile, and metal) as well as the packaging materials that building materials arrive in (such as cardboard and plastics). Construction materials are usually generated as a result of cutting a material down to size for installation or purchasing materials in excess of what is needed. Wood materials consists of wood scraps from dimensional lumber, siding, laminates, flooring (potentially stained), laminated beams, and moldings (potentially painted). <b>Demolition</b> <b>materials</b> are generated from the dismantling of buildings or the removal phase of remodeling. Typical constituents include concrete, wood, metal, insulation, glass, carpet, and other building materials. Debris from this process is often painted or chemically treated or is fastened to other materials, making separation difficult (NESCAUM 2006).

40|$|The State of New South Wales Government in Australia {{actively}} pursues {{a policy}} of waste minimization {{as part of an}} effort to promote ecologically sustainable development within the state. The waste minimization strategy is developed within a framework in which resource recovery including re-use, reprocessing, recycling and energy recovery are being encouraged. Construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>materials,</b> which is conservatively estimated to constitute about 16 % of total waste produced in the Sydney basin is an important target group of waste materials for which recycling is a priority. Most of the construction and demolition waste not recycled ended up in the landfills occupying valuable land not to mention the cost incurred in landfilling. This paper describes an overview of the waste minimization approach taken within NSW, the policies and programs that are put in place to bring about successful outcomes. As a result of a nurturing hand from the government, a recycling industry for construction and <b>demolition</b> <b>materials</b> has developed within the state. This paper also presents an industry perspective of construction and demolition waste recycling based on the results of a survey of the recycling firms in the Sydney area to gauge perception of the current state as well as the future of the industry.

Hydrogeological attributes such as permeability expectedly drive biodiversity patterns in groundwater because they not only exert a direct influence on organisms but also control fluxes of nutrients and organic matter. We used the OMI analysis (outlying mean index) to examine the responses of multiple species to hydrogeological and physico-chemical variables in a shallow water-table aquifer along the Loire River, France, the water chemistry of which has been severely affected by gravel extraction and refilling with <b>demolition</b> <b>materials.</b> Hydrogeological attributes were obtained from a finite-difference groundwater flow model whereas physical variables and biological data (i. e. presence – absence of species) were collected during a single survey of 29 wells.

Spatial variation in physico-chemistry of groundwater induced by the dissolution of buried <b>demolition</b> <b>materials</b> had no detectable influence on the distribution pattern of fauna. Rather, species were significantly distributed along an environmental gradient defined primarily by permeability and vadose zone thickness.
