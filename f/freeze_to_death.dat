5|$|The song {{features}} the lead pair singing amidst a flower farm as mridangam and flute players accompany {{them in the}} background. It was choreographed by Raju Sundaram who also appears in a cameo, playing a harmonium. As part of their roles, the male supporting actors who appear in the song were required to wear a panjakkacham and angavastram, leaving most of their body exposed to the freezing cold. The shoot began as early as 5:30 AM and the locals, who thought they should be out of their mind to be dressed so, came {{up to them and}} warned that they might <b>freeze</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b>|$|E
500|$|Some years pass. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police {{establish}} a post at Tjaranak, bringing law {{to the area}} for the first time. Several white men accuse the Eskimos of being savage and without morals, and charge Mala {{with the murder of}} the ship captain. Sergeant Hunt and Constable Balk try to find Mala and arrest him, but get lost in a blizzard and nearly <b>freeze</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Kripik finds them, and saves their lives. Kripik is angry with the men until Hunt explains that they do not want Kripik's wives. When Hunt asks if Kripik knows Mala, Kripik says [...] "Mala is no more". The Mounties believe Mala is dead, but their misunderstanding is corrected by Akat, who arrives in the village and innocently exposes Kripik.|$|E
500|$|PVA {{casualties}} {{during the}} first 12 months of the Korean War, from October 1950 to October 1951, were heavy. Soviet material support was slight; and, because the only available means to transport supplies into Korea {{for the first year}} of the war was a force of 700,000 labourers, all available supplies were light and limited. The UN forces also had complete air superiority. These logistic constraints later caused 45,000 Chinese soldiers to <b>freeze</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> between November 27 and December 12, 1950, due to inadequate winter clothing. China's insufficient artillery, armor, and air support meant that Peng was forced to rely heavily on human wave tactics until the summer of 1951: stealthy fireteams attacked in column against weak points in enemy defenses, hoping that surprise, attrition and perseverance would break the enemy lines. Participants even drank large quantities of Kaoliang wine in order to improve their courage. Some of the worst Chinese battle losses occurred during the Second and the Fifth Phase Campaign: up to 40 percent of all Chinese forces in Korea were rendered combat ineffective between November 25 and December 24, 1950, and about 12 Chinese divisions were lost in during April 22 – June 10, 1951. All in all, over a million Chinese soldiers became casualties during the course of the war. Peng justified the PVA's high casualty rate by his almost religious belief in the cause of Communism and the Communist Party, and his belief that the ends of the conflict justified the means. Some accounts even claimed that Peng invented the human wave tactic under the name [...] "short attack" [...] in order to exploit his manpower advantage.|$|E

2500|$|The {{camp was}} hastily built at an {{elevation}} of , {{so it was not}} well suited for the harsh winters typical of Oregon's high desert country.

2500|$|Recently, breeders {{have begun}} {{importing}} expensive foreign racehorse breeds like Arabians and Thoroughbreds {{with the goal}} of breeding them to native stock to produce faster horses, but these relatively fragile breeds are unable to survive on the steppe like Mongolian horses can; if left unsheltered, such horses inevitably <b>freeze</b> <b>to</b> <b>death</b> or starve. [...] So, breeders have focused on created crossbreeds between foreign horses and native Mongolian stock. [...] The ultimate goal is to produce a race horse that has one-quarter foreign blood and three-quarters Mongolian blood; this proportion is believed to create a horse hardy enough to survive in Mongolia and combine the Mongolian horse's stamina and endurance with foreign speed to produce a new breed with the best qualities of both.|$|E

[...] Huang thus counterattacked and retook the city, dealing Tang forces heavy losses. [...] Subsequently, Tang and Qi forces repeatedly engaged in battles outside the city with indecisive results.

2500|$|Silver Surfer {{appears in}} The Super Hero Squad Show, voiced by Mikey Kelley. This version of him has a literal [...] "surfer dude" [...] accent, and is {{initially}} much more kid friendly, although later episodes place {{him under the}} influence of the Infinity Gems and Sword and he develops a Dark Surfer persona. This persona takes control of the Surfer in the second half of Season 2. As the Dark Surfer, he steals the Infinity Gauntlet from the first half's main villain, Thanos, seals him up in the Soul Gem, and combines its power with that of the first season's powerful item of focus, the Infinity Sword. Then he uses the power of both items to destroy two-thirds of the universe, separate the members of the squad across the multiverse, and send Earth farther away from the Sun, so the planet could <b>freeze</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Once the squad reunites, they make it their goal to stop the Dark Surfer. In the final episode, his Dark Surfer persona is destroyed and he is purified when his powerful items are shattered into numerous Infinity Fractals and spread across the universe, all while repairing the damage the Dark Surfer caused. Back to normal, the Silver Surfer apologizes for his behavior as the Dark Surfer and he promises to rejoin the squad, after he pays his debt.|$|E
2500|$|... "Gentlemen," [...] he {{was saying}} as I approached, [...] "what do we mean when we say that a man is 'some pumpkins'? We mean that he is full of ideas just as a pumpkin is full of seeds.

A traveler is lost on a Western prairie. He has wandered all day, far from home and with nothing to eat. Night comes on. The wolves begin to howl in the darkness. At last he reaches a log cabin, almost in ruins. No matter, it will afford him shelter for the night. Scarcely has he entered and composed himself to rest when a violent storm arises. Thunders roar. Lightnings flash. The snow heaps against the door. It grows bitterly cold. What shall he do? He can't stay there and <b>freeze</b> <b>to</b> <b>death.</b> Let me illustrate. Two darkies, walking down Broadway, saw a quarter of a dollar on the sidewalk. One of the colored gentlemen said to his companion, 'Sambo, don't you freeze to dat quarter. I seed it first.' That is just the idea. He can't stay there and freeze. His soul—but {{what do we know about}} the soul? Is it homogeneous or heterogeneous? Who can tell? Who except me, Daniel Pratt, the Great American Traveler, and soon to be President of the United States? Why not? Was not imperial Rome once saved by the cackling of a goose?" ...|$|E
