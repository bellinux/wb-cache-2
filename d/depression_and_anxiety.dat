5|$|Benzodiazepines possess sedative, hypnotic, anxiolytic, anticonvulsant, muscle relaxant, and amnesic actions, {{which are}} useful {{in a variety of}} {{indications}} such as alcohol dependence, seizures, anxiety disorders, panic, agitation, and insomnia. Most are administered orally; however, they can also be given intravenously, intramuscularly, or rectally. In general, benzodiazepines are well-tolerated and are safe and effective drugs in the short term {{for a wide range of}} conditions. Tolerance can develop to their effects and there is also a risk of dependence, and upon discontinuation a withdrawal syndrome may occur. These factors, combined with other possible secondary effects after prolonged use such as psychomotor, cognitive, or memory impairments, limit their long-term applicability. The effects of long-term use or misuse include the tendency to cause or worsen cognitive deficits, <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> <b>anxiety.</b> The College of Physicians and Surgeons of British Columbia recommends discontinuing the usage of benzodiazepines in those on opioids and those who have used them long term.|$|E
5|$|Cognitive and emotional: neuropsychiatric {{symptomatology}} {{is common}} {{in the course of}} the disease. <b>Depression</b> <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> appear in up to 80% of patients,. Emotional lability leading to uncontrollable crying is also common. These symptoms can be treated with antidepressants and cognitive behavioral therapy; however, high quality studies on efficacy are lacking. For example, in the specific case of antidepressants and depression, only two studies were considered worth considering as of 2011 by the Cochrane collaboration and they only showed a trend towards efficacy. Other neuropsychiatric symptoms are euphoria and disinhibition. Cognitive impairment is a frequent complication of MS even after the introduction of disease-modifying treatments in the last 20 years. Although the disease is usually the primary cause of cognitive problems, other factors such as medications, relapses or depression may be enhancing them so a correct evaluation of the deficits and factors exacerbating them is important. Regarding primary deficits, data point towards administration of L-amphetamine and methylphenidate being useful, whereas memantine and anticholinesterase drugs such as donepezil—commonly used in Alzheimer disease— are not considered effective in improving cognitive functions. Effectiveness of cognitive rehabilitation therapy is more controverted. For those patients with MS who have pseudobulbar affect (PBA), characterized by uncontrollable episodes of crying and/or laughing, or other emotional displays, Dextromethorphan/quinidine can be considered as treatment as it is the only FDA approved drug for treatment for PBA, though other medications such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants have been used in clinical practice.|$|E

The study was also designed to compare the prevalence of <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> general <b>anxiety</b> amongst the POW’s children and normal adults, 20 years after the Iraq-Iran war.  Method: An analytic cross-sectional study carried out in June 2009 in Yazd (the centre of Yazd province in Iran). The target and sampled population were the children of the Iranian POW who lived in Yazd. One hundred and twenty six POW’s children, who were born before 1990 (date of father's freedom) were assessed. The duration of father’s captivation was between 29 - 119 months. Ninety-five subjects accepted to participate. General <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> major <b>depression</b> were assessed by Persian version of Hamilton Scale for <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> Beck <b>depression</b> Inventory. This study was a combination of the psychological interview and questionnaire. Ninety five of normal adult group were also paired matched and assessed.  Result: Among 126 POW’s children who fulfilled the inclusion criteria, the responsive rate was 75. 3 % (95 participants). The mean age of participants was 28. 3 (SD: 5. 34). The father’s captivation duration were 29 - 119 months (mean: 79. 2, SD: 21. 6). The prevalence of <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> general <b>anxiety</b> amongst the POW’s children were 48. 4 % and 79 %. The prevalence of <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> general <b>anxiety</b> among the paired group were 21. 1 % and 63. 2 %. The differences between two groups were significant (p = 0. 000).  Conclusion: In this study we have demonstrated the prevalence of major <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> general <b>anxiety</b> in POW’s children and a normal adult sample.

40|$|Compared to {{the general}} population, {{university}} students experience higher rates of poor sleep quality <b>and</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress. These issues impact upon students’ psychological wellbeing, academic studies, and everyday functioning. Mindfulness {{has been shown to}} influence <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress, as well as sleep quality. The aim of the current study was to examine whether mindfulness and sleep quality predicted <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress in a sample of 173 Australian university students. Participants were recruited through an online research participation pool and were aged between 18 to 57 years, including 132 females and 34 males. Participants completed an online survey comprising a series of questionnaires that measured self-reported depression, anxiety, stress, sleep quality, and mindfulness. Results showed that sleep quality and mindfulness significantly predicted <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress. However mindfulness alone did not predict sleep quality. The findings indicated that students with poorer sleep quality reported higher levels of <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress, and students with higher levels of mindfulness reported lower levels of <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress. The present study provides preliminary support for universities to develop and implement programs to cultivate mindfulness in university students, and health promotion and educational programs that emphasise the importance of both sleep quality and psychological wellbeing in university students...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{explore the}} {{relationships}} between smoking dependence behavior, <b>depression,</b> anger, <b>and,</b> <b>anxiety</b> in pregnant adolescents. Research hypotheses were: 1. <b>Depression,</b> anger, <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> are mood states that are present in pregnant adolescents who smoke. 2. <b>Depression,</b> anger, <b>and,</b> <b>anxiety</b> are inter-related. 3. <b>Depression,</b> anger, <b>and</b> <b>anxiety</b> affect smoking dependent behavior of pregnant teens who began smoking prior to pregnancy. 4. <b>Depression,</b> anger, <b>and,</b> <b>anxiety</b> affect smoking consumption of pregnant teens who smoke. Methods: Secondary data analysis of baseline data from a longitudinal study, "Nursing Intervention for Young Pregnant Smokers" (PI: S. Albrecht, RO 1 NR 03233) was performed. Of 224 eligible adolescents, 142 pregnant, smoker, adolescents signed an informed consent. One-hundred, eight complete and valid cases were analyzed for their responses to the following instruments: Modified State/Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Modified Center for Studies of <b>Depression</b> (CES-D), Confidence <b>and</b> Temptation Scale, Fagerstrom Tolerance Nicotine Dependence Test (FTND). Results: Descriptive and exploratory data analyses were used to identify outliers, assess missing data, and verify assumptions. In the correlational analysis, anger, <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> <b>depression</b> are correlated (p =. 000). In additional analysis, self-efficacy was correlated with anger (p =. 007), anxiety (p =. 001), and FTND score (p=. 002). Hierarchial Multiple Regression, controlling for covariates, revealed that self-efficacy significantly predicted smoking dependence behavior (p =. 006). <b>Depression,</b> anger, <b>and,</b> <b>anxiety</b> were not realized as predictors in this sample. However, an exploratory analysis of self-efficacy, the confidence that the adolescent express that smoking cessation could be achieved, revealed an inverse relationship to smoking dependence behavior. Conclusions and Implications: Self-efficacy was inversely associated with smoking dependence behavior in this sample, while altered mood states did not influence smoking dependence behavior or smoking consumption. This analysis suggests that enhancing self-efficacy should be tested {{as a part of}} the intervention for smoking prevention and cessation programs in adolescents...|$|R

40|$|Background and Objectives: Heart {{failure is}} a {{life-threatening}} illness in which panic disorder, <b>anxiety,</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>and</b> death expectation are constantly experienced. This study, thus, determined {{to examine the}} relationship between spiritual health <b>and</b> <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress in patients with heart failure. Methods: This study was a descriptive-correlational investigation that was performed on 150 patients with heart failure in selected Ardabil teaching hospitals in 2014. Data was collected using Demographic Questionnaire, Ellison-Paloutzian Spiritual Well-Being Scale, <b>and</b> <b>Depression,</b> <b>Anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> Stress Scale (DASS- 21). They were, then, analyzed using SPSS, descriptive statistical method, Pearson’s correlation coefficient, and multivariable regression analysis. Results: The results of this study showed that the spiritual wellbeing level of most subjects (75. 3 %) was in the range of medium. Mean scores of religious and existential aspects of spiritual well-being were obtained to be 33. 26 ± 1. 247 and 45. 76 ± 1. 328, respectively. In addition, <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress levels of most research units were in the medium range.

40|$|Objective University {{students}} {{are vulnerable to}} <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> other co-occurring mental disorders, but few receive treatment. Male university {{students are}} at particular risk of not receiving assistance. A better understanding of {{gender differences in the}} experience of depression may assist in improving its detection and the provision of appropriate support and prevention strategies. Accordingly, this study aimed to identify whether male and female university students have different patterns of self-reported <b>depression</b> <b>and</b> co-occurring <b>anxiety</b> <b>and</b> stress. Method A total of 1, 401 first year students from a regional Australian university completed the 21 -item version of the <b>Depression</b> <b>Anxiety</b> <b>and</b> Stress Scales. Data were collected in 2001, 2006, 2010, and 2012. Multidimensional scaling analyses were conducted to identify patterns of <b>depression,</b> <b>anxiety,</b> <b>and</b> stress in men and women with different depression severity.
