The advantage of TEM recording during <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>heating</b> is that it provides shorter exposure times (approximately 1  s) relative to the slower scans required by SE in the STEM modes. This allows higher accuracy and more reliable analysis of the atomic structure via computed diffractograms (sample drift and scan artifacts can strongly affect STEM diffractograms).

40|$|A {{document}} {{describes a}} high-performance thermal distribution panel (TDP) concept using high-conductivity (greater than 800 W/mK) macro composite skin with <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>heat</b> pipes. The processing technologies proposed to build such a panel {{result in a}} one-piece, inseparable assembly with high conductance in both the X and Y planes. The TDP configuration {{can also be used}} to produce panels with high structural stiffness. The one-piece construction of the TDP eliminates the thermal interface between the cooling plenums and the heat spreader base, and obviates the need for bulky mounting flanges and thick heat spreaders used on baseline designs. The conductivity of the TDP can be configured to exceed 800 W/mK with a mass density below 2. 5 grams per cubic centimeter. This material can provide efficient conductive heat transfer between the <b>in</b> <b>situ</b> <b>heat</b> plenums, permitting the use of thinner panel thicknesses. The plenums may be used as heat pipes, loop heat pipes, or liquid cooling channels.

APG is highly aligned crystalline graphite with an in-plane thermal conductivity of 1, 700 W/mK. APG has low shear strength and does not constrain the encapsulating material. The proposed concept has no thermal interfaces between the heat pipes and the spreader plate, further improving the overall conductance of the system.
