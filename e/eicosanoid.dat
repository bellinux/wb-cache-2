5|$|In recent years, {{evidence}} has emerged showing that lipid signaling {{is a vital}} part of the cell signaling. Lipid signaling may occur via activation of G protein-coupled or nuclear receptors, and members of several different lipid categories have been identified as signaling molecules and cellular messengers. These include sphingosine-1-phosphate, a sphingolipid derived from ceramide that is a potent messenger molecule involved in regulating calcium mobilization, cell growth, and apoptosis; diacylglycerol (DAG) and the phosphatidylinositol phosphates (PIPs), involved in calcium-mediated activation of protein kinase C; the prostaglandins, which are one type of fatty-acid derived <b>eicosanoid</b> involved in inflammation and immunity; the steroid hormones such as estrogen, testosterone and cortisol, which modulate a host of functions such as reproduction, metabolism and blood pressure; and the oxysterols such as 25-hydroxy-cholesterol that are liver X receptor agonists. Phosphatidylserine lipids are known to be involved in signaling for the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells or pieces of cells. They accomplish this by being exposed to the extracellular face of the cell membrane after the inactivation of flippases which place them exclusively on the cytosolic side and the activation of scramblases, which scramble the orientation of the phospholipids. After this occurs, other cells recognize the phosphatidylserines and phagocytosize the cells or cell fragments exposing them.|$|E

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Prostaglandins {{and related}} <b>eicosanoids</b> are oxygenated {{metabolites}} of C 20 polyunsaturated fatty acids. These compounds {{have been detected}} in species representing all major animal phyla. The significance of <b>eicosanoids</b> lies in two broad areas of animal biology. In one, <b>eicosanoids</b> are involved in regulation of many cellular events. In the other, <b>eicosanoids</b> facilitate certain ecological inter-actions. <b>Eicosanoids</b> are known best in the narrow context of their clinical signif-icance in human medicine. In this essay we suggest a new, broader paradigm for understanding the meaning of <b>eicosanoids.</b> Under this paradigm, called the biolog-ical paradigm, we note <b>eicosanoids</b> were recruited into roles as biological signal moieties long before {{the origins of the}} Metazoa. During the ensuing evolutionary diversification of animals, <b>eicosanoids</b> have been used in a vast diversity of biolog-ical roles, some of which occur only in invertebrates. We think this diversity en-dows <b>eicosanoids</b> with unusual explanatory power in apprehending biological phe-nomena. In this review, we recount the literature on <b>eicosanoids</b> in protozoans and procaryotes, then provide a detailed review of the roles of <b>eicosanoids</b> in inverte...|$|R

40|$|These studies {{demonstrate}} that pathogenic fungi (dermatophytic, subcutaneous, and systemic) {{have the ability}} to produce <b>eicosanoids</b> both from simple metabolites and from arachidonic acid. Host-derived <b>eicosanoids</b> have been previously demonstrated to enhance fungal colonization and atopic disease development. Thus, fungus-derived <b>eicosanoids</b> represent a potential class of novel virulence factors...|$|R
25|$|Oxidation {{by either}} COX or {{lipoxygenase}} releases {{reactive oxygen species}} (ROS) and the initial products in <b>eicosanoid</b> generation are themselves highly reactive peroxides. LTA4 can form adducts with tissue DNA. Other reactions of lipoxygenases generate cellular damage; murine models implicate 15-lipoxygenase in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids are potent anti-inflammatories, {{regardless}} of the inflammation's cause; their primary anti-inflammatory mechanism is lipocortin-1 (annexin-1) synthesis. Lipocortin-1 both suppresses phospholipase A2, thereby blocking <b>eicosanoid</b> production, and inhibits various leukocyte inflammatory events (epithelial adhesion, emigration, chemotaxis, phagocytosis, respiratory burst, etc.). In other words, glucocorticoids not only suppress immune response, but also inhibit the two main products of inflammation, prostaglandins and leukotrienes. They inhibit prostaglandin synthesis {{at the level of}} phospholipase A2 {{as well as at the}} level of cyclooxygenase/PGE isomerase (COX-1 and COX-2), the latter effect being much like that of NSAIDs, potentiating the anti-inflammatory effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{metabolic}} syndrome can be induced by overfeeding with sugar or fructose, particularly concomitantly with high-fat diet. The resulting oversupply of omega-6 fatty acids, particularly arachidonic acid (AA), {{is an important}} factor in the pathogenesis of {{metabolic syndrome}}. Arachidonic acid (with its precursor - linoleic acid) serve as a substrate to the production of inflammatory mediators known as eicosanoids, whereas the arachidonic acid-containing compound diacylglycerol (DAG) is a precursor to the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-AG) while fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) mediates the metabolism of arachidonic acid into anandamide. Anandamide can also be produced from N-acylphosphatidylethanolamine via several pathways. Anandamide and 2-AG can also be hydrolized into arachidonic acid, potentially leading to increased <b>eicosanoid</b> synthesis.|$|E
40|$|Oxylipins are oxygenated {{metabolites}} of fatty acids. <b>Eicosanoids</b> are {{a subset}} of oxylipins and include the prostaglandins and leukotrienes, which are potent regulators of host immune responses. Host cells are one source of <b>eicosanoids</b> and oxylipins during infection; however, another potential source of <b>eicosanoids</b> is the pathogen itself. A broad range of pathogenic fungi, protozoa, and helminths produce <b>eicosanoids</b> and other oxylipins by novel synthesis pathways. Why do these organisms produce oxylipins? Accumulating data suggest that phase change and differentiation in these organisms are controlled by oxylipins, including prostaglandins and lipoxygenase products. The precise role of pathogen-derived <b>eicosanoids</b> in pathogenesis remains to be determined, but the potential link between pathogen <b>eicosanoids</b> {{and the development of}} TH 2 responses in the host is intriguing. Mammalian prostaglandins and leukotrienes have been studied extensively, and these molecules can modulate Th 1 versus Th 2 immune responses, chemokine production, phagocytosis, lymphocyte proliferation, and leukocyte chemotaxis. Thus, <b>eicosanoids</b> and oxylipins (host or microbe) may be mediators of a direct host-pathogen “cross-talk” that promotes chronic infection and hypersensitivity disease, common features of infection by eukaryotic pathogens...|$|R
50|$|In the Repair phase, new {{tissue is}} {{generated}} {{which requires a}} balance of anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory <b>eicosanoids.</b> Anti-inflammatory <b>eicosanoids</b> include lipoxins, epi-lipoxins, and resolvins, which cause release of growth hormones.|$|R
5000|$|GLA is {{converted}} to dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA), which in turn {{is converted}} to arachidonic acid (AA). One of the possible fates of AA is to be transformed into a group of metabolites called <b>eicosanoids</b> during the inflammatory response and during physical activity; <b>eicosanoids</b> are a class of paracrine hormones. The three types of <b>eicosanoids</b> are prostaglandins, thromboxanes, and leukotrienes. <b>Eicosanoids</b> produced from AA tend to promote (not cause) inflammation and promote growth during and after physical activity in healthy humans. [...] For example, both AA-derived thrombaxane and leukotrieneB4 are proaggregatory and vasoconstrictive <b>eicosanoids</b> during inflammation. The oxidized metabolic products of linoleic acid, such as 9-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid and 13-hydroxyoctadecanoic acid, have also been shown to activate TRPV1, the capsaicin receptor, and through this might {{play a major role in}} hyperalgesia and allodynia.|$|R
25|$|The prostaglandins are {{synthesized}} in {{the cell}} membrane by the cleavage of arachidonate from the phospholipids {{that make up the}} membrane. This is catalyzed either by phospholipase A2 acting directly on a membrane phospholipid, or by a lipase acting on DAG (diacyl-glycerol). The arachidonate is then acted upon by the cyclooxygenase component of prostaglandin synthase. This forms a cyclopentane ring in roughly the middle of the fatty acid chain. The reaction also adds 4 oxygen atoms derived from two molecules of O2. The resulting molecule is prostaglandin G2 which is converted by the hydroperoxidase component of the enzyme complex into prostaglandin H2. This highly unstable compound is rapidly transformed into other prostaglandins, prostacyclin and thromboxanes. These are then released into the interstitial fluids surrounding the cells that have manufactured the <b>eicosanoid</b> hormone.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eicosanoid</b> {{biosynthesis}} {{begins when}} a cell is activated by mechanical trauma, ischemia, other physical perturbations, attack by pathogens, or stimuli made by nearby cells, tissues, or pathogens such as chemotactic factors, cytokines, growth factors, and even certain eicosanoids. The activated cells then mobilize enzymes, termed phospholipase A2's (PLA2s), capable of releasing ω-6 and ω-3 fatty acids from membrane storage. These fatty acids are bound in ester linkage to the SN2 position of membrane phospholipids; PLA2s act as esterases {{to release the}} fatty acid. There are several classes of PLA2s with type IV cytosolic PLA2s (cPLA2s) appearing {{to be responsible for}} releasing the fatty acids under many conditions of cell activation. The cPLA2s act specifically on phospholipids that contain AA, EPA or GPLA at their SN2 position. Interestingly, cPLA2 may also release the lysophospholipid that becomes platelet-activating factor.|$|E
25|$|Fatty acids: Gamma-linolenic acid, an omega-6 fatty acid, {{may reduce}} pain, tender joint count and stiffness, and is {{generally}} safe. For omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (found in fish oil), a meta-analysis reported a favorable effect on pain, although {{confidence in the}} effect was considered moderate. The same review reported less inflammation but no difference in joint function. A review examined the effect of marine oil omega-3 fatty acids on pro-inflammatory <b>eicosanoid</b> concentrations; leukotriene4 (LTB4) was lowered in people with rheumatoid arthritis but not in those with non-autoimmune chronic diseases. (LTB4) increases vascular permeabiltity and stimulates other inflammatory substances. A third meta-analysis looked at fish consumption. The result was a weak, non-statistically significant inverse association between fish consumption and RA. A fourth review limited inclusion to trials in which people eat ≥2.7 g/day {{for more than three}} months. Use of pain relief medication was decreased, but improvements in tender or swollen joints, morning stiffness and physical function were not changed. Collectively, the current evidence is not strong enough to determine that supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids or regular consumption of fish are effective treatments for rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
5000|$|In 1964 it was {{discovered}} that enzymes found in sheep tissues convert omega-6 arachidonic acid into the inflammatory agent called prostaglandin E2 which both causes the sensation of pain and expedites healing and immune response in traumatized and infected tissues. By 1979 more of what are now known as <b>eicosanoids</b> were discovered: thromboxanes, prostacyclins, and the leukotrienes. The <b>eicosanoids,</b> which have important biological functions, typically have a short active lifetime in the body, starting with synthesis from fatty acids and ending with metabolism by enzymes. If the rate of synthesis exceeds the rate of metabolism, the excess <b>eicosanoids</b> may, however, have deleterious effects. Researchers found that certain omega-3 fatty acids are also converted into <b>eicosanoids,</b> but at a much slower rate. <b>Eicosanoids</b> made from omega-3 fatty acids are often referred to as anti-inflammatory, but in fact they are just less inflammatory than those made from omega-6 fats. If both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids are present, they will [...] "compete" [...] to be transformed, so the ratio of long-chain omega-3:omega-6 fatty acids directly affects the type of <b>eicosanoids</b> that are produced.|$|R
50|$|The gene {{encoding}} cytosolic phospholipase A2-α {{is found}} on chromosome 1. Cytosolic phospholipase A2-α acts on membrane phospholipids to release arachidonic acid a precursor in {{the synthesis of}} <b>eicosanoids.</b> The <b>eicosanoids</b> are involved in multiple regulatory pathways.|$|R
40|$|The {{review is}} {{dedicated}} to modern concepts of arachidonic acid metabolites, i. e., endocannabinoids and <b>eicosanoids,</b> their biosynthetic pathways, cross-talk mechanisms and participation in immune response. New information from literature and own results include data concerning overlapping enzymatic pathways controlling biosynthesis of endocannabinoids and <b>eicosanoids.</b> Impact of synthetic cannabinoid receptor ligands upon production rates of proinflammatory cytokines and <b>eicosanoids</b> is discussed, as like as relationships among immune system reactivity and expression levels of cannabinoid receptors...|$|R
25|$|There are {{multiple}} subfamilies of eicosanoids, including most prominently the prostaglandins, thromboxanes, leukotrienes, lipoxins, resolvins, and eoxins but also others {{as noted in}} the following Nomenclature section. For each subfamily, there is the potential to have at least 5 separate series of metabolites, two series derived from ω-6 PUFAs (arachidonic and dihomo-gamma-linolenic acids), one series derived from the ω-3 PUFA (eicosapentaenoic acid), and one series derived from the ω-9 PUFA (mead acid). This subfamily distinction is important. Mammals, including humans, are unable to convert ω-6 into ω-3 PUFA. In consequence, tissue levels of the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFAs and their corresponding <b>eicosanoid</b> metabolites link directly to the amount of dietary ω-6 versus ω-3 PUFAs consumed. Since certain of the ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA series of metabolites have almost diametrically opposing physiological and pathological activities, it has often been suggested that the deleterious consequences associated with the consumption of ω-6 PUFA-rich diets reflects excessive production and activities of ω-6 PUFA-derived eicosanoids while the beneficial effects associated with the consumption of ω-3 PUFA-rich diets reflect the excessive production and activities of ω-3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids. In this view, the opposing effects of ω-6 PUFA-derived and ω-3 PUFA-derived eicosanoids on key target cells underlie the detrimental and beneficial effects of ω-6 and ω-3 PUFA-rich diets on inflammation and allergy reactions, atherosclerosis, hypertension, cancer growth, {{and a host of other}} processes.|$|E
25|$|Both COX1 and COX2 (also termed prostaglandin-endoperoxide synthase-1 (PTGS1) and PTGS2, respectively) metabolize {{arachidonic acid}} by adding {{molecular}} O2 between carbons 9 and 11 {{to form an}} endoperoxide bridge between these two carbons, adding molecular O2 to carbon 15 to yield a 15-hydroperoxy product, creating a carbon-carbon bond between carbons 8 and 12 to create a cyclopentane ring {{in the middle of}} the fatty acid, and in the process making PGG2, a product that has two fewer double bonds than arachidonic acid. The 15-hydrpperoxy residue of PGG2 is then reduced to a 15-hydroxyl residue thereby forming PGH2. PGH2 is the parent prostanoid to all other postanoids. It is metabolized by (see diagram in Prostanoids: a) the Prostaglandin E synthase pathway in which any one of three isozymes, PTGES, PTGES2, or PTGES3, convert PGH2 to PGE2 (subsequent products of this pathway include PGA2 and PGB2 (see Prostanoid#Biosynthesis); b) PGF synthase which converts PGH2 to PGF2α; c) Prostaglandin D2 synthase which converts PGH2 to PGD2 (subsequent products in this pathway include 15-dPGJ2 (see Cyclopentenone prostaglandin); d) thromboxane synthase which converts PGH2 to TXA2 (subsequent products in this pathway include TXB2); and e) Prostacyclin synthase which converts PGH2 to PGI2 (subsequent products in this pathway include 6-keto-PGFα. These pathways have been shown or in some cases presumed to metabolize eicosapentaenoic acid to <b>eicosanoid</b> analogs of the sited products that have three rather than two double bonds and therefore contain the number 3 in place of 2 attached to their names (e.g. PGE3 instead of PGE2).|$|E

The jack jumper have been compared to other highly aggressive ant species, such as [...] Brachyponera chinensis, Brachyponera sennaarensis, and the red imported fire ant (Solenopsis invicta). The retractable sting is located in their abdomen, attached to a single venom gland connected by the venom sac, which is where the venom is accumulated.
