50|$|According to the International Institute for Strategic Studies (IISS), in 2010 the Turkish Armed Forces had {{an active}} {{strength}} of around 510,000 personnel. In addition, {{it was estimated}} that there were 378,700 reserve personnel and 152,200 paramilitary personnel (Turkish Gendarmerie and Turkish Coast Guard), giving a combined active and reserve strength of around 1,041,900 personnel. In 2010, the defence budget amounted to 26 billion liras. The Law on the Court of Accounts was supposed to initiate external <b>ex-post</b> <b>audits</b> of armed forces' expenditure and pave the way for audits of extra budgetary resources earmarked for the defence sector, including the Defence Industry Support Fund. However, the Ministry of Defense has not provided the necessary information, so the armed forces expenditure is not being properly checked.|$|E
30|$|In the Austrian HM project, only {{enterprises}} falling {{under the}} responsibility of the large business auditing unit could apply, which generally included all businesses with annual turnovers over ten million Euro. After applying for HM, companies underwent an initial audit to assess their suitability for the project. To be admitted, companies also had to implement a tax control framework and had to demonstrate a reliable tax strategy in the past (Schrittwieser and Woischitzschläger 2014; Stiastny 2015). Following admittance, company representatives signed a declaration of intent together with the Austrian tax authorities. From a legal perspective, the relationship between companies and the tax authorities remained largely unchanged (Bundesministerium für Finanzen 2012; Stiastny 2015). Indeed, HM was mainly based on trust and voluntary cooperation between the two parties: Companies committed to acting transparently and to developing their internal tax risk management, while tax authorities refrained from conducting <b>ex-post</b> <b>audits</b> and provided non-binding advice and interpretations on current taxation issues.|$|E
40|$|Estonian {{authorities}} have made remarkable progress {{in a relatively}} short period of time by putting into place the elements of a modern budget process and fiscal management system. This progress is especially notable given the difficult circumstances the country has gone through in the transition period of the last five years. The most significant changes in budgetary policy took place with the adoption of the Law on State Budget in June 1993. Several other pieces of legislation have come to complement the Budget Law including laws on local budgets, state external audit and the department of treasury. Other reforms have helped establish the basis of a modern fiscal management system. These include a monetary board assuring the independence of monetary policy from fiscal management and eliminating all possibilities of inflationary deficit financing, a well designed and impressively simple tax code, an overall well designed system of decentralized government, and the privatization of many state enterprises. However, there are still significant steps that need to be taken for making the government budget and the budget process itself effective instruments of fiscal management in Estonia. In some cases, the new budget institutions are at the early stages of development and appear fragile because of lack of resources or trained personnel and lack of tradition. In other cases, the proper institutions for fiscal management have not been developed or are lacking. Addressing these reform issues should significantly enhance the ability of the Government of Estonia to accomplish its objectives of macroeconomic stability, a more efficient allocation of public funds, and growth of the economy’s private sector. This report takes stock and evaluates the reforms in fiscal management already introduced, those scheduled for introduction, and those that the Government still should consider putting in place to accomplish an effective fiscal management system. Because they have been reviewed recently, this report does not discuss in depth existing budget institutions but instead puts emphasis on recent reform and highlights those problem areas where additional reforms will be necessary. The first section of the report provides a brief overview of the main accomplishments and failings of Estonia’s budget process and fiscal management system. The next three sections of the report review in more depth the three stages of the budget process: policy formulation, forecasting and budget preparation; budget execution and the ongoing effort to introduce a modern treasury function in the Ministry of Finance; and the institutions for budget compliance, namely internal and external <b>ex-post</b> <b>audits</b> and budget evaluation.

50|$|The Council of State is a legal-administrative {{consultative body}} and it oversees the {{administration}} of justice. The Court of Accounts exercises preventive control over the legitimacy of Government measures, and also <b>ex-post</b> <b>auditing</b> of {{the administration of}} the State budget.

It reports directly to Parliament on the results of audits performed. The law ensures the independence from the Government of the two bodies and of their members.|$|R
40|$|We provide {{evidence}} from a large-scale field experiment on the causal effects of audit regimes on compliance {{in a market}} for immediate (home and nursing) care. In this setting care should be provided quickly and, therefore, the gatekeeper introduced <b>ex-post</b> <b>auditing.</b> Our results do not show significant effects of variations in audit regimes with different unconditional audit rates and switching to a conditional audit regime on {{the quantity and quality}} of applications for immediate care. We also do not find evidence for heterogeneous effects across care providers differing in size or hospital status. Our preferred explanation for the lack of audit regime effects is the absence of direct sanctions for noncompliance. The observed divergence of audit rates in the conditional audit regime is the consequence of sorting rather than behavioral responses...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{sets the}} {{background}} to the Special Issue of the Journal of Empirical Finance on Challenges of Corporate Governance. It identifies the alternative approaches {{that can be taken}} to solve agency problems stemming from asymmetries of information: (i) <b>ex-post</b> monitoring through <b>audit</b> and information provision, (ii) ex-ante monitoring through boards, and (iii) incentivisation through the alignment of managerial incentives with shareholders. It discusses how the UK and the US have responded to corporate failures and relates the development of regulation in these countries to the three alternative approaches. It concludes with a discussion of three groups of challenges: (i) understanding alternative regulatory approaches, (ii) determining the importance of geo-diversity of business culture, and (iii) overcoming the problems of the political economy of corporate governance...|$|R
40|$|People tend to {{interact}} {{and communicate with}} others throughout their life. In the age of pervasive computing, information and communication technology (ICT) {{that is no longer}} bound to desktop computers enables digital cooperations in everyday life and work in an unprecedented manner. However, the privacy and IT security issues inherent in pervasive computing are often associated with negative consequences for the users and the (information) society as a whole. Addressing this challenge, this thesis demonstrates that carefully devised protection mechanisms can become enablers for multilaterally acceptable and trustworthy digital interactions and cooperations. It contributes to the design of multilaterally secure cooperative pervasive systems by taking a scenario-oriented approach. Within our reference scenario of ICT-supported emergency response, we derive the following scientific research questions. Firstly, we investigate how to enable real-world auditing in pervasive location tracking systems, while striking a balance between privacy protection and accountability. Secondly, we aim to support communication between a sender and mobile receivers that are unknown by identity, while end-to-end security is enforced. The required concepts and mechanisms define the scope of what we denote as multilaterally secure pervasive cooperation. We take a novel integrated approach and provide the supporting security techniques and mechanisms. The main contributions of this thesis are (i) pseudonyms with implicit attributes, which is an approach to multilevel linkable transaction pseudonyms that is based on a combination of threshold encryption techniques, secure multiparty computation and cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generators, (ii) multilaterally secure location-based auditing, a novel consideration of auditing mechanisms in the context of real-world actions that reconciles privacy protection and accountability while proposing location traces as evidence, (iii) a hybrid encryption technique for expressive policies, which allows encrypting under policies that include a continuous dynamic attribute, leveraging an efficient combination of ciphertext-policy attribute-based encryption, location-based encryption and symmetric encryption concepts, and (iv) end-to-end secure attribute-based messaging, a communication mechanism for end-to-end confidential messaging with receivers unknown by identity that is suitable also for resource constrained mobile devices. Harnessing these buildings blocks, we present an integrated architecture that supports location-aware first response. We therein consider location as the central integrating concept for pervasive cooperations. Both communication during incident handling as well as <b>ex-post</b> <b>auditing</b> are conceived as being location-based. Our research draws from experiences with potential real users (first responders and emergency decision makers) and from an interdisciplinary study. We contribute results derived from simulated court cases, indicating the trustworthiness and practicality of our proposal. Experiments conducted with prototype systems support the claim that our concepts are suitable for resource-constrained devices. In a theoretical analysis, we show that our security requirements are fulfilled. Our proposals have multiple further applications, e. g. to pseudonym-based access control...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{experimentally}} examines a new auditing rule {{termed the}} bounded rule, which {{takes into account}} the budget constraint of the auditor (e. g., a tax authority). Compared to a traditional rule that audits income reports with a constant probability, the bounded rule can induce the same deterrence e¤ect with a smaller budget. The basic setting follows a classic tax-compliance game in which each taxpayer receives either high or low income with certain probability. On knowing an auditing rule, the taxpayers have to decide simultaneously and independently whether to report their income truthfully to the auditor. The traditional rule audits every low-income report with a constant probability. The bounded rule audits a randomly selected sample of low-income reports whenever the number of these reports exceeds the maximum number of audits allowed by the budget, or otherwise all of the low-income reports. The experimental evidence suggests that, as predicted, the two auditing rules have the same deterrence e¤ect. The bounded rule needs a smaller budget ex-ante, and conducts fewer <b>audits</b> <b>ex-post.</b> The results provide support for the bounded rule as a more cost-e¤ective alternative to the traditional rule. ...|$|R
40|$|In the {{management}} discipline, scholarly impact is most commonly measured using a researcher perspective, by counting {{the number of}} times a particular article is mentioned in the references section of other articles (Aguinis, Shapiro, Antonacopoulou, and Cummings, 2014). This approach conceptualizes scholarly impact using a measurable indicator, the citation count an article receives. Several studies have been conducted to examine what drives scholarly impact in the field of management. The originality of the idea, rigor of the study, and clarity of writing have been identified as the most significant universalistic parameters of scholarly impact (Judge, Colbert, Cable, and Rynes, 2007). This dissertation sets out to do a detailed examination of these parameters. The six articles included in the thesis do so in two ways: either by offering recommendations for improving these universalistic parameters of scholarly impact or by further exploring the relationship between the universalistic parameters and scholarly impact. Our first empirical article, here relayed in Chapter II, focuses on case studies, and analyzes the methodological rigor of all case studies published during the period 1996 - 2006. We point out different types of replication logic, and illustrate how their individual research actions have differential effects on the internal and external validity (in that order of priority) of the emerging theory. Chapter III follows up on the previous chapter, extending the investigation to quantitative as well as qualitative research, and offers replication logic as a tool for analyzing deviant cases identified {{during the course of a}} qualitative or quantitative study. We call this technique the ‘Deviant Case Method’ (‘DCM’). Through this study, we explain the theoretical consequentiality (Aguinis et al., 2013; Cortina, 2002) of analyzing three different kinds of outliers (construct, model fit, and prediction outliers/ deviant cases) and offer DCM for analyzing prediction outliers/deviant cases. In Chapter IV, we extend this method to have a look at medium-N studies. Here we focus on inconsistent or deviant cases which turn up during a fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA). We offer a method called ‘Comparative Outlier Analysis’ (‘COA’) which combines DCM and Mill’s canons (1875) to examine these multitude of inconsistent cases. We explicate this using exemplars from fields like politics, marketing, and education. Unlike in other disciplines or methods, it is far from clear what the label ‘transparent research procedures’ constitutes in management field studies, with adverse effects during write-up, revision, and even after publication. To rectify this, in Chapter V, we review field studies across seven major management journals (1997 - 2006) in order to develop a transparency index, and link it to article impact. Chapter VI is a sequel to the previous chapter. We propose a new method for assessing the methodological rigor of grounded theory procedures <b>ex-post</b> using an <b>audit</b> trail perspective. While existing research on the methodological sophistication of grounded theory was typically done from the perspective of the author or producer of the research, our perspective is customer-centric, both in terms of the end-customer (i. e. the reader or other author), as well as the intermediate customer (i. e. reviewers and editors). The last empirical article in the thesis, Chapter VII, focuses on yet another parameter influencing impact: the style of academic writing. Specifically, we focus on the attributes of article titles and their subsequent influence on the citation count. At this early stage of theory development on article titles, we do this in the specific application context of management science. We conclude with Chapter VIII where we sum up the findings and implications of all preceding studies and put forth suggestions for future research...|$|R
