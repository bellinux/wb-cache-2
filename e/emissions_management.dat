40|$|A new cost-based control {{strategy}} is presented that optimizes engine-aftertreatment performance under all operating conditions. This Integrated <b>Emission</b> <b>Management</b> strategy minimizes fuel consumption within the set emission limits by on-line adjustment of air management {{based on the}} actual state of the exhaust gas aftertreatment system. Following a model-based approach, Integrated <b>Emission</b> <b>Management</b> offers a framework for future {{control strategy}} development. This approach alleviates calibration complexity, since it allows to make optimal trade-offs in an operational cost sense. The potential of the presented cost-optimal control strategy is demonstrated for a modern heavy-duty Euro VI engine. The studied diesel engine is equipped with cooled EGR, Variable Geometry Turbocharger, and a DPF-SCR aftertreatment system. A simulation study shows that the proposed Integrated <b>Emission</b> <b>Management</b> strategy accomplishes 2 % to 3 % reduction in fuel consumption and operating costs compared to a baseline strategy. Further potential benefits include reduced heat rejection associated with the EGR system and reduced DPF regeneration frequency. © 2011 SAE International...|$|R
30|$|From {{the above}} analysis, we can {{conclude}} that the solutions worked out from the ITSDP are value for making decisions of energy resources allocation, capacity expansion of power and heat generation as well as pollutants <b>emission</b> <b>management.</b> In the progress of decision alternatives generation, the interval solutions are effective to represent various options which reflect environmental-economic trades off. Cost-effective options can be obtained with a least-cost strategy though planning pollutants <b>emission</b> <b>management</b> in regional electricity and heat supply. However, if pollutants emission reduction is considered, the pre-regulated targets of electricity and heat supply from various technologies have to be reallocated, the pre-arranged capacity expansion options of power and heat generation technologies would be reselected.|$|R

40|$|A {{new concept}} is {{introduced}} {{to optimize the}} performance of the entire powertrain: Integrated Powertrain Control (IPC). In this concept, the synergy between engine, driveline and aftertreatment system is exploited by integrated energy and <b>emission</b> <b>management.</b> As a result, fuel efficiency and drivability can be optimized simultaneously within the boundaries set by emission legislation. This is essential to meet both future CO 2 targets and ultra low emission limits. As a first step towards IPC, the potential of the proposed approach is demonstrated for a series hybrid diesel passenger car. The studied powertrain is based on a VW 1. 2 l TDI engine, which is equipped with a urea-based SCR-deNOx aftertreatment system. For three different energy management strategies, chassis dynamometer results are presented over a European NEDC test cycle. Additional simulations demonstrate the potential of integrated energy and <b>emission</b> <b>management,</b> especially during low temperature conditions. Projections show that 130 g/km CO 2 and Euro- 6 NOx emission targets can be simultaneously met for the studied C-segment vehicle. © 2009 AACC...|$|R
40|$|Energy {{management}} in modern vehicles typically relates to optimizing the powerflow in the (hybrid) powertrain, whereas <b>emission</b> <b>management</b> {{is associated with}} the combustion engine and its aftertreatment system. To achieve maximum performance in both fuel economy and hazardous emissions, the concept of Integrated Powertrain Control (IPC) is presented. This paper presents an overview of TNOs IPC roadmap. It is shown how system integration takes a dominant role in the near future and how complexity of the powertrain is handled in a structured way. The potential benefit of IPC ís demonstrated for a commercial hybrid delivery truck case study. Based on simulations with a validated powertrain model, analysis is carried out considering the trade-off between energy <b>management</b> and <b>emission</b> <b>management.</b> It is demonstrated that the CO 2 emissions and related operational costs allow for a reduction of 3. 5 %, whereas NOx emissions can be reduced up to 27 %. The added value of IPC is that it targets the NOx emissions exactly at the boundary set by emission legislatíon whereas the remaining freedom is used to achieve lowest operational costs...|$|R
40|$|The <b>emission</b> rights <b>management</b> module of the {{software}} package “CO 2 -Navigator“ is a corporate <b>emissions</b> rights <b>management</b> instrument designed to {{provide an overview of}} the allocation and transactions of CO 2 emission allowances at any time of the calendar year. During the acquisition, the relevant dates, quantities and prices are collected. The daily updated inventory of allowances is also reported. Based on {{the current state of the}} emissions from an installation, an estimate of the allowance coverage for the balance sheet day of the current year is realized, using an emission profile characteristic for the firm. Here, a possible under- or over- coverage is graphically illustrated and quantified. The module is thus a useful tool in the risk <b>management</b> process of <b>emission</b> intensive companies. A possible subsequent investment analysis, e. g. a stochastic investment planning, builds on the data supplied by this module.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based control and calibration design method for online cost-based optimization of engine-aftertreatment operation under all operating conditions. The so-called Integrated <b>Emission</b> <b>Management</b> (IEM) strategy online minimizes the fuel and AbBlue consumption. Based {{on the actual}} state of engine and aftertreatment systems, optimal air management settings are determined for EGR-SCR balancing. Following a model-based approach, the strategy allows for a systematic control design and calibration procedure for engine and aftertreatment systems. The potential of this time efficient method is demonstrated by experiments for a heavy-duty Euro-VI engine. The Integrated <b>Emission</b> <b>Management</b> strategy is developed and calibrated offline over a cold and hot World Harmonized Transient Cycle (WHTC) for the set emission targets. The total IEM development and calibration process takes approximately 20 weeks from model identification to the acceptance tests. Moreover, by only changing the software settings, the existing hardware performance increases: the WHTC results show a 1. 1 % operational cost reduction and corresponding 1. 4 % fuel consumption reduction (and by that CO 2) compared to the baseline Euro-VI strategy. Further potential benefits include reduced heat rejection in the EGR system and reduced DPF regeneration frequency. The presented approach offers also a generic framework for future extension with Waste Heat Recovery and hybrid electric drivetrain functions: Integrated <b>Emission</b> and Energy <b>Management.</b> Copyright © 2013 SAE International...|$|R

5000|$|In July 2007, Alberta {{enacted the}} Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, Alta. Reg. 139/2007, (SGER). This carbon tax [...] {{requires}} a $15/tonne contribution {{be made to}} the [...] "Climate Change and <b>Emissions</b> <b>Management</b> Fund" [...] (CCEMF) by companies that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas annually to either reduce their CO2 emissions per barrel by 12 percent, or buy an offset in Alberta to apply against their total emissions.In January 2016, the contribution required by large emitters to the CCEMF was increased by the provincial government to $20/tonne.The tax will fall most heavily on oil companies and coal-fired electricity plants. It intends to give companies a real incentive to lower emissions while fostering technology that makes the job easier. The plan only covers the largest companies that produce 70% of Alberta's emissions. There are concerns that this is a serious omission because the smallest energy producers are often the most casual about emissions and pollution. The carbon tax is currently $20 per tonne. Because Alberta has the highest greenhouse gas emissions in Canada the majority of Albertans are strongly opposed to a nationwide carbon tax. There is a fear that a nationwide carbon tax would cause Alberta's economy to suffer significantly more in proportion to other provinces. Alberta is also opposed to a Cap and Trade system it fears the trades will pull revenue out of the province, a fear not to be dismissed. Alberta's local carbon price allows the money to stay within Alberta.|$|E

30|$|Without ILP, the {{pollutants}} <b>emission</b> <b>management</b> {{and programming}} problem {{can also be}} solved by fixed-mix stochastic programming approach though adopting their mid-point values instead of the interval parameters. Undoubtedly further sensitivity analysis could be undertaken, but the model still cannot efficiently reflect the interactions among these uncertainties because each solution can only provide a single result corresponding to variations of the uncertain inputs. Likewise, if best/worst sub-models are solved, we can only obtain two solutions under extreme scenarios (best condition and worst condition). They are serviceable to judge the possibility that desired goal realizes but not necessarily build a series of stable intervals for decision variables.|$|R
