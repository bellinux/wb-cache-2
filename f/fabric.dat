5|$|The raw wound <b>fabric</b> of silk or cotton was fed {{from large}} rollers into Myers' {{varnishing}} machine for processing. The processed wet <b>fabric,</b> soaked with varnish, was rubbed and pressed so the varnish {{would go into}} all the pores. The excess varnish was then removed and the wet <b>fabric</b> cloth hung outdoors in bright sunshine for 6 to 12 hours like laundry. The processed <b>fabric</b> had the elastic properties of rubber. This patented varnish that Myers invented was able to seal the balloon material to hold the hydrogen gas, that otherwise would penetrate even glass and metal. The silk or cloth <b>fabric</b> used required eight to ten applications of the varnish to seal properly to be thoroughly impervious to hydrogen gas.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Knitted <b>fabrics</b> {{have been}} widely used in {{different}} fields due to their high strength and elastic properties. However, these can only be used in limited applications due to poor liquid absorption owing to the large pore size of knitted <b>fabrics.</b> This study is focused on the structural characteristics of micro- and nano-filament warp as well as weft knitted <b>fabrics.</b> Nano-filament <b>fabrics</b> are manufactured by means of alkali treatment. Filament diameters are significantly reduced according to SEM micrographs. The decreased porosity of nano-filament <b>fabrics</b> indicates that nano-filament knitted <b>fabrics</b> possess excellent water absorptive capacity due to capillary action in the <b>fabrics.</b> Tensile behaviors of knitted <b>fabrics</b> in the wale and course directions are investigated as well...|$|R

5|$|Generally, {{the uniform}} jacket of the Confederate soldier was single breasted, made of gray or brown <b>fabric,</b> with a {{six to nine}} button front. The design of the garment {{featured}} several variations: a four to six piece body, {{and one or two}} piece sleeves, usually with lining, often of a cotton material. The <b>fabric</b> used in these jackets, ranged from the finer kerseys and broadcloths used early in the war, to the cotton/wool blends of jeans, satinette, and cassimere, to name several examples. The exact color of the <b>fabric</b> also ranged from the prewar bright cadet gray, similar to the <b>fabric</b> used by Virginia Military Institute, or West Point U.S. Military Academy dress uniforms, to the sumac and logwood dyed fabrics, that would eventually fade to the ragged butternut appearance. Epaulettes may have been used {{in the construction of the}} jacket, as was the case for the Richmond clothing bureau designed jackets, commonly called today, the Richmond Depot types I, II, and III. Belt loops were also in intermittent use, such as the Richmond and the Charleston clothing depots. Trimming on the jackets range from piped or taped collars, cuffs, and front lapel edges, to full facings on the collar and cuffs, commonly in light blue, dark blue, red, or black. Due to the difficulty in obtaining yellow dye ingredients as the war progressed, yellow was infrequently used by the Cavalry Corps throughout the conflict.|$|E

40|$|Biological {{environmentally}} friendly concepts are emerging to replace chemical treatments of <b>fabrics.</b> In this work, a new {{process for the}} coloration of flax <b>fabrics</b> via enzymatic oxidation of natural flavonoids (morin, quercetin) has been developed. Laccase from Trametes hirsuta is able to react with flavonoids and polymerize them, resulting in a strongly colored polymeric solution which {{can be applied to}} the coloration of flax <b>fabrics.</b> Two methods were investigated: (i) the simultaneous enzymatic polymerization and coloration of <b>fabrics</b> and (ii) the polymerization of flavonoids with laccase, followed by a further coloration of the flax <b>fabrics.</b> Factors such as temperature, reaction time, presence of NaCl or the use of bleached or unbleached <b>fabrics</b> were evaluated in order to increase the color of the <b>fabrics</b> and the color fastness. The increase of temperature, the presence of salt and the use of unbleached <b>fabrics</b> allowed the final color to be improved. Colorized flax <b>fabrics</b> with oxidized quercetin solution showed a color fixation two times higher than the <b>fabrics</b> colorized with oxidized morin. Finally, the polymerization of flavonoids and their binding to fibers were verified using Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR).

5|$|Petticoats made of {{horsehair}} crinoline appeared around 1839, proving {{so successful}} that the name 'crinoline' began to refer to supportive petticoats in general, rather than solely to the material.

One alternative to horsehair crinoline was the quilted petticoat stuffed with down or feathers, such as that reportedly worn in 1842 by Lady Aylesbury. However, quilted skirts were not widely produced until the early 1850s. In about 1849, it was possible to buy stiffened and corded cotton <b>fabric</b> for making petticoats, marketed as 'crinoline,' and designed as a substitute for the horsehair textile.
