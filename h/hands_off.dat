5|$|Jerry Lynn was Special Guest Referee for {{the next}} {{encounter}} between A.J. Styles and Sean Waltman. Styles bleed from the nose during the match. Styles gained a near-fall on Waltman after performing his signature Styles Clash maneuver and slamming Waltman face-first into the mat. Waltman also gained a near-fall following his signature X-Factor maneuver and forcing Styles face-first into the mat. Later, Styles jumped from the ring apron over the top rope and Waltman in a sunset flip. Waltman held onto the ropes, trying to prevent a pin attempt, until Lynn kicked his <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> the top rope. Styles then rolled through and lifted Waltman up to perform the Styles Clash at 14 minutes and 37 seconds to win the competition.|$|E
5|$|After {{mismanagement}} {{during the}} late 1980s, Hibs were {{on the brink of}} financial ruin in 1990. Wallace Mercer, the chairman of Hearts, proposed a merger of the two clubs, but the Hibs fans believed that the proposal was more like a hostile takeover. They formed the <b>Hands</b> <b>off</b> Hibs group to campaign for the continued existence of the club. This succeeded when a prominent local businessman, Kwik-Fit owner Sir Tom Farmer, acquired a controlling interest in Hibs. The fans were able to persuade Farmer to take control {{despite the fact that he}} had no great interest in football. Farmer was persuaded in part by the fact that a relative of his had been involved in the rescue of Hibs from financial ruin in the early 1890s. After the attempted takeover by Mercer, Hibs had a few good years in the early 1990s, winning the 1991 Scottish League Cup Final and finishing in the top five in the league in 1993, 1994 and 1995. Soon after Alex McLeish was appointed as manager in 1998, Hibs were relegated to the First Division, but immediately won promotion back to the SPL in 1999.|$|E
5|$|On 23 August 1914, No. 26 was mined {{and sank}} off Pola. No. 22 ran aground and sank off Sebenico on 3 March 1916, but was {{salvaged}} and repaired later that year. All {{of the remaining}} torpedo boats were converted to minesweepers during 1917. They all retained their torpedo tubes, but only Nos. 19 and 21–24 still carried torpedoes. Twenty boats survived the war. Under the Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye, sixteen were allocated to Italy, and she made use of five as customs vessels but scrapped the rest. The customs vessels had also been scrapped by 1925. The remaining four vessels were allocated to the new Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later renamed Yugoslavia). The Yugoslavs retained Nos. 21, 36, 38 and 19 as the minesweepers D1–D4 respectively. D1 and D3–D4 were discarded in 1924, but D2 was retained as a training vessel until 1941. Captured during the World War II Axis invasion of Yugoslavia in April 1941, D2 served in the Royal Italian Navy as D10. She was captured by the German Navy {{at the time of}} the Italian capitulation of September 1943, and was lost in their <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> Kumbor in the Bay of Kotor sometime thereafter.|$|E

40|$|In {{cognitive}} radio (CR), the secondary user (SU) needs to <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> its ongoing communication to an idle channel {{in order to}} avoid interference to the primary user (PU). Spectrum <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> issue becomes challenging in CR mobile ad hoc networks (CR-MANETs) because of the uncertainty in spectrum availability, broad range of spectrum bands and lack of central entity. The {{purpose of this study is}} to design a unified spectrum handoff (USH) scheme for CR-MANETs that considers the spectrum heterogeneity and its availability over time and space. A local flow <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> is performed when spectrum <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> cannot be carried out due to the SUs mobility. To improve further USH, preemptive unified spectrum handoff (PUSH) algorithm is proposed in which two different preemptive <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> threshold regions are defined. The PUSH algorithm also predicts the cognitive link availability considering the PU interference boundary. Although the PUSH scheme improves the <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> performance, the number of spectrum <b>hand</b> <b>offs</b> due to the PU activity should be reduced in this scheme. Therefore, the PC-PUSH (Power Controller-PUSH) scheme is proposed in which the fuzzy logic is used to improve the PUSH in terms of the number of spectrum handoffs because of the PU activity. The PC-PUSH decreases the interference to the PUs, while reducing the number of spectrum handoffs. The results show that the proposed scheme improves the link maintenance probability, decreases the <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> delay, and reduces the number of spectrum handoffs...|$|R

25|$|After {{returning}} to New York City, Eckford quickly {{became involved in}} naval design and construction at his yard there. The market for such ships was depressed after the war, however, so {{he took a job}} with the Navy as chief naval constructor at the Brooklyn Navy Yard in 1817, which he probably viewed as a temporary position until the market improved for privately built ships. While there, he and his apprentice Isaac Webb oversaw construction of the schooner , launched in 1821 and considered one of the fastest schooners of the day until she capsized and sank in a storm with the loss of all <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> Charleston, South Carolina, in 1843.|$|E

40|$|Problem: The <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> at {{the change}} of shift is a {{critical}} time for information exchange which can have significant impact on quality of care and patient safety. The end of shift <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> was identified as an area for improvement on a medical-surgical-acuity adaptable hospital unit. Literature review: Literature suggests that <b>hand</b> <b>offs</b> conducted at the patient’s bedside can help to decrease overtime, improve patient satisfaction scores, and address patient safety/quality issues. Evidence also supports {{the use of a}} standardized format for report. Protocol/Intervention: The first step is to provide better education to patients and families on admission regarding the standard for bedside report. Nurses will ask the patient/family if they wish to be awakened if they are sleeping {{to be included in the}} <b>hand</b> <b>off.</b> If the answer is yes, a card will placed on the patient’s door to alert staff of their wishes to be included in report. The second step is to create a report utilizing the SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) format. This tool would be laminated and affixed to the units work-stations-on-wheels (WOWs). The third step is to reinforce the unit standard of having Patient Care Assistants answer call lights during report time to limit interruptions. Benefits/Barriers: Anticipated benefits to better standardizing <b>hand</b> <b>offs</b> include: improved communication between nurses, improved communication between nursing and patients/families, a more efficient <b>hand</b> <b>off</b> process with less omission of information, and decreased time to conduct the <b>hand</b> <b>offs.</b> Perceived barriers include: potential costs, staff engagement, and compliance. Outcomes: Patient satisfaction, staff satisfaction, unit costs (related to decreased overtime), and patient length of stay will be targeted to improve with this protocol...|$|R

500|$|Although he {{was criticized}} for his autocratic {{coaching}} style and strained relationships, Brown {{played a significant role}} in the evolution and modernization of football. The draw play he invented – a formation in which the quarterback drops back to pass but then <b>hands</b> <b>off</b> the ball to a running back – is still in wide use. In his autobiography, Brown said the play came about by accident in 1946 when Graham botched a play and improvised by making a late handoff to Marion Motley, who ran past the onrushing defenders for a large gain. He developed detailed pass patterns that were designed to exploit vulnerabilities in the defense. [...] Brown is also credited with the creation of the passer's pocket, an offensive line protection scheme that is designed to buy a quarterback a few extra precious seconds to find the open receiver.|$|E
