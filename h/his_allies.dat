5|$|These {{leaders were}} divided {{as to whether}} Edward or Æthelred should succeed Edgar. Neither law nor {{precedent}} offered much guidance. The choice between the sons of Edward the Elder had divided his kingdom, and Edgar's elder brother Eadwig {{had been forced to}} give over {{a large part of the}} kingdom to Edgar. The Queen Dowager certainly supported the claims of her son Æthelred, aided by Bishop Æthelwold; and Dunstan supported Edward, aided by his fellow archbishop Oswald. It is likely that Ealdorman Ælfhere and <b>his</b> <b>allies</b> supported Æthelred and that Æthelwine and <b>his</b> <b>allies</b> supported Edward, although some historians suggest the opposite.|$|E

The war continued until a peace finally emerged in January 1597, but this lasted for only a year and a half. Peace was again reached in late 1599, when Michael was unable to continue the war due to lack of support from <b>his</b> <b>allies.</b>|$|E

5|$|As Hammurabi was {{assisted}} {{during the}} war in the south by <b>his</b> <b>allies</b> from the north such as Yamhad and Mari, the absence of soldiers in the north led to unrest.
