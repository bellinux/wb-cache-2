30|$|Modal age {{at death}} (Mt) is an {{indicator}} of longevity. It represents {{the age at which}} the maximum number of deaths occurs in a population. In a life table, it indicates the age at which most individuals in the initial <b>fictitious</b> <b>cohort</b> die. According to Canudas-Romo (2008), the modal {{age at death}} is largely influenced by the mortality rate at more advanced ages and by infant mortality. Thus, the modal age at death may reflect changes in the probability of death that are not detected by life expectancy.|$|E
40|$|In {{long-term}} follow-up {{studies of}} survival {{after an initial}} event (eg, an operation) mortality from causes {{other than the one}} under study obscures the results, especially in elderly patients. In the traditional approach to the calculation of expected mortality a <b>fictitious</b> <b>cohort</b> is drawn from the general population, being matched for age, sex, and calendar time {{at the time of the}} initial event. The membership of this cohort is then kept constant from the initial event until the closing date of the study. The survival and mortality of this static cohort is then compared with that of the dynamic patient cohort to throw light on mortality from extraneous causes. This method can lead to severe bias if there is a strong correlation between the duration of observation of the patients and their age. The analysis can be improved by applying rate adjustment when calculating the background component of mortality. In this approach mortality rates from the general population are adjusted (weighted) so that the age, sex, and calendar year are at all times identical with those of each of the patients still alive and under observation. This is illustrated by means of a simplified example and a real-life one from a study at survival after aortic valve replacement. Estimation of rate-adjusted background mortality provides a framework that may put long-term survival, especially of elderly patients, in proper perspectiv...|$|E
40|$|Current {{algorithms}} for {{the diagnosis}} of ectopic pregnancy do {{not take into account}} the heterogeneity in patient profiles. Such heterogeneity can lead to differences in the pre-test probability of ectopic pregnancy. In patients with clinical symptoms, for example, the probability of presence of an ectopic pregnancy is higher than in symptom-free patients. Any additional tests should then be interpreted differently, depending on the pre-test probability. We present a diagnostic algorithm that uses probabilistic decision rules for the evaluation of women with suspected ectopic pregnancy with flexible cut-off levels for test positivity We compare it with a general algorithm that uses fixed cut-off levels. <b>Fictitious</b> <b>cohorts,</b> varying in prevalence of ectopic pregnancy were put together, using data obtained from a cohort of > 800 women with suspected ectopic pregnancy. In the inflexible algorithm, ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed whenever it could be visualized at transvaginal sonography, or where serum human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) exceeded a rigid cut-off level; ectopic pregnancy was rejected if an intrauterine pregnancy was seen or when serum HCG decreased. In the flexible algorithm, a post-test probability was obtained after each test, using pre-test probabilities and test-based likelihood ratios. Ectopic pregnancy was diagnosed whenever the post-test probability for ectopic pregnancy exceeded 95 %, whereas this diagnosis was rejected if the calculated post-test probability fell below 1 %. For both algorithms, sensitivity and specificity as well as predictive values were calculated. At each prevalence, the inflexible algorithm was associated with a sensitivity of 93 % and a specificity of 97 %. In contrast, the sensitivity and specificity of the flexible, individualized algorithm depended on the prevalence of ectopic pregnancy. Consequently, predictive values varied strongly when the inflexible algorithm was used, whereas they were much more stable after using the flexible algorithm. For five possible valuations of false positive and false negative diagnoses, the flexible algorithm reduced the expected disutility, compared with the inflexible algorithm. It is concluded that clinicians should incorporate probabilistic decision rules in algorithms used for {{the diagnosis of}} ectopic pregnanc...|$|R
