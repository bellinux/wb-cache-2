Gallaudet, inspired by his success in demonstrating the learning abilities of a young deaf girl Alice Cogswell, traveled to Europe in order to learn deaf pedagogy from European institutions. Ultimately, Gallaudet chose to adopt the methods of the French Institut National de Jeunes Sourds de Paris, and convinced Laurent Clerc, an assistant to the school's founder Charles-Michel de l'Épée, to accompany him back to the United States. Upon his return, Gallaudet founded the ASD on April 15, 1817.|$|E

After returning from Europe, Du Bois completed his graduate studies; in 1895 {{he was the first}} African American to earn a Ph.D. from Harvard University.

5|$|In Japan, {{until the}} Heian period, the {{language}} of government and ritual was Classical Chinese in which was composed decrees, codes, commands, communications and certificates. Consequently, Chinese books were essential <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> of the (male) aristocracy, and beginning readers studied books such as the Mencius or the Thousand Character Classic. Towards {{the end of the}} 7th century, to prepare selected sons of the nobility for a government career, Emperor Tenji established the Daigaku-ryō ("Academy"). At first the curriculum consisted mainly of Confucian Classics and Chinese history. Chinese learning thrived in the 9th century, and the Academy's curriculum saw a rise in literary composition based on the Chinese books Wen Xuan, Records of the Grand Historian and the Books of Han and Later Han. Unlike in China at the time, Classical Confucian studies, especially the historical and political side of Confucianism, were still held in high esteem in the Heian period with commentaries used for study dating to the Han Dynasty. In fact, one of the Japanese emperor's prescribed activities was listening to lectures on the Chinese classics, histories, and poetic anthologies.|$|E

By simple random sampling, 480 accounting students are selected to be surveyed in this study. Descriptive analysis, independent sample t-tests, ANOVA, and multiple regression are used to analyze the data collected. The findings indicate that even though the total average competency scores are at a medium level, the competencies in terms of attitudes, values, and ethics were at a high level. On the other hand, the participating students are at a medium level of readiness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Education</b> Standards. Moreover, there are significant differences between groups of participants based on educational institution, and the students’ awareness of <b>the</b> International <b>Education</b> Standards. Finally, <b>the</b> readiness of the participating Thai accounting students <b>for</b> <b>the</b> International <b>Education</b> Standards is significantly affected by their knowledge, attitudes, and ethical competencies...|$|R
5|$|Jesus College (in full: Jesus College in the University of Oxford of Queen Elizabeth's Foundation) {{is one of}} {{the colleges}} of the University of Oxford in England. It is in the centre of the city, on a site between Turl Street, Ship Street, Cornmarket Street and Market Street. The college was founded by Elizabeth I on 27 June 1571 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> of clergy, though {{students}} now study a broad range of secular subjects. A major driving force behind the establishment of the college was Hugh Price (or Ap Rhys), a churchman from Brecon in Wales. The oldest buildings, in the first quadrangle, date from the 16th and early 17th centuries; a second quadrangle was added between about 1640 and about 1713, and a third quadrangle was built in about 1906. Further accommodation was built on the main site to mark the 400th anniversary of the college, in 1971, and student flats have been constructed at sites in north and east Oxford.|$|E
5|$|Queen's was {{a result}} of an {{outgrowth}} of educational initiatives planned by Presbyterians in the 1830s. A draft plan for the university was presented at a synod meeting in Kingston in 1839, with a modified bill introduced through the 13th Parliament of Upper Canada during a session in 1840. On 16 October 1841, a royal charter was issued through Queen Victoria establishing Queen's College at Kingston. Queen's resulted from years of effort by Presbyterians of Upper Canada to found a college <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>education</b> of ministers in the growing colony and to instruct the youth in various branches of science and literature. They modelled the university after the University of Edinburgh and the University of Glasgow. Classes began on 7 March 1842, in a small wood-frame house {{on the edge of the}} city with two professors and 15 students.|$|E

5|$|The Diocese {{established}} an institute to train female schoolteachers for the Anglican schools in Brighton {{and the rest}} of Sussex in Black Lion Street in The Lanes (the ancient heart of the town) in April 1842.

Ditchling Road, which ran across Ditchling Beacon to Ditchling village and then on to Cuckfield and eventually London, became a turnpike in 1770 and was thereafter one of the main north–south routes into and out of Brighton. The chosen site was on the north side of Viaduct Road, which was built to link Ditchling and London Roads and which formed the northern edge of Brighton's ecclesiastical parish and municipal borough until 1873.|$|E
