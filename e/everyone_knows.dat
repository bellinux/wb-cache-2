25|$|The Secret of the Sword - Duncan MacLeod knows a {{lot about}} swords. <b>Everyone</b> <b>knows</b> that, so he’s called in to help Seacouver police value an antique blade.

25|$|The Work of Mary, that <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> as the Focolare movement, was {{a little}} seed in the Catholic Church’s womb, that {{in the course of}} the years has brought to life a tree which now extends its {{branches}} in all the expressions of the Christian family and also among members of different religions and among many who cultivate justice and solidarity together with the search for truth.|$|E

25|$|Any {{habitual}} pattern {{which is}} interrupted unexpectedly will cause sudden and light trance. The handshake {{is a particularly}} good pattern to interrupt because the formality of a handshake is a widely understood set of social rules. Since <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> {{that it would be}} impolite to comment on the quality of a handshake, regardless of how strange it may be, the subject is obliged to embark on an inner search (known as a transderivational search, a universal and compelling type of trance) to identify the meaning or purpose of the subverted pattern.|$|E
25|$|It {{will be a}} win-at-all costs approach. We're {{going to}} go out and give 110 per cent-over four days of every Shield game. If you give 110 per cent, you'll win a lot more games than you lose. I've been 12 months out of the game but if I see a ball I think I can hit, I will hit it... It's a big part of the {{captaincy}} so <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> where they stand. A happy team turns into a confident team and wins matches. But I have a hell of a lot to learn. It's my first shot at it and I will be listening to a lot of people. People who are willing to give advice and have a bit of a yarn.|$|E

Plans like burrowing a huge underground cave under the Capital {{to hide from the}} Wave, or jumping over it, or diving under it (in the southern ocean) are desperately developed. At this time, Gorbovsky announces that only the children will be transported onto the orbit on Tariel II, but everyone agrees that this is the best choice. Afterwards a crowd of scientists approaches him and asks to take some of their documentation on board, since they consider it too valuable to be sent directly into space with mini-rockets.|$|E
25|$|After being rescued, Mulch gives Artemis {{the disk}} {{that had been}} passed off as a gold medallion, which Butler was given earlier in the book. Artemis views the disk and regains his memories. He is {{overcome}} with guilt {{of what he had}} done to the fairies but to Holly the most and for the first time, he apologizes for kidnapping her. He realises that Holly, Butler, and Mulch were the only friends he had. Together, the four friends take on Opal Koboi, knowing that they are the only ones that know she's escaped. It becomes a more difficult task with the LEP on their tail, who still thinks Holly is the one who killed the Commander. The new Commander refuses to believe anything, despite the fact that <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> Root was like a father to Holly.|$|E

Salma's also got a black shadowy nothingness that Buffy can sense but can barely fight. Meanwhile, in LA, Angel is tied down by a case where his client is wrongfully accused of murder by crooked cops while Cordelia discovers a pack of pre-teens who revere vampires and have been promised eternal life by a vampire.

When Salma suddenly disappears as does Kayley (one of the vampire lovers) <b>everyone</b> <b>knows</b> that something is up. After an explosion of oil fields, caused by Nicky, in Sunnydale, Riley rushes to LA where himself, Buffy and Angel have to work together to solve the disappearances and to calm down the gang warfare going on in LA.|$|E

You always want an underdog guy, somebody to step up when presented with an opportunity." [...] Hector Otero, the Twins scout who signed Valencia and who was the general manager of the Mayagüez club, said: [...] "I think he is a talented player. He definitely can throw.
