40|$|The {{introduction}} of optical transmission technology to communication systems {{during the last}} years {{lead to an increase}} of the data rate from several ten Mbit/s up to the Gbit/s range. Therefore it is of interest to push the frequency range beyond the limits of today's silicon based semiconductor technologies without abandoning this proven material and tool system with its integrated methods. A promising approach is the {{introduction of}} Silicon/Silicon-Germanium <b>Hetero-Bipolar</b> <b>Transistors</b> (Si/SiGe HBTs). It was the goal of this project, to evaluate the enhanced capabilities of Si/SiGe HBTs as compared to {{the state of the art}} Si bipolar technology. To demonstrate the advantages of this new technology for very large bandwidth analog circuits, transimpedance input amplifers targeting for 10 GBit/s data transmission systems were designed and processed. Measurements on these circuits confirm, that SiGe technology is able to yield an enhanced circuit performance. First reliability experiments gave no hints to increased risks in the reliability performance of SiGe HBTs. 1 /f-noise experiments performed on single SiGe transistors showed, that results in noise characteristics can be reached, which are comparable to those of homo-bipolar transistors. This technology can advantageously be used even for ambitious telecom circuits. (orig.)

We {{demonstrate}} how different characterization techniques, X-ray diffractometry and re-flectometry, spectroscopic ellipsometry, Auger electron spectroscopy, secondary ion mass spectros-copy, and transmission electron microscopy, {{can be used}} to analyze the layer properties of typical SiGe <b>Hetero-Bipolar</b> <b>Transistor</b> (HBT) structures. For three different HBTâ€™s the parameters of Si cap and total SiGe layer thickness, maximum Ge content, and shape of the Ge gradient part are measured and the error limits of the different techniques are discussed. We show that the values obtained agree very well within the error limits. Concerning layer thickness an achievable accuracy of about 1 nm is realistic and reproducible in a routine process. The highest accuracy in Ge content determination of about 0. 5 % can be realized by XRD and well-calibrated SE...|$|R
