40|$|Experiments were {{conducted}} to investigate whether it may be feasible to simultaneously mix and retrieve radioactive waste slurries that are stored in million-gallon, double-shell tanks at the Hanford Site in Richland, Washington. Oscillating mixer pumps, located near the floor of these tanks, are used to mobilize and mix the slurry prior to retrieval. Operational scenarios that may be beneficial for retrieval may require simultaneous operation of a decant/transfer pump and the jet mixer pumps. The effects of jet-induced agitation and jet impingement upon the decant/transfer pump's <b>flexible</b> <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> have not previously been experimentally evaluated. Possible effects of the jet impacting the hose include hose fatigue, hose collision or entanglement with other structures, and induced static and dynamic loads on the decant/transfer pump equipment. The objective of this work was to create operating conditions in a test tank that produce a dynamic response (in the <b>flexible</b> <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> upon impingement from an above-floor jet) {{that is similar to}} that anticipated in the actual tank. A scaling analysis was conducted to define the interactions between the jet, the tank floor and the suction hose. The complexity of scaling the multi-layer flexible hose (matching its hydroelastic parameters at full and 1 / 4 -scale) led to an alternate approach, that of matching the expected full-scale forces on the full-scale hose in the scaled tank. Two types of tests {{were conducted}}: characterization of the jet velocity profile in the test tank at two axial locations from the nozzle and observation of the motion induced in the flexible retrieval hose from impact by the jet. The velocity profile of the jet in the test tank was measured to compare the measured profiles with profile predictions for an above-floor jet. These data were used to obtain a refined estimate of the velocity profile and therefore, the force acting upon the test article at a particular location in the tank. The hose motion and location within the test tank resulting from jet impingement were recorded by video. This visual record can be correlated with the data recorded by the data acquisition system. These data coupled with the velocity profile results, were used to estimate the forces required to induce motion in the hose...|$|E

500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> sections, pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R

In the United States, NFPA 1901 requires engines to have hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> that matches the engine's pump rating. [...] For example, an engine with a 1000 gal per minute pump is required to carry 5 in or larger hose, while a wildland fire engine will typically carry 2 to 2.5 in hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> {{can also}} be used to extend the range of a water tender's dumping capability, if the {{fittings}} of the hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> match those of the tender dumping water. This could be used to fill a portable dump tank not immediately adjacent to the water tender, from which another fire engine can draft. Since water movement during dumping relies on gravity, rather than mechanical pressurization, hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> is useful for this task.|$|R
50|$|Another <b>suction</b> <b>hose,</b> {{called a}} soft suction, is {{actually}} a short length of fabric-covered, flexible discharge hose used to connect the fire pumper suction inlet with a pressurized hydrant. It is not a true <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> as it cannot withstand a negative pressure.|$|R
500|$|Hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> {{may also}} be used to connect a fire engine to a hydrant. [...] This {{practice}} is common in Australia, but woven jacket fire hose is normally used for this purpose in the United States. [...] Using hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> in this manner requires that the fire engine be positioned carefully for the limited flexibility of the hose, and may require multiple firefighters due to the weight and bulk of the hose section. In certain circumstances, {{it may be possible to}} use hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> to draft from a hydrant with adequate water supply but a low flow rate.|$|R

50|$|To reduce {{drafting}} {{friction and}} obtain a larger flow or higher lift, a larger cross-section of <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> is employed. For example, using a five-inch (127 mm) hose, a pump that could lift 500 US gallons per minute (30 L/s) up 23 feet (7 m) {{would only be}} able to lift the same amount of water 12.5 feet (4 m) through a 3.5-inch (76 mm) hose. Fire engines are often seen carrying two or three 10-foot (3 m) lengths of <b>suction</b> <b>hose,</b> but the longer the lift, the lower the flow, for a fixed-diameter <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> and a given pump. Multiple relays could be used if the need arises, with a suction pump drafting up to 10 metres (30 ft) and discharging at great distances.|$|R

500|$|Hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose</b> (alternatively, <b>suction</b> <b>hose)</b> is a {{specific}} type of fire hose used in drafting operations, when a fire engine uses a vacuum to draw water from a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source. [...] It is built to withstand vacuum, rather than pressure, abrasion, and heat. [...] In the United States, it is standard equipment according to the National Fire Protection Association standards for fire engines.

500|$|Hard <b>suction</b> <b>hose,</b> {{also known}} as a <b>suction</b> <b>hose,</b> is a {{specific}} type of rigid fire hose used in drafting operations. When using this technique, the fire engine draws water for fire fighting from an unpressurized supply, such as a portable water tank, pool, or other static water source, instead of drawing water from a pressurized water supply, such as a fire hydrant.
