5|$|The $50 pieces {{stood as}} the highest {{denomination}} U.S. coins for many years. In 1986, the Mint began producing the American Gold Eagle, also with <b>face</b> <b>value</b> $50. The record was surpassed with the American Platinum Eagle with a <b>face</b> <b>value</b> of $100, in 1997.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{previous}} studies on <b>face</b> <b>values</b> across {{a number of}} disciplines, there is limited research on how <b>face</b> <b>values</b> influence manager-subordinate relationships in China&# 039;s civil service. This study examines the role of managers&# 039; <b>face</b> <b>values</b> {{in the relationship between}} their trust in subordinate loyalty and willingness to empower subordinates. The findings of our study indicate that superior face-saving and face-enhancing values moderate the relationships between information sharing, initiative encouragement, and their trust in subordinate loyalty...|$|R

5|$|It is {{the policy}} of the Bank of England to redeem all {{withdrawn}} notes for current currency at the <b>face</b> <b>value</b> shown on the note, except for counterfeit currency. Examples of counterfeits from Operation Bernhard have appeared at auction and been sold through dealers for a higher <b>face</b> <b>value</b> than the original £5. There are also examples of the notes in the museum of the National Bank of Belgium and the Bank of England Museum.|$|E
5|$|Previous {{security}} {{features in the}} Ship Series were carried over to the Portrait Series, and new ones incorporated into the banknote. The two most prominent {{security features}} are the engraved portrait of Yusof bin Ishak (which contains fine lines that are difficult for counterfeiters to mimic) and the Kinegram (a printed security hologram); MAS states that banknotes with missing or mutilated portrait or/and Kinegram command no value. Paper versions issued by BCCS features its logo and the <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> while those issued by the MAS features its logo with the Merlion (a mythical creature and national symbol) and the <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> Polymer versions of the banknote have the Kinegram replaced by {{an image of the}} Singapore lion symbol with the <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> showing the coat of arms of Singapore when tilted at varying degrees.|$|E

5|$|Hyperinflationary Zimbabwean {{banknotes}} (such as the $100 trillion denomination) {{have gained}} considerable interest from the numismatic community and buyers in general for its absurdity {{rather than the}} design.

5|$|Model's true {{opinion on}} the value of the {{offensive}} remains unclear. Manstein took his recommendation at <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> while Guderian said that he was categorically against attacking. It has similarly been suggested that Model, in fact, hoped to scuttle the operation by causing it to be delayed until the Soviet forces launched their own attack.|$|E
5|$|The last {{portion of}} the report dealt with {{eliminating}} the debt by utilizing a sinking fund that would retire {{five percent of the}} debt annually until it was paid off.

5|$|As few Susan B. Anthony dollars circulated, many remain {{available}} in uncirculated condition and are worth little above <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> However, some date and mint mark varieties are relatively valuable. The 1981 coins, having been issued only to collectors, are valued above the other circulation strikes in the series. In addition, a well-known {{variety of the}} 1979 circulation strikes on which the date appears nearer to the rim commands a higher price than the regular issue.|$|E

Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying <b>face</b> <b>value</b> for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the secondary market, often {{for as little as}} 99 cents.|$|E

5|$|Gore's {{windfall}} was realized when in 1790 the United States Congress, {{acting on}} a proposal made by Alexander Hamilton and supported by Gore's friend Rufus King, passed legislation that exchanged Continental and state paper for new U.S. paper at <b>face</b> <b>value.</b> Not only did Gore win on this exchange, but the paper he received appreciated in value before he sold it. The exact amount he made is unclear from the surviving documents: John Quincy Adams wrote that Gore's speculations made him the wealthiest lawyer in the country.|$|E
50|$|The {{country of}} Poland {{has a very}} recent example of demonetization {{involving}} the stamp issues of 1990 to 1994. During this period of time, the <b>face</b> <b>values</b> of stamps due to hyperinflation gradually changed the <b>face</b> <b>values</b> to thousands of zloty. Commemorative stamp issues from 1995 to 1997 are also demonetized now as are certain selected issues as announced by the Polish Post Office.|$|R
5000|$|The {{plan was}} to have thirty coins, twenty-eight silver coins with <b>face</b> <b>values</b> of $5 and $10, and two gold coins.

Four more stamps with higher <b>face</b> <b>values</b> from 100 reis to 300 reis were issed in the following year, {{as well as a}} 5 reis stamp. In 1896 the 100 reis stamp was officially bisected in order to frank newspaper wrappers and letters.|$|R
5|$|In 1920, {{commemorative}} coins {{were not}} {{sold by the}} government—Congress, in authorizing legislation, usually designated an organization which had the exclusive right to purchase them at <b>face</b> <b>value</b> and vend them {{to the public at}} a premium. Although not mentioned in the legislation, {{in the case of the}} Alabama Centennial half dollar, the centennial commission was the authorized group.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} the Treasury vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at <b>face</b> <b>value,</b> and eventually the Treasury ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, the Treasury conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E
5|$|Islamic philosopher Carl Ernst {{has argued}} that {{religious}} language is often political, especially in the public sphere, and that its purpose is to persuade people and establish authority, as well as convey information. He explains that the modern criticisms of the West made by some sections of Islam are an ideological reaction to colonialism, which intentionally uses the same language as colonialists. Ernst argues that when it is used rhetorically, religious language cannot be taken at <b>face</b> <b>value</b> because of its political implications.|$|E
