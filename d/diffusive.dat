5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} patterns of gas exchange demonstrated by different groups of insects. Gas exchange patterns in insects can range from continuous and <b>diffusive</b> ventilation, to discontinuous gas exchange. During continuous gas exchange, oxygen is taken in and carbon dioxide is released in a continuous cycle. In discontinuous gas exchange, however, the insect takes in oxygen while it is active and small amounts of carbon dioxide are released when the insect is at rest. <b>Diffusive</b> ventilation is simply a form of continuous gas exchange that occurs by diffusion rather than physically taking in the oxygen. Some species of insect that are submerged also have adaptations to aid in respiration. As larvae, many insects have gills that can extract oxygen dissolved in water, while others need {{to rise to the}} water surface to replenish air supplies, which may be held or trapped in special structures.|$|E
25|$|In this circumstance, {{it may be}} {{expected}} that {{there may also be}} active other drivers of <b>diffusive</b> flux of internal energy, such as gradient of chemical potential which drives transfer of matter, and gradient of electric potential which drives electric current and iontophoresis; such effects usually interact with <b>diffusive</b> flux of internal energy driven by temperature gradient, and such interactions are known as cross-effects.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{equation}} governs heat diffusion, {{as well as}} other <b>diffusive</b> processes, such as particle diffusion or the propagation of action potential in nerve cells. Although they are not <b>diffusive</b> in nature, some quantum mechanics problems are also governed by a mathematical analog of the {{heat equation}} (see below). It also can be used to model some phenomena arising in finance, like the Black–Scholes or the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes. The equation, and various non-linear analogues, has also been used in image analysis.|$|E

25|$|If cross-effects {{that result}} in <b>diffusive</b> {{transfer}} of internal energy were also labeled as heat transfers, they would sometimes violate the rule that pure heat transfer occurs only down a temperature gradient, never up one. They would also contradict the principle that all heat transfer is of {{one and the same}} kind, a principle founded on the idea of heat conduction between closed systems. One might to try to think narrowly of heat flux driven purely by temperature gradient as a conceptual component of <b>diffusive</b> internal energy flux, in the thermodynamic view, the concept resting specifically on careful calculations based on detailed knowledge of the processes and being indirectly assessed. In these circumstances, if perchance it happens that no transfer of matter is actualized, and there are no cross-effects, then the thermodynamic concept and the mechanical concept coincide, as if one were dealing with closed systems. But when there is transfer of matter, the exact laws by which temperature gradient drives <b>diffusive</b> flux of internal energy, rather than being exactly knowable, mostly need to be assumed, and in many cases are practically unverifiable. Consequently, when there is transfer of matter, the calculation of the pure 'heat flux' component of the <b>diffusive</b> flux of internal energy rests on practically unverifiable assumptions. This is a reason to think of heat as a specialized concept that relates primarily and precisely to closed systems, and applicable only in a very restricted way to open systems.|$|E
25|$|Some {{models of}} the ocean {{circulation}} suggest that broad-scale upwelling occurs in the tropics, as pressure driven flows converge water toward the low latitudes where it is diffusively warmed from above. The required diffusion coefficients, however, appear to be larger than are observed in the real ocean. Nonetheless, some <b>diffusive</b> upwelling does probably occur.|$|E

25|$|Photoacoustic imaging is a {{recently}} developed hybrid biomedical imaging modality {{based on the}} photoacoustic effect. It combines the advantages of optical absorption contrast with ultrasonic spatial resolution for deep imaging in (optical) <b>diffusive</b> or quasi-diffusive regime.

25|$|Most {{species of}} aphids, at {{all stages of}} development, move about {{over the surface of}} their host plants and even between {{adjacent}} plants. These local movements result in slow <b>diffusive</b> dispersal. In contrast, aphids also show persistent 'straightened out' movements during which their vegetative responses are depressed; these movements are a means of transport over larger distances. Local 'trivial' movements and distant 'migratory' movements can be recognized, and it is possible that they are the extremes of a continuum of movement that disperses all species of aphids.|$|E
25|$|For {{the first}} law of thermodynamics, {{there is no}} trivial passage of {{physical}} conception from the closed system view to an open system view. For closed systems, the concepts of an adiabatic enclosure and of an adiabatic wall are fundamental. Matter and internal energy cannot permeate or penetrate such a wall. For an open system, there is a wall that allows penetration by matter. In general, matter in <b>diffusive</b> motion carries with it some internal energy, and some microscopic potential energy changes accompany the motion. An open system is not adiabatically enclosed.|$|E
25|$|Caesium {{chloride}} {{is widely}} used in centrifugation in a technique known as isopycnic centrifugation. Centripetal and <b>diffusive</b> forces establish a density gradient that allow separation of mixtures {{on the basis of}} their molecular density. This technique allows separation of DNA of different densities (e.g. DNA fragments with differing A-T or G-C content). This application requires a solution with high density and yet relatively low viscosity, and CsCl suits it because of its high solubility in water, high density owing to the large mass of Cs, as well as low viscosity and high stability of CsCl solutions.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, for the thermodynamical {{description}} of non-equilibrium processes, it is desired {{to consider the}} effect of a temperature gradient established by the surroundings across the system of interest when there is no physical barrier or wall between system and surroundings, that is to say, when they are open with respect to one another. The impossibility of a mechanical definition in terms of work for this circumstance does not alter the physical fact that a temperature gradient causes a <b>diffusive</b> flux of internal energy, a process that, in the thermodynamic view, might be proposed as a candidate concept for transfer of energy as heat.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to having a <b>diffusive</b> effect on ion transport, water molecules also form hydration shells around individual ions due to their polar nature. The hydration shell not only shields the charge on ions from other ions but also modulates the ion radial distribution function causing the formation of peaks and troughs. The average minimum distance between two ions is increased as there is always at least one layer of water molecules present between them, acting as a physical deterrent preventing two ions from getting too close to each other, {{in a manner that}} is similar to the short-range repulsive component of the Lennard-Jones potential.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of a flowing system of only one {{chemical}} constituent, in the Lagrangian representation, there is no distinction between bulk flow and diffusion of matter. Moreover, the flow of matter is zero into or out of the cell that moves with the local center of mass. In effect, in this description, one is dealing with a system effectively closed to the transfer of matter. But still one can validly talk of a distinction between bulk flow and <b>diffusive</b> flow of internal energy, the latter driven by a temperature gradient within the flowing material, and being defined with respect to the local center of mass of the bulk flow. In this case of a virtually closed system, because of the zero matter transfer, as noted above, one can safely distinguish between transfer of energy as work, and transfer of internal energy as heat.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of human Kinesin-5 inhibitors are selective, because they bind to a drug ‘hot spot’, composed of residues from the α2 and α3 helices and a flexible L5 loop {{on the surface}} of the motor domain. [...] This L5 loop has high sequence variability amongst the Kinesin-5 orthologs and other kinesins within the superfamily. [...] The L5 loop in human Kinesin-5 closes around the inhibitor and is open in the absence of inhibitor. [...] These structural changes are correlated with other changes in the catalytic active site. Other sites of inhibitor binding have been identified in the human Kinesin-5 motor domain. For inhibitors that bind to the L5 pocket, the mechanism of inhibition is that they slow ADP release from the catalytic active site and inhibit ATP-dependent directional motion. [...] However, a previously unknown <b>diffusive</b> motion by Kinesin-5 along microtubules was uncovered when monastrol inhibited the motor domain.|$|E

2500|$|The above {{properties}} (positive definiteness of energy) {{allow the}} analytic {{continuation of the}} Schrödinger equation {{to be identified as}} a stochastic process. This can be interpreted as the Huygens–Fresnel principle applied to De Broglie waves; the spreading wavefronts are <b>diffusive</b> probability amplitudes.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{systems with}} {{chemical}} relaxation also show measurable diffusion as well, and the autocorrelation function {{will depend on}} the details of the system. [...] If the diffusion and chemical reaction are decoupled, the combined autocorrelation is the product of the chemical and <b>diffusive</b> autocorrelations.|$|E
2500|$|Reactive flows {{can involve}} gases, liquids, and solids, or {{combinations}} thereof. [...] As these move through space and over time, they may change chemically. Reactive flow problems often involve multiple processes interacting simultaneously. [...] Identifying the boundary conditions where states of matter react, {{and the ways}} in which they interact, is important in modelling reactive flows. Physical processes involved in reactive flows include species reactions, <b>diffusive</b> transport, radiative transport, convection, and wave-like properties, some or all of which may be modeled to address a particular problem. [...] Modelling of complex reactive flows has applications in a wide variety of areas including aerodynamics, [...] hydrodynamics, [...] microfluidics, [...] chemical kinetics, [...] chemical process modeling (involving advective and <b>diffusive</b> transport processes as well as chemical kinetics) and combustion-related flame and detonation phenomena.|$|E
2500|$|In many {{writings}} in this context, {{the term}} [...] "heat flux" [...] is used when {{what is meant}} is therefore more accurately called <b>diffusive</b> flux of internal energy; such usage of the term [...] "heat flux" [...] is a residue of older and now obsolete language usage that allowed that a body may have a [...] "heat content".|$|E
2500|$|The {{expression}} is valid if {{the average number}} [...] of fluorophores in the focal volume is low and if dark states, etc., of the fluorophore can be ignored.

2500|$|The famous text [...] "The {{chemical}} {{basis of}} morphogenesis," [...] written in 1952 by mathematician and computer scientist Alan Turing advocated for various biological models based on molecular diffusion of nutrients. However, a <b>diffusive</b> model of vascular development {{would seem to}} fall short {{of the complexity of}} capillary beds and the interwoven network of arteries and veins. In 2000, Fleury proposed that instead of <b>diffusive</b> molecules bearing responsibility for the branching morphogenesis of the vascular tree, a long-range morphogen may be implicated. In this model, a traveling pressure wave would act upon the vasculature via shear stress to rearrange branches into the lowest-energy configuration by widening vessels carrying increased blood flow and rearranging networks upon the initiation of fluid flow. It is known that mechanical forces can have a dramatic impact on the morphology and complexity of the vascular tree. However, 난these forces have comparably little impact on the diffusion of nutrients, and it therefore seems unlikely that acquisition of nutrients and oxygen plays a significant role in embryonic vascular remodelling.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a reduced}} {{particle}} approach, BioMOCA replaces the explicit water molecules with continuum background and handles the ion-water interactions using BTMC method, in which, appropriate scattering rates should be chosen. In other words, ion trajectories are randomly interrupted by scattering events {{that account for}} the ions’ <b>diffusive</b> motion in water. In between these scattering events, ions follow the Newtonian forces. The free flight times, Tf, are generated statistically from the total scattering rate according to ...|$|E
2500|$|The grading of {{composition}} in the base, for example, by progressively {{increasing the amount}} of germanium in a SiGe transistor, causes a gradient in bandgap in the neutral base, denoted in the figure by ΔφG, providing a [...] "built-in" [...] field that assists electron transport across the base. That drift component of transport aids the normal <b>diffusive</b> transport, increasing the frequency response of the transistor by shortening the transit time across the base.|$|E
2500|$|The {{situation}} is clarified by Gyarmati, who shows that {{his definition of}} [...] "heat transfer", for continuous-flow systems, really refers not specifically to heat, but rather to transfer of internal energy, as follows. He considers a conceptual small cell {{in a situation of}} continuous-flow as a system defined in the so-called Lagrangian way, moving with the local center of mass. The flow of matter across the boundary is zero when considered as a flow of total mass. Nevertheless, if the material constitution is of several chemically distinct components that can diffuse with respect to one another, the system is considered to be open, the <b>diffusive</b> flows of the components being defined with respect to the center of mass of the system, and balancing one another as to mass transfer. Still there can be a distinction between bulk flow of internal energy and <b>diffusive</b> flow of internal energy in this case, because the internal energy density {{does not have to be}} constant per unit mass of material, and allowing for non-conservation of internal energy because of local conversion of kinetic energy of bulk flow to internal energy by viscosity.|$|E
2500|$|Within this context, Meuffels and Soni {{pointed to}} a {{fundamental}} thermodynamic [...] principle: [...] Non-volatile information storage requires the existence of free energy barriers that separate the distinct internal memory states of a system from each other; otherwise, one would be faced with an [...] "indifferent" [...] situation and the system would arbitrarily fluctuate from one memory state to another just {{under the influence of}} thermal fluctuations. When unprotected against thermal fluctuations, the internal memory states exhibit some <b>diffusive</b> dynamics which causes state degradation. [...] The free energy barriers must therefore be high enough to ensure a low bit-error probability of bit operation. [...] Consequently, there is always a lower limit of energy requirement – depending on the required bit-error probability – for intentionally changing a bit value in any memory device.|$|E
2500|$|Fur is dense hair. Primarily, [...] fur augments the {{insulation}} the skin provides {{but can also}} serve as a secondary sexual characteristic or as camouflage. On some animals, the skin is very hard and thick, and can be processed to create leather. Reptiles and fish have hard protective scales on their skin for protection, and birds have hard feathers, all made of tough β-keratins. Amphibian skin is not a strong barrier, especially regarding the passage of chemicals via skin and is often subject to osmosis and <b>diffusive</b> forces. For example, a frog sitting in an anesthetic solution would be sedated quickly, as the chemical diffuses through its skin. [...] Amphibian skin plays key roles in everyday survival and their ability to exploit a wide range of habitats and ecological conditions.|$|E
