500|$|Masashi Hamauzu, the {{composer}} for Chocobo's Mysterious Dungeon, was not {{expecting to be}} assigned the soundtrack to the game. [...] In the liner notes for the original soundtrack album, he states that he was [...] "still in high school when that lovable character first made his debut in Final Fantasy", but that the [...] "Chocobo Theme" [...] made a big impression on him, leading him to often think to himself that he would [...] "love to try <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> work". The soundtrack was the first solo album that Hamauzu had produced. When he wrote his own Chocobo themes for the Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Original Soundtrack, he decided to arrange the opening and ending of the album for a fifty-piece orchestra, which lead {{to the creation of}} the orchestrated Chocobo no Fushigina Dungeon Coi Vanni Gialli album. [...] In the liner notes for that album, he explains that his motivation for creating the orchestral works was because [...] "Demand for classical music in Japan is still low compared with other countries" [...] and he wanted [...] "to spread the word on this style of music by any means necessary". He ends the note by exhorting his listeners to [...] "take your time" [...] with classical music such as the album, so that one day they will appreciate it.|$|E

2500|$|Bobby Gillespie of Primal Scream was {{inspired}} by both [...] "Happy House" [...] and [...] "Christine" [...] because they were pop songs with dark subject matter. He stated: [...] "That's the idea, yeah—to use the conventional way of constructing a pop song to communicate what I feel about the world and my take on relationships. It's a twist that makes it darker than it seems. When we were growing up, Siouxsie and the Banshees were <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff—they were getting in the charts with songs about mental hospitals! [...] "Happy House"? That was nearly number fucking 10 in the charts! 'Christine, the strawberry girl, Christine, banana split lady'—they were writing about a girl with schizophrenia! They were getting in pop magazines and on TV; they were getting played on daytime radio. It's fucking subversive! They were outsiders bringing outsider subjects to the mainstream".|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-1980s, Natalie Cole {{recorded}} [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] at {{the suggestion}} of producer Dennis Lambert; Cole recalls: [...] "I thought to myself, 'I'm too old to be <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> stuff', but then I'd never worked with anyone quite like Dennis before. He was very passionate about his work [...] his enthusiasm gave me the confidence that I could pull [...] off." [...] The track was intended for an album release on the Modern label; that project was canceled and Cole's [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] and another Lambert production: [...] "I Live For Your Love", were picked up by EMI-Manhattan Records to appear on Cole's 1987 album Everlasting. [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] was released as that album's third single in March 1988, returning Cole to the Top Ten {{for the first time since}} 1978 in April 1988 to ascend to a #5 peak - matching Cole's previous Pop chart best with [...] "I've Got Love on My Mind" [...] - that May. Cole's [...] "Pink Cadillac" [...] also reached #9 R, #16 A/C and - via a remix by David Cole (no relation) and Robert Clivilles - #1 on Billboard Hot Dance Club Play chart. According to Cole, [...] "word got back" [...] to her that Bruce Springsteen [...] "thought it was very cool that a woman could [...] and it would come out so great". (Springsteen had vetoed a 1983 release of Bette Midler's version of the song as gender-inappropriate, as detailed below.) ...|$|E
