25|$|The China seas contain about 3,000 marine species, {{of which}} more than 150 species are fished commercially. Some major marine fishing species in recent times are <b>hairtail,</b> chub mackerel, black scraper, anchovy and some species of shrimps, crabs and smaller fishes.|$|E
25|$|Both {{fresh and}} {{saltwater}} fish are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews. Common grilled fish include mackerel, <b>hairtail,</b> croaker and Pacific herring. Smaller fish, shrimp, squid, mollusks {{and countless other}} seafood can be salted and fermented as jeotgal. Fish can also be grilled either whole or in fillets as banchan. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping over long distances. Fish commonly dried include yellow corvina, anchovies (myeolchi) and croaker. Dried anchovies, along with kelp, {{form the basis of}} common soup stocks.|$|E
25|$|Commonly used {{seasonings}} include gochugaru (chili powder), scallions, garlics, ginger, and jeotgal (salted seafood) Jeotgal can {{be replaced}} with raw seafood in colder Northern parts of the Korean peninsula. If used, milder saeu-jeot (salted shrimp) or jogi-jeot (salted croaker) is preferred {{and the amount of}} jeotgal is also reduced in Northern and Central regions. In Southern Korea, on the other hand, generous amount of stronger myeolchi-jeot (salted anchovies) and galchi-jeot (salted <b>hairtail)</b> is commonly used. Raw seafood or daegu-agami-jeot (salted cod gills) are used in the East coast areas.|$|E
50|$|Anthene is a {{butterfly}} genus {{in the family}} Lycaenidae, commonly called the ciliate blues or <b>hairtails.</b>|$|R
50|$|Largehead <b>hairtails</b> {{can grow}} to 2.34 m in length, {{although}} most only are 1 m. The largest recorded weight is 5 kg {{and the oldest}} recorded age is 15 years. They prefer coastal regions and sometimes enter estuaries. They are found at depths of 0 to 589 m with most records between 100 and 350 m.|$|R
50|$|Although {{the various}} {{species of the}} genus Acetes are not always {{distinguished}} by fishermen, collectively they form the world's largest shrimp fishery. There are fisheries for Acetes in Korea, Japan and Southeast Asia, {{but the vast majority}} of the catch is in China. The total catch is likely to be grossly under-recorded, but was estimated at 664,716 t in 2005. Within the Asia-Pacific region, the Acetes fishery is the fourth largest fishery by weight, after <b>hairtails,</b> anchovies and scads.|$|R

5|$|The known diet of the {{dusky shark}} {{encompasses}} pelagic fishes, including herring and anchovies, tuna and mackerel, billfish, jacks, needlefish and flyingfish, threadfins, <b>hairtails,</b> lancetfish, and lanternfish; demersal fishes, including mullets, porgies, grunts, and flatheads, eels, lizardfish, cusk eels, gurnards, and flatfish; reef fishes, including barracudas, goatfish, spadefish, groupers, scorpionfish, and porcupinefish; cartilaginous fishes, including dogfish, sawsharks, angel sharks, catsharks, thresher sharks, smoothhounds, smaller requiem sharks, sawfish, guitarfish, skates, stingrays, and butterfly rays; and invertebrates, including cephalopods, decapod crustaceans, barnacles, and sea stars. Very rarely, the largest dusky sharks may also consume sea turtles, marine mammals (mainly as carrion), and human refuse.|$|R
40|$|Recently, the {{increasing}} population of giant jellyfish Nemopilema nomurai has negatively affected coastal fisheries in Korea. As a result, {{the fishing industry}} has begun developing devices to prevent jellyfish capture. In this study, we assessed {{the performance of a}} conical jellyfish exclusion device in the coastal areas of Yokji Island in southern Korea during 2009. After hauling, we measured the length, diameter, and weight of the jellyfish and fish that were captured by the cod end and cover net. We found that the captured species included N. nomurai, silver croakers Pennahia argentata, yellow croakers Larimichthys polyactics, shotted halibut Eopsetta grigorjewi, largehead <b>hairtails</b> Trichiurus lepturus, and melon seeds Psenopsis anomala. The catch ratios of the giant jellyfish that entered the cod end in terms of weight ranged from 0. 005 to 0. 027. In contrast, the catch ratios of total fish in terms of weight and number were 0. 793 and 0. 835, respectively. On selectivity analysis of a conical separator for individual fish species, their exclusion ratios were independent of their length, and were similar to their observed exclusion ratios in terms of number. These results indicated that the conical jellyfish exclusion device performs well; however, some improvements are needed to minimize the escape of fish from the net...|$|R
40|$|Diurnal {{variation}} in trawl catches {{and its influence}} on energy efficiency of trawler operations are discussed in this paper, based on data on landings of a Japanese factory trawler which operated in the Indian waters during 1992 - 93. The factory vessel equipped for stern trawling had a length overall of 110 m, GT of 5460 and installed engine power of 5700 hp. Operations were conducted off west coast of India between 31 and 278 m depth contours, using a 80. 4 m high opening bottom trawl with an adjusted vertical opening of 7. 6  0. 9 m. The catch data was grouped according to the median towing hour, {{by the time of}} the day. CPUE obtained was 3713. 4 kg. h- 1 for day time operations and 1536. 6 kg. h- 1 for night-time operations. Mean daily catches were 31367 kg. day- 1 (SE: 2743) for day time operations and 9430 kg. day- 1 (SE: 966) for night-time operations. Fuel consumption were 0. 399 and 0. 982 kg fuel. kg fish- 1, respectively for day and night-time operations. Total catch and catch components such as threadfin bream, bulls eye, <b>hairtails,</b> trevelly, lizard fish showed significant improvement during day-time operations while swarming crabs showed a significant improvement in the night-time operations. The difference in catch rates between day and night could be attributed to diurnal {{variation in}} the spatial distribution and schooling behaviour of the catch categories, their differential behaviour in the vicinity of trawl systems under varying light levels of day and night and consequent effect on catching efficiency and size selectivity at different stages in the capture process. The results obtained in addition to its importance in the operational planning of trawling in order to realise objectives of maximising catch per unit effort and minimising fuel consumption per unit volume of fish caught, has added significance in the use of bottom trawl surveys in stock abundance estimates...|$|R
