40|$|A {{methodology}} {{to measure}} Near Infrared (NIR) scintillations in gaseous and liquid Ar, using Geiger-mode APDs (GAPDs) sensitive in the NIR and pulsed X-ray irradiation, is described. This {{study has been}} triggered {{by the development of}} Cryogenic Avalanche Detectors (CRADs) with optical readout in the NIR using combined THGEM/GAPD multiplier, which may come to be in demand in coherent neutrino-nucleus scattering and dark matter search experiments. A new approach to measure the NIR scintillation yield at cryogenic temperatures has been developed, namely using GAPDs in single photoelectron counting mode with time resolution. The time structure of NIR scintillations and their light yield were measured both for primary scintillations and that of secondary at moderate electric <b>fields</b> (<b>electroluminescence),</b> in gaseous and liquid Ar.

40|$|Semiconducting quantum dots, whose {{particle}} {{sizes are}} in the nanometer range, have very unusual properties. The quantum dots have band gaps that depend in a complicated fashion upon a number of factors, described in the article. Processing-structure-properties-performance relationships are reviewed for compound semiconducting quantum dots. Various methods for synthesizing these quantum dots are discussed, {{as well as their}} resulting properties. Quantum states and confinement of their excitons may shift their optical absorption and emission energies. Such effects are important for tuning their luminescence stimulated by photons (photoluminescence) or electric <b>field</b> (<b>electroluminescence).</b> In this article, decoupling of quantum effects on excitation and emission are described, along with the use of quantum dots as sensitizers in phosphors. In addition, we reviewed the multimodal applications of quantum dots, including in electroluminescence device, solar cell and biological imaging...|$|R
40|$|The layered {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) have attracted considerable interest {{due to their}} unique electronic and optical properties. Here we report electric <b>field</b> induced strong <b>electroluminescence</b> in multi-layer MoS 2 and WSe 2. We show that GaN-Al 2 O 3 -MoS 2 and GaN-Al 2 O 3 -MoS 2 -Al 2 O 3 -graphene vertical heterojunctions can be created with excellent rectification behaviour. Electroluminescence studies demonstrate prominent direct bandgap excitonic emission in multi-layer MoS 2 over the entire vertical junction area. Importantly, the electroluminescence efficiency observed in multi-layer MoS 2 is comparable to or even higher than that in monolayers, corresponding to a relative electroluminescence enhancement factor of > 1000 in multi-layer MoS 2 when compared to its photoluminescence. This striking enhancement of electroluminescence {{can be attributed to}} the <b>high</b> electric <b>field</b> induced carrier redistribution from low energy points (indirect bandgap) to high energy points (direct bandgap) of k-space, arising from the unique band structure of MoS 2 with a much higher density of states at high energy points. The electric <b>field</b> induced <b>electroluminescence</b> is general for other TMDs including WSe 2, and can provide a fundamental platform to probe the carrier injection, population and recombination in multi-layer TMDs and open up a new pathway toward TMD based optoelectronic devices.

50|$|SWI {{is uniquely}} suited to take {{advantage}} of <b>higher</b> <b>field</b> systems, as the contrast in the phase image is linearly proportional to echo time (TE) and <b>field</b> strength. <b>Higher</b> <b>fields</b> thus allow shorter echo times without a loss of contrast which can reduce scan time and motion related artifacts.

Due to the <b>high</b> accelerating <b>fields</b> in these structures (1 – 3 MV/cm), a complete description of transport under <b>high</b> <b>field</b> conditions utilizing information on the full band structure of the material is critical to understand the light emission process due to impact excitation of luminescent impurities.

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>field</b> MRI {{operating}} at 3 T is increasingly {{being used in}} the field of neuroradiology on the grounds that <b>higher</b> magnetic <b>field</b> strength should theoretically lead to a higher diagnostic accuracy in the diagnosis of several disease entities. This Editorial discusses the exhaustive review by Wardlaw and colleagues of research comparing 3 T MRI with 1. 5 T MRI in the field of neuroradiology. Interestingly, the authors found no convincing evidence of improved image quality, diagnostic accuracy, or reduced total examination times using 3 T MRI instead of 1. 5 T MRI. These findings are highly relevant since a new generation of <b>high</b> <b>field</b> MRI systems {{operating at}} 7 T has recently been introduced. Key Points • <b>Higher</b> magnetic <b>field</b> strengths do not necessarily lead to a better diagnostic accuracy. • Disadvantages of <b>high</b> <b>field</b> MR systems have to be considered in clinical practice. • <b>Higher</b> <b>field</b> strengths are needed for functional imaging, spectroscopy, etc. • Disappointingly there are few direct comparisons of 1. 5 and 3 T MRI. • Whether the next <b>high</b> <b>field</b> MR generation (7 T) will improve diagnostic accuracy has to be investigated. © European Society of Radiology 2012...|$|R
40|$|The rf {{sputtered}} copper ferrite films contain nanocrystalline grains.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to {{describe}} superconducting magnet coil arrangements from low to <b>high</b> <b>field,</b> particularly from 1 T to 7 T, within the context of the minimum stored energy designs. The findings illustrate that at low field, the maximum peak magnetic fields are located away from the most inner coils of the magnet configuration, whereas in <b>high</b> <b>field</b> designs, the maximum peak magnetic fields are created on coils lying on the inner diameter of the magnet bore. This becomes a critical aspect of any <b>high</b> <b>field</b> design, since there appears to be much less freedom of design at <b>higher</b> <b>fields,</b> due to the inherent limitations posed by peak magnetic fields on superconductors. Our findings also indicate that at low fields, 3 T and less, reverse current coils can be used to shorten superconducting magnets, whereas at <b>high</b> <b>field,</b> above 3 T, this is not necessarily the case, due to the large peak fields produced between adjacent, alternating current coils...|$|R
