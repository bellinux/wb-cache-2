An automated parameterization method was used that involves fitting {{the potential to}} vibrational frequencies and eigenvectors derived from quantum-chemical calculations. The partial charges were derived by <b>fitting</b> <b>point</b> charges to quantum-chemically calculated electrostatic potentials. To model {{the dynamics of the}} hydroxyl groups of the sterols correctly, the parameter set was refined to reproduce the energy barrier for the rotation of the hydroxyl group around the carbon connected to the hydroxyl of each sterol. The frequency-matching plots show good agreement between the CHARMM and quantum chemical normal modes. The parameters are tested in a molecular dynamics simulation of the cholesterol crystal structure. The experimental geometry and cell dimensions are well reproduced. The force field derived here is also useful for simulating other sterols such as the phytosterols sigmasterol, and campesterol, and a variety of steroids...|$|E

40|$|Hanging models play an {{important}} role in shaping a structure since a very early age, and were favored by A. Gaudi, H. Isler, F. Otto and other architects or engineers. Nowadays, with the development of numerical analysis theory and computer technique, it is more accurate and convenient to simulate these physical models via numerical means. Based on the background, this paper presents a numerical form-finding method of gridshell structures generated from hanging-chain models by using Dynamic Relaxation method and the NURBS technique, which aims to obtain more complex structural forms with multiple control points. This method uses global NURBS surface interpolation to describe the initial cable-net model passing through the given target points, which serve as the <b>fitting</b> <b>points</b> of the NURBS surface. The cable elements of the cable-net are not allowed to elongate after form-finding, and clearly, this kind of cable-nets belongs to geometrically unstable system, whose form-finding process of it has a very strong nonlinearity. To solve this problem, it uses the Dynamic Relaxation method, which can complete the form-finding of geometrically unstable systems but with some special sets, to get the equilibrium form of the hanging cable-net under the gravity. However, this structural form may no longer pass through the given target points, and then it introduces the inverse iteration method to adjust the coordinates of the <b>fitting</b> <b>points</b> of the NURBS, which actually means to find the initial structural form which after form-finding can just right meet the target requirements. At last, some numerical examples are presented to demonstrate the validity of the proposed method in this paper. Structural Mechanic...|$|R

The equations of the thermodynamics of mixtures allow to calculate the specific partial thermodynamical {{properties of}} water and polymer in the hydrogel as a function of its water content. Partial volume of water in the gel at low activities is slightly lower than the specific volume of water in the liquid state. The partial enthalpy and entropy differ significantly from those of pure water at the lowest water contents, and tend to those of pure water for activities close to one. The mutual interaction between the gel's components is discussed through the residual part of the mixing free energy. This function is positive for all gel compositions, suggesting that, on the average, the water–polymer interactions are not stronger than the water–water or polymer–polymer interactions, and that the affinity of water to mix homogeneously with the polymer has a combinatorial origin. The composition dependence of the Flory–Huggins interaction parameter is calculated and explained in terms on the residual free energy.

Tracks were also computed using either the classical gray T(tau,T_eff) relation or that derived by Krishna Swamy (1966) to derive the boundary pressure. The latter predict warmer giant branches (by 150 K) at solar abundances than those based on gray or MARCS atmospheres, which happens to be in good agreement with the inferred temperatures of giants in the open cluster M 67 from the latest (V-K) -T_eff relations. Most of the calculations assumed Z= 0. 0125 (Asplund et al.), though a few models were computed for Z= 0. 0165 (Grevesse & Sauval) to determine the dependence of the tracks on Z_. Grids of "scaled solar, differentially corrected" (SDC) atmospheres were also computed to try to improve upon theoretical MARCS models. When they were used as boundary conditions, the resultant tracks agreed very well with those based on a standard scaled-solar (e. g., Krishna Swamy) T(tau,T_eff) relation, independently of the assumed metal abundance.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Whereas German suicide rates {{had a clear}} {{decreasing}} tendency between 1991 and 2006, they {{increased from}} 2007 to 2010. Deeper analyses of suicide data might help to understand better this change. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze 1) whether recent trends can be related to changes in specific suicide methods and diverge by gender and age; 2) whether the decrease of suicide rates before 2007 as well as the increase from 2007 to 2010 are driven by the same suicide method. METHODS: Analyses were based on suicide data from the Federal Statistical Office of Germany. For 1998 - 2010, 136. 583 suicide cases of men and women with known age and suicide method could be identified. These data were analyzed by joinpoint regression analysis, allowing identification of the best <b>fitting</b> <b>point</b> in time ("joinpoint") at which the suicide rate significantly changes in magnitude or direction. RESULTS: The national downward trend between 1998 and 2007 was mainly due to corresponding changes in self-poisoning by other means than drugs (e. g., pesticides) (annual percentage change (APC) ≤ - 4. 33), drowning (APC ≤ - 2. 73), hanging (APC ≤ - 2. 69) and suicides by firearms (APC ≤ - 1. 46) in both genders. Regarding the overall increase of age-adjusted suicide rates in Germany 2007 - 2010, mainly the increase of self-poisoning (e. g., by drugs) and "being overrun" (APC ≥ 1. 50) contributed to this trend. LIMITATIONS: The true suicide rates might have been underestimated because of errors in the official death certificates. CONCLUSIONS: Increase in suicide rates in Germany since 2007 went along with corresponding changes for "being overrun" and "self-poisoning". Copycat suicides following the railway suicide of the goalkeeper Robert Enke partly contributed to the results. Thus, prevention of Werther effects and limitation of the availability of high pack sizes for drugs are of special relevance for the reversal of this trend...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to explore the sensitivity to intermodal asynchrony in audiovisual speech with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss. Based on previous studies, two opposing expectations were an increase in sensitivity, as hearing-impaired listeners heavily rely on lipreading in daily life, and a reduction in sensitivity, as hearing-impaired listeners tend to be elderly and advanced age could potentially impair audiovisual integration. Design: Adults with normal (N = 11, ages between 23 and 50 yrs) and impaired hearing (N = 11, ages between 54 and 81 yrs, the pure-tone average between 42 and 67 dB HL) participated in two experiments. In the first experiment, the synchrony judgments were recorded for varying intermodal time differences in audiovisual sentence recordings. In the second experiment, the intelligibility of audiovisual and audio-only speech was measured in speech-shaped noise, and correlations were explored between the synchrony window and intelligibility scores for individual listeners. Results: Similar to previous studies, a sensitivity window on the order of a few hundred milliseconds was observed with all listeners. The average window shapes did not differ between normal-hearing and hearing-impaired groups; however, there was large individual variability. Individual windows were quantified by Gaussian curve <b>fitting.</b> <b>Point</b> of subjective simultaneity, a measure of window peak shift from the actual synchrony point, and full-width at half-maximum, a measure of window duration, were not correlated with participant's age or the degree of hearing loss. Points of subjective simultaneity were also not correlated with speech intelligibility scores. A moderate negative correlation that was significant at most conditions was observed between the full-width at half-maximum values and intelligibility scores. Conclusions: Contrary to either expectation per se, there was no indication of an effect of hearing impairment or age on the sensitivity to intermodal asynchrony in audiovisual speech. It is possible that the negative effects of aging were balanced with the positive effects of increased sensitivity due to reliance on visual cues with hearing impairment. The listeners, normal hearing or hearing impaired, who were more sensitive to asynchrony (with narrower synchrony windows) tended to understand speech in noise better, with both audio-only and audiovisual speech. The practical implication of the results is that delays in audio or video signals of communication systems would affect hearing-impaired listeners in a manner similar to normal-hearing listeners, and due to the importance of visual cues for the hearing-impaired listeners, special attention should be given to limit these delays...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, a {{study is}} {{presented}} in which statistical methodologies were applied to evaluate the measurement of step gauges on an X-ray computed tomography (CT) system. In particular, the effects of step gauge material density and orientation were investigated. The step gauges consist of uni- and bidirectional lengths. By confirming the repeatability of measurements made on the test system, the number of required scans {{in the design of}} experiment (DOE) was reduced. The statistical model was checked using model adequacy principles; model adequacy checking is an important step in validating the applicability of a model to fitting experimental results. If the residuals after fitting the model are normally distributed (normality test), then the residuals represent random errors in the data. If the normality test is not satisfied, the model is said to fit the data poorly. If the model fit to the data were correct, the residuals would approximate the random errors (also called normality). The most common significance level is alpha = 0. 05; for normality to be satisfied, the P value for the residuals must not be smaller than 0. 05. The initial results show that the residuals failed the normality test due to a small P value (P < 0. 005). Some remedies in achieving a larger P value include (1) fitting a different model, (2) evaluating the data differently and (3) excluding outliers. The authors determined that there were too few data to delete outliers. Instead, discussions and conclusions were carried out based on main effect and interaction plots. It means that the conclusions were not based on the analysis of variance (ANOVA). The following conclusions can be drawn: X-ray scattering is more problematic for dense metal parts. Thus, the statement of "influence of orientation'' should be constrained by the material type. But {{it is important to have}} in mention that probably the repeatability of the vertical case is much worse. This can be documented experimentally, by tracing back to the fitting quality of the planes. The <b>fitting</b> <b>point</b> deviation of these planes are typically larger when dense metal step gauges are scanned vertically; this can also be done with simulation, as it is "assumed'' that the large errors related to "vertical direction'' might be caused by X-ray scattering noise, this theory can be tested by simulating CT scans of metal and plastic step gauge without X-ray scattering and see whether "vertical direction'' is still worse for aluminium step gauge. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A multiwavelength {{analysis}} of M 31 ’s globular clusters and their low mass X-ray binaries by Mark B. Peacock Globular clusters (GCs) are dense groups of thousands {{to millions of}} stars. They are often very old systems with ages {{similar to those of}} their host galaxies and the early Universe. These clusters provide unique laboratories for astrophysical research and have been used by countless studies to improve our understanding of the Universe. In particular, they are ideal locations for studying stellar evolution and the formation and evolution of galaxies. They also provide unique locations for studying individual exotic objects, such as X-ray binaries. In this study, I investigate the properties of GCs in the nearby spiral galaxy, M 31. This galaxy hosts the largest GC population in the Local Group. This, combined with its relative proximity to us, makes it an important bridge between studies of Galactic and extragalactic GCs. However, previous catalogues of these clusters have suffered from significant inhomogeneity and contamination from both stars and galaxies. In this contribution I present new, homogeneous, optical and near infra-red photometry of the M 31 GC system. In addition to this, the structural parameters for over half of the known clusters are determined through <b>fitting</b> <b>point</b> spread function convolved King models to their density profiles. This photometry is used to remove significant contamination from non-cluster sources in previous cluster catalogues and to confirm a large population of young clusters in the M 31 cluster system. Determining the properties of these clusters is very important in investigating both this, and other, GC systems. It is also of great benefit in investigating the exotic objects hosted by these clusters. I combine these data with archived XMM Newton observations, to study the low mass X-ray binaries (LMXBs) in M 31 ’s clusters. LMXBs are known to be relatively common in GCs and, through studying the properties of the GCs which host them, it is possible to investigate the effects of cluster environment on the formation and evolution of these systems. From this work, I demonstrate that the presence of LMXBs is proportional to the stellar collision rate of a GC. This provides good observational evidence that these LMXBs are formed through dynamical interactions. These data are also used to consider the morphology of horizontal branch stars in M 31 ’s GCs. Published GALEX ultraviolet observations of these clusters are used as a probe into their hot stellar populations. From this work, I propose a relationship between the core density of these clusters and their ultraviolet colour. This result suggests that the formation of (FUV bright) extreme horizontal branch stars may be enhanced in dense stellar environments through stellar interaction...|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop an integrated approach for the computation of Height Reference Surfaces (HRS) {{in the context of}} GNSS positioning. For this purpose, the method of Digital Finite Element Height Reference Surface software (DFHRS) is extended, allowing the use of physical observations in addition to geometrical observation types. Particular emphasis is put on (i) using Adjusted Spherical Cap Harmonics to locally model the potential, (ii) developing a parameterization of coefficients for a least squares estimation, and (iii) optimizing the combination of data needed to calculate the coefficients. In particular, the selection of the terrestrial gravity measurements, height <b>fitting</b> <b>points</b> with known ellipsoidal and normal heights, {{and the use of the}} available global gravity models as additional observations are investigated. One of the main motivations is the need to compute a high precise local potential model with the ability to derive all components related to the potential W. These observation components are gravity, quasigeoid height, the geoid height, deflections of the vertical in the east and north direction (), the <b>fitting</b> <b>points</b> and the apriori information in terms of coefficients of a local potential model derived from the developed methods of a mapping of a global one. This thesis provides a method for local and global gravity and geoid modelling. The Spherical Cap Harmonics (SCH) for modeling the Earth potential are introduced in detail, including their relationship to the normal Spherical Harmonics (SH). The different types of Spherical Cap Harmonics, such as Adjusted Spherical Cap Harmonics (ASCH), Translated-Origin Spherical Cap Harmonics (TOSCH) and the Revised Spherical Cap Harmonics (RSCH) are discussed. The ASCH method was chosen in further for modeling the local gravitational potential due to its simple principle, that the integer degree and order Legendre functions are preserved and lead to faster implementation algorithms. The ASCH are used in this thesis to transform the global gravity models like EGM 2008 or EIGEN 05 c to local gravity models, guaranteeing a much smaller number of coefficients and making the calculations faster and easier. Tests are applied to validate the use of ASCH for local gravity and potential modelling, with ASCH coefficients calculated in test areas. These coefficients were used to calculate the values of potential or the gravity for new points and then compared with the real measured values and reference values from global models. The tests include the transformation of global gravity models like EGM 2008 and EIGEN 05 c to ASCH models and the integrated solution of heterogeneous groups of data including terrestrial gravity data, height <b>fitting</b> <b>points</b> and the locally mapped global gravity models. The region of the federal state of Baden-Württemberg in Germany was used as a test area for this thesis to prove the concept. Nearly 15000 terrestrially measured gravity observations were used to implement an ASCH model in degree and order of 300 in order to achieve a resolution of 0. 01 mGal that corresponds to the measurement accuracy. ...|$|R

A test campaign for the deviation of a material law for silicone, used as secondary sealant in the edge seal system, is presented. The verified FE-model is implemented in a selected insulation glass unit, and the influence of the edge distance of the <b>point</b> <b>fitting,</b> as well as the edge bond stiffness and geometry on the stress peak at the borehole is investigated. In addition, the size of the so called ‘local area’ is adjusted for insulation glass units...|$|R

SLAM can help the robot to plan and execute a collision-free trajectory from the current configuration to the target configuration, so it is essential and critical for the mobile robot's autonomous navigation and effective task execution. SLAM plays a quite important role {{in a wide range of}} application fields, from indoor to outdoor, from industry to military, from terrain, submarine to outer space, etc. In indoor dynamic scenarios where there are moving objects, robust SLAM is also important for the mobile robot to co-exist with humans safely and to improve the capability in robot's estimation for its own state of pose and the surrounding world model. The research goal of this dissertation is to design, implement and validate Graph-SLAM algorithms for mobile robots in indoor office-like dynamic scenarios. Graph-SLAM belongs to the category that addresses the issues of localization and mapping in a hierarchical way, where a topological graph is constructed to represent the robot poses, the local relative motion constraints between them are estimated as the edges of the graph and the global consistent registration is performed {{to estimate}} the trajectory of the robot. Graph-SLAM can lead to much accurate results approaching the ground truth. The overview of the designed and implemented Graph-SLAM algorithm includes the following three parts: scan matching {{to estimate the}} local relative roto-translation, batch optimization to estimate the global mobile robot's trajectory, and the global line-feature-based mapping to construct the global line-feature model of the environment. The details of each chapter are briefly shown as follows: On the local level, moving-object-detection based scan matching is accomplished: first, conditioned-Hough-Transform-based segmentation is performed to extract and group the small-scale line-feature-candidate samples; second, occupancy-analysis-based moving-object detection is executed to detect and discard the segments corresponding to the moving objects; third, linear-regression-based line-feature matching is applied to merge the similar small-scale line features into larger-scale line features, and also to match the larger-scale line features in order to estimate the roto-translation values. The experiments will prove the effectiveness of the algorithm to estimate the relative roto-translation value even faced with the disturbances of the moving objects in the dynamic scenario. On the global level, the motion constraints computed from scan matching between the immediate consecutive, the close-by-but-not-adjacent robot poses are used to construct the topological graph, and the least-square cost function associated with the graph is optimized by a linear solution. The experimental tests dealing with the publicly available dataset will prove the effectiveness of the batch optimization method, which is quite efficient and accurate. In addition, for the local-level relative roto-translation estimation, yet-another robust wall-detection-based scan-matching algorithm is proposed and implemented to enhance the capability of the previous scan-matching algorithm: first, conditioned-Hough-Transform-and-linear-regression-based line-segment detection is performed to detect the line segments from the raw laser-scan-range data; second, wall detection is done to select the line segments that correspond to the walls of the environment; third, matching by <b>fitting</b> <b>point</b> to line is executed to estimate the roto-translation value. The experimental result will verify the effectiveness of this algorithm even when the moving object is close to the wall and there is much rotation error in the input odometry data. Moreover, on the global level, with the knowledge of the estimated global robot poses for the transfo...|$|E

50|$|According to Webster's Dictionary, {{the word}} hussar {{stems from the}} Hungarian huszár, which in turn {{originates}} from the Serbian хусар (husar, or гусар, gusar), meaning brigand (because early hussars' shock troops tactics used against the Ottoman army resembled that of brigands; in modern Serbian the meaning of gusar is limited to sea pirate), from the Medieval Latin cursarius (cf. the English word corsair).On the other hand, 'húsz' means twenty in Hungarian whilst 'ár' is a unit of land measurement or acre. Hussars are so named as they were a form of military levy whereby any land owner with twenty acres was duty bound to provide a mounted and equipped soldier to the king's army at their own expense. The elaborate uniforms were based on traditional Magyar horseman's clothes with highly braided, tight riding breeches, close <b>fitting</b> <b>pointed</b> boots and a sash around the waist.|$|R

In this work, three isotherms were obtained (at 298 K, at 313 K and at 333 K) from natural pretreated Na+ clinoptilolite. The ion exchange was carried out with Cr+ 3 ions. The isotherms? shape {{is similar to the}} classical type "b" isotherm, according to the arrangement proposed by Breck (1984). Mathematical fitting was applied to the experimental points (Table Curve software) to obtain a representative curve thereof. From such <b>fittings,</b> <b>points</b> were simulated and then used to construct the Kielland plots, whose shape was associated with an ion exchange mechanism. Straight lines were obtained as an indication that, although the zeolite used is of natural occurrence and presents impurities such as mordenite and clays, only one site is involved in the ion exchange proces...|$|R
