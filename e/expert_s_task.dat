40|$|An {{important}} emerging {{requirement for}} computing systems {{is the ability}} to adapt at run time, taking advantage of local computing devices, and coping with dynamically changing resources. Three specific technical challenges in satisfying this requirement are to (1) select an appropriate set of applications or services to carry out a user 2 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>task,</b> (2) allocate (possible scarce) resources among those applications, and (3) reconfigure the applications or resource assignments if the situation changes. In this paper we show how to provide a shared infrastructure that automates configuration decisions given a specification of the user 2 ̆ 2 <b>s</b> <b>task.</b> The heart of the approach is an analytical model and an efficient algorithm that can be used at run time to make near-optimal (re) configuration decisions.

We propose to use a single body-worn wireless inertial node placed on the chest of a patient. The experimental investigation is carried out considering 24 PD pa-tients, comparing the obtained results directly with the kinematic characterization of the leg agility (LA) task performed by the same set of patients.

40|$|Background: Verbal fluency is {{a measure}} of {{cognitive}} flexibility and word search strategies that is widely used to characterize impaired cognitive function. Despite the wealth of research on identifying and characterizing distinct aspects of verbal fluency, the anatomic and functional substrates of retrieval-related search and post-retrieval control processes still have not been fully elucidated. Methods: Twenty-one native English-speaking, healthy, right-handed, adult volunteers (mean age = 31 years; range = 21 – 45 years; 9 F) took part in a block-design functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) study of free recall, covert word generation tasks when guided by phonemic (P), semantic-category (C), and context-based fill-in–the-blank sentence completion (S) cues. General linear model (GLM), Independent Component Analysis (ICA), and psychophysiological interaction (PPI) were used to further characterize the neural substrate of verbal fluency as a function of retrieval cue type. Results: Common localized activations across P, C, and <b>S</b> <b>tasks</b> occurred in the bilateral superior and left inferior frontal gyrus, left anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral supplementary motor area (SMA), and left insula. Differential task activations were centered in the occipital, temporal and parietal regions as well as the thalamus and cerebellum. The context-based fluency task, i. e., the <b>S</b> <b>task,</b> elicited higher differential brain activity in a lateralized frontal-temporal network typically engaged in complex language processing. P and C tasks elicited activation in limited pathways mainly within the left frontal regions. ICA and PPI results of the <b>S</b> <b>task</b> suggested that brain regions distributed across both hemispheres, extending beyond classical language areas, are recruited for lexical-semantic access and retrieval during sentence completion. Conclusion: Study results support the hypothesis of overlapping, as well as distinct, neural networks for covert word generation when guided by different linguistic cues. The increased demand on word retrieval is met by the concurrent recruitment of classical as well as non-classical language-related brain regions forming a large cognitive neural network. The retrieval-related search and post-retrieval control processes that subserve verbal fluency, therefore, reverberates across distinct functional networks as determined by respective task demands...|$|R

40|$|Intrinsic {{motivation}} is {{widely viewed as}} a major force behind performance and creativity, and much scholarly {{attention has been paid}} to the positive effects of intrinsic motivation. However, while existing research has examined how intrinsic motivation in one task affects performance in that task, little research has examined how intrinsic motivation in one task affects performance in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> other <b>tasks</b> in a multiple-task environment. This is an important question as workplaces are increasingly becoming a multiple-task environment where one task 2 ̆ 7 s dynamics are influenced by another task 2 ̆ 7 s dynamics. In this dissertation, I explore the nature of the cross-task effects of intrinsic motivation. The main hypothesis is that intrinsic motivation in one task has a curvilinear relationship with performance in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> other <b>tasks</b> such that when intrinsic motivation in the focal task is medium, it helps performance in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> other <b>tasks</b> whereas when intrinsic motivation in the focal task is high, it hurts performance in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> other <b>tasks.</b> Under medium intrinsic motivation in the focal task, spillover of energy savings and positive affect prevails between the focal task and other tasks, but under high intrinsic motivation in the focal task, contrast and goal shielding effects prevail blocking the motivation and attention for the other tasks. Across three studies (one laboratory experiment and two field studies), I find that intrinsic motivation in a task indeed has curvilinear effects on performance in one 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> other <b>tasks</b> as well as overall performance variance across tasks, especially with high polychronicity. The theory and findings of this dissertation enhance our understanding of the complexities of intrinsic motivation and advance knowledge about motivation and performance management. ...|$|R
