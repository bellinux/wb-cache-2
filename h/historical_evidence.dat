5|$|According to Angharad Llwyd (a 19th-century {{historian}} of Anglesey), the first church on {{this site was}} reportedly established in about 616.

5|$|In The Warlord Chronicles (1995–97), Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead, a {{place of}} {{internal}} exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the 'dead' (people suffering insanity) from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland.

5|$|In {{addition}} to <b>historical</b> <b>evidence,</b> the coins' use of Ge'ez provides valuable linguistic information.

5|$|Mainstream Indian {{cultural}} elements {{coexist with}} traditional {{practices of the}} ethnic groups, such as various dances to celebrate religious occasions, weddings and festivities; the use of locally crafted musical instruments and clothes; and the worship of regional deities.

5|$|Richard and Gloucester's {{campaign}} of 1392 never happened, but Richard did leave for Ireland in 1394 {{with a large}} army, accompanied by John Othelake, who had succeeded Chandos as Ireland King of Arms in 1393. No details are given of Othelake's career as Ireland King of Arms, although he certainly had a connection with Ireland as an officer of arms to the Earl of March in 1381.

5|$|The {{book was}} welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its {{arguments}} convincing and its synthesis {{of a large}} volume of <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> compelling. It also aroused criticism {{on a variety of}} grounds, such as whether deaths per capita was an appropriate metric, Pinker's atheism, lack of moral leadership, excessive focus on Europe (though the book covers other areas), the interpretation of historical data, and its image of indigenous people.|$|E
5|$|There is {{insufficient}} <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> {{to support the}} claim he knew any skills beyond archery. Contemporary records never once mention Zhou teaching Yue boxing. Despite this, various wuxia novels and folk legends have attributed many different military and supernatural skills to Zhou. These range from mastery of the bow, double swords and Chinese spear to that of Wudang hard qigong, Chuojiao boxing and even X-ray vision. Wang Shaotang's folktale even represents him as a master of Drunken Eight Immortals boxing.|$|E

5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the two systems {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
5|$|It is {{not certain}} that the slaves were a {{homogeneous}} group {{under the leadership of}} Spartacus. While this is the unspoken assumption of the Roman historians, this may be the Romans projecting their own hierarchical view of military power and responsibility on the ad hoc organization of the slaves. Certainly other slave leaders are mentioned—Crixus, Oenomaus, Gannicus, and Castus—and it cannot be told from the <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> whether they were aides, subordinates, or even equals leading groups of their own and traveling in convoy with Spartacus' people.|$|E

Around the 1860s, {{at the height of the}} iron and steel era, a pier and a deep-water dock were built by the Bristol & Portishead Pier and Railway to accommodate the large ships that had difficulty in reaching Bristol Harbour. They brought valuable cargoes from across the globe and exported local products overseas. Ships carrying coal were commonplace in Portishead Docks.|$|E

5|$|The Javan rhino is {{much less}} vocal than the Sumatran; very few Javan rhino vocalizations have ever been recorded. Adults have no known predators other than humans. The species, {{particularly}} in Vietnam, is skittish and retreats into dense forests whenever humans are near. Though a valuable trait from a survival standpoint, it has made the rhinos difficult to study. Nevertheless, when humans approach too closely, the Javan rhino becomes aggressive and will attack, stabbing with the incisors of its lower jaw while thrusting upward with its head. Its comparatively antisocial behavior may be a recent adaptation to population stresses; <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests they, like other rhinos, were once more gregarious.|$|E
5|$|The {{date of the}} {{appearance}} of smallpox is not settled. It most likely evolved from a terrestrial African rodent virus between 68,000 and 16,000 years ago. The wide range of dates {{is due to the}} different records used to calibrate the molecular clock. One clade was the variola major strains (the more clinically severe form of smallpox) which spread from Asia between 400 and 1,600 years ago. A second clade included both alastrim minor (a phenotypically mild smallpox) described from the American continents and isolates from West Africa which diverged from an ancestral strain between 1,400 and 6,300 years before present. This clade further diverged into two subclades at least 800 years ago. A second estimate has placed the separation of variola from Taterapox at 3000–4000 years ago. This is consistent with archaeological and <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> regarding {{the appearance}} of smallpox as a human disease which suggests a relatively recent origin. However, if the mutation rate is assumed to be {{similar to that of the}} herpesviruses, the divergence date between variola from Taterapox has been estimated to be 50,000 years ago. While this is consistent with the other published estimates, it suggests that the archaeological and <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> is very incomplete. Better estimates of mutation rates in these viruses are needed.|$|E

5|$|The land {{on which}} Denmark Street stands was {{formerly}} part of the grounds of St Giles Hospital, founded as a house for lepers in the early 12th century by Henry I's wife Matilda (Maud). In 1612, it was recorded as being owned by Tristram Gibbs. The grounds were laid out for development {{during the reign of}} James II and developed by Samuel Fortrey and Jacques Wiseman in the late 1680s. <b>Historical</b> <b>evidence</b> suggests the street was formed between 1682 and 1687, as it was not shown on Morden and Lea's Map of 1682.

5|$|The land walls {{run through}} the heart of modern Istanbul, with a belt of parkland {{flanking}} their course. They are pierced at intervals by modern roads leading westwards out of the city. Many sections were restored during the 1980s, with financial support from UNESCO, but the restoration program has been criticized for destroying <b>historical</b> <b>evidence,</b> focusing on superficial restoration, the use of inappropriate materials and poor quality of work. This became apparent in the 1999 earthquakes, when the restored sections collapsed while the original structure underneath remained intact. The threat posed by urban pollution, and the lack of a comprehensive restoration effort, prompted the World Monuments Fund to include them on its 2008 Watch List of the 100 Most Endangered Sites in the world.|$|E
5|$|The three sonatas are {{cyclically}} interconnected by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying {{together all}} movements in each sonata, {{as well as}} all three sonatas together; consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and similarities to other Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often understood as highly personal and autobiographical. Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on <b>historical</b> <b>evidence</b> concerning the composer's life.|$|E
