40|$|Founded in 1665, the Journal des sçavans and the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society are early {{examples}} of what we would today call 'user-generated content' ('UGC'). The articles published in these journals {{took the form of}} letters announcing a discovery or a scientific observation. But although these journals are seminal {{examples of}} scientific UGC, processes of scholarly exchange existed much earlier, usually in the form of private correspondence between scientists (which is why scholarly <b>journals</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day</b> sometimes still have the word 'Letters' in their name). Publication of these letters in a journal was, of course, a more efficient way of spreading the news of scientific discovery and delineating claims over first discovery, but initially it wasn't the invention of a new form; it was the evolution of older, less organised, practices of content creation. Other examples of this process are well known: newspapers and periodicals began printing letters to the editor as early as the eighteenth century; more recently, the apparently casual observations that once would have passed as workplace gossip or dinner-party conversation have migrated onto the internet in the form of blogs and short messages; amusing family moments are uploaded to YouTube; lullabies that once were passed down orally through generations are recorded and sold. The dynamic at work here is one of making small-scale cultural production more visible, more regulated, more commercial and more institutional. But although recent scholarship recognises this dynamic, UGC remains a category typically defined in relation to its normative opposites: the professionally produced content that is supported and sustained by commercial media businesses or public organisations, and the purportedly docile and passive modes of consumption associated with mass analog media. Contemporary UGC is often imagined as a disruptive, creative force, something spontaneously emerging from the creativity of individual users newly enabled as expressive agents by digital technologies. The analysis that derives from this is focused on the ostensibly revolutionary changes ushered in by UGC; putatively new forms of media subjectivity, such as the 'pro-am' or 'prosumer'; or on how 'old media' businesses respond to the UGC 'challenge'. In this chapter, we see UGC not in opposition to 'producer media', or in hybridised forms of combination with them, but in relation to a concept that connects new media studies with wider social science: that of informality in media production, distribution and consumption...|$|R
40|$|On March 23, 1989, the Exxon Valdez ran aground in Alaska 2 ̆ 7 s Prince William Sound and {{released}} over 250, 000 barrels of crude oil, resulting in 1300 miles of oiled shoreline. The Exxon spill ignited {{a debate about}} the appropriate compensation for damages suffered, and among economists, a debate concerning the adequacy of methods to value public goods, particularly when the good in question has limited direct use, such as the pristine natural environment of the spill region. The efficacy of stated preference methods generally, and contingent valuation in particular, is no mere academic debate. Billions of dollars are at stake. An influential symposium appearing in this journal in 1994 provided arguments for and against the credibility of these methods, and an extensive research program published in academic <b>journals</b> has continued <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>day.</b> <b>This</b> paper assesses what occurred in this academic literature between the Exxon spill and the BP disaster. We will rely on theoretical developments, neoclassical and behavioral paradigms, empirical and experimental evidence, and a clearer elucidation of validity criteria to {{provide a framework for}} readers to ponder the question of the validity of contingent valuation and, more generally, stated preference methods...|$|R
