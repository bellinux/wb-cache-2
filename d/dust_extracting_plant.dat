40|$|Background: House <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> {{is used in}} {{conventional}} immunotherapy for house dust-mite (HDM) allergic rhinitis in Japan. However, an alternative administration route is desired. The aims of the present double blind, placebo-controlled trial were to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy and safety of sublingual immunotherapy (SLIT) with house <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> in pediatric patients with HDM allergic rhinitis. Methods: The study population comprised 31 subjects (21 males and 10 females) aged from 7 to 15 years old. Twenty patients (the active group) received house <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> and 11 received placebo via sublingual administration. Extract or placebo (1 ml) was administered at 10 -fold dilution once weekly for 40 weeks. During the study period, the subjects recorded their daily nasal symptoms and use (dose and frequency) of other medications in a nasal allergy diary. Results: The symptom scores in the active group began to decrease about 24 weeks after initiation of treatment and {{significant differences between the}} active and placebo groups were observed after 30 weeks. The average scores for the last four weeks of the study were significantly lower than those for the first four weeks in the active group but not in the placebo group. The only local adverse effect was a bitter taste reported by one patient. There were no other local or systemic adverse effects associated with SLIT.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether short-term exposure to an aqueous extract of hog barn dust increases macromolecular efflux from the intact hamster cheek pouch and, if so, to begin to determine the mechanism(s) underlying this response. By using intravital microscopy, we found that suffusion of hog barn <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> onto the intact hamster cheek pouch for 60 min elicited a significant, concentration-dependent leaky site formation and increase in clearance of FITC-labeled dextran (mol mass, 70 kDa). This response was significantly attenuated by suffusion of catalase (60 U/ml), but not by heat-inactivated catalase, and by pretreatment with dexamethasone (10 mg/kg, i. v.) (p< 0. 05). Catalase had no significant effects on adenosine-induced increase in macromolecular efflux from the cheek pouch. Suffusion of hog bran <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> had no significant effects on arteriolar diameter in the cheek pouch.

The dusts generated in the CAFOs are complex mixture of fine and ultra fine particles, organic compounds, transition metals, and adsorbed toxic gases. Since each component is toxic in itself, we do not fully understand {{the relative importance of}} each component in the dust and their interactions to inducing inflammatory changes in the lung. We did extensive literature searches to understand the mechanism of dust toxicity in respiratory system. This lead to focusing on solubility of dust in lung simulant fluid, and in-vitro study of release of two common biomarkers of inflammatory processes IL- 6 and IL- 8 from lung epithelial cells. Various concentrations (1 to 50 %) of the <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> induced release of IL- 6, and IL- 8 from lung epithelial cell as indicators of pro-inflammatory changes (IL- 6), and amplification and maintenance of inflammation (IL- 8). IL- 6 release had dose dependence; peak production was seen with 25 % <b>dust</b> <b>extract.</b> IL- 8 production went down as the concentration of the <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> increased from 1 % to 25 %. However, 50 % <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> was cytotoxic to the cell leading to 10 - 15 % cell viability. At non-cytotoxic concentrations for lung epithelial cells, production of IL- 8 was reduced. These findings suggested that higher exposure concentration were required to initiate inflammation as indicated by IL- 6 release. Lower exposure concentrations (1 and 5 % extracts) were related to optimal release of IL- 8 needed to amplify and maintain the inflammatory response. Inhibition of endotoxin didn't significantly change the pattern of IL- 6 or IL- 8 release from epithelial cells. This finding suggested that at least a portion of the mechanism by which particle induced cytokine release from the lung epithelial cells was not endotoxin dependent. Heating samples at 1200 C for 5 minutes modified some of the toxic properties of the <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> but didn't completely detoxify it. We observed that longer incubation period was required to peak release for both IL- 6 and IL- 8. However, the higher concentration of sample (50 % extract) found to be cytotoxic in non-heat treated sample was no longer cytotoxic and induced both IL- 6 and IL- 8 release from the lung epithelial cells.

We present experimental evidence that substances providing protection from the development of allergic diseases can be <b>extracted</b> from <b>dust</b> collected in stables of animal farms. Methods: Stable dust was collected from 30 randomly selected farms located in rural regions of the Alps (Austria, Germany and Switzerland). The dust was homogenised with glass beads and extracted with physiological sodium chloride solution. This extract was used to modulate immune response in a well established mouse model of allergic asthma.

The biological activity of the <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> was not exclusively mediated by ipopolysaccharide. Conclusions: Stable dust from animal farms contains strong immune modulating substances.

The {{trend in the}} percentage adsorption of the adsorbate on the adsorbents decreased in the following descending: UCCR NaCCE>NaCCR> UCCE. There was justification in modifying the coir <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> since this enhanced its adsorptive capacity. However, modification of the coir residue decreased its adsorptive capacity and not justifiable. The sorption data were also subjected to Langmuir, Freundlich and Flory-Huggins adsorption isotherm models. The adsorption of Zn(II) ions on NaCl treated coir residue (NaCCR) conform to the Langmuir isotherm model with high correlation value R 2 > 0. 90. This indicated monolayer surface coverage of the Zn(II) ions on these adsorbents. The data for the adsorption on NaCl treated coir residue (NaCCR) and NaCl treated coir residue (NaCCR) at 50 o C fitted well to the Freundlich isotherm model implying a heterogeneous surface coverage of the adsorbents. All the adsorptions of Zn(II) ions on these adsorption did not fit the Flory-Huggins model. The adsorption increased with increase in temperature indicating an endothermic process.

40|$|Introduction: Asthma is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} {{disease of the}} airways. It {{is the most common}} chronic disease of childhood and the leading cause of hospitalization among children. Asthma is a complex disease with genetic, developmental, and environmental factors contributing to the disease pathogenicity. The rapid increase in asthma rates in the last several decades has led us to focus on the environmental component in asthma. Children who grow up on small traditional family farms are protected against asthma and allergies. The asthma rates among the European farmers and non-farmers are recapitulated in two US based populations, Indiana Amish and South Dakota Hutterites. The two populations share similar farming lifestyles, have large families, have similar diets, and share a common ancestry. These two communities part {{in the way in which}} they farm. The Amish practice traditional, small single family farming, while the Hutterites use state of the art technology in their highly mechanized farms that are located at the edges of their colonies. Amish are strongly protected against asthma, while Hutterites have rates that are comparable to the ones in the general population. We hypothesized that environmental exposures impact innate immune responses leading to decreased asthma risk. Methods: We utilized murine models of experimental asthma to determine the effects of aqueous extracts prepared from barn and house dust samples collected from Amish and Hutterite farms. Results: Amish house <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> reduced OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness, airway inflammation and serum IgE, while Hutterite house <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> did not. Administration of Amish <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> to mice lacking MyD 88 and TRIF, adaptors for TLR signaling, resulted in the abrogation of the protective effect seen in wild type animals. Investigation of the effects of Hutterite barn <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> revealed that this extract was able to reduce house dust mite induced airway hyperresponsiveness and airway inflammation to a degree comparable to Amish barn extract. Furthermore, a time-course analysis showed that the effects of the extracts became apparent after twelve days and include increases in airway inflammatory markers. Flow cytometry analysis of total lung cells revealed an increase in CD 3 +RORγt+γδcells that was accompanied by an increase in IL 17 expression. Lastly, transfer of gut microbiota from a healthy Amish child to germ free mice led to a time-dependent decrease in airway hyperresponsiveness and IL 13 expression in the lungs. Conclusions: We have demonstrated that Amish and Hutterite environmental products are sufficient to recapitulate profiles of asthma susceptibility seen among Amish and Hutterite children, therefore demonstrating that the environment plays an important role in asthma susceptibility in this communities. Innate immunity plays an essential role in mediating the protective effects of Amish <b>dust</b> <b>extracts.</b> Amish fecal microbiota might influence asthma rates among the Amish...|$|R

Cotton bracts extract released histamine from pig lung tissue whereas in the same preparations methyl piperonylate was inactive. The active releasing agent was highly water soluble but could not be steam distilled from, nor extracted by, ether from bracts extract. These physicochemical properties are not characteristic of methyl piperonylate.

40|$|Accumulating {{evidence}} {{is suggesting that}} exposure to some environmental contaminants may alter adipogenesis, resulting in accumulation of adipocytes, and often significant weight gain. Thus these types of contaminants are {{often referred to as}} obesogens. Many of these contaminants act via the activation (i. e. agonism) of the peroxisome proliferator activated receptor &# 947; (PPAR&# 947;) nuclear receptor. To date, very few chemicals have been identified as possible PPAR&# 61543; ligands. In the thesis, our goal was to determine the PPAR&# 947; ligand binding potency and activation of several groups of major semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs) that are ubiquitously detected in indoor environments, including flame retardants such as polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) and Firemaster 550 (FM 550), and other SVOCs such as phthalates, organotins, halogenated phenols and bisphenols. Additional attention was also given to the potential activity of the major metabolites of several of these compounds. Since the primary sink for many of these SVOCs is dust, and dust ingestion has been confirmed as an important pathway for SVOCs accumulation in humans, the potential PPAR&# 61543; binding and activation in extracts from environmentally relevant dust samples was also investigated. Previous studies have also shown that SVOCs sorbed to organic matrices (e. g., soil and sediment), were only partially bioaccessible (bioavailable), but it was unclear how bioaccessible these compounds are from indoor dust matrices. In addition, bioactivation of SVOCs (via metabolism) could exacerbate their PPAR&# 61543; potency. Therefore, to adequately assess the potential risk of PPAR&# 947; activation from exposure to SVOC mixtures in house dust, it is essential that one also investigates the bioaccessibility and bioactivation of these chemicals following ingestion. In the first research aim of this thesis, the bioaccessibility and bioactivation of several important SVOCs in house dust was investigated. To accomplish this, Tenax beads (TA) encapsulated within a stainless steel insert were used as an infinite adsorption sink to estimate the dynamic absorption of a suite of flame retardants (FRs) commonly detected in indoor dust samples, and from a few polyurethane foam samples for comparison. Experimental results demonstrate that the bioaccessibility and stability of FRs following ingestion varies both by chemical and by matrix. Organophosphate flame retardants (OPFRs) had the highest estimated bioaccessibility (~ 80 %) compared to brominated compounds (e. g. PBDEs), and values generally decreased with increasing Log Kow, with In research aims 2 and 3, two commercially available high-throughput bioassays, a fluorescence polarization PPAR&# 61543; ligand binding assay (PolarScreenTM PPAR&# 947;-competitor assay kit, Invitrogen, Aim 2) and a PPAR&# 61543; reporter gene assay (GeneBLAzer PPAR&# 947; non-DA Assay, Invitrogen, Aim 3) were used to investigate the binding potency and activation of several groups of SVOCs and <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> with human PPAR&# 947; LBD; respectively. In the PPAR&# 61543; binding assay (Aim 2), most of the tested compounds exhibited dose-dependent binding to PPAR&# 947;. Mono(2 -ethylhexyl) tetrabromophthalate (TB-MEHP), halogenated bisphenol/phenols, triphenyl phosphate and hydroxylated PBDEs were found to be potent or moderate PPAR&# 947; ligands, based on the measured ligand binding dissociation constant (Kd). The most potent compound was 3 -OH-BDE 47, with an IC 50 of 0. 24 &# 956;M. The extent of halogenation and the position of the hydroxyl group strongly affected binding. Of the dust samples tested, 21 of 24 samples showed significant PPAR&# 61543; binding potency at a concentration of 3 mg dust equivalents (DEQ) /mL. In the PPAR&# 61543; reporter assay (Aim 3), many SVOCs or their metabolites were either confirmed (based on previous reports) or for the first time were found to be potential PPAR&# 947; agonists with various potency and efficacy. We also observed that 15 of 25 <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> examined showed an activation percentage more than 8 % (calculated activation threshold) of the maximal activation induced by rosiglitazone (positive control). In some cases, activation was as high as 50 % of the rosiglitazone activation for the <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> with the highest efficacy. Furthermore, the correlation between the reporter assay and the ligand binding assay among the house <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> was significant and positive (r = 0. 7, p In research aim 4, an effect-directed analysis (EDA) was used to identify compounds likely contributing to the observed PPAR&# 61543; activity among the <b>dust</b> <b>extract.</b> Three <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> which showed significant PPAR&# 61543; activity with approximately 25, 30, and 50 % of the maximal response induced by rosiglitazone at the highest efficacy were fractionated using normal phase high-performance liquid chromatography (NP-HPLC) and each fraction was individually tested for PPAR&# 61543; activity. Active fractions were then analyzed using gas-chromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and possible compounds identified. Three <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> showed a similar PPAR&# 61543; activity distribution among the NP-HPLC fractions. In the most active fractions, fatty acids (FAs) were identified as the most active chemicals. The concentrations of four FAs were measured in the house <b>dust</b> <b>extracts,</b> and the concentrations were found to be highly correlated with the observed PPAR&# 61543; activity. These four FAs were also tested for PPAR&# 61543; activity and found to be partial PPAR&# 61543; agonists, particularly oleic and myristic acid. To tentatively identify sources of FAs, FAs in human/animal hair, dead skin cells, and two brands of cooking oil were analyzed. We found the same FAs in those samples and there concentrations were relatively abundant, ranging from 186 to 14, 868 Âµg/g. Therefore, these results suggest that FAs are likely responsible for the observed PPAR&# 61543; activity in indoor dust. Also, this is the first study reporting on the level of FAs in dust samples. The source of these FAs in dust may be either from the cooking or accumulation of human/animal cells in indoor dust. In conclusion, this research demonstrates that many SVOCs ubiqutiously detected in house dust, and/or their metabolites, can be weak or moderate PPAR&# 61543; ligands. In addition, chemical mixtures in house dust can effectively bind to and activate PPAR&# 61543;. However, our results suggest FAs are probably responsible for these observations, and likely outcompeting the synthetic environmental contaminants present in the <b>dust</b> <b>extract.</b> Furthermore, bioactivation of contaminants present in house dust can potentially increase their affinity for PPAR&# 61543;. And lastly, the bioaccessibility and stability of SVOCs in house dust after ingestion are likely to modulate the PPAR&# 61543; activity in the environmental mixtures and should be considered in future risk assessments.

40|$|Modern, industrialized farming {{practices}} have lead to working conditions that include {{high levels of}} airborne dust. Agricultural workers inhale these complex organic dusts on a daily basis, leading to airway inflammation and higher risk for developing chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The mechanisms regulating the organic dust-induced airway inflammatory response are not well-defined. We investigated whether overexpression of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH) would lead to diminished pulmonary inflammation in an animal model of organic <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> exposure. We instilled wild-type (WT) and DDAH overexpressing mice with an aqueous organic <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> (ODE) collected from a swine confinement building. We found that inflammatory indices such as neutrophil influx and inflammatory cytokine production was lower in the DDAH overexpressing mice compared to WT after organic <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> (ODE) instillation. We went on to determine how DDAH was mediating the decrease in inflammation induced by ODE. PKC 1 and PKC 5 play {{an essential role in}} the ODE inflammatory response. In a model of lung slices from WT and DDAH overexpressing mice, we demonstrated an increase in PKC 1 and PKC 5 in the WT mice exposed to ODE. This increase was diminished in the DDAH overexpressing mice exposed to ODE. We also tested {{an important component of the}} ODE, peptidoglycan (PGN). We noted a similar decrease in neutrophils and inflammatory cytokines in the DDAH overexpressing animals instilled with PGN compared to WT. In conclusion, our studies found a role for DDAH in regulating the ODE-triggered activation of epithelial PKC 1 and PKC 5, a previously unrecognized mechanism of action. This ultimately results in diminished pulmonary inflammation.

40|$|A {{bioassay}} technique using isolated guinea-pig ileum {{was employed}} to compare the smooth muscle contractor activity of various dusts from mills in which the prevalence of byssinosis was known. The activity of dust from a mill spinning a coarse grade of cotton was several times greater than that in dust from a mill processing a fine grade of cotton. There was a similar order in the difference of the prevalence of byssinosis in these mills. However, the activities of fine cotton, flax, and jute dusts were very similar to each other, in spite of marked differences in the prevalence of byssinosis in these mills. For cotton dust, smooth muscle contractor activity was associated with all particle sizes, although {{the lowest level of}} activity was found in the largest sized fraction (less than 2 mm). Activity in the cotton <b>dust</b> <b>extracts</b> was not correlated with nitrogen, carbohydrate, or potassium content. However, about one-fifth of the activity of a cotton <b>dust</b> <b>extract</b> was associated with an insoluble particulate fraction. The possible chemical nature of the water-soluble contractor agent is discussed. It is concluded that, until the role of this agent in the pathogenesis of byssinosis has been established, the bioassay technique cannot be employed as a means of assessing the byssinogenic potential of cotton dust...|$|R
