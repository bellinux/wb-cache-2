5000|$|An Independent Inquiry into Foot and Mouth Disease in Scotland {{initiated}} by the Royal Society of Edinburgh was chaired by Professor Ian Cunningham. This embraced not only the scientific aspects of the outbreak, but also economic, social and psychological effects of the event. The costs to Scottish agriculture of the FMD outbreak were estimated to be £231m {{and the loss of}} gross revenue to tourism to be between £200-250m for Scotland as a whole. There should be a regional laboratory in Scotland, and priority be given to the development of testing procedures. The delay in imposing a ban of all movements until the third day after confirmation, the use of less than transparent modelling techniques and the failure to call on more than a fraction of the considerable relevant scientific expertise available in Scotland were criticised. The case for emergency protective vaccination, without subsequent slaughter, was supported by the evidence and it was recommended that contingency plans should include <b>emergency</b> <b>barrier,</b> or ring. vaccination as an adjunct to slaughter in clinical cases. Reservations about the consumption of meat and milk from vaccinated animals were unjustified. The importance of biosecurity at all times and throughout the agricultural industry was emphasised and SEERAD (The Scottish Executive Environment and Rural Affairs Department) should take the lead in establishing standards to be applied in normal times and at the start of an outbreak. A Chief Veterinary Officer (Scotland) should be appointed and a [...] "Territorial Veterinary Army" [...] formed from professionals to be called upon should need arise. Burial of carcasses, where conditions permit, is the preferred option for disposal of slaughtered animals. The Scottish Environment Protection Agency (SEPA) should have a clear role in contingency planning and management of any future emergency. There was a need for operational guidelines for slaughtermen. In formulating movement restriction, the dispersed nature of many holdings should be taken into account. There should be a clear and consistent strategy for compensation for slaughtered animals. The closing down of the country initially for no more than three weeks and then reopening in non-affected areas was recommended. Great importance was placed on contingency planning, on the need for regular exercises and on the setting up of an independent standing committee to monitor the maintenance of effective planning. In all, some twenty seven recommendations were made to the Scottish Executive.|$|E

According to the Romford Recorder it was erected in 1970; {{it takes the}} form of a system of {{prefabricated}} units (called the Braithwaite FliWay) that was cheaper and quicker to build than a conventional underpass or cast in-situ flyover. It is notorious for being angular, with sudden changes of slope rather than a smooth arch. The flyover was closed for several months in 2008 for remedial work carried out to the road deck, with several sections replaced. It was found upon final inspection that the bridge parapets had suffered severe corrosion. The bridge was fitted with <b>emergency</b> <b>barriers</b> which meant that traffic was restricted to one lane in the London-bound (westbound) direction only.

50|$|The two sub-types of SCB-27 {{modifications}} {{were primarily}} {{a result of}} changes in catapult technology in the early-1950s. SCB-27A vessels utilized a pair of H 8 slotted-tube hydraulic catapults, while the later SCB-27C vessels were fitted {{with a pair of}} C 11 steam catapults, a British innovation (in fact the first four installed, on Hancock and Ticonderoga, were British-built). To accommodate the catapult machinery, the SCB-27C vessels were slightly heavier (43,060 vice 40,600 tons) and after bulging wider abeam (103 vice 101 feet) than their SCB-27A sisters. Additionally, the SBC-27C carriers were equipped with jet blast deflectors, deck cooling, fuel blending facilities, <b>emergency</b> recovery <b>barrier</b> and storage and handling for nuclear weapons, which was not included in all of the SCB-27A carriers. Under SCB-27C the No. 3 (after) elevator was moved to the starboard deck edge; this elevator was located further aft on the first three SCB-27C ships than it was on the ships which received it concomitantly with an angled flight deck under the SCB-125 program.|$|R
5000|$|Trials after 1945 by the Royal Navy {{revealed}} that the new jet aircraft had slow throttle responses and could not safely use the standard deck landing technique then in use. Even in peacetime, carrier operations killed 20% of the aircrew. Goodhart therefore invented the mirror-sight deck landing system in 1951. [...] The device was first introduced in the Royal Navy in 1954 and by the US Navy in 1955. It greatly increased the safety when landing on an aircraft carrier. There was also a saving in arrester gear units and barriers - Ark Royal needed only four wires and one (<b>emergency</b> only) <b>barrier.</b> The reduction in weight and the extra space that this conferred enabled more mess-decks to be fitted in, thus reducing congestion in living spaces. It was recorded that for US carriers, the landing accident rate fell by 80% from 35 per 10,000 landings in 1954 to 7 per 10,000 landings in 1957. The US Navy awarded him the Legion of Merit for his invention and he received an undisclosed sum from the Admiralty.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Today’s {{attitudes about}} {{organized}} avalanche rescue—too late and too slow—are based on circumstances more then 20 years old. This generational difference creates {{a serious problem}} because outdated attitudes guide and affect current avalanche rescue responses. The old attitudes offer no advantages to avalanche victims and rescuers, {{and in a few}} cases have likely harmed avalanche victims. Review of more than 40 years of US avalanche rescue records, historical and contemporary avalanche education materials, identifies four main conditions that have changed significantly and optimistically; however, attitudes toward organized rescue have become more pessimistic. A generation ago communication, travel, search technology, and <b>emergency</b> care were <b>barriers</b> to organized rescue and survival, but today these same conditions benefit greatly rescuers and victims. In parts of North America and Europe, the organized rescue response sometimes occurs simultaneously with companion rescue or even replaces companion rescue. The paper reviews the changes in the four main rescue conditions, quantifies changes (where possible), and challenges commonly held assumptions. Adopting new attitudes towards organized rescue that match the current circumstances of a new generation will better help rescuers and avalanche victims. ...|$|R

40|$|Large-scale {{public health}} {{emergencies}} require a sophisticated, coordinated response involving multiple entities to protect health and minimize suffering. However, the rarity of such <b>emergencies</b> presents a <b>barrier</b> to gathering observational {{data about the}} effectiveness of the public health response before such events occur. For this reason, public health practitioners increasingly have relied on simulated emergencies, known as "exercises" as proxies to test their emergency capabilities. However, the formal evaluation of performance in these exercises, historically has been inconsistent, and there is little research to describe how data acquired from simulated emergencies actually support conclusions {{about the quality of the}} public health emergency response system. Over the past six years, we have designed and evaluated more than seventy public health emergency exercises, collaborating with public health agencies, hospitals and others to test a wide variety of systems and their capabilities. Using the data and experience that we gathered, we have developed a conceptual framework that describes the essential elements necessary to consider when applying performance measurement science to public health emergency exercises.

40|$|While {{the pursuit}} of equity of {{access to health care}} is a central {{objective}} of many health care systems, there is evidence that patients of ethnic minority descent, in lower socio-economic position (SEP) or of female gender are less likely than Whites, more affluent groups or men, respectively, to access secondary and tertiary medical care. However, it is unclear at which point in the chain of events leading from perception of need through attendance at primary/emergency care, to referral and receipt of secondary care, this inequality occurs. This study examined the influence of ethnicity, socio-economic position and gender on an individual's perception of the need and urgency for seeking health care. A random sample was selected from two large city General Practices in the UK who were sent postal questionnaires which included two clinical vignettes describing characters experiencing chest pain and discovering a lump in the armpit. The main outcome measure was response to the 'chest pain' and 'lump' vignettes in terms of immediate health care utilisation. The questionnaire survey (n= 1350, response rate 66 %) indicated that Black respondents, respondents from lower socio-economic groups and women were at least as likely to report immediate health care seeking in response to the clinical vignettes than White respondents, those from higher socio-economic groups or men. This finding was consistent across all scenarios after adjustment for interpretation of the vignette, access to health services and attitudes to health and health care. For example, those in the lowest SEP group were almost 60 % more likely to report immediate care seeking in response to the lump vignette (OR 1. 59, 95 % CI 1. 08 - 2. 33) compared to those in the highest SEP group; and Black respondents 40 % more likely (OR 1. 41, 95 % CI 0. 92 - 2. 17). This study suggests inequalities in access to health care by ethnicity, socio-economic position and gender are not related to patients in these groups failing to self-refer to primary or accident and <b>emergency</b> care, <b>barriers</b> must therefore occur at the level of health care provision.

40|$|Objective. To {{measure the}} impact of a policy change from use of telephonic and {{face-to-face}} interpreting to use of a video-interpreting network on Emergency Department (ED) care. Data Sources/Study Setting. Observational study of ED care at two California hos-pitals. Study Design. We compared tests ordered, time in the ED, and admission rates for English- and Spanish-speaking patients presenting with chest pain and abdominal pain before and after the policy change. Data Collection/Extraction Methods. Data were extracted from electronic medi-cal and billing records. Principal Findings. Mean time in the ED, mean number of laboratory tests, radiol-ogy services, electrocardiograms, and echocardiograms, and rates of hospital admis-sion for both language groups at both hospitals went down in the post-video-interpreting network period compared with the pre-video-interpreting network period. The percentage of patients leaving the ED against medical advice (AMA) increased in one hospital for both language groups; this increase was statistically significantly smal-ler in the Spanish-language group compared with the English group (p =. 04).

40|$|Background Emergency {{department}} (ED) overcrowding {{has become}} a worldwide problem {{over the past few}} years, which has been reported in USA, Canada, New Zealand and Australia. For the past two decades, ED overcrowding has also become a controversial issue in Hong Kong, due to high demand for emergency service and misuse of emergency services. In 2002, although there was a charge for emergency department visit which led to a markedly decrease (19. 1 %) of total attendance, but now the rising trend of ED overcrowding seems to resurface during past few years. This paper aims to review and synthesis causes of ED overcrowding and possible interventions so as to provide possible recommendations for emergency care in Hong Kong. Methods Literatures on ED overcrowding and potential interventions were searched from PubMed, Google Scholar and Google to locate all relevant articles in English up to May 2013. Through PubMed, ED was described using “Emergency Medicine [MeSH]” OR “emergency department” OR “emergency”, and overcrowding was described using “Crowding [MeSH]” OR “crowded” OR “overcrowding” OR “overcrowded” OR “congestion”, and interventions was described using “interventions” OR “solutions”. Besides, relevant emergency medicine literatures published from the Hong Kong Journal of Emergency Medicine were also reviewed. Results I identified and reviewed relevant articles and found that ED attendance has been steadily rising during the past decades in Hong Kong. Although the causes may be somewhat different between different countries, causes of ED overcrowding could be related to easy access to <b>emergency</b> services, <b>barriers</b> to primary care as well as specialist care, and the rising aging population which might be an important underlying cause. As the problem of ED overcrowding will have significant negative impact on patient outcomes, such as unnecessary death, two common interventions to the problem are increasing the resources and demand management. Apart from increasing resources within emergency departments to cater for the increasing demand, it is of highly significance to improve community and primary care for the needs of older people who will contribute a great proportion to ED overcrowding in the future. Conclusion Semi-urgent and non-urgent visits do account for a great proportion among the total attendance, so it is important triage these patients to alleviate the overcrowding. What’s more, pressure on EDs can be related to {{a significant increase in the}} number of elderly patients who may require more investigation or admissions, and need much longer time to manage. As a result, future health policies should focus more on the aging population to improve emergency care. published_or_final_versionPublic HealthMasterMaster of Public Healt...|$|R

As a result, a National Institutes of Health (NIH) Task Force on Research in Emergency Medicine was formed to enhance NIH support for emergency care research. Members of the NIH Task Force and academic leaders in emergency care participated in 3 Roundtable discussions to prioritize current opportunities for enhancing and conducting emergency care research. We identify key research questions essential to advancing the science of emergency care and discuss the barriers and strategies to advance research by exploring the collaboration between NIH and the emergency care community. METHODS: Experts from emergency medicine, neurology, psychiatry, and public health assembled to review critical areas in need of investigation, current gaps in knowledge, barriers, and opportunities. Neurologic emergencies included cerebral resuscitation, pain, stroke, syncope, traumatic brain injury, and pregnancy. Mental health topics included suicide, agitation and delirium, substances, posttraumatic stress, violence, and bereavement. RESULTS: Presentations and group discussion firmly established the need for translational research to bring basic science concepts into the clinical arena. A coordinated continuum {{of the health care}} system that ensures rapid identification and stabilization and extends through discharge is necessary to maximize overall patient outcomes. There is a paucity of well-designed, focused research on diagnostic testing, clinical decisionmaking, and treatments in the <b>emergency</b> setting. <b>Barriers</b> include the limited number of experienced researchers in emergency medicine, limited dedicated research funding, and difficulties of conducting research in chaotic emergency environments stressed by crowding and limited resources. Several themes emerged during the course of the roundtable discussion, including the need for development of (1) a research infrastructure for the rapid identification, consent, and tracking of research subjects that incorporates innovative informatics technologies, essential for future research; (2) diagnostic strategies and tools necessary to understand key populations and the process of medical decisionmaking, including the investigation of the pathobiology of symptoms and symptom-oriented therapies; (3) collaborative research networks to provide unique opportunities to form partnerships, leverage patient cohorts and clinical and financial resources, and share data; (4) formal research training programs integral for creating new knowledge and advancing the science and practice of emergency medicine; and (5) recognition that emergency care is part of an integrated system from emergency medical services dispatch to discharge. The NIH Roundtable 2 ̆ 2 Opportunities to Advance Research on Neurological and Psychiatric Emergencies 2 ̆ 2 created a framework to guide future emergency medicine-based research initiatives.

Survey data were enhanced using qualitative data gathered from focus groups. Three research questions guided the study: 1) To what extent do RI teachers feel prepared for a major school crisis? 2) Is there a significant relationship between teachers’ preparation for a school crisis and the following demographic variables: grade level taught, years of teaching experience, and urbanicity? 3) What are the teachers’ perceptions of the effectiveness of school emergency drills to enhance preparedness for a school crisis?^ Perceptions of school crisis preparedness were examined using survey data. ANOVAs indicated that suburban schools reported greater external building security than urban and rural districts (F = 34. 75, p =. 001). Elementary schools had a greater extent of implementing building access and identification security measures than high schools (F = 13. 28, p =. 001).

However, neither country has an integrated emergency care system that provides community access to high-quality emergency services. There has been recent interest in strengthening the emergency care systems in these countries, but before any interventions are implemented, an assessment of the current need for emergency care must be conducted, as the burden of acute disease and <b>barriers</b> to accessing <b>emergency</b> care in Zambia and Kenya remain largely undocumented. Aims and Objectives: The aim of this project was to ascertain community-based perceptions of the critical interventions necessary to improve access to emergency care in Zambia and Kenya, with the following objectives: 1. Determine the current pattern of out-of-hospital emergency care delivery at the community level. 2. Identify the communitiesâ€™ experiences with emergency conditions and the barriers they face when trying to access care. 3. Discover community-generated solutions to the paucity of emergency care in urban and rural settings. Methods: Semi-structured focus groups were piloted in Zambia with 200 participants. Results were analysed with subsequent tool refinement for Kenya. Data were collected via focus groups with 600 urban and rural community members in cities and rural villages in the 8 Kenyan provinces. Thematic analysis of community member focus groups identified frequency of emergencies, perceptions of <b>emergency</b> care, perceived <b>barriers</b> to <b>emergency</b> care, and ideas for potential interventions. Results: Analysis of the focus group data identified several common themes. Community members in Zambia and Kenya experience a wide range of medical emergencies, and they rely on family members, neighbours, and Good Samaritans for assistance. These community members frequently provide assistance with transportation to medical facilities, and also attempt some basic first aid. These communities are already assisting one another during emergencies, and are willing to help in the future. Participants in this study also identified several <b>barriers</b> to <b>emergency</b> care : a lack of community education, absent or non-functional communication systems, insufficient transportation, no triage system, a lack of healthcare providers trained in emergency care, and inadequate equipment and supplies. Conclusions: Community members in Zambia and Kenya experience a wide range of medical emergencies. There is substantial reliance on family members and neighbours for assistance, commonly with transportation. Creating community education initiatives, identifying novel transportation solutions, implementing triage in healthcare facilities, and improving receiving facility care were community-identified solutions to <b>barriers</b> to <b>emergency</b> care...|$|R
40|$|Protection of the {{agriculture}} and food infrastructure, defined as "the physical {{production and distribution}} systems critical to supporting national security and economic well-being, including all activities essential to food, feed, and fiber production, including all techniques for raising and processing livestock," {{is the responsibility of}} all stakeholders in the food supply chain (Spellman, 2008, p. 8). Though many stakeholders emerge in the chain, producers are the primary line of defense to a disease epidemic. Many factors influence livestock producers? protective action decision process in relation to biological hazards. By identifying these factors in a specific producer population, more effective preparedness programs and messages can be developed by risk communicators. The purpose and objectives of this study determined Texas and Southwestern Cattle Raisers Association (TSCRA) members? perceptions of vulnerability to the Texas cattle industry, perceived <b>emergency</b> preparedness level, <b>barriers</b> to adoption of protective actions, and sources of animal health information. This study targeted 7, 661 members of the TSCRA. An online survey questionnaire developed from previous research with similar populations allowed TSCRA members to respond to questions related to the objective of this study. A representative sample of TSCRA members from Texas, Oklahoma, and New Mexico responded to the survey. Recognizing susceptibility to biological hazards, TSCRA members identified high levels of perceived trust and reliability in local veterinarians as a source of information, consistent with previous studies. Although the majority of members reported they did not have a biosecurity plan implemented on their operations, they did recognize the necessity of preventative practices. TSCRA members were neutral on all barriers to adoption of protective actions; however, the barrier "lack of information" was rated higher by means as a barrier to adoption of protective actions. When investigating differences among noncommercial and commercial operations managed by TSCRA members, no statistical differences were identified in this study. However, when investigating differences among TSCRA members and number of cattle managed, a weak positive correlation was identified for perception of hazard by threat in relation to more animals managed. Findings of this study confirmed sources stating that {{the agriculture}} and food infrastructure is vulnerable to biological hazards as perceived by livestock owners (Motes, 2007; Spellman, 2008). Ashlock (2006) and Riley (2007) found similar perspectives of vulnerability among Oklahoma and Kansas producers further strengthening the need to protect the agriculture and food critical infrastructure as outlined by Homeland Security Presidential Directive ? 9 (HSPD- 9, 2004). Since it was determined that veterinarians are perceived to be the most reliable and trustworthy source of information by TSCRA members, local opinion leaders, such as veterinarians, should engage in train-the-trainer programs to ensure a consistent risk communication message is being disseminated...|$|R
