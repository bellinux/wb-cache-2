40|$|Vertical dust {{deposition}} rates (dust flux) are {{a complex}} {{response to the}} interaction of seasonal precipitation, wind, changes in plant cover and land use, dust source type, and local vs. distant dust emission in the southwestern U. S. Seasonal dust flux in the Mojave-southern Great Basin (MSGB) deserts, measured from 1999 to 2008, is similar in summer-fall and winter-spring, and antecedent precipitation tends to suppress dust flux in winter-spring. In contrast, dust flux in the eastern Colorado Plateau (ECP) region is much larger in summer-fall than in winter-spring, and {{twice as large as}} in the MSGB. ECP dust is related to wind speed, and in the winter-spring to antecedent moisture. Higher summer dust flux in the ECP is likely due to <b>gustier</b> winds and runoff during monsoonal storms when temperature is also higher. Source types in the MSGB and land use in the ECP have important effects on seasonal dust flux. In the MSGB, wet playas produce salt-rich dust during wetter seasons, whereas antecedent and current moisture suppress dust emission from alluvial and dry-playa sources during winter-spring. In the ECP under drought conditions, dust flux at a grazed-and-plowed site increased greatly, and also increased at three annualized, previously grazed sites. Dust fluxes remained relatively consistent at ungrazed and currently grazed sites that have maintained perennial vegetation cover. Under predicted scenarios of future climate change, these results suggest that an increase in summer storms may increase dust flux in both areas, but resultant effects will depend on source type, land use, and vegetation cover...|$|R
40|$|The United Arab Emirates is a {{new country}} that has had little time to {{accumulate}} a scientific heritage. Meteorologically researched and documented weather material for forecasters is virtually non-existent and that available is fragmented and anecdotal. The thesis tackles this problem by identifying weather phenomena significant to aviation in the Emirates and particularly at Abu Dhabi International Airport (ADIA). Mechanisms responsible for their development are described and applicable forecasting rules and principles are derived. Surface and upper air observation data at ADIA from 1983 to 2002 were analysed to identify the weather phenomena, their associated weather systems and for statistical analyses. When relevant, observation data at Al Ain was also used. Post-processed numerical weather prediction Global Forecast Service Eta model data are used and when and where possible radar and satellite imagery. A secondary aim is to provide information of the general seasonal climate. This was achieved {{by means of a}} literature study of the dominating weather systems and the presentation of surface and upper air mean circulation charts. Fog is the most important weather phenomenon and serious disrupter of aviation at ADIA throughout the year. It does not occur during Shamal conditions, but fog can form well inland {{on the edge of the}} Empty Quarter at the Liwa Oasis when the Shamal wind becomes light. Contrary to local belief, fog is unlikely to occur on two, or more, consecutive nights. The Shamal can last for several days and disrupt helicopter flights to the oil rigs, while anabatic and katabatic effects often make it <b>gustier</b> and stronger inland at Al Ain than ADIA. While dust storms occur in strong southerly winds off the desert, the Shamal can bring dust from further afield from the north as can the previously unreported Nashi wind. The sea breeze can extend about 150 km inland to Al Ain and the Liwa Oasis. Thunderstorms associated with winter upper air troughs from the west, are the main producers of rain, while occasional thunderstorms off the Hajar Mountains in the east bring some rain in summer. Tropical depressions are a rare event. Thesis (PhD) [...] University of Pretoria, 2010. Geography, Geoinformatics and MeteorologyPhDUnrestricte...|$|R
