25|$|Due to the {{thickness}} of the leather, the seams of these coats were all butt-jointed, with hidden or partially hidden stitches. Extant examples are lined, either with coarse linen or silk. Many high quality examples show apparent fastenings of gold or silver tape at the front, however, these were merely decorative, the real fastenings being hidden <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> attached {{to the inside of the}} join. The extant collection of buff coats preserved at Littlecote House dating to 1649-1660, contains examples with leather varying from 0.06 to 0.22 inches (1.5 to 5.5 millimeters) in thickness and entire coats weighing between 4lb 4oz and 7lb 8oz (1.9 to 3.4 kilograms).|$|E
40|$|An {{allegation}} {{of sexual assault}} was made in which a bra was torn off by the assailant causing extensive damage; however, {{it was observed that}} the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastening was still intact. It was felt that it was not possible for a garment to receive such damage without damage to the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastening, thus indicating that the complainant caused the damage to the bra herself to support a false allegation. Reconstruction experiments were conducted in which the conditions of the allegation were simulated utilizing a range of similar bras. Following the infliction of damage, the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastenings were examined. In eight of nine experiments, the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastening were intact, despite the application of enough force to cause separation of the bra cups in five of the experiments. This shows that bras may suffer extensive damage without damage to the <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> fastening...|$|R

500|$|Each cell {{consisted}} of a wooden dowel with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc wires. [...] The dowels were helically grooved like a screw thread to locate the wires precisely in position. [...] This enabled the copper and zinc wires to be placed very {{close to each other}} without coming into electrical contact. [...] Insulated wires could not be used as this would interfere with the operation of the electrolyte. [...] Copper wires were inserted into the ends of the dowels to which the copper and zinc windings were soldered. [...] These end wires were either attached to, or formed into, <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> for attaching to other cells. [...] This arrangement is depicted in figure 2. [...] These attachments provided the electrical connections as well as the mechanical linkages.Lardner, pp.288-289Moritz, p.97Pulvermacher, p.2 ...|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} {{views on}} the shapes and connectivity of atoms was that proposed by Leucippus, Democritus, and Epicurus who reasoned that the solidness of the material corresponded {{to the shape of}} the atoms involved. [...] Thus, iron atoms are solid and strong with hooks that lock them into a solid; water atoms are smooth and slippery; salt atoms, because of their taste, are sharp and pointed; and air atoms are light and whirling, pervading all other materials. [...] It was Democritus that was the main proponent of this view. [...] Using analogies based on the experiences of the senses, he gave a picture or an image of an atom in which atoms were distinguished from each other by their shape, their size, and the arrangement of their parts. [...] Moreover, connections were explained by material links in which single atoms were supplied with attachments: some with <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> others with balls and sockets (see diagram).|$|E
500|$|There {{was some}} {{controversy}} over Bird's endorsement {{of a machine}} invented by one I. L. Pulvermacher that became known as Pulvermacher's chain. [...] The main market for this device was the very quack practitioners that Bird so detested, but it did actually work as a generator. [...] Bird was given a sample of this machine in 1851 and was impressed enough to give Pulvermacher a testimonial stating that the machine was a useful source of electricity. [...] Bird thought {{that it could be}} used by physicians as a portable device. [...] Electrically, the machine worked like a voltaic pile, but was constructed differently. [...] It consisted of a number of wooden dowels, each with a bifilar winding of copper and zinc coils. [...] Each winding was connected to the next dowel by means of metal <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> which also provided the electrical connection. [...] The electrolyte was provided by soaking the dowels in vinegar.Lardner, pp. 288–289 ...|$|E
40|$|The base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> {{system is}} an {{attachment}} {{that is designed}} to be used on the lunar surface as an improved alternative to the common crane <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> system. The design proposed uses an omni-directional ball <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> base to overcome the design problems associated with a conventional crane <b>hook.</b> The base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> is not sensitive to cable twist which would render a robotic lunar crane useless since there is little atmospheric resistance to dampen the motion of an oscillating member. The symmetric characteristics of the ball <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> base eliminates manual placement of the ball hook into the base; commonly associated with the typical <b>hook</b> <b>and</b> <b>eye</b> stem. The major advantage of the base <b>and</b> ball <b>hook</b> system is it's ease of couple and uncouple modes that are advantages during unmanned robotic lunar missions...|$|R

Beecher {{patented}} his hook-and-eye in June 1900 {{with the}} U.S. Patent Office; in 1902, {{an updated version}} was submitted that consisted of an attachable hook-and-eye, without any stitching required.

2500|$|The gown {{was worn}} over a kirtle or {{petticoat}} (or both, for warmth). Prior to 1545, the kirtle {{consisted of a}} fitted one-piece garment. [...] After that date, either kirtles or petticoats might have attached bodices or bodies that fastened with lacing or <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes</b> and most had sleeves that were pinned or laced in place. The parts of the kirtle or petticoat that showed beneath the gown were usually made of richer fabrics, especially the front panel forepart of the skirts.|$|E
2500|$|Early in the decade, bodices {{of morning}} dresses {{featured}} panels {{over the shoulder}} that were gathered into a blunt point at the slightly dropped waist. [...] These bodices generally fastened in back by means of <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> but a new fashion for a [...] bodice appeared as well, buttoned in front and worn over a chemisette. [...] Wider bell-shaped or pagoda sleeves were worn over false undersleeves or engageantes of cotton or linen, trimmed in lace, broderie anglaise, or other fancy-work. Separate small collars of lace, tatting, or crochet-work were worn with morning dresses, sometimes with a ribbon bow.|$|E
2500|$|Elisabeth {{emphasised}} her extreme slenderness {{through the}} practice of [...] "tight-lacing". During the peak period of 1859–60, which coincided with Franz-Joseph's political and military defeats in Italy, her sexual withdrawal from her husband after three pregnancies in rapid succession, and her losing battle with her mother-in-law for dominance in rearing her children, she reduced her waist to 16inches in circumference. Corsets of the time were split-busk types, fastening up the front with <b>hooks</b> <b>and</b> <b>eyes,</b> but Elisabeth had more rigid, solid-front ones made in Paris out of leather, [...] "like those of Parisian courtesans", probably to hold up under the stress of such strenuous lacing, [...] "a proceeding which sometimes took quite an hour". The fact that [...] "she only wore them for a few weeks" [...] may indicate that even leather proved inadequate for her needs. Elisabeth's defiant flaunting of this exaggerated dimension angered her mother-in-law, who expected her to be pregnant continuously.|$|E
