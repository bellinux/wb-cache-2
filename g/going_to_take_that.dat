500|$|The writers {{felt that}} it would be more {{interesting}} if Reyes was given the Ghost Rider mantle physically rather than by making a deal [...] "with some disembodied spirit or something", and decided to tie in with an older idea associated with the comic character in which the mantle is passed from one version of the Ghost Rider to another. They decided to show another Ghost Rider arrive on a motorcycle and [...] "hand off" [...] the mantle to Robbie, which Bell said [...] "promised more story to come possibly, whether now or later. It also plugged into the larger universe." [...] The other Ghost Rider is not named and no actor is credited in the episode, with the character only referred to as a [...] "Good Samaritan" [...] by Gabe in the episode, but the producers hinted with the character's design and an Easter egg in the previous episode that this was the Johnny Blaze version. This was later confirmed by others involved with the episode, with Luna later attributing the lack of onscreen clarification to legal issues. The producers did not intend to explore Blaze beyond his brief appearance in the episode, but Bell did state that he was no longer the Ghost Rider after passing on the Spirit of Vengeance to Reyes, saying that [...] "there is a tradition within the comics that there's been many Ghost Riders and our take on that was they're not simultaneously a tribe of Ghost Riders but that it's passed ... That's as far as we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> part." ...|$|E
2500|$|Loeb confessed first. He {{asserted}} that Leopold had planned everything, and had killed Franks {{in the back}} seat of the car while he, Loeb, drove. Leopold's confession followed swiftly thereafter; but he insisted that he was the driver, and Loeb the murderer. [...] Their confessions otherwise corroborated most of the evidence in the case. Leopold later claimed, in his book (long after Loeb was dead), that he pleaded in vain with Loeb to admit to killing Franks. [...] "Mompsie feels less terrible than she might, thinking you did it," [...] he quotes Loeb as saying, [...] "and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>that</b> shred of comfort away from her." [...] While most observers believed that Loeb did indeed strike the fatal blows, [...] some circumstantial evidence—including testimony from eyewitness Carl Ulvigh, who said he saw Loeb driving and Leopold {{in the back seat}} minutes before the kidnapping—suggested that Leopold could have been the killer.|$|E

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Deutsche Welle on September 8, 2016, Gutierrez explained, [...] "If you don't regulate the immigration, if you don't structure our communities, we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do whatever we want.
