The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the utility of median nerve ultrasonography in the diagnosis of CTS in Iranian patients. Methods: Ninety patents with clinically suspected CTS were studied. Based on gold standard electromyography/nerve conduction velocity studies, wrists with CTS were divided into three groups on the basis of severity of CTS, ie, mild, moderate, and severe. In addition, both sides of the wrist were examined using sonography. Transverse images of the median nerve were obtained and median nerve cross-section areas were measured at three levels, ie, immediately proximal to the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> at the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> and at the carpal tunnel outlet. Furthermore, flexor retinaculum thickness was evaluated. Results: The mean age of the studied patients was 48. 52 &plusmn; 12. 17 years. Median values of the median nerve cross-section at the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> carpal <b>tunnel</b> outlet, and proximal carpal tunnel significantly differed between the wrists with and without CTS (P &lt; 0. 05). Comparisons between the CTS groups (mild, moderate, and severe) and non-CTS wrists demonstrated that the median cross-sections of median nerve at the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> carpal <b>tunnel</b> outlet, and <b>inlet</b> proximal carpal <b>tunnel</b> were significantly greater in the severe CTS group than in the other three groups (P &lt; 0. 05). The results showed that the median nerve cross-section at the three levels of carpal tunnel could only fairly differentiate severe CTS from other cases. Conclusion: The present study demonstrated that median nerve ultrasonography cannot replace the gold standard test (nerve conduction velocity) for the diagnosis of CTS because of low overall sensitivity and specificity, although it might provide useful information in some patients.

40|$|PURPOSE : To prospectively {{evaluate}} {{accuracy of}} sonography for diagnosis of {{carpal tunnel syndrome}} (CTS) in patients clinically suspected of having the disease in one or both hands. MATERIALS AND METHODS : A prospective cohort of 133 patients suspected of having CTS were referred to a teaching hospital between October 2001 and June 2002 for electrodiagnostic study. One hundred twenty patients (98 women, 22 men; mean age, 49 years; range, 19 – 83 years) underwent sonography within 1 week after electrodiagnostic study. Radiologist was blinded to electrodiagnostic study results. Seventy-five patients had bilateral symptoms; 23 patients, right-hand symptoms; and 22 patients, left-hand symptoms (total, 195 symptomatic hands). Cross-sectional area of median nerve was measured at three levels: immediately proximal to carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> at carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> and at carpal tunnel outlet. Flexor retinaculum {{was used as a}} landmark to margins of carpal tunnel. Optimal threshold levels (determined with classification and regression tree analysis) for areas proximal to and at <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> and at <b>tunnel</b> outlet were used to discriminate between patients with and patients without disease. Sensitivity, specificity, and false-positive and false-negative rates were derived on the basis of final diagnosis, which was determined with clinical history and electrodiagnostic study results as reference standard. RESULTS: For right hands, sonography had sensitivity of 94 % (66 of 70); specificity, 65 % (17 of 26); false-positive rate, 12 % (nine of 75); and false-negative rate, 19 % (four of 21) (cutoff, 0. 09 cm 2 proximal to <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> and 0. 12 cm 2 at tunnel outlet). For left hands, sensitivity was 83 % (53 of 64); specificity, 73 % (24 of 33); false-positive rate, 15 % (nine of 62); and false-negative rate, 31 % (11 of 35) (cutoff, 0. 10 cm 2 proximal to <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet).</b> CONCLUSION : Sonography is comparable to electrodiagnostic study in diagnosis of CTS and should be considered as initial test of choice for patients suspected of having CTS. <br /...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundThe {{residual}} laxity after transtibial posterior {{cruciate ligament}} (PCL) reconstruction has been reported by several authors. The sharp angle where the graft exits the tibial tunnel, which is known as “killer turn”, {{is believed to be}} the main reason. The purpose of this study was to reveal the mechanism of “killer turn” and its effect on both graft and <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet.</b> MethodsA total of 60 New Zealand white rabbits were included. All transtibial PCL reconstructions were performed in vitro using Achilles tendon autograft. The cyclic loading tests were conducted when reconstructed knees were subjected to 1500 cycles of tensile force of 50  N with the angle of pull at 45 ° to the tibial plateau. The <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> enlargement, graft elongation, stiffness, graft displacement, load to failure, and failure site were all recorded and analysed. ResultsFifty-eight New Zealand white rabbits were available for biomechanical evaluation. The subjects had significant graft elongation and tunnel enlargement. The graft displacement increased by a mean of 0. 92 ± 0. 36  mm (16. 70 %). At the 1500 th cycle, the grafts were significantly elongated by 5. 59 ± 4. 98 %, and the <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> diameter was also significantly enlarged by 12. 08 ± 4. 31 %. There was a linear correlation between total graft displacement and the two variables (R 2 = 0. 402, F= 18. 515, p< 0. 001). The coefficient for <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> enlargement was 0. 419 (p= 0. 006), and for graft elongation was 0. 583 (p= 0. 002). At the load-to-failure test, the failure load was 81. 19 ± 20. 13  N. Of the 58 grafts, 31 (53. 45 %) failed at the “killer turn”, 13 (22. 41 %) for the para-tunnel fracture, seven (12. 07 %) for the graft pull-out, and the remaining seven (12. 07 %) for the rupture at the mounting site.

Other programs included calculations of Over All Sound Pressure Level (OASPL), Effective Perceived Noise Level (EPNL). OASPL is the integration of sound with respect to frequency, and EPNL is weighted for a human s response to different sound frequencies and integrated with respect to time.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: A {{retrospective}} study {{to investigate the}} utility of ultrasonographic carpal tunnel outlet measurements in the diagnosis of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS). METHODS: 118 hands of 87 patients with electrophysiologically confirmed CTS and 44 control hands of 23 subjects were assessed. Cross-sectional areas (CSA) of the median nerve were measured at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet,</b> outlet, and forearm. Longitudinal diameters (LAPD) were measured at the <b>inlet,</b> proximal <b>tunnel,</b> distal tunnel, and outlet. RESULTS: CSA at the outlet (median: 18 mm 2) and its palm-to-forearm-ratio (median: 2. 7) were significantly larger than CSA at the inlet (median: 15 mm 2) and its wrist-to-forearm-ratio (median: 2. 2) (p< 0. 001). 27 % of the hands showed enlargement only at the outlet versus 13 % only at the inlet. LAPD jump was significantly greater, suggesting relief of higher pressure, at the outlet/distal tunnel versus inlet/proximal tunnel (p< 0. 001).

METHODS: A total of 88 consecutive patients with CTS (104 hands) underwent open surgical release of the median nerve. Ultrasound (US) examination was performed blind to any patient's data. The median nerve area at <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet, the retinaculum distance, and the flattening ratio were measured. The main outcome variable was the patient's overall satisfaction using a five-point Likert scale (1 = worse, 2 = no change, 3 = slightly better, 4 = much better, 5 = cured) at 3 months postoperatively. Pre- and postoperative ultrasonographic findings in relation to clinical outcome were analysed. RESULTS: Improvement (scores 4 or 5 on the Likert scale) was recorded in 75 hands (72 %). After carpal tunnel release, the cross-sectional area at <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> decreased from a mean of 14. 2 to 13. 3 mm 2 in the group with clinical improvement and also from a mean of 12. 5 to 11. 6 mm 2 in the group with no change or slight improvement.

30|$|The Cross-sectional area (CSA) of {{the median}} nerve was {{measured}} by continuous tracing a continuous line at the inner hyper-echoic rim of the median nerve at the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> (at {{the level of the}} pisiform and scaphoid bones) (Ziswiler et al. 2005; Klauser et al. 2009). Images were magnified in order to reduce measurement error. The CSA of the median nerve measured was recorded. Flattening ratio defined as the ratio of the major axis of the median nerve to its minor axis was calculated.|$|R
5000|$|The tunnel runs partly {{across a}} section of Water Authority land known as the Genesee Recreation area, located {{northwest}} of the intersection of Route 79 and Route 80, which is covered by 9 miles of hiking trails and {{is the site of}} the historic [...] "Little Genesee Settlement." [...] In this section there are two additional smaller <b>inlets</b> where the <b>tunnel</b> crosses beneath Dowd Hollow Brook and Iron Stream, consisting of simple iron grates covering pipes in which the ground water drains into the underground tunnel.|$|R
40|$|Attenuation {{properties}} of three treated fan <b>inlets</b> were evaluated. <b>Tunnel</b> flow simulated the inflow clean-up effect on source noise observed in flight and allowed {{observation of the}} blade passage frequency tone cut-off phenomenon. Acoustic data consisted of isolated inlet noise measured in the far field at two fixed positions and with traverses at four frequencies. Attenuation and source noise properties with and without flight simulation are compared and discussed. Averaged attenuation properties showed relative agreement of the inlets with their design intent, however, tunnel flow significantly affected the attenuation spectra...|$|R
40|$|The {{detailed}} aim of {{the study}} is to determine the distribution of flow velocity, turbulence, the frequency of detaching vortices. These parameters are measured for conductor installed in the wind tunnel and it models the overhead transmission line in wind flow conditions. Knowledge of these parameters are very important from the perspective of response of the conductor on wind load excitations generating the vibrations of the system and the results can be useful in the design process. Measurements are made for constant air velocity, fixed turbulence at the <b>inlet</b> of the <b>tunnel...</b>|$|R
40|$|An {{anechoic}} {{wind tunnel}} experiment {{was conducted to}} determine the effects of simulated flight on the noise characteristics of a high throat Mach number fan inlet. Comparisons were made with the performance of a conventional low throat Mach number inlet with the same 50. 8 cm fan noise source. Simulated forward velocity of 41 m/sec reduced perceived noise levels for both inlets, the largest effect being more than 3 db for the high throat Mach number inlet. The high throat Mach number inlet was as much as 7. 5 db quieter than the low throat Mach number <b>inlet</b> with <b>tunnel</b> airflow and about 6 db quieter without tunnel airflow. Effects of inlet flow angles up to 30 deg were seemingly irregular and difficult to characterize because of the complex flow fields and generally small noise variations. Some modifications of tones and directivity at blade passage harmonics resulting from inlet flow angle variation were noted...|$|R
40|$|Although {{ultrasound}} measurements {{have been}} used in previous studies on carpal tunnel syndrome to visualize injury to the median nerve, whether such ultrasound data can indicate the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome remains controversial. The cross-sectional areas of the median nerve at the <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> and outlet can show swelling and compression of the nerve at the carpal. We hypothesized that the ratio of the cross-sectional areas of the median nerve at the carpal <b>tunnel</b> <b>inlet</b> to outlet accurately reflects the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome. To test this, high-resolution ultrasound with a linear array transducer at 5 - 17 MHz was used to assess 77 patients with carpal tunnel syndrome. The results showed that the cut-off point for the inlet-to-outlet ratio was 1. 14. Significant differences in the inlet-to-outlet ratio were found among patients with mild, moderate, and severe carpal tunnel syndrome. The cut-off point in the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the median nerve was 1. 29 between mild and more severe (moderate and severe) carpal tunnel syndrome patients with 64. 7 % sensitivity and 72. 7 % specificity. The cut-off point in the ratio of cross-sectional areas of the median nerve was 1. 52 between the moderate and severe carpal tunnel syndrome patients with 80. 0 % sensitivity and 64. 7 % specificity. These results suggest that the inlet-to-outlet ratio reflected the severity of carpal tunnel syndrome...|$|R
