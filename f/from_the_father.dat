5|$|Saving Mr. Banks is a 2013 period drama film {{directed}} by John Lee Hancock from a screenplay written by Kelly Marcel and Sue Smith. Centered {{on the development}} of the 1964 film Mary Poppins, the film stars Emma Thompson as author P. L. Travers and Tom Hanks as filmmaker Walt Disney, with supporting performances by Paul Giamatti, Jason Schwartzman, Bradley Whitford, and Colin Farrell. Deriving its title <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> in Travers' story, Saving Mr. Banks depicts the author's fortnight-long meetings during 1961 in Los Angeles, during which Disney attempts to obtain the screen rights to her novels.|$|E

5|$|Giuseppe Elia Pace, an {{advocate}} and {{close friend of}} Mikiel Anton Vassalli, {{was found guilty of}} treason during the reign of de Rohan and was sentenced for flogging in Valletta followed by a permanent exile out of Malta. Vassalli was imprisoned at the Klistanija {{at the end of the}} rule of the Order of St. John, and was accused of plotting revolutionary ideas during the magistracy of Grand Master Hompesch. Vassalli denied the accusations and remained imprisoned. Meanwhile, he received visits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>father</b> of Fortunato Panzavecchia. While dining together around a table with prison guards, Panzavecchia took notes from conversations he had with Vassalli. These notes shed more light on the life of Vassalli, who after his death became the national Maltese linguistic. Though given a life sentence, he either managed to escape or was released after the expulsion of the Order from Malta.|$|E
5|$|The {{duplication}} {{and transmission}} of genetic material {{from one generation}} of cells to the next {{is the basis for}} molecular inheritance, and the link between the classical and molecular pictures of genes. Organisms inherit the characteristics of their parents because the cells of the offspring contain copies of the genes in their parents' cells. In asexually reproducing organisms, the offspring will be a genetic copy or clone of the parent organism. In sexually reproducing organisms, a specialized form of cell division called meiosis produces cells called gametes or germ cells that are haploid, or contain only one copy of each gene. The gametes produced by females are called eggs or ova, and those produced by males are called sperm. Two gametes fuse to form a diploid fertilized egg, a single cell that has two sets of genes, with one copy of each gene from the mother and one <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>father.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{results in}} Table  1 provide strong {{evidence}} of intergenerational transmission {{for each of}} these outcomes. In the case of fertility and labor supply, it shows the effect of mother’s source country fertility and labor supply to be generally larger than that of women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>father’s</b> source country—perhaps reflecting a gender roles effect. Conversely, the effect of the education of men <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>father’s</b> source country is larger than that of women <b>from</b> <b>the</b> mother’s source country—perhaps because it is <b>the</b> <b>father</b> who primarily determines the socio-economic status of the family. Interestingly, second-generation women’s schooling levels are negatively affected by immigrant mothers’ fertility, suggesting a quality-quantity tradeoff for immigrant families.|$|R

25|$|True {{scale of}} the problem became evident during the {{following}} years. The Frankish view of the Filioque was emphasized again in the Libri Carolini, composed around 791-793. Openly arguing that the word Filioque {{was part of the}} Creed of 381, the authors of Libri Carolini demonstrated not only the surprising lack of basic knowledge but also the lack of will to receive right advice and council from the Mother-Church in Rome. Frankish theologians reaffirmed the notion that the Spirit proceeds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> and the Son, and rejected as inadequate the teaching that the Spirit proceeds <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Father</b> through the Son. That claim was both erroneous and dangerous for the preservation of the unity of the Church.|$|E
