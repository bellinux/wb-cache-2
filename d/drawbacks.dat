5|$|Some <b>drawbacks</b> {{of using}} organoiodine {{compounds}} {{as compared to}} organochlorine or organobromine compounds is the greater expense and toxicity of the iodine derivatives, since iodine is expensive and organoiodine compounds are stronger alkylating agents. For example, iodoacetamide and iodoacetic acid denature proteins by irreversibly alkylating cysteine residues and preventing the reformation of disulfide linkages.|$|E

5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken intermittently and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other <b>drawbacks</b> of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E

Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass has noted his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's <b>drawbacks</b> is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E

Other devices such as rigid stylets, the lightwand (a blind technique) and indirect fiberoptic rigid stylets, such as the Bullard scope, Upsher scope and the WuScope can also be used as alternatives to direct laryngoscopy. Each of these devices have its own unique set of benefits and <b>drawbacks,</b> and none of them is effective under all circumstances.|$|E

The Leader was an attempt to extend the life of steam traction by eliminating many of the operational <b>drawbacks</b> associated with existing steam locomotives. It was intended as a replacement for the ageing fleet of M7 class tank engines still in operation on the Southern Railway (SR). Design work began in 1946 and development continued after the nationalisation of the railways in 1948, under the auspices of British Railways (BR).|$|E

5|$|The {{core of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is focused}} on stealth-based tactics, which require one to silently take out enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks.

The game takes place {{in a wide variety of}} locations, including narrow interior streets of Washington D.C. to wide open plains of Kazakhstan. In some stealth based missions, the game will involve various puzzles. Some locations feature low light ambience, which force the player to use their torch despite its <b>drawbacks</b> imposed during stealth missions.|$|E
5|$|The {{headgear}} of {{the typical}} Confederate Infantryman was the slouch hat, or the military Kepi. The Kepi is a short fatigue and dress cap that was easy to manufacture for the Army during the war. This type of hat had its <b>drawbacks,</b> however. It provided little weather protection, and was worn out easily {{after a few months}} of hard wear. The Infantryman design cap was sky-blue with a dark blue band, but this was rarely seen outside of officer private-purchase caps. More typical would be the plain gray/brown cap, with or without the branch of service trim. There are examples of deep-south made caps that were trimmed in red cotton and wool, and issued to Infantry units, showing that any available clothing was issued to the troops as the war progressed.|$|E
5|$|The rapid {{completion}} of the fort did have some <b>drawbacks,</b> however. The fort lacked some of the refinements that would be present at later forts like Fort Foote. In 1864, civil engineer William C.

There simply had not been time in 1861 to construct proper earthen magazines. This sort of constant renovation and improvement would continue throughout the war as forts were adapted to new purposes and new garrisons.|$|E

5|$|Tracheal {{intubation}} in {{the emergency}} setting can be difficult with the fiberoptic bronchoscope due to blood, vomit, or secretions in the airway and poor patient cooperation. Because of this, patients with massive facial injury, complete upper airway obstruction, severely diminished ventilation, or profuse upper airway bleeding are poor candidates for fiberoptic intubation. Fiberoptic intubation under general anesthesia typically requires two skilled individuals. Success rates of only 83–87% have been reported using fiberoptic techniques {{in the emergency}} department, with significant nasal bleeding occurring in up to 22% of patients. These <b>drawbacks</b> limit the use of fiberoptic bronchoscopy somewhat in urgent and emergency situations.|$|E
5|$|With {{the death}} of his last {{contemporary}} on the faculty in 1845, Tucker resigned his professorship and moved to Philadelphia, where he enjoyed the availability of more libraries, meetings at the American Philosophical Society and a reunion with his friend Robley Dunglison. Nevertheless, there were <b>drawbacks</b> – for one, the lack of accommodation that slaveholding had brought him—he had emancipated all five of his slaves upon his departure from Charlottesville. He later expressed doubt about the wisdom of the latter decision when he learned that three of them had, by law, been exiled from Virginia, and shortly thereafter died. As well, the two freed slaves who accompanied him to Philadelphia immediately deserted their posts upon arrival there.|$|E
