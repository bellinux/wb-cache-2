500|$|Producer {{and writer}} Chip Johannessen {{felt that the}} scene in this episode in which a human hair is {{discovered}} with a message inscribed upon it was a [...] "perfect" [...] moment, in that it [...] "told you everything about this guy ... but {{you had no idea}} what he was or what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next</b> ... you know what kind of crazy motherfucker would do that, but where he is or what he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next,</b> who knows". The episode's opening nightmare sequence, in which Jordan Black (Brittany Tiplady) is terrified by a clown crawling along the ceiling, was inspired by the childhood nightmares of Morgan and Wong, and left Tiplady suffering from bad dreams herself for several nights after filming. Producer John Peter Kousakis recalls having visited the episode's set late during production, having felt that make-up effects supervisor Toby Lindala had been doing [...] "fabulous" [...] work on the series' prosthetic body parts. Walking on set to find Lindala's recreation of a quartered corpse, Kousakis remarked [...] "we're doing something special here, but we're also doing something really outrageous". Lance Henriksen also found this scene too graphic to film all at once, taking time between shots to compose himself.|$|E
500|$|Todd VanDerWerff of Vox {{likewise}} {{praised the}} structure of the season, noting the recent absence of Ramsay Bolton as a positive, but continuing, [...] "Though it wasn't as good as the last two episodes, [...] "Blood of My Blood" [...] continued the general upswing in quality Game of Thrones season six has undergone." [...] VanDerWerff also wrote in his review, [...] ""Blood of My Blood" [...] is another exciting hour of television, even if it's a bit more piece move-y than, say, [...] "The Door". The revelations are milder, the characters mostly talk about what they're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next,</b> and the stories go from Point A to Point B, instead of Point X, Y, or Z. But there's still plenty going on that's worth checking out." [...] Comparing the episode to [...] "Book of the Stranger", Jeremy Egner of The New York Times said, [...] "The problem with emerging naked from a flaming temple is that it's hard to top. It's hard to top, that is, unless you happen to have a dragon with a flair for dramatic timing." ...|$|E

Although his torment has driven him insane, {{he explains that}} taking on Sam's pain has helped relieve some of his past burdens. He then explains what the Word of God is, but is unable to read it. Two angels from his former garrison arrive in pursuit of Kevin, a prophet who was awakened by the Word of God and drawn to it. The angel Hester tries to kill Castiel out of anger for his past actions, but she is instead killed by Meg. The other angel offers Castiel the chance to return to Heaven with him, but Castiel declines, explaining that he feels he no longer belongs there. The other angel then leaves, taking Kevin away to safety. Castiel comments to the Winchesters that he finds it amazing {{that he does not}} know what he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next,</b> and teleports away after giving them his blood.|$|E
500|$|November {{began with}} a home match against Manchester United. Going into the match, both clubs were level on points and goal difference, {{at the top of}} the league. In the 45th minute, Gallas {{inadvertently}} scored an own goal to give United the lead, before Fábregas equalised early in the second half. Cristiano Ronaldo scored what was thought to be the winning goal, eight minutes from the end, but Arsenal equalised for the second time in the match via Gallas. The draw pleased Wenger, who after the game noted his team were [...] "...still charge of the title race because we are top with a game in hand". A win against Reading at the Madjeski Stadium on 12 November 2007 brought about Arsenal's 1,000th Premier League goal, scored by Adebayor. Reading striker Dave Kitson afterwards praised Arsenal's performance and asserted they were [...] "the best team on the planet": [...] "The thing that amazes you most is they are not just passing to each other – they are passing so that person can run on to the ball and then his mind is already made up what he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next.</b> It is just magic, it is unbelievable." ...|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reported}} that 92% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, {{based on a}} sample of 154, with an average score of 8/10, with del Toro receiving widespread acclaim, and the consensus being [...] "Soderbergh successfully pulls off the highly ambitious Traffic, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." [...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, {{each with its own}} tense rhythm and explosive payoff". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next.</b> The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled".|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Greg Ryan, Keogh was [...] "unanimously {{regarded as}} the best back in the colony" [...] and also [...] "one of the most gifted, colourful and ultimately controversial figures of early New Zealand rugby." [...] While rugby writer Terry McLean wrote of Keogh in 1987 that he was [...] "one of those rare birds of rugby, the genuine 'freak'." [...] A correspondent for Christchurch paper The Sun, lamenting a perceived decline in back play, wrote in 1917 that Keogh [...] "was probably the greatest half-back the rugby world has ever produced. His success was due entirely to his versatility in methods. Neither opponents nor spectators {{knew what he was}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next.</b> He was the first player to bounce the ball on the head of an opponent on a line-out, catch it, and streak down the field. He was an adept in kneeing the ball over the head of an opposing player; he feinted, he hurdled, he kicked; his play was never the same two minutes together." [...] While a teammate of Keoghs from the Natives, George Williams, said in 1925 that he had never seen Keogh's equal. William McKenzie, known as [...] "Off-Side Mac", who played 20 matches for New Zealand in the 1890s, said of Keogh in 1910: [...] "Keogh is {{regarded as the}} trickiest and most brilliantly attacking back ever turned out of the New Zealand school." ...|$|E
500|$|On December 14, 2012, {{academic}} and writer Judith Reisman stated {{in a piece}} for WorldNetDaily that in her view Wales had received revenue from a website which dealt in pornography. Relatively soon after the article was published, Wales wrote to WorldNetDaily to object to this characterization: [...] "This is absolutely and categoricallly [...] false. I have never made any 'fortune', as a pornography trafficker or otherwise, and I have never been a 'pornography trafficker' at all. ... I demand an immediate edit to that story to remove the lie about me." [...] WorldNetDaily editor Joseph Farah personally replied to Wales to explain that Wikipedia's coverage {{of the history of}} Bomis acknowledged at the time that: [...] "Bomis ran a website called Bomis Premium at premium.bomis.com until 2005, offering customers access to premium, X-rated pornographic content." [...] Wales sent an email to Farah stating Wikipedia: [...] "doesn't say anything remotely like me making a 'fortune' from 'pornography." [...] Wales inquired to Farah what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next</b> about what Wales characterized as [...] "libel". Farah responded to Wales' reply with a subsequent email asking: [...] "Let me get this straight: You admit making money from pornography, but you feel defamed because you didn’t make enough for it to be considered a 'fortune'?" [...] Wales then repeated his original request to Farah and again asserted the original article was [...] "defamatory", writing in an email: [...] "This is a defamatory falsehood. I have never made any 'fortune' as a 'porngraphy [...] trafficker.' Fix it." ...|$|E

At 15:47:06, while climbing through , the crew requested clearance to proceed directly to waypoint [...] At 15:53, the crew reported reaching the cruise altitude of FL350 and was cleared to proceed directly to PARDI, and to report abeam Palembang. At 16:05, the cockpit voice recorder (CVR) ceased recording. The TV series Mayday argues Captain Tsu may have taken the opportunity of leaving the cockpit for tripping the CVR circuit breaker in order {{to turn off the}} CVR. At 16:10, the air traffic controller informed the flight that it was abeam Palembang and instructed the aircraft to maintain FL350 and to contact Singapore Control upon reaching PARDI. First Officer Ward acknowledged this call. At 16:11, nearly six minutes after the CVR ceased recording, the flight data recorder (FDR) also stopped recording. Mayday shows that Tsu is thought of as having likely came up with an excuse to get Duncan out of the cockpit. Once that was done, the pilot then proceeded to lock his own co-pilot out of the flight deck before disabling the data recorder; Ming is presumed to have done this {{in order to ensure that}} there would be no record of what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>next.</b>|$|E
