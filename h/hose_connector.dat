50|$|The dirt bag or {{collection}} bin {{in a central}} vacuum system is usually so large that emptying or changing {{needs to be done}} less often, perhaps a few times per year for an ordinary household. The central unit usually stays in stand-by, and is turned on by a switch on the handle of the hose. Alternately, the unit powers up when the hose is plugged into the wall inlet, when the metal <b>hose</b> <b>connector</b> makes contact with two prongs in the wall inlet and control current is transmitted through low voltage wires to the main unit.|$|E
5000|$|Inflator valve {{malfunction}} can {{inflate the}} bladder when the buoyancy is not needed, {{and if not}} recognized and dealt with promptly, can result in uncontrolled ascent with associated risk of decompression illness. This can happen more quickly with inflators combined with alternative demand valves as they must use a larger bore <b>hose</b> <b>connector.</b> However, the standard overpressure and dump valves provided are able to vent air faster than the inflator valve can fill the bladder. This can be mitigated by the ability to disconnect the inflator hose under pressure, a skill which is trained by some agencies.|$|E
50|$|Occasionally, the {{secondary}} second-stage {{is combined with}} the inflation and exhaust valve assembly of the buoyancy compensator device. This combination {{eliminates the need for}} a separate low pressure hose for the BC, though the low pressure <b>hose</b> <b>connector</b> for combined use must have a larger bore than for standard BC inflation hoses, because it will need to deliver a higher flow rate if it is used for breathing. This combination unit is carried in the position where the inflator unit would normally hang {{on the left side of}} the chest. With integrated DV/BC inflator designs, {{the secondary}} demand valve is at the end of the shorter BC inflation hose, and the donor must retain access to it for buoyancy control, so donation of the primary regulator to help another diver is essential with this configuration. The secondary demand valve is often partially yellow in color, and may use a yellow hose, for high visibility, and as an indication that it is an emergency or backup device. When a side-mount configuration is used, the usefulness of a secondary demand valve is greatly reduced, as each cylinder will have a regulator and the one not in use is available as a backup. This configuration also allows the entire cylinder to be handed off to the receiver, so a long hose is also less likely to be needed. Some diving instructors continue to teach buddy-breathing from a single demand valve as an obsolescent but still occasionally useful technique, learned in addition to the use of the backup DV, since availability of two second stages per diver is now assumed as standard in recreational scuba.|$|E
25|$|Various minor {{accessories}} {{are available}} to fit these <b>hose</b> <b>connectors.</b> These include interstage pressure gauges, which are used to troubleshoot and tune the regulator (not for use underwater), noisemakers, used to attract attention underwater and on the surface, and valves for inflating tires and inflatable boat floats, making the air in a scuba cylinder available for other purposes.|$|R
40|$|As a way {{to reduce}} water losses in furrow {{irrigation}} systems, used in fresh market tomato production, farmers are improperly distributing water into the field using plastic hose. The objective of this work was to study the suitability of using quick coupler sprinkler as <b>hose</b> <b>connectors</b> for water distribution in tomato plantation. The first step {{of the study was}} to assess the current hose field operation for tomato growers. Subsequently, four models of quick couplers sprinklers available in the market were tested in laboratory to determine the coefficient of resistance, the equivalent tube length, the head loss curve and the linking efficiency. As result, a structural design for <b>hose</b> <b>connectors</b> was presented using the model of coupling with the best hydraulic performance. Additionally, some technical recommendations on its use in irrigation water distribution are highlighted. Despite the requirement for additional field trials, the proposed system has potential to optimize the water use efficiency, to improve workers ergonomic conditions, and ensure good profitability to the producer...|$|R

The system is now universally used by gardeners throughout the world.|$|R
5000|$|Following the depressurization, {{the pilots}} {{did not receive}} {{supplemental}} oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation. The wreckage indicated that the oxygen bottle pressure regulator/shutoff valve was open on the accident flight. Further, although one flight crew mask <b>hose</b> <b>connector</b> {{was found in the}} wreckage disconnected from its valve receptacle (the other connector was not recovered), damage to the recovered connector and both receptacles was consistent with both flight crew masks having been connected to the airplane's oxygen supply lines at the time of impact. In addition, both flight crew mask microphones were found plugged into their respective crew microphone jacks. Therefore, assuming the oxygen bottle contained an adequate supply of oxygen, supplemental oxygen should have been available to both pilots' oxygen masks.A possible explanation for the failure of the pilots to receive emergency oxygen is that their ability to think and act decisively was impaired because of hypoxia before they could don their oxygen masks. No definitive evidence exists that indicates {{the rate at which the}} accident flight lost its cabin pressure; therefore, the Safety Board evaluated conditions of both rapid and gradual depressurization.If there had been a breach in the fuselage (even a small one that could not be visually detected by the in-flight observers) or a seal failure, the cabin could have depressurized gradually, rapidly, or even explosively. Research has shown that a period of as little as 8 seconds without supplemental oxygen following rapid depressurization to about [...] may cause a drop in oxygen saturation that can significantly impair cognitive functioning and increase the amount of time required to complete complex tasks.A more gradual decompression could have resulted from other possible causes, such as a smaller leak in the pressure vessel or a closed flow control valve. Safety Board testing determined that a closed flow control valve would cause complete depressurization to the airplane's flight altitude over a period of several minutes. However, without supplemental oxygen, substantial adverse effects on cognitive and motor skills would have been expected soon after the first clear indication of decompression (the cabin altitude warning), when the cabin altitude reached [...] (which could have occurred in about 30 seconds).Investigations of other accidents in which flight crews attempted to diagnose a pressurization problem or initiate emergency pressurization instead of immediately donning oxygen masks following a cabin altitude alert have revealed that, even with a relatively gradual rate of depressurization, pilots have rapidly lost cognitive or motor abilities to effectively troubleshoot the problem or don their masks shortly thereafter. In this accident, the flight crew's failure to obtain supplemental oxygen in time to avoid incapacitation could be explained by a delay in donning oxygen masks; of only a few seconds in the case of an explosive or rapid decompression, or a slightly longer delay in the case of a gradual decompression.In summary, the Safety Board was unable to determine why the flight crew could not, or did not, receive supplemental oxygen in sufficient time and/or adequate concentration to avoid hypoxia and incapacitation.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{commonly}} seen {{examples of}} hermaphroditic connectors include the SAE connector for 12 V DC power, jackhammer air <b>hose</b> <b>connectors,</b> and the Anderson Powerpole series of modular high-current power connectors.

50|$|Laboratory glassware, such as Buchner flasks and Liebig condensers, {{may have}} tubular glass tips serving as <b>hose</b> <b>connectors</b> with several ridged hose barbs around the {{diameter}} near the tip. This is {{so that the}} tips can have {{the end of a}} rubber or plastic tube mounted over them to connect the glassware to another system such as a vacuum, water supply, or drain. A special clip may be placed over the end of the flexible tube surrounding the connector tip to prevent the hose from slipping off the connector.|$|R
5000|$|... {{the use of}} quick-connector {{systems has}} become more popular. These are {{fittings}} that screw into the common <b>hose</b> <b>connectors,</b> allowing <b>hoses</b> and accessories to be easily connected together using a snap-fit system. The style manufactured by Gardena is common, imitated by and compatible with many other manufacturers. The connectors may also include an internal valve that is opened by the fitting, so that disconnecting a hose using this adaptor causes the water flow to stop. This greatly eases common tasks by allowing specialized sprayers to be interchanged without requiring two trips back to the spigot for each change.|$|R
40|$|Flexible water hoses (or {{flexible}} <b>hose</b> <b>connectors)</b> {{have become}} commonplace {{in recent years}} and provide a low-cost and convenient alternative to rigid pipe. Unfortunately, inadequate designs, particularly with regard to the selection of materials and material parameters, have made some hoses prone to failure. Such failures are often initiated by incidental exposure to corrosive substances commonly found in homes (including chlorides in tap water) that attack and corrode the stainless steel metal braid. A failure of the braid then leads to a rupture of the water-carrying tube. We evaluate the design considerations pertinent to flexible water hose failures and consider a recent failure scenario that illustrates some key points...|$|R

In other countries, a British Standard Pipe (BSP) thread is used, which is [...] inch and 14 TPI (male part outside diameter is 26.441 mm). The GHT and BSP standards are not compatible, and attempting to connect a GHT hose to a BSP fitting will damage the threads, and vice versa.|$|R

50|$|Once {{the engine}} had been started and the {{temperature}} had risen to the minimum operating level, the external air <b>hose</b> and <b>connectors</b> were removed and the engine's resonant design kept it firing without any further need for the electrical ignition system, which was used only to ignite the engine when starting.|$|R
50|$|Glad-hand {{connectors}} (also {{known as}} palm couplings) are air <b>hose</b> <b>connectors,</b> {{each of which}} has a flat engaging face and retaining tabs. The faces are placed together, and the units are rotated so that the tabs engage each other to hold the connectors together. This arrangement provides a secure connection, but allows the couplers to break away without damaging the equipment if they are pulled, as may happen when the tractor and trailer are separated without first uncoupling the air lines. These connectors are similar in design to the ones used for a similar purpose between railroad cars. Two air lines typically connect to the trailer unit. An emergency or main air supply line pressurizes the trailer's air tank and disengages the emergency brake, and a second service line controls the brake application during normal operation.|$|R
50|$|Three {{air nozzles}} {{in the front}} of the Argus As 014 were {{connected}} to an external high pressure source to start the engine. The fuel used for ignition was acetylene, with the technicians having to place a baffle of wood or cardboard in the exhaust pipe to stop the acetylene diffusing before complete ignition. Once the engine ignited and minimum operating temperature was attained, external <b>hoses</b> and <b>connectors</b> were removed.|$|R
50|$|The {{frame is}} {{designed}} to carry a cylinder on each side. The only restrictions on size are what the diver can carry, and the scrubber endurance.

50|$|Once {{the engine}} started and the {{temperature}} rose to the minimum operating level, the external air <b>hose</b> and <b>connectors</b> were removed, and the resonant design of the tailpipe kept the pulse jet firing. Each cycle or pulse of the engine began with the shutters open; fuel was injected behind them and ignited, and the resulting expansion of gases forced the shutters closed. As the pressure in the engine dropped following combustion, the shutters reopened and the cycle was repeated, roughly 40 to 45 times per second. The electrical ignition system was used only to start the engine; heating of the tailpipe skin maintained combustion.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Design and {{manufacturing}} methodologies for automotive pressure sensors to create robust sensors for this demanding environment. Material property selection and circuit design principles are covered. Cost sensitive designs {{that meet the}} range of automotive specifications and requirements are discussed. Analyzing defective units {{and manufacturing}} fallout {{as a tool to}} improving the design and manufacturing process. Among the more challenging tasks undertaken by sensor designers is the design and manufacture of reliable, robust piezoresistive sensors for the automotive market. Through years of trial and error, these designers have developed practices and techniques that have proven useful again and again for automotive applications. To enlighten and inform those who work with this technology (which addresses the leading volume user for piezoresistive sensors), the following discussion discloses several tricks of the trade. As a rule, 80 % of the final cost for a product is established in the first 20 % of the design effort. Thus, understanding the necessary design practices beforehand can minimize cost and improve your success in designing robust PRT pressure sensors for the demanding automotive environment. If you've never designed such sensors before, the first task is to open the hood of a recent-model vehicle (your own, perhaps) and have {{a good look at the}} engine compartment. That nest of wires, <b>hoses,</b> <b>connectors,</b> and engine is one of the most severe environments a sensor can have. Consider the thermal shock to an engine-mounted sensor operating above 100 °C and sprayed suddenly with slushy, salty water at 70 mph. Other properties of this environment are just as severe: Temperature: Vibration...|$|R

In the appliance sector, a dishwasher sump boot made with Santoprene TPV provided good sealing and resistance to heat and fluids. Due to its sealing properties, Santoprene TPV was also successful in the domestic and high-rise construction sectors in applications such as window seals, caster wheels, tubing and small <b>hose</b> parts, electrical <b>connectors</b> and coatings for wire and cables.

The objective of this work was to evaluate {{the performance of a}} system with emitter protection, and to compare the results with a system that uses a conventional emitter for subsurface {{drip irrigation}}. In the system with protection an inexpensive materials polyethylene <b>hose,</b> microtube, <b>connector,</b> and a dripper to control the flow rate were used; and, in the conventional system a commercial emitter was used. After 12 months of evaluation, the system with protector showed good performance, with relative average flow rate of 0. 97 and 0. 98 in pots with and without crop, respectively, showing no clogging problems and lower cost. In conventional system relative flow rate of 0. 51 and 0. 98 were observed in pots with and without crop, respectively, also clogging degree by roots of 49. 22 %, and emitters with soil inside was observed.

50|$|Ignition was {{initiated}} by an automotive-type spark plug located about 0.75 m behind the shutter system, electricity to the plug being supplied from a portable starting unit. Three air nozzles {{in the front}} of the pulse jet were connected to an external high pressure air source which was used to start the engine. Acetylene was used for starting, and very often a panel of wood or similar was held across the end of the tailpipe to prevent the fuel from diffusing and escaping before ignition was complete.Once the engine had been started and the temperature rose to the minimum operating level, the external air <b>hose</b> and <b>connectors</b> were removed and the resonant design of the tailpipe kept the pulse jet firing. Each cycle or pulse of the engine began with the shutters open; fuel was injected behind them and ignited, and the resulting expansion of gases forced the shutters closed. As the pressure in the engine dropped following combustion, the shutters reopened and the cycle was repeated, roughly 45 to 55 times per second. The electrical ignition system was needed only to start the engine - a V-1 carried no coils or magnetos to power the spark plug once launched.|$|R
30|$|Medical gas misconnections {{can have}} direct {{life-threatening}} effects. Thus, {{safe and secure}} medical gas supply systems are required {{to ensure the safety}} of clinical work. In the USA, the Diameter Index Safety System (DISS) has been widely used to avoid medical gas misconnections. In Japan, the pin-index medical gas pipeline system, which complies with the Japan Industrial Standard (JIS) (product standard number: JIS T 7101) [1], has been developed. This system is considered to be “foolproof” and is designed to prevent gas-specific hoses from being connected to the wrong outlet. Each of the sockets in the wall-mounted gas outlet system contains two or three gas-specific connector holes and is connected to a hose with two or three gas-specific pins. The gas specificity of the sockets is determined by the gas-specific central angles of the <b>hose</b> pins and <b>connector</b> holes. For example, the oxygen-specific pins and holes produce a central angle of 180 °, whereas the nitrous oxide-specific pins and holes exhibit a central angle of 135 °.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Long-term {{oxygen therapy}} (LTOT) {{is one of}} the main {{treatments}} for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients receiving LTOT may have less than optimal home conditions and this may interfere with treatment. The objective of this study was, through home visits, to identify the characteristics of patients receiving LTOT and to develop knowledge regarding the home environments of these patients. Methods: Ninety-seven patients with a mean age of 69 plus or minus 10. 5 years were evaluated. This study was a cross-sectional descriptive analysis. Data were collected during an initial home visit, using a questionnaire standardized for the study. The results were analyzed retrospectively. Results: Seventy-five percent of the patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 11 % were active smokers. The patients' mean pulse oximetry values were 85. 9 % plus or minus 4. 7 % on room air and 92 % plus or minus 3. 9 % on the prescribed flow of oxygen. Most of the patients did not use the treatment as prescribed and most used a humidifier. The extension hose had a mean length of 5 plus or minus 3. 9 m (range, 1. 5 - 16 m). In the year prior to the visit, 26 % of the patients received emergency medical care because of respiratory problems. Few patients reported engaging in leisure activities. Conclusion: The home visit allowed us to identify problems and interventions that could improve the way LTOT is used. The most common interventions related to smoking cessation, concentrator maintenance and cleaning, use of a humidifier, and adjustments of the length of the <b>connector</b> <b>hose.</b> Therefore, the home visit is a very important tool in providing comprehensive care to patients receiving LTOT, especially those who show lack of adequate progress and those who show uncertainty about the treatment method...|$|R
