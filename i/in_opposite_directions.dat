5|$|Ballistic {{annihilation}} {{describes a}} {{process by which}} moving particles and antiparticles annihilate each other when they collide. In the simplest version of this process, the system consists of a single type of particle and antiparticle, moving at equal speeds <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> in a one-dimensional medium.|$|E
5|$|This {{may also}} occur at sea between two {{different}} wave trains of near equal wavelength moving <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions,</b> but with unequal amplitudes. In partial clapotis the wave envelope contains some vertical motion at the nodes.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{chemical}} {{composition of the}} pentose residues of the bases, DNA strands have directionality. One end of a DNA polymer contains an exposed hydroxyl group on the deoxyribose; {{this is known as}} the 3'end of the molecule. The other end contains an exposed phosphate group; this is the 5'end. The two strands of a double-helix run <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> Nucleic acid synthesis, including DNA replication and transcription occurs in the 5'→3'direction, because new nucleotides are added via a dehydration reaction that uses the exposed 3'hydroxyl as a nucleophile.|$|E
5|$|On October 14, 2008, track {{inspector}} James Strickland {{was struck}} {{and killed by}} a train as he was walking along a section of track between the Concord and Pleasant Hill stations. Strickland's death started an investigation into BART's safety alert procedures. At {{the time of the}} accident, BART had assigned trains headed <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> to a shared track for routine maintenance. BART came under further fire in February 2009 for allegedly delaying payment of death benefits to Strickland's family.|$|E
5|$|The {{evidence}} {{collected during}} this investigation strongly supports {{the conclusion that}} this accident was caused by N600XL and GOL1907 following ATC clearances which directed them to operate <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> on the same airway at the same altitude resulting in a midair collision. The loss of effective air traffic control was {{not the result of}} a single error, but of a combination of numerous individual and institutional ATC factors, which reflected systemic shortcomings in emphasis on positive air traffic control concepts.|$|E

5|$|The two {{strands of}} DNA run <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> {{to each other}} and are thus antiparallel. Attached to each sugar is one of four types of {{nucleobases}} (informally, bases). It is the sequence of these four nucleobases along the backbone that encodes biological information. RNA strands are created using DNA strands as a template in a process called transcription. Under the genetic code, these RNA strands are translated to specify the sequence of amino acids within proteins in a process called translation.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize their reproductive fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> at individual and group levels.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} experiment {{carried out}} by Wu was the confirmation of the E. M. L. Pryce and John Clive Ward's calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> This was the first experimental confirmation of quantum results relevant {{to a pair of}} entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox. Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E

5|$|Another torque is {{produced}} by the finite width of the contact patch and the lean of the tire in a turn. The portion of the contact patch towards {{the outside of the}} turn is actually moving rearward, with respect to the wheel's hub, faster {{than the rest of the}} contact patch, because of its greater radius from the hub. By the same reasoning, the inner portion is moving rearward more slowly. So the outer and inner portions of the contact patch slip on the pavement <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions,</b> generating a torque that tends to turn the front wheel in the direction of the turn, and therefore tends to decrease the turn radius.|$|E
5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant to show any surface details.|$|E
5|$|Ørsted did {{not fully}} {{understand}} his discovery, but he observed the effect was reciprocal: a current exerts a force on a magnet, and a magnetic field exerts a force on a current. The phenomenon was further investigated by Ampère, who discovered that two parallel current-carrying wires exerted a force upon each other: two wires conducting currents {{in the same direction}} are attracted to each other, while wires containing currents <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> are forced apart. The interaction is mediated by the magnetic field each current produces and forms the basis for the international definition of the ampere.|$|E

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving boundary between two different air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. They tend to remain in the same area for long periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherms. A wide variety of weather can be found along a {{stationary front}}, but usually clouds and prolonged precipitation are found there. Stationary fronts will either dissipate after several days or devolve into shear lines, but can change into a cold or warm front if conditions aloft change causing a driving of one air mass or the other. Stationary fronts are marked on weather maps with alternating red half-circles and blue spikes pointing <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions,</b> indicating no significant movement.|$|E
5|$|Jarasandha is the nemesis of Krishna. No {{one other}} than Bheema {{or the other}} three {{mentioned}} earlier can defeat him, and the legend is that Krishna escapes to Dwaraka due to threats from Jarasandha, and his repeated failures in defeating the latter. This time Bheema and Krishna go in disguised form, as Brahmins(purohits) into the fortress of Jarasandha. There they request for a duel from Jarasandha. Jarasandha chooses Bheema as his sparring partner. During the fight, Krishna signals Bheema to tear Jarasandha vertically apart into two pieces so the latter will be killed for good. However the body parts of Jarasandha rejoin because of a boon he possesses, and he regains his life. After a few failed attempts, Krishna signals Bheema to throw apart Jarasandha's torn body parts <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> This time however Jarasandha dies.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 1940, {{three weeks}} after commissioning, Bismarck left Hamburg to begin sea trials in Kiel Bay. Sperrbrecher 13 escorted the ship to Arcona on 28 September, {{and then on to}} Gotenhafen for trials in the Gulf of Danzig. The ship's power-plant was given a {{thorough}} workout; Bismarck made measured-mile and high speed runs. As the ship's stability and manoeuvrability were being tested, a flaw in her design was discovered. When attempting to steer the ship solely through altering propeller revolutions, the crew learned that Bismarck could be kept on course only with great difficulty. Even with the outboard screws running at full power <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions,</b> they generated only a slight turning ability. Bismarcks main battery guns were first test-fired in late November. The tests proved she was a very stable gun platform. Trials lasted until December; Bismarck returned to Hamburg, arriving on 9 December, for minor alterations and the completion of the fitting-out process.|$|E

5|$|The Uue–Au bond {{should be}} the weakest of all bonds between gold and an alkali metal, but should still be stable. This gives {{extrapolated}} medium-sized adsorption enthalpies (−ΔHads) of 106kJ·mol−1 on gold (the francium value should be 136kJ·mol−1), 76kJ·mol−1 on platinum, and 63kJ·mol−1 on silver, the smallest of all the alkali metals, that demonstrate {{that it would be}} feasible to study the chromatographic adsorption of ununennium onto surfaces made of noble metals. The enthalpy of adsorption of ununennium on a Teflon surface is predicted to be 17.6kJ·mol−1, which would be the lowest among the alkali metals: this information would be very useful for future chemistry experiments on ununennium. The ΔHsub and −ΔHads values are not proportionally related for the alkali metals, as they change <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> as atomic number increases.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000–1,200rpm <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was designed to protect the gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E
5|$|Female-female {{aggression}}, {{which is}} fairly rare in other marine vertebrates, is common among loggerheads. Ritualized aggression escalates from passive threat displays to combat. This conflict primarily occurs over access to feeding grounds. Escalation typically follows four steps. First, initial contact is stimulated by visual or tactile cues. Second, confrontation occurs, beginning with passive confrontations characterized by wide head-tail circling. They begin aggressive confrontation when one turtle ceases to circle and directly faces the other. Third, sparring occurs with turtles snapping at each other’s jaws. The final stage, separation, is either mutual, with both turtles swimming away <b>in</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions,</b> or involves chasing {{one out of}} the immediate vicinity. Escalation is determined by several factors, including hormone levels, energy expenditure, expected outcome, and importance of location. At all stages, an upright tail shows willingness to escalate, while a curled tail shows willingness to submit. Because higher aggression is metabolically costly and potentially debilitating, contact is much more likely to escalate when the conflict is over access to good foraging grounds. Further aggression has also been reported in captive loggerheads. The turtles are seemingly territorial, and will fight with other loggerheads and sea turtles of different species.|$|E
