40|$|One of the {{important}} parameters observed during <b>extruded</b> <b>fibre</b> fabrication is its diameter. The diameter can be measured with a single scanning camera assuming that the fibre section has a circular shape. As proved in practice, another important parameter is ovality, that is the rate of fibre flattening. This paper assumes that the fibre section shape is elliptical. In such a case, at least three different views on examined fibre are needed. This paper deals with analytical description of fibre ovality measurement using two different approaches based {{on the principles of}} linear algebra and projective geometry. As a result, a considerable part of the work is devoted to these branches of mathematics with particular regard to analytical conics theory. Additionally, the work contains a brief mention of technical realization of ovality measurement and its possible difficulties...|$|E
40|$|Finite Element (FE) {{modelling}} is used {{to determine}} the effect of fibre volume fraction, aspect ratio and polymer matrix stiffness on the d(33) coefficients of 1 - 3 connectivity piezoelectric fibre composites. The aim is to use these observations as a means of determining the d(33) of fine scale lead zirconate titanate (PZT) fibres. Results from a I-D analytical model fit well with FE predictions for low aspect ratios. Two commercially available PZT- 5 A fibres, produced via the viscous suspension spinning process (VSSP) and an extrusion process, were fabricated into 1 - 3 composites with varying fibre volume fi-actions. The composite d(33) measurements are compared to the model predictions and {{used to determine the}} d(33) coefficients of the fibers. The d(33) of the VSSP <b>fibres</b> and <b>extruded</b> <b>fibres</b> is measured as 365 pCN(- 1) and 235 pCN(- 1) respectively using this method. The large difference in the piezoelectric coefficients is possibly linked to the grain size and porosity, which is examined using scanning electron microscopy...|$|R
40|$|Commercially {{available}} PZT- 5 A composition fibres fabricated using four production {{methods were}} incorporated into 1 - 3 composites with fibre volume fractions ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 72. Measurements of the piezoelectric induced strain constants (d(33) and d(31)), relative dielectric constants (epsilon(33)), longitudinal coupling factors (k(33)) and stiffness' (s(33)) of the varying volume fraction composites are compared to analytical expressions in order to extract the fibre properties. Results show 1 - 3 composite data accurately follows the analytical trends. The Viscous Plastic Process (VPP) fibres are found to exhibit optimum material properties, which approach bulk material values. Reduced piezoelectric activity in <b>extruded</b> <b>fibres</b> {{is thought to be}} associated with a small grain size and high porosity. A second study, an optimisation of interdigitated electrode design, was performed using the finite element software ANSYS. The effect of the IDE geometry (electrode width and spacing) and PZT substrate thickness on the strain output of bulk PZT substrates was modelled. Results show optimal actuation occurs at electrode widths equal to half the substrate thickness, and for thin substrates the electrode finger spacing can be reduced to enable lower driving voltages...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{strain and}} polarisation responses of 1 - 3 composites, which {{are related to}} the fibre and matrix properties. The validity of equations that predict the strain and polarisation of fibres from composite responses, and associated errors at high electric driving fields, are discussed. Surface profile measurements of single PZT rods in a polymer matrix, subjected to a static voltage, were made to investigate the effect of fibre aspect (diameter to length) ratio. Surface profiles, which show the active PZT rod extending from the passive polymer matrix, agree well with predictions made using finite element analysis. The results show that for a 1 - 3 composite to be treated as a homogeneous medium the fibre aspect ratio needs to be low. Commercially available PZT- 5 A composition fibres fabricated using four production methods were incorporated into 1 - 3 composites with fibre volume fractions ranging from 0. 02 to 0. 72, and with various aspect ratios, were evaluated. Strain-field and polarisation-field curves for the composites were obtained by testing the composites under electrical field cycles of +/- 2 kVmm(- 1). From these curves the strain and polarisation response of the fibres have been extracted using appropriate analytical equations. The saturation strain, saturation polarisation and coercive field values are reported for the four fibre types. The Viscous Plastic Process (VPP) and Viscous Suspension Spun (VSSP) fibres develop strains of approximately 4000 ppm. Reduced piezoelectric activity is seen in <b>extruded</b> <b>fibres,</b> which develop strains of 3000 ppm...|$|R

X-ray diffraction of the <b>extruded</b> and sintered <b>fibres</b> indicated some lead loss during sintering; however, the fibres exhibited low porosity (1. 54 %), high maximum piezoelectric strain (4041 ppm) and relatively low coercive field (0. 77 kV/mm).

40|$|<b>Extruded</b> {{collagen}} <b>fibres</b> {{have been}} shown to constitute a biomimetic three-dimensional scaffold with numerous tissue engineering applications. The multi-step fabrication process of this material provides opportunities for further advancements to improve the properties of the final product. Herein we investigated the influence of the post-self-assembly washing baths on the structural, mechanical and thermal properties of these fibres. The surface morphology and the inter-fibre packing were similar for every treatment. The overnight incubation in isopropanol yielded fibres with the highest temperature and energy of denaturation (p < 0. 013). Typical s- and j-shape stress–strain curves were obtained for all treatments in the dry and wet state respectively. Rehydration of the fibres resulted in increased fibre diameter (p < 0. 006) and reduced stress (p < 0. 001), force (p < 0. 001) and modulus (p < 0. 002) values for every treatment. In the dry state, the alcohol-treated fibres were characterized by the highest stress (p < 0. 002) values; whilst in the wet state the Tris–HCl-treated fibres were the weakest (p < 0. 006). For every treatment, in both dry and wet state, a strong and inverse relationship between the fibre diameter and the stress at break was observed. Overall, the fibres produced were characterized by properties similar to those of native tissues...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Blends of {{polypropylene}} with multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNT) {{have been prepared}} and melt spun to fibre filaments. The resulted filaments have been characterised regarding conductivity, thermal properties, and morphology. DSC suggests that carbon nanotubes act as nucleating sites in polypropylene and the TGA shows a high increase in thermal stability. Conductivity around 0. 001 S/cm are achieved for both as-spun fibre and drawn fibre. A higher load of CNT up to 15 wt % increases the conductivity to 2. 8 S/cm in as-spun fibre, but due to a high fibre diameter variation during spinning resulting in fibre breakage, melt spinning is very difficult. This {{is due to a}} non-uniform stress distribution during the drawing steps which can be a result of a non-homogeneous PP-CNT blend and the spinning machine process limitations. Differences in conductivities for <b>extruded</b> rods, as-spun <b>fibre</b> and drawn fibre which are made from the same blends, suggests that the crystallinity can affect the conductivity of the PP/CNT fibre...|$|R

Nowadays snacks and convenience foods are also consumed regularly in India. Properly designed convenience foods can make an important contribution to nutrition in societies where social changes are altering traditional patterns of food preparation. Extrusion cooking as a popular means of preparing snack foods based on cereals and plant protein foodstuff has elicited considerable interest and attention over the past 30 years. Several studies on the extrusion of cereals and pulses, using various proportions, have been conducted because blends of cereals and pulses produce protein enriched products.

40|$|This work proposes {{biodegradable}} textile-based {{structures for}} tissue engineering applications. We describe {{the use of}} two polymers, polybutylene succinate (PBS) proposed as a viable multifilamentand silk fibroin (SF), to produce fibre-based finely tuned porous architectures by weft knitting. PBS is here proposed as a viable <b>extruded</b> multifilament <b>fibre</b> to be processed by a textile-based technology. A comparative study was undertaken using a SF fibre with a similar linear density. The knitted constructs obtained are {{described in terms of}} their morphology, mechanical properties, swelling capability, degradation behaviour and cytotoxicity. The weft knitting technology used offers superior control over the scaffold design (e. g. size, shape, porosity and fibre alignment), manufacturing and reproducibility. The presented fibres allow the processing of a very reproducible intra-architectural scaffold geometry which is fully interconnected, thus providing a high surface area for cell attachment and tissue in-growth. The two types of polymer fibre allow the generation of constructs with distinct characteristics in terms of the surface physico-chemistry, mechanical performance and degradation capability, which has an impact on the resulting cell behaviour at the surface of the respective biotextiles. Preliminary cytotoxicity screening showed that both materials can support cell adhesion and proliferation. These results constitute a first validation of the two biotextiles as viable matrices for tissue engineering prior to the development of more complex systems. Given the processing efficacy and versatility of the knitting technology and the interesting structural and surface properties of the proposed polymer fibres it is foreseen that the developed systems could be attractive for the functional engineering of tissues such as skin, ligament, bone or cartilage.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this thesis is {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the microstructure and texture evolution during extrusion of AlMgSi alloys. The textures and microstructures in AA 6082 were analysed after extrusion into a flat profile, after extrusion into a cylindrical rod, after subsequent cold rolling of the extruded rod material and after annealing of the rolled material. The textures and microstructures of AA 6060 were analysed after extrusion of a cylindrical rod, after subsequent cold rolling and after annealing of the rolled material. The microstructures and textures of these samples was investigated by EBSD in a SEM and by XRD. The AA 6060 <b>extruded</b> round <b>fibre</b> had a recrystallised microstructure where the texture consisted of 100 -fibre coupled with a random texture. AA 6082 extruded rod contains dispersoids which hinders recrystallisation. Thus the microstructure is a non-recrystallised microstructure consisting of 0. 5 100 -fibre and 0. 43 111 -fibre. Texture simulations were mainly carried out using VPSC. The parameters varied in these simulation were slip planes activated durin deformation, strain rate sensitivity and interaction scheme. The deformation modes used during the simulations were uni-axial tensile deformation (Carried out using a random texture as input texture) and plane strain deformation (Carried out using 100 -fibre and 111 -fibre as input texture). Texture simulation were also done using ALAMEL model (and modifications of it). These simulations were carried out using the same deformations coupled with the same input textures as the VPSC simulations. These simulations were partly done to find what effect the different simulation parameters have on the end texture. They were also done to find how one can get the textures observed experimentally in aluminium. The main findings were that inclusion of the 112 110 slip system in texture simulations gives a texture closer to the experimental observed texture when the deformation mode where uniaxial deformation. It was not posible to find simulations parameters, using strain rate deformation, which gave texture close to the experimental observed texture...|$|R
40|$|Peripheral nerve {{injuries}} {{are a major}} clinical problem which currently affect over one million people worldwide. Transection injuries caused by workplace and home injuries, road traffic accidents and by intentional harm lead to debilitating and painful injuries for those afflicted. Treatments are limited and largely ineffective. The patient 2 ̆ 7 s own donor nerve (autograft) is {{the gold standard for}} repair but this treatment is largely unsuccessful, suffering from limited supply with donor site morbidity and pain. The use of hollow nerve guidance conduits (NGCs) is the current clinically approved alternative. However these have shown limited applicability in the clinic. Thus, the objective of this thesis was to improve and understand the use of these hollow NGCs and attempt to improve functional nerve regeneration using the concept of intraluminal guidance. Intraluminal guidance involves the incorporation of biomaterial structures (in this instance <b>extruded</b> collagen <b>fibres)</b> to replace the natural fibrin cable which forms during repair and guide regenerating axons to their distal targets. An intraluminal collagen fibre conduit was tested across both a non-critical (10 mm) and critical nerve gap (15 mm) in a rat sciatic nerve model for its ability to promote repair. Through sequential studies, it was shown that the incorporation of intraluminal structure reduced the misdirection of regenerating axons during repair and also achieved functional regeneration in a number of parameters {{similar to that of the}} gold standard. Additionally, the intraluminal fibre conduit demonstrated the ability to regenerate across, the aforementioned, critical nerve gap (a nerve gap where regeneration is minimal if not absent). Based on these results, a further understanding of the early molecular mechanisms resulting in these beneficial effects was warranted. Using proteomics analysis the effect of the biomaterial used, the incorporation of intraluminal structure and the influence of increasing gap distance were documented. From this understanding, the key molecular components governing the increased nerve regeneration seen in the intraluminal fibre conduit and the robust regeneration seen within autograft were revealed. Based on the conclusions of this study, an intraluminal fibre conduit or a hollow biomaterial conduit may be further functionalised to match the molecular profile of the gold standard for repair...|$|R
40|$|Structural characterisations of {{materials}} {{belong to the}} primary interests of basic and applied research, since they provide insights into the interactions of molecules and atoms, establish correlations with desired properties and point towards improving materials. One of the widely used tools for such structural investigation is X-ray diffraction. Its discovery nearly a century ago opened up a new era for visualising the internal nanostructures of different materials in both two and three dimensions and revolutionised our understanding to different materials properties. In this thesis, results of fibre diffraction studies by different X-ray based techniques, combined with some computer-aided modelling, on variety of synthetic and natural polymeric fibres comprising high performance, natural organics and semiconducting liquid-crystalline fibres, are presented and their potentials and results in structure determination are discussed. Fibres are ubiquitous in everyday life and {{a wide variety of}} objects which we are everyday in contact with them such as clothes, wooden chairs, high performance tires, sailing ropes, etc are consisted of fibres. It is well know that the properties and functions of many polymeric fibres at real working conditions are often strongly related to their structure at the micro- and nano level. Therefore, understanding the molecular packing/arrangement of these nanostructures, their orientation, size, shape, and their response to the applied external strain is important for understanding the performance of the fibres in new and challenging technological applications. In this thesis using different X-ray phase contrast imaging techniques, namely Talbot grating-based imaging and Coherent Diffractive Imaging (CDI) of Ptychography the effect of humidity on a piece of cotton fabric and single silk and wool fibres has been investigated at different length scales, respectively. In ptychography experiment, we resolve internal and surface nanostructures of both silk and wool fibres in 3 D. In addition, we show quantitative detailed information about the spatial density variations in the form of detailed maps of the size, shape and orientation distributions of the nanopores inside the silk fibre at both dry and humid conditions. We found that for both silk and wool, fibres swell anisotropically in humid conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first in situ experiment performed with this nano imaging tool. We also have used another phase imaging technique, namely Talbot grating-based imaging, to investigate the applicability of Talbot imaging for studying humidity transport in a piece of weaved cotton fabric, with a resolution much lower in the ptychography experiment, in the micrometer range. We have shown that with having access to three different image modalities from this technique, namely absorption-, phase- and dark-field images, this technique is a suitable non-destructive tool for tracking (studying) the dewetting process in the weakly scattering materials at different in situ conditions and act as a complementary techniques to the ptychography imaging technique in term of allowing to image a bigger sample (i. e. larger field of view). We found that in the dry and wet situations, the dark-field and phase images respectively give the “best” image in terms of resolving many micron-sized details in the sample. In addition, results of Small-Angle X-ray Scattering (SAXS) experiment on a set of high performance fibres (PPTA) under axially compressive and tensile strain have been presented and discussed. The strain values both in heat treated and as-spun Twarons have been calculated using elestica loop method and a two dimensional heuristic function for fitting the 2 D scattering patterns of them has been used. We show that exerted tensile and compressive strain affect the nanostructures of these fibres. In fact, when exceeding a certain amount of strain, irreversible destruction of the original nanostructure takes place, leading to qualitative changes of the SAXS pattern. Finally, the molecular packing, arrangements, orientations and interatomic distances of two sets of slightly different semiconducting liquid-crystalline <b>extruded</b> <b>fibres</b> have been obtained using Wide-Angle X-ray Scattering (WAXS) and scanning WAXS techniques. Particularly for the F 8 TBT polymeric fibre, structural data are provided for the first time, and information about the nearest-neighbour packing distances and coherence length of this macromolecule has been provided. For the second set of samples in this category, three discotic columnar hydrazone based fibres with six, eight and ten carbons of achiral alkoxy chains attached to their outer peripheries has been investigated using a multi-technique strategy combining mainly WAXS and Solid-State Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (SSNMR) and detailed information about the columnar structures, their unit cell type and dimensions has been deduced. In this study, {{for the first time the}} co-existence of two different packing morphologies in a columnar compound has been reported. I expect that the result of this PhD study will make some of structural and physical properties of these functional materials and their dependence to the different humidity levels more clear, thus providing information that leads to improved understanding and subsequently better fibre based products.

Advancements in bioengineering have enabled {{the development of}} various scaffold fabrication technologies, using natural or synthetic in origin polymers that closely imitate the native tendon anisotropic architecture. Anisotropic collagen sponges, <b>extruded</b> collagen <b>fibres,</b> isoelectric focused collagen fibres, electro-spun polymeric fibres and imprinted polymeric substrates are {{at the forefront of}} scientific and technological research and innovation. Herein, we ventured to assess whether onestep functionalisation of electro-spun fibres with nano / micro particles is possible and whether anisotropic imprinted substrates can maintain tenogenic phenotype in vitro and promote functional neotissue formation in vivo. Starting with electro-spinning, mechanical evaluation demonstrated that aligned orientated electro-spun fibres exhibited significant higher stress at break values than their random aligned counterparts and random orientated electro-spun fibres exhibited significant higher strain at break values than the aligned orientated scaffolds. While maintaining fibre structure, a co-deposition method of spraying and electro-spinning was developed that enabled the incorporation of microspheres within the threedimensional structure of the scaffold. Of significant importance is that bovine tenocytes aligned perpendicular to the fibre orientation, possibly due to the absence of mechanical tension. With respect to imprinting, it is still unclear whether surface topography can be translated into a clinically functional response in vivo at the tissue / device interface. Herein, we demonstrated that anisotropic substrates with groove depth of ~ 317 nm and ~ 1988 nm promoted human tenocyte alignment parallel to underlined topography XVII in vitro. However, none of the topographies assessed (~ 37 nm, ~ 317 nm and ~ 1988 nm groove depth) induced parallel to the substrate cellular orientation in a subcutaneous model and none of the topographies promoted directional tenogenesis in vivo. Further, the rigid poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) substrate used induced transdifferentiation towards chondrogenic / osteogenic lineage, as evidenced by gene analysis. Collectively, these data indicate that two-dimensional imprinting technologies are useful tools for in vitro cell phenotype maintenance, rather than for directional neotissue formation, should multifactorial approaches that consider both surface topography and substrate rigidity are established. Overall, both electro-spinning and imprinting technologies show great promise for tendon repair and regeneration. Imprinting could be the ideal technology for cell phenotype maintenance in vitro, as we can closely control architectural features. Although it was not investigated here, electro-spinning is the ideal technology for in vivo positive outcomes, as the three-dimensional architecture would allow directional tissue formation within the fibrous construct...|$|R
