40|$|Fabric-evoked prickle is an {{unpleasant}} sensation which is sometimes linked to wool-containing fabrics in next-to-skin applications.

However, {{it has not been}} verified whether or not this same finish might also act as an antibacterial agent. Therefore, this study investigated the hypothesis that permanent press finishes might stop or curtail bacterial growth on fabrics. Inoculations of two bacteria, E. Coli and B. mega on finished and unfinished fabric samples provided results for a comparative study. Some samples were inoculated and plated immediately; others were inoculated and kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours before plating to simulate storage and climatic conditions; and a third group were inoculated, kept in a humidity chamber for twenty-four hours and then laundered in and according to suggested Launderometer standards. The samples from this last test were then either plated whole or macerated and plated. The Agar Plate Test method (AATCC test standard for detection and evaluation of antibacterial finishes) and the Streak Test method were used for another set of tests. Another segment of the study concerned naturally soiled finished and unfinished fabrics. Small samples of each fabric were sewn in regular clothing, worn one day, and then plated. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and subsequently plated showed little or no growth whereas all the unfinished samples showed considerably increased growth. The permanent press samples that were inoculated and stored for twenty-four hours in a humidity chamber before plating showed no growth while the unfinished samples all exhibited bacterial growth. Of the samples that were inoculated, stored for twenty-four hours in the humidity chamber, washed, and plated whole, all finished samples had no growth but all untreated samples showed growth. Of the washed samples that were macerated, the untreated macerated fibers showed from five to six times more growth than the permanent press samples. The Agar Plate Test and Streak Test both showed that the permanent press samples inhibited bacterial growth whereas the unfinished samples showed no inhibition of growth. On all samples of naturally soiled permanent <b>press</b> <b>fabrics,</b> the majority of samples containing bacterial growth had less growth than the unfinished samples. These results would indicate that the permanent press finish can inhibit some bacterial growth and thus may act concomitantly as an antibacterial finish...|$|R

Easy and rapid processing capability, high impact and delamination resistance, low moisture absorption and infinite shelf {{life of the}} raw materials are the attractive properties of continuous fiber reinforced thermoplastic composite materials. Therefore, thermoplastic based composites find in many application areas in automobile, aerospace, construction, defense, transportation and marine industries. In recent years, hybrid fabrics; composed of continuous glass fibers and polymer fibers such as polypropylene (PP), {{have been used to}} fabricate thermoplastic composite with higher fiber volume fraction and improved performance. In this study, hybrid fabrics were developed by commingling the continuous PP and glass fibers using air jet and direct twist hybrid yarn preparation techniques. The hybrid commingled fabrics obtained with 450 fiber orientation and non-crimp fabric pattern. Non-crimp fabrics were obtained various fiber sizing that are compatible and incompatible with PP matrix to investigate the effect of interfacial adhesion on the properties of the thermoplastic composites.

40|$|Introduction Ruth Reeves {{pioneered the}} use of vat dyes and the screen-print process for {{furnishing}} fabrics in the late 19202 ̆ 7 s. Reeves had a positive genius for publicity, and if {{she was not the}} first American to experiment with these techniques, which she may well have been, she was without doubt one of the best known. Reeves was one of a new breed of textile designers who emerged {{in the aftermath of the}} First World War. To hope to work as a textile designer was a risky experiment in itself. American mills employed buyers and copyists in far greater numbers than they did designers, and consequently training in the field was largely unobtainable. As one critic of the system wrote [...] . textile pattern making was regarded as the lowest and worst paid of the arts. Quite properly our art schools ignored it, since it offered absolutely no field for ambition. 2 And so when Ruth Reeves began to exhibit her witty and original handprinted <b>fabrics,</b> the design <b>press</b> took notice, calling her work modern and refreshing, chic, and above all American. Reeves trained as an artist and she may have gone on to learn the essentials of printing in Paris, where she spent the years from 1921 to c. 1928. In Paris she studied with the painter Fernand Leger, who also designed textiles. She knew Raoul Dufy in Paris, and certainly would have known his work for Bianchini-Ferier, and she may have known Sonia and Robert Delauney, frequent visitors to Leger 2 ̆ 7 s studio. Reeves returned to the States in 1928. The wisdom of the times held that America had no design traditions of its own, probably had no sources of original design, and that modern design was almost by definition a European import. Citing those reasons, we had declined to participate in the 1925 Paris Exposition of Decorative and Industrial Arts. Consequently when Reeves and her colleagues opened the American Designers 2 ̆ 7 Gallery late in 1928 to prove that there was indeed such a thing as American modernism, most critics, if not all, were on their side from the start. Ruth 2 ̆ 7 s work was found to be particularly representative of the American experienc...|$|R
40|$|Now forging parts {{papermaking}} machines uses {{many different}} designs presses. Regardless {{of the type}} of construction, the water is filtered through paper to canvas cloth in the transverse direction, filtering water from the cloth can occur in the longitudinal direction (simple presses) or in the transverse direction (shaft with blind holes, grooved shaft, suction shaft). Presses of the native papermaking machines provide a dry cloth when pressed, about 35 ? 40 %. That is not enough, as for drying the paper spent a huge amount of thermal energy in the form of steam, so the development of the press, providing a significant increase in dry is relevant. One way of increasing dryness is usage of shoe press, which by increasing the length of the contact area increased while pressing, so dry cloth before drying section increasing to 50 ? 55 %. Work of presses of papermaking machine is measured by the amount of water removed, and uniform moisture content across the width of <b>fabric</b> after the <b>presses.</b> Dehydration capacity of presses depends primarily on the length of the extrusion zone delighted shaft and on the number of these zones. When pressing simultaneously with dehydration of the paper web changing its structure, increases the contact area between the fibers and the coupling strength between them. In the existing literature does not sufficiently covered shoe-type presses calculation that does not allow constructing them because kinetic regularities of the process is unknown. The {{purpose of this article is}} to establish the kinetics of the compaction and main parameters shoe-type press needed to develop methods of calculation and design shoe presses.

40|$|Thermo-physiological comfort is {{a complex}} feeling {{affected}} by clothing, environment and physical activity of a human body. It {{is very important to}} understand the influence of the different variables, such as air temperature and humidity, fabric properties and heat and moisture produced from the human body, and their relationships in order to design new textile materials that can satisfy the always more strictly requirements of technical textile in terms of comfort behaviour. While environmental conditions and metabolic heat and moisture production are independent variables that should be analyzed but that cannot be modified because they depends from the physical activity and from the environment where it should be done, garments behaviour can be modified, using different materials, construction parameters, etc [...] ., in order to give the optimal comfort behaviour. In the last decades, always more attention has been paid in the development of comfortable clothing for both technical and common use; for this reason the interaction of garments with both the human body and the environment {{has been the subject of}} many studies. This research work aims to analyze the comfort properties that can be measured for fabrics evaluation and to develop, using modelling techniques, a prediction method of comfort behaviour; four fabric properties, namely air permeability, thermal properties, liquid and vapour transport through the fabric has been analyzed. A fabric is a heterogeneous 3 D ordered structure made of fibres, yarns and trapped air and for this reason in order to be able to predict its comfort properties it is necessary to predict its geometrical structure using only its basic design parameters; this is the first stage for the development of any prediction method because comfort properties highly depends from fabric structure. In this work, starting from the basic design parameters of yarns and fabrics and using the geometrical fabric model developed by Hearle, all the fabrics geometrical parameters have been defined; later, using TexGen, an open source software developed at the University of Nottingham in 1998, the fabric geometries have been created. The second stage of this research work has been focused on the simulation of the fabrics comfort properties, for different fabrics structures and composition, and their comparison with experimental values. Air permeability, that represent the resistance to the air that flows through the fabric, is one of the most important parameters that influence comfort properties, because it influences both the vapour and moisture transport and thermal properties. Simulations that have been done show that it is possible to predict, with a good approximation, air permeability behaviour of different fabrics. Thermal properties, namely thermal resistance, have been investigated using a simplified geometry of textile fabrics in order to better compare the 3 D virtual model with the experimental tests; in this case there is a quite good approximation of the simulated values due to this simplified geometry. For thermal properties modelling not only the comparison with experimental tests has been done but also some simulations that better represents a real case, in which <b>fabric</b> is not <b>pressed</b> between the measuring heads but where its distance from the skin can vary from contact to some millimetres. Also vapour adsorption process have been investigated in order to analyze the behaviour of different fibres and for different temperature and relative humidity conditions. When the human body is under low physical activities the air layer between skin and fabric can reach temperature in the range of 30 °C to 40 °C and relative humidity in the range of 60 % to 90 %; in these cases the prediction of the adsorption mechanism, that is an exothemic process, has to be taken into account especially for natural fibres that have high values of differential heat of sorption. Finally a case-study, represented by a 3 D model of a back protector, is presented; using the experimental data measured in the climatic chamber at the Advanced Technology Textile Laboratory in Biella, some thermal simulations has been carried out. The research aims to develop a simulation method that starting from the basically constructive parameters of fibres, yarns and fabrics used to create any 3 D fabric geometries leads to a fully predictive simulation method that allow to reduce the costs for the development of new high performance fabric...|$|R
