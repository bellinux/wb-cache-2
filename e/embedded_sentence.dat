50|$|Investigations {{into how}} {{language}} {{interacts with the}} world are called theories of reference. Gottlob Frege was an advocate of a mediated reference theory. Frege divided the semantic content of every expression, including sentences, into two components:sense and meaning. The sense of a sentence is the thought that it expresses. Such a thought is abstract, universal and objective. The sense of any sub-sentential expression consists in its contribution to the thought that its <b>embedding</b> <b>sentence</b> expresses. Senses determine reference and are also the modes of presentation of the objects to which expressions refer. Referents are the objects {{in the world that}} words pick out. The senses of sentences are thoughts, while their referents are truth values (true or false). The referents of <b>sentences</b> <b>embedded</b> in propositional attitude ascriptions and other opaque contexts are their usual senses.|$|R

5000|$|Base space, {{also known}} as reality space, {{presents}} the interlocutors' shared knowledge of the real world. Space builders are elements within a sentence that establish spaces distinct from, yet related to the base space constructed. Space builders can be expressions like prepositional phrases, adverbs, connectives, and subject-verb combinations that are followed by an <b>embedded</b> <b>sentence.</b> They require hearers to establish scenarios beyond the present point of time. [...] A built space depicts a situation that only holds true for that space itself, but {{may or may not}} be true in reality. The base space and built spaces are occupied by elements that map onto each other. These elements include categories that may refer to specific entities in those categories. According to Fauconnier's Access Principle, specific entities of a category in a space can be described by its counterpart category in another space even if it differs from the specific entity in the other space. An example of a built space can be seen in the example [...] " [...] Mary wants to buy a book". In this case, the built space is not that of reality, but Mary's desire space. Though the book in reality space refers to any book in general, it can still be used to describe the book in Mary's desire space, which {{may or may not be}} a specific book.|$|E

His analysis focused on the occurrence of this pronoun in discourse in which the internal feeling of someone other than the speaker is being represented. Kuno argues that one of the factors that permits the usage of zibun is a context in which the individual whom the speaker is referring to is aware of the state or event under discussion - i.e., this individual's perspective must be represented. The sentence in 11) a. is considered grammatical because the individual being discussed (John) is aware that Mary comes to see him. Conversely, example 11) b. is ungrammatical because it is not possible for John to look pale when he is aware that Mary sees him. As such, John's awareness of the event or state being communicated in the <b>embedded</b> <b>sentence</b> determines whether or not the entire sentences is grammatical. Similar to other logophors, the antecedent of the reflexive zibun need not occur in the same sentence or clause, as is the case for non-logophoric reflexives. This is demonstrated in the example above, in which the antecedent in 11) a. occurs in the matrix sentence, while zibun occurs in the embedded clause. Although traditionally referred to as [...] "indirect reflexives", the logophoric usage of pronouns such as zibun are also referred to as long-distance, or free anaphors [...]|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between recursive <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding</b> and theory-of-mind (ToM) inference is investigated in 3 persons with Broca’s aphasia, 2 persons with Wernicke’s aphasia, and 6 persons with mild and moderate Alzheimer’s disease (AD). We asked questions of four types about photographs of various real-life situations. Type 4 questions asked participants about intentions, thoughts, or utterances {{of the characters}} in the pictures (What may X be thinking / asking Y to do?). The expected answers typically involved subordinate clauses introduced by conjunctions or direct quotations of the characters’ utterances. Broca’s aphasics did not produce answers with recursive <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding.</b> Rather, they projected themselves into the characters’ mental states and gave direct answers in the first person singular, with relevant ToM content. We call such replies ‘situative statements’. Where the question concerned the mental state of the character but did not require an answer with <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding</b> (What does X hate?), aphasics gave descriptive answers rather than situative statements. Most replies given by persons with AD to Type 4 questions were grammatical instances of recursive <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding.</b> They also gave a few situative statements but the ToM content of these was irrelevant. In more than one third of their well-formed sentence embeddings, too, they conveyed irrelevant ToM contents. Persons with moderate AD were unable to pass secondary false belief tests. The results reveal double dissociation: Broca’s aphasics are unable to access recursive <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding</b> but they can make appropriate ToM inferences; moderate AD persons make the wrong ToM inferences but they are able to access recursive <b>sentence</b> <b>embedding.</b> The double dissociation may be relevant for the nature of the {{relationship between}} the two recursive capacities.

40|$|Embedded {{noun phrase}} {{structures}} are frequently {{used in the}} Japanese language because embedded sentences make modified noun phrases more expressive. In embedded noun phrase structures, a noun phrase modified by an <b>embedded</b> <b>sentence</b> is usually created by extraposing the case, such as the subjective case, of the sentence. In contrast, there is another type of embedded noun phrase structure. In this type, the noun phrase modifying a certain case of the <b>embedded</b> <b>sentence</b> is extraposed. As conventional methods for analyzing embedded noun phrase structures do not take {{the existence of the}} Japanese double-nominal-case construction into consideration, the latter type of embedded noun phrase is handled as an exception. This paper describes a method for analyzing the latter type of embedded noun phrase structure based on the valency structure in the Japanese-to-English translation system called ALT-J/E. We regard the latter type as the structure derived from the Japanese double-nominal-case construction in which the adverbial particle &quot;wa &quot; is a proxy for the pre nominal particle &quot;no&quot;. This point of view leads us to analyze both the former and the latter types of embedded noun phrase structures uniformly based on the valency structure of embedded sentences. Moreover, this paper describes an evaluation that clarifies the validity of the proposed method. The evaluation results show that about 86 % of the latter type of the embedded noun phrase structures are correctly analyzed by the method proposed here. This means the proposed method is valid for analyzing embedded noun phrase structures derived from Japanese double-nominal-case construction. 1...|$|E
