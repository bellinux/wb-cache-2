500|$|Experience {{had taught}} me this: {{to find out what}} you’re capable of, it is only {{necessary}} {{to get a chance to}} do it—and someone else must have enough confidence in you to provide that chance. In my dealings with the young RCNVR captains <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> give them the opportunity to find their own feet and they did it. Once having tasted success they never looked back. What a blessing that we had the bright young peoples to accept this kind of responsibility" [...] – Admiral Murray.|$|E
500|$|... "Really Achieving Your Childhood Dreams" [...] was {{delivered}} on September 18, 2007, at Carnegie Mellon University's McConomy Auditorium. Over 450 Carnegie Mellon students, staff members, {{and friends of}} Pausch attended the lecture, leaving only standing room as {{this was more than}} the auditorium could hold. Pausch later commented about this in an interview, saying [...] "A couple of hundred people in a room, looking and listening and laughing and applauding– hopefully at the appropriate times– that gives a lot of validation to my kids {{that a lot of people}} believe in this, and a lot of people who knew me believe that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> try to live this way." [...] The first introduction of the speech as well as the series of lectures was given by Indira Nair, the Vice Provost for Education at Carnegie Mellon. Nair first explained the university's aforementioned lecture series called [...] "Journeys", in which eight more professors from Carnegie Mellon would share their insights on their professional and personal experiences over the years.|$|E

I felt I had done terribly but afterward, all these people {{came up to me}} saying, 'I've loved you since Ionia.' I also wrote a bassline for their song Nine Hours Later, which they invited me onstage to play at several shows." ...|$|E

2500|$|... "Personally, my {{relationship}} with P. W. Botha was often strained. I did not like his overbearing leadership style and was opposed to the intrusion of the State Security Council system into virtually every facet of government. After I became leader of the National Party in February 1989 <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> ensure that P. W. Botha {{would be able to}} end his term as president with full dignity and decorum. Unfortunately, this was not to be." ...|$|E
2500|$|Known for her {{remarkable}} {{dedication to}} her work, Tani would perform {{even the most}} extreme of S scenes without complaint. During the twelve years she worked as an actress, she never went to the beach or allowed herself to get a suntan, feeling {{that it was important}} to keep her skin very white, so that it could be seen turning red during some of the scenes involving such things as whippings or melting candle wax tortures. Tani wrote in 1998 [...] "The woman's naked body must not only be seen as a sensual object, but must also be able to express emotion; so, <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> keep Naomi Tani's body as close as possible to perfect condition." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{promoting}} the album, frontman and lead vocalist Stephan Jenkins recounted a pleasant experience in recording the album, referring {{to it as}} [...] "too much fun and feeling like...a complete recording group for the first time...We had these jam sessions that were fun". He also commented {{that it had been}} more collaborative than their prior album; bassist Arion Salazar became more involved in the writing and production, while drummer Brad Hargreaves was involved in the creative process for the first time, as he had joined the band late into their sessions for the first album. However, in retrospect, Jenkins painted a much more grim picture, citing time constraints, label pressure from Elektra Records, and isolation between members, stating: [...] "We did the last album in six months, we just whipped it out, and there's some things on that album, on the second album, that I'm so proud of...but the second album suffered from a kind of coldness almost. That's done in part because we were never in the studio at the same time, never rehearsed the songs together, never played them together. <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to,</b> to produce that record and {{it was very hard to}} do. Then we succumbed to the time pressures from Elektra to get the album out in six months which we did." ...|$|E

2500|$|Brooke {{recorded}} in his war diary on 3 October 1941, that a messenger {{had arrived at}} midnight with orders to prepare a plan to attack Trondheim in one week {{and that he was}} to go to Chequers, the prime minister's country house, that evening to discuss the idea over dinner. Accordingly, Brooke together with General Sir John Dill, Chief of the Imperial General Staff, Admiral Sir Dudley Pound, the First Sea Lord and Air Chief Marshal Sir Charles Portal, the Chief of the Air Staff and Clement Attlee, the Lord Privy Seal and Leader of the Labour Party were also in attendance. Brooke recorded that [...] "We sat up til 2.15 pm discussing the problem and <b>I</b> <b>did</b> <b>my</b> <b>best</b> <b>to</b> put the PM off the plan" [...] and that they [...] "Resumed discussion at 11 am and went on till 1 pm, I think PM is beginning to weaken on the plan". Brooke was mistaken and later wrote: [...] "From then on, we would continually be in trouble riding him [...] off mad plans to go back to Norway. Why he wanted to go back and {{what he was going to}} do there, even if he did succeed in capturing Trondheim, we never found out". On 12 October, Brooke was required to present a detailed plan for the Norway invasion, now code named Operation Ajax, which he had compiled with Admiral Sir John Tovey, Air Chief Marshall Sir William Sholto Douglas and General Sir Bernard Paget (who was to command it). Churchill complained that it was not a plan but a [...] "masterly treatise" [...] on the difficulties of the venture. Churchill avoided the main reason (lack of air support) during two hours of interrogation; raising details such as why he forsaw frosts (as stated in the Climate Book) and why would it take 24 hours to go from A to B (because of enemy resistance and removing road blocks). According to one account (but not mentioned by Brooke) Brooke suddenly relented and agreed to mount the expedition on the condition that the navy could take the fleet into Trondheim Fjord in support, but the elderly Pound merely shook his head and ended the discussion. [...] Churchill again asked the Joint Planning Staff to reconsider Ajax without reference to Brooke or Paget, but the JPS, and the Chiefs of Staff, supported Brooke's conclusions, citing the lack of air superiority or any hope of achieving it.|$|E
