5|$|FootTown's {{third and}} fourth floors house several tourist attractions. The third floor {{is home to the}} Guinness World Records Museum Tokyo, a museum that houses life-size figures, photo panels and memorabilia {{depicting}} interesting records that have been authenticated by the Guinness Book. The Tokyo Tower Wax Museum, opened in 1970, displays wax figures imported from London where they were made. The figures on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> from pop culture icons such as The Beatles to religious figures such as Jesus Christ. A hologram gallery named the Gallery DeLux, a lounge and a few specialty stores are also located on this floor. Tokyo Tower's Trick Art Gallery is located on the building's fourth and final floor. This gallery displays optical illusions, including paintings and objects that visitors can interact with.|$|E
25|$|AI-10 {{was similar}} in {{performance}} to the AIS {{systems of the}} same vintage, but Bowen found no strong desire {{on the part of}} the RAF to buy the device. This has been attributed to a number of factors including overwork by the AMRE team fitting their own equipment, as well as not invented here syndrome. However, two technical issues appear to be the main reason. One was that the system did not <b>display</b> <b>range</b> directly, and had to be switched to a separate display mode that was described as basically useless. Moreover, the set was far too large to easily fit into a Beaufighter, having been designed for the much larger Havoc (P-70) or even larger Northrop P-61 Black Widow.|$|E
500|$|A major {{attraction}} {{in the city}} is the Viking Ship Museum (Vikingeskibsmuseet) located alongside Roskilde Fjord. The centrepieces of its collection are the well-preserved remains of five 11th-century Viking ships, excavated from the fjord some [...] {{north of the city}} in the late 1960s. The ships were scuttled there in the 11th century to block a navigation channel, protecting the city, then the Danish capital, from seaborne assault. The five Viking ships represent several distinct classes, such as the Longship and Warship, and smaller fishing and ferry boats. The ships on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> from 10 feet (3 m) to 50 feet (15 m) in length. The museum also undertakes research in experimental archaeology centred on Viking shipbuilding and seaworthiness. The boatyard, which also forms part of the museum, safeguards the Viking boat-building tradition by building and exhibiting full-scale ships on site.|$|E

40|$|Circuit {{produces}} PPI {{display on}} conventional X-Y oscilloscope. Circuit requires three inputs. First is once-per-scan pulse to synchronize display to north, relative heading, or another reference direction. Second is once-per-degree-of-rotation pulse to advance sweep rotation. Third input is normal sweep ramp. Duration of ramp corresponds to maximum <b>displayed</b> <b>range.</b> Changing ramp duration, while holding its peak amplitude constant, changes maximum <b>displayed</b> <b>range.</b> Conventional methods {{to accomplish this}} task use mechanically-driven deflection coils or mechanically-driven sine and cosine potentiometers, requiring mechanical preventive maintenance plus dedicated display indicator. New method displays radar sweep on any conventional storage oscilloscope...|$|R

50|$|Alexandria Aquarium {{is a small}} {{aquarium}} in Alexandria, Egypt. It {{was built}} in 1930 and is near Qaitbay fort on Alexandria's Eastern Harbour. The aquarium exhibits many species from the Mediterranean and Red Seas around Egypt, {{as well as some}} freshwater species from the Nile and the Amazon. Animals on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> from fish to crustaceans and turtles (both marine and freshwater). The Aquarium is also home to the Marine Research Institute..|$|E
50|$|Textile {{exhibits}} show visitors how {{the pioneers}} dressed and “modern conveniences” {{such as the}} ice box and the wringer washer reveal how early residents lived and worked. Items on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> in size from the very large (such as the telephone switchboard from a hotel) to the much smaller (such as the collection of cameras and medical instruments). Display cases maintained by local Finns, Poles and Lithuanians are highlights of the heritage exhibits.|$|E
5000|$|Most tourist {{guides to}} this area discuss the fishing {{heritage}} of [...] "Ribeira," [...] a few kilometers away, but only mention A Pobra do Caramiñal in passing. However, the main commercial port of Ribeira is closed to the public, while its smaller equivalent at A Pobra {{is open to the}} public. Fishing boats on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> from dinghy-sized dornas to industrial sized fishing boats moored up at a quay that extends into the bay.|$|E

50|$|Early American and German radars {{used the}} J-scope, which resembled a {{circular}} {{version of the}} A-scope. These <b>display</b> <b>range</b> as an angle around the display face, {{as opposed to the}} linear distance along it. This arrangement allows greater accuracy in reading the range with the same sized display as an A-scope because the trace uses the full circumference rather than just the horizontal distance (so the time base is π times longer). An electro-mechanical version of the J-scope display remained common on consumer boating depth meters until recently.|$|E
50|$|The Midwest Gaming Classic has a {{focus on}} retrogaming, but {{displays}} modern game systems as well. The devices on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> from the newest gaming devices {{to some of the}} oldest, such as the original Pong. The event also attracts video game champions from the past. The event is known for its pinball games, gaming museum and modern game tournaments. It also has a display of gaming systems that never had success due to a superior competitor or change in technology. Nearly all game systems on display can be played by attendees.|$|E

5000|$|Sensors and Targeting - Previously, sensors were {{absolute}} and faultless, {{able to detect}} anything within 2 km without fail, though it was useless beyond that. Targeting {{was little more than}} repeatedly pressing the [...] "Next target" [...] key until you had targeted what you wanted. With Jets, sensors are no longer absolute, operating realistically, albeit heavily simplified. Stealth aircraft will be harder to detect and target, leaving radar on will give you away to the enemy, and the new custom info panels allow the player to adjust their sensor <b>display</b> <b>range</b> out to 16 km ...|$|E
50|$|These {{indicators}} actually measure {{angular displacement}} and not linear displacement; linear distance is correlated to the angular displacement {{based on the}} correlating variables. If the cause of movement is perpendicular to the finger, the linear displacement error is acceptably small within the <b>display</b> <b>range</b> of the dial. However, this error starts to become noticeable when this cause is as much as 10° off the ideal 90°. This is called cosine error, because the indicator is only registering the cosine of the movement, whereas the user likely {{is interested in the}} net movement vector. Cosine error is discussed in more detail below.|$|E

50|$|The GSR is a ground-to-ground {{surveillance}} radar set {{for use by}} units such as infantry and tank battalions. and BCT RSTA units. It can detect and locate moving personnel at ranges of 6 km and vehicles at ranges of 10 km, day or night under virtually all weather conditions. The radar has a maximum <b>display</b> <b>range</b> of 10,000 meters and the radar can alert the operator both aurally and visually. The APS/PPS-15 is a lighter, shorter ranged version intended for airborne, light infantry, and special operations force use. These radars are more MASINT then general purpose radar, as the simpler ones have very little imaging power, but perhaps a light or sound indicating the direction and range of the threat.|$|E
50|$|Further {{structural}} {{problems with the}} gallery forced its closure in the 1970s for urgent repair work. The collections were again dispersed for safe-keeping, {{and some of the}} works stored in the academy were lost in a serious theft in 1984. The gallery finally re-opened in 2005. The works on <b>display</b> <b>range</b> from the 17th to the mid-20th century. The oldest painting is by Jusepe de Ribera (1591 - 1652), but the museum is particularly noted for its collection of 19th-century works including those from the School of Posillipo, many of whose artists had been students and professors at the academy. In 2007, the museum's Gipsoteca, a collection of plaster casts of important sculptures and reliefs, was opened to the public. It contains over 70 pieces displayed thematically in four rooms.|$|E
