2500|$|Adjacent to Studio B was a {{reverberation}} room containing a plate reverb device made by EMT, German makers of similar effects units installed in other recording studios around the world. The EMT reverb was an electro-mechanical echo chamber used to add artificial reverberation effects to recordings. Porter {{arranged to have}} the dedicated <b>echo</b> <b>room</b> cooled down {{as much as possible}} with an air conditioner, and he adjusted the ten springs on the EMT plate to be tighter than usual, in order to feed the plate more audio signal and get a cleaner sound returning from the device. So much signal was being sent to the plate that Porter disconnected the associated VU meter so {{that he would not be}} bothered with its needle slamming against its peg. Porter related that the EMT's springs frequently broke under the increased tension, and he would have to replace them, but that the trouble was worth achieving a [...] "brighter and fuller" [...] echo effect.|$|E

5000|$|... 19 {{issues of}} The <b>Echo</b> <b>Room</b> a poetry {{magazine}} edited {{and published by}} Cleary appeared between 1985 and 1994. Originally the magazine was produced in A4 format later issues were A5. The magazine typically published a mix of new emerging voices often with links to Northern, regional urban centres. Cleary describes his editorship as a quest to discover an urgency in poetry that was missing in the mid-80s and to publish poets willing to 'get their hands dirty'. The <b>Echo</b> <b>Room</b> relaunched {{in the spring of}} 2012 with Volume 2 Issue 1 with support from Pighog Press in Brighton. The new magazine published many poets who had appeared in the original series of magazines and retained much of its original low budget style including a Matthew Caley designed cover and a substantial number of typos.|$|E

50|$|The Bridge Room is a {{good place}} to take a rest. You can hang your legs over the edge and listen to the stream that is 80 ft below.

One {{of the most popular}} and most challenging of passages in the cave is the Worm Tube. The Worm Tube is a long 150 ft crawl. It is a very tight passageway and unavoidable if venturing to the <b>Echo</b> <b>Room</b> and beyond. Other intriguing passageways include the Mason-Dixon Passage and the Pancake squeeze. When going to the waterfall or Raccoon Room, the stream canyon passages and the Z bends can be an alternate route to the Pancake Squeeze.|$|E

50|$|In July 1630, {{during the}} War of the Mantuan Succession (1628-31), Mantua and the palace were sacked over three days by an Imperial army of 36,000 Landsknecht mercenaries.

60|$|No tale {{of horror}} is {{complete}} without the rats. In stories of ghosts and murderers they scamper through the <b>echoing</b> <b>rooms,</b> and the gnawing of their teeth is heard behind the wainscot, and their gleaming eyes peer {{through the holes}} in the worm-eaten tapestry, and they scream in shrill, unearthly notes in the dead of night, while the moaning wind sweeps, sobbing, round the ruined turret towers, and passes wailing like a woman through the chambers bare and tenantless.|$|R

60|$|They went to {{the table}} soon {{afterwards}} and the shareholders began to arrive.

Some looked gloomy and some stubborn; a few looked frankly bored. There were five or six women and two whispered, while the others glanced about with jerky movements. Cartwright's face hardened when he saw Mrs. Seaton, and then he noted Hyslop in a back row. He thought Hyslop looked languidly amused.|$|R
60|$|Half an hour passed very slowly, and then, {{warned by}} a message, we strolled {{into the market}} to find there was {{comparative}} silence in the long <b>echoing</b> <b>room,</b> as those who congregated there grew languid and drowsy under {{the heat of the}} afternoon. Its atmosphere seemed suffocating, and before I had been present long the suspense reacted upon me physically, for my throat resembled a lime-kiln and the superficial arteries of my forehead throbbed painfully. Boone, at intervals, moistened his dry lips with his tongue, and Haldane alone leaned calmly against a pillar jotting down figures in the notebook he held.|$|R

60|$|Often {{we would}} go together, my father and I, to Guilford Street. It was a large corner house that had taken his fancy, half creeper covered, with a balcony, and pleasantly situated, {{overlooking}} the gardens of the Foundling Hospital. The wizened old caretaker knew us well, and having opened the door, would leave us to wander through the empty, <b>echoing</b> <b>rooms</b> at our own will. We furnished them handsomely in later Queen Anne style, of which {{my father was a}} connoisseur, sparing no necessary expense; for, as my father observed, good furniture is always worth its price, while to buy cheap is pure waste of money.|$|R
60|$|This credulity, {{unfortunately}} {{extends to}} ghosts. A rational person fresh {{from his own}} house would have turned on his side and slept. I did not. So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores {{of things in the}} bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart, so surely did I hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the <b>echoing</b> <b>room</b> behind the iron-barred door. My dominant fear was that the players might want a marker. It was an absurd fear; because creatures who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities. I only know that that was my terror; and it was real.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} simultaneous 2 -D room shape reconstruction and self-localization without the requirement of any pre-established infrastructure. A mobile device equipped with co-located microphone and loudspeaker as well as internal motion sensors is used to emit acoustic pulses and collect echoes reflected by the walls. Using only first order <b>echoes,</b> <b>room</b> shape recovery and self-localization is feasible when auxiliary information is obtained using motion sensors. In particular, it is established that using echoes collected at three measurement locations and the two distances between consecutive measurement points, unique localization and mapping can be achieved provided that the three measurement points are not collinear. Practical algorithms for room shape reconstruction and self-localization {{in the presence of}} noise and higher order echoes are proposed along with experimental results to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Echo later confronts Clint Buchanan on November 5, 2010 and declares that they are Rex's biological parents. Clint reveals that he had known about Rex for quite some time and that he forged the letters of Rick and Lili in order to keep Rex from finding out the truth. Clint dislikes and distrusts Rex, whom he considers a [...] "gold-digging piece of trash" [...] like Echo. Echo is wracked by guilt over abandoning Rex, and on November 12, 2010 she publicly reveals that she is Rex's mother. She names Charlie the father to protect Rex from Clint's wrath. Meanwhile, Dorian soon guesses that Clint is really Rex's father, and seeks to prove it.|$|R
