5|$|In the meanwhile, her father's {{fishing boat}} is {{taken away by}} creditors. He sinks {{into a state of}} sadness and begins to drink away their savings. On one occasion, Vanaja’s {{superior}} intellect pits her against Shekhar in a public incident which ultimately humiliates him in front of his mother. Matters escalate, and one day Vanaja is raped by Shekhar. She eventually loses her job when she becomes pregnant. She gives birth to a boy, much against Rama Devi’s wishes who would have liked her to abort the foetus. Vanaja hopes that the physical evidence of the child will be proof of the rape and that somehow Shekhar will be brought to justice. However, Shekhar has no desire to marry Vanaja because she is from a lower caste. In the end Rama Devi and Shekhar gain possession of the child, who will <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an upper caste boy.|$|E
5|$|Later that evening, Jiminy and {{his parents}} {{convince}} a couple {{to give up some}} goods in exchange for a tonic that will supposedly make them immune to a plague. He soon discovers that his father switched Rumpelstiltskin's tonic with the one they sold, and finds that the couple have been turned into dolls. Even worse, he then discovers that the couple were the parents of the young boy he spoke to earlier. Having realized what he has done, Jiminy makes a wish and receives an answer from The Blue Fairy, who shows up to give him his one true wish: becoming a cricket. Jiminy is also told that {{he has a chance to}} help someone in the future, starting with the young boy, who would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> Gepetto.

5|$|Riefenstahl fell in {{love with}} the arts in her childhood. She began to paint and write poetry at the age of four. She was also athletic, and at the age of twelve joined a {{gymnastics}} and swimming club. Her mother was confident her daughter would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> successful in the field of art and therefore gave her full support, unlike Riefenstahl's father, who was not interested in his daughter's artistic inclinations. In 1918, when she was 16, Riefenstahl attended a presentation of Snow White which interested her deeply; it led her to want to be a dancer. Her father instead wanted to provide his daughter with an education that could lead to a more dignified occupation. His wife, however, continued to support her daughter's passion. Without her father's knowledge, she enrolled Riefenstahl in dance and ballet classes at the Grimm-Reiter Dance School in Berlin, where she quickly became a star pupil.|$|E

25|$|People who are {{unfamiliar}} with horses may confuse an adult pony with a young, immature horse. While foals that will <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> horse-sized {{may be no}} taller than some ponies in their first months of life, their body proportions are very different. A pony can be ridden and put to work, while a foal is {{too young to be}} ridden or used as a working animal. Foals, whether they <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> horse or pony-sized, can be distinguished from adult horses by their extremely long legs and slim bodies. Their heads and eyes also exhibit juvenile characteristics. Furthermore, in most cases, nursing foals will be in very close proximity to a mare who is the mother (dam) of the foal. While ponies exhibit some neoteny with the wide foreheads and small size, their body proportions are similar to that of an adult horse.|$|E

25|$|Druids {{also play}} a {{prominent}} role in Irish Folklore, generally serving lords and kings as high ranking priest-counselors with the gift of prophecy and other assorted mystical abilities - the best example of these possibly being Cathbad. The chief druid in the court of King Conchobar mac Nessa of Ulster, Cathbad features in several tales, most of which detail his ability to foretell the future. In the tale of Deirdre of the Sorrows – the foremost tragic heroine of the Ulster Cycle – the druid prophesied before the court of Conchobar that Deirdre would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very beautiful, but that kings and lords would go to war over her, much blood would be shed because of her, and Ulster's three greatest warriors would be forced into exile for her sake.

25|$|The young {{crown prince}} grew {{up having to}} live up to a prophecy at his birth, which claimed that he would <b>grow</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a great warrior just like Minye Kyawswa. (According to the prophecy, Tabinshwehti was the reincarnation of a prince named Minye Kyawswa who was put to death by his father King Dhammazedi of Hanthawaddy. The prince {{supposedly}} prayed the same prayer as Prince Bawlawkyantaw of Hanthawaddy before the latter was put to death by his father King Razadarit in 1390. As Minye Kyawswa of Ava, who was believed to be the reincarnate of Bawlawkyantaw, grew up to be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy, Tabinshwehti, believed to be the reincarnate of Minye Kyawswa of Hanthawaddy, the prophecy claimed, would be the nemesis of Hanthawaddy.) The prophecy of a Minye Kyawswa reincarnate may have been popular in the superstitious world of Burmese politics since Upper Burma was going through immense political turmoil and decades-long internecine warfare. Since the 1480s, the once dominant power of Upper Burma, Ava, had been unable to prevent its key vassal states from breaking away. His father, who himself had broken away from Ava since 1510, required his son to receive an education in military arts. Tabinshwehiti along with Ye Htut and other young men at the palace received training in martial arts, horseback riding, elephant riding, and military strategy.|$|E
