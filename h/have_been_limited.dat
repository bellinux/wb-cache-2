These included but may not <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to the southern half of Northumbria. His background is obscure because of poor source documentation. The latter has facilitated disagreement amongst historians regarding his family and ethnicity.|$|E
5|$|Birds {{appear to}} moult {{once a year}} in spring or summer, {{although}} observations <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited.</b> Young birds spend about a year in juvenile plumage before moulting into adult plumage at around a year old. Juvenile birds have more brown-tinged and uniform plumage; the darker colour around the lores and eyes are less distinct. Their blackish bill is yellow-tipped, and the gape is yellow. Their eyes are brownish, but turn yellow early. The exact timing is unknown but likely to be around four months of age.|$|E
5|$|Cyprus {{appears to}} be the {{principal}} intermediary station between Mycenaean Greece and the Middle East, based on the considerable greater quantities of Mycenaean goods found there. On the other hand, trade with the Hittite lands in central Anatolia appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited.</b> Trade with Troy is also well attested, while Mycenaean trade routes expanded further to the Bosphorus and the shores of the Black Sea. Mycenaean swords have been found as far away as Georgia in the eastern Black Sea coast.|$|E

5|$|From the 740s {{until the}} end of the Northumbrian kingdom, coins were issued by most kings, {{although}} in variable quantities. Until recently no coins from Eardwulf's reign were known, which suggested that it may have been a time of instability, or perhaps that the kingdom was impoverished by the payment of tribute to Offa and Coenwulf of Mercia. It is now known that the issue of new coins continued during Eardwulf's reign, as two of his coins were identified in the 1990s. Issues of new currency appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> under Eardwulf, and significant numbers of Northumbrian coins are not again attested until the reign of Eardwulf's son Eanred.|$|E
5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw the zenith of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|Between 1996 and 2000, Saudi Arabia acceded to four UN {{human rights}} {{conventions}} and, in 2004, the government approved {{the establishment of}} the National Society for Human Rights (NSHR), staffed by government employees, to monitor their implementation. To date, the activities of the NSHR <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> and doubts remain over its neutrality and independence. Saudi Arabia was one of only eight countries that did not accept the UN's Universal Declaration of Human Rights when it was launched in 1948. Now, only Saudi Arabia remains openly opposed to the declaration. In response to the continuing criticism of its human rights record, the Saudi government points to the special Islamic character of the country, and asserts that this justifies a different social and political order.|$|E

5|$|During the German-led Axis {{invasion}} of Yugoslavia in April 1941, she and two Orjen-class motor torpedo boats evaded capture by Italian forces at the Bay of Kotor, arriving at Suda Bay, Crete, on 23 April, after eight days at sea. Despite this, the Italians {{claimed that they}} had sunk all the Yugoslav vessels. Nebojša then sailed to Alexandria, but the Royal Navy considered her unfit for combat duties. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested her crew might be retrained and used to operate the recently captured German Type VIIC U-boat U-570, but this idea was soon abandoned. She was based at Valletta in Malta as an anti-submarine warfare training vessel, serving with the British 2nd Submarine Flotilla in 1942 and the British 3rd Submarine Flotilla in 1943. She continued working in the Mediterranean {{until the end of}} the war, but her service with the Royal Navy appears to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to a training role.|$|E
5|$|Giant planets can {{significantly}} influence terrestrial planet formation. The presence of giants tends to increase eccentricities and inclinations (see Kozai mechanism) of planetesimals and embryos in the terrestrial planet region (inside 4AU in the Solar System). If giant planets form too early, they can slow or prevent inner planet accretion. If they form {{near the end}} of the oligarchic stage, as is thought to have happened in the Solar System, they will influence the merges of planetary embryos, making them more violent. As a result, the number of terrestrial planets will decrease and they will be more massive. In addition, the size of the system will shrink, because terrestrial planets will form closer to the central star. The influence of giant planets in the Solar System, particularly that of Jupiter, is thought to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> because they are relatively remote from the terrestrial planets.|$|E
5|$|Marriages {{were often}} {{the subject of}} careful negotiations, {{particularly}} higher in society. Marriage lost its sacramental status at the Reformation and irregular marriage continued to be accepted as valid throughout the period. Women managed the household and might work beside their husbands and, although obedience to husbands was stressed, this may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> in practice. Divorce developed after the Reformation and was available for {{a wider range of}} causes and accessed by a much larger section of society than in England. Because of high mortality rates widowhood was a relatively common state, and some women acquired independence and status, but others were forced into a marginal existence and remarriage was common. The elaborate funerals and complex system of prayers for the dead that dominated in late Medieval Scotland were removed at the Reformation and simpler services adopted. Burial inside the church was discouraged. As a result separate aisles for the rich and graveyards with stone markers for the majority became common.|$|E

5|$|The {{avenues for}} {{research}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> by many historical factors. Many archives were destroyed in bombing campaigns {{in the two}} world wars, and {{a great number of}} works for which records do exist are themselves lost or destroyed. The record-keeping in the region was inconsistent, and often the export of works by major artists was, owing to the pressures of commercial demand, not adequately recorded. The practice of signing and dating works was rare until the 1420s, and while the inventories of collectors may have elaborately described the works, they attached little importance to recording the artist or workshop that produced them. Surviving documentation tends to come from inventories, wills, payment accounts, employment contracts and guild records and regulations.|$|E
5|$|The {{introduction}} of feudalism {{from the time}} of David I, not only introduced sheriffdoms that overlay the pattern of local thanes, but also meant that new tenures were held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing system of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land, but the predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system on the English model impracticable. Obligations appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E
5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may have been dead, and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E

5|$|Chnodomar's {{men were}} of much less even quality than Julian's. His best warriors were the {{professional}} retinues of the regales (royal class, called ring-givers by the Germans), organized in warbands. They were well equipped with armour and swords, as behove their masters' status. The {{majority of his}} men, however, were temporary levies, lightly equipped and often inexperienced, like most contemporary Germanic forces relying on light equipment and speed. On the Alamanni side, {{there is little evidence}} of formation manoeuvres. The professional retainers of the regales may have had some capacity for this, especially as Germanic armies were by now very familiar with the Roman way of war. Ammianus' account mentions a globus (mass) of the best warriors coming together {{in the thick of the}} battle and breaking through the Roman line. In addition, several would likely have served in the Roman army in the past. But the majority of Chnodomar's men consisted of temporary levies, whose equipment and experience would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited.</b> According to Ammianus, they had to rely on a concentrated frontal charge to try to break through by weight of numbers, and proved no match for the Romans in the final phase of the battle, a prolonged struggle of attrition at close-quarters.|$|E
5|$|In {{the period}} c. 1150 to 1300, the warm dry summers and less severe winters of the Medieval Warm Period allowed {{cultivation}} at much greater heights {{above sea level}} and made land more productive. Arable farming grew significantly, but was still more common in low-lying areas than in high-lying {{areas such as the}} Highlands, Galloway and the Southern Uplands. The feudalism introduced under David I, particularly in the east and south where the crown's authority was greatest, saw the placement of lordships. Land was now held from the king, or a superior lord, in exchange for loyalty and forms of service that were usually military. Barons, who held feudal tenures, had the right to hold baronial courts, which could deal with matters of land ownership. However, the imposition of feudalism continued to sit beside existing systems of landholding and tenure and {{it is not clear how}} this change impacted on the lives of the ordinary free and unfree workers. In places, feudalism may have tied workers more closely to the land. The predominantly pastoral nature of Scottish agriculture may have made the imposition of a manorial system, based on the English model, impracticable in some areas. Obligations appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>limited</b> to occasional labour service, seasonal renders of food, hospitality and money rents.|$|E
