50|$|Fluopicolide is a {{fungicide}} used {{in agriculture}} to control diseases caused by oomycetes such as late blight of potato. It is classed as an acylpicolide and its chemical name is 2,6-dichloro-N-3-chloro-5-(trifluoromethyl)-2-pyridinylmethyl benzamide. The precise {{mode of action}} is not known, but it is thought to act by affecting spectrin-like proteins in the cytoskeleton of oomycetes. This mode of action differs from other available fungicides used to control oomycetes and it can inhibit the growth of strains that are resistant to phenylamides, strobilurin, <b>dimethomorph</b> and iprovalicarb. It has some systemic activity as it moves through the xylem towards the tips of stems, but does not get transported to the roots. It affects the motility of zoospores, the germination of cysts, {{the growth of the}} mycelium and sporulation. Bayer CropScience developed the compound and it was first released as a commercial product in 2006.|$|E
50|$|An {{array of}} studies have tested the {{curative}} and protective effects of various chemical compounds against P. ramorum in plants valued as ornamentals or Christmas trees. Many {{studies have focused on}} the four main ornamental hosts of P. ramorum (Rhododendron, Camellia, Viburnum, and Pieris). Several effective compounds have been found; some of the most effective include mefenoxam, metalaxyl, <b>dimethomorph,</b> and fenamidone. Many of these studies have converged upon the following conclusions: chemical compounds are, in general, more effective as preventives than in curatives; when used preventively, chemical compounds must be reapplied at various intervals; and chemical compounds can mask the symptoms of P. ramorum infection in the host plant, potentially interfering with inspections for quarantine efforts. In general, these compounds suppress but do not eradicate the pathogen, and some researchers are concerned that with repeated use the pathogen may become resistant to them. These studies and conclusions are summarized by Kliejunas.|$|E
5000|$|Infections {{of seeds}} and roots are {{initiated}} {{by both the}} mycelia and spores of Py. ultimum. Two spore types are made, depending on the strain. Py. ultimum is a species complex that includes var. ultimum and var. sporangiiferum. [...] The major distinguishing feature is that sporangia and zoospores (swimming spores) are produced only rarely by Py. ultimum var. ultimum. Both species make oospores, which are thick-walled structures produced by sexual recombination. Both species are self-fertile (homothallic), which means that a single strain can mate with itself. In addition to oospores, Py. ultimum var. ultimum also makes hyphal swellings which germinate in a manner resembling sporangia to form plant-infecting hyphae. One important ecological difference between {{the different types of}} spores is that sporangia and zoospores are short-lived, while the thick-walled oospores can persist for years within soil, surviving even winter freezes. Mycelia and oospores in soil can infect seeds or roots. This leads to wilting, reduced yield, and ultimately plant death. Common signs of a Pythium infection include stunting of the plants, brown coloration of root-tips, and wilting of the plant during the warm part of the day. Management of disease is challenging but focuses on sanitation, fungicides, and biological control. Fungicides include mefenoxam, thiadiazole, etridiazole, propamocarb, <b>dimethomorph,</b> and phosphonates. Biological control agents include the bacteria Bacillus subtilis, Streptomyces griseoviridis, and the fungi Candida oleophila, Gliocladium catenulatum, Trichoderma harziamum, and Trichoderma virens. [...] Effective resistance in the plant host is generally not available. Sanitation is very important since the pathogen can be easily introduced into pasteurized soil or even soil-free potting mixes on dirty tools or pots. Especially in greenhouses, fungus gnats may also help move the pathogen from place to place.|$|E

Greenhouse and field experiments were conducted to quantify and model the duration of pre- and postinfection activity of fungicides most commonly used for control of hop downy mildew (caused by Pseudoperonospora humuli). In greenhouse experiments, control of downy mildew on leaves was similar among fungicides tested when applied preventatively but varied depending on both the fungicide and the timing of application postinfection. Disease control decreased as applications of copper were made later after inoculation. In contrast, cymoxanil, trifloxystrobin, and <b>dimethomorph</b> reduced disease with similar efficacy when applied 48 h after inoculation compared with preventative applications of these fungicides. When fungicides were applied 72 h after inoculation, only <b>dimethomorph</b> reduced the sporulating leaf area similarly to preinoculation application timing. Adaxial chlorosis, necrosis, and water soaking of inoculated leaves, indicative of infection by P. humuli, were more severe when plants were treated with cymoxanil, trifloxystrobin, and <b>dimethomorph</b> 48 to 72 h after inoculation, even though sporulation was suppressed. Trifloxystrobin and <b>dimethomorph</b> applied 72 h after inoculation suppressed formation of sporangia on sporangiophores as compared with all other treatments. In field studies, <b>dimethomorph,</b> fosetyl-Al, and trifloxystrobin suppressed development of shoots with systemic downy mildew to the greatest extent when applied near the timing of inoculation, although the duration of preventative and postinfection activity varied among the fungicides. There was a small reduction in efficacy of disease control when fosetyl-Al was applied 6 to 7 days after inoculation as compared with protective applications.

Three fungicides, chlorothalonil (Glider), tebuconazole (Orius 25 EW) and <b>dimethomorph</b> + mancozeb (Volar) were evaluated in vitro for their effectiveness in inhibiting mycelial growth of ambrosia fungus associated with the beetle. The pathogen was exposed to four concentrations (1. 5 x, 1. 25 x, 1. 0 x and 0. 5 x times the manufacturer recommended rate) incorporated into potato dextrose agar using inhibition and food poisoning techniques. The three fungicides inhibited fungal growth to some extent, even at the lowest concentration (0. 5 x) and percentage inhibition was significantly different (P≤ 0. 05) from each other. Tebucozanole caused 100 % growth inhibition irrespective of concentration and technique used while chlorothalonil and <b>dimethomorph</b> + mancozeb caused less than 40 % inhibition for both techniques.

40|$|Três experimentos foram conduzidos utilizando-se o híbrido de tomateiro {{industrial}} H 7155 N, em 2003 e 2004 visando adequar um sistema de previsão modificado para o uso de fungicidas no manejo da requeima causada por Phytophthora infestans. Os experimentos foram conduzidos num delineamento em blocos ao acaso com dez tratamentos e três repetições. Os fungicidas sistêmicos foram aplicados quando o valor de severidade da doença (VSD) alcançou oito, dez ou doze pontos. A alternância dos fungicidas sistêmicos com o metiram ocorreu na semana em que não foram alcançados os VSD´s. O tratamento calendário de pulverização para o controle da requeima consistiu da aplicação semanal de fungicidas após o aparecimento dos primeiros sintomas e aqueles definidos pelo sistema de previsão foram baseados nos VSD acumulados durante o experimento. A avaliação da requeima foi feita semanalmente com auxílio de uma escala descritiva de severidade e uma chave diagramática. A eficiência dos tratamentos foi comparada calculando-se a área abaixo da curva do progresso da doença, a taxa de progresso da doença (r) e produtividade de tomate. Os valores de r do melhor tratamento (dimetomorfe misturado com clorotalonil (VSD = 10) alternado com metiram variaram de 0, 03 a 0, 07, enquanto para o tratamento calendário semanal foi de 0, 05 a 0, 09 e para testemunha de 0, 24 a 0, 39. Dimetomorfe + clorotalonil (VSD = 10) alternado com metiram produziu em média 15, 7 toneladas a mais de tomate, comparado ao tratamento calendário semanal de fungicidas. Dimetomorfe ou metalaxil-M misturado com clorotalonil (VSD = 10) baseado no sistema de previsão sem a alternância com metiram diferiu do calendário semanal baseado na severidade da doença e na produção de tomate.

Three {{experiments were}} carried out using an industrial tomato hybrid H 7155 N crop, in 2003 and 2004 seasons to fit a modified prediction system, which allows the criterious use of fungicides for the control of late blight caused by Phytophthora infestans. Trials were conducted in a randomized complete block design with ten treatments and three replications. The formulated systemic fungicides were applied when the disease severity values (DSV) reached eight, ten or twelve points. On weeks where DSV's values were lower than eight, ten or twelve, metiram was applied. The traditional late blight control consisted of weekly application of fungicides after the first symptoms disease, and those defined by the prediction system {{were carried out}} based on the DSV's accumulated throughout the experiment. Late blight severity was assessed weekly by using a descriptive key and diagrammatic scale. The efficiency of the control treatments was compared by the area under the disease progress curve, disease progress rate (r) and tomato yield. The r values of the best treatment (<b>dimethomorph</b> + chlorothalonil, DSV = 10, alternated with metiram), weekly application calendar fungicides and the check treatment varied from 0. 03 to 0. 07, 0. 05 to 0. 09 and 0. 24 to 0. 39, respectively. <b>Dimethomorph</b> + chlorothalonil DSV = 10 alternated with metiram was the most efficient and yielded more than 15, 7 ton of tomato in average, above the weekly spraying calendar fungicides. <b>Dimethomorph</b> or metalaxyl-M mixtured with chlorothalonil (DSV = 10) based on the prediction scheme without alternation with metiram differed from the weekly spraying calendar fungicide based on disease severity and tomato yield.

During testing of chemicals including pesticides, developmental toxicity studies are performed in rabbit. Despite its toxicological relevance, ABCG 2 -mediated transport of pesticides in rabbit placenta has not been yet elucidated. We therefore generated polarized MDCK II cells expressing the ABCG 2 transporter from rabbit placenta (rbABCG 2) and evaluated interaction of the efflux transporter with selected insecticides, fungicides, and herbicides. The Hoechst H 33342 accumulation assay indicated that 13 widely used pesticidal active substances including azoxystrobin, carbendazim, chlorpyrifos, chlormequat, diflufenican, dimethoate, <b>dimethomorph,</b> dithianon, ioxynil, methiocarb, propamocarb, rimsulfuron and toclofos-methyl may be rbABCG 2 inhibitors and/or substrates.

At present, cultural practices and chemical use are the options for managing Phytophthora blight of cucurbits. The most effective strategy for controlling P. capsici in cucurbits was an integrated approach of crop rotation for ≥ 3 years, seed treatment with mefenoxam (0. 42 ml Apron XL LS/kg of seed), avoiding the use of contaminated water with P. capsici, and fungicide spray-applications.

40|$|Phytophthora blight of peppers (Capsicum annuum) {{is caused}} by the oomycete {{pathogen}} Phytophthora capsici. In Arizona, the root and crown rot phase of the disease initially can appear on plants early in the growing season in areas of the field where soil remains saturated with water after an irrigation or rainfall event. Disease severity can increase dramatically due to summer rains during July and August in the southeastern Arizona production area. Fungicides are an important component of a Phytophthora disease management system, when used in combination with other management practices such as crop rotation, raised beds, and water management. The efficacy of the systemic fungicide mefenoxam (Ridomil Gold) for control of Phytophthora blight on pepper has been documented; however, in many pepper production regions, populations of the pathogen insensitive to this fungicide have developed. Other chemistries, including <b>dimethomorph</b> (Acrobat) as well as some new fungicides in development, have activity on some species of Phytophthora and associated diseases on crops other than pepper. The objective of the following study was to evaluate these additional chemistries for efficacy in suppressing development of root and crown rot on pepper plants grown in soil naturally infested with Phytophthora capsici in a greenhouse environment. The mean duration of survival for Aristotle bell pepper plants in untreated soil infested with P. capsici was 29 days. On the other hand, a significant increase in pepper plant survival was achieved when soil was treated with Reason (fenamidone) + Previcur Flex (propamocarb), SA- 110201, Ranman (cyazofamid), Omega (fluazinam), Ridomil Gold (mefenoxam), V- 10161 (fluopicolide), Forum (<b>dimethomorph),</b> NOA- 446510 (mandipropamid), IR- 6141 (kiralaxyl), and Maestro (captan). The data from this study suggest that several fungicides currently not registered for use on peppers may be effective components of a management program for Phytophthora crown and root rot. The data is promising; however, additional studies in field soil naturally infested with P. capsici are needed to confirm these preliminary findings as well as to determine the optimal application rate and timing for each new chemistry...|$|E

40|$|Pesticides {{have become}} an {{integral}} part of modern intensive agriculture and are applied extensively on a wide range of crops. Viticulture is one of the most pesticide intensive forms of agriculture due to the vines susceptibility for fungal diseases like powdery mildew. Although the use of pesticides has apparent benefits, it poses a risk for human health and non-target species in surrounding ecosystems. Since the introduction a lot of improvements have been made on the toxicity and environmental persistence of pesticides, but there is still a lot unknown about the environmental fate and community level effects of different compounds. The behavior of pesticides in soils is often poorly understood because laboratory results don’t translate to field conditions. Pesticides are believed to be immobile once they are sorbed to soil particles, but can be transported with particulate matter following erosion processes. This study aims to determine the levels of pesticide residues present in vineyard soils after years of pesticide application and to quantify the particle- facilitated transport of pesticide residues driven by soil erosion caused by runoff events. Three study sites with different soil types were selected in the Sao Lourenço sub-basin in Portugal. Plots were installed and soil and sediment samples were collected following runoff events. Collected samples were analyzed for pesticide residues using liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS/MS). Residues of six commonly applied fungicides (<b>dimethomorph,</b> pyrimethanil, pyraclostrobin, metalaxyl, penconazole and tebuconazole), one herbicide (glyphosate) and one metabolite (AMPA) were detected in the collected samples. Except for 4 samples of 1 site, all samples contained quantifiable levels of at least 1 compound. Except for <b>dimethomorph</b> at humic cambisol, no patterns of degradation were detected during the study period. Concentrations of glyphosate and AMPA were the highest of the detected compounds and were at least one order of magnitude higher than for the other compounds. Residue concentrations for glyphosate and AMPA were significantly higher in sediment than in soil and were related to particle size and organic matter content. Transport of particle-bound pesticide residues was highest at the site with the highest sediment export. The results of this study indicate that especially for glyphosate and AMPA, particle facilitated transport is a serious concern in areas with high erosion rates...|$|E

The transfer coefficients were obtained using the whole body dosimetry method for dermal exposure and the button personal inhalable aerosol sampler for inhalation exposure, using the tracer uranine as a pesticide surrogate. The case study was a greenhouse rose farm in the Bogota Plateau in Colombia. The approach was applied to estimate the exposure to pesticides such as mancozeb, carbendazim, propamocarb hydrochloride, fosetyl, carboxin, thiram, <b>dimethomorph</b> and mandipropamide. We found dermal absorption estimations close to the AOEL reference values for the pesticides carbendazim, mancozeb, thiram and mandipropamide during the study period. In addition, high values of dermal exposure were found on the forearms, hands, chest and legs of study participants, indicating weaknesses in the overlapping areas of the personal protective equipment parts.

Sensitivity changes to metalaxyl in Pseudoperonospora cubensis populations collected from cucumber and muskmelon fields were monitored during 2007 and 2008. Maximum number of sporangial populations (12 out of 25) exhibiting resistant response {{were collected in}} district Amritsar with ED 90 values of metalaxyl ranging between 30 - 150 µg/ml and resistance factor (RF) between 6 - 30. Most of the populations from Jalandhar and Kapurthala showed normal sensitive response. Resistant populations possessed normal pathogenic potential and exhibited strong competitive fitness when inoculated in mixture with sensitive populations. Resistant populations did not show cross resistance to fungicides with different modes of action such as azoxystrobin, cymoxanil, <b>dimethomorph,</b> fluopicolide, propamocarb, chlorothalonil and mancozeb. These fungicides were also found effective against metalaxyl resistant populations under field condition and can form {{a part of the}} strategy to manage metalaxyl resistance in practice.

40|$|O presente trabalho teve por objetivos avaliar métodos de inoculação de Nectria haematococca e Phytophthora parasitica e idades de Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa suscetíveis à infecção; avaliar a ocorrência de {{damping-off}} e podridão de colo do maracujazeiro em solo infestado; avaliar o comportamento de diferentes Passsifloraceas e genótipos de maracujazeiro amarelo aos respectivos patógenos; realizar testes de controle químico {{in vitro}}, tratamento químico erradicante em solo infestado e tratamento químico curativo em P. edulis f. flavicarpa para os respectivos patógenos. Inoculações no colo das plantas de P. edulis f. flavicarpa proporcionaram maiores níveis de doença comparadas às inoculações no sistema radicular, previamente ferido. Os resultados sugerem que N. haematococca seja um patógeno que penetra através de ferimentos. A mortalidade foi maior quando a inoculação foi realizada em plantas mais jovens e quando os patógenos N. haematococca e P. parasitica estavam em associação. Dentre as 17 espécies de Passiflora avaliadas para resistência aos patógenos, as espécies P. nitida, P. laurifolia e P. alata apresentaram as menores médias de lesões de N. haematococca, enquanto que para P. parasitica foram as espécies P. suberosa, P. foetida e P. morifolia as menos afetadas. Passiflora sidaefolia, P. edulis f. flavicarpa e P. edulis f. edulis foram as mais suscetíveis a ambos os patógenos, com sintomas que culminaram com a morte de plantas. Os genótipos de P. edulis f. flavicarpa mais resistentes a N. haematococca foram os procedentes de Morretes (PR) e a variedade Maguari e de Sapucaí (SP), enquanto que para P. parasitica foram os genótipos de Morretes (PR), Jaboticabal (SP) e LE 13 P 2 (IAC) os menos afetados. A variedade Sul-Brasil e o genótipo de Livramento (BA) foram altamente suscetíveis a ambos os patógenos, com sintomas que culminaram com a morte de plantas. No teste de fungitoxidade in vitro avaliou-se a eficiência dos fungicidas na inibição do crescimento micelial de N. haematococca e P. parasitica. Na dose 100 ppm somente prochloraz inibiu totalmente o crescimento micelial de N. haematococca e nenhum produto inibiu acima de 82 % o crescimento de P. parasitica. Os fungicidas prochloraz, thiabendazole, thiram+thiabendazole, carbendazim, triflumizole e captan exerceram controle erradicante em solo infestado com N. haematococca, inibindo a incidência da doença em plantas com seis semanas pós-germinação. O mesmo foi observado com os produtos kif, <b>dimethomorph,</b> metalaxyl+mancozeb, mancozeb, cymoxanil+maneb e oxicloreto de cobre para P. parasitica. Os fungicidas testados em tratamento curativo inibiram o desenvolvimento da doença com melhores resultados quando aplicados dois dias após a inoculação, comparado a sete dias. Os fungicidas prochloraz e carbendazim destacaram-se por evitar a morte de plantas inoculadas com N. haematococca e os fungicidas kif, <b>dimethomorph,</b> metalaxyl+mancozeb e cymoxanil+maneb apresentaram eficiência semelhante entre si e superior a fosetyl- Al no controle de P. parasitica. The {{objectives of the}} present work were to evaluate methods of inoculation of Nectria haematococca and Phytophthora parasitica and ages of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa which are susceptible to infection; to evaluate the damping-off and collar rot of passion fruit plant in infested soil; to evaluate the behavior of different Passsifloraceas and yellow genotypes of passion fruit to the respective pathogens; to carry out tests of chemical control in vitro, eradicative chemical treatment in infested soil and curative chemical treatment in P. edulis f. flavicarpa for the respective pathogens. Inoculations in the collar zone of P. edulis f. flavicarpa plants provided higher levels of disease {{when compared to the}} inoculations in the radicular system previously wounded. The results suggest that N. haematococca is a pathogen that penetrates through wounds. Mortality was higher when the inoculation was carried out in younger plants and when both pathogens were together. Amongst the 17 species of Passiflora tested for resistance to the pathogens, P. nitida, P. laurifolia, and P. alata showed the lowest average of N. haematococca lesions, while P. suberosa, P. morifolia, and P. foetida were the least affected species by P. parasitica. Passiflora sidaefolia, P. edulis f. flavicarpa, and P. edulis f. edulis were the most susceptible to both pathogens, showing symptoms that culminated with the death of the plants. The most resistant genotypes of P. edulis f. flavicarpa to N. haematococca were those from Morretes (PR), Maguari variety, and those from Sapucaí (SP); with respect to P. parasitica, the genotypes from Morretes (PR), Jaboticabal (SP), and LE 13 P 2 (IAC) were the least affected. The Sul- Brasil variety and the genotype from Livramento (BA) had been highly susceptible to both pathogens, having symptoms that culminated with the death of plants. The in vitro efficiency of the fungicides in the inhibition of the mycelial growth of N. haematococca and P. parasitica was evaluated. At 100 ppm, only prochloraz inhibited totally the mycelial growth of N. haematococca and no product inhibited over 82 % the growth of P. parasitica. Prochloraz, thiabendazole, thiram+thiabendazole, carbendazim, triflumizole, and captan controlled eradicatively the soil infested by N. haematococca, inhibiting the incidence of the disease in plants which were six weeks old. The same was observed for the products kif, <b>dimethomorph,</b> metalaxyl+mancozeb, mancozeb, cymoxanil+maneb, and copper oxychloride for P. parasitica. The tested fungicides in curative treatment inhibited the development of the disease with better results when applied two days after the inoculation, compared to seven days. Prochloraz and carbendazim were outstanding for preventing the death of plants inoculated with N. haematococca. Kif, <b>dimethomorph,</b> metalaxyl+mancozeb, and cymoxanil+maneb showed similar efficiency and were superior to fosetyl-Al in the control of P. parasitica...|$|E
