The main definition is contained in the international standard IEC 61508.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} low-risk, software-intensive safety-critical systems, {{it is crucial to}} identify and prevent risks during the early stages of software development, since most safety-critical decisions are made at that time. Even if limited information is available about the system under development, a detailed safety analysis should be applied, for example to derive safety-oriented requirements for safety-critical systems. Certain faults of software-controlled systems that are caused, e. g., by missing requirements can lead to fatal consequences such as death, environmental pollution, etc. However, traditional requirements engineering techniques do not focus on identifying hazards and their associated risks, but rather on identifying functional requirements consistently and completely, and safety analysis techniques are generally applied unsystematically when deriving <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> without consideration of the completeness of the functional requirements. Only few approaches have been proposed to identify the functional requirements (expected behavior) and the <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> (non-expected behavior) concurrently. But even the most closely related methods do not identify these requirements in a complete, systematic, intuitive, and effective way. Therefore, an approach for effectively and completely identifying both <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> is desired. To resolve these open issues, SafeRE is proposed in this thesis. SafeRE (Safety-oriented Requirements Engineering) is a novel method for concurrently and completely determining <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> It defines a general structure and a grammar for accommodating both <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> and proposes a systematic safety analysis based on the identified type-based <b>functional</b> <b>requirements</b> for deriving <b>safety</b> <b>requirements.</b> The combined safety-oriented requirements are then generated in a finite state machine and presented in an HTML-based specification. For obtaining the complete set of <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> a sequence-based specification methodology and its corresponding tool are extended. The extended tool is named SafeSBS. This approach was validated in one industrial case study and one research case study. The results of these case studies show that SafeRE is effective for identifying the safety-oriented requirements completely both in theory and in practice...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{adaptation}} {{means that}} components are reconfigured at run time. Consequently, {{the degree to}} which a system fulfils its <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> depends on the current system configuration at run time. The probability of a violation of functional requirements in combination with an importance factor for each requirement gives us a measure for reliability. In the same way, the degree of violation of <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> can be a measure for safety. These measures can easily be derived based on the probabilities of possible system configurations. For this purpose, we are introducing a new probabilistic analysis technique that determines configuration probabilities based on Fault trees, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and Markov chains. Through our recent work we have been able to determine configuration probabilities of systems but we neglected timing aspects [1]. Timing delays have impact on the adaptation behavior and are necessary to handle cyclic dependences. The contribution of the present article is to extend analysis towards models with timing delays. This technique builds upon the Methodologies and Architectures for Runtime Adaptive Systems (MARS) [2], a modeling concept we use for specifying the adaptation behavior of a system at design time. The results of this paper determine configuration probabilities, that are necessary to quantify the fulfillment of <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> by adaptive systems...|$|R

40|$|International audienceInternet of Things (IoT) is a buzzword for {{the term}} " {{connected}} devices ", which we {{used in the}} last 15 years to describe the trend of connecting embedded devices. It {{is driven by the}} need to shift the usage of embedded devices to the next level of efficiency. By enabling seamless communication between all embedded devices, we capture more data about the ongoing process and are able to influence the process for optimization. The realization of seamless connectivity is favored by the broad availability of Ethernet and wireless communication. Even real-time requirements are covered by specific industrial Ethernet protocols, which are fast enough to drive high frequency control systems {{with a small amount of}} jitter. With this seamless communication, <b>functional</b> <b>safety</b> and security of an embedded/IoT device become a challenge. A communication channel is always subject for vulnerability and can compromise the safety of the system because of a modified configuration. A security attack to a water heating system, which provides boiling water instead of tempered water, or a control valve for a chemical process, which is 'out of control' will definitely evolve to a <b>safety</b> problem. The <b>functional</b> <b>safety</b> of a system ensures, that a system does not harm its environment. Safety is ensured by implementing a safety concept in software and/or hardware.

40|$|Moore's law {{has served}} as goal and {{motivation}} for consumer electronics manufacturers in the last decades. The results in terms of processing power increase in the consumer electronics devices have been mainly achieved due to cost reduction and technology shrinking. However, reducing physical geometries mainly affects the electronic devices' dependability, making them more sensitive to soft-errors like Single Event Transient (SET) of Single Event Upset (SEU) and hard (permanent) faults, e. g. due to aging effects. Accordingly, safety critical systems often rely on the adoption of old technology nodes, even if they introduce longer design time w. r. t. consumer electronics. In fact, <b>functional</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> are increasingly pushing industry in developing innovative methodologies to design high-dependable systems with the required diagnostic coverage.

40|$|The book {{introduces}} basic risk {{concepts and}} {{then goes on to}} discuss risk management and analysis processes and steps. The main emphasis is on methods that fulfill the requirements of one or several risk management steps. The focus is on risk analysis methods including statistical-empirical analyses, probabilistic and parametrized models, engineering approaches and simulative methods, e. g. for fragment and blast propagation or hazard density computation. Risk management is essential for improving all resilience management steps: preparation, prevention, protection, response and recovery. The methods investigate types of event and scenario, as well as frequency, exposure, avoidance, hazard propagation, damage and risks of events. Further methods are presented for context assessment, risk visualization, communication, comparison and assessment as well as selecting mitigation measures. The processes and methods are demonstrated using detailed results and overviews of security research projects, in particular in the applications domains transport, aviation, airport security, explosive threats and urban security and safety. Topics include: sufficient control of emerging and novel hazards and risks, occupational safety, identification of minimum (<b>functional)</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements,</b> engineering methods for countering malevolent or terrorist events, security research challenges, interdisciplinary approaches to risk control and management, risk-based change and improvement management, and support of rational decision-making.

40|$|International audienceEmbedded systems highly {{contribute}} to the efficiency, safety, and usability of our present-day means of transport like cars and airplanes. Due to the possible hazards and risks involved with their operation, safety standards like DO- 178 C for avionics and ISO 26262 for automotive commend the application of methods and tools {{according to the state}} of the art. <b>Functional</b> <b>safety</b> <b>requirements</b> imposed on hardware and software imply the detection of malfunctions and taking corrective actions, before hazards actually occur. As described in [5] one of the key challenges thereby is the prediction and verification of the system's timing behavior. In this paper we describe a model-based approach for real-time simulation focusing on complex end-to-end data flows typically encountered in safety-critical automotive control applications. Based on first-hand experiences gained during the development of an electrical power steering control system, we illustrate how real-time simulation models can be utilized to guide design decisions, and help to achieve safety goals defined at system level. Furthermore, we discuss the issues of response time analysis for dynamic state-dependent data flows considering different semantics for communication {{in the context of the}} AUTOSAR standard. Engineers developing electrical / electronic systems for the automotive or avionics domain have to manage a high degree of functional, technological, and organizational complexity. Design and implementation of highly dynamic safety-critical applications make a model-based approach with careful consideration of fault tolerance indispensable. A fault-tolerant design follows a safety strategy which defines the (worst) conditions that a system must cope with, and defines safety mechanisms for fault detection and error handling that must be implemented. Such a design ensures that a system experiencing malfunctions remains operational â€“ possibly with reduced functionality â€“ and transits into a safe error-free state. Safety mechanisms built into a system are liable to hard real-time requirements. Hence, the transition into a safe state must be achieved under all possible conditions with respect to a limited time span, the so called fault tolerant time interval (FTTI) as defined in [23]. However, if one considers the many different factors that influence a system's timing behavior, e. g. the number of possible faults and failure states, the complexity of the data and control flow, or the scheduling properties of different hardware and software variants, it turns out, that finding a robust and reliable dynamic architecture design is a very challenging task. The problem of verifying the schedulability of processes and messages in a distributed system is NP-hard [7], and besides hard real-time requirements, for safety-critical systems additional requirements must be considered in order to guarantee dependability...|$|E
