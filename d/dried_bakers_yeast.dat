40|$|The {{specific}} cake {{resistance in}} dead-end filtration {{is a complex}} function of suspension properties and operating conditions. In this study, the specific resistance of resuspended <b>dried</b> <b>bakers</b> <b>yeast</b> suspensions was measured {{in a series of}} 150 experiments covering a range of pressures, cell concentrations, pHs, ionic strengths and membrane resistances. The specific resistance was found to increase linearly with pressure and exhibited a complex dependence on pH and ionic strength. The specific resistance data were correlated using an artificial neural network containing a single hidden layer with nine neurons employing the sigmoidal activation function. The network was trained with 104 training points, 13 validation points and 33 test points. Excellent agreement was obtained between the neural network and the test data with average errors of less than 10 %. In addition, a network was trained for prediction of the filtrate flux directly from the system inputs and this approach is easily extended to crossflow filtration by adding inputs such as the crossflow velocity and channel height. An attempt was made to interpret the network weights for both the specific resistance and flux networks. The effective contribution of each input to the system output was computed in each case and showed trends that were as expected. Although network weights, and consequently the computed effect of each parameter, is different each time a network is changed (depending on the initial weights used in the training process), the variation was low enough for information contained in the network to be interpreted in a meaningful way...|$|E

A novel multiscale model, describing <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>drying</b> in a conical spouted bed, is presented; {{it is based on}} an intrinsic drying model developed for a single pellet, combined with a gas–solid flow model developed for a conical spouted bed. The resulting phenomenological model, which has only one adjustable parameter, is in good agreement with the experimental results. The model is capable of adequately predicting the <b>drying</b> rate of <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellets during the entire drying period in a conical spouted bed: from the beginning, where the water removal rate is limited by the air saturation with vapor during its residence time in the bed; to the end, where the water removal rate is dictated by internal resistance within the yeast pellets. The quality of <b>dried</b> <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> was characterized by measuring the gassing power in bread dough. This parameter was monitored during the conical spouted bed drying experiments. It was found that yeast degradation is linked to intracellular water removal (type D, end of the drying below a moisture content of around 0. 5 (d. b.)) and it is mostly the rate of this water removal that controls the final quality of the product.

40|$|This profile {{provides}} a brief {{introduction to the}} yeast production industry with particular emphasis on the production of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast.</b> Yeast can be obtained either as the primary product of a process, {{as in the case}} of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> or as a secondary or by-product from alcoholic fermentations. Secondary yeast is usually preferred to primary yeast for use as animal feed for reasons of economy. Carbohydrates in the form of molasses or hydrolysed starches are the most commonly used substrates for yeast growth. Carbohydrate-containing waste streams from other processes and n-paraffins from oil have also been exploited for the production of feed yeast. Processes for the production of primary yeast vary but basically consist of materials preparation, seed yeast production, fermentation, yeast separation and pressing or drying steps, depending on the type of yeast required. About half a million tonnes are thought to be produced annually, slightly under half as <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast.</b> The size of plant can vary from half a tonne per day upwards. Plants have been built for n-paraffin feed yeast with capacities of 100, 000 tonnes per year.

40|$|The {{trehalose}} {{content in}} laboratory and industrial <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> {{is widely believed}} to be a major determinant of stress resistance. Fresh and <b>dried</b> <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> is cultured to obtain a trehalose content of more than 10 % of the dry weight. Initiation of fermentation, e. g., during dough preparation, is associated with a rapid loss of stress resistance and a rapid mobilization of trehalose. Using specific Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutants affected in trehalose metabolism, we confirm the correlation between trehalose content and stress resistance but only in the absence of fermentation. We demonstrate that both phenomena can be dissociated clearly once the cells initiate fermentation. This was accomplished both for cells with moderate trehalose levels grown under laboratory conditions and for cells with trehalose contents higher than 10 % obtained under pilot-scale conditions. Retention of a high trehalose level during fermentation also does not prevent the loss of fermentation capacity during preparation of frozen doughs. Although higher trehalose levels are always correlated with higher stress resistance before the addition of fermentable sugar, our results show that the initiation of fermentation causes the disappearance of any other factor(s) required for the maintenance of stress resistance, even {{in the presence of a}} high trehalose content. status: publishe...|$|R

An original experimental setup is developed allowing the characterization of the <b>drying</b> of a <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellet by using a precision balance, a microscope and an infrared camera. Using this experimental setup, the time evolution of the pellets moisture content, dimensions and surface temperature can be obtained in a large set of operating conditions (air temperature, air velocity and initial pellet diameter). The evolution of the fermentative activity of the <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> during <b>drying</b> as a function of its moisture content can also be investigated through the measurement of its gassing power. In this study, a set of <b>drying</b> experiments of <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellets in this original setup and with a data treatment procedure is presented. A new phenomenological model of the drying of a cylindrical <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellet is built on the basis of heat and mass transfer laws. It includes a description of the shrinkage of the material and it provides a link between the initial drying rate and the <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> activity {{at the end of the}} drying. The unknown parameters are identified by a comparison with experimental results. The combined use of the model and the experimental results leads to four main conclusions: three types of water exists in <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> pellets (a residual water, a water whose extraction is limited by mass transport phenomena in gas phase inside or outside the pellet, and a third type of water whose extraction is significantly slower); there is an isotropic linear shrinkage during drying which has no significant influence on the drying rate but which appears to be drying rate dependent as, at a same moisture content, a larger drying rate leads to a smaller shrinkage; the time evolution of the pellets surface temperature presents a change of regime at a moisture content of about 0. 6 (d. b.); the <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> activity remains high when its moisture content is larger than 0. 75 (d. b.) and the activity at the end of the drying is directly related to the initial <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> <b>drying</b> rate. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Background: Integration of second-generation (2 G) {{bioethanol}} production {{with existing}} first-generation (1 G) production may facilitate commercial production of ethanol from cellulosic material. Since 2 G hydrolysates {{have a low}} sugar concentration and 1 G streams often have to be diluted prior to fermentation, mixing of streams is beneficial. Improved ethanol concentrations in the 2 G production process lowers energy demand in distillation, improves overall energy efficiency and thus lower production cost. There is also a potential to reach higher ethanol yields, which is required in economically feasible ethanol production. Integrated process scenarios with addition of saccharified wheat meal (SWM) or fermented wheat meal (FWM) were investigated in simultaneous saccharification and (co-) fermentation (SSF or SSCF) of steam-pretreated wheat straw, while the possibility of recovering the valuable protein-rich fibre residue from the wheat was also studied. Results: The addition of SWM to SSF of steam-pretreated wheat straw, using commercially used <b>dried</b> <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> S. cerevisiae, resulted in ethanol concentrations of about 60 g/L, equivalent to ethanol yields of about 90 % of the theoretical. The addition of FWM in batch mode SSF was toxic to <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> due to the ethanol content of FWM, resulting in a very low yield and high accumulation of glucose. The addition of FWM in fed-batch mode still caused a slight accumulation of glucose, but the ethanol concentration was fairly high, 51. 2 g/L, corresponding to an ethanol yield of 90 %, based {{on the amount of}} glucose added. In batch mode of SSCF using the xylose-fermenting, genetically modified S. cerevisiae strain KE 6 - 12, no improvement was observed in ethanol yield or concentration, compared with <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast,</b> despite the increased xylose utilization, probably due to the considerable increase in glycerol production. A slight increase in xylose consumption was seen when glucose from SWM was fed at a low feed rate, after 48 hours, compared with batch SSCF. However, the ethanol yield and concentration remained in the same range as in batch mode. Conclusion: Ethanol concentrations of about 6 % (w/v) were obtained, which will result in a significant reduction in the cost of downstream processing, compared with SSF of the lignocellulosic substrate alone. As an additional benefit, it is also possible to recover the protein-rich residue from the SWM in the process configurations presented, providing a valuable co-product...|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> was {{evaluated}} {{as a substitute}} for live Dunaliella tertiolecta algae in the culture of the brine shrimp Artemia. Consumption of fresh <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> resulted in poor growth and survival of brine shrimp. However, the nutritional value of the yeast significantly improved after complete removal of the yeast cell wall by enzymatic treatment. <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> was also made digestible for Artemia by simple chemical treatment which did not reduce rigidity of the yeast cell. The external mannoprotein layer of the yeast cell wall is probably the major barrier to digestion by Artemia. Chemically treated <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> offers promising possibilities {{as a substitute for}} algal feeds in aquaculture...|$|R
50|$|<b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> is {{the common}} name for the strains of yeast {{commonly}} used as a leavening agent in baking bread and bakery products, where it converts the fermentable sugars present in the dough into carbon dioxide and ethanol. <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> is of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, {{which is the same}} species (but a different strain) commonly used in alcoholic fermentation, which is called brewer's <b>yeast.</b> <b>Baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> is also a single-cell microorganism found on and around the human body.|$|R

40|$|A simple {{staining}} {{procedure for}} the rapid detection of wild <b>yeasts</b> contaminating <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> {{during the course}} of industrial production is described. Fluorescein-labeled, specific antiserum against Saccharomyces cerevisiae is applied to smears of <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> which are then examined by ultraviolet microscopy. Optimal results are obtained with the combined phase contrast and fluorescence which makes the S. cerevisiae appear green, whereas cells of wild yeasts are visible in bright red counterstain. With this method, wild yeasts could be identified in <b>baker's</b> <b>yeast</b> at a dilution of 1 : 10, 000...|$|R
