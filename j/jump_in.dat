40|$|We {{study the}} {{high-frequency}} propagation of shocks across international equity markets. We identify shocks to stock prices, liquidity (quoted and effective spreads), and trading activity (turnover and order imbalance) for 12 equity markets {{around the world}} based on non-parametric jump statistics at the 5 -minute frequency from 1996 to 2011. <b>Jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices, quoted spreads, and order imbalance are prevalent and large, while <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> effective spreads and turnover are rare. Within a market, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices are regularly accompanied by <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> order imbalance, but are independent of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> liquidity. <b>Jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices and co-jumps in prices and order imbalance are primarily driven by information rather than liquidity, {{since there is no}} subsequent price reversal and since they often occur around U. S. macroeconomic news announcements. We also present evidence that <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices and order imbalance (but not liquidity) spillover across markets within the same 5 -minute interval. Overall, we find that order imbalances help explain why shocks to stock prices occur and spread across markets, while shocks to liquidity tend to be isolated events...|$|R
40|$|There are two central {{issues in}} option pricing: {{selecting}} an appropriate model and quantifying the risk premiums {{of the various}} underlying factors. In this paper, we use {{the information in the}} cross-section of S&P futures options from 1987 to 2003 to examine these issues. We first test for the presence of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility by analyzing the higher moment behavior of option implied variance. The option data provides strong evidence supporting the presence of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility. In conjunction with previous results, this implies that stochastic volatility, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> returns and <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility are all important components. Next, we find strong cross-sectional evidence <b>in</b> support of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> returns, and modest evidence for <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility. We find evidence for reasonable jump risk premiums, but do not find any evidence for a diffusive volatility risk premium. We also find strong evidence for time variation in thejumpriskpremiums...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{research}} {{has been unable to}} identify a strong link between oil prices and economic news. We reexamine this relationship using high frequency intraday data and relatively new methodology that we use to estimate <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> oil prices. We find a surprisingly strong relation between high frequency <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> oil prices and the arrival of new economic information, with the largest <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> oil prices tending to be preceded identifiable economic news. These results indicate that oil prices respond very rapidly to new economic data in ways that appear consistent with economic theory, and they suggest that economic news, rather than speculation unrelated to the economic environment, drives <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> oil prices.
