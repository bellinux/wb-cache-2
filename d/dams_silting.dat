That is an indication that “affordable micro-irrigation for vegetables” (AMIV) systems could be the answer for improving irrigated vegetable production in West Africa. This chapter examines the current issues of irrigated agriculture in the West African sub-region with particular reference to the potential of irrigation for income generation, employment and food security and suggests possible “growth paths” for irrigated vegetable production. It draws attention to the agribusiness potential that exists for all actors along the irrigated vegetable value chain. The paper is based on a comprehensive literature review of smallholder irrigation in several West African countries, particularly Nigeria and the Sahel countries, as well as a participatory rural appraisal field surveys in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mali, Niger and Senegal. The paper argues for concerted effort by the governments and the private sector (smallholder irrigators and agribusiness concerns) of countries in the dry areas of West Africa to systematically develop micro irrigation systems identified by this and other studies. There is great potential for their use to increase the incomes of smallholder farmers, including women and the employment of the youth in rural and urban areas. They are also important in ensuring food and nutrition security in both rural and urban areas in the West African sub-region...|$|E

40|$|Dam removal is a {{potentially}} {{powerful tool for}} restoring riverine habitats and communities. However, {{the effectiveness of this}} tool is unknown because published data on the effects of dam removal on in-stream biota are lacking. We investigated the effects of a small dam removal on unionid mussels in Koshkonong Creek, Wisconsin (USA). Removal of the dam led to mortality both within the former impoundment and in downstream reaches. Within the former reservoir, mortality rates were extremely high (95 %) due to des-iccation and exposure. Mussel densities in a bed 0. 5 km downstream from the dam declined from 3. 80 ± 0. 56 mussels m) 2 in fall 2000 immediately after dam removal to 2. 60 ± 0. 48 mussels m) 2 by summer 2003. One rare species, Quadrula pustulosa, was lost from community.

Total suspended sediment concentrations in the water column were always higher downstream from the reservoir than upstream, suggesting that transport and deposition of reservoir sediments likely contributed to downstream mussel mortality. Thus, while benefits of the dam removal included fish passage and restoration of lotic habitats in the former millpond, these changes were brought about at some cost to the local mussel community.

40|$|In Morocco, the {{spectacular}} expansion of erosive processes shows increasingly alarming aspects. Due to the considerable costs of detailed ground surveys for studying this phenomenon, remote sensing is an a ppropriate alternative for analyzing and evaluating {{the risks of}} the expansion of soil degradation. According to an FAO study (2001), Erosion threatens 13 million ha of cropland and rangeland in northern Morocco and induces an estimated average water st orage capacity loss of 50 million m 3 each year through <b>dam</b> <b>silting.</b> The lost water volum e could potentially be used to irrigate 5000 to 6000 ha/year. This study analyses soil erosion on the Oued El Malleh catchment, a 34 km² catchment located {{in the north of}} Fez (Morocco). This contribution aims at mapping the spatio-tem poral evolution of land use and modelling the erosion and sedimentation processes using the well known RUSLE model. Land use changes were assessed using Landsat- 5 TM and Landsat- 7 ETM+ images, from the 1987 - 2011 periods which were validated by field studies. The images were first georeferenced and projected into the Moro ccan coordinate system (Merchich North) then processed to evaluate soil loss through a GIS package (Idrisi Andes Software). These static assessments of soil loss were then used in a deposition/sedimentation algorithm to model soil loss propagation to the downstream. The soil loss averages determined by the model vary between 1. 09 t/ha/yr as a minimum value for the reforested lands and 169. 4 t/ha/yr as a maximum value for the uncultivated lands (badlands). The latter generally correspond to Regosols or low protected soils located on steep slopes. In comparison with RUSLE, the sedimentation model yields lower values of soil losses; only 97. 3 t/h/year for the uncultivated lands, and - 0. 34 t/ha/year in the reforested land, indicating an on-going sedimentation process. By taking into account the temporal variability of erosion and deposition jointly lower values of soil erosion are calculated by the RUSLE model. However, despite this decline, land degradation problems are still important due to the combination of land use and local lithology. The results of this study were used to indentify areas where interventions are needed to limit land degradation processes...|$|R

Even where the species occurs in protected areas, human activities upstream can still impact fish stocks and nesting trees. Overall, the species is widely distributed and populations currently appear to be stable.
