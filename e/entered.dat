50|$|Consider if {{the best}} {{response}} of the incumbent is to accommodate if the entrant <b>enters.</b> If the incumbent accommodates, the best {{response of the}} entrant is to <b>enter</b> (and gain profit). Hence the strategy profile in which the entrant <b>enters</b> and the incumbent accommodates if the entrant <b>enters</b> is a Nash equilibrium consistent with backward induction. However, if the incumbent is going to fight, the best response of the entrant is to not <b>enter,</b> and if the entrant does not <b>enter,</b> {{it does not matter}} what the incumbent chooses to do in the hypothetical case that the entrant does <b>enter.</b> Hence the strategy profile in which the incumbent fights if the entrant <b>enters,</b> but the entrant does not <b>enter</b> is also a Nash equilibrium. However, were the entrant to deviate and <b>enter,</b> the incumbent's best response is to accommodate—the threat of fighting is not credible. This second Nash equilibrium can therefore be eliminated by backward induction.|$|R
