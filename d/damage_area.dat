40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we propose}} an {{automatic}} detection method of the <b>areas</b> <b>damaged</b> by an earthquake. We use aerial {{images that are}} taken {{before and after the}} earthquake. To detect the <b>damaged</b> <b>areas,</b> we register these two aerial images. It is difficult to register two aerial images by using only the image information, and hence, we use digital map for registering them. First each aerial image is registered to the digital map by using the perspective transformation. Then we detect <b>damaged</b> <b>areas</b> by computing the differences between the registered images. The <b>damaged</b> <b>areas</b> can be detected automatically and correctly by our method. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} Canadian beaver (Castor canadensis) {{population has}} caused forest damage in Finland. However, the occurrence, extent {{and importance of}} the damage have not been comprehensively studied. The field inspection {{was carried out in}} all of the beaver <b>damage</b> <b>areas</b> (n = 50) in the Anttola, Juva and Pieksämäki game management units in summer 1998. The characteristics of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas,</b> types of <b>damage</b> and the severity of the damage were examined. The size of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas</b> averaged 2. 2 ha. The <b>damage</b> <b>areas</b> occurred on peatland forest more (p < 0. 05) than expected. The dominant tree species were commercially valuable trees such as Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) (33 %), Norway spruce (Picea abies) (18 %) and birches (Betula spp.) (47 %). Birch occurred as dominant tree species more (p < 0. 05) than expected. The proportion of older forest development classes was considerable. The most important type of damage was flooding (50 %) caused by the damming activity of beavers. The trees were dead or dying in 18 % of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas.</b> It was estimated that the ecosystem engineering performed by beavers was of no importance in 28 % of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas.</b> Prevention of beaver damage has been carried out in 80 % of the <b>damage</b> <b>areas.</b> In the study area, beaver numbers have steadily increased, although the number of beavers taken by hunting and the allowed hunting harvest have sharply increased. It is suggested that the methods used to prevent beaver damage should be improved and a compensation system should be provided by the state for the most <b>damaged</b> <b>areas.</b> Beavers can cause damage to commercial forestry, and this should be taken into account more effectively in the management plans made by the game management districts...|$|R

5000|$|Allegany State Park offers 18 {{hiking trails}} of various lengths and {{difficulties}} {{available for use}} year round. Six of the trails {{are part of the}} Art Roscoe Ski Touring Area. The trails within this system are groomed for cross-country skiing during the winter months, and are unavailable for hiking. The Ridgerun trail, {{which is part of the}} system, features a lean-to. The Art Roscoe trails are located near Summit in the Red House Area. In addition to these trails, The Allegheny Highlands Snowmobile and Horse Trail begins in the park off ASP 2. Another unique bragging right the park has is that the famous North Country Trail passes through it. The North Country Trail is a 4000+ mile trail that spans through New York, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, and terminates in North Dakota. Allegany State Park's 18 mi section of the trail includes 4 lean-tos, two in the Quaker Area, and the other two in the Red House area. The Black Snake Mountain trail is also unique due to its direct contact with the Pennsylvania state line. One of the attractions on this trail is a concrete marker shows the exact line where New York and Pennsylvania meet. It is short enough that one could sit on the marker, and be in two states at once. Many other attractions are viewable on or from the trails listed below. In the Quaker Area, the Tornado Trail tours the <b>damage</b> <b>area</b> caused by an F-1 Tornado on August 28, 1990.

The variation in internal <b>damage</b> <b>area</b> is correlated with ballistic properties of composite laminates.
