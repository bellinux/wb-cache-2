40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} {{a series of}} <b>delayed</b> <b>blasting</b> experiments at a West Virginia contour coal mine that resulted in smoother highwalls. The 17; were smoother due to reduced overbreak and inherently safer A, to reduced likelihood of rockfall. Reduced overbreak was accomplished by an increase in the highwall hole delays, which changed the effective delay pattern geometry and the direction of burden movement. The blast delays in the highwall holes were 50 to 100 ms longer than the mine's nominal design pattern (flat V, 17 - by 42 -ms surface delays, 200 -ms in-the-hole delay). The burden movement was effectively changed from a 45 * angle to 90 * with respect to the highwall. The results of the blast delay changes were evaluated using terrestrial photogrammetry to generate vertical profiles at regular intervals. This evaluation showed that delay changes produced generally smoother vertical profiles...|$|E
40|$|We have {{collected}} regional broad-band and densely-spaced short-period data for nearly 40 mining explosions from the Centralia mine, from two rockbursts in northern Idaho, and from several other explosions in the Columbia River Basalt {{and elsewhere in}} Washington state.

The type of <b>delayed</b> <b>blasting</b> at the Centralia mine may not be conducive to the detection of spectral scalloping or nulling, and this effect has not been clearly observed in preliminary spectral analyses of the regional seismic signals. However, these and other blasts generate relatively high-amplitude Rayleigh waves (Rg) that allow their identification as explosions at close distances. We are planning to make near-field deployments using broad-band, high-frequency seismic systems to characterize the effect of the delay pattern and charge sizes on the generation of regional seismic phases from the explosions at Centralia. Rockbursts from the northern Idaho region are due to implosional and fault-slip mechanisms, as determined from in-mine seismic systems. Such events are often triggered by the failure o...|$|E

Rocks around test site {{is a kind of}} granite. In this blasting, 11 chambers were formedwithin rocks and these were filled up with proper explosives. Total weight of explosives filledup in these chambers were about 6, 500 kg, and these explosives were fired by some delay de-tonators. The time from the instant of detonation of the initial chamber to that of the last wasabout 4, 000 ins. Some high speed moving camera and some pick-up which were used for observing the vi-bration of rocks caused by these explosions were used for verifying the detonation of each ex-plosive. It was recognized on this coyote blasting that the breakage of rocks by the delay blastingwas better than that by the instantaneous <b>blasting,</b> therefore, the <b>delay</b> <b>blasting</b> was useful inthe coyote blasting as same as the general blasting which was performed by the explosives load-ed in some drill holes, and also the verification of detonation was more easily on the delayblasting, therefore, adopting the <b>delay</b> <b>blasting</b> method to the coyote blasting was available onthe stand point of safety in operations...|$|R

40|$|As {{the first}} stage in the {{rulemaking}} process, MSHA prepared requirements for the approval and use of permissible explosives and blasting items in underground coal mines. These draft requirements known as "preproposals " were announced in the Federal Register in mid- 1984.

The draft requirements for approval of permissible explosives including sheathed explosives for unconfined applications, approval of water stemming bags, approval of detonators and approval of blasting machines were prepared as Parts 15, 16, 17 and 25 respectively. During the development and preparation of the preproposals, it was determined that field research on <b>delay</b> <b>blasting</b> of coal would be needed before the draft approval and use requirements could be finalized. In order to conduct the field research, an experimental site was acquired by the Bureau of Mines.

40|$|Blasting is an {{effective}} approach to pressure relief in coal mine roadway with rock burst tendency. To investigate the effect of blast impact on bolting support system and surrounding rock, dynamic response of bolting support roadway was numerically studied using FLAC 3 D. Firstly, the excavation and the bolting support of roadway were conducted to achieve the static equilibrium and then, with the built-in dynamic mode, blasting to pressure relief in the drill hole was performed in dynamics. The evolution of rock bolt axial force, grout shear stress and deformation of coal roadway were analyzed {{with regard to the}} time. The results show that, in the process of blasting impact, (1) the axial force of the first free bolt length (in the near end of roadway) increased by 6. 54 % in maximum; the shear stress of grout changed 43. 6 % in maximum. Hence, the near end of rock bolt and the bolt grout are weak points which may firstly fail under blast loading; (2) With the same distance to blasting position, the axial force of rock bolt is affected by its installation angle inclined to the blast borehole; and (3) the peak value of the axial force due to blasting impact can be reduced by adopting millisecond <b>delay</b> <b>blasting</b> approach. The maximum increment of axial force is reduced from 3. 94 % to 2. 86 % while using millisecond <b>delay</b> <b>blast</b> method.

This problem was approached by alterations in processing techniques. Two studies were conducted. ^ The objective of the first {{study was to determine the}} effect of meat processing temperature on the color of restructured beef steaks. Restructured beef steaks were made at processing temperatures of 4. 4, 1. 7, - 1. 1 or - 3. 9 (DEGREES) C using carbon dioxide snow to obtain the desired temperatures. The relative percentages of, deoxymyoglobin and metmyoglobin were not affected by processing temperature (P 3 ̆e 0. 05), as measured by reflectance spectrophotometry. Percent oxymyoglobin was higher in steaks processed at 3. 9 (DEGREES) (P 3 ̆e 0. 05). Product lightness, as measured by a Hunterlab colorimeter, increased as processing temperature decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 05) while product redness was unaffected. There was a decrease in oxymyoglobin (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and an increase in deoxymyoglobin (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) and metmyoglobin (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with time. Product lightness showed an overall increase (P 3 ̆c 0. 01) with time while product redness decreased (P 3 ̆c 0. 01). Product bind increased linearly (P 3 ̆e 0. 01) as processing temperature decreased.

In {{this article}} it is {{necessary}} to analyze the possibility of developing technology and increasing its efficiency during the Beskidskiy tunnel construction in difficult engineering and geological conditions. Methodology. The authors have performed analysis of the technological level of mining and construction works, new technique, equipment and production. One of the important issues of blasting operation is to ensure the seismic safety, acting at a distance of 30 m in the axes of single-track tunnel, as the distance to it will be 20 m from the nearest charge in the laying tunnel. This problem was solved by applying the combined blasting of blast-hole charges with delay-action and long-delay ways. Herewith the total mass of charges in the stope was divided into three groups, in which the first group is exploded by short-delay firing with, and the second one is exploded by short-delay firing too with intervals of 200 … 400 ms, the third is exploded by long-delay blasting at intervals of 500 … 10000 ms. The combined blasting of short-delay charges and delay action ones let significantly reduce seismic action at a mass explosion of charges when driving of double-track railway tunnel of a large cross-section. Findings. The paper presents the developed technology model, describing dependence of the machines from engineering and geological conditions. The methodology of drilling and blasting works at the construction of the tunnel callote and stross as well as a technique of arrangement determination and intervals of shot-delay and <b>delay</b> <b>blasting</b> of blasthole explosive charges was developed.

40|$|Blast-induced {{fragmentation}} plays {{a leading}} role on mining efficiency, hence many {{studies have been conducted}} {{in order to understand the}} mechanisms behind rock breakage and to improve the fragmentation. This report presents the results from field tests conducted at the Aitik mine belonging to Boliden Mineral AB in Sweden, which is part of a project called Vinnova. The project aims to evaluate the effects of short <b>delay</b> time <b>blasting</b> on fragmentation and other post-blast parameters which influence the comminution process, e. g. swelling and crushing. A total number of 6 benches were assigned for trials with different inter-hole delay times. Two of the benches were blasted with pyrotechnic Nonel caps and were used as references for further comparisons. Two benches were blasted with 1 ms of inter-hole delay time by use of electronic detonators. Two other benches were also blasted by electronic detonators, but with 3 ms and 6 ms of inter-hole delay time respectively. MWD (Measure While Drilling) system was used to log and analyze the drilling process in order to investigate the penetration rate and specific energy of drilling, which represent the hardness of the rock. GPS (Global Positioning System) and RTK (Real time Kinematic System) were used for measurements of benches’ swelling. The blasts were also filmed using a high-speed camera. Image analysis with Split-Desktop software was used to analyze the fragmentation of the rock after blasts. A series of images was shot from trucks carrying the ore and was later analyzed to obtain the fragmentation for each bench. Minestar integrated operation and mobile equipment management system was used to log the data from the fleet in the mine. The data were later used together with the crusher energy consumption logs to evaluate the energy efficiency of the crushing process for the ore from each bench. The tests showed that the inter-hole delay time of 3 ms resulted in the finest fragmentation among all benches; all examined values i. e. x 50, x 80 and xmax showed improvements upon other benches. However, the crushing energy of the ore from this trial was the highest among all. Two trials with 1 ms inter-hole delay time did not result in any significant variation compared to reference benches. The difference in x 50 values were ignorable, the same is true for crushing energy of the mentioned trials. The bench with inter-hole delay time of 6 ms resulted in the lowest crushing energy among other trials. However, the bench gave more boulders and coarser fragmentation compared to reference benches. Altogether, the results did not lead to any solid conclusion regarding the effect of the short delay times on fragmentation. Such ambiguity might be resulted by various sources of errors in data acquisition and analysis, as well as uncertainties regarding geology of the test area. In order to investigate the effect of <b>delay</b> times on <b>blast</b> results, more trials with more detailed data acquisition method is necessary. Godkänd; 2013; 20130429 (nikpet...|$|R
40|$|Non-ideal plasmas are {{difficult}} to model numerically and achieve experimentally. Here I focus on reaching the warm dense matter (WDM) regime {{at one end of}} the energy scale and the high energy density (HED) regime at the other. Both regimes access common, yet hard to observe, features in planetary core physics and astrophysics respectively. We have implemented several experiments developing both ionic, isochoric heating of matter to HED states, and probing the release isentrope through the WDM regime. Using sub-picosecond, ~ 100 J laser pulses, ion beams were produced in a thin foil interaction and then used to rapidly and uniformly heat ~ 20 µm wires to ~ 15 eV temperatures before hydrodynamic expansion could occur. Thus the partially ionised, strongly coupled WDM regime was accessed and then explored using streaked XUV and UV imaging of the expansion into vacuum, together with measurement of the ion spectra deposited in the sample. The calibrated ion spectra indicates the energy deposition occurs over ~ 400 ps and as such further investigation of the stopping power of warm dense matter is required. The high absorption of these laser pulses in cluster gases (> 90 %) was used to create HED blast waves. Under hydrodynamic scaling laws these blast waves can be used to model processes occurring within astrophysical phenomena. Schlieren, interferometry and ion probing methods have been used to spatially and temporally resolve the blast wave profiles. We describe high energy scaling experiments in the search for the thermal cooling instability, in which radiation from the blast wave modi es both its density profile and propagation dynamics. A unique perpendicular, time <b>delayed</b> colliding <b>blast</b> wave geometry has been used to identify up-stream characteristics of the front propagation and to pre-heat material leading to shock front acceleration. We show that ions of an energy greater than ~ 200 keV are required to probe the transient electromagnetic fields believed to occur at the shock front. The development and characterisation of low energy (0. 1 - 10 MeV) proton beams was necessary for studies of both non-ideal plasma regimes, particularly for probing high density media and transient electromagnetic fields. The application of ions to recover stopping power is discussed for WDM and HED plasmas. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Blast-induced ground {{vibration}} {{is one of}} {{the inevitable}} outcomes of blasting in mining projects and may cause substantial damage to rock mass as well as nearby structures and human beings. In this paper, an attempt has been made to present an application of artificial neural network (ANN) to predict the blast-induced ground vibration of the Gol-E-Gohar (GEG) iron mine, Iran. A four-layer feed-forward back propagation multi-layer perceptron (MLP) was used and trained with Levenberg–Marquardt algorithm. To construct ANN models, the maximum charge per <b>delay,</b> distance from <b>blasting</b> face to monitoring point, stemming and hole depth were taken as inputs, whereas peak particle velocity (PPV) was considered as an output parameter. A database consisting of 69 data sets recorded at strategic and vulnerable locations of GEG iron mine was used to train and test the generalization capability of ANN models. Coefficient of determination (R 2) and mean square error (MSE) were chosen as the indicators of the performance of the networks. A network with architecture 4 - 11 - 5 - 1 and R 2 of 0. 957 and MSE of 0. 000722 was found to be optimum. To demonstrate the supremacy of ANN approach, the same 69 data sets were used for the prediction of PPV with four common empirical models as well as multiple linear regression (MLR) analysis. The results revealed that the proposed ANN approach performs better than empirical and MLR models...|$|R
40|$|Straddle {{injuries}} {{are not to}} be confused with the stenoses that occur from pelvic fracture. With pelvic fracture, the injury is a distraction injury where there is disruption of the urethra and corpus spongiosum at the level of the membranous- bulbar junction or the membranous and the prostate. Here there is no real spongio-sum fibrosis and “urethral stricture ” – but scar tissue that fills the gap. Primary realignment is the preferred management of such injuries because it a distraction injury and not a stricture. Historically, the outcomes of primary realignment are a reduction in urethral stricture by 50 %, while the rates of erectile dysfunction and incontinence are the same as a suprapubic tube. Furthermore, the eventual stricture that does occur is often shorter and more amenable to urethrotomy. From the above abstracts, I think the conclusion that straddle injuries should be managed by suprapu-bic tube alone, as the best management that should be followed. Intuitively, we would assume that the Denis Browne principle would apply here and stenting would promote epithelialization. However, until a randomized prospective trial takes pace – and I doubt that any such study will be done soon – we should resist the temp-tation to primarily realign the urethra. As to urethral penetrating urethral injuries from low velocity gunshot wounds (no <b>delayed</b> ischemia or <b>blast</b> effect) the site of injury is typically short. A short area of injury can be bridged by adequate mobilization and natural elasticity of the urethra, particularly in the bulbar urethra. I...|$|R
40|$|Background: In {{the last}} 20 years Chronic Myeloid Leukemia {{became one of}} the {{predominant}} cancer in men and women in Sudan, based on referral data from the Radiation & Isotopes Centre of Khartoum (RICK), the only cancer centre in Sudan. The genetic studies are the building blocks of the future and the development of Glivec provides a dramatic example of how the understanding of disease biology and genetic abnormality can lead to successful molecularly targeted treatments. In this study the effectiveness of the drug among Sudanese patients, individual response of patients and factors influencing the prognosis were examined in order to gain more insight on the use of Glivec in Sudan as first line treatment of CML. Design : A descriptive‐retrospective demographic & cross‐sectional study. Setting: In Radiation and Isotopes Centre of Khartoum (RICK), Khartoum, Sudan. Objectives: The overall aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the effectiveness of Glivec treatment in Sudanese patients with CML based on haematologic and clinical remission. iv Materials and methods: The study covered CML (438 pts) who took the drug since 2003, was conducted during the period from June 2007 to March 2008. 185 patient were selected randomly and subdivided into 2 groups according to response of therapy, namely to responders and non responders or deceased patients. CBC, bone marrow examination, PCR, renal and liver functions were assessed in all patients. Responders were sub‐divided into groups according to duration of therapy: 3 months, 6 months, 1 year, 2 years, 3 years and 4 years. Results: • The mean age of all patients was 53 years with (46 %) Females and (54 %) Males. • Prognosis of CML patients who took the drug was impressive in that out of 438 only 51 (11. 8 %) relapsed or died throughout the period of the study since 2003, while 308 (70. 3 %) were regularly taking treatment and coming to follow‐up. • An incidental diagnosis was made in 22 of the patients (15. 8 %), out of whom 12 patients (54. 5 %) were females. • The mean duration of illness and symptoms before diagnosis was 14 months, ranging from 1 ‐ 24 months. • The most common symptoms were fatigue seen in 101 patients (72. 6 %) and fever in 56 patients (40 %). Extramedullary involvement occurred in the form of splenomegaly in 79 patients (56. 8 %); hepatomegaly in 29 patients (20. 8 %) and lymphadenopathy in 4 patients (2. 8 %). • The median WBC of patients at initiation of therapy with Glivec was 193 x 109, Median Hb 10. 3 g/dl, and median platelet count was 430 x 109. • Complete haematological and clinical response was reported in (86 %) of patients and was achieved within 3 – 6 months from the start of therapy. • Glivec in general was well tolerated, only 37. 4 % experienced side‐effects • Out of 438 patients 30 patients (6. 8 %) died with resistance to drug; 11 patients of them (36. 3 %) due to primary resistance, 19 patients of them (63. 3 %) due to secondary resistance. • The type of encoded protein (210 or 190) and interruption of treatment are suggested as factors which can have an impact on survival of CML patients since (40 %) of the deceased patients took the drug interruptedly and (54. 5 %) were 190 +ve patients. • Reticulin fibrosis was strongly associated with several poor prognostic features of the disease including huge splenomegaly, basophilia, anaemia and thrombocytosis. Conclusion: Although the results obtained with Glivec to date are truly impressive, longer follow‐up is necessary to draw definitive conclusions and to establish whether prevention or <b>delay</b> of <b>blast</b> crisis can be achieved, and whether an improved over‐all survival for the majority of patients can be obtained. Also, to help us pave the way for additional molecular targeted therapies and strategies in leukemia...|$|R
