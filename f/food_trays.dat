2500|$|In 2002, Wuornos began accusing prison matrons of tainting {{her food}} with dirt, saliva, and urine.

She also complained of strip searches, tight handcuffing, door kicking, frequent window checks, low water pressure, mildew on her mattress, and [...] "cat calling ... in distaste and a pure hatred towards me". Wuornos threatened to boycott showers and <b>food</b> <b>trays</b> when certain officers were on duty. [...] "In the meantime, my stomach's growling away and I'm taking showers through the sink of my cell."

40|$|Two {{experiments}} investigated autoshaping in rats to localizable {{visual and}} auditory conditioned stimuli predicting response-independent food. In Experiment 1 considerable conditioned-stimulus approach behavior was {{generated by a}} localizable visual conditioned stimulus that was situated approximately 35 cm from the <b>food</b> <b>tray.</b> Using the same apparatus in Experiment 2 {{we found that the}} conditioned-stimulus approach was generated only to a visual conditioned stimulus and not to a localizable auditory conditioned stimulus even though subjects (1) could discriminate presentations of the auditory conditioned stimulus, (2) had associated it with food, (3) could localize it, and (4) would approach the auditory stimulus if this behavior constituted an instrumental response to food. The predominant conditioned responses to the auditory stimuli were goal tracking (entering the <b>food</b> <b>tray)</b> and orienting towards the food-paired conditioned stimulus by head turning and rearing and turning. These results imply that rats do not invariably approach a localizable appetitive Pavlovian conditioned stimulus but that stimulus-approach responses depend on the nature and modality of the conditioned stimulus...|$|R
50|$|Aluminium {{containers}} {{are also}} popular for take-out packaging due to their low cost.

The level of satiety was measured using 1 - 5 Likert scale and all data were statistically analysed using Statistical Package for Social Science (SPSS) version 21. The results show negative relationship at medium strength (r= 0. 37) between the level of satiety with the number of people who share the <b>food</b> in <b>tray</b> and positive relationship at low strength (r= 0. 28) between the level of satiety with the number of food portion.

5000|$|One {{life-cycle}} assessment {{showed that}} replacing PTA {{in the production}} of PET by bio-based FDCA for the production of PEF has a potential for significant reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and non-renewable energy use (NREU). [...] Furthermore, PEF exhibits an intrinsically higher gas barrier for oxygen, carbon dioxide and water vapor than PET and can therefore be considered an interesting alternative for packaging applications such as bottles, films and <b>food</b> <b>trays.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, {{while he}} was in prison, the Ministry of Justice for Quebec laid a second set of charges against him and he was acquitted by another jury. He was, however, already in jail.

[...] The Ministry of Justice appealed this second acquittal but this time, the Quebec Court of Appeal unanimously upheld the acquittal (January 19, 1976).|$|R
25|$|Operant {{hoarding}} {{refers to}} the observation that rats reinforced {{in a certain way}} may allow food pellets to accumulate in a <b>food</b> <b>tray</b> instead of retrieving those pellets. In this procedure, retrieval of the pellets always instituted a one-minute period of extinction during which no additional food pellets were available but those that had been accumulated earlier could be consumed. This finding appears to contradict the usual finding that rats behave impulsively in situations {{in which there is a}} choice between a smaller food object right away and a larger food object after some delay. See schedules of reinforcement.|$|R

50|$|A {{timeline}} {{issued by}} Robert Patton, {{director of the}} Oklahoma Department of Corrections, revealed that Clayton Lockett was tasered after refusing to be restrained and escorted to a medical room for an X-ray exam {{as part of the}} protocol leading up to his execution. During his medical exam officials found a cut on his right arm, but staff determined that sutures were not needed. The timeline also revealed that Lockett refused a <b>food</b> <b>tray</b> twice. Patton also recommended in the letter to governor Mary Fallin that the state conduct a complete review of execution protocols, indefinitely suspend all executions, and investigate the circumstances surrounding the execution.|$|R
50|$|Food courts {{consist of}} a number of vendors at food stalls or service counters. Meals are ordered at one of the vendors and then carried to a common dining area. The food may also be ordered as takeout for {{consumption}} at another location, such as a home, or workplace. In this case, it may be packaged in foam food containers, though one common <b>food</b> <b>tray</b> used by all the stalls might also be utilitzed to allow the food to be carried to the table. Food courts may also have shops which sell prepared meals for consumers to take home and reheat, making the food court a daily stop for some.|$|R
50|$|Various {{standard}} equipment included interesting {{features such as}} a coat hook on the driver's side, AM radio (AM/FM and AM/FM Cassette were optional), scuff plates and vent windows. The back of the glove compartment door featured coin slots and cup depressions to hold cups and food similar to a <b>food</b> <b>tray</b> on a train. This was a feature only found on this generation and never on later models. It also showed a diagram with lift points {{as well as other}} mechanical information. Sliding rear windows were optional as well as cargo lights, under-hood lights, and many others. Ford offered over 150 options for the seventh-generation F-Series.|$|R
