5|$|During the argument, {{a scuffle}} ensued between Pandey {{and the group}} of men. He was beaten, gagged and knocked {{unconscious}} with an <b>iron</b> <b>rod.</b> The men then dragged Jyoti {{to the rear of}} the bus, beating her with the rod and raping her while the bus driver continued to drive. Medical reports later said that she suffered serious injuries to her abdomen, intestines and genitals due to the assault, and doctors said that the damage indicated that a blunt object (suspected to be the <b>iron</b> <b>rod)</b> may have been used for penetration. That rod was later described by police as being a rusted, L-shaped implement of the type used as a wheel jack handle.|$|E
5|$|Perhaps {{the first}} {{reported}} case of personality change after brain injury {{is that of}} Phineas Gage, who survived an accident in which a large <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> was driven through his head, destroying {{one or both of}} his frontal lobes; numerous cases of personality change after brain injury have been reported since.|$|E
5|$|To {{test his}} theory, Franklin {{proposed}} a potentially deadly experiment, {{to be performed}} during an electrical storm, where a person would stand on an insulated stool inside a sentry box, and hold out a long pointed <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> to attract a lightning bolt. This experiment was first performed successfully in France On May 10, 1752, and later repeated several more times throughout Europe. Franklin proved by this sentry-box experiment that lightning and electricity were one and the same.|$|E

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|Much of Carter's {{inspiration}} for the episode came from reports of Phineas Gage, who underwent a personality change after a blasting accident drove an <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> completely through his head (though the idea that Gage became violent, immoral, or a pathological liar, as Scully describes him, is without foundation). The aliens' use of a dental drill on Barry {{was inspired by a}} neighbour of Carter who said that he was abducted and that the aliens drilled holes into his teeth – which a dentist analyzed and said could not be done with any equipment he knew.|$|E
5|$|Doubt {{about the}} {{possibility}} of a mechanistic explanation of thought drove René Descartes, and most other philosophers along with him, to dualism: the belief that the mind is to some degree independent of the brain. There has always, however, been a strong argument in the opposite direction. There is clear empirical evidence that physical manipulations of, or injuries to, the brain (for example by drugs or by lesions, respectively) can affect the mind in potent and intimate ways. In the 19th century, the case of Phineas Gage, a railway worker who was injured by a stout <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> passing through his brain, convinced both researchers and the public that cognitive functions were localised in the brain. Following this line of thinking, a large body of empirical evidence for a close relationship between brain activity and mental activity has led most neuroscientists and contemporary philosophers to be materialists, believing that mental phenomena are ultimately the result of, or reducible to, physical phenomena.|$|E

5|$|In the Holy Roman Empire (and {{elsewhere}} in Central/Eastern Europe), women who killed their newborn could be {{liable to be}} placed in an open grave, and have a stake hammered into their heart. A detailed description of an execution in this manner comes from 17th century Košice (then in Hungary, now in eastern Slovakia). A woman to be executed for infanticide involved an executioner and two assistants to help him. First, a grave some one-and-a-half ell deep was dug. The woman was placed within it, her hands and feet secured by driving nails through them. The executioner placed a small thorn bush upon her face. He then placed, and held vertically, a wooden stave at her heart to mark its location, while his assistants piled earth on the woman, keeping her head free of earth {{at the behest of the}} clerics, however, as to do otherwise would have quickened the death process. Once the earth had been piled upon her, the executioner grabbed with a pair of tongs a rod made of iron, which had been made red hot. He positioned the glowing <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> beside the wooden stave, and as one of his assistants hammered the rod in, the other assistant emptied a trough of earth upon the woman's head. It is said that a scream was heard, and that the earth actually moved upwards for a moment, before all was over.|$|E
5|$|A {{research}} survey at Kodumanal has unearthed {{the remains}} of an ancient blast furnace, its circular base distinguishable by its white colour, probably the result of high temperature. Around the base, many iron slags, some with embedded burnt clay, vitrified brick-bats, many terracotta pipes with vitrified mouths and a granite slab, {{which may have been}} the anvil, have been recovered. Absence of potsherds and other antiquities has suggested that the smelting place was located outside the boundary of habitation. More furnaces were discovered at the same site with burnt clay pieces with rectangular holes. The pieces were part of the furnace wall, the holes designed to allow a natural draught of air to pass through evenly into the furnace. Many vitrified crucibles were also recovered from this site; one of them notable because it was found in an in situ position. Evidence of steel making is also found in the crucibles excavated at this site. In addition to iron and steel, the metallurgy seems to have possibly extended to copper, bronze, lead, silver and gold objects. At Arikamedu, there were indications of small-scale workshops containing {{the remains of}} working in metal, glass, semiprecious stones, ivory and shell. Kodumanal has yielded evidence for the practice of weaving, {{in the form of a}} number of intact terracotta spindle whorls pierced at the centre by means of an <b>iron</b> <b>rod,</b> indicating the knowledge of cotton spinning and weaving. To further strengthen this theory, a well preserved piece of woven cotton cloth was also recovered from this site. Dyeing vats were spotted at Arikamedu.|$|E

He also knew {{a little bit of}} magic. He used to perform tricks in schools and college without any payment. A {{maternal}} uncle enrolled Das in Lion Circus. At the Lion Circus, Das performed rare feats like cutting <b>iron</b> <b>rods</b> using teeth, bending <b>iron</b> <b>rods</b> using neck, weightlifting, throwing javelins and dagger boards. In 1948, Das formed his own circus known as the Royal Pakistan Circus.|$|R

25|$|Biology plays a very {{important}} {{role in the development of}} personality. The study of the biological level in personality psychology focuses primarily on identifying the role of genetic determinants and how they mold individual personalities. Some of the earliest thinking about possible biological bases of personality grew out of the case of Phineas Gage. In an 1848 accident, a large <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> was driven through Gage's head, and his personality apparently changed as a result, although descriptions of these psychological changes are usually exaggerated.|$|E
25|$|Phineas Gage, who {{suffered}} destruction {{of one or}} both frontal lobes by a projectile <b>iron</b> <b>rod,</b> is often cited as an example illustrating that the brain causes mind. Gage certainly exhibited some mental changes after his accident. This physical event, the destruction of part of his brain, therefore caused some kind of change in his mind, suggesting a correlation between brain states and mental states. Similar examples abound; neuroscientist David Eagleman describes the case of another individual who exhibited escalating pedophilic tendencies at two different times, and in each case {{was found to have}} tumors growing in a particular part of his brain.|$|E

25|$|A {{magnetic}} rod is required when constructing a compass. This {{can be created}} by aligning an iron or steel rod with Earth's magnetic field and then tempering or striking it. However, this method produces only a weak magnet so other methods are preferred. For example, a magnetised rod can be created by repeatedly rubbing an <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> with a magnetic lodestone. This magnetised rod (or magnetic needle) is then placed on a low friction surface {{to allow it to}} freely pivot to align itself with the magnetic field. It is then labeled so the user can distinguish the north-pointing from the south-pointing end; in modern convention the north end is typically marked in some way.|$|E
25|$|According to news reports, {{the driver}} of the minibus {{attempted}} to rape Özgecan, but she resisted by using pepper spray. Following this, he stabbed her multiple times, and beat her to death with an <b>iron</b> <b>rod.</b> He returned to Tarsus following the murder and asked for help from his father and a friend. The three men burnt Özgecan's body together in a forest and cut off her hands, as Özgecan had scratched the perpetrator's face during the struggle, and they feared that his DNA would be identified on the fingernails. Later, the post-mortem examination revealed that she had not been raped and DNA of the prime suspect was indeed found on her fingernails.|$|E
25|$|According to Berdella, Pearson {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{cooperative}} of his six murder victims. On the fifth day of his captivity, having by this stage endured torture such as the repeated administration of electrical shocks with the transformer, and the breaking of several hand bones with an <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> to render him submissive, Berdella deduced Pearson had earned his trust as to his continued cooperation in his sexual and physical abuse; as a form of reward, Pearson was moved to the second floor, with Berdella first informing Pearson that if he continued to cooperate, he (Berdella) would not continue to inflict as much pain upon him as he had done so while he had been held captive in the basement. Throughout the latter part of his six weeks of captivity, Pearson trained himself to sleep without moving, in order that he did not antagonize Berdella and thus invite further torture or being returned to the basement.|$|E

25|$|The {{interior}} is plastered and painted blue, encircled granite base and sections defined by pilasters where iron structures that support that roof are affixed, lined with wooden lathes painted in blue. The main doorways {{are in the}} east, north and west preceded by three ample stairs with iron guardrail and ceramic flooring. In {{the centre of the}} building is the primitive buvette thermal spring recessed into an octagonal plan with similar pavement, and protected by iron grate, painted green (with faceted basins on angles). The fountain is protected by a cylindrical bell-shaped structure. Around the building is a raised wing, accessed by an intermediary landing of stairs, with black and white ceramic floors and iron guard painted green, decorated by stylized voluptuous motifs. These structures also integrate lamps on their angles into the high columns, with globe of lighting surrounded by several stylized arms (the globe lighting repeated from the ceiling). A gutter runs along the lowest part of the interior with drains in the corners. A centralized apparatus opens the six central rotary panels; by using a vertical <b>iron</b> <b>rod,</b> moved by a lever, allows the windows to be opened simultaneously. The rooftop is a grid of horizontal rods with bearings that run north to south supporting the weight of the structure.|$|E
500|$|The French translation, {{published}} in 1752, contained an experiment {{suggesting that a}} long, pointed <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> would attract a lightning bolt from a thunderstorm cloud. In 1750 Hopkinson suggested to Franklin the concept that electricity is attracted to points. Franklin then carried the idea a step forward and surmised that a pointed <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> high above a rooftop would attract a lightning bolt, if the bolt was of electricity. Frenchman Thomas-Francois d'Alibald did the actual experiment May 10, 1752, as Franklin had suggested and lightning struck the <b>iron</b> <b>rod.</b> In London it was repeated in Spital Square on July 20, 1752, and again in Chelmsford, Essex, on August 12, 1752. The electricity attraction from a lightning storm was also done by Franklin himself in the kite experiment that he talked about {{in a letter to}} Collinson dated October 19, 1752. A {{man by the name of}} G. W. Richman was killed in 1753 from electrocution doing the kite experiment. Franklin had proven that lightning bolts and electricity were one and the same. He also showed that this [...] "electric fluid" [...] was attracted to a sharply pointed object high in the sky. An <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> could have the other end put into the ground to create a path for safe conduction of the high voltage electricity. Thus, a way of diverting lightning bolts from wooden buildings [...] and preventing them from going aflame due to lightning hits [...] had been discovered. Franklin's lightning conductor invention, with its lightning rod uppermost point, became a model for the lightning-protection system used in America in the eighteenth century.|$|E
500|$|Franklin's friend Kinnersley {{traveled}} {{throughout the}} eastern United States in the 1750s demonstrating man-made [...] "lightning" [...] on model thunder houses {{to show a}} how an <b>iron</b> <b>rod</b> placed into the ground would protect a wooden structure. He explained that lightning followed the same principles as the sparks from Franklin's electrostatic machine. These lectures by Kinnersley were widely advertised, and {{were one of the}} ways Franklin's lightning rod was demonstrated to the general public.|$|E
