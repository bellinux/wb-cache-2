40|$|A {{regionally}} organized {{program for}} serials bibliography is proposed be-cause {{of the large}} volume of complex data needing control and the many purposes to which the data can be put in support of regional or local needs. · The size of the data base comprising serials bibliography in the United States alone may exceed 2 million titles. Gregory's Union List of Serials rep-resents the largest single source of controlled titles- 450, 000 in the third edi-tion. 1 At a minimum its successor publication, New Serial Titles (NST), con-tains 325, 000 titles. 2 Therefore, some 775, 000 titles are under control for ·identification, interlibrary transfer, and location purposes [...] The data base requirements for the ISDS / NSDP record comprise sev-eral dozen fields. When added together with other information now found in a MARC serials record for cataloging purposes and when further cou-pled with explicit holdings information needed for regional networks, the file size would exceed 1 billion characters. Therefore, the systems design basis {{as well as the}} functional purposes of such data would encourage us 'to explore a regionally organized serials program. Another even more overwhelming factor which gives support to a re-gional system is the mixture of rules applied in cataloging. The NSDP data establish conclusive identity via the <b>key-title</b> without a full biblio-graphic record. However, libraries will not suddenly drop their local prac-tices or use of LC cataloging copy, affecting their internal arrangements of collections. Therefore, the most prudent course would seem to be reconcili-ation of past practice with the new system and development of a machine-readable serials record specification which accommodates the requirements of the ISDS / NSDP and the cataloging rules of present libraries. A region-ally organized program should be highly responsive to such a reconcilia-tion...|$|E
