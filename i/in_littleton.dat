25|$|In 1994, WMUR became both {{a primary}} and {{secondary}} affiliate of Fox in which they also launched 3 low-powered repeaters in the Northern portion of New Hampshire, one of them (W38CB <b>in</b> <b>Littleton)</b> carried WMUR's full ABC schedule, while the other two (W27BL in Berlin & WMUR-LP <b>in</b> <b>Littleton)</b> were full-time primary affiliates of Fox, all of them including its main channel carried WMUR's newscasts as well as FOX Sports telecasts. While WMUR and W38CB managed to retain its full-time ABC schedule, W27BL & WMUR-LP offered a different lineup than that of WMUR's actual lineup, even though W27BL & WMUR-LP retained WMUR's newscasts and syndicated fare, the ABC programs were replaced with more syndicated programming, including programs from Fox itself including FOX Sports telecasts, FOX News shows, the Fox Kids children's block, {{and of course the}} network's full primetime lineup. However on December 19, 2001, WMUR dropped its primary/secondary affiliation with Fox after the Hearst acquisition (Hearst has never affiliated any of their stations with Fox, a rarity in American broadcasting), and has since replaced the full Fox lineup on W27BL & WMUR-LP with a full-time simulcast of WMUR's ABC programming itself.|$|E

In 2012, this approach was challenged by a same-sex couple who got married in Texas in 2010 where they are considered a heterosexual couple under the ruling <b>in</b> <b>Littleton</b> v. Prange. Their petition was originally rejected by immigration, but in January 2013, in a non precedential decision, the Board of Immigration Appeals remanded the case back to USCIS with instructions to apply the rules set forth in In re Lovo-Lara, and determine whether the couple had a valid marriage under the laws of the State of Texas. The case was held up by USCIS until the US supreme court struck down Section 3 of DOMA in June 2013.|$|E

500|$|Marcel {{provided}} Warren with a filming slot on {{the wooded}} backlot of Shepperton Studios, {{located on the}} River Ash.

Of the filming arrangements, Warren comments: [...] "This really was quite a unique situation because ... here we were in a studio looking at a real house and real rooms as if shooting on location." [...] The crew were permitted to redecorate the rooms as necessary and, to this end, make use of any of the items in the studios' prop store. Warren states that this resulted in a [...] "crazy" [...] mixture of decors that [...] "certainly helped create the right atmosphere" [...] for the film.|$|E
500|$|The rioters <b>in</b> <b>Littleton</b> had in {{the interim}} stolen a wagon and horses from Henry Tansley and {{equipped}} it with fowling guns front and back. Most of the Littleton mob, armed with guns and pitch-forks, then began the march to Ely, arriving three-quarters of a mile (1.2km) {{north of the city}} between 5am and 6am on 23 May. The Reverend William Metcalfe met them, read the Riot Act, and asked what the mob required. On being told that they wanted [...] "the price of a stone of flour per day" [...] and that [...] "our children are starving, give us a living wage," [...] the Reverend agreed but stated {{that he would have to}} converse with the other magistrates. He asked everyone to return to Littleport, but they marched on. Metcalfe implored them to go to the market place and many did go there, where they were joined by Ely citizens. Recognising the needs of the rioters, the Ely magistrates, the Reverends William Metcalfe, Peploe Ward and Henry Law drafted a response, offering poor families two-shillings per head per week and ordering farmers to pay two-shillings (Â£) per day wages. On hearing the proclamation, the mob cheered. The magistrates then [...] "gave the men some beer, told them not to get drunk and tried to persuade them to go home". Some took the advice, whilst others continued the rampage, intimidating shopkeepers, millers and bankers and stealing from some. However, most of the rioters, marching with their wagons and guns, left the city for Littleport before the arrival of the military from Bury.|$|E
