5|$|According to his Life of King Alfred, Asser was a monk at St David's in {{what was}} then the kingdom of Dyfed, in {{south-west}} Wales. Asser makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was brought up in the area, and was tonsured, trained and ordained there. He also mentions Nobis, a bishop of St David's who died in 873 or 874, as being a kinsman of his.|$|E
5|$|Following his conviction, Brady {{was moved}} to Durham Prison, where he asked to live in solitary confinement. He spent 19 years in {{mainstream}} prisons before being diagnosed as a psychopath in November 1985 {{and sent to the}} high-security Park Lane Hospital, now Ashworth Psychiatric Hospital, in Sefton; he made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> never wanted to be released.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{became the}} first USC quarterback to leave school early for the NFL since Todd Marinovich did so after the 1990 season. During the press conference, head coach Pete Carroll made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not agree with}} Sanchez's decision, and advised him of the low success-rate of quarterbacks who left college early. Despite the public disagreement, the two {{remained}} close afterward.|$|E

5|$|The Colts {{placed their}} {{franchise}} tag on Manning on February 15, 2011. On July 30, 2011, the Colts signed Manning to a 5-year, $90 million contract after negotiations {{in which he}} made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{did not need to}} be the highest-paid player in the NFL.|$|E
5|$|Britten died of {{congestive}} heart failure on 4 December 1976. His funeral service was held at Aldeburgh Parish Church three days later, and he was buried in its churchyard, with a gravestone carved by Reynolds Stone. The authorities at Westminster Abbey had offered burial there, but Britten had made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wished his grave to be side by side with that, in due course, of Pears. A memorial service was held at the Abbey on 10 March 1977, at which the congregation was headed by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.|$|E
5|$|Sanders, a bachelor, died without {{knowledge}} of the award of a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his actions on 12 June 1917. The emergence of correspondence with his first Q-ship commander, A.D Blair, makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> at least knew of his VC prior to his death, {{even if he had}} not received it. In June 1918, Sanders' father received his son's VC and DSO from the Governor-General of New Zealand. Sander's VC, the only one awarded to a New Zealander serving in the navy, and DSO are on display at the Auckland War Memorial Museum.|$|E

5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) decides to pursue a career as a professional actor, and quits his job at Dunder Mifflin. Meanwhile, Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) finally receives his black belt in karate from his new sensei (Imperioli) and, on the recommendation of Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), is promoted to Regional Manager of the Scranton branch. Jim reconnects with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> will choose her over Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and {{what it would take}} for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would do whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
5|$|Free {{from any}} {{constitutional}} duties {{during the time}} between sessions, Chandler had begun laying the groundwork to succeed Laffoon as governor almost {{from the beginning of}} his term as lieutenant governor. Laffoon, however, had made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> favored Thomas Rhea to be his successor. Rhea secured the services of rising political boss Earle C. Clements as his campaign manager. Hailing from Morganfield, only a short distance from Chandler's hometown of Corydon, Clements later said that if Chandler had asked him first, he might have managed Chandler's campaign instead of Rhea's. Instead, by virtue of managing the opposing campaign, Clements became the leader of a Democratic faction that opposed Chandler for the next three decades.|$|E
50|$|Soon, Nate {{helps in}} the search and rescue of two lost {{mountain}} climbers, and asks for Meg's help in getting there. Upon their rescue, Nate also locates a frozen corpse, who {{turns out to be}} Meg's father. <b>It's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was murdered, as the axe used to kill him is still embedded in his body. Meg has trouble mourning for her father, because she has always been mad at him for abandoning his family.|$|R

5|$|In 1917, in {{response}} to the wave of anti-German feeling that surrounded the war, George V changed the family name from Saxe-Coburg and Gotha to Windsor. He also disposed of his family's German titles and styles, so Christian, Helena and their daughters simply became Prince and Princess Christian; Princess Helena Victoria and Marie Louise with no territorial designation. Helena's surviving son, Albert, fought {{on the side of the}} Prussians, though he made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not fight against his mother's country. In the same year, on 8 October, Prince Christian died at Schomberg House. Her last years were spent arguing with Commissioners, who tried to turn her out of Schomberg and Cumberland Lodge because of the expense of running her households. They failed, as clear evidence of her right to live in those residences for life was shown.|$|E
5|$|Not {{a regular}} speaker in the House, Watts Morgan busied himself with work on various committees, dealing mainly with gas, electricity, river pollution, the Home Office and the Police Council. Despite {{his work on}} private bills and his {{friendly}} relationship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald he was never considered for office. In the 1922 election, Watts Morgan was forced to contest his seat {{for the first time}} when he was challenged by Frederick William Heale. Watts Morgan made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would defend the interests of ex-servicemen and those injured in industry; he opposed the temperance demand for the local veto. It was a close result for a Rhondda election; Heale lost by just over 3,000votes. The 1923 election was a different affair, with Watts Morgan defeating Conservative candidate Alfred John Orchard by nearly 13,000votes.|$|E
5|$|The {{internal}} {{disputes between}} the McMahons led to Linda McMahon {{being in a}} comatose and wheel-chair bound state due to the stress of being asked for a divorce by Vince, who {{took the opportunity to}} have a public affair with Trish Stratus. McMahon briefly feuded with Stratus, defeating her at No Way Out. Over the next few weeks, Vince made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> favored McMahon over Stratus, allowing McMahon to bully and verbally abuse Stratus. At WrestleMania X-Seven, Shane McMahon defeated Vince in a street fight. During the match, Stratus slapped Vince and chased Stephanie from ringside, apparently upset with Vince's constant misogynistic treatment of her.|$|E
50|$|His famous jokes were {{available}} as three booklets but some pirated versions were also published. Currently, his jokes are popular over the Internet and several facebook pages. Most of these jokes are in Nepali, lingua franca of Darjeeling, Nepal and surrounding areas {{but many of}} them have been translated to English. In 1985 he was screened for about two minutes in a popular Nepali movie Kusume Rumal and <b>it</b> <b>cleared</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is not just an imaginary character.|$|R

5|$|There {{were also}} {{conflicts}} between the king and the Scots, whose church was ruled by a system of elected assemblies called presbyterianism. James, Charles's predecessor as King of Scotland, made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> intended to impose elements of episcopal church government and the Book of Common Prayer on the Scots beginning in 1604. The Scots considered this a reversion to Roman Catholicism. Charles furthered English impositions on the Church of Scotland in 1636 and 1637. This led to the First Bishops' War between Charles and the Scots in 1639. Charles called {{what came to be}} known as the Short Parliament to raise funds for the war, but he soon dissolved it when it began voicing opposition to his policies. Following the Second Bishops' War with the Scots in 1640, Charles was forced to call another parliament to raise additional funds.|$|E
5|$|Danilo Di Luca made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{aiming for}} the time bonuses {{available}} in this stage, both {{at the finish line}} and the intermediate sprint. As such, his team worked to bring the morning's breakaway back well {{before the end of the}} stage. Just as he had in the mountains, race leader Denis Menchov stayed right with Di Luca, and the two of them contested the intermediate sprint, with Di Luca's team trying to give him a successful leadout. They mistimed it, however, and Menchov was able to come around Di Luca and beat him to the line (Di Luca's teammate and accomplished sprinter Alessandro Petacchi managed to beat Menchov in the sprint to limit Di Luca's losses). Both Menchov and Di Luca got time bonuses, but Menchov got 4 for second in the sprint and Di Luca 2 for third, padding Menchov's lead in the overall classification.|$|E
5|$|In Stevenson's first {{message to}} the legislature, he called on legislators to finally decide whether the state capital would remain at Frankfort or be moved to Lexington or Louisville, as some had wanted. His address made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> favored keeping the capital at Frankfort, but he noted that {{additional}} space was needed at the present capitol building because the existing building could not continue to house enough room both the state treasurer and auditor. He laid out a vision for an addition to the capitol {{that would make it}} more spacious and more grandiose. To pay for the expansion, the fiscally conservative Stevenson pressed the federal government to pay claims due Kentucky from Civil War expenses. By the end of his term, the state had collected over $1.5 million in claims. The legislature, however, disregarded his plan for expanding the capitol, instead opting to construct a separate executive office building next to the capitol.|$|E

50|$|Carl {{comes into}} the apartment, armed and frightened for his own life; he owes {{dangerous}} drug dealers money and he's desperate. Even though <b>it's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> doesn't want to resort to such measures, Carl grabs Molly and holds his gun to her, telling Sam <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> doesn't have Oda Mae tell him where the money is, he's going to kill her. There's a struggle, and Carl is killed, and he's dragged away {{in the same way}} as Willie.|$|R
5000|$|Even {{longtime}} Snow critic Rick Anderson, {{who gave}} Murder Love a negative review, observed, “Snow's third album finds him slowly {{emerging from the}} sophomore slump of his underwhelming Murder Love, but still not delivering any hit singles to rival the success of [...] "Informer," [...] from his debut. By now <b>it's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{is more than just}} a novelty act, but he is still struggling to define a sound for himself that is something more than a hybrid of his influences.” ...|$|R
5|$|Long before {{working on}} Charlotte, Maeda had thought up a concept {{for a story}} with {{characters}} who have imperfect superpowers that must cooperate {{with each other to}} resolve any incidents that arise. Maeda originally submitted three separate ideas for a story to Toba, and he asked him which one he liked best. However, after Toba pointed out one of the other two, Maeda made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> wanted to do the story that would become Charlotte. When writing the story, Maeda also reconsidered how he had done certain things with Angel Beats!. In particular, he attempted to put more of a focus on the behavior of the characters. Maeda also narrowed down the number of main characters in Charlotte compared to Angel Beats!, which could not put a focus on each and every character. Toba felt that Maeda was influenced by his work on Angel Beats!, which changed his thought process and what he wanted to depict in Charlotte.|$|E
5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's {{home state of}} Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed had serious candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|Once again, the British {{government}} {{did not wish to}} entrust its interests in Japan to a foreign officer, so the British Chiefs of Staff appointed Air Vice Marshal Cecil Bouchier as their representative at MacArthur's headquarters. His brief made <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had no responsibility or authority over the BCOF or Commonwealth forces in Korea. After rashly ordering the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade to Pusan without transport or heavy equipment, much to Robertson's annoyance, Bouchier did attempt to confine himself to acting solely as a liaison officer. Following the dismissal of General Douglas MacArthur, Robertson held a press conference in which he defended the general and his conduct of the war. This constituted an implicit condemnation of the British government's policy. Soon after, during the Battle of the Imjin River, Robertson was consulted by the Americans about the possible consequences of the loss of the 1st Battalion, the Gloucestershire Regiment, and he advised them not to endanger the rest of the I Corps line with a rescue attempt. For his services in the Korean War, he was awarded the American Legion of Merit, and the South Korean Order of Military Merit.|$|E
5000|$|Robin goes {{cruising}} in {{the public}} toilets where he meets Julian (James Wilby). They both exchange knowing glances and are intending to enter one of the cubicles together, when they are interrupted. Robin leaves. He waits outside briefly, but doesn't see Julian come out. He heads to a dinner party being held by Roger (Tom Beard) and Belinda (Rachel Blake), where Roger makes <b>it</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he's</b> unhappy in his marriage and {{wants to be able}} to [...] "play the field again".|$|R
5000|$|Vincent Canby {{gave the}} film a mixed review, writing in The New York Times: [...] "Hard Choices is Mr. King's first {{dramatic}} feature and <b>it's</b> <b>clear</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has talent. Some of the film's crucial decisions (which, I assume, {{he had a}} hand in making) are fine, especially the casting, though others don't measure up. Totally unnecessary, and off-putting, is the use of overlapping dialogue, which is supposed to keep the film moving at a breathless pace but more often interrupts it." ...|$|R
