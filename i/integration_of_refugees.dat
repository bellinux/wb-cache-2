40|$|Sweden’s {{social and}} labor policy have been {{influenced}} by strong labor movements. The role of trade unions is of significance, when speaking <b>of</b> labor market <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> immigrants. This study aimed to examine how the Swedish Trade Union Confederation, LO, supports <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> immigrants on the Swedish labor market. Through semi-structured interviews with representatives from LO, reasons <b>of</b> exclusion <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> immigrants from the labor market, strategies to integrate refugee immigrants on the labor market and current policies regarding <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugee</b> immigrants, were investigated. The empirical data was analyzed using theoretical frameworks of social exclusion, empowerment and Esping-Andersen’s categorization of welfare state regimes. According to the LO representatives, refugee immigrants are excluded from the Swedish labor market due to reasons such as lack of language skills, discriminatory unemployment and segregated housing conditions. The results show that {{there is a lack of}} strategies used by LO to integrate refugee immigrants on the labor market, although elements of providing information and forms of influence for conscientizing and empowerment have been identified. Removing administrative barriers combined with protection of collective agreements and the solidary welfare state system are identified as important for a successful integration on the labor market. The findings are related to the shift of Sweden’s welfare state, from a universal to a more liberal one...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} {{the factors}} influencing return migration and subsequent <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> former <b>refugees</b> into the Liberian society. Based {{on interviews with}} more than 40 Liberian returnees conducted in Monrovia, Gbarnga and Zwedru in late 2013 I analyse the return migration and <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> former <b>refugees</b> in Liberia over the last decade. Understanding sustainability of return migration as primarily a matter <b>of</b> successful <b>integration</b> I analyse the various domains influencing the integration process. Compared to other studies on the topic I find significant and outspoken satisfaction with return. While some returnees are indeed facing severe hardship, fundamental rights, social networks, and emotional attachment made others willing to overlook significant issues with physical living conditions. I conclude that in an increasingly less accommodating world <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> return migration has for many Liberian refugees held the biggest promise of finding a sustainable and worthy life...|$|R

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study, {{based on}} interviews to 17 refugee families, attempts to identify the reasons behind the lack <b>of</b> <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> Colombian <b>refugees</b> in Costa Rica.

40|$|Abstract This project {{deals with}} the matter; {{integration}}. It is mainly about the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> in Denmark. However, our focus is on Frederiksberg Kommune as well as Venligboerne’s integration strategies, and how they affect the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees.</b> We will furthermore investigate whether or not Venligboerne {{has the potential to}} affect the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees</b> in Frederikberg Kommune and play a part in this. We will also describe the term integration in an historic context and also demonstrate the several political opinions there are of this term. Apart from this, we will examine Frederiksberg Kommune’s goals for the integration, and how they will accomplish these. There will also be a description of voluntary organizations and especially Venligboerne’s role in the <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees,</b> where we also study their goals for the integration and how they will accomplish these goals. Generally, we have been using the qualitative method, where we have been collecting data by interviewing refugees, volunteers as well as communal workers and more. On the other hand, we have also been using articles, statistics etc. In the conclusion we conclude which results we have achieved. Finally, we can conclude that the Venligboerne has potential because it contributes with social capital and among other things to refugees which Frederiksberg Kommune is not capable of doing as much...|$|E

This paper finds that refugees in Canada face severe barriers to economic integration, resulting in high unemployment and a concentration in precarious work. Exploring these issues reveals key limitations within Canadian policies, and the devastating consequences they have for Canadian refugees. Policy suggestions are made based on established international best practices on the economic <b>integration</b> <b>of</b> <b>refugees...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study uses a {{life history}} {{approach}} {{to understand the}} lived experiences of 40 Southeast Asian elderly refugees who fled from their home countries and resettled in the United States in the late 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s.

The results indicate that escapes: (a) are motivated by a multiplicity of overlapping factors; (b) appear {{to have an impact}} on health after resettlement; and (c) are complex events where the same generational cohort fleeing from the same conflict, during the same time period, may arrive in the same destination with very different levels of distress.
