40|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> (Cryptostegia grandiflora) is an {{environmental}} weed that frequently invades riparian habitats in northern Australia. I examined the habitat use of lizards in riparian and woodland environments comprised of native and <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> vegetation. <b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> {{was a major}} component of vegetation in the riparian habitat (approximately 40 %), but only a minor component of woodland habitat (approximately 5 %). Of 132 lizards, none were observed using <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> vegetation in riparian habitats, significantly less than expected, and only one lizard was observed in <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> vegetation in the woodland habitat. As <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> vegetation contains features that superficially resemble native habitat used by lizards, such as leaf litter, the avoidance of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> by lizards suggests that <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> has underlying characteristics that create a suboptimal environment for lizards...|$|R
5|$|The Abir Congo Company (founded as the Anglo-Belgian <b>India</b> <b>Rubber</b> Company {{and later}} {{known as the}} Compagnie du Congo Belge) was a company that {{exploited}} natural rubber in the Congo Free State, the private property of King Leopold II of Belgium. The company was founded with British and Belgian capital and was based in Belgium. By 1898 there were no longer any British shareholders and the Anglo-Belgian <b>India</b> <b>Rubber</b> Company {{changed its name to}} the Abir Congo Company and changed its residence for tax purposes to the Free State. The company was granted a large concession in the north of the country and the rights to tax the inhabitants. This tax was taken in the form of rubber obtained from a relatively rare <b>rubber</b> <b>vine.</b> The collection system revolved around a series of trade posts along the two main rivers in the concession. Each post was commanded by a European agent and manned with armed sentries to enforce taxation and punish any rebels.|$|R
40|$|Disturbances {{influence}} {{the structure of}} many ecosystems, determining environmental and biological heterogeneity. Human-mediated disturbances, including introduced plant species and fire, {{have the ability to}} alter ecosystem-level processes and properties, modify habitat structure and, as a consequence, influence faunal assemblages. This thesis examines the impacts of introduced plant species and fire management practices on vertebrate assemblages in grazed tropical savannas in northern Queensland. Invasive introduced plant species pose a major threat to native environments. <b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> (Cryptostegia grandiflora) is an environmental weed that invades native riparian habitats in northern Australia. Small ground-dwelling lizards may be negatively affected as <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> replaces and fragments native habitat. Field observations of reptiles in habitat invaded by <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> recorded only a single lizard in <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> vegetation, compared to 131 lizards in nearby native vegetation. As <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> vegetation contains features that superficially resemble native habitat, such as leaf litter, the avoidance of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> suggests that <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> has underlying characteristics that create a suboptimal environmental for lizards. Two species of native skinks (Carlia munda and C. pectoralis) and the invasive plant <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> were used as a model system to determine possible underlying mechanisms driving avoidance of non-native plants by fauna. In semi-natural enclosures, lizards discriminated between leaf litter types: 85...|$|R
40|$|The arutors {{studied the}} impact of a forage legume, {{butterfly}} pea, on <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> at the early establishment phase under seven planting combinations at three nitrogen fertiliser levels. In pure stands, both species increased their shoot and root dry weight yield in response to nitrogen but <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> exhibited the greater response. In mixed stands, <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> and butterfly pea did not compete with each other at any nitrogen level. An over-yielding response resulted in all mixture combinations in terms of shoot and root yields. Total shoot and root mass of mixed stands significantly out-yielded their highest yielding pure stands by 8 % and 27 % respectively, suggesting that butterfly pea not only failed to reduce shoot and root growth of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine,</b> but actually improved its growth performance. Consequently, the introduction of butterfly pea to suppress <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> is not warranted...|$|R

50|$|A <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> {{can grow}} up to 2 metres (m) tall as a shrub, but when it is {{supported}} on other vegetation as a vine, it can reach up to 30 metres in length. <b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> prefers areas where annual rainfall is between 400 and 1400 millimetres (mm), and is well adapted to a monsoonal climate. It can grow maximally on an annual rainfall of 1700 millimetres, but seeds best with an annual rainfall of 400 millimetres or less. For this reason, <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> thrives on (and requires) the extreme variability of rainfall and streamflow characteristic of central Queensland. The extreme variability (four times that of other countries to which it has been introduced) is almost certainly why <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> {{has become a major}} weed in Australia and not any other country in which it has been introduced.|$|R
5000|$|Control of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> {{has relied}} on {{importing}} biological agents from its native habitat in southwestern Madagascar, {{the most important of}} which is the [...] "rubber vine rust" [...] (Maravalia cryptostegiae). In some areas near Charters Towers, this rust has infected most <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> plants, but its effect has not been great enough {{to stop the spread of}} the plant westwards. The [...] "rubber vine moth" [...] (Euclasta whalleyi) was introduced earlier than the rust (in 1988) but has not proved very effective. The extreme remoteness of most <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> infestations rules out mechanical and chemical control for dealing with the plant.|$|R

40|$|Two {{herbicides}} (triclopyr/picloram (Grazon DS™) at 1. 05 / 0. 35 g a. i. /L, and metsulfuron (Brushoff TM) at 0. 09 g a. i. /L) were foliar {{applied to}} mature <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> (Cryptostegia grandiflora) plants {{growing in the}} field. Sprayed plants were infested with varying degrees (light, medium, and heavy) of rust (Maravalia cryptostegiae). Effective control of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> {{can be achieved by}} a number of methods, alone or in combination depending on the situation and the severity of the infestation. For optimum results when applying foliar herbicides (ground or aerially) to <b>rubber</b> <b>vine,</b> the plant needs to be uniformly lush, actively growing, and flowering. As plants become water stressed or defoliated, mortality from applied herbicides decreases. Two biocontrol agents (rust and moth (Euclasta gigantalis)) released by the Department of Natural Resources in Queensland are successfully established in the field. Both agents cause defoliation and fail to kill established <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> plants. The efficacy of foliar applied herbicides triclopyr/picloram and metsulfuron were significantly (P< 0. 05) affected by rust when compared to plants without rust. As rust infection level increased from light to heavy, plant mortality decreased, 65 to 41 % respectively. Triclopyr/picloram application killed more <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> plants (77 %) than metsulfuron (53 %). (Data from previous herbicide trials was used for plants with no rust, as all <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> in the field experiment was infected with rust to some degree.) High volume spraying of plants with a heavy rust infection level caused 10 to 15 % defoliation during herbicide application. Ground and aerially applied foliar herbicides must only be applied to <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> when the plants have little or no rust. Plants with a light rust infection level should be treated with triclopyr/picloram in preference to metsulfuron. Additives that will increase the efficacy on rust infected plants need to be evaluated. Until then alternative control options need to be selected for plants with a medium to high rust infection level...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> is {{believed}} to have a potential range in Australia from about Coen in Cape York Peninsula to Port Hedland in the Pilbara. It has not yet moved much beyond Queensland. It is a major threat to gallery forests along rivers in northern Australia, because it can strangle and kill the native trees by climbing over them and completely eliminating access to light. It can also do the same thing in savanna woodlands away from watercourses. <b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> is also extremely toxic to all livestock: less than 10 grams of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> leaves can kill a 400 kilogram horse within six days, and it is also highly toxic to cattle, sheep and goats. However, it is extremely unpalatable and only causes death in dry seasons when green grass is very scarce.|$|R

50|$|Seeds {{germinate}} {{after the}} first rains of the wet season, but growth does not become rapid until well after the wet season begins. However, if enough water is available, <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> can grow as much as five metres in one month. Flowering usually occurs after the wet season ends, along with fruit set. In the West Kimberley, plant growth accelerates before the first rains come, stimulated by higher pre-wet season humidity and flowering occurs early and during the wet season. It is usual to find both mature and immature fruit on <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> at any one time.|$|R

Local knowledge of biological invasions has proven beneficial for invasive species research, but to date no work has integrated this knowledge with species distribution modeling for invasion risk assessments. In this study, we integrated pastoral knowledge with Maxent modeling {{to assess the}} suitable habitat and potential impacts of invasive Cryptostegia grandiflora Robx. Ex R. Br. (<b>rubber</b> <b>vine)</b> in Ethiopia's Afar region. We conducted focus groups with seven villages across the Amibara and Awash-Fentale districts. Pastoral knowledge revealed the growing threat of <b>rubber</b> <b>vine,</b> which to date has received limited attention in Ethiopia, and whose presence in Afar was previously unknown to our team. <b>Rubber</b> <b>vine</b> occurrence points were collected in the field with pastoralists and processed in Maxent with MODIS-derived vegetation indices, topographic data, and anthropogenic variables. We tested model fit using a jackknife procedure and validated the final model with an independent occurrence data set collected through participatory mapping activities with pastoralists. A Multivariate Environmental Similarity Surface analysis revealed areas with novel environmental conditions for future targeted surveys. Model performance was evaluated using area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve (AUC) and showed good fit across the jackknife models (average AUC = 0. 80) and the final model (test AUC = 0. 96). Our results reveal the growing threat <b>rubber</b> <b>vine</b> poses to Afar, with suitable habitat extending downstream of its current known location in the middle Awash River basin. Local pastoral knowledge provided important context for its rapid expansion due to acute changes in seasonality and habitat alteration, in addition to threats posed to numerous endemic tree species that provide critical provisioning ecosystem services. This work demonstrates the utility of integrating local ecological knowledge with species distribution modeling for early detection and targeted surveying of recently established invasive species...|$|R
