40|$|Maize landraces {{represent}} {{potential sources}} of favorable traits for current and future breeding programs [...] A comparative characterization of twenty-one flint maize landraces from Maize Research Institute "Zemun Polje“ gene bank was achieved by using morphological traits and SSR markers. Applied marker systems revealed high level of <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogenity</b> beetween landraces. Cluster analysis of the tested genotypes was based on average values of eighteen observed phenotypic traits. Ten SSR probes revealed total of 68 alleles. Genetic distance between pairs of landraces ranged from 0. 05 up to 0. 98. Cluster analysis of morphological and SSR markers distances did not exhibited the same grouping of accessions. Individual application of marker systems did not confirm differentiation of certain landraces into a particular agro-ecological group, as was expected according to their origin data. The best way for achieving the most accurate assessment of genetic diversity should comprise parallel application of both approaches...|$|E
40|$|Há vários tipos de hemoglobinopatias que são caracterizados por variantes das hemoglobinas anormais (ex: Hb S, Hb C, Hb Instáveis,etc) e por talassemias (ex: tal. alfa, tal. beta, tal. beta/delta,etc) As hemoglobinopatias são consideradas como uma das doenças genéticas mais comuns em todo o mundo, com prevalência de portadores heterozigotos de seus principais tipos em aproximadamente 5 % da população mundial. Devido à heterogenidade clínica e genética dessas alterações genéticas é {{fundamental}} estabelecer a investigação laboratorial das diferentes formas de hemoglobinas variantes e de talassemias. Este artigo apresenta as principais dificuldades laboratoriais que envolvem a complexidade molecular das hemoglobinopatias. There {{are various}} types of hemoglobinopathies that are characterized by variants of abnormal hemoglobins (eg. Hb S, HbC, unstables Hb, etc.) and thalassemias (eg. alpha, beta, beta/delta, etc.). Hemoglobinopathies account {{for some of the}} most common single gene disorders worldwide with at least 5 % of the world's population having one or more serious genetic abnormalities. Because of the clinical and <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogenity</b> of these disorders, a laboratory investigation is fundamental to establish the diagnosis of the different variants of the abnormal hemoglobinopathies and thalassemias. This article reports on the laboratory diagnostic difficulties caused by molecular complexity of these abnormalities...|$|E
40|$|Longterm {{climate changes}} are an inseparable {{part of the}} {{evolution}} of Earth. In the last few milions of years the changing of glacials and interglacials was as ordinary and regular phenomenon as changing from day to night or from spring to summer. These cycles also have similar influance on evolution of nature on Earth. Eventhough the state of nature appears to us stable for the few last human generations, the reality from the long term point of view is differnt. During these cycles, the location of climatic zones, size of glaciers, deserts, savannahs, steppes or rainforests have changed. Organisms changed locations of their areas of distribution, many nowadays widespread species were pushed into isolated local populations. This Master's thesis reveals the impact of glacial cycles on a freshwater crustacean aquatic Isopod (Asellus aquaticus). Very variable mitochondrial COI gene was sequenced within 139 individuals of this species from 62 different localities in Europe. This data were included into an extensive scope of an already known phylogeographic structure of the continent. An Aquatic Sowbug shows a quite high rate of a <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogenity</b> (maximum Nucleotide Divergence discovered is 0, 132 and average is 0, 016) {{in the area of the}} Czech Republic. Where there are found representatives of two [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Implication {{for health}} policy/practice/research/medical education: This study investigates {{the role of}} <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogenity</b> of {{hepatitis}} C virus in IFn resistance and detected 2 new genotypes 4 a and 6 e in Paki-stani population. Besides this an alternative therapeutic tool siRnA is presented to be used against HCV instead of IFn. This research work will be informative and useful {{for those who are}} involved in medical prevention and therapy to chronic hepatitis C. Background: Global prevalence of Hepatitis C Virus (HCV) infection corresponds to about 130 million HCV positive patients worldwide. The only drug that effectively reduc-es viral load is interferon-α (IFn-α) and currently combination of IFn and ribavirin is the choice for treatment. Objectives: The present study is aimed to resolve the genotypes based on core gene that might affect the response to interferon therapy. Furthermore an attempt was made to propose a powerful therapeutic approach by designing the siRnA from sequences of the same patients who remain resistant to IFn in this study. Patients and Methods: To achieve the objectives, a sequence analysis was performed in five HCV eLISA positive subjects who have completed IFn treatment. neighbor Joining (nJ) method was used to study the evolutionary relationship. Atomic models were pre...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Kartagener's (or Siewert) {{syndrome}} {{represents a}} clinical presentation of primary ciliary diskinesia (PCD) with 3 dominant symptoms: bronchiectasiae, chronic sinusitis and situs viscerum inversus totalis or dextrocardia, only. Siewet demonstrated {{the first case}} of this clinical phenomenon in 1904, which was recognized by Kartagener in 1933, as a congenital disorder. PCD is an autosomal recessive disease with extensive <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogenity.</b> Dyskinetic or completely absent motility of cilia predisposes to reccurent pulmonary and upper respiratory tract infections resulting in bronchiestasis. Also, infections {{of the middle ear}} are common due to lack of ciliary movement in the Eustachian tube. Men have reduced fertility due to spermatozoa with absent motility or abnormalities in the ductuli afferents. Case report Our case report represents a middle age woman, treated ambulatory for many years as a chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). The patient noted recurrent upper respiratory tract infections from her childhood, headaches and recurrent sinusitis. Also, she had extrauterine pregnancy, no children, in spite of several arteficial inseminations. Due to the clinical signs of the right heart failure and the described ECG changes, the echocardiographic examination was done, which showed the dextracardia and the ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen revealed the situs inversus, the finding being within the physiological limits. Conclusion All data regarding situs viscerum invesrus, supported by CT verification of bronchiectasiae and chronic inflammation of maxillar sinus led us to conclude that the patient suffered from Kartagener's syndrome...|$|E
40|$|Species of {{the genus}} Bartonella are {{currently}} recognized in growing numbers and are involved in an increasing variety of human diseases, mainly trench fever, Carrion's disease, bacillary angiomatosis, endocarditis, cat scratch disease, neuroretinitis, and asymptomatic bacteremia. Such {{a wide spectrum of}} infections makes it necessary to develop species and strain identification tools in order to perform phylogenetic and epidemiological studies. The 16 S/ 23 S rRNA intergenic spacer region (ITS) was sequenced for four previously untested species, B. vinsonii subsp. arupensis, B. tribocorum, B. alsatica, and B. koehlerae, as well as for 28 human isolates of B. quintana (most of them from French homeless people), six human or cat isolates of B. henselae, five cat isolates of B. clarridgeiae, and four human isolates of B. bacilliformis. Phylogenetic trees inferred from full ITS sequences of the 14 recognized Bartonella species using parsimony and distance methods revealed high statistical support, as bootstrap values were higher than those observed with other tested genes. Five well-supported lineages were identified within the genus and the proposed phylogenetic organization was consistent with that resulting from protein-encoding gene sequence comparisons. The ITS-derived phylogeny appears, therefore, to be a useful tool for investigating the evolutionary relationships of Bartonella species and to identify Bartonella species. Further, partial ITS amplification and sequencing offers a sensitive means of intraspecies differentiation of B. henselae, B. clarridgeiae, and B. bacilliformis isolates, as each strain had a specific sequence. The usefulness of this approach in epidemiological investigations should be highlighted. Among B. quintana strains, however, the <b>genetic</b> <b>heterogenity</b> was low, as only three ITS genotypes were identified. It was nevertheless sufficient to show that the B. quintana population infecting homeless people in France was not clonal...|$|E
