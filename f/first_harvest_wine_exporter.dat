Recent papers have suggested that relationship-marketing approaches may be the most successful for establishing wine sales in these markets.

This research reports on the experience of one firm in Asia, and identifies the link between cultural values and the need for relationship based strategies for <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> to Asia.

40|$|China {{is one of}} the {{fastest-growing}} wine markets in the world. Wine businesses from major wine-producing countries have been focusing on this market. New Zealand, as the fastest growing wine producer in the New World countries, has targeted East Asia, especially China, as an export destination. However, the market share and reputation of New Zealand wines has not been very high and many New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> have neither understood the Chinese market very well, nor successfully set up their export business there. The findings of this study will inform current and potential <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> from New Zealand of effective market entry procedures. A qualitative methodology was employed to identify the key elements of exporting New Zealand wine to China. Fourteen businesses, including eleven New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> and three China-based wine import distributors were interviewed. The data was analysed using qualitative data methods. The study found that New Zealand <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> have used four market entry modes, chosen according to the different characteristics of their businesses: indirect exporting, direct exporting, joint venture, and acquisition. This study also identified key elements in successfully exporting New Zealand wine to China, including the selection of market entry modes, distribution channels, and suitable importer/distributors, the initial organisation of the wine export process, and the development of business relationships. Challenges to this success have also been identified, such as the current Chinese preference for red wines, the small scale of the New Zealand wine industry, the orientation towards short-term profit by Chinese traders, and identifying suitable business partners. Recommendations are also made for the development of successful export business by New Zealand wine producers in the future. Key words: market entry, wine export, China wine market...|$|R

40|$|International {{wine market}} is {{becoming}} one of the more dynamic in beverages sector. This paper is a summary of the research developed during 2004 - 2006 at the UPM with Argentinean exporters. The selection of UK market was due to the high degree of competition between international wines: European, American, Australian and others. Secondary information was collected from EU and Argentina publication and data bases. Primary information was obtained through face to face interviews with the main stakeholders and <b>wine</b> <b>exporter</b> entrepreneurs. UK <b>wine</b> market {{is one of the more}} competitive in the world and the main destinations of Argentinean exports. The presentation describes the strengths and weaknesses of the more significant <b>wine</b> <b>exporters</b> with a SWOT matrix analysis. Argentina has comparative advantages in wine production but the main problem is the wine network exporting performance. The challenge is how to design adequate strategies, involving public and private national resources and get adequate quota market in the coming future. Some specific recommendations are related to: Firms and country commercial brands, relationship exporters-UK retailers, trade brands shared by producers and commercial agents, promotion and publicity of Argentinean wines in UK. Other scenarios of future development are the improvement of firm strategic alliances, rising added value in the <b>wine</b> chain for <b>exporters</b> and communication programs with UK society.

The craftsmanship and building skills of workers and builders from this region were appreciated in the former Yugoslavia and its surrounding neighbours until the Yugoslav Wars.|$|R
50|$|The Verduzzo vine {{tends to}} thrive on {{hillside}} vineyard locations that have good {{exposure to the}} sun which gives this mid to late-ripening variety ample time to achieve full physiological ripeness.

50|$|Terminology for {{different}} levels of late <b>harvest</b> <b>wines,</b> based on grape selection, were then introduced starting with Auslese ("Select harvest") being introduced in 1787, and additional levels added later.
