5|$|The four tenders {{resulting}} from the study were submitted during October and November 1986. Although the IKL/HDW design was rated highest during the <b>initial</b> <b>inspection,</b> the evaluation team found that the German proposal was less attractive than previously thought. Although IKL/HDW claimed that their boat could meet the RAN's performance requirements, the evaluators concluded from the information provided that doing so would require the deactivation of all non-essential and some essential systems. Conversely, Kockums' proposal conceded {{that they did not}} meet the requirements, although evaluators found that the figures failed by only narrow margins, and believed that these were conservative. The evaluation team recalculated the capability statistics for both submarines to a common baseline, portraying the predicted Australian operating conditions, which generally saw Kockums' figures revised upwards, and those from IKL/HDW downwards. This resulted in growing support for the Type471 bid, and outcries from the IKL and HDW groups, who questioned the validity of the recalculations and if the Australian evaluators had the experience to do this correctly.|$|E
5|$|McConnel {{set about}} {{improving}} Bryn Eglwys {{to increase its}} output. He focused on providing rail transport for the isolated quarry, and in April 1864 he reached agreement with local landowners to purchase the land necessary to build a railway towards Tywyn and onwards to the port of Aberdyfi. Construction was well underway by July 1864. The standard gauge Aberystwyth and Welsh Coast Railway was expanding rapidly from its base at Machynlleth, however, and in 1863 had reached Tywyn, so McConnel decided to build his line from the quarry to Tywyn, as the nearest point where slate could {{be transferred to the}} standard gauge railway. This was despite the line's initial isolation {{from the rest of the}} system because of difficulties in bridging the estuary of the Afon Dyfi to the south. An Act of Parliament (28 and 29Vict, cap cccxv) allowing the company to operate passenger trains as a public railway was given Royal Assent on 5 July 1865, and the company appointed James Swinton Spooner as engineer for the construction. He laid out plans for a relatively straight line climbing steadily from Tywyn to the quarry and work quickly got underway. By September 1866 construction had advanced to the point where the Board of Trade inspector Captain Henry Tyler could make an <b>initial</b> <b>inspection</b> and report.|$|E
5|$|On March20, the {{government}} of Madagascar appealed {{to the international community}} for assistance, due to the heavy damage from the cyclone. In response to the request, various governments and international organizations provided assistance to Madagascar, including $490,000 from the European Economic Community for food and blankets, as well as $125,000 from UNICEF for medicine and building supplies. Catholic Relief Services donated clothing, rice, and milk from Caritas Madagascar. Countries that provided assistance included China, France, the United Kingdom, the United States, West Germany, Holy See, Mauritius, Canada, Finland, New Zealand, Norway, Sweden, Soviet Union, and Switzerland. Collectively, the international community provided $3.37million worth of aid to Madagascar. The United States Pacific Command flew from the Philippines to Madagascar to deliver medicine. The nation had earlier helped Madagascar recover from Cyclone Kamisy in 1984 with housing rebuilding projects, and transferred materials due to the impacts from Honorinina to the Toamasina area. The Malagasy government also set up a National Relief Committee to facilitate relief efforts, including an <b>initial</b> <b>inspection</b> of the affected area to determine needs. Workers delivered about 19tons of material to Toamasina and nearby Brickaville, including milk, blankets, and clothing. The World Bank estimated the cost for repairing commercial areas would be over $27million (1986USD). The agency also allocated funds toward repairing damaged power facilities, ports, roads, and airports. The International Monetary Fund also approved a $37.8million loan to the country in 1986, half of which for emergency aid. Many houses and buildings had to be closed for repairs due to flood damage, including hotels, churches, and schools.|$|E

On his <b>initial</b> <b>inspection</b> of the Indus Valley sites of Mohenjo-daro and Harappa, he organised a very brief excavation which revealed fortifications around both settlements.

2500|$|The South Holland Drainage District was {{established}} by an Act of Parliament obtained in 1793.
