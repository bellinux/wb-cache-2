She performed the song {{dressed in a}} bodysuit and was backed by a clip. In {{a review of the}} performance, Nadeska Alexis felt that the singer managed to emphasize [...] "the weight of... lyrics" [...] while performing the song. Writing for Fuse, Hilary Hughes concluded that the rendition of the song was [...] "enough to halt all conversation, silence all phones and pause the internet for a moment, as she <b>got</b> <b>real</b> right off the bat".|$|E

[...] Before meeting her, {{he said that he had}} {{pictures}} of her all over his room. He recalled his happiness when they first met in 1981. He was at the 53rd Academy Awards with Diana Ross, and Shields walked up and introduced herself; then at the after-party she asked him to dance with her. They exchanged numbers, and he [...] "was up all night, singing, spinning around my room, just so happy." [...] He also said, “We had one encounter when she <b>got</b> <b>real</b> intimate and I chickened out. And I shouldn’t have.” ...|$|E

[...] Written in archaic English, {{reminiscent}} of the King James Bible translation, it contains parts of Samson's Season 1 prologue, mentions the Avatara, and alludes to an apocalyptic passage in the Book of Revelation. It also contains etchings of a gnarled and bent tree, which in one image is attacked by a Knight Templar holding a knife. Wilfred Talbot Smith interprets this book to Brother Justin, quoting, [...] "By {{the hand of the}} Prince, the Prophet dies. Upon his death, the Prince shall rise," [...] and [...] " [...] Anointed dagger plunge thee deep." [...] Management and Ben repeat these verses independently of Smith.|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Lindsay Doran, the new {{president}} of production company Mirage Enterprises, was on a company retreat brainstorming potential film ideas when she suggested the Jane Austen novel Sense and Sensibility to her colleagues. It had been adapted three times, most recently in a 1981 television serial. Doran was a longtime fan of the novel, and had vowed in her youth to adapt it if she ever entered the film industry. She chose to adapt this particular Austen work because there were two female leads. Doran stated that [...] "all of [...] books are funny and emotional, but Sense and Sensibility is the best movie story because it's full of twists and turns. Just when you think you know what's going on, everything is different. It's <b>got</b> <b>real</b> suspense, but it's not a thriller. Irresistible." [...] She also praised the novel for possessing [...] "wonderful characters... three strong love stories, surprising plot twists, good jokes, relevant themes, and a heart-stopping ending." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, I have <b>got</b> <b>real</b> empathy with Rachel." [...] However, Observer television reviewer Kathryn Flett criticised the plot as unrealistic: ...|$|E

In a March 28 interview with DJ Felli Fel of Power 106 in Los Angeles, Wayne said that he suffers from epilepsy, a neurological condition which is noted by seizures. He would say [...] "This isn't my first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth or seventh seizure. I've had a bunch of seizures. Y'all just never hear about them.

According to Robert Janjigian of the Palm Beach Daily News, Palm Beach were [...] "star-struck" [...] and [...] "ready for its close-up" [...] during filming. Variety noted that locals were also [...] "shook up" [...] by helicopters, firetrucks and marine patrol boats, [...] "bringing big-time filmmaking to an area better known for leisure-time activities." [...] Cinematographer J. Michael Muro shot the film with Red Epic digital cameras and Hawk V-Lite anamorphic lenses.|$|E
2500|$|Wong {{reportedly}} {{trained in}} several martial art styles in his youth, primarily in Tai Chi and either boxing or kickboxing. He abandoned boxing because of two incidents: one with his boxing coach {{and one with}} Ip Man. The first incident apparently occurred because Wong accidentally struck his boxing coach during sparring. The angry coach attacked in earnest, only to be eventually knocked out by Wong; the incident caused Wong to leave boxing. In another account, however, Wong said he had defeated his boxing coach with wing chun techniques: [...] "I was sparring with my instructor and I hit him very hard, he <b>got</b> <b>real</b> mad and came at me very hard. I fought back with wing chun {{and he ended up}} bleeding. Boxing was over for me!" ...|$|E

I was sitting there like, [...] "No the fuck this nigga did not....." [...] I was talking to people, but I was really talking to myself out loud, just in a state of shock. Before I even realized what I was doing, I headed back over to him, but this time I was blacking out with anger. The next thing I knew, all hell had broken loose in the club. That night the guy went straight to the police and I was indicted...|$|E
2500|$|Australia {{ended the}} day with 400/5 from 90 overs, and Ponting was unbeaten on 176, his 19th test hundred and his fifth for the year 2003, a {{remarkable}} year for him {{in which he had}} hitherto scored 1149 runs at an average of 95.75, and had set his sights for a double century. His innings was exceptional. For his first 100 runs, he picked boundaries in the gaps on the off-side, {{in spite of the fact}} that that region was packed with fielders. He raced on to his 100 from just 117 balls, but slowed down considerably, once he reached his 150. He commented about his innings, admitting that he was satisfied with the way he played on that day. He said, [...] "It was a good wicket, and a good outfield, and you <b>got</b> <b>real</b> value for your strokes." [...] He commented of the Indian bowlers that, [...] "They missed Zaheer...He's been their best bowler the past couple of years, and he bowled well up in Brisbane. They didn't bowl as well as they'd have liked today, but you can't judge them based on that." [...] Ponting's crisp strokeplay combined with aggression to produce a fantastic knock. However, he was aided by the fact that Ganguly got rid of the 8–1 and 7–2 fields thereby [...] depriving his bowlers the chance of getting lbws or any catches.|$|E
2500|$|In {{his search}} for radio work {{following}} his graduation, Stern declined an offer to work evenings at WRNW, a progressive rock station in Briarcliff Manor, New York. He stopped and was unsure of his talent and questioned his future as a professional in the industry, writing [...] "I freaked out. I <b>got</b> <b>real</b> nervous that I wasn't good enough". Stern accepted a marketing role at Benton & Bowles, a New York advertising agency, which he soon [...] "quit without giving notice" [...] {{in favor of a}} position in the creative department. He lasted three hours before he was fired [...] "because their personnel department realized that I was the guy who just quit." [...] Stern then worked in Queens as a radio salesman selling advertising time without considerable success. He wrote, [...] "All of a sudden ... I realized I had turned down a job in radio". With encouragement from his mother and girlfriend, Stern contacted WRNW for work and agreed to take cover shifts surrounding the Christmas holidays in 1976. Impressed with his reliability and professional approach, the station's director hired Stern full-time for a four-hour midday shift for six days a week, for $96 a week. After several months, Stern became the station's production director which lasted until November 1977 when he became its program director for an increased salary of $250 a week. To save money, Stern rented a room in a monastery in Armonk, New York.|$|E

2500|$|Following his {{appearance}} in the second season, Dane returned to the series in this episode. According to Dane, he was originally hired by the series producers in order to film one episode, but was ultimately asked to return. [...] "As far as I know, I was doing one episode. That's what I signed up for. But because of who the character was, {{there was a lot}} of room for him to come back. I <b>got</b> <b>real</b> lucky, they invited me back." [...] When offered the series regular position, Dane was not aware of the character's future on the show, noting the boldness of the character's introduction in the previous season, by contrast to his first {{appearance in the}} third season. Fellow cast member Pompeo offered her insight on Sloan's reintroduction, noting that the inevitability of the character's return was due to his overwhelming popularity, mainly among the female audience, who immediately responded to the concept of the character. Dane only makes a short, uncredited appearance in the episode, seeing his naked character exiting a steamy bathroom. The scene has become one of the most iconic of the series. Dane offered his outlook on the scene, [...] "It was a spectacular entrance. It was all about this brand new towel, which had a hard time staying together. Every time I put it together and let my hands go, it was almost like throwing caution to the wind." ...|$|E
2500|$|J. Cole {{announced}} a release date of January 28, 2013, (his birthday) {{along with the}} album name on November 9, 2012. In early January the album was included on multiple [...] "Most Anticipated Albums of 2013" [...] such as MTV and XXL ranked Born Sinner the sixth most anticipated album of 2013. After describing the January release date as ambitious, he would announce on New Years Day 2013 that the album would be coming out at a later date. On February 22, 2013, J. Cole said that the album should arrive around June 2013. He later would confirm a release month for June, and then on April 8, 2013, J. Cole announced via Twitter that the album would be released on June 25, 2013. Interesting enough, that date {{would have been the}} seventeenth year anniversary of the release of Jay-Z's debut album Reasonable Doubt. However, he announced on May 20, 2013, via his Twitter account that he would move the release up one week to June 18, 2013. He later revealed that he moved up the release date to coincide with the release of Kanye West's album Yeezus, saying [...] "Instantly the lightbulb … it <b>got</b> <b>real.</b> I was like, 'Yo…' The idea hit me instantly: 'You got to go to that date. I'm not going to sit … I worked too hard to come a week later after Kanye West drops an amazing album. It'd be like, 'Oh and J. Cole dropped too, a week later.' Nah. I'm going to go see him on that date. He's the greatest. So it's like, I'm a competitor by nature so it was instant, it wasn't even a thought." ...|$|E
