40|$|This paper deals {{mainly with}} {{the choice of the}} <b>granulometric</b> <b>dispersion</b> of the solid fuel and of the bed {{material}} of a fluid bed combustor. As theoretical predictions or extrapolations are rather difficult from one bed size to another and even more from a kind of fuel to another one, experimental techniques are described that allow the determination of the needed parameters for heat and mass balance calculations, for including in a mathematical model or for setting of the parameters of a control loop. Special emphasis would be given to demixing (segregation) of the fuel elements from the main bed material and to elutriation. SCOPUS: bk. binfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
