30|$|The {{migration}} of nanopore <b>edge</b> <b>material</b> {{is based on}} the principle of the nanopore surface energy minimum, which was proposed by Dekker group [47]. That is, when the nanopore diameter is smaller than the nanopore thickness, nanopore will be shrunk irradiated by high-energy electron beam. Based on the research of Dekker, Storm et al. [48] in situ observed that the minimum diameter of the silicon oxide nanopore was shrunk to 2  nm after irradiated by the electron beam (Fig.  4 b). This experimental result further confirmed nanopore surface energy minimum principle. In addition, the energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX) and electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) also confirm that the decrease of nanopore diameter was resulted from the {{migration of}} the nanopore <b>edge</b> <b>material,</b> instead of caused by nanopore surface contamination [9]. The principle of nanopore surface energy minimum is verified in different morphologies of silicon oxide nanopore, such as elliptical silicon oxide nanopore and silicon nitride/silica composite nanopore [49].|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we will give}} an {{overview}} {{on the results of}} a research project dedicated to the analysis of rotor forcing due to in-service trailing edge damage of high pressure turbine nozzle guide vanes (HPT NGVs). Due to the extremely high temperatures in this region of the engine, which on average exceed the melting temperature of the employed vane material by several hundred degrees during takeoff, any unintended decrease of the vane cooling mass flow can lead to a loss of trailing <b>edge</b> <b>material.</b> The structure of the NGV can withstand a significant amount of trailing <b>edge</b> <b>material</b> loss, but the damage changes the flow through the affected passage, causing a so-called low engine order excitation of the rotor blades downstream. This can lead –in extreme cases– to high cycle fatigue failure of the rotor blade caused by resonances in the operating range. Thus {{it is very important to}} be able to quantify the damage-induced rotor forcing in case a trailing edge damage is detected during routine engine inspection. This quantification can be obtained by solving the unsteady fluid flow, typically modeled using the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes equations together with a suitable turbulence model. In order to gain confidence in the CFD analysis results for those configurations, a dedicated measurement campaign with different representative trailing edge damage shapes has been set up at the DLR Göttingen, including both steady, unsteady and pressure-sensitive paint measurements and on both stationary and rotating components. The results of those measurements together with post-test CFD simulations will be presented in this paper...|$|E

Nonetheless, in order to analyze FGMS in an efficient manner, the homogenization schemes are needed to be simplified from their complicated heterogeneous microstructures. Closed-form solutions of some fundamental solid mechanics' problems can be obtained by this idealization.

This report describes a three-year research project aiming to identify the key processes of ageing related to the usefulness of by-products in roads; investigate the consequences of these processes for technical and environmental properties of the by-products, and propose a method for accelerated ageing to predict long-term properties. The project has compared naturally aged samples of two by-products used as sub-bases in existing asphalt paved roads with samples of fresh by-products from producers' piles. Steel slag of electric arc furnace type and municipal solid waste incinerator (MSWI) bottom ash were chosen.

High speed rub interaction tests were conducted using a representative knife edge and seal geometry over a broad range of interaction rates. Alternative materials were also experimentally evaluated. These tests provide information which can be used to design improved labyrinth seals for the HPFP of the SSME. In particular, plasma-sprayed aluminum-graphite was found to be significantly better than aluminum alloy seals used at present from the standpoint of rub performance.

40|$|We present three {{dimensional}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) {{calculations of}} warped accretion discs in X-ray binary systems. Geometrically thin, optically thick accretion discs are illuminated by a central radiation source. This illumination exerts a non-axisymmetric radiation {{pressure on the}} surface of the disc resulting in a torque that acts on the disc to induce a twist or warp. Initially planar discs are unstable to warping driven by the radiation torque and in general the warps also precess in a retrograde direction relative to the orbital flow. We simulate a number of X-ray binary systems which have different mass ratios using a number of different luminosities for each. Radiation-driven warping occurs for all systems simulated. For mass ratios q ~ 0. 1 a moderate warp occurs in the inner disc while the outer disc remains in the orbital plane (c. f. X 1916 - 053).

40|$|The {{results of}} a new {{multispectral}} infrared retrieval scheme for obtaining fractional cloud cover and 11 micrometer emissivity {{with those of the}} spatial coherence method which obtains fractional cloud cover assuming that the clouds are opaque at infrared wavelengths. Both methods are applied to 4 -km NOAA advanced very high resolution radiometer global area coverage data for 250 -km-scale regions containing single-layered marine stratocumulus off the coast of South America. The average 11 micrometer emissivity for low level clouds is found to be between 0. 70 and 0. 85. The low emissivity is evidently due to the thinning of clouds at their edges. Semitransparent cloud edges evidently make up {{a substantial portion of the}} area covered by such clouds. This result indicates that cloud cover obtained using the spatial coherence method is underestimated by 0. 1 to 0. 2, as has been claimed in a previous study. The fractional cloud cover for the ensemble of 250 -km-scale regions studied here increased slightly from 0. 60 for daytime observations to 0. 63 for nighttime observations. The 11 micrometer emissivity also increased slightly, but about half of the increase was related to the increase in cloud cover and a decrease in the relative area covered by cloud <b>edge</b> <b>material.</b> Presumably, the other half was due to an increase in cloud liquid water.

40|$|Along the Galápagos Spreading Center (GSC), 3 He/ 4 He {{varies from}} 8. 5 – 5. 9 RA. High 3 He/ 4 He ratios, {{resembling}} {{those in the}} western and southern Galápagos islands, are absent. This lack of high 3 He/ 4 He contrasts markedly with other localities of plume–ridge interaction, such as Iceland, Easter, and Amsterdam/St. Paul. The most striking feature is a 3 He/ 4 He gradient, decreasing westward from 8. 4 – 7. 0 RA between 89 and 93 °W, where the GSC is shallowest and shows “axial high” morphology. The intra-segment 3 He/ 4 He variability within this region indicates that magma crosses the mantle/crust boundary at multiple points beneath individual ridge segments, and lateral mixing within the crust and upper mantle is limited. Some of the 3 He/ 4 He variability may also reflect transfer of discrete heterogeneity from beneath the northern sector of the Galápagos plateau. One {{possible explanation for the}} absence of high 3 He/ 4 He along the GSC is that helium is a relatively ineffective downstream tracer of mantle material from the core of the Galápagos plume, due to its preferential extraction beneath the archipelago compared to other incompatible, lithophile tracers. A second explanation is that the heterogeneous Galápagos plume is sheared in the upper mantle by motion of the Nazca Plate relative to the migrating GSC. In this case, plume core material having high 3 He/ 4 He (from beneath Fernandina and Isabela) would be dispersed mostly away from the ridge, while plume <b>edge</b> <b>material</b> having low 3 He/ 4 He plus enriched Sr and Pb isotope signatures (from beneath the northern periphery of the archipelago) is smeared into the sub-ridge mantle...|$|E

For the next several months, an extensive investigation of the accident ensued involving a nationwide team of experts from NASA, industry, and academia, spanning dozens of technical disciplines. The Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), a group of experts assembled to conduct an investigation independent of NASA, concluded in August, 2003 that the most likely cause {{of the loss of}} Columbia and its crew was a breach in the left wing leading edge Reinforced Carbon-Carbon (RCC) thermal protection system initiated by the impact of thermal insulating foam that had separated from the orbiters external fuel tank 81 seconds into the mission's launch. During reentry, this breach allowed superheated air to penetrate behind the leading edge and erode the aluminum structure of left wing, which ultimately led to the breakup of the orbiter. The findings of the CAIB were supported by ballistic impact tests, which simulated the physics of External Tank Foam impact on the RCC wing leading <b>edge</b> <b>material.</b> These tests ranged from fundamental material characterization tests to full-scale Orbiter Wing Leading Edge tests. Following the accident investigation, NASA spent the next 18 months focused on returning the shuttle safely to flight.
