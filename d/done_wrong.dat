5|$|The series {{follows a}} tragic course in which Dream, having {{learned a great}} deal from his imprisonment, tries to correct the things he has <b>done</b> <b>wrong</b> in the past. Ultimately, this causes him to mercy kill his own son, which leads to his own death {{at the hands of the}} Furies. Dream, having found himself a {{replacement}} early on in Daniel Hall, dies in issue No. 69 (July 1995). The remaining issues deal with Dream's funeral, Hob Gadling choosing to remain immortal in spite of Dream's death, and two stories from the past. The series wraps with the story of William Shakespeare creating his other commission for Dream, The Tempest, his last work not in collaboration with other writers.|$|E
5|$|Farrar {{admitted}} that the marriage was never ideal. He later said that neither had expressed their love to each other, even at {{the early stages of}} marriage. Farrar recounted that Green seemed to lack the coping skills most adults bring to bear in challenging times; when she went into a rage, she sometimes harmed herself or broke things, and rarely gave any thought to whether she was in private or in public during these episodes. By the early 1990s, Farrar worked long hours away from the home to avoid arguments and what he perceived as his wife's shortcomings as a homemaker. When the couple fought, Green responded by treating the children, especially Tim, as small adults and telling them about what their father had <b>done</b> <b>wrong.</b> Swayed by their mother's opinions about their father, the children began to resent and disobey Farrar, to the point where Timothy and Farrar had physical altercations.|$|E
25|$|Native customs {{were worn}} {{down by the}} actions of the RCMP, who {{enforced}} Canadian criminal law on Inuit, such as Kikkik, who often could not understand what they had <b>done</b> <b>wrong,</b> and by missionaries who preached a moral code very different from the one they were used to. Many of the Inuit were systematically converted to Christianity in the 19th and 20th centuries, through rituals like the Siqqitiq.|$|E

25|$|Survivor guilt (or {{survivor}}'s guilt; {{also called}} survivor syndrome or survivor's syndrome) is a mental condition {{that occurs when}} a person perceives themselves to have <b>done</b> <b>wrong</b> by surviving a traumatic event when others did not.

They are deprived of all legal rights. Ghost detainees' identities, and capture, have been kept secret. As such they are a subset of extrajudicial prisoners, which includes all the detainees who were held in Guantanamo, etc..

25|$|Then the debaters {{return to}} their {{previous}} analysis of Pittacus' and Simonides' poetry. On Socrates' interpretation, Pittacus claims {{that it is difficult}} to be a good man, but presumably possible. Simonides, on the other hand, claims that it is impossible to live without ever being a bad man, and even to be a good man on occasion is difficult (344a45d). Simonides praises those who at least <b>do</b> not <b>do</b> <b>wrong</b> willingly. Socrates' interpretation is that, since Simonides was a wise man, he must know that no one <b>does</b> any <b>wrong</b> willingly; accordingly, he must mean that he will willingly praise those who <b>do</b> no <b>wrong,</b> not that some <b>do</b> <b>wrong</b> willingly and others unwillingly, only the latter garnering his praise (345d46b). Socrates thus argues that the authority of Simonides does not stand against his understanding of virtue and whether anyone willingly <b>does</b> <b>wrong.</b>|$|R

25|$|With Arthur's dodgy schemes, the duo {{encounter}} undesirable underworld figures, {{many of whom}} Arthur {{deals with}} and many of whom turn nasty, leaving Terry to fight and outwit {{their way out of}} trouble. But for all Arthur's obsession with get-rich-quick schemes, he is never malicious, usually simply being blinded by greed, and the pair often end up putting some other wrong right or helping others in need or who have been <b>done</b> <b>wrong</b> by, even if it proves to be Arthurs's Achilles' heel to his latest scheme fully succeeding. Most of Arthur's schemes fail in the end, owing to his greediness, but he does occasionally have the odd minor victory and puts one over on the law or more serious criminals.|$|E
25|$|The Escort quest is a {{combination}} of slaying monsters to maintain the well-being of a non-player character (NPC), while exploring an area alongside that NPC. A typical escort quest would involve protecting a character as he or she moves through a monster-infested area. A majority of the time, the quest will demand the player to slay multiple monsters {{to ensure the safety of}} the NPC. Escort quests can be beneficial, forcing the player's to focus on a particular area, in order to play out a scene or reveal a section of the plot. Escort quests can also be used to funnel a character from one location to another, leading the player along a route or path. However, problems with this type of quest can occur if the artificial intelligence controlling the NPC causes the NPC to behave in unexpected or unmanageable ways. Because many escort quests are often perceived as being <b>done</b> <b>wrong,</b> they are very unpopular amongst the gaming community.|$|E

A trailer was released on November 26, 2012, showing Underwood as a widow <b>done</b> <b>wrong,</b> bringing the lyrics of the song to life. It premiered on January 23, 2013, on Entertainment Tonight and Vevo. The video shows Underwood driving her black 1964 Cadillac through the countryside, heading towards her destination. Elsewhere, two women are shown attending a funeral devoid of any emotion complete with matching black veils. Intercut are scenes of Underwood's car in a dark alleyway and the cheating husband in its headlights. The video ends with the car running over the man and repairing itself afterwards.|$|E

500|$|Parts II and III have {{a similar}} structure; an {{overarching}} narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have [...] "a new and divine nature, which works against your evil natures, causing you to know when you have <b>done</b> <b>wrong,</b> and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin." [...] Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus {{to a greater extent}} on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the gibbet to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.|$|E
500|$|Hawks's {{first film}} The Road to Glory {{was based on}} a 35-page {{treatment}} that Hawks wrote and is one of only two Hawks works that are lost films. The film starred May McAvoy as a young woman who is gradually going blind and tries to spare the two men in her life from the burden of her illness. The two men are her boyfriend Rockliffe Fellowes and her father Ford Sterling, with Leslie Fenton playing the greedy rich man whom she agrees to live with in order to get away from her father and lover. The film contained religious iconography and messages that would never again be seen in a Hawks film. It was shot from December 1925 to January 1926 and premiered in April. It received good reviews from film critics. In later interviews, Hawks said, [...] "It didn't have any fun in it. It was pretty bad. I don't think anybody enjoyed it except a few critics." [...] Hawks was dissatisfied with the film after being certain that dramatic films would establish his reputation, but realized what he had <b>done</b> <b>wrong</b> when Sol Wurtzel told Hawks, [...] "Look, you've shown you can make a picture, but for God's sake, go out and make entertainment." ...|$|E
500|$|Back home, Kennedy {{played with}} the Port Colborne Sailors of the OHA Sr. league for the 1942‚Äì43 hockey season. The Port Colborne coach was former NHL star and Hall of Fame inductee Nels Stewart who had been hired in November. Stewart became a mentor to Kennedy, working on his playmaking skills. Kennedy credits Stewart with {{teaching}} him how to [...] "operate {{in front of the}} net". Kennedy finished the season second in the league, only one point behind scoring champion, Dillon Brady of Hamilton. It was during this time that Kennedy debuted as a player at Maple Leaf Gardens. OHA senior teams played at the Gardens on Friday evenings and this included Kennedy and the Port Colborne Sailors. At the end of the season, in early February 1943, in spite of his having abandoned the Royals, Montreal scout Gus Ogilvie was sent to induce Kennedy to sign a contract with the promise that if he signed, he would finish the season with the Canadiens in the NHL. Concerned about his treatment in Montreal, he declined, despite being warned by Ogilvie, [...] "Well, you know, Ted, if you turn pro, {{it will have to be}} with the Canadiens." [...] Kennedy now thought his dreams of playing in the NHL were over. However, Nels Stewart believed in Kennedy, considering him [...] "a coming great", and recommended him to the Toronto Maple Leafs. Shortly thereafter, Kennedy was called out of his grade 11 Latin class to the Principal's office. Kennedy, the high school student, was at first worried about what he may have <b>done</b> <b>wrong,</b> but it turned out to be a phone call from Nels Stewart. Stewart had arranged a meeting with General Manager of the Leafs Frank Selke and Kennedy had to travel immediately to Toronto. Unlike Montreal, the Maple Leafs had someone there to meet Kennedy when he got off the train. Kennedy signed a contract that evening.|$|E
