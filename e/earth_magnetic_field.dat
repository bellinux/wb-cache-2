50|$|The flux quantum plays a very {{important}} role in superconductivity. The <b>earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is very small (about 50 μT), but it generates one flux quantum in an area of 6 by 6 μm. So, the flux quantum is very small. Yet it was measured to an accuracy of 9 digits as shown in Eq.(21). Nowadays the value given by Eq.(21) is exact by definition.|$|E

5000|$|The {{component}} waves follow different paths, experience different attenuations, {{have different}} phase velocities, and, in general, are elliptically polarized in opposite senses.The critical {{frequency of the}} extraordinary wave is always greater than the critical frequency of the ordinary wave (i.e. the wave in absence of the magnetic field) by the amount approximately equal to [...]5 times of gyro frequency [...]The amplitude of extraordinary wave {{is dependent on the}} <b>earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> at that particular point [...] Beside splitting, the polarization of the incident radio wave is also effected by this phenomenon because the electron that were earlier in simple harmonic motion only are now in spiral motion too due to the magnetic field.|$|E
50|$|Young salmon {{spend one}} to four years in their natal river. When they are large enough (c. 15 cm), they smoltify, {{changing}} camouflage from stream-adapted with large, gray spots to sea-adapted with shiny sides. They also undergo some endocrinological changes to adapt to osmotic differences between fresh water and seawater habitat. When smoltification is complete, the parr (young fish) now begin to swim with the current instead of against it. With this behavioral change, the fish are now referred to as smolt. When the smolt reach the sea, they follow sea surface currents and feed on plankton or fry from other fish species such as herring. During their time at sea, they can sense {{the change in the}} <b>Earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> through iron in their lateral line.|$|E
50|$|Triad {{was used}} as an {{attitude}} determination technique to process the telemetry data from the Transit satellite system (used by the U.S. Navy for navigation). It {{is interesting to note that}} the principles of the Transit system gave rise to what we now know as the GPS satellite constellation. In an application problem, the reference vectors are usually known directions (e.g., stars, <b>Earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> gravity vector, etc.). Body fixed vectors are the measured directions as observed by an on-board sensor (e.g., star tracker, magnetometer, etc.). With advances in micro-electronics, attitude determination algorithms such as Triad have found their place in a variety of devices (e.g., smart phones, cars, tablets, UAVs etc.) with a broad impact on the modern society.|$|E
50|$|A broader {{disadvantage}} is {{the dependence}} on <b>Earth's</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> strength, making this approach unsuitable for deep space missions, and also {{more suitable for}} low Earth orbits as opposed to higher ones like the geosynchronous. The dependence on the highly variable intensity of <b>Earth's</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is also problematic because then the attitude control problem becomes highly nonlinear. It is also impossible to control attitude in all three axes even if the full three coils are used, because the torque can be generated only perpendicular to the <b>Earth's</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> vector.|$|R
500|$|In 1832, the German {{mathematician}} Carl Friedrich Gauss, {{assisted by}} Wilhelm Weber, implicitly defined the second {{as a base}} unit when he quoted the <b>earth's</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> in terms of millimetres, grams, and seconds. [...] Prior to this, {{the strength of the}} <b>earth's</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> had only been described in relative terms. The technique used by Gauss was to equate the torque induced on a suspended magnet of known mass by the <b>earth's</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> with the torque induced on an equivalent system under gravity. The resultant calculations enabled him to assign dimensions based on mass, length and time to the <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Magnetic field sensors, or [...] "magnetometers", can be {{categorized}} into four general types depending on {{the magnitude of the}} measured field. If the targeted B-field is larger than the <b>earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> (maximum value around 60 &micro;T), the sensor {{does not need to be}} very sensitive. To measure the earth field larger than the geomagnetic noise(around 0.1 nT), better sensors are required. For the application of magnetic anomaly detection, sensors at different locations have to be used to cancel the spatial-correlated noise in order to achieve a better spatial resolution. To measure the field below the geomagnetic noise, much more sensitive magnetic field sensors have to be employed. These sensors are mainly used in medical and biomedical applications, such as MRI and molecule tagging.|$|E
50|$|The {{configuration}} derives {{its name}} {{from the fact that the}} toroidal magnetic field in the outer region is reversed with respect to its direction on the axis. If the toroidal winding acts as a flux conserver, the field profile is generated by raising the plasma current to a convenient level. While the current is raised, the plasma generates an additional toroidal flux in the inner part of the column and the coil reacts in order to keep the total flux constant: in the outer region the toroidal field is thereby reduced and even reversed. The reversal can be enhanced and controlled by the external circuits. In a classical conductor the toroidal field in a steady state would reach, by diffusion, a uniform radial distribution. By contrast in an RFP the plasma relaxation processes maintain the configuration by a mechanism called dynamo effect (by analogy to theories of the <b>earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> generation).|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two methods}} of {{underwater}} geolocation that PSATs employ. The first method is through light based geolocation which uses {{the length of}} the day and a noon time calculation to estimate the tags location while underwater. This method has a functional depth limitation of light penetration which can be as shallow as a few meters to upwards of hundreds of meters. Geolocation estimates based on light are usually coupled with additional satellite data like sea surface temperature or other available data input such as bathymetry, land avoidance, and physical limitations of the tagged animal. The other method available is through measuring ambient light and the Earth's magnetic field. This method has a functional depth limitation equivalent of the maximum depth limitation, generally 1800m. Magnetic based geolocation is generally not coupled with additional satellite data or other inputs, and relies on the <b>Earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> for latitude estimations and light (noon time) for longitude estimations.|$|E

50|$|The use of {{magnetic}} fields in flow measurement {{date back to}} 19th century, when in 1832 Michael Faraday attempted to determine the velocity of the River Thames. Faraday applied a method in which a flow (the river flow) is exposed to a magnetic field (<b>earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field)</b> and the induced voltage is measured using two electrodes across the same flow. This method {{is the basis of}} the {{one of the most successful}} commercial applications in flow metering known as the inductive flowmeter. The theory of such devices has been developed and comprehensively summarized by Prof. J. A. Shercliff in early 1950s. While inductive flowmeters are widely used for flow measurement in fluids at room temperatures such as beverages, chemicals and waste water, they are not suited for flow measurement of media such as hot, aggressive or for local measurements where surrounding obstacles limit access to the channel or pipe. Since they require electrodes to be inserted into the fluid, their use is limited to applications at temperatures far below the melting points of practically relevant metals.|$|E
50|$|After visiting seven {{different}} authorities in Buenos Aires {{and with a}} personal letter from the President of the Argentine Civil Aviation Authority Melanie and Andreas succeeded to create the preconditions for a launch in Argentina. A mature 70-year-old scrap truck transported the autogyro {{to the airport and}} promptly got stuck in the mud just before reaching the hangar. In a complex operation the truck dinosaur could be freed with an additional four-wheel drive SUV and a tractor. The sport pilots took off and eventually flew along the Río Uruguay. Due to a singularity of the <b>earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> both compass and the GPS were disturbed and they temporarily lost orientation during the flight. They made it yet to the Iguazú Falls and filmed the largest waterfalls in the world, both from the air and from the ground. On their connecting flight, they were caught in a storm over the jungle, but reached the coast of the South Atlantic in Brazil. On the last leg of their Weltflug adventure, the couple flew over the beaches of Copacabana (Rio de Janeiro) and Ipanema. Five times they circled around the Christ the Redeemer (statue) statue of Rio de Janeiro, {{at the same time the}} climax and conclusion of the two-year adventure.|$|E
50|$|The GMI is {{essentially}} {{due to the}} penetration-length that {{is a measure of}} how deep an ac electrical current can flow inside an electrical conductor. The penetration-length, or skin-depth effect, increases with the square root of the electrical resistivity of the material and it is inversely proportional to the square root of the product of the magnetic permeability and the frequency of the ac electrical current. Thus, in materials with very high values of magnetic permeability, such as soft-ferromagnetic materials, the penetration-length can be much less than the thickness of the conductor even for moderate values of frequencies driving the ac electrical current to near the surface of the material. When an external magnetic field is applied, the size of the magnetic permeability diminishes increasing the penetration of the ac electrical current in the magnetic material. Large variations are observed in both in-phase and out-of-phase components of the magnetoimpedance in applied magnetic fields close to the value of the <b>Earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> up to few tens of Oersted. For comparison, in normal electrical conductors the effect of the skin-depth becomes important for frequencies in the microwave range only. Despite the dependence of the GMI with the geometry of the electrical conductor (ribbons, wires, multilayers meander-likes) and with the external parameters be somewhat complex, there are current theoretical models that allow one to calculate the GMI within some approximations. Beside the dependence of the GMI with the frequency of the ac electrical current there are other sources that contribute to the frequency dependence of the GMI such as the motion of the domain wall and the ferromagnetic resonance.|$|E

5000|$|BLITS (Ball Lens In The Space) is a Russian {{satellite}} {{launched on}} September 17, 2009, as a secondary payload on a Soyuz-2.1b/Fregat, from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan.The satellite is totally passive and spherical, and is tracked using {{satellite laser ranging}} by the International Laser Ranging Service. The purpose of the mission is experimental verification of the spherical glass retroreflector satellite concept as well as obtaining SLR data for solution of scientific problems in geophysics, geodynamics, and relativity [...] The design of BLITS {{is based on the}} optical Luneburg lens concept. The retroreflector is a multilayer glass sphere; it provides uniform reflection characteristics when viewed within a very wide range of angles, and can provide a cross-section sufficient for observations at low to medium orbit heights. A similar design was already tested on a smaller laser reflector carried on board of the METEOR-3M spacecraft launched on December 10, 2001.The satellite body consists of two outer hemispheres (radius 85.16 mm) made of a low-refraction-index glass and an inner ball lens (radius 53.52 mm) made of a high-refraction-index glass; the two outer hemispheres and the inner ball are glued together, and one of the outer hemispheres is externally coated with a reflective coating, covered with a protective varnish. The total mass is 7.53 kg.The satellite was inserted into an 832 km Sun-synchronous orbit, with an inclination of 98.85º. The satellite was spinning at a spin period of 5.6 seconds around the axis normal to its orbit plane, allowing laser light to be reflected in short bursts because only half of the satellite is covered in a reflective coating. Being the satellite made of glass, minimum in-flight slowdown of spin rate was expected, as there were no conducting parts where currents interacting with the <b>Earth</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> can be induced.The expected operative life was at least 5 years, but the mission was interrupted in 2013 after a collision with space debris.|$|E
