5|$|At the Rome Masters, Murray retired {{due to a}} hip injury {{during his}} second round match against Marcel Granollers on his 26th birthday. Murray had just battled back to tie the match at one set all after winning the second set on a tiebreak. This left Murray with only eleven days to be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> start of the French Open.|$|E
5|$|Baggio was {{not fully}} <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> final against Brazil at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, after pulling his {{hamstring}} during the semi-final {{and playing with}} the aid of a painkiller injection. Despite being far less dominant than in previous matches, he still tested Brazilian goalkeeper Cláudio Taffarel and was able to set up a few chances for his teammates. The match ended 0–0 after extra time; he took Italy's last penalty in the resulting shootout, but his kick went over the cross-bar and the Brazilians won the title in one of the most upsetting moments in World Cup history.|$|E
5|$|Ikumi's initial {{vision for}} Tokyo Mew Mew {{was a story}} called Tokyo Black Cat Girl that {{featured}} a cat-girl battling alien invaders. After the story was transitioned to a more upbeat story of five female superhumans, the character designs were redone to have a lighter, more colorful feel. The main series characters were praised for being a perfect <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> overall story, {{as well as for}} their cute appearances. The characters introduced in a la Mode were also praised for their visual appearances, but criticized as being repeats of the original series.|$|E

Soon afterwards he ended his season early in order to be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 2015 season. In Bolt's absence, Justin Gatlin had dominated the sprints, holding the year's fastest times, including seven of the top ten 100m runs that season.|$|E
5|$|Originating {{from central}} European lowlands, the Funnelbeaker people {{were able to}} utilize large expanses of less fertile soils, {{obtained}} by extensive reduction of forested areas, with the increased role of livestock. They moved south into the regions previously developed by the Danubian cultures, {{all the way to}} Bohemia and Moravia. Being more numerous, better <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> environment, organized and economically more productive, the Funnelbeaker culture people replaced the Danubian cultures in their late phase.|$|E
5|$|The best <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{shape of}} HAT-P-33b's orbit {{suggests}} that the orbit is slightly elliptical, as the planet's orbital eccentricity is fit to 0.148. However, because the star HAT-P-33 has such {{a high level of}} jitter, it is difficult to constrain the planet's eccentricity with accuracy. Most of the planet's defined characteristics are {{based on the assumption that}} HAT-P-33b has an elliptical orbit, although the planet's discoverers have also derived HAT-P-33b's characteristics on the assumption that the planet has a circular orbit. The elliptical model has been chosen because it is considered to be the most likely scenario.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the Navy uniforms were made in dark blue, but with the Southern style of rank {{insignia}} for the officers. The 1862 Confederate regulations ordered the uniform to be steel gray and lined with a dark black silk serge. They were also made in medium gray and cadet gray. They were made of wool, and these uniforms were not <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> heat of the lower decks of a ship. Non-commissioned officers wore a variety of uniforms, or even regular clothing.|$|E
5|$|Trescothick ended some {{speculation}} about his international career by {{announcing that he}} would like to be considered for a place in the national side in the future. England's management staff continued to support him, and named him in the initial 25-man squad for the 2007 Test series against the West Indies. Having recovered from a double hernia operation, and proving himself <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> start of the county season, Trescothick began his comeback to cricket by scoring 256 from 117 balls in a 50 over match against Devon on 8 April 2007, helping Somerset to 502–4 off their 50 overs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the age of}} 10, Kunis {{auditioned for}} but failed to get {{the role of a}} Russian Jewish girl who moves to America in the film Make a Wish, Molly. Instead, she was cast in the {{secondary}} role of a Mexican girl. In 1998, Kunis was cast as Jackie Burkhart in the Fox sitcom That '70s Show. All who auditioned were required to be at least 18 years old; Kunis, who was 14 at the time, told the casting directors she would be 18 but did not say when. Though they eventually figured it out, the producers still thought Kunis was the best <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role. That '70s Show ran for eight seasons. She won two consecutive Young Star Awards as Best Young Actress in a Comedy TV Series in 1999 and 2000 for her performances.|$|E

On 5 April 1840, the Wanderers boats seized the American slaver Eliza Davidson, which was {{subsequently}} condemned in British and Spanish Mixed Commission Court at Sierra Leone. On 12 May, Denman took the Josephina, a Portuguese schooner <b>fitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slave trade, as a prize. On 3 June, he took the schooner São Paolo de Loando as prize. On 9 June he took another schooner <b>fitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slave trade, the Maria Rosaria. On 3 July he took the Pombinha, out of Havanah, and <b>fitted</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> slave trade; on 29 December 1842, a prize court awarded Wanderers crew a tonnage bounty and moiety of proceeds for Pombinha.|$|R
5|$|Dominic Purcell as Lincoln Burrows: Lincoln is a {{high school}} {{drop-out}} and a convicted felon, who is wrongfully accused of and charged {{with the murder of}} Terence Steadman, the brother of the Vice President of the United States. Purcell was cast three days before the start of production and consequently, he was the last actor to join the original cast. He auditioned for the role while he had a recurring role as Tommy Ravetto on North Shore. Since working on John Doe, Purcell has had an amiable relationship with Fox. Hence, he was sent the pilot script of Prison Break. Scheuring's first impression of Purcell did not convince him as a <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> role since the actor went to the audition with his hair styled and a tan. However, Purcell's acting won the role. He arrived on the set {{on the first day of}} filming with a shaved head, which amazed Scheuring with the physical likeness of the series' two leading actors.|$|E
5|$|Overmars {{suffered}} a minor setback prior to Euro 2000 {{with a sore}} thigh muscle. However, he resumed training and was declared <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Netherlands opening match against Czech Republic, where he started on the bench. His introduction brought about the only goal of the match – a penalty scored the 89th minute. Ronald de Boer was adjudged to have had his shirt pulled whilst jumping to meet Overmars' cross. In the quarter-finals, he scored twice in the team's 6–1 win against Yugoslavia. The Netherlands went on to lose their semi-final to Italy on penalties. Overmars played in eight of the national team's ten 2002 World Cup qualifiers, {{but it was an}} unsuccessful campaign as they failed to qualify for the finals.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to build}} a Kohl's {{department}} store on the site occupied by Kona Lanes and the already-closed Edwards Cinema Center and Ice Capades Chalet were approved by the city's planning commissioners, but they were met with resistance by neighbors who {{did not believe the}} store was a good <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> area. Then-mayor Karen Robinson complained that Costa Mesa's policy-makers were discarding recreation as part of the quality of residents' lives, and appealed the commissioners' decision in February 2003. The city council later rejected the proposal. The continuing efforts to save Kona Lanes failed; it closed for good in May 2003 and was demolished soon after.|$|E

5|$|The initial squad was {{selected}} for the British team on 14 July; however, the final team was not confirmed until {{the outcome of a}} courtcase involving Dwain Chambers. Under the rules of the BOA, Chambers had been banned from future Games after testing positive for the steroid THG in 2003. His appeal to overturn that ban, {{on the grounds that it}} was an unfair restraint of trade, failed and he was omitted from the squad. The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly Sotherton, as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey, Paula Radcliffe, Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers. Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh. She eventually proved fit enough to start the race but struggled to finish in 23rd position.|$|E
5|$|As the 1934 season began, Allen was {{recovering}} from an operation to repair a rupture and played only once before that summer's Ashes series, in which Bob Wyatt captained England. Injury ruled {{him out of the}} second Test, but he was <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> third. In a drawn game, he scored 61 runs but took no wickets; troubled by uneven footholds, he bowled three wides and four no balls during his first over, which lasted for 13 deliveries. He was selected for the fourth Test but, unhappy with his fitness, withdrew to play for Middlesex. He was successful in several games preceding the final, deciding Test, and was included in the team. Australia won comfortably after scoring 701 in their first innings; Allen took four for 170 and was wicketless in the second innings. In two Tests, he took five wickets at an average in excess of 70 and scored 106 runs at 35.33. In all first-class games that season he scored 438 runs at 25.76 and took 51 wickets at 27.49. Amid growing speculation that Allen would be chosen as the next England captain, Warner arranged for him to captain a low-key tour to Gibraltar in early 1935. During the return journey, Allen pulled a muscle when his ship pitched unexpectedly; the injury limited his cricket during 1935. He played twice before withdrawing {{from the rest of the}} season on medical advice. Off the field, Allen was elected to the MCC Committee at the unusually young age of 32.|$|E
5|$|At {{the opening}} of the summer hard court swing Federer was {{defeated}} in the final of the Montreal Masters by Alexander Zverev after injuring his back during the match. Due to the injury, he opted to withdraw from the Cincinnati Masters to be <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> US Open. This injury effectively cost him the #1 ranking as he would have attained it by reaching the Cincinnati final, a tournament he has won seven times. Despite his withdrawal from Cincinnati, Federer had little time to recover for the US Open, and the back injury severely affected his practice sessions. Even from the start, he looked uncomfortable and it took him five sets to win each of the first two rounds against Frances Tiafoe and Mikhail Youzhny. His campaign at the US Open finally ended in the last 8, where he lost to Juan Martin del Potro in four sets. His game was hampered by unforced errors at crucial points in the match and even he admitted that he never felt {{he had a chance to}} win the tournament.|$|E

5|$|Bennett {{declined}} the offer to be Dole's running mate but suggested Kemp, a man described as Dole's antagonist. On August 16, 1996, the Republican Party chose Kemp as its vice presidential , running alongside former Senator Dole. Kemp {{was seen as}} a means to attract conservative and libertarian-minded voters like those of tough nomination-challengers Forbes and Pat Buchanan. Kemp was chosen over Connie Mack, John McCain, and Carroll Campbell, and it is assumed that this was partly because Kemp had several former staffers in influential positions as Dole's senior advisors. Dole had had a long history of representing the budget-balancing faction of the Party, while Kemp had had a long history of representing the tax-cutting advocates, and Kemp's tax-cutting fiscal track record was seen as the perfect <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ticket. When Kemp became Dole's running mate in 1996, they appeared {{on the cover of the}} August 19, 1996 issue of Time magazine, but the pair barely edged out a story on the reported discovery of extraterrestrial life on Mars, which was so close to being the cover story that Time inset it on the cover and wrote about how difficult the decision was.|$|E
5|$|Howarth {{continued}} to be {{kept out of the}} team in 2003–04, only making his first appearance after Achterberg was injured during the warm-up away to Swindon on 3 March 2004. Tranmere lost 2–0, although his performance was positive, making a number of good saves. However, Achterberg was declared <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> following match against Millwall on 7 March 2004, and Howarth returned to the substitutes' bench. He did not play another match for Tranmere that season. Howarth's first appearance of 2004–05 came as a 20th-minute substitute after Achterberg was injured away to Hull City on 18 December 2004. After conceding a goal scored by Ian Ashbee in the 34th minute, Howarth was injured in a challenge with Stuart Elliott, and was substituted at half-time. He was available for Tranmere's next match against Barnsley on 26 December 2004, and with Achterberg ruled out for the Christmas period with a knee injury, he started in a 1–1 home draw. This meant Howarth had a run of nine consecutive matches in goal for Tranmere, with an appearance against Oldham Athletic in the Football League Trophy Northern semi-final on 25 January 2005 being his last before Achterberg returned against Luton on 29 January. He failed to play again that season, and was released by Tranmere on 24 May 2005.|$|E
5|$|Other historians, {{including}} Richard Abels, P. Grosjean, and Alan Thacker, {{state that}} Deusdedit died on 14 July 664. The main argument was {{put forward by}} Grosjean, who claimed that Bede had the consecration date wrong, as 26 May was Maundy Thursday in 655, not a date that would normally have been chosen for a consecration. Grosjean argues that the best method for resolving the conflicts is to just take 14July 664 as the date of death, and figure backwards with the length of reign given by Bede, which gives a consecration date of 12March 655. Thacker and Abels agree generally, although Thacker does not give a specific consecration date beyond March. Abels adds to Grosjean's arguments Bede's association of Deusdedit's death with that of King Eorcenberht, which Bede gives as occurring on the same day. Bede states that the plague of 664 began soon after the eclipse on 1May. Nothing in Bede contradicts the date of 14July 664 for Eorcenberht; therefore, Abels considers that date {{to be the best}} <b>fit</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> available data. The historian D. P. Kirby agrees that Deusdedit died in 664, although he does not give a precise date within that year.|$|E
