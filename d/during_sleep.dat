5|$|In contrast, during wake periods {{differentiated}} effector cells, such as cytotoxic natural killer {{cells and}} CTLs (cytotoxic T lymphocytes), peak in order to elicit an effective response against any intruding pathogens. As well during awake active times, anti-inflammatory molecules, such as cortisol and catecholamines, peak. There are two theories {{as to why the}} pro-inflammatory state is reserved for sleep time. First, inflammation would cause serious cognitive and physical impairments if it were to occur during wake times. Second, inflammation may occur <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> times due to the presence of melatonin. Inflammation causes a great deal of oxidative stress and the presence of melatonin <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> times could actively counteract free radical production during this time.|$|E

40|$|Lucid dreams – {{dreams in}} which the dreamer is aware that is dreaming – most {{frequently}} occur <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep,</b> yet {{there is some evidence}} suggesting that lucid dreaming can occur <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep</b> as well. By conducting a sleep laboratory study on lucid dreams, we found two possible instances of lucidity <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep</b> which are reported here. While lucid dreaming <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep</b> seems to be much rarer and more difficult to achieve, it appears to be possible and is most likely to occur <b>during</b> N 1 <b>sleep,</b> somewhat less likely <b>during</b> N 2 <b>sleep</b> and yet to be observed <b>during</b> N 3 <b>sleep.</b> Future studies should explore induction methods, underlying neural mechanisms and perceptual/dream content differences between REM and NREM lucid dreams.

5|$|As a {{side effect}} of the {{electrochemical}} processes used by neurons for signaling, brain tissue generates electric fields when it is active. When large numbers of neurons show synchronized activity, the electric fields that they generate can be large enough to detect outside the skull, using electroencephalography (EEG) or magnetoencephalography (MEG). EEG recordings, along with recordings made from electrodes implanted inside the brains of animals such as rats, show that the brain of a living animal is constantly active, even <b>during</b> <b>sleep.</b> Each part of the brain shows a mixture of rhythmic and nonrhythmic activity, which may vary according to behavioral state. In mammals, the cerebral cortex tends to show large slow delta waves <b>during</b> <b>sleep,</b> faster alpha waves when the animal is awake but inattentive, and chaotic-looking irregular activity when the animal is actively engaged in a task. During an epileptic seizure, the brain's inhibitory control mechanisms fail to function and electrical activity rises to pathological levels, producing EEG traces that show large wave and spike patterns not seen in a healthy brain. Relating these population-level patterns to the computational functions of individual neurons is a major focus of current research in neurophysiology.|$|E
5|$|Occlusal trauma {{results from}} {{excessive}} biting forces exerted on teeth, which overloads the periodontal ligament, causing periodontal pain and a reversible increase in tooth mobility. Occlusal trauma may occur with bruxism, the parafunctional (abnormal) clenching and grinding of teeth <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> or while awake. Over time, {{there may be}} attrition (tooth wear), which may also cause dentin hypersensitivity, and possibly formation of a periodontal abscess, as the occlusal trauma causes adaptive changes in the alveolar bone.|$|E
30|$|Busek {{explains}} in [19] that the LF band power is increased <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep</b> and wakefulness whereas the HF band power is increased <b>during</b> deep <b>sleep.</b> This happens due to different grades of {{activity of the}} sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous system <b>during</b> the different <b>sleep</b> stages. The breathing rate is normally quite regular <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep.</b> Therefore, high HF peak power values are observed and the HF band power is concentrated in a narrow frequency range. In REM sleep, a high variability in the respiratory rate can be monitored. In consequence, the spectral power induced by respiration is spread over a wider frequency range. Taking this into account, we expect a low HF peak power and a high variability in the HF band <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep.</b>|$|R
40|$|Rapid eye {{movement}} (REM) sleep {{is considered to}} preferentially reprocess emotionally arousing memories. We tested this hypothesis by cueing emotional vs. neutral memories during REM and NREM sleep and wakefulness by presenting associated verbal memory cues after learning. Here we show that cueing <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep</b> significantly improved memory for emotional pictures, while no cueing benefit was observed <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep.</b> On the oscillatory level, successful memory cueing <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep</b> resulted in significant increases in theta and spindle oscillations with stronger responses for emotional than neutral memories. In contrast <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep,</b> solely cueing of neutral (but not emotional) memories was associated with increases in theta activity. Our results do not support a preferential role of REM sleep for emotional memories, but rather suggest that emotional arousal modulates memory replay and consolidation processes and their oscillatory correlates <b>during</b> NREM <b>sleep...</b>|$|R

5|$|Obesity hypoventilation {{syndrome}} (also {{known as}} Pickwickian syndrome) {{is a condition}} in which severely overweight people fail to breathe rapidly enough or deeply enough, resulting in low blood oxygen levels and high blood carbon dioxide (CO2) levels. Many people with this condition also frequently stop breathing altogether for short periods of time <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> (obstructive sleep apnea), resulting in many partial awakenings during the night, which leads to continual sleepiness during the day. The disease puts strain on the heart, which eventually may lead to the symptoms such as heart failure, leg swelling and various other related symptoms. The most effective treatment is weight loss, but it is often possible to relieve the symptoms by nocturnal ventilation with positive airway pressure (CPAP) or related methods.|$|E

There they collected the seeds of agricultural plants and took them to their village, thus ensuring a rich harvest. The dead pursued and shot arrows at them as they flew back home. The wounded burkudzäutä would fall sick after the return, and some of them would die. The mazzeri of neighbouring villages fought each other in spirit on the night between 31July and 1August. The village of the defeated mazzeri would suffer more deaths during the next year.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{review a}} {{recently}} developed approach for analyzing time series with long-range correlations by decomposing the signal increment series into magnitude and sign series and analyzing their scaling properties. We show that time series with identical long-range correlations can exhibit different time {{organization for the}} magnitude and sign. We apply our approach to series of time intervals between consecutive heartbeats. Using the detrended fluctuation analysis method {{we find that the}} magnitude series is long-range correlated, while the sign series is anticorrelated and that both magnitude and sign series may have clinical applications. Further, we study the heartbeat magnitude and sign series <b>during</b> different <b>sleep</b> stages — light sleep, deep sleep, and REM sleep. For the heartbeat sign time series we find short-range anticorrelations, which are strong <b>during</b> deep <b>sleep,</b> weaker <b>during</b> light <b>sleep</b> and even weaker <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep.</b> In contrast, for the heartbeat magnitude time series we find long-range positive correlations, which are strong <b>during</b> REM <b>sleep</b> and weaker <b>during</b> light <b>sleep.</b> Thus, the sign and the magnitude series provide information which is also useful for distinguishing between different sleep stages.

5|$|Most {{bacteria}} {{enter the}} lungs via small aspirations of organisms {{residing in the}} throat or nose. Half of normal people have these small aspirations <b>during</b> <b>sleep.</b> While the throat always contains bacteria, potentially infectious ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions. A minority of types of bacteria such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Legionella pneumophila reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets. Bacteria can spread also via the blood. Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the macrophages and neutrophils (defensive white blood cells) attempt to inactivate the bacteria. The neutrophils also release cytokines, causing a general activation of the immune system. This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia. The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.|$|E
5|$|Positive airway pressure, {{initially}} in {{the form}} of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP), is a useful treatment for obesity hypoventilation syndrome, particularly when obstructive sleep apnea co-exists. CPAP requires the use <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> of a machine that delivers a continuous positive pressure to the airways and preventing the collapse of soft tissues in the throat during breathing; it is administered through a mask on either the mouth and nose together or if that is not tolerated on the nose only (nasal CPAP). This relieves the features of obstructive sleep apnea and is often sufficient to remove the resultant accumulation of carbon dioxide. The pressure is increased until the obstructive symptoms (snoring and periods of apnea) have disappeared. CPAP alone is effective in more than 50% of people with OHS.|$|E
5|$|Sleep {{involves}} great {{changes in}} brain activity. Until the 1950s {{it was generally}} believed that the brain essentially shuts off <b>during</b> <b>sleep,</b> but this is now known to be far from true; activity continues, but patterns become very different. There {{are two types of}} sleep: REM sleep (with dreaming) and NREM (non-REM, usually without dreaming) sleep, which repeat in slightly varying patterns throughout a sleep episode. Three broad types of distinct brain activity patterns can be measured: REM, light NREM and deep NREM. During deep NREM sleep, also called slow wave sleep, activity in the cortex takes the form of large synchronized waves, whereas in the waking state it is noisy and desynchronized. Levels of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and serotonin drop during slow wave sleep, and fall almost to zero during REM sleep; levels of acetylcholine show the reverse pattern.|$|E

5|$|The {{hypothalamus}} in the diencephalon, {{is involved}} in regulating many functions of the body. Functions include neuroendocrine regulation, regulation of the circadian rhythm, control of the autonomic nervous system, and the regulation of fluid, and food intake. The circadian rhythm is controlled by two main cell groups in the hypothalamus. The anterior hypothalamus includes the suprachiasmatic nucleus and the ventrolateral preoptic nucleus which through gene expression cycles, generates a roughly 24 hour circadian clock. In the circadian day an ultradian rhythm takes control of the sleeping pattern. Sleep is an essential requirement for the body and brain and allows the closing down and resting of the body's systems. There are also findings that suggest that the daily build-up of toxins in the brain are removed <b>during</b> <b>sleep.</b> Whilst awake the brain consumes {{a fifth of the}} body’s total energy needs. Sleep necessarily reduces this use and gives time for the restoration of energy-giving ATP. The effects of sleep deprivation show the absolute need for sleep.|$|E

25|$|Before {{understanding}} Aristotle's {{views on}} dreams, first {{his idea of}} sleep must be examined. Aristotle gives an account of his explanation of sleep in On Sleep and Wakefulness. Sleep takes place {{as a result of}} overuse of the senses or of digestion, so it is vital to the body, including the senses, so it can be revitalized. While a person is asleep, the critical activities, which include thinking, sensing, recalling and remembering, do not function as they do during wakefulness. Since a person cannot sense <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> they can also not have a desire, which {{is the result of a}} sensation. However, the senses are able to work <b>during</b> <b>sleep,</b> albeit differently than when a person is awake because <b>during</b> <b>sleep</b> a person can still have sensory experiences. Also, not all of the senses are inactive <b>during</b> <b>sleep,</b> only the ones that are weary.|$|E
