60|$|I used {{to think}} at nite what you said, & for it i nocked off {{swearing}} months before my time was up, for i saw it want no good, nohow--the day my time was up you told {{me if i would}} shake the cross (QUIT STEALING) & live on the square for months, it would be the best job i ever done in my life. The state agent give me a ticket to here, & on the car i thought more of what you said to me, but didn't make up my mind. When we got to Chicago on the cars from there to here, I pulled off an old woman's leather; (ROBBED HER OF HER POCKETBOOK) i hadn't no more than got it off when i wished i hadn't done it, for awhile before that {{i made up my mind}} to be a square bloke, for months on your word, but forgot it when i saw the leather was a grip (EASY TO GET)--but i kept clos to her & when she got out of the cars at a way place i said, marm have you lost anything. & she tumbled (DISCOVERED) her leather was off (GONE)--is this it says i, giving it to her--well if you aint honest, says she, but i hadn't got cheak enough to stand that sort of talk, so i left her in a hurry. When i got here i had $1 and 25 cents left & i didn't get no work for 3 days as i aint strong enough for roust about on a steam bote (FOR A DECK HAND)--The afternoon of the 3rd day I spent my last 10 cts for moons (LARGE, ROUND SEA-BISCUIT) & cheese & i felt pretty rough & was thinking i would have to go on the dipe (PICKING POCKETS) again, when i thought of what you once said about a fellows calling on the Lord when he was in hard luck, & i thought i would try it once anyhow, but when i tryed it i got stuck on the start, & all i could get off wos, Lord give a poor fellow a chance to square it for 3 months for Christ's sake, amen; & i kept a thinking, of it over and over as i went along--about an hour after that i was in 4th St. & this is what happened & is the cause of my being where i am now & about which i will tell you before i get done writing. As i was walking along herd a big noise & saw a horse running away with a carriage with 2 children in it, & I grabed up a peace of box cover from the side walk & run in the middle of the street, & when the horse came up i smashed him over the head as hard as i could drive--the bord split to peces & the horse checked up a little & I grabbed the reigns & pulled his head down until he stopped--the gentleman what owned him came running up & soon as he saw the children were all rite, he shook hands with me and gave me a $50 green back, & my asking the Lord to help me come into my head, & i was so thunderstruck i couldn't drop the reigns nor say nothing--he saw something was up, & coming back to me said, my boy are you hurt? & the thought come into my head just then to ask him for work; & i asked him to take back the bill and give me a job--says he, <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>here</b> & lets talk about it, but keep the money--he asked me if i could take care of horses & i said yes, for i used to hang round livery stables & often would help clean & drive horses, he told me he wanted a man for that work, & would give me $16 a month & bord me. You bet i took that chance at once. that nite in my little room over the stable i sat a long time thinking over my past life & of what had just happened & i just got down on my nees & thanked the Lord for the job & to help me to square it, & to bless you for putting me up to it, & the next morning i done it again & got me some new togs (CLOTHES) & a bible for i made up my mind after what the Lord had done for me i would read the bible every nite and morning, & ask him to keep an eye on me. When I had been there about a week Mr. Brown (that's his name) came in my room one nite and saw me reading the bible--he asked me if i was a Christian & i told him no--he asked me how it was i read the bible instead of papers & books--Well Charlie i thought i had better give him a square deal in the start, so i told him all about my being in prison & about you, & how i had almost done give up looking for work & how the Lord got me the job when I asked him; & the only way i had to pay him back was to read the bible & square it, & i asked him to give me a chance for 3 months--he talked to me like a father for a long time, & told me i could stay & then i felt better than ever i had done in my life, for i had given Mr. Brown a fair start with me & now i didn't fear no one giving me a back cap (EXPOSING HIS PAST LIFE) & running me off the job--the next morning he called me into the library & gave me another square talk, & advised me to study some every day, & he would help me one or 2 hours every nite, & he gave me a Arithmetic, a spelling book, a Geography & a writing book, & he hers me every nite--he lets me come into the house to prayers every morning, & got me put in a bible class in the Sunday School which i likes very much for it helps me to understand my bible better.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{that deal}} with the problem of {{comparing}} two or more groups of handball players of different ages, are not so frequent. A number of Croatian authors contributed to these studies In a way that they have analyzed the differences between handball players at defferent levels of competition. In this study, a survey was conducted in order to determine whether there are differences between handball cadets and junior cadets in the motor and the specific motor skills. The sample in this study consisted of 30 handball players split in this way : the cadets (15), aged 16 - 17 years old and younger cadets (15) aged 13 - 14 years. There were 12 tests (of measuring instruments) for estimating general motor abilities and 4 tests for estimating specific-motor skills. Basic statistical parameters were calculated for all the results in the variables. Statistically significant difference between the arithmetic means of cadets and junior cadets was determined by t-test for small independent samples. The data obtained from the testing of differences between group of handball cadets and junior cadets showed that the handball cadets had significantly better results in the four variables (long <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> <b>here,</b> throwing a handball ball from the gray straddle the ground, throwing a medicine ball from lying on back and the accuracy of jump shot from 9 m), while the younger cadets achieved significantly better results in the two variables (side steps and slalom in the area between 6 - 9 m). Since the results showed that handball cadets had better results (in a number of variables) than younger cadets, this study was consistent with the previous studies attempted to analyze the differences between handball players of different ages...|$|E
40|$|The {{transposon}} Tc 1 of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is {{a member}} of the widespread family of Tc 1 /mariner transposons. The distribution pattern of virtually identical transposons among insect species that diverged 200 million years ago suggested horizontal transfer of the elements between species. This hypothesis gained experimental support when it was shown that Tc 1 and later also mariner transposons could be made to <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> vitro, with their transposase as the only protein required. Later it was shown that mariner transposons from one fruit fly species can <b>jump</b> <b>in</b> other fruit fly species and in a protozoan and, recently, that a Tc 1 -like transposon from the nematode <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> fish cells and that a fish Tc 1 -like transposon <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> human cells. <b>Here</b> we show that the Tc 1 element from the nematode <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> human cells. This provides further support for the horizontal spread hypothesis. Furthermore, it suggests that Tc 1 can be used as vehicle for DNA integration in human gene therapy...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{high-frequency}} propagation of shocks across international equity markets. We identify shocks to stock prices, liquidity (quoted and effective spreads), and trading activity (turnover and order imbalance) for 12 equity markets {{around the world}} based on non-parametric jump statistics at the 5 -minute frequency from 1996 to 2011. <b>Jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices, quoted spreads, and order imbalance are prevalent and large, while <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> effective spreads and turnover are rare. Within a market, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices are regularly accompanied by <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> order imbalance, but are independent of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> liquidity. <b>Jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices and co-jumps in prices and order imbalance are primarily driven by information rather than liquidity, {{since there is no}} subsequent price reversal and since they often occur around U. S. macroeconomic news announcements. We also present evidence that <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> prices and order imbalance (but not liquidity) spillover across markets within the same 5 -minute interval. Overall, we find that order imbalances help explain why shocks to stock prices occur and spread across markets, while shocks to liquidity tend to be isolated events...|$|R

40|$|There are two central {{issues in}} option pricing: {{selecting}} an appropriate model and quantifying the risk premiums {{of the various}} underlying factors.

The option data provides strong evidence supporting the presence of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility. In conjunction with previous results, this implies that stochastic volatility, <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> returns and <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility are all important components. Next, we find strong cross-sectional evidence <b>in</b> support of <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> returns, and modest evidence for <b>jumps</b> <b>in</b> volatility.

40|$|Most of the {{modelling}} of body {{dynamics in}} sports and other activities assumes that every anatomical segment is solid and moves ‘as a whole’. In the past a technique has been provided to estimate the relative motion of the visceral mass {{with respect to the}} trunk segment, a movement potentially affecting respiration and <b>jump</b> performance <b>in</b> general. <b>Here</b> we refine and expand that methodology by testing its ability to detect a smaller viscera excursion, within the trunk, expected <b>in</b> a respiratory-assisted <b>jumping</b> strategy, which stiffen the abdominal content and is expected to lower the degrees of freedom of the bouncing body. Six subjects where analysed, by using both inverse and direct dynamics, while repeatedly jumping vertically before and after a specific respiratory training period. The viscera excursion showed a consistent intra-individual time course, and decreased by about 30 ± 9 % when the subjects had been familiarized with the trunk stiffening manoeuvre. We conclude that: 1) the present methodology proved capable to detect subtle visceral mass movement within the trunk during repetitive motor acts and, particularly 2) the new respiratory technique increased stiffness of the trunk and reduced visceral displacement...|$|R
