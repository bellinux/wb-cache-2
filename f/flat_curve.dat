60|$|Yet, I {{suppose there}} must be {{something}} in the superstition that one part of London is more bracing or more relaxing than another, and that there is really, however insensibly, a difference of levels. That difference of temperaments which I have mentioned, seems mostly intimated in the size and age of the houses. They are larger and older in Bloomsbury, where they express a citizen substance and comfort; they are statelier about the parks and squares of Belgravia, which is comparatively a new settlement; but there are more little houses among the grandeurs of Mayfair which is of the same social quality, though many of its streets crossing from Piccadilly have quite gone to shops and family hotels and lodgings. It is more irregular and ancient than Belgravia, and its grandeurs have a more casual air. The historic mansions crowded by the clubs towards Hyde Park Corner, and grouped about the open space into which Piccadilly falters there, or following the park in the <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> of Park Lane, have not the effect of withdrawal and exclusion of the Belgravian mansions; beyond which again there is a world of small dwellings of fainter and fainter self-assertion till they fade into the hopeless plebeian unconsciousness of Pimlico, whose endless streets are without beauty or dignity. Yet beyond this lost realm Chelsea redeems itself in a grace of domestic architecture and an atmosphere of esthetic associations which make it a favorite abode of the tastes as well as the means. Kensington, where you arrive after what seems hopeless straggling through the roaring thoroughfare prolonging the Fleet-and-Strand-derived Piccadilly, is of almost equal artistic and literary appeal, but is older and perhaps less actual in its claims upon the cultivated sympathies. In either of these regions the polite American of definite resources might, if banished from the republic, dwell in great material and spiritual comfort; but if he chose Chelsea for his exile, I do not know that I should blame his preference. There he would have the neighborhood of many charming people whom to know for neighbors would add a certain grace to existence, although he might not otherwise know them. Besides he would have, beyond the Thames, the wooded stretch of Battersea Park, if his dwelling, as it very well might, looked out upon the river and across it; and in the distance he would have the roofs and chimneys of that far Southwark, which no one seems anxious to have nearer than, say, the seventeenth century, and yet which being a part of London must be full of perfectly delightful people.|$|E

5000|$|In the Bode plot of a {{transimpedance}} amplifier with no compensation, the <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> with the peak, labeled I-to-V gain, is the frequency {{response of the}} {{transimpedance amplifier}}. The peaking of the gain curve is typical of uncompensated or poorly compensated transimpedance amplifiers. The curve labeled AOL is the open-loop response of the amplifier. The feedback factor, plotted as a reciprocal, is labeled 1/β. In Fig. 5 the 1/β curve and AOL form an equilateral triangle with the frequency axis. The two sides have equal but opposite slopes, since one {{is the result of}} a first-order pole, and the other of a first-order zero. Each slope has a magnitude of 20 dB/decade, corresponding to a phase shift of 90°. When the amplifier's 180° of phase inversion is added to this, the result is a full 360° at the fi intercept, indicated by the dashed vertical line. At that intercept, 1/β = AOL for a loop gain of AOLβ = 1. Oscillation will occur at the frequency fi because of the 360° phase shift, or positive feedback, and the unity gain. [...] To mitigate these effects, designers of transimpedance amplifiers add a small-value compensating capacitor (Cf in the figure above) in parallel with the feedback resistor. When this feedback capacitor is considered, the compensated feedback factor becomes ...|$|E
5000|$|The International Energy Agency (IEA) saw overall stagnating annual {{installations}} {{in the range}} of 36-39 GW until 2020, when global capacity would reach 403 GW, according to the highlighted baseline case scenario of the Medium Term Renewable Energy Market 2014 report. Paradoxically, since the report's 2013-edition, projected cumulative for 2018 had increased by 6% from 308 GW to 326 GW, while the corresponding annual deployment decreased. This was {{due to the fact that}} the International Energy Agency adjusted annual installations upward on the near-end - in order to meet actual deployment, while reducing estimates on the far-end. The result was a <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> that stayed below 40 GW until 2020 (see table). For 2017, the projected low of 36 GW concided with the scheduled expiration of the solar investment tax credit (ITC) in the U.S. and the expected end of the solar boom in Japan. IEA's projected annual installation of less than 40 GW also lead to a negative growth rate, since expectations for 2015 were much higher. Such a decline, however, would have been unprecedented and has never been observed in the recorded history of solar PV deployment. This scenario made IEA's baseline case the most conservative of all projections. In the less featured enhanced high case scenario, IEA estimated that [...] "solar PV could reach a cumulative 465 GW to 515 GW in 2020" [...] and that [...] "solar PV capacity could top 500 GW globally in 2020".|$|E

40|$|Given that {{a greater}} injury {{incidence}} {{has been shown}} for indoor versus outdoor running tracks, attention to mechanical differences in curve running is warranted. Hence, the main objective {{of this study was}} to compare knee and ankle kinematics of runners while running on an indoor track with a <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> and a banked-curve in young elite runners. Six elite runners participated in the study. Knee and ankle kinematics were measured while the subjects ran on a <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> and a 19 % banked-curve. No significant differences were observed in left and right knee and ankle peak angular displacements between the two different curves. Angular displacements measured have demonstrated similar profiles to those presented in previous studies. However, significant differences were found in body lean angle between speeds but not between curve inclinations. In conclusion, the results suggest that curve inclination does not perturb lower limb kinematics for elite runners...|$|E
40|$|Reasons for {{performing}} study: Locomotion adaptation mechanisms {{have been observed}} in horses, but little information is available in relation to banked and nonbanked curve locomotion, which might be important to optimise training environments. Objectives: To determine if adaptation mechanisms in horses existed when moving on a banked compared to a <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> and whether adaptation was similar in different gaits. Methods: Eight infrared cameras were positioned {{on the outside of}} a 10 m lungeing circle and calibrated. Retroreflective markers were used to define left and right metacarpus (McIII) and proximal phalanges (P 1), metatarsus (MtIII), head and sacrum. Data were recorded at 308 Hz from 6 horses lunged at walk, trot and canter on a flat and 10 ° banked circle in a crossover design. Measurements extracted were speed, stride length, McIII inclination, MtIII inclination, relative body inclination and duty factor. Data were smoothed with a fourth order Butterworth filter with 30 Hz cut-off. ANOVA was used to determine differences between conditions and limbs. Results: Adaptation mechanisms were influenced by gait. At canter inside forelimb duty factor was significantly longer (P< 0. 05) on a <b>flat</b> <b>curve</b> compared to a banked curve; at walk this was reversed. McIII inclination, MtIII inclination and relative body inclination were significantly greater (P< 0. 05) at trot and canter on a <b>flat</b> <b>curve,</b> so more inward tilt was found relative to the bearing surface. Conclusion: Adaptation to curved motion is gait specific. At faster gaits it appears that horses negotiate a banked curv...|$|E
