Because electroosmotic velocities are independent of conduit size, {{as long as the}} electrical double layer is much smaller than the characteristic length scale of the channel, electroosmotic flow will have little effect. Electroosmotic flow is most significant when in small channels. Electroosmotic flow is an essential component in chemical separation techniques, notably capillary electrophoresis.

Low EEO agarose is therefore generally preferred for use in agarose gel electrophoresis of nucleic acids, but high EEO agarose may be used for other purposes. The lower sulphate content of low EEO agarose, particularly low-melting point (LMP) agarose, is also beneficial in cases where the DNA extracted from gel is to be used for further manipulation as the presence of contaminating sulphates may affect some subsequent procedures, such as ligation and PCR.

Isoelectric focusing, <b>electroendosmosis</b> and thiobarbituric acid gave similar results. Affinity chromatography gave lower results than isoelectric focusing for normal values but similar results for diabetics. Ion-exchange chromatography gave 24 % lower results than isoelectric focusing across the range.

40|$|The {{two-directional}} rocket method, a newly modified {{method for}} quantitative immunoelectrophoresis, {{was used as}} the assay for separating SC and SIgA, which have identical antigenicity but differ in mobility. This method proved to be sufficiently simple and sensitive to enable simultaneous assay of SC and SIgA in saliva. The method employs electrophoresis into antibody-containing agarose/agar gel in the presence of heparin-Ca EDTA. The height of the precipitation peaks formed in two directions is proportional to the concentration of the antigens. Concomitant use of agarose which has little <b>electroendosmosis</b> and agar which has high <b>electroendosmosis</b> facilitated cathodic migration of SIgA. Transfer of SC from beta-region to alpha 1 -region without influencing the mobilities of SIgA, albumin or IgG was obtained by addition of heparin-Ca EDTA to agarose/agar gel. This effect of heparin-Ca EDTA is vulnerable to changes of pH of the gel, but is almost completely independent of change in composition or concentration of the gel. The function of heparin as a polyanion may be resonsible for it. Carbamylation of antibody was used to accelerate a clear-cut resolution of the cathodic rockets. This technique was found to be a method of choice for analysis of SIgA and SC in large numbers. In using this method as a screening assay for detection of primary immunodeficiency, by studying saliva samples collected from 3 month old infants on the occasion of regular check-up over a 2 year period, two cases of isolated IgA immunodeficiency and two cases of hypoglobulinaemia were discovered in 12, 000 infants...|$|E
40|$|The {{method of}} {{displacement}} electrophoresis is described and its analogy with displacement chromatog. shown. The app. consists basically of a capillary tube, a few tenths of a mm bore and thin walled, uniting 2 vessels, each contg. an electrode. For the anal. of anions the cathode vessel contains an anion less mobile than {{any in the}} sample mixt. to be analyzed. The capillary tube is filled with a soln. of a salt of an anion more mobile than any in the sample and a buffering cation. The anode vessel contains the buffering cation. The electrodes must not produce interfering ions or gas. To reduce disturbance by <b>electroendosmosis</b> a long chain soluble polymer is used to increase the viscosity of the soln. in the capillary tube, and the electrode vessel is closed at the end to which <b>electroendosmosis</b> would cause flow if it were open. The sample is introduced between the cathode and the capillary, and a const. current is passed between the electrodes. The anions in the sample move initially at different speeds until they are sepd. in order of their mobility. Then all the anions in the app. move down the capillary at the same speed, assuming the tube to be of const. bore. The boundary between each successive pair of ions {{is more or less}} sharp, depending upon the diffusion consts., the potential gradient, the difference in mobility, and the disturbance caused by <b>electroendosmosis,</b> temp. difference across the capillary, and flow of liq. Each zone has a characteristic pH. Once the train of anions has sepd. it proceeds down the capillary unchanged. Since each zone has a particular potential gradient, it has also a particular rate of heat generation per unit length and a particular temp. It is thus possible to follow the sepn. by means of fixed thermocouples {{on the outside of the}} tube, which will record the fronts as they pass under the thermocouple. A thermocouple measuring the temp. of the capillary relative to its surrounding plots a series of steps on a recorder, the height of a step from the baseline being a measure of the mobility. The length of the step is preferably measured from the distance between the peaks of the record provided by a differential thermocouple measuring the difference in temp. along a short length of the tube, which gives a record which is the differential of the step curve. The length of step is proportional to the length of tube occupied by that species of ion and hence to the quantity. A qual. and quant. anal. is possible. [on SciFinder (R) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{conditions}} which control {{the transmission of}} fluids across the human epithelium are important {{in connection with the}} local introduction of soluble substances. In 1924 Rein (1) investigating human skin by <b>electroendosmosis</b> concluded that the rate of flow toward the cathode was greater in distilled water than in any neutral salt solution. The inhibition increased with increased concentration and the specific effect of the cations was according to the series A 1 > Ca> Na> K. For some time it has been known that under a given potential difference a simple relationship may exist between the velocity of a particle relative to the liquid in which it is suspended and the volume of flow of the liquid streaming through a membrane having the same chemical constitutioh as the surface of the particle. Both the velocity of migration and the volume of flow are proportional to the electrokinetic potential existing across the effective double layer. This is particularly true for protein surfaces (2 - 3) and one would expect the results obtained by electrophoresis to be comparable to those reported by <b>electroendosmosis.</b> EXPEI ~ TME. NTAL The stratum corneum of the human skin was washed with water, extracted with acetone, alcohol, and ether; dried in a vacuum at body temperature and powdered in a ball mill.

40|$|International audienceAgar {{is a major}} {{gelling agent}} used both in food and {{pharmaceutical}} applications. Traditional purification of agar is generally performed by sequential time consuming chemical and/or physical steps, leading to both poor recovery yields and low productivities. As a consequence, only 30 % {{of the amount of}} agar produced is actually available under purified form to feed the world market. The current limiting factor for purification is the presence of sulphated compounds such as sulphated-agaropectin, which strongly affect the technological properties of the agar gel such as gel strength, melting and fusion temperatures and <b>electroendosmosis.</b> In this context, this communication aims at discussing about the development of a biorefining agar purification approach which allows overcoming the current limitations associated with traditional purification methods.

40|$|The {{production}} of concentration P. D. 's across {{the skin of}} the frog is very intimately related to the pH of the applied solutions. On the alkaline side of an isoelectric point the dilute solution is electropositive; on the acid side this solution becomes electronegative. When the pH is suddenly lowered from a value more alkaline than this isoelectric point to one considerably more acid the change in polarity may occur within a few seconds. The effect is reversible. When a series of unbuffered solutions at different pH values are applied reversal curves may be obtained. When the concentration gradient is. 1 N-. 001 N KCl the reversal points lie between pH 4. 1 and 4. 8. When studied in acetate buffers this electromotive reversal is found to be closely correlated with the electrical charge upon the membrane, as determined by <b>electroendosmosis</b> through it. Reversal occurs between pH 4. 9 and 5. 2. It is concluded that the electromotive behavior of this material is controlled by some ampholyte, or group of ampholytes, within the membrane. This ampholyte is probably a protein. On both sides of their isoelectric point these membranes, in common with protein membranes, behave as if they retarded or prevented the movement through them of ions of the same electrical sign as they themselves bear, while permitting the movement of ions of the opposite sign. It is suggested that this correlation arises because of electrostatic effects between the charged surfaces and ions in the solution...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of an extensive set of laboratory experiments performed to design a demonstrative electrokinetic plant for extracting heavy metals from marine sediments dredged from the Livorno marine harbour. The investigated sediments displayed a high salinity, a high acid neutralization capacity, a low electrical resistivity (0. 5 Ωm), a high alkalinity (pH ≈ 8) and a large fraction of fine particles. The target metals were Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn at relatively weak and inhomogeneous concentrations with high non-mobile fractions. After an accurate characterization, several screening and full electrokinetic tests were performed using cells of two different sizes, several conditioning agents (HNO 3, HCl, H 2 SO 4, citric acid, oxalic acid, ascorbic acid, EDTA), different applied current intensities and durations. The tests highlighted the need for long treatment times in order to obtain a significant pH reduction, with some appreciable metal removal being attained only after several weeks. The best results were obtained with strong acids used as the conditioning agents, with significant specific effects of each acid, including pronounced resistivity increase (from 0. 5 up to 10 Ωm) and a high electroosmotic flow (EOF) with H 2 SO 4, or a reversed EOF (<b>electroendosmosis),</b> and minor resistivity changes with HNO 3. The use of the obtained data to design a demonstrative plant is also presented in the paper, with considerations on operating parameters such as energy and reagent consumption, characteristics of plant components and required safety measures. buffer capacity, conditioning agent...|$|E
40|$|The current use of {{antibiotics}} is very excessive in multiple settings, from treating patients to being present in cleaning products. This overuse {{of antibiotics}} is resulting in multiple consequences, ranging from having {{a negative impact on}} human health to breeding antibiotic-resistant strains of microorganisms. Antimicrobial surfaces are useful today to aid in sterilization, especially in the medical setting. This would help prevent the spread of infection of microorganisms in these settings. In our research, agarose acts as the antimicrobial surface and essential oils would act as the solution incorporated into the surface that has the antimicrobial properties. Agarose is a polysaccharide that derives from red algae. It forms long chains and has charged groups linked to it, like sulfate. These residues are responsible for many of agarose’s properties, such as <b>electroendosmosis,</b> which allows it to undergo gel electrophoresis. Thirty-three essential oils tested against bacteria to see if they had any antimicrobial properties. Many of them have historical uses that include as a medicine to treat infections. To create the agarose plates, agarose powder and the solvent heat up to dissolve. The solution went into the plates and multiple essential oils underwent testing for antimicrobial properties by the dispersion of the oils in the plates. Bacteria inoculated the plates and they grew. The results show that of the thirty-three oils tested, oregano, clove, ginger, lemongrass, and frankincense have antimicrobial properties. Of these oils, oregano, clove, and lemongrass have similar results to others in the same field. Ginger and frankincense oils did not have as much research conducted on their antimicrobial properties to determine, so these experiments helped bring new information about these oils to light.

40|$|It {{is shown}} {{that when a}} {{mammalian}} serous membrane bathed in dilute buffer is traversed by an electric current, liquid is caused to stream through the membrane toward the cathode when the pH value of the buffer is on the alkaline side of a certain critical hydrogen ion concentration. Streaming is toward the anode on the acid side of the reversal point. Simple means for studying this <b>electroendosmosis</b> quantitatively are described. The mean values of the reversal points in all cases studied with the present buffers lie between pH = 4. 3 and 5. 3. The membranes studied have been the mesentery of the living and dead animal, and the parietal pericardium and pleura, post mortem. The membranes of dogs, cats, rabbits, and two human pericardia have been studied. All these membranes are essentially sheets of connective tissue, bearing blood vessels, lymphatics, and nerves, {{and in some instances}} fat cells, and lined on each surface by a single layer of pavement mesothelial cells. Intercellular fibers form the major bulk of the lean membranes. These are predominantly collagenous except in the pleural region used, in which elastin fibers are present in large proportion. By using buffers alternately more acid or more alkaline than the reversal point, the direction of liquid flow across any given membrane site could be reversed an indefinite number of times. The time interval required is only that taken by the requisite manipulation in changing buffers and making the runs. The mean values of the reversal points for the several membranes when bathed in hypotonic, unbalanced buffer and in isotonic, physiologically balanced buffers showed only small and inconstant differences. The fat and lean pericardia similarly showed small difference in the positions of the mean reversal points. The apparent reversal points for the mesenteries of living animals proved to be lower than those for the mesenteries post mortem. This low value in the animals with functioning circulation is interpreted as essentially due to admixture with the buffers of buffer salts from the blood. Clear differences between the reversal points of the membranes in the first compared with later hours or days post mortem were not detected, {{with the possible exception of}} a small shift toward the acid range of the fat pericardium reversal points estimated several days post mortem. The reversal points with cat membranes were somewhat lower (more acid) than those of the dog. The approximate mean reversal points found with the citrate-phosphate buffers used were as follows: For mesenteries of living animals pH = 4. 4; for mesenteries, post mortem, pH = 4. 8; for cat pleuræ, post mortem, pH = 4. 3; for dog pleuræ, post mortem, pH = 5. 0; for lean and fat pericardia, post mortem, pH = 5. 1. The mean reversal point of the two human pericardia was about pH = 5. 0. Reversal points determined with buffers containing only monovalent anions are somewhat higher (less acid), as will be shown later. The bearing of these data on the question of the chemical composition of the surfaces of the fat cells of the serous membranes is discussed. Briefly, it is believed that proteins are probably present in important amount in these cell surfaces...|$|E
