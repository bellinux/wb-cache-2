2500|$|I {{thought is}} disgraceful that the Australian Rugby Union would not send its best team. But the blame cannot be laid {{at their feet}} alone. The egotist coaches at Super 12 level {{did not want to}} {{jeopardise}} their Super 12 prospects by releasing any of their star players. So we took a team minus the top players in Australia. The ARU had the view that Australia should target winning a Super 12 title, via the Brumbies, Waratahs or Reds, rather than pooling the best of their resources for a tilt at the World Cup Sevens Crown. <b>Just</b> <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> the professional age.|$|E

I said that over the water we were not quite so generous; that with us, when a singer had lost his voice and a jumper had lost his legs, these parties ceased to draw. I said I {{had been to the}} opera in Hanover, once, and in Mannheim once, and in Munich (through my authorized agent) once, and this large experience had nearly persuaded me that the Germans PREFERRED singers who couldn't sing. This was not such a very extravagant speech, either, for that burly Mannheim tenor's praises had been the talk of all Heidelberg for a week before his performance took place--yet his voice was like the distressing noise which a nail makes when you screech it across a window-pane. I said so to Heidelberg friends the next day, and they said, in the calmest and simplest way, that that was very true, but that in earlier times his voice HAD been wonderfully fine. And the tenor in Hanover was <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>example</b> <b>of</b> this sort. The English-speaking German gentleman who went with me to the opera there was brimming with enthusiasm over that tenor. He said: ...|$|E

Jourian, one of the four students cast for the show: [...] "What pushed me to do it was the idea of showing trans people of color, pushing beyond the American image of a gay white man."

40|$|Software localisation, {{the process}} of {{translating}} and adapting a software product into another language, is by definition an extreme <b>example</b> <b>of</b> target-oriented translation. This strong target-orientation derives from the very particular nature of the textual components contained in a software product. Typically, these are text strings embedded in the software interface and on-line and printed documentation. These components not only transmit operational information but also help in giving the product its commercial appeal. The translation process is thus subject to a double constraint: on the one hand, it must provide a text which is {{as effective as the}} original in transmitting information; on the other, it must ensure that the translated product has the same commercial appeal as the original. A cursory survey of the strategies and techniques adopted by localizers in the translation of software applications from English into Italian reveals that the source-language text is often substantially adapted, if not reworked, to meet the stylistic and cultural requirements of Italian users/consumers. Nonetheless, far from being a special case of language transfer, software localisation can be considered as <b>just</b> <b>another</b> <b>example,</b> however extreme, <b>of</b> the cultural and extra-linguistic constraints placed on any act of translation...|$|R
