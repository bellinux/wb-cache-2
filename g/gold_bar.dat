25|$|There {{are three}} classes of soldier {{common to all}} races: swordsmen, bowmen and squad leaders. The level of swordsmen and bowmen is set by the player prior to recruitment, with both types of soldier having three ranks, {{determined}} {{by the amount of}} gold necessary for recruitment (no gold for Level 1, one <b>gold</b> <b>bar</b> for Level 2 and two gold bars for Level 3). Squad leaders are available in only one rank, and require a sword, a suit of armour and three gold bars to recruit. As well as being stronger and having more health than a Level 3 swordsman, they also affect the troops around them; improving their formations, increasing their combat strategy, and enhancing their abilities. Each race can also produce warships, war machines (catapults for the Romans, magical lightening generators for the Vikings, canons for the Mayans, and ballistae for the Trojans), and special military units (medics for the Romans, axe warriors for the Vikings, blowgun warriors for the Mayans, and backpack catapultists for the Trojans).
