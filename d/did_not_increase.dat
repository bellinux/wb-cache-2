Constantine II decided to separate it from pagan Gaza in 331, giving Maiuma its own episcopal see. Julian reversed the process during his reign {{in the latter half of}} the 4th century. Although Maiuma had its own bishop, clergy, and diocesan territory, it shared its magistrates and administration with Gaza. Upon Julian's death, Maiuma's independence was restored and the rivalry between it and Gaza intensified.|$|E
