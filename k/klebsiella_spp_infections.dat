Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed and results interpreted using reference broth microdilution methods. in the 4 year period, a total of 1961 urine isolates from hospitalized patients were included. the patients' mean age was 51. 3 years and most of the infections occurred among women (65. 6 %). Esherichia coli as the most frequent pathogen isolated followed by Klebsiella Spp., Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Proteus mirabilis. Among the E. coli isolates. piperacillin/tazobactam. aztreonam. extended-spectrum cephalosporins, carbapenems and amikacin constitute reasonable therapeutic Option, for treatment of serious UTI in Latin America (91. 0 - 100. 0 % Susceptible). High resistance rates to fluoroquinolones (17. 5 - 18. 9 %) and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (> 45. 0 %) ere observed among the E. coli. in contrast. nitrofurantoin displayed susceptibility rate of > 87. 0 %. Against <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> <b>infections,</b> the only effective therapeutic option would be the carbapenems due to the high number of isolates (> 30. 0 %) producing extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL). Even the new fluoroquinolones showed limited activity against Klebsiella spp, (72. 1 - 88. 6 % susceptible) and the P. aeruginosa isolates showed high resistance rates to most antimicrobial agents tested. the results of this survey endorse the importance of Enterobacteriaceae as cause of UTI in Latin America. Our results also demonstrate that the uropathogens isolated in the Latin American medical centers exhibit high resistance to various classes of antimicrobial agents. Carbapenem-resistant P. aeruginosa, ciprofloxacin-resistant E. coli, ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae constitute serious problem in this geographic region. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Inc.

40|$|Background/Aim. Infection {{following}} {{total hip arthroplasty}} (THA) or total knee arthoplasty (TKA) {{may have}} devastating consequences. Some bacterial strains are often encountered as agents of these infections, others occur less frequently but are sometimes burdened with more severe complications. <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> are uncommon causes of THA or TKA infection. The {{aim of this study}} was to identify an effective treatment algorithm for multidrug resistant <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> caused THA or TKA infections. Methods. During the 3 -year period, from January 1 2009 to December 31 2011, we registered and treated 5 patients with THA or TKA multidrug resistant <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> caused <b>infection.</b> All the patients were primarily operated in other institutions, and were admitted in our clinic after the onset of infection symptoms. In three of the cases Klebsiella infection was complicated by additional infection (Staphyloccocus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Serratia marscescens). In 3 of the cases we performed revision arthroplasty after double exchange of antibiotic-loaded articulating cement spacer, and in 2 of the cases the standard two stage revision approach with one antibiotic cement spacer exchange was applied. Results. The mean length of follow-up after reimplantation surgery was 17. 1 months (range 2 - 31 months). One patient died 2 months after the final reimplantation procedure. The initial Klebsiella infection was eradicated in all patients. At the end follow-up after definitive reimplantation, patients had no clinical, laboratory or microbiological parameters positive for active infection. Conclusion. According to our experience with multidrug-resistant Klebsiella TKA/THA infections, two-stage approach, in some cases with double articulating cement spacer exchange prior to definitive reimplantation, is the most effective treatment option...|$|R
40|$|SYNOPSIS Four {{patterns}} of inositol fermentation by different isolates of Klebsiellae are described. Inositol fermentation by some isolates may be modified by medium incorporation of acetoin and diacetyl. An inositol-hydrogen sulphide-motility medium, modified {{by reducing the}} pH value, increasing the inositol concentration, and the incorporation of acetoin, is described and evaluated {{as a means of}} detecting acid production by isolates showing different inositol fermentation patterns. The implications of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp</b> in nosocomial <b>infections</b> are widely appreciated. However, their differentiation from other genera of the Entero-bacteriaceae remains a problem in laboratories deal-ing with large numbers of bacterial isolates and with limited available resources for extensive biochemical testing. Donovan (1966) proposed a simple screening medium for the differentiation of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp</b> from other Gram-negative bacilli on the basis of motility, hydrogen sulphide production, and fermentation of inositol. Chadwick et al (1974) incorporated inositol fermentation in a proposed comprehensive bio-chemical identification of hospital Enterobacteria, and Davis and Matsen (1974) used a MacConkey agar with inositol instead of lactose for the detection of Klebsiellae in clinical specimens. In this laboratory a preliminary evaluation of the Klebsiella screening medium of Donovan (1966) highlighted a number of problems in the interpreta-tion of inositol fermentation and organism motility. This paper described experiments which demon-strate the variation of inositol fermentation by Klebsiellae on one screening medium (Donovan, 1966). Modifications of this medium were designed to improve the differentiation of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp</b> from other Enterobacteria in 16 - 24 hour incubations...|$|R

The present study aimed to isolate bacteriophages against <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> and evaluate their efficacy against antibiotic-resistant species. Seventy-two antibiotic-resistant <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> were isolated from samples of patients who referred to the Ghaem Hospital (Mashhad, Iran). Lytic bacteriophages against <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> were isolated from wastewater of the septic tank of the same hospital. Bactericidal activity of phages against resistant <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> was tested in both liquid (tube method; after 1 and 24 h of incubation) and solid (double-layer agar plate method; after 24 h of incubation) phases.

From these, at least 24 % showed multidrug resistance. Among the microorganisms isolated from the individual tanks, 85 % or more were resistant to ampicillin. The ESBL phenotype and the blaTEM gene were detected in strains of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> isolated from both tanks. It was concluded that contamination of milk with resistant total coliforms, and especially the storage of raw milk from several small producers in the collective bulk tank increase the risk of contamination. O leite adequado ao consumo deve possuir qualidade higiênica, valor nutritivo e a manutenção das propriedades organolépticas. O isolamento de coliformes totais e/ou fecais de leite bovino é considerado um indicador de sanidade e de boas práticas de manejo, podendo ser usado como indicador de qualidade. Este estudo teve como objetivo isolar, identificar e observar o perfil de resistência de coliformes presentes em tanques de refrigeração coletivos e individuais de acondicionamento de leite. Foram colhidas 89 amostras de leite de tanques coletivos e isolados 21 <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.,</b> uma Escherichia coli (E. coli) e 29 Enterobacter spp., e 102 amostras de leite de tanques individuais das quais foram isolados uma <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> e sete Enterobacter spp. Dos tanques coletivos, aproximadamente 47 % de <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> e Enterobacter spp. foram resistentes para cefalexina e 30 % para ampicilina. Destes, no mínimo 24 % apresentaram multirresistência. Entre os isolados de tanques individuais, 85 % ou mais apresentaram resistência para ampicilina.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the sensibility and resistance profiles to antibiotics of pathogens isolated in a hospital unit of food and nutrition. It was evaluated as sample spots, with repetitions, environmental samples, utensils, equipment, manipulators’ hands and usually diet that would be served to the hospitalized patients. In the evaluated samples, coagulase positive Staphylococcus (CPS) and Gram negative bacillus were enumerated, and also, it was possible to isolate <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp</b> and Escherichia coli. The antimicrobial of less efficiency for CPS was oxacillin and penicillin-G, and for <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp</b> ampicillin e cephalothin. It should be emphasized that it was found strains multiresistants of CPS, <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp</b> and E. coli.

40|$|Background Asymptomatic {{carriage}} {{has been}} recognised {{as an important}} risk factor for infection caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria. A 14 % global prevalence of Extended-Spectrum Beta-lactamase (ESBL) carriage was recently reported, but large intra-and interregional variations were observed. We investigated the faecal carriage rates of ESBL-, AmpC-producing and ciprofloxacin non-susceptible Escherichia coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> in healthy Norwegians. Methods Rectal samples were obtained from 284 volunteers, together with demographic data and information on recent travel history. The rectal samples were screened by selective plating and E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> identified using MALDI-TOF. Phenotypic and molecular characterization of resistant isolates was also performed. Results ESBL- or AmpC-producing E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> were isolated from 4. 9 % and 3. 2 % of the study population, respectively. Carriage of ciprofloxacin non-susceptible isolates was detected in 9. 9 % of the volunteers. Molecular typing of ESBL/plasmid-mediated AmpC (pAmpC) -producing isolates suggested an allodemic situation rather than the dissemination of a specific clone in the Norwegian community. In concurrence with previous findings, travel to South-East Asia was associated with increased risk of carrying resistant E. coli or <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.,</b> highlighting the contribution of factors such as increased global mobility in erasing the boundaries between healthcare and community settings {{when it comes to}} spread of resistant bacteria. Conclusions Overall, our study recognised Norway as a low-incidence country for faecal carriage of resistant bacteria among healthy individuals. Furthermore, our work denoted the importance of healthy humans as a reservoir for transmission of antibiotic resistant E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp...</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the in vitro activity of antibiotics, including arbekacin, cefminox, fosfomycin and biapenem {{which are all}} still unavailable in India, against Gram-negative clinical isolates. We prospectively collected and tested all consecutive isolates of Escherichia coli, <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.,</b> Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Acinetobacter spp. from blood, urine and sputum samples between March and November 2012. The minimum inhibition concentration (MIC) of 16 antibiotics {{was determined by the}} broth micro-dilution method. Overall 925 isolates were included; 211 E. coli, 207 <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.,</b> 153 P. aeruginosa, and 354 Acinetobacter spp. The MIC 50 and MIC 90 were high for cefminox, biapenem and arbekacin for all pathogens but interpretative criteria were not available. The MIC 50 was categorized as susceptible for a couple of antibiotics, including piperacillin/tazobactam, carbapenems and amikacin, for E. coli, <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> and P. aeruginosa. However, for Acinetobacter spp., the MIC 50 was categorized as susceptible only for colistin. On the other hand, fosfomycin was the only antibiotic that inhibited 90 % of E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> isolates, while 90 % of P. aeruginosa isolates were inhibited only by colistin. Finally, 90 % of Acinetobacter spp. isolates were not inhibited by any antibiotic tested. Fosfomycin and colistin might be promising antibiotics for the treatment of infections due to E. coli or <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> and P. aeruginosa, respectively, in India; however, clinical trials should first corroborate the in vitro findings. The activity of tigecycline should be evaluated, as this is commonly used as last-resort option for the treatment of multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{diagnostic}} {{utility of}} the AmpC β-lactamase inhibitors LN- 2 - 128, 48 - 1220, and Syn 2190 in combination with cefotetan (CTT) or cefoxitin in a disk test {{for the detection of}} clinical isolates of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> producing plasmid-mediated AmpC β-lactamases (pAmpCs) was evaluated. The combination of Syn 2190 and CTT had a sensitivity of 91 %, a specificity of 100 %, and a reproducibility of 100 % and showed the best potential of using an inhibitor for detection of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> producing pAmpCs...|$|R
40|$|Context: Carbapenemase {{production}} {{is an important}} mechanism responsible for carbapenem resistance. Aims: Phenotypic detection and differentiation of types of carbapenemase in carbapenem resistant Enterobacteriaceae is important for proper infection control and appropriate patient management. Settings and Design: We planned a study to determine the occurrence of Class A Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC type) and Class B Metallo-β-lactamase (MBL type) carbapenemase in hospital and community. Materials and Methods: Clinical isolates of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella species and simultaneously evaluate different phenotypic methods for detection of carbapenemases. Results: It was observed that 20. 72 % clinical isolates of E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> were resistant to carbapenem on screening of which, 14. 64 % were E. coli and 29. 69 % were <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> Using phenotypic confirmatory tests the occurrence of carbapenemase production {{was found to be}} 87. 01 % in E. coli and 91. 51 % in <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> using both modified Hodge test (MHT) and combined disk test (CDT) using imipenem-ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid. Conclusions: Both MBL and KPC type carbapenemases were seen among clinical isolates of E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> CDT is simple, rapid and technically less demanding procedure, which can be used in all clinical laboratories. Supplementing MHT with CDT is reliable phenotypic tests to identify the class A and class B carbapenemase producers...|$|R
40|$|The {{prevalence}} of ESBL was determined among isolates of Escherichia coli (n = 571) and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> (n = 196) collected during a 1 -week study period in 8 university and 3 large regional laboratories {{all over the}} Netherlands. 18 isolates were positive {{for at least one}} of the screening tests used, i. e., VITEK-ES BL, E-test ESBL and MIC ratio of ceftazidime/ceftazidime-clavulanic acid, cefotaxime/cefotaxime-clavulanic acid. In 5 of these 18 putative ESBLs no betalactamase production was detectable. A TEM type was found in three E. coli and two <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> An SHV type was present in five <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> In one E. coli and one Klebsiella pneumoniae both enzymes were present. In one Klebsiella oxytoca neither of the two enzymes was present. Using PCR for both ESBL TEM and ESBL SHV, an SHV ESBL was found in one E. coli and four Klebsiella isolates. The mutations at position 238 and 240 were already described. In one E, coli isolate a TEM ESBL was found with three mutations, at position 21, 164 acid 265. These mutations were already described in other ESBLs but not in this combination suggesting a new TEM ESBL. The overall {{prevalence of}} ESBL producing E. coli and <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> was less than 1 % (6 out of 767) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{designed}} to determine the prevalence and extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) types in clinical isolates of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> at a university hospital located in the Brazilian southern region (Ribeirao Preto, Sao Paulo) as well as their antibiotic susceptibility and genetic profiles. This study included 147 non-repeat <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> isolates collected from January to June 2000, of which 23 K. pneumoniae and 8 K. oxytoca were selected as ESBL producers by using the Oxoid combination disk method and Etest ESBL strip. beta-lactamases were characterized by IEF, PCR and sequencing assays using primers for ESBL genes. Antibiotic susceptibility was evaluated by MicroScan system. Dissemination of two major clones of ESBL-producing <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> occurred in the hospital. According to the results obtained in this study there was a clonal spread of CTX-M-producing K. oxytoca in five clinics and dissemination of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae in the nursery and pediatrics wards...|$|R
40|$|<b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> are {{a common}} cause of {{mastitis}}, milk loss, and culling on dairy farms. Control of Klebsiella mastitis is largely based on prevention of exposure of the udder to the pathogen. To identify critical control points for mastitis prevention, potential Klebsiella sources and transmission cycles in the farm environment were investigated, including oro-fecal transmission, transmission via the indoor environment, and transmission via the outdoor environment. A total of 305 samples was collected from 3 dairy farms in upstate New York {{in the summer of}} 2007, and included soil, feed crops, feed, water, rumen content, feces, bedding, and manure from alleyways and holding pens. <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> were detected in 100 % of rumen samples, 89 % of water samples, and approximately 64 % of soil, feces, bedding, alleyway, and holding pen samples. Detection of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> in feed crops and feed was less common. Genotypic identification of species using rpoB sequence data showed that Klebsiella pneumoniae was the most common species in rumen content, feces, and alleyways, whereas Klebsiella oxytoca, Klebsiella variicola, and Raoultella planticola were the most frequent species among isolates from soil and feed crops. Random amplified polymorphic DNA-based strain typing showed heterogeneity of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> in rumen content and feces, with a median of 4 strains per 5 isolates. Observational and bacteriological data support the existence of an oro-fecal transmission cycle, which is primarily maintained through direct contact with fecal contamination or through ingestion of contaminated drinking water. Fecal shedding of <b>Klebsiella</b> <b>spp.</b> contributes to pathogen loads in the environment, including bedding, alleyways, and holding pens. Hygiene of alleyways and holding pens is an important component of Klebsiella control on dairy farms...|$|R
