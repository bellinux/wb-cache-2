5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions—two on Friday and a {{third on}} Saturday—were held before the Sunday race. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions lasted ninety minutes each; the third, one-hour session was held on Saturday morning. Mercedes conducted race simulations {{to see how the}} cars would behave with a heavy fuel load. Rosberg was fastest in the first practice session with a lap time of one minute and 35.461 seconds, ahead of teammate Hamilton in second. Alonso was third-fastest, ahead of Bottas and Kimi Räikkönen. Magnussen, Ricciardo, Button and Daniil Kvyat rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Verstappen's run ended early when he pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at the S curves with smoke billowing from his engine because of a broken <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> and Merhi spun at turn 13 (causing Bottas to swerve to avoid him).|$|E

5000|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> on NHRA Top Fuel and Funny Car drag racing {{engines are}} made of Inconel.

500|$|Two inlet and two <b>exhaust</b> poppet <b>valves</b> of [...] "K.E.965" [...] steel per cylinder. Both {{the inlet}} and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> have {{hardened}} [...] "stellited" [...] ends; while the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> also have sodium-cooled stems, and heads protected with a [...] "Brightray" [...] (nickel-chromium) coating. Each valve is kept closed {{by a pair}} of concentric coil-springs. A single, seven-bearing camshaft, located on the top of each cylinder head operates 24 individual steel rockers; 12 pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner, intake side of the head to actuate the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves,</b> the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the head to actuate the inlet valves.|$|R
50|$|The <b>exhaust</b> poppet <b>valves</b> are on {{the other}} side of the engine. Arranged symmetrically at the top of the engine the inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are interchangeable.|$|R
25|$|Helmets {{also have}} a {{spring-loaded}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> which allows excess air to leave the helmet. The spring force is adjustable by the diver to prevent the suit from deflating completely or over-inflating and the diver being floated uncontrollably to the surface. Some helmets have an extra manual <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> known as a spit-cock. This allows the diver to vent excess air when {{he is in a}} position where the main exhaust can not function correctly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> failure, like {{demand valve}} failure, can {{be dealt with}} by opening the free flow valve and {{ensuring}} a constant outflow of air.|$|E
25|$|Helmet flood. Depending on the {{severity}} of the flood, this can range from an annoyance to an emergency. A slow leak can be controlled by opening the free flow valve, which will drive a moderate flow of water out of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> A neck dam failure usually has this effect.|$|E
25|$|Wet {{breathing}}: Wet {{breathing is}} caused by water getting into the regulator and compromising breathing comfort and safety. Water can leak into the second stage body through damaged soft parts like torn mouthpieces, damaged <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and perforated diaphragms, through cracked housings, or through poorly sealing or fouled <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|R
50|$|This is {{the most}} common type of {{multi-valve}} head, with two <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and two similar (or slightly larger) inlet valves. This design allows similar breathing as compared to a three-valve head, and as the small <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> allow high RPM, this design is very suitable for high power outputs.|$|R

25|$|There is a {{technical}} problem with {{recovery of the}} exhaled gas. Simply venting it to a return hose through a non-return valve will not work, as the hose must be maintained at exactly the ambient pressure at {{the depth of the}} helmet, otherwise the gas from the helmet will either free-flow out under pressure, or not flow out at all because of back pressure. This obstacle is overcome by using an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> working on the same principle as the demand valve, which opens the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> by using the leverage of a diaphragm sensing the pressure difference between the helmet interior pressure and the ambient pressure, This only requires the pressure in the reclaim hose to be lower than ambient at the diver to function. The same principle is used in a diving chamber's Built-in breathing system (BIBS).|$|E
25|$|The scuba mask (half-mask) is {{equalised}} during descent by periodically exhaling {{through the}} nose. During ascent it will automatically equalise by leaking excess air round the edges. A helmet or {{full face mask}} will automatically equalise as any pressure differential will either vent through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> or open the demand valve and release air into the low-pressure space.|$|E
25|$|Cutter {{made two}} more war patrols as Executive Officer of Pompano, {{operating}} {{in the vicinity of}} Okinawa and Honshū, respectively. The boat narrowly escaped destruction on 9 August 1942, when a Japanese depth charge unseated an engine <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> causing major flooding and driving her into the bottom near the Japanese coast. Fortunately, the crew managed to surface the boat and creep away.|$|E

Each valve is held closed by a pair of concentric coil springs. A single, seven-bearing camshaft, located centrally on the top of each cylinder head operates 24 individual steel rockers; 12 pivoting from a rocker shaft on the inner, intake side of the block to actuate the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves,</b> the others pivoting from a shaft on the exhaust side of the block to actuate the inlet valves.|$|R

25|$|The 618 {{features}} liquid-cooled {{cylinder heads}} and cylinders with a rotary valve inlet and an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> Cooling is via {{one or two}} externally mounted radiators. Lubrication is by use of pre-mixed fuel and oil at 50:1 or oil injection. The 618 has dual Ducati capacitor discharge ignition systems and is equipped with two piston-type carburetors. It uses a manifold-driven pneumatic fuel pump to provide fuel pressure.|$|E
25|$|Drive {{was taken}} from the rocking arm of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> a lever fixed to the valve housing {{transmitting}} impulses to the gun through a rod. Designed by Leutnant Otto Bernatzik, it was geared down to deliver a firing impulse every second revolution of the propeller, and fired at about 380 to 400 rounds per gun. As with other gears synchronizing the Schwarzlose gun, firing became erratic at high engine speeds.|$|E
25|$|Small {{variations}} in pressure between the delivered gas and the ambient pressure at the lungs can be tolerated. These {{can result from}} the trim of the diver in the water, {{the position of the}} diaphragm operating the demand valve, the position of the counterlungs in a rebreather, cracking pressure and flow resistance of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> or intentional overpressure in a full-face mask or helmet, intended {{to reduce the risk of}} contaminated water leaking into the breathing apparatus through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> A consistent variation in delivered pressure difference does not affect the work of breathing - the whole graph is shifted up or down without change to the enclosed area - but the effort required for inhalation and exhalation are perceptibly different from normal, and if excessive, may make it difficult or impossible to breathe. Free-flow systems inherently operate under a positive pressure relative to the head, to allow controlled exhaust flow, but not necessarily to the lungs in the upright diver. Snorkel breathing is inherently negative pressure breathing, as the lungs of the swimmer are at least partly below the surface of the water.|$|E

25|$|Four-stroke {{reciprocating}} {{engines are}} not very suitable for use with hydrogen fuel. The hydrogen can misfire on hot parts like the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and spark plugs. Another problem concerns the hydrogenate attack on the lubricating film in reciprocating engines. In a Wankel engine, this problem is circumvented by using a ceramic apex seal against a ceramic surface, {{so that there is}} no oil film to suffer hydrogenate attack. The piston shell must be lubricated and cooled with oil. This substantially increases the lubricating oil consumption in a four-stroke hydrogen engine.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid-1940s, the {{traditional}} horizontal four-stroke single-cylinder 500cc engines were fitted with one overhead and one side valve but {{contrary to the}} usual practice of having inlet over exhaust (IOE), this employed the side valve for induction and the overhead valve for exhaust. Also unusual was the adoption of only one hairspring (type of valve spring) to close the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> These were the highest performance engines Moto Guzzi sold to the general public. By contrast, the company supplied the official racing team and private racers with higher performance racing machines with varying overhead cam, multi-valve configurations and cylinder designs.|$|E
25|$|The {{open circuit}} demand system {{exhausts}} gas {{to the environment}} at ambient pressure (or a very small difference from ambient pressure required to open the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve).</b> As a result, all exhaled gas is lost to the surroundings. For most surface orientated commercial diving where air is the breathing gas in use, this is no problem, as air is cheap and freely available. Even with nitrox it is generally more cost effective to use open circuit, as oxygen is an easily available and relatively inexpensive gas, and blending nitrox is technologically simple, both to mix and to analyse.|$|E
5000|$|All 645 {{engines are}} {{two-stroke}} 45-degree V-engines. Each cylinder is of 645 cuin L displacement, hence the name; with a bore of 9+1/16 in, {{a stroke of}} 10 in and a compression ratio of 14.5:1. The engine is a uniflow design with four poppet-type <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> in the cylinder head and charge air scavenging ports within {{the sides of the}} cylinders. All engines use a single overhead camshaft per bank, with <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> operated by two cam lobes (each of which operates two <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> through a [...] "bridge") and one cam lobe to operate the Unit injector which is {{in the center of the}} four <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> Rocker arms are roller-equipped to eliminate friction while hydraulic valve actuators are used to eliminate valve lash. Post-1995 710 engines employ Electronic Unit injectors, however these injectors still utilize a camshaft-actuated piston pump, as on non-EFI injectors.|$|R

25|$|The {{automatic}} diluent valve (ADV) {{is used in}} a rebreather to add gas to {{the loop}} to compensate automatically for volume reduction due to pressure increase with greater depth or to make up gas lost from the system by the diver exhaling through the nose while clearing the mask or {{as a method of}} flushing the loop. They are often provided with a purge button to allow manual flushing of the loop. The ADV is virtually identical in construction and function to the open circuit demand valve, but does not have an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> Some passive semi-closed circuit rebreathers use the ADV to add gas to the loop to compensate for a portion of the gas discharged automatically during the breathing cycle as a way of maintaining a suitable oxygen concentration.|$|E
25|$|A {{free flow}} helmet {{supplies}} a continuous flow of {{air to the}} diver, and he breathes this as it flows past. Work of breathing is minimal, but flow rate must be high if the diver works hard, and this is noisy, affecting communications and requiring hearing protection to avoid damage to the ears. This type of helmet is popular where divers {{have to work hard}} in relatively shallow water for long periods. It is also useful when diving in contaminated environments, where the helmet is sealed onto a dry suit, and the entire system is kept at a slight positive pressure by adjusting the back-pressure of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> to ensure that there is no leakage into the helmet. This type of helmet is often large in volume, and as it is attached to the suit, it does not move with the head. The diver must move his body to face anything he wants to see. For this reason the faceplate is large and there is often an upper window or side windows to improve the field of vision.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s single-hose {{regulators}} {{started to take}} over as the standard, and this complicated the buddy breathing procedure. The single hose <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> position {{at the bottom of}} most DVs made it necessary to offset the recipient to the right side when face to face, or to the left when side by side. The standard procedure of continuous exhalation during ascent to avoid lung over-pressure injury could leave the diver with insufficient air to clear the regulator, so it was necessary to hold the DV in a way that did not obstruct the recipient from accessing the purge button, as the single hose would not normally free flow when raised above the head. The increasing popularity of the buoyancy compensator was another complication, as it is necessary to periodically vent it during an ascent to avoid a runaway expansion of the contents and an uncontrolled buoyant ascent. This requires the use of one hand. the other is needed to control the regulator and hold on to the other diver, a moderately complex set of simultaneous tasks. It is possible to coordinate these activities, but this requires greater skill than with the original procedure, and therefore more intensive training to perform reliably. Since running out of air was becoming less common, the procedure was practiced less often, and skills generally deteriorated. The use of a secondary (octopus) second stage or a bailout cylinder removes the necessity for this complex and relatively stressful procedure.|$|E
