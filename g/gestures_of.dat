5|$|Daksinakaali, also spelled Dakshinakaali, is {{the most}} popular form of Kaali in Bengal. There are various {{versions}} for the origin of the name Dakshinakaali. Dakshina refers to the gift given to a priest before performing a ritual or to one's guru. Such gifts are traditionally given with the right hand. Daksinakaali's two right hands are usually depicted in <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> blessing and giving of boons. One version of the origin of her name comes from the story of Yama, lord of death, who lives in the south (daksina). When Yama heard Kali's name, he fled in terror, and so those who worship Kali are said to be able to overcome death itself.|$|E
5|$|Asumi's {{elementary}} and middle school classmate Shinnosuke Fuchuya also enters the academy much to her surprise. He defended Asumi from ridicule by other classmates throughout their childhood despite occasionally teasing her as well, and {{it has been suggested that}} he sees her as a romantic interest. The two eventually befriend three other students in the astronaut training program. Shu Suzuki, who is named student representative for the astronaut program, has an easygoing personality. He wears a distinctive face by shaving his eyebrows as a symbol of defiance against his father. Kei Oumi befriends Asumi during the academy's entrance examination and is portrayed with an outgoing personality and a deep sense of loyalty toward her friends. Marika Ukita initially responds coldly toward <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> friendship, but she moves into Asumi's dormitory following an argument with her father. The five students later make a promise to complete the astronaut program together as their friendship grows stronger. After three years in the astronaut program, Asumi is chosen out of eleven remaining students to take part in Japan's second human spaceflight mission, making her, at the age of eighteen, the youngest person to go into space.|$|E
5|$|Brett's replacement, Major General George Kenney, {{arrived in}} the theater in August, and Walker was {{appointed}} Commanding General, V Bomber Command, Fifth Air Force on 3 September, with his headquarters in Townsville. At this time, Port Moresby was subject to frequent Japanese air raids, so the bombers were generally based in the Townsville area and staged through Port Moresby to minimize their chance of loss or damage on the ground. In mid-September 1942, {{at the height of}} the Kokoda Track campaign, Kenney sent Walker to Port Moresby for a few weeks to direct the advanced echelon, to give Whitehead a rest and Walker more experience. Walker attempted to lift morale by improving the men's living conditions. He made a point of small <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> fellowship, such as standing in line with the men at meal times. But what endeared him most to his men was his willingness to share the dangers as well as their hardships, by flying a mission a week on average. In October, General Douglas MacArthur gave Kenney a dressing down for flying over the Owen Stanley Range. In turn, Kenney ordered Walker, Wilson and Whitehead not to fly any more missions. For a variety of reasons, all four of them eventually disobeyed their orders.|$|E
50|$|The Dakshinamnaya {{mentions}} that Haridra Ganapati has six arms {{and sits on}} a jewelled throne, {{in addition to his}} yellow colour and yellow vestments. His three right hands hold the ankusha and display the krodha-mudra (the <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> anger) and abhayamudra (the <b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> protection). His left hands carry the pasha, a parashu (battle-axe) and displays the varadamudra (<b>gesture</b> <b>of</b> boon-giving).|$|R

5|$|The umpires {{reported}} Waddington to the cricket {{committee of}} the MCC for inciting the crowd through his appeals and <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> displeasure when batsmen were not given out. Waddington maintained his innocence but the MCC supported the umpires, finding him guilty of dissent, and the Yorkshire president Lord Hawke persuaded him {{to write a letter}} of apology to the MCC secretary. After the game, Middlesex threatened to cancel their future matches against Yorkshire; rumours circulated that the Yorkshire captain Geoffrey Wilson had offered to resign and that Waddington would be dropped. Later in 1924, Yorkshire had another controversial match, this time against Surrey, where there were disputes on the field, but no official complaint was made. The editor of Wisden suggested that a handful of players were the root cause of Yorkshire's problem; Geoffrey Wilson resigned {{at the end of the}} season, and these events probably cost Macaulay a place in the England Test team. The Yorkshire cricketer and journalist Bill Bowes later recalled a story in circulation that Waddington had deliberately tripped and injured the Middlesex player J. W. Hearne around this period, although he did not specify if it was during the 1924 Sheffield match. Waddington ended the season with 69 wickets at an average of 21.55, but appeared less effective than before his injury.|$|E
25|$|Steven Best and Douglas Kellner {{identify}} Rauschenberg and Jasper Johns {{as part of}} {{the transitional}} phase, influenced by Marcel Duchamp, between modernism and postmodernism. Both used images of ordinary objects, or the objects themselves, in their work, while retaining the abstraction and painterly <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> high modernism.|$|E
25|$|Multiple Indonesian {{artists and}} journalists engaged in <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> {{solidarity}} for the victims. Indonesian singer Tompi, {{who was born}} in Aceh, opened a charity line for the victims. Raisa, a famous Indonesian singer, sent her condolences to the victims, alongside Haruka Nakagawa, from JKT48. A message of condolence was also sent from Vidi Aldiano.|$|E

25|$|The {{reactions}} to DAS GEDICHT Vol. 8 ranged from simple <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> dismay to crass invectives against the editors and even amounted to multiple death threats, as the sample recording shows. The editorial board had already anticipated such reactions and added little perforated paper screens {{that could be}} individually used to censor displeasing lines while reading.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-to-late 1990s the <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> Taiwanization were {{increasingly}} adopted by pro-unification figures who, while supporting the Chinese nationalism of Chiang Kai-shek, {{saw it as}} appropriate, or at least advisable, to display more appreciation for cultures of Taiwan. Pro-unification politicians such as James Soong, {{the former head of}} the Government Information Office who once oversaw the limitation of Taiwanese dialects, began speaking in Hoklo on semi-formal occasions.|$|E

25|$|This {{incident}} escalated {{into an open}} revolt. The {{residents of}} Albayzín barricaded the streets and armed themselves. An angry crowd marched to Cisneros' house, apparently for an assault. This crowd later dispersed, but over the following days the revolt become more organized. The population of Albayzín elected their own officials and leaders. In the standoff that ensued, the archbishop Hernando de Talavera and the Captain-General Marquis de Tendilla attempted to defuse the situation through negotiations and <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> good-will. After ten days, the uprising ended as the Muslims handed in their weapons and handed over the constable's killers, who were promptly executed.|$|E
25|$|A {{propaganda}} {{war between}} Pakistan and India ensued in which Yahya threatened war against India if that country made {{an attempt to}} seize any part of Pakistan. Yahya also asserted that Pakistan could count on its American and Chinese friends. At the same time, Pakistan tried to ease {{the situation in the}} East Wing. Belatedly, it replaced Tikka, whose military tactics had caused such havoc and human loss of life, with the more restrained Lieutenant General A.A.K. Niazi. A moderate Bengali, Abdul Malik, was installed as the civilian governor of East Pakistan. These belated <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> appeasement did not yield results or change world opinion.|$|E
25|$|Even {{what we hear}} must be {{attached}} to a visual image. To help recall something we have heard rather than seen, we should attach to their words the appearance, facial expression, and <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> the person speaking {{as well as the}} appearance of the room. The speaker should therefore create strong visual images, through expression and gesture, which will fix the impression of his words. All the rhetorical textbooks contain detailed advice on declamatory gesture and expression; this underscores the insistence of Aristotle, Avicenna, and other philosophers, on the primacy and security for memory of the visual over all other sensory modes, auditory, tactile, and the rest.|$|E

25|$|An {{influential}} book by Leo Steinberg, The Sexuality of Christ in Renaissance Art and in Modern Oblivion (1983, 2nd edition 1996), {{explores the}} explicit depiction of Christ's penis in art, which he argues became a new {{focus of attention}} in late medieval art, initially covered only by a transparent veil in the early 14th century, and by {{the second half of}} the century completely uncovered, and often being the subject of the gaze or <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> other figures in the scene. This emphasis is, among other things, a demonstration of Christ's humanity when it appears in depictions of the Madonna and Child and other scenes of Christ's childhood, and also a foreshadowing of Christ's Passion to come in the context of the Circumcision.|$|E
25|$|Isaac {{failed to}} take {{advantage}} of the chaos of the Crusaders army. As it marched across the Anatolian peninsula, it encountered frequent Turkish raids, despite official <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> friendship from the Sultanate of Rûm under Kilij Arslan II. Not bearing to stand by and do nothing, Frederick sacked Iconium, capital of the Sultanate, before moving on. Isaac did not seize the initiative and Kilij Arslan II returned later to reclaim his fallen capital. Frederick's army would later slowly but surely disband after the Holy Roman Emperor was found dead (presumed to have either drowned in a river, suffered a heart attack or perhaps both). More looting and damage would be done by these weary soldiers as they retreated back to Europe.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Imam Hasan, Imam Husayn {{and his family were}} {{increasingly}} worried about the religious and political persecution that was becoming commonplace under the reign of Muawiya's son, Yazid. Amidst this turmoil in 680, Husayn along with the women and children of his family, upon receiving invitational letters and <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> support by Kufis, wished to go to Kufa and confront Yazid as an intercessor on part of the citizens of the empire. However, he was stopped by Yazid's army in Karbala during the month of Muharram. His family was starved and deprived of water and supplies, until eventually the army came in on the tenth day and martyred Husayn and his companions, and enslaved the rest of the women and family, taking them to Kufa.|$|E

25|$|Kathak {{is found}} in three {{distinct}} forms, named after the cities where the Kathak dance tradition evolved – Jaipur, Banaras and Lucknow. Stylistically, the Kathak dance form emphasizes rhythmic foot movements, adorned with small bells (Ghungroo), and the movement harmonized to the music. The legs and torso are generally straight, and {{the story is told}} through a developed vocabulary based on the <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> arms and upper body movement, facial expressions, stage movements, bends and turns. The main focus of the dance becomes the eyes and the foot movements. The eyes work as a medium of communication of the story the dancer is trying to communicate. With the eyebrows the dancer gives various facial expressions. The difference between the sub-traditions is the relative emphasis between acting versus footwork, with Lucknow style emphasizing acting and Jaipur style famed for its spectacular footwork.|$|E
25|$|In the 15th and 16th centuries, the High Renaissance {{gave rise}} to a stylised art known as Mannerism. In place of the {{balanced}} compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art {{at the dawn of the}} 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> Piero della Francesca and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of Pontormo and the emotional intensity of El Greco. In the 17th century, among the greatest painters of Italian Baroque are Caravaggio, Annibale Carracci, Artemisia Gentileschi, Mattia Preti, Carlo Saraceni and Bartolomeo Manfredi. Subsequently, in the 18th century, Italian Rococo was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as Giovanni Battista Tiepolo and Canaletto. Italian Neoclassical sculpture focused, with Antonio Canova's nudes, on the idealist aspect of the movement.|$|E
25|$|A {{spate of}} suicide bombings {{reinforced}} the Likud position for security. Hamas {{claimed responsibility for}} most of the bombings. As Prime Minister, Netanyahu raised many questions about many central premises of the Oslo Accords. One of his main points was disagreement with the Oslo premise that the negotiations should proceed in stages, meaning that concessions should be made to Palestinians before any resolution was reached on major issues, such as the status of Jerusalem, and the amending of the Palestinian National Charter. Oslo supporters had claimed that the multi-stage approach would build goodwill among Palestinians and would propel them to seek reconciliation when these major issues were raised in later stages. Netanyahu said that these concessions only gave encouragement to extremist elements, without receiving any tangible gestures in return. He called for tangible <b>gestures</b> <b>of</b> Palestinian goodwill in return for Israeli concessions. Despite his stated differences with the Oslo Accords, Prime Minister Netanyahu continued their implementation, but his Premiership saw a marked slow-down in the peace process.|$|E
