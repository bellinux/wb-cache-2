50|$|Emerson {{manufactures}} a {{scroll compressor}} that {{is capable of}} varying the refrigerant flow as per requirement. Instead of fixing the scrolls together permanently, the scrolls are allowed to move apart periodically. As the scrolls move apart, the motor continues to turn but the scrolls lose the ability to compress refrigerant, thus motor power is reduced when the scroll compressor is not pumping. By alternating the two different working states: the loaded state and the unloaded state. A solenoid contracts and expands the rotating scroll and/or the <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll,</b> using axial compliance. The controller modifies the load time, and the unload time, matching the capacity of the compressor to the load requested. This type of scroll compressors while offering variable capacity control, normally down to 20% of the full flow, can suffer from a significant loss of efficiency especially toward the lower range of the capacity control.|$|E

40|$|Scroll {{compressors}} {{are widely}} used in room air conditioning cycles, package air conditioning cycles, refrigeration, water heater and automobile air conditioning cycles as well as air compressors, helium compressors and vacuum pump. There are two main leakage paths in a compression chamber formed by a <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll</b> and an orbiting scroll. One is the leakage path through a radial clearance between the wraps of fixed and orbiting scroll. The leakage through the radial clearance is prevented by pressing the orbiting scroll radially against the <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll</b> by a mechanism such as a compliance mechanism. Oil inside the compression chamber also has the sealing effect and reduces the leakage through the radial clearance. Another leakage path is an axial clearance which is the clearance between a tip of the scroll wrap and a base plate. A tip seal {{is often used to}} prevent the leakage through the axial clearance. Although there have been many studies on the tip seal, the seal mechanism of the tip seal is not thoroughly clarified yet, and the influence of design parameters on efficiency of the tip seal is unclear. In addition, the relationship between the sealing effect and a frictional loss of the tip seal is also not validated well. In this study, a test apparatus which can evaluate the sealing effect and the frictional loss of the tip seal simultaneously is developed. The influence of several design parameters on the sealing effect and the frictional loss is examined with the test apparatus. By measuring pressure distribution around the tip seal in a tip seal groove, the sealing mechanism of the tip seal is clarified and a design guideline of the tip seal groove is obtained...|$|E

Simulation studies previously showed that compressor vapor injection leads to an increase of COP under exactly those conditions.

The work presented in this paper shows experimental results obtained from a commercially available 5 -ton heat pump that was retrofitted with a two-port vapor injected scroll compressor. The injection ports within the two compression pathways are located in the <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll</b> with different distance from the suction chamber. The vapor for the two injection pressure levels was generated using two vapor separators in a cascade configuration. This configuration made it necessary to not only control the superheat but also the liquid levels in the separators and subcooling of the refrigerant leaving the condenser. Baseline performance data of the heat pump without vapor injection was obtained and compared with that for the vapor injection and other system configurations. For the baseline, the injection lines to the compression pockets were plugged within the <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll</b> to reduce dead volume and re-expansion losses. Also, the vapor-separator section was shut off and bypassed. In the second step, the plugs were removed and a staged expansion process was performed using the separator section.

With identical compressor speed, a 28 % improvement in capacity was achieved at the 8. 33 °C (47 F) design point, when compared to the baseline without vapor injection. When the baseline and vapor injected system capacity were matched by adjusting compressor speed, the COP increased by up to 6 % at - 8. 33 °C (17 F).

40|$|This study {{presents}} an empirical method {{to calculate the}} bypass leakage mass flow rate along the tip seal in a scroll compressor. The leakage flows through small axial and radial clearances between the orbiting and <b>fixed</b> <b>scrolls</b> of scroll compressor were previously studied by Ishii et al. In these earlier studies, the pressure decay in the pressurized vessel due to leakage through the axial and radial clearances was measured using a maximum pressure of 3 MPa for CO 2 and 0. 6 MPa for R 22. The Darcy-Weisbach equation for incompressible, viscous fluid flow through the thin rectangular cross-section was applied to calculate the leakage mass flow rate that matched the pressure decay characteristics. The empirical friction factors were determined and plotted on a Moody diagram. As a result, the empirical friction factors for both axial and radial clearance leakage flows have been determined and shown to take on essentially the same value for both CO 2 and R 22, despite the significantly different working pressures. In contrast, the flow patterns in bypass leakage along the tip seal are so complicated that not even the leakage characteristics are known definitively. No method exists for calculating the bypass leakage mass flow rate. In the present study, a bypass leakage model was constructed, compatible with a production-type scroll compressor with a large cooling capacity. A similar test of the pressure decay in the pressurized vessel due to bypass leakages were conducted with the refrigerant gas R 410 A. The measured pressure decay characteristics were then simulated by the Darcy-Weisbach equation with the empirical friction factors from our previous study for the leakage flow through the axial clearance. In the present simulations of the measured pressure decay, the complicated flow patterns through bypass clearances were classified into two representative rectangular thin cross-section leakage passes, one with an equivalent width {{and the other with}} an equivalent length. Empirical friction factor values for the equivalent pass width and length were determined to match the measured pressure decays. As a result, the calculation of the bypass leakage flow rate along the tip seal in scroll compressors can be accomplished using a simple scheme in terms of the equivalent pass width and equivalent pass length for two representative leakage passes forming a thin rectangular cross-section and applying empirically determined friction factors,...|$|R

40|$|Performance {{analysis}} {{has been carried}} out on a high side scroll compressor having a <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll</b> equipped with a circular oil groove on its thrust surface. Oil is supplied to the oil groove through an intermittent opening from a high pressure oil reservoir formed inside the orbiting scroll hub. Oil in the groove is then delivered to both suction and back pressure chambers by pressure differentials and viscous pumping action of the orbiting scroll base plate. Mathematical modeling of this oil groove system has been incorporated into main compressor performance simulation program for optimum oil groove design. Pressure in the oil groove can be controlled by changing the oil passage area and oil groove configuration. With an enlarged oil passage, pressure in the oil groove increases due to increased flow rate, but pressure increase in the back pressure chamber is not that large, resulting in reduced friction loss at the thrust surface between the two scrolls. On the other hand, by increasing the oil passage area, oil content in the refrigerant flow increases, and the orbiting scroll stability could be negatively affected by oil groove pressure increase. Considering all these factors, EER could be improved by about 3. 6 % at ARI condition by optimum oil groove design...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{carbon dioxide}} (R- 744) {{as a natural}} {{refrigerant}} has been an attractive alternative refrigerant to replace HFC (hydrofluorocarbon) refrigerants currently used in air conditioning systems, due to the environmental concerns. Because new compressors with CO 2 {{are going to be}} operated under the high pressure, the tribology of sliding surfaces in the compressor becomes very important. To develop new compressor, especially scroll type, the friction and wear characteristics of sliding surfaces between a <b>fixed</b> <b>scroll</b> and an orbiting scroll in the scroll compressor were investigated in this paper. The sliding tests of pin-on-disk type were carried out between scroll surfaces under various sliding speeds, normal loads, surface roughness, and refrigerant pressures. Two types of lubricants were used, namely POE (polyol ester) oil and PAG (polyalkylene glycol) oil. The friction forces, wear amounts and surface temperatures were monitored during the tests. Test results showed that the wear amounts increased with increasing normal load and rotating speed, and also decreased with decreasing surface roughness. Also, the results of the sliding tests showed that using PAG oil has an advantage over POE oil in CO 2 environment. As the pressure of CO 2 refrigerant became higher, the amount of wear and coefficient of friction became larger in CO 2 /POE mixed environment, but wear and friction remained constant in CO 2 /PAG mixed environment. The wear coefficients in CO 2 /PAG and CO 2 /POE mixed environment were 8. 60 × 10 - 9 ㎣ /N·m and 2. 35 × 10 - 8 ㎣ /N·m, respectively...|$|E
