Also, the engines were constructed with the high-pressure cylinder aft and the low-pressure cylinder forward. This was done, according to the ship's chief engineer, A. W.

It is found that {{the width of the}} membrane b and lateral tension ratio c appears in the exact solution in a combined form ξ = b/√(c). This important similarity parameter implies that a larger width has the same frequencies as lowered lateral tension, therefore, this parameter greatly reduces the number of tables. For the vibrating vertical membranes, we find that when ξ increases generally, the frequencies decrease. For small ξ (small width or large lateral tension ratio), the <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes</b> are all n = 1, or a half-sine wave in the horizontal direction.

40|$|Both the ICTY and the ICC have {{struggled}} to combine vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes</b> of liability. At the ICTY, the question has primarily arisen {{within the context of}} ‘leadership-level’ JCEs and how to express their relationship with the Relevant Physical Perpetrators of the crimes. The ICC addressed the is-sue by combining indirect perpetration with co-perpetration to form a new mode of liability known as indirect co-perpetration. The following article argues that these novel combinations — vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes</b> of liability — cannot be simply asserted; they must be defended at the level of criminal law theory. Unfortunately, courts that have applied indirect co-perpetration have generally failed to offer this defense and have simply assumed that modes of liability can be combined at will. In an attempt to offer the needed justification, this article starts with the premise that modes of liability are ‘linking principles’ that link defendants with particular actions, and that combining these underlying linking principles requires a second-order linking principle. The most plausible candidate is the personality principle — a basic principle that recognizes the inherently collective nature of leadership-level groups dedicated to committing international crimes. Like Roxin’s theories describing the collective organizations that {{can be used as a}} form of indirect perpetration, the personality principle treats the horizontal leadership group as an organization or group agent whose collective nature potentially justifies the attribution of vertical modes of liability to all members of the horizontal group. Although this article does not defend the doctrine of indirect co-perpetration, it does conclude that combined vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes</b> of liability, whether at the ICTY or ICC, implicitly or covertly rely on something like the personality principle in order to justify collective attribution to the horizontal collective...|$|R

The study, based on numerical simulations and field data, focuses on two different campaigns: the first in autumn 2006, when the stratification was weak {{and there was a}} mild prevailing northeasterly wind, and the second in autumn 2013, when the stratification was strong and there was a mild easterly wind. Between these two campaigns, the sea surface level decreased by 3. 2  m. The periods of the fundamental modes were identified as 36 and 14  h, respectively. In both years, either second or third vertical modes were found. In general, the vertical modes in 2013 were higher because of the broad and strong pycnocline. For both years, {{it was found that the}} deep quasi-homogeneous mixed upper layer could sustain internal waves under mild wind conditions. The observed first and second vertical modes in 2006 are the first and second <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes</b> and the second and third vertical modes in 2013 are the second and third <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes.</b> The results suggest that, due to sea level variations, the neck connecting the Chernyshev Bay to the main body of the lake can become a critical location for the development of a nodal line for all principal oscillation modes.

However tiny amounts of random birefringence in such a fiber, or bending in the fiber, will cause a tiny amount of crosstalk from the vertical to the horizontal polarization mode. And since even a short portion of fiber, over which a tiny coupling coefficient may apply, is many thousands of wavelengths long, even that small coupling between the two polarization modes, applied coherently, {{can lead to a}} large power transfer to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>mode,</b> completely changing the wave's net state of polarization.

It is covered with a transparent armour which, my colleague George Barlow who has watched them in the wild tells me, even feels like that of a shrimp. The resemblance to a shrimp is probably, however, no part of their camouflage. Like many teleosts, shrimpfish swim around in co-ordinated groups, and with military synchrony. But unlike any other teleost you might think of, shrimpfish swim with the body pointing straight down. I don't mean they swim in a vertical direction. They swim in a horizontal direction, but with the body vertical. The whole effect of this synchronised swimming is a resemblance to a stand of weeds, or, even more strikingly, to the tall spines of a giant sea urchin, among which they often take refuge. Swimming head down is a deliberate decision. When alarmed, they are perfectly capable of flipping into more conventional, <b>horizontal</b> <b>mode</b> and they then flee with surprising speed."

40|$|Unmanned aerial {{vehicles}} (UAVs) {{have become}} increasingly more popular {{over the last few}} decades. Their fascinating capabilities and performance in accomplishing a specific task have made them indispensable for various civilian/commercial and military applications. The remarkable progress in advanced manufacturing techniques and electronic components have rendered development of small, intelligent and low-cost UAVs possible. Consequently, a significant amount of research effort has been devoted to design of UAVs with intelligent navigation and control systems. This thesis work focuses on nonlinear control of a quad tilt-wing unmanned aerial vehicle (SUAVI: Sabanci University Unmanned Aerial Vehicle). The aerial vehicle has the capability of vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL), and flying horizontally due to its tilt-wing mechanism. Nonlinear dynamical models for various flight modes are obtained. A hierarchical control system that includes vertical, transition and <b>horizontal</b> <b>modes</b> flight controllers is developed. In order to design these controllers, the dynamics of the aerial vehicle is divided into position and attitude subsystems. Several nonlinear position control methods are developed for different flight modes. For the vertical flight mode, integral sliding mode and PID based position controllers via dynamic inversion method are designed. Feedback linearization and integral sliding mode attitude controllers are also proposed for the attitude stabilization of the aerial vehicle in vertical, transition and <b>horizontal</b> flight <b>modes.</b> Simulations and several real flight experiments demonstrate success of the developed flight controllers...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{possible}} observational signatures {{of different types}} of kink modes (horizontal and vertical oscillations in their fundamental mode and second harmonic) that may arise in coronal loops, with the aim of determining how well the individual modes can be uniquely identified from time series of images. A simple, purely geometrical model is constructed to describe the different types of kink-mode oscillations. These are then `observed' from a given direction. In particular, we employ the 3 D geometrical parameters of 14 TRACE loops of transverse oscillations to try to identify the correct observed wave mode. We find that for many combinations of viewing and loop geometry it is not straightforward to distinguish between at least two types of kink modes just using time series of images. We also considered Doppler signatures and find that these can help obtain unique identifications of the oscillation modes when employed in combination with imaging. We then compare the modeled spatial signatures with the observations of 14 TRACE loops. We find that out of three oscillations previously identified as fundamental <b>horizontal</b> <b>mode</b> oscillations, two cases appear to be fundamental vertical mode oscillations (but possibly combined with the fundamental <b>horizontal</b> <b>mode),</b> and one case appears to be a combination of the fundamental vertical and horizontal modes, while in three cases {{it is not possible to}} clearly distinguish between the fundamental mode and the second-harmonic of the horizontal oscillation.
