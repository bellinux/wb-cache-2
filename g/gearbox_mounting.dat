5000|$|The {{engine was}} {{essentially}} a lightly {{modified version of the}} E-series unit found in the Maxi and Allegro. The main differences over the older engine are to the sump and <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounting</b> flange, which were adapted to accept a traditional [...] "end-on" [...] transmission unit which had been bought from Volkswagen in place of the traditional BMC transmission-in-sump arrangement.|$|E
50|$|However the insuperable {{problem was}} the {{proximity}} of the engine to the rear axle, and on 33 ft versions many different designs of drive-shaft were employed but no effective way was found of insulating the engine and gearbox from road shocks. Crosville had all of its 36 ft models converted with a revised engine and <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounting</b> closer to the rear cross member, allowing a longer universal-jointed drive shaft to be put in place, this arrangement was also applied to later long-wheelbase RU as built. To cover for vehicles being modified, Seddon Atkinson lent Crosville the prototype Pennine 7 (UBU72N), which remained with Crosville after the work was done.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} three bushing models are {{evaluated}} {{to find a}} best practice in modeling the mounting of wind turbine gearboxes. Parameter identification on measurements {{has been used to}} determine the bushing parameters for dynamic simulation of a gearbox including main shaft. The stiffness of the main components of the gearbox has been calculated. The torsional stiffness of the main shaft, gearbox and the mounting of the gearbox are of same order of magnitude, and eigenfrequency analysis clearly reveals that the stiffness of the <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounting</b> is of importance when modeling full wind turbine drivetrains...|$|E
40|$|Two {{mounting}} bolts pertaining to different accessory gearboxes {{were sent to}} the laboratory for analyzing the cause of failure. Investigation revealed that both the bolts have failed by fatigue; one under bending and the other under reverse bending. The fatigue cracks have initiated at the thread root in both the cases. No metallurgical and/or mechanical abnormalities were found responsible for the fatigue crack initiation and the fatigue was found to be stress related. Analysis showed that in one bolt, the fatigue crack initiation was accelerated due to bending stress resulting from the assembly stresses. In the other bolt, the reverse bending fatigue occurred during service due to high length to diameter ratio of the bolts. It appears that such failures in the present accessory <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounting</b> scheme is unavoidable. A detailed analysis of the failures has been presented in this report with a few recommendations for a possible improvement in the fatigue life of the {{mounting bolts}}...|$|E

50|$|Miss England II {{was built}} for Lord Wakefield in 1930, who had {{obtained}} a pair of new Rolls-Royce type R V-12 air-racing engines. Mounted aft of the cockpit, they turned a single propeller shaft via a <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> near the bow. The shaft ran aft below the hull to a twin-bladed screw, first of 11.75 inches diameter and later, in trials, of 9 inches.|$|R
5000|$|The 2005 Jeep Hurricane concept had an {{all-wheel drive}} layout that {{featured}} two V8 engines powering a single driveshaft, with a <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> in {{the centre of}} the vehicle. The gears connected to two additional driveshafts, one {{on each side of the}} vehicle, that delivered power to the wheels via driveshaft joints. This was designed in order to accommodate the vehicle's unique steering system.|$|R

5000|$|The 300 {{series was}} unusual in having the <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> to the De Dion tube rear axle as a transaxle, with the 2 liter models having the {{driveshaft}} enclosed in a [...] "torque tube". The rear-mounted gearbox helped with weight distribution but {{resulted in an}} unusually large transmission tunnel, especially by comparison with then-contemporary front wheel drive competitors such as the Mk. III Ford Escort and the Opel Kadett E/Mk. II Vauxhall Astra.|$|R
5000|$|Older Kamikaze rides were {{powered by}} a [...] DC motor, coupled to a drive shaft which {{traveled}} up the tower to drive the rotating arms, but newer models are powered by the same DC motor mounted directly to a <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> {{at the top of}} the tower. This gearbox is manufactured by Brevini in Italy, with a coupling box made by PTG. The same planetary gear used can be found on a large quantity of earth movers all over Europe.|$|R
5000|$|In some modern sports cars, {{the gear}} lever has been {{replaced}} entirely by [...] "paddles", which are a pair of levers, usually operating electrical switches (rather than a mechanical connection to the <b>gearbox),</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on either side of}} the steering column, where one increments the gears up, and the other down. Formula 1 cars used to hide the gear stick behind the steering wheel within the nose bodywork before the modern practice of mounting the [...] "paddles" [...] on the (removable) steering wheel itself.|$|R
50|$|In 2006 Rydquist went to race {{in one of}} the world's most {{challenging}} races: The 24 Hours of Nurburgring Nordschleife. Rydquist and the Levin Racing team had a firm grip on their class podium until the <b>gearbox</b> <b>mount</b> of their Porsche 996 (3.5 litres) gave way {{in the middle of the}} night and was followed by an on-track incident. After repairs, the team salvaged a 9th in class finish. Rydquist also set the fastest lap of the race in the Swedish Endurance Racing series season premiere with MV Racing's Porsche 911 GT2 R.|$|R
5000|$|The {{architecture}} of the GranTurismo and GranCabrio derives from the M139 platform of the fifth generation Quattroporte, shortened about [...] cm in the wheelbase and [...] cm in the rear overhang.Like on the Quattroporte the engine is pushed back beyond the front wheel's centerline, inside the wheelbase—in the front mid-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout. This confers a 49%/51% front/rear weight distribution to automatic transmission cars. [...] "MC SportShift" [...] sequential transmission variants have a further rear-biased 47%/53% weight distribution, thanks to the <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> at the rear in block with the differential—in the transaxle layout.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "N-Type" [...] chassis was {{constructed}} from rolled steel channel; riveted and braced at appropriate points. It incorporated a sub frame {{on which the}} engine and <b>gearbox</b> were <b>mounted.</b>|$|R
5000|$|V-drive is a {{propulsion}} system for boats {{that consists of}} two drive shafts, a gearbox, and a propeller. In a [...] "V-drive" [...] boat, the engine is mounted {{in the rear of}} the boat and the front of the engine faces aft. Connected to the rear of the engine is the transmission. The first drive shaft connects the rear of the transmission to a <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> in the center of the boat. The second drive shaft extends from the gearbox to the rear and out the bottom of the boat to where a propeller is mounted.|$|R
5000|$|Gearbox: driven {{through a}} single dry plate disc clutch {{mounted on the}} engine a {{separate}} four-speeds and reverse <b>gearbox</b> was <b>mounted</b> on a very substantial cross-member and controlled by a central ball-gate gear lever.|$|R
50|$|The {{engine is}} {{connected}} to a four-speed <b>gearbox</b> with centrally <b>mounted</b> change lever.|$|R
50|$|The <b>gearbox</b> was <b>mounted</b> {{behind and}} below the engine in a {{separate}} casing, rather than sharing the engine's sump oil. This reduced noise levels caused by the Mini's transmission transfer gears and allowed better control of drivetrain shunt and vibration.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} Honda CB750 and other Japanese superbikes which had {{horizontally}} split crankcases, the Trident engine {{was essentially a}} vertically split parallel twin with a separate central chamber to accommodate the third cylinder. Whereas the Speed Twin was a traditional British twin with a 360° crankshaft, this new triple had crankpins offset 120° and so inherently had much smoother primary balance, albeit with a rocking couple. Although most British motorcycles used a wet multiplate clutch, this triple had a dry single-plate clutch in a housing between the primary chaincase and the <b>gearbox.</b> <b>Mounted</b> {{on the end of}} the gearbox mainshaft (where the clutch would be expected) was a large transmission shock-absorber.|$|R
50|$|The CA {{utilised}} {{a contemporary}} powertrain layout. This {{consisted of a}} front-mounted longitudinally-oriented internal combustion engine, and rear-wheel drive. The 3-speed <b>gearbox</b> was <b>mounted</b> immediately behind the engine, and torque was transmitted to a live rear axle via an open tubular prop shaft.|$|R
2500|$|The tall Bristol {{engine was}} mounted {{forward in the}} chassis, with drive passing along a {{propshaft}} directly under the cockpit to the four-speed <b>gearbox</b> <b>mounted</b> behind the driver. This arrangement, while requiring precise balancing of the engine-speed shaft, meant that weight distribution was as even as possible. Fuel was carried in two pannier cells behind the front wheels, in the position that Bristol road cars traditionally have battery and spare wheel compartments; their central position also resulted in minimal disturbance to the handling character of the 450, whether running on full tanks or empty. The sweet handling of the resulting car was commented on by driver Lance Macklin, when he stated that the Bristol 450 [...] "could be driven without hands".|$|R
