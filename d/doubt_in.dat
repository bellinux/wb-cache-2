The proposal was met with <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> South Australia, and it later came to nothing. On 20 October 2017 it ceased manufacturing vehicles in Australia.|$|E

On December 21, 2008, Cassini passed directly over Ontario Lacus and observed specular reflection in radar. The strength of the reflection saturated the probe's receiver, indicating that the lake level did not vary by more than 3mm (implying either that surface winds were minimal, or the lake's hydrocarbon fluid is viscous).|$|E

5|$|Asch {{found that}} some 1/4 of all {{subjects}} successfully withstands this form of social pressure, 1//20 completely succumbs, while the remainder conforms to the majority's manifestly incorrect opinion only in some experimental rounds. Asch suggested that this procedure created a <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> the participants' mind about the seemingly obvious answer. Participants reported that the correct but rejected line was almost but not quite equal to the standard line. Asch {{also found that the}} effectiveness of the group pressure increased significantly from 1 person to 3 people unanimously responding incorrectly. However, there was not much increase after that. He also found that when one confederate responded correctly, the power of the majority to influence the subject decreased substantially.|$|E

5|$|Calling a {{constitutional}} convention required {{the approval of}} a majority of voters in two successive elections or a two-thirds majority of both houses of the General Assembly. In February 1797, the General Assembly voted to put the question before the electorate in the upcoming May elections. Of the 9,814 votes cast, 5,446 favored the call and 440 opposed it, but 3,928 had not voted at all, and several counties recorded no votes on the issue either way. This cast <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> the minds of many legislators regarding the true will of the people. Opponents of the convention claimed that the abstentions should be counted as votes against the call; this position had some merit, as it was well known that many Fayette County voters had abstained as a protest against the convention. When all of the irregularities were accounted for, the General Assembly determined that the vote had fallen short of the required majority.|$|E
5|$|François de Vergy, {{a member}} of the House of Vergy, had been {{informed}} of this attack by the townspeople, and he arrived in Besançon at dawn. He asked the soldiers if they were friendly, after which the insurgents responded with violence. After several exchanges of gunfire, the battle moved to the high street where the Protestants were armed with two pieces of artillery near the Battant. Two hours after the battle moved to the high street, de Vergy led a group of monks and priests to the battle, equipped with three cannons. The first two cannons did not fire, which caused <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> the Catholic ranks, despite having over 300 men, many more than the Protestant forces. However, the third cannon fired, successfully causing panic among the Protestants. The Protestants continued their fight regardless, using cannons, firearms, and knives in an attempt to stop the Catholic forces and Claude de La Baume, their leader. The Protestant leader was severely injured and his horse was hit, causing disorder in the ranks of Huguenot troops, ultimately resulting in them attempting to retreat from the city.|$|E
5|$|In 1898, Krøyer started Chez Moi, {{a series}} of watercolours of Marie and their {{daughter}} Vibeke in the family homes in Copenhagen and Skagen in a style inspired by the Art Nouveau approach adopted by Carl Larsson whom Krøyer probably met during his time in Paris. Larsson had started painting in watercolours while {{a member of the}} Grez-sur-Loing artists' colony in France. On returning to Sweden, he had begun {{a series of}} pictures of family life with his wife and children in Sundborn in the mid-1890s, publishing it as Ett hem (A home) in 1899. Krøyer's paintings display no signs of disturbance or frustration but leave an impression of a happy family environment, no <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> accordance with Krøyer's own desires. He exhibited the three from Skagen in 1889 at Den Frie – the exhibition of the artists' association that had been formed in 1891 with Krøyer's support – under the collective title Fra mit Skagenshjem (From my Skagen Home).|$|E

5|$|In April 1966, Feynman {{delivered}} {{an address}} to the National Science Teachers Association, in which he suggested how students could be made to think like scientists, be open-minded, curious, and especially, to <b>doubt.</b> <b>In</b> the course of the lecture, he gave a definition of science, which he said came about by several stages. The evolution of intelligent life on planet Earth—creatures such as cats that play and learn from experience. The evolution of humans, who came to use language to pass knowledge from one individual to the next, so that the knowledge was not lost when an individual died. Unfortunately, incorrect knowledge could be passed down as well as correct knowledge, so another step was needed. Galileo and others started doubting the truth of what was passed down and to investigate ab initio, from experience, what the true situation was—this was science.|$|E
5|$|Martha was {{described}} as being friendly, feisty and fun loving. Martha's appearance has evolved throughout her time in the show: she was initially a tomboy who loved sport, but she later became a stylish woman. Upon her return in March 2005, Martha's storylines saw her surviving a helicopter crash, having an abortion and a miscarriage, battling alcoholism, being {{diagnosed with breast cancer}} and becoming a widow after her husband was shot. In a controversial storyline Martha worked as a pole dancer; the scenes were criticised by the broadcasting regulator for their content. Whilst playing Martha, Gordon {{was at the center of}} a number of personal scandals, which put her future in the show in <b>doubt.</b> <b>In</b> January 2010, it was announced that Gordon was leaving the show and Martha departed on 9 June 2010.|$|E
5|$|Several {{theoretical}} {{objections to}} the claims of Fermi's paper were quickly raised; in particular, the exact process that took place when an atom captured a neutron was not well understood at the time. This and Fermi's accidental discovery three months later that nuclear reactions could be induced by slow neutrons cast further <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> {{the minds of many}} scientists, notably Aristid von Grosse and Ida Noddack, that the experiment was creating element 93. While von Grosse's claim that Fermi was actually producing protactinium (element 91) was quickly tested and disproved, Noddack's proposal that the uranium had been shattered into two or more much smaller fragments was simply ignored by most because existing nuclear theory did not include a way for this to be possible. Fermi and his team maintained that they were in fact synthesizing a new element, but the issue remained unresolved for several years.|$|E

5|$|The speech bubble {{makes the}} entire canvas {{relevant}} by broadening {{the attention to}} the entire width of the painting and the curves of the bubble unite the narrative with several of the picture's other graphical elements. Lichtenstein has added color, including all of the primary colors, while transforming the original and making reference to mechanical reproduction via Ben-Day dots. Like Look Mickey, {{there is reason to}} describe this image as a self-portrait of sorts. The subject is extending a finger through a circular opening, which is a self-reference because it is representative of Lichtenstein's technique of stenciling Ben-day dots by pressing the fluid onto the painting surface through a screen with a device not too different in size and shape from a finger. An alternative self-representation is interpreted as a singular peephole that represents the monocular subject matter of Lichtenstein's training, while the entire canvas represents a <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> this training's representation of the physical body, its perception and its actual view. However, the corporeal is depicted quite adequately in the intense phallicism and the dotted coloration of the skin.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} of them, a {{somewhat}} exceptional number: William P. Halliday, Samuel B. Halliday, Edwin W. Halliday, Henry L. Halliday, and Thomas W. Halliday. Of them all, I may {{be permitted to}} say that while they all differed from each other, they all exhibited features of character and conduct {{that would have given}} them prominence anywhere in the business world. No <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> some one or two important respects, each one excelled the others. This was shown in those matters and things to which they gave their chief attention. Speaking of them and their families, so well represented here with us and elsewhere, {{it can be said that}} they have always stood for better things, not with assumption or pharisaically, but openly and firmly. They pushed their business enterprises with diligence, and had there been more of such men it would have been better for the city and for them also, I have no doubt.|$|E
5|$|As {{punishment}} {{for bringing the}} world into chaos, Ashera subsequently petrifies Tellius; only the most powerful warriors and human-laguz half-breeds survive. She decides that humankind is unworthy of survival and must be eradicated, and recruits the Begnion senate to this end. Guided by Yune through Micaiah, who sides with humanity, Ike, Micaiah, and King Tibarn of Phoenicis lead three groups in a campaign through Begnion to the Tower of Guidance (a massive structure in Begnion's capital) where Ashera lies. Micaiah and her fellow Daeins seek to use the petrification {{of the world as}} a means to destroy the blood pact without harming Daein. Each of them run into the Disciples of Order, formerly regular {{men and women who have}} been empowered by Ashera to stop the protagonists. In separate engagements they confront various senators and Izuka, who reveals that Pelleas was not Ashnard's son, but an unwitting dupe used to place Daein further under Begnion's thumb. Ike also learns that the Black Knight's true identity is that of the Begnion general Zelgius. In an encounter with Senator Lekain, Empress Sanaki asks him why she has been declared a false apostle by the senate. Lekain responds that Sanaki lacks the clairvoyance and foresight traditionally associated with the royal line of Begnion as the trait only effects the eldest child, and that her (previously unknown) older sister was killed years previously. This revelation is outwardly refuted by the Empress, but she inwardly develops a degree of <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> herself. All three armies eventual convene at the base of the Tower of Guidance. Fifteen heroes are then picked to be Yune's champions against Ashera.|$|E

5|$|Mido {{was signed}} by Tottenham on an 18-month loan deal on 28 January 2005. He scored two goals on his Tottenham debut against Portsmouth on 5 February 2005. He scored 3 goals in 11 {{appearances}} during the 2004–05 season for Tottenham. Mido announced plans in July 2005 to launch his own football academy in Egypt, which had the aim of nurturing the country's young talent. In January 2006, he expressed {{that he did not}} wish to return to Roma {{at the end of the}} 2005–06 season, but rather sign permanently with Tottenham. Tottenham manager Martin Jol said that the club were confident of signing Mido on a permanent deal due to his good performances, but later admitted Tottenham may be defeated in keeping Mido, with other clubs interested in signing him. His permanent move was further put into <b>doubt</b> <b>in</b> April 2006, after he suffered a new injury problem. He suffered abuse from a small section of the Southampton and West Ham United fans in 2005. West Ham manager Alan Pardew apologised to Mido for the abuse by the fans. He finished the 2005–06 season with 11 goals in 27 games, meaning he was Tottenham's second highest goalscorer. Tottenham confirmed in May 2006 that Mido would be returning to Roma.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} by FC Bayern Munich Ngwat-Mahop {{ended up as}} a trialist in Red Bull Salzburg. He managed to persuade FC Red Bull Salzburg's manager Giovanni Trapattoni of his football skills and he signed a two-year contract with the Austrian club. After the signing of his contract {{he was sent to}} Red Bull Salzburg Juniors to get playing time. There he made his debut in a 5–1 away defeat by FK Austria Wien II. In his second match with Red Bull Salzburg Juniors he handed two assists, to his teammates Vujic and Kitzbichler, to help them score the first and second goal of their team in a 2–2 home draw with SC-ESV Parndorf. He scored his first goal for his team in an 1–3 away win against DSV Leoben in the 70th minute after an assist by Öbster. In his next match Ngwat-Mahop scored once, in a 2–1 home win against Austria Lustenau. On 26 October, he netted a goal in the 80th minute of a 2–0 home win against Bad Aussee, to put the game beyond any <b>doubt.</b> <b>In</b> the next match against SK Schwadorf he proved himself a prolific forward by scoring the opening goal of the match, in the first minute, and serving the second to his teammate David Witteveen. Red Bull Salzburg Juniors finally lost the game by a 3–2 scoreline. Ngwat-Mahop continued scoring for his team in 2–1 home win against FK Austria Wien II, by scoring the opening goal of the match. Ngwat-Mahop featured in 13 matches and scored five goals for Red Bull Salzburg Juniors until the winter break. That resulted in him being called to play with FC Red Bull Salzburg's first team. After playing in some friendly matches with Red Bull Salzburg during the winter break, he made his league debut for the club on 23 February 2008, in a 3–1 away defeat from Austria Wien, as he replaced Alexander Zickler in the 52nd minute. Ngwat-Mahop continued to feature regularly in Red Bull Salzburg's playing squad {{until the end of the}} season, although mostly as a substitute. He also managed to score his first goal with Red Bull Salzburg in a 3–0 home win against Sturm Graz. At the end of the season he totalled one goal in 12 appearances. In April 2008, Ngwat-Mahop signed a contract extension with Red Bull Salzburg until the summer of 2011.|$|E
