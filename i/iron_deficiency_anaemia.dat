5|$|Anaemia {{is a major}} {{global health}} problem for women. Women are {{affected}} more than men, in which up to 30% of women being found to be anaemic and 42% of pregnant women. Anaemia is linked {{to a number of}} adverse health outcomes including a poor pregnancy outcome and impaired cognitive function (decreased concentration and attention). The main cause of anaemia is iron deficiency. In United States women <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anaemia</b> (IDA) affects 37% of pregnant women, but globally the prevalence is as high as 80%. IDA starts in adolescence, from excess menstrual blood loss, compounded by the increased demand for iron in growth and suboptimal dietary intake. In the adult woman, pregnancy leads to further iron depletion.|$|E
5|$|Childhood {{mortality}} {{was high}} in Medieval Scotland. Children were often baptised rapidly, by laymen and occasionally by midwives, {{because of the}} belief that unbaptised children would be dammed. It was more normally undertaken in a church and was a means of creating wider spiritual kinship with godparents. Cemeteries may not represent {{a cross section of}} Medieval society, but in one Aberdeen cemetery 53 per cent of those buried were under the age of six and in one Linlithgow cemetery it was 58 per cent. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> <b>anaemia</b> seems to have been common among children, probably caused by long-term breastfeeding by mothers that were themselves deficient in minerals. Common childhood diseases included measles, diphtheria and whooping-cough, while parasites were also common. In Lowland noble and wealthy society by the fifteenth century the practice of wet-nursing had become common. In Highland society there was a system of fosterage among clan leaders, where boys and girls would leave their parent's house to be brought up in that of other chiefs, creating a fictive bond of kinship that helped cement alliances and mutual bonds of obligation. The majority of children, even in urban centres where opportunities for formal education were greatest, did not attend school. In the families of craftsmen children probably carried out simpler tasks. They might later become apprentices or journeymen. In Lowland rural society, as in England, many young people, both male and female, probably left home to become domestic and agricultural servants, as they can be seen doing in large numbers from the sixteenth century. By the late Medieval era, Lowland society was probably part of the north-west European marriage model, of life-cycle service and late marriage, usually in the mid-20s, delayed by the need to acquire the resources to be able to form a household.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Hepcidin is {{the main}} hormone that regulates iron balance. Its {{lowering}} favours digestive iron absorption in cases of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> or enhanced erythropoiesis. The careful dosage of this small peptide promises new diagnostic and therapeutic strategies. Its measurement is progressively being validated and now its clinical value must be explored in different physiological situations. Here, we evaluate hepcidin levels among premenopausal female donors with <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> without <b>anaemia.</b> MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a preceding study, a 4 -week oral iron treatment (80 mg/day) was administered in a randomized controlled trial (n = 145), in cases of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> without <b>anaemia</b> after a blood donation. We subsequently measured hepcidin at baseline and after 4 weeks of treatment, using mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Iron supplementation {{had a significant effect}} on plasma hepcidin compared to the placebo arm at 4 weeks [+ 0 · 29 nm [95 % CI: 0 · 18 to 0 · 40]). There was a significant correlation between hepcidin and ferritin at baseline (R(2) = 0 · 121, P < 0 · 001) and after treatment (R(2) = 0 · 436, P < 0 · 001). Hepcidin levels at baseline were not predictive of concentration changes for ferritin or haemoglobin. However, hepcidin levels at 4 weeks were significantly higher (0 · 79 nm [95 % CI: 0 · 53 to 1 · 05]) among ferritin responders. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a 4 -week oral treatment of iron increased hepcidin blood concentrations in female blood donors with an initial ferritin concentration of less than 30 ng/ml. Apparently, hepcidin cannot serve as a predictor of response to iron treatment but might serve as a marker of the iron repletion needed for erythropoiesis...|$|R
40|$|The role of {{intestinal}} nematode {{infections in}} the aetiology of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>anaemia</b> in pregnant women {{was investigated in}} peri-urban and rural areas of Western Sierra Leone. A randomised placebo-controlled field trial was carried out to evaluate the efficacy of a single course of albendazole (400 mg) and daily iron-folate supplements (36 g iron and 5 mg folate), administered after the first trimester, as control interventions for intestinal nematode infections and anaemia during pregnancy. At baseline, in the first trimester of pregnancy, the prevalence (and geometric mean intensity) of intestinal nematodes was as follows: Ascaris lumbricoides 21. 1 % (267 eggs per gram); Necator americanus 66. 5 % (191 epg); and Trichuris trichiura 71. 9 % (93 epg). Chronic undernutrition (height g/l) in 21. 2 % of women. <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> {{is likely to have}} a dietary basis in these women. The dietary iron intake was predominantly non-haem, and was estimated to supply less than 1 g of absorbable iron daily. High fertility and closely spaced pregnancies placed additional stress on iron stores. The findings {{of this study indicate that}} anthelminthic treatment should be included in strategies to control maternal anaemia in Western Sierra Leone. It is recommended that pregnant women routinely receive a single course of anthelminthics after the first trimester, alongside daily iron-folate supplements, to minimise the decline in maternal Hb concentration during pregnancy. These interventions could be implemented through the existing primary health care system, although the use of traditional birth attendants should be investigated as a means of improving compliance and coverage. The implications of these findings for public health policy in other antenatal populations will depend on the local epidemiology of intestinal nematode infections and on the extent of underlying maternal <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>anaemia...</b>|$|R

Design and setting: A cross-sectional survey conducted in 1992, examining faecal specimens and blood samples from Aboriginals and non-Aboriginals in a remote coastal community in the north of Western Australia. Participants: All those living in the community {{at the time of the}} survey. Main outcome measures: Parasite status and haematological values for haemoglobin, serum iron, ferritin, transferrin and mean red cell volume. Results: Infections with hookworm were present throughout the Aboriginal population (77 %; n = 243), with the highest prevalence in children aged 5 - 14 years (93 %; n = 74). Hookworm was not detected in non-Aboriginals (n = 24). <b>Iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> was common throughout the Aboriginal population, especially in children aged 5 - 14 years (79 %; n = 68) and women aged over 14 years (72 %; n = 65). Anaemia was highly prevalent among Aboriginal children aged 5 - 14 years (84 % in hookworm-positive children, 75 % in hookworm-negative) and women aged over 14 years (63 % in hookworm-positive women, 31 % in hookworm-negative). Aboriginals over 14 years of age who had hookworm (n = 82) had significantly lower levels of haemoglobin, serum iron and serum ferritin, a lower mean red cell volume and significantly higher transferrin levels than uninfected Aboriginals (n = 38) and non-Aboriginals (n = 19) in the same age group.

40|$|Maintaining a {{positive}} iron balance {{is essential for}} female athletes to avoid the effects of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency</b> and <b>anaemia</b> and to maintain or improve performance. A major function of iron is {{in the production of}} the oxygen and carbon dioxide carrying molecule, haemoglobin via erythropoiesis. Iron balance is under the control of a number of factors including the peptide hormone hepcidin, dietary iron intake and absorption, environmental stressors (e. g. altitude), exercise, menstrual blood loss and genetics. Menstruating females, particularly those with heavy menstrual bleeding are at an elevated risk of <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency.</b> Haemoglobin concentration [Hb] and serum ferritin (sFer) are traditionally used to identify <b>iron</b> <b>deficiency,</b> however, in isolation these may have limited value in athletes due to: 1. the effects of fluctuations in plasma volume in response to training or the environment on [Hb], 2. the influence of inflammation on sFer and 3. the absence of sport, gender and individually specific normative data.

Analysis was by intention to treat and consistency of use. The primary outcomes were change in haemoglobin and iron status. FINDINGS The study population comprised 164 participants eating from aluminium cooking pots and 158 from iron cooking pots. The mean haemoglobin change was significantly increased after 6 weeks in adults who consistently ate from an iron cooking pot (+ 3. 6 g/l compared to - 3. 2 g/l, mean difference between groups 6. 8 g/l, 95 % CI + 0. 86, + 12. 74).
