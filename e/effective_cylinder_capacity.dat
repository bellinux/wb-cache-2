5000|$|There {{have been}} two schools of thought {{about the origin of}} the [...] "Am" [...] moniker, one {{explaining}} Am as standing for [...] "Alleggerita maggiorata" [...] (Italian: lightened enlarged, referring to the lightened body and enlarged <b>cylinder</b> <b>capacity)</b> and the other as standing for [...] "America".

40|$|The {{analysis}} of Technical Note 2250, 1950, is extended {{to include the}} effects of flow rotation. It is found that the theoretical pressure distributions over drive cylinders can be related by the hypersonic similarity rule with sufficient accuracy for most engineering purposes.

40|$|Many {{analytical}} results {{have already been}} reported on the imbalanced exciting moment of V-type multi-cylinder engine. These analytical methods generally follow the steps in which the cylinder arrangement and the bank angle of the engine are determined initially and then the exciting moments are analyzed. In contrast, in our analytical method, <b>effective</b> <b>cylinder</b> arrangements are selected initially using the reduction condition of exciting moment, and then the most suitable bank angle is determined. We have already determined new bank angles of V-type 6 -cylinder and 8 -cylinder engines using the method mentioned above. In this paper, we study the exciting moment of a V-type 10 -cylinder engine that was developed by an American automobile company. We have not determined a way to completely suppress the imbalanced moment of the engine, but we found new bank angles of the practical engine. In this report, we show the method for calculating the <b>effective</b> <b>cylinder</b> arrangements and the bank angle of a V- 10 engine...|$|R

50|$|The Peugeot Type 176 {{was a top}} of {{the range}} car {{produced}} from 1925 to 1928 by the French auto manufacturer Peugeot.

5|$|The {{nominal volume}} of gas stored is {{commonly}} quoted as the <b>cylinder</b> <b>capacity</b> in the USA. It {{is a measure}} of the volume of gas that can be released from the full cylinder at atmospheric pressure. Terms used for the capacity include 'free gas volume' or 'free gas equivalent'. It depends on the internal volume and the working pressure of a cylinder. If the working pressure is higher, the cylinder will store more gas for the same volume.|$|R
50|$|The C-45 had a one-cylinder, {{two-stroke}} engine, with {{a maximum}} power of 33 kW (45 hp) and a <b>cylinder</b> <b>capacity</b> of 10,300 cc. The gearbox was 3-speed and the cylinder was placed horizontally. To start the engine, it was first heated by a blow lamp. Then, the steering wheel was removed, along with the column, and slid {{into one of the}} flywheels. By then turning the steering wheel, the engine was started. This process required physical strength and skill.|$|R
