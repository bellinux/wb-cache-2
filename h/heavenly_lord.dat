The Abbot therefore took courage, and admitted them into the hospice, with solemn warnings as to the doom which they might expect if they took the value of a horse-nail from the patrimony of the blessed saint. Was he less powerful or less careful of his own honor than St. Lieven of Holthem, who, not more than fifty years before, had struck stone-blind four soldiers of the Emperor Henry's, who had dared, after warning, to plunder the altar? [Footnote: Ibid.] Let them remember, too, the fate of their own forefathers, the heathens of the North, and the check which, one hundred and seventy years before, they had received under those very walls. They had exterminated the people of Walcheren; they had taken prisoner Count Regnier; they had burnt Ghent, Bruges, and St. Omer itself, close by; they had left naught between the Scheldt and the Somme, save stark corpses and blackened ruins.

5000|$|The Wanderer {{conveys the}} meditations of a solitary exile on his past {{happiness}} {{as a member}} of his lord's band of retainers, his present hardships and the values of forbearance and faith in the <b>heavenly</b> <b>Lord.</b> The warrior is identified as eardstapa (line 6a), usually translated as [...] "wanderer" [...] (from eard meaning 'earth' or 'land', and steppan, meaning 'to step'), who roams the cold seas and walks [...] "paths of exile" [...] (wr√¶clastas).

Yet fate (wyrd) turned against him when he lost his lord, kinsmen and comrades in battle‚Äîthey were defending their homeland against an attack‚Äîand he was driven into exile. Some readings of the poem see the wanderer as progressing through three phases; first as the anhoga (solitary man) who dwells on the deaths of other warriors and the funeral of his lord, then as the modcearig man (man troubled in mind) who meditates on past hardships and on the fact that mass killings have been innumerable in history, and finally as the snottor on mode (man wise in mind) who has come to understand that life is full of hardships, impermanence, and suffering, and that stability only resides with God. Other readings accept the general statement that the exile does come to understand human history, his own included, in philosophical terms, but would point out that the poem has elements in common with [...] "The Battle of Maldon", a poem about a battle in which an Anglo-Saxon troop was defeated by Viking invaders.|$|E

40|$|English Capstone 4995 : Senior Honors Thesis, [...] . Friday, May 8, 2015. "Over {{the turn}} of the centuries, chivalry has evolved and {{acquired}} numerous definitions. Currently the characteristics of a chivalric knight are skewed by the gentlemanly mannerisms and jousting tournaments seen in films. However in the First Crusade, a knight‚Äôs actions were determined by his prowess in battle and devotion to his earthly and <b>heavenly</b> <b>lord.</b> There is plenty of evidence that refutes crusaders‚Äô chivalric nature and argues that they were nothing more than greedy warmongers. Nevertheless, the chivalric nature of the crusaders cannot be analyzed from a modern point of view. If the texts are viewed through the eyes of their authors, then it is clear that based on the evidence presented the knights are shown to be following the ideals of chivalry at that time. The historical and literary texts analyzed in this thesis provide first hand knowledge of the events pertaining to the First Crusade. Although there is always biases that surface, for the most part many of the works provide an accurate representation of the crusaders. The evidence provided shows that any knight wishing to create a reputation for himself would set out for Jerusalem, fight valiantly in battle, and take home the spoils of war with a reputation for chivalry. The study of several literary and historical sources as well as the contextual meaning of chivalry and crusading reveals that while many believed chivalry was a force for good, there are those who believe chivalric knights used the crusades as an excuse gain wealth and power. Regardless of how the evidence is interpreted by modern standards, the authors of the primary texts depict the crusading knights possessing the characteristics of chivalry as defined by that time period.

40|$|The {{works of}} the Gawain-poet have been {{examined}} for traces of French influence, of Celtic influence, and of Latin influence; {{they have not been}} systematically examined for that influence which was closer to home for the poet, Anglo-Saxon influence. Yet the poet's word choice and diction indicate a pervasive Anglo-Saxon influence, possibly reflecting the poet's knowledge of the language of the past, or possibly reflecting an extensive vocabulary in the vernacular which was heavily rooted in the Anglo-Saxon but which has not been preserved in manuscript. In Cleanness, the poet uses concepts which indicate his familiarity with an Anglo-Saxon biblical tradition. In Patience, Pearl, and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, the poet's word choice indicates a closer lexical indebtedness to the Anglo-Saxon parent language than has been heretofore examined. The poet does use words which are a traditional part of the "word-hoard" available to the alliterative poet. He also uses, however, words which are unique to him or words which appear {{for the first time in}} Middle English in this manuscript. Several of these words have homophones in Anglo-Saxon which point to possible double meanings not previously recognized. The poet's Anglo-Saxon word choice lends a coloring of the comitatus to his works. Noah, Abraham, and Lot can be viewed as ideal thegns, whereas Jonah can be viewed as a failed thegn. The Pearl-maiden can be viewed as a peace-weaver, mediating between her former earthly lord and her new <b>heavenly</b> <b>Lord.</b> The poet's word choice lends to Sir Gawain and the Green Knight faint epic tones reminiscent of the Anglo-Saxon epic, Beowulf. An Anglo-Saxon dimension is just one more of the many dimensions to be examined in this extremely complex poetry. The poet's Northwest Midland dialect, relatively unadulterated by contact with the court of William the Conqueror, is closer to the Northumbrian ancestor dialect than other regions which had been heavily influenced by the French, so this Anglo-Saxon dimension should not be ignored...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 1997 Nineteenth-century China was {{an ideological}} volcano, with rebellions erupting {{throughout}} the century. But only one, the Taiping Rebellion, transformed the social landscape. There is, nevertheless, something puzzling about the Taiping impact. As broad and as devastating as the impact was, the Taiping movement, {{apart from the}} Ch'ing efforts to suppress it, seems to have resulted in no long-term transformation of Chinese society. Most scholars have sought to explain this conundrum by arguing {{that it was the}} alien quality of the Taiping faith which explains why the Taiping were prevented from sparking any long-term transformation of Chinese society. This has solved one riddle, but created another: How then, if their ideology was so alien, were the Taiping able to recruit the legions of people to their cause and to mount their large-scale rebellion in the first place?I argue in my dissertation that the Taiping's Christian sectarianism, while unique in Chinese history, was more connected to culture and society than scholars have recognized. Indeed, the reason for the singularly unique impact of the Taiping movement relates both to the original character of Taiping ideology and to its creative connectedness to Chinese society. My argument is composed of three parts: {{in the first part of}} my study, I examine the translation of Catholic Christianity into the <b>Heavenly</b> <b>Lord</b> sect; in the second part, I look at the content and practice of Taiping Christian sectarianism; and in the third part, I survey the contact which the Taiping initiated with the sects and secret societies. How the Taiping rebels interpreted the divine pretensions of the emperor and what they understood as the blasphemous character of the imperial office were both directly tied to their faith in Shang-ti. This faith ultimately led them on their iconoclastic campaigns whose impact on Chinese society contributed to the transformation of popular society, winning for the rebels a legacy in Chinese history...|$|E
40|$|Translation begins] Hotel Albert Selma, Ala., March 15, 1945 My darling husband, One day {{has gone}} by {{and it was}} a day wasted. Any day that I don‚Äôt see you is. Just woke up a few seconds ago, sweetheart. It was awful to sleep along without you, honey. One good thing was that I was so tired hat I went right to sleep + slept until around nine almost without waking up. Gee, darling, {{marriage}} sure {{can make a difference in}} a person‚Äôs life. I feel so sorry for all my friends who aren‚Äôt‚Äô married. The poor girls- oh, well, they don‚Äôt know what they‚Äôre missing so that probably is all right. Everyone was so right who told me about you‚Äôll wonder how you ever lived before without it. It seems as though we‚Äôd always been married. It really amazes me now more than ever how girls can marry someone they don‚Äôt really love. Julie + I were talking about that last night. If I wasn‚Äôt madly in love with you it would make me hate you more to even touch me. I just can‚Äôt see how they ever could. Marriage is the most wonderful think in the world when you‚Äôre in love. And I sure am in love with you. Being away from you is so awful. Part of me just isn‚Äôt- (this is the worst pen). Golly, darling, I hope the 31 st hurries and gets here. Golly, what a marriage. We‚Äôve only been married less than a week and you‚Äôre miles away. They can‚Äôt do that to us. How do you like the field down there. It‚Äôs supposed to be awful from what I‚Äôve heard. How do you like air gunnery. I suppose you do a lot. It‚Äôs miserable day today. Looks like it‚Äôs going to rain any minute. I‚Äôm so glad that we had such a beautiful day for you graduation + wedding. I wish that you had married me before you graduated- at Christmas. But I suppose it would have been awful because you never got open Post. It seems so long ago- Christmas I mean. Years and years- and it seems like eight million years since we were together. Gee, honey, I hope you‚Äôre at this post a good long time. Don‚Äôt get angry. I know you don‚Äôt but I like it here. Everyone has been so nice and besides the longer you‚Äôre here, the longer we can be together. Last night I slept in the top to your pajamas- slightly large but it was comfortable. Besides you wore them and it made me not so lonesome. I really should get up + get ready to go to Mrs. Moseley‚Äôs. I would rather write to you though. How I‚Äôll ever get there with all this extra stuff will be a problem. My suitcases are packed real full and there‚Äôs still all the clothes in the closet to go. Oh, honey, I love you so. Being married to you is the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. You‚Äôre so sweet and understanding and thoughtful and the most wonderful husband in the world. Lord, I‚Äôm lucky. Today I‚Äôll be real good + write to mom. I just was too beat last night and too busy all day. I wish that the 31 st would hurry- Golly after we were married I never thought I‚Äôd be anxious for the days to hurry. After the 31 st though when we‚Äôre together again I hope they go so nice and slowly. Julie‚Äôs going to try to get some film for me but it won‚Äôt do much good until you fix the camera. She said she knew an officer who wanted to sell a car but can‚Äôt remember who it was. Maybe we can buy one. Julie wants me to go out to the Post + get my pass. I‚Äôm sorta afraid to go when you‚Äôre not here. It wouldn‚Äôt see right but I would like to see the bulletin board + try to get a house- I mean a room. Well, darling, I‚Äôd better get a bath + start packing- I love you so, honey. I miss you terribly. I love you more than I ever thought possible. Well, darling, here I am at Mrs. Moseley‚Äôs. It‚Äôs a nice clean place but holy cow if you breathe around here, it sounds like an A 9 - 6 taking off. Everyone is so darned quiet. We‚Äôd never be able to stay here. They‚Äôd probably throw us out at the first night. Well, I‚Äôll look for a room tomorrow. I have to stay here a week + maybe at the end of that time something will turn up. It‚Äôs raining now I think. Golly, honey, I miss you so. Every time I say my husband- it sounds so nice. I wish you were here with me now. It‚Äôs thundering and we could be so comfortable here. The bed doesn‚Äôt squeak by the way. I hope that I can find someplace to live before this week is up because you‚Äôd go crazy here. We‚Äôd undoubtedly be requested to leave the way we carry on. Lord, in the middle of the night we get the maddest ideas- remember? Gee, honey, I wish I could tell you how very much I love you. It is so lonesome without you, honey- life just isn‚Äôt the same for me. These seventeen days shouldn‚Äôt take too long but I know every minute will seem like a thousand years. I love you so, Judd. I‚Äôm so happy honey, of course not as happy as I‚Äôd be if you were here- but you know what I mean. Everyone at the hotel is trying to find us a room, honey. I sure hope I can find one near to town for when you come back. Julie + Betty Jo + I will probably go to the movies tonight. Julie is so nice to me. She wouldn‚Äôt let me be alone at all. Afraid I‚Äôll get lonesome but she‚Äôs no consolation. You‚Äôre all I need, baby + you‚Äôre all I‚Äôll ever need. Without you my life just wouldn‚Äôt be anything. I couldn‚Äôt live without you, honey. What a difference marriage can make. I never thought I would ever be dependent upon one man for my happiness. It sure changes everything. Golly, I love you. Every minute we‚Äôre together makes me love you more + more. My husband- that sure sounds wonderful and you sure are- Golly, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so happy. You‚Äôre so wonderful, honey and I‚Äôm so proud to be your wife. I hope that one morning soon we‚Äôll be able to lie in bed together + not have to get up a four or five so that I can just sit and look at you. You look so adorable when you‚Äôre asleep. I hope that you‚Äôre not working too hard + that the weather is nice down there. It would be horrible if it wasn‚Äôt and they made you stay down longer- what an awful thought. Do you miss me, honey? Golly, I miss you. Millions more than I ever did before. If these seventeen days don‚Äôt hurry I‚Äôll be so lonesome that it will be almost dangerous for you to get back. I wish we could find a handcuff or something so that they could never make us apart. We just shouldn‚Äôt be separated darling. It‚Äôs funny, darling, ever since I first met you I‚Äôve had that we were meant for each other feeling. As we sure were. Honey, would you mind awfully if something happened- that sounds queer but I mean if I did have a baby. I know that you‚Äôd hate to be tied down. If we were going to have one maybe it would be better if I didn‚Äôt tell you about it. I wouldn‚Äôt want you to worry or be unhappy. You know how I feel about it, honey, in case- But you know how I feel. I love you so, my darling. Being away from you is just like living in a sorta semi-existence. Life won‚Äôt be the same until you and I are together again. Then everything will be perfect + I‚Äôll be so happy. Darling, I‚Äôll never be able to tell you how much I love you or show you. I‚Äôll be trying to for the rest of our lives but it just can‚Äôt be done. Besides, my love for you keeps growing stronger every day. I was sure before we were married- when everyone said you‚Äôll love each other more after you‚Äôre married that I couldn‚Äôt possible love you any more, but I do and every day I love you more. Honey, I‚Äôll be so happy when we‚Äôre together again. Just walking down the street with you will be wonderful and being in your arms again will be heaven. Honey, I wish I could write the way I feel but I just can‚Äôt express it. You always say the sweetest things, Judd. I love you so. Golly, it‚Äôs pouring! Have to get some more ink- just a sec Oh, honey, I must remember to write to the paper. I can‚Äôt do anything- I‚Äôm much too much in love. That‚Äôs the understatement of the year. Golly, darling, you sure have changed me. How I love it, too. Julie is wrapping Tom‚Äôs glasses that he left at her house and we‚Äôll probably mail them tonight + you can give them to Tom. I should go into town now + get some of the things that I‚Äôve forgotten to. I can‚Äôt find my tooth brush. You must have it, honey. Do you? I‚Äôll get one tonight anyway. Honey, I hope I‚Äôll be a good wife. I can‚Äôt do a thing a wife is supposed to- can‚Äôt cook + don‚Äôt like to- can‚Äôt keep house + have no ambition to- can‚Äôt do much of anything but love you. That‚Äôs the only thing I like to do, too. I guess I‚Äôll just have to devote all my time + energy to that. What a wonderful job. I have your pictures by my bed darling so that when I wake up every morning that‚Äôs the first thing I see. Honey, it sure was fate that brought us together. I‚Äôm so lucky darling to have you for my husband. I‚Äôll be thankful for you for always. I can‚Äôt imagine what I ever would have done without you.

By the way, have you gotten any for me? Gee, Judd, I never dreamed I could be so completely in love with anyone. I was in love with you before we married but it was nothing compared to this. Every minute we‚Äôre together is wonderful. I‚Äôll be so glad when we are together again. What a thing for the Army to do. Here we‚Äôve practically just been married and what do they do- separate us. At a time like this, too. I tried to write a letter to mom + my mother but I just can‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just as thought they were here when we were together. I can‚Äòt write to anyone but you. Told mom that you were going to air gunnery school. It‚Äôs awful, Judd. I could write to you all night but a page is the most I can write anyone else. Gee, honey, I‚Äôll sure be glad when you‚Äôre back here again. Without you I‚Äôm completely lost. Like a fish out of water only worse. Golly, I love you so. I‚Äôll be so happy to be with you again, honey. It‚Äôs going to be wonderful. That‚Äôs all I can think about- you. My darling, I miss you so. Golly, honey, you can‚Äôt imagine how much. Well sweetheart, I guess I‚Äôd better start going into Selma before all the stores close. Oh, I can eat now it‚Äôs amazing. Please try to write often darling, a letter from you would mean so much. I hope you don‚Äôt mind if I sleep in the tops of your pajamas but it makes me feel closer to you + not quite so lonesome. I love you so, darling. I‚Äôll mail this now + will probably write when I get back from the movies. How long does it take for you to get my mail? I love you so honey. I miss you so much, darling. Til we‚Äôre together again. My darling, I love you + I‚Äôm always Yours, Dottie [Translation ends...|$|E
50|$|Swami Haridas was the reincarnation of Lalita ‚Äòsakhi‚Äô (female friend), of {{the inner}} {{consortium}} of Lord Krishna. This easily explains {{the fact that even}} in his childhood, he was more into meditation and scriptures, while other children of his age were busy playing. He was married at the suitable age according to the time to Harimati. Even after his marriage, young Haridas stayed away from worldly pleasures and concentrated on meditation. Harimatiji was such a saintly soul herself that on realizing the inclination of her husband, she prayed intensely and was bodily transported to the <b>heavenly</b> abode of <b>Lord</b> by entering the flame of a small lamp in the presence of Haridas. No physical remains were left behind.|$|R

But then being sent back by Rama to his [...] "dead" [...] body to fulfill his desire to help many people, whose faces were shown to him from that subtle dimension beyond our Earthly [...] "reality".

60|$|There is, [Greek: h√¥s √©moige dokei], one flaw in Baxter's {{plea for}} his Presbyterian form of Church government, {{that he uses}} a metaphor, which, inasmuch as it is but a metaphor, agrees with the thing meant in some points only, {{as if it were}} {{commensurate}} 'in toto', and virtually identical. Thus, the Presbyter is a shepherd as far as the watchfulness, tenderness, and care, are to be the same in both; but it does not follow that the Presbyter has the same sole power and exclusive right of guidance; and for this reason,--that his flock are not sheep, but men; not of a natural, generic, or even constant inferiority of judgment; but Christians, co-heirs of the promises, and therein of the gifts of the Holy Spirit, and of the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures. How then can they be excluded from a share in Church Government? The words of Christ, if they may be transferred from their immediate application to the Jewish Synagogue, suppose the contrary;--and that highest act of government, the election of the officers and ministers of the Church, was confessedly exercised by the congregations including the Presbyters and Arch-presbyter or Bishop, in the primitive Church. The question, therefore, is:--Is a national Church, established by law, compatible with Christianity? If so, as Baxter held, the representatives (King, Lords, and Commons,) are or may be representatives of the whole people as Christians as well as civil subjects;--and their voice will then be the voice of the Church, which every individual, as an individual, themselves as individuals, and, 'a fortiori', the officers and administrators appointed by them, are bound to obey at the risk of excommunication, against which there would be no appeal, but to the <b>heavenly</b> C√¶sar, the <b>Lord</b> and Head of the universal Church. But whether as the accredited representatives and plenipotentiaries of the national Church, they can avail themselves of their conjoint but distinct character, as temporal legislators, to superadd corporal or civil penalties to the spiritual sentence in points peculiar to Christianity, as heretical opinions, Church ceremonies, and the like, thus destroying 'discipline', even as wood is destroyed by combination with fire;--this is a new and difficult question, which yet Baxter and the Presbyterian divines, and the Puritans of that age in general, not only answered affirmatively, but most zealously, not to say furiously, affirmed with anathemas to the assertors of the negative, and spiritual threats to the magistrates neglecting to interpose the temporal sword. In this respect the present Dissenters have the advantage over their earlier predecessors; {{but on the other hand}} they utterly evacuate the Scriptural commands against schism; take away all sense and significance from the article respecting the Catholic Church; and in consequence degrade the discipline itself into mere club-regulations or the by-laws of different lodges;--that very discipline, the capability of exercising which in its own specific nature without superinduction of a destructive and transmutual opposite, is the fairest and firmest support of their cause.|$|R
