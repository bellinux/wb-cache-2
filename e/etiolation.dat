50|$|Belgian endive {{is known}} in Dutch as witloof or witlof ("white leaf"), endive or (very rarely) witloof in the United States, indivia in Italy, endivias in Spain, chicory in the UK, as witlof in Australia, endive in France, and chicon in parts of {{northern}} France, in Wallonia and (in French) in Luxembourg. It has a small head of cream-coloured, bitter leaves. It is grown completely underground or indoors {{in the absence of}} sunlight to prevent the leaves from turning green and opening up (<b>etiolation).</b> The plant has to be kept just below the soil surface as it grows, only showing the very tip of the leaves. It is often sold wrapped in blue paper to protect it from light, so to preserve its pale colour and delicate flavour. The smooth, creamy white leaves may be served stuffed, baked, boiled, cut and cooked in a milk sauce, or simply cut raw. The tender leaves are slightly bitter; the whiter the leaf, the less bitter the taste. The harder inner part of the stem {{at the bottom of the}} head can be cut out before cooking to prevent bitterness. Belgium exports chicon/witloof to over 40 different countries.

40|$|Avocado (Persea americana) {{contributes}} $ 180 {{million at}} the farm gate and $ 420 million at retail to the Australian economy. Avocado is a woody tree species that is commercially grafted to obtain both desirable fruiting and rootstock resilience qualities. Clonal rootstocks derived from cuttings yield three times higher than sexually reproduced. However, the difficulty to generate adventitious roots on avocado stem cuttings makes propagation of rootstocks a significant challenge. The Frolich and Platt double grafting protocol is the standard practice for rootstock propagation and involves an un-interrupted <b>etiolation</b> step crucial for rooting. However, the molecular basis for this <b>etiolation</b> requirement is not yet understood. To address this, we analysed the effect of <b>etiolation</b> on expression of root promoting miR 160 and the root inhibitor miR 167 in avocado stems grafted for rootstock clonal propagation. Whilst miR 167 expression was not strongly correlated to <b>etiolation</b> treatments, <b>etiolation</b> resulted in a distinct spatial regulation of miR 160, with significantly stronger expression in basal tissue than in apical tissue, correlating {{to the site of}} adventitious root production. This is a trend absent in non-etiolated plants.

Expression of strigolactone biosynthesis and signaling related genes indicated that promotion by <b>etiolation</b> may be related to enhanced polar auxin transport. Increased rooting after flooding may have been brought about by accumulation of ethylene in the cutting (ethylene has been reported to increase sensitivity to auxin) and by massive formation of secondary phloem (the tissue close to which adventitious roots are induced).

The approach consisted of exposing plant material to potential growth-regulating treatments, selecting the more promising ones and excising the shoot-tips from associated plantlets to evaluate treatment effects on virus eradication. Treatments consisted of dark-induced <b>etiolation</b> and growth regulators believed to have antiviral activity. Sprouts attached to seed pieces responded to the growth-promoting effect of GA₃. However, the presence of decay microorganisms made this approach unsuitable. Nodal cuttings from isolated disinfected sprouts or from plantlets grown under aseptic conditions in vitro produced more suitable plant material since growth of decay microorganisms was minimal. Nodal cuttings from plantlets developed in vitro responded more obviously to growthregulating treatments than those from sprouts.

40|$|Considering {{the known}} effects of xyloglucan endotransglycosylase (XET) on plant growth and development, we aimed to {{determine}} whether XETs help to regulate the growth and elongation of Huangguogan shoots and roots. We confirmed a possible role for XET during seedling <b>etiolation.</b> Our results revealed that the roots of etiolated seedlings (H-E) were longer than those of green seedlings (H-G). However, shoot length exhibited the opposite pattern. We also observed positive and negative effects on the xyloglucan-degrading activity of XET in the root sub-apical region and shoots of etiolated Huangguogan seedling, respectively. There was a significant down-regulation in CitXET expression in the etiolated shoots at 15 days after seed germination. On the contrary, it was significantly increased in the root sub-apical region of etiolated and multicolored seedlings at 15 days after seed germination. The XET coding sequence (i. e., CitXET) was cloned from Huangguogan seedlings using gene-specific primers. The encoded amino acid sequence was predicted by using bioinformatics-based methods. The 990 -bp CitXET gene was highly homologous to other XET genes. The CitXET protein was predicted to contain 319 amino acids, with a molecular mass of 37. 45 kDa and an isoelectric point of 9. 05. The predicted molecular formula was C 1724 H 2548 N 448 O 466 S 14, and the resulting protein included only one transmembrane structure. The CitXET secondary structure consisted of four main structures (i. e., 21 % α-helix, 30. 72 % extended strand, 9. 09 % β-turn, and 39. 18 % random coil).

40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{economic}} potential of the sheanut tree (Vitellaria paradoxa), its domestication still has not been achieved due to the long juvenile period of seed propagated plants {{and the absence of}} a reliable vegetative propagation method. Three experiments were conducted by using a modified container layering technique to investigate the effects of season (rainy and dry season), light treatments (<b>etiolation</b> and natural light) and indole 3 -butyric acid (IBA) on root formation in juvenile and mature sheanut trees. The effect of light treatments on the internal conditions such as level of sugars (soluble, insoluble and total sugars) and total free phenols in layered sheanut shoots w as also considered. Rooting was generally lower in the mature trees (27. 9 %) compared to that in juvenile 4 year-old plants (40. 9 %). <b>Etiolation</b> increased the levels of total sugars and phenols in shoots of 4 - year-old plants and mature fruit bearing trees, but this increase did not significantly enhance rooting in both the juvenile and mature sheanut trees. The container layering technique holds promise as a method for the asexual propagation of sheanut planting material. Roots formed using this method looked healthy and were vertically orientated giving layered shoots a better chance at survival. </p...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, total {{chlorophyll}} a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids, anthocyanin, carbohydrate, phenolic constituents, antioxidant activity and root formation percentage of MM 106 apple rootstock in etiolated and green stem cuttings were investigated. The rooting studies {{were carried out}} climatic room in dark and daily period at 25 °C. Chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, carotenoids and anthocyanin contents of etiolated stems were significantly lower than green stems. Similarly, total phenolic and carbohydrate contents and antioxidant activity were found lower in etiolated stems but root formation percentage increased significantly with <b>etiolation...</b>|$|E
40|$|Plant B-box domain {{proteins}} (BBX) mediate many light-influenced developmental processes including seedling photomorphogenesis, seed germination, shade avoidance and photoperiodic {{regulation of}} flowering. Despite {{the wide range}} of potential functions, the current knowledge regarding BBX proteins in major crop plants is scarce. In this study, we identify and characterize the StBBX gene family in potato, which is composed of 30 members, with regard to structural properties and expression profiles under diurnal cycle, <b>etiolation</b> and de-etiolations. Based on domain organization and phylogenetic relationships, StBBX genes have been classified into five groups. Using real-time quantitative PCR, we found that expression of most of them oscillates following a 24 -h rhythm; however, large differences in expression profiles were observed between the genes regarding amplitude and position of the maximal and minimal expression levels in the day/night cycle. On the basis of the time-of-day/time-of-night, we distinguished three expression groups specifically expressed during the light and two during the dark phase. In addition, we showed that the expression of several StBBX genes is {{under the control of the}} circadian clock and that some others are specifically associated with the <b>etiolation</b> and de-etiolation conditions. Thus, we concluded that StBBX proteins are likely key players involved in the complex diurnal and circadian networks regulating plant development as a function of light conditions and day duration...|$|E
40|$|Red {{and blue}} light {{pathways}} interact {{with one another}} to guide the phototropic growth and development of seedlings. Both roots and hypocotyls experience phototropism. This study aims to describe the effects of red light on blue-light phototropism and {{to examine the relationship between}} red and blue light pathways. Two wild-type ecotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana, germinated either under white light or in darkness, were exposed to different red and blue light conditions and used to examine these relationships. 	Red light exposure preceding growth under solely blue light was shown to have an inhibitory effect on root lengths, regardless of ecotype or <b>etiolation.</b> Surprisingly, red light did not produce significant phototropistic curvature in roots of either ecotype. The remainder of the results illustrated the fact that different ecotypes exhibit different phototropistic responses to light treatments and <b>etiolation.</b> Seedlings did not uniformly respond to constant red and blue light in the same manner as they responded to pretreatment by red light. In different circumstances, simultaneous red and blue light led to results statistically identical to blue light’s results, red pretreatment’s results, or an intermediate between the two. 	Our results both highlight the importance of testing multiple ecotypes within a species and reveal interesting trends in the relationship between red and blue light pathways. Red and blue light pathways interact, but different Arabidopsis ecotypes respond to each light treatment and germination condition differently, and have differing capacities to prioritize one pathway over the other when both are available...|$|E
