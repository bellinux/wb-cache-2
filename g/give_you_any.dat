500|$|The Journal {{supported}} {{the retention of}} the Spanish colonies taken during the war, including the Philippines, but Mr. Dooley dissented, anticipating {{that there would be}} far more advantage for Americans who would exploit the islands than for the Filipinos whose lot imperialists said they were anxious to improve. [...] "'We can't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> votes, because we haven't more than enough to go around now, but we'll treat you the way a father should treat his children if we have to break every bone in your bodies.

In the finals, Kentucky faced three-time defending tournament champion Alabama, which was without forward Andre Perry, who suffered a broken foot in the semifinals against Arkansas. Star sophomore Jamal Mashburn led all scorers with 28 points on 12-of-14 shooting, en route to an 8054 victory and tournament Most Valuable Player honors. Mashburn, who shot 26-for-31 in the Wildcats' three tournament games, said of his performance, [...] "At the beginning of the season, I told the four seniors 'this is the only thing I can give you. I can't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> presents, but I can give you an SEC championship. We gave them a present they really deserved." ...|$|E

500|$|Walter Yetnikoff, the {{president}} of Jackson's record company CBS Records, approached MTV about playing the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video, which MTV had not ever played in spite of Jackson's success as a musical artist. Yetnikoff became enraged when MTV refused to play the video, and he threatened {{to go public with}} MTV's stance on racial discrimination. [...] "I said to MTV, 'I'm pulling everything we have off the air, all our product. I'm not going to <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> more videos. And I'm going to go public and fucking tell them about the fact you don't want to play music by a black guy.'" [...] MTV relented and played the [...] "Billie Jean" [...] video in heavy rotation.

Keating commented, [...] "I can't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> explanations, I can't give you excuses, because there are none. Jobs weren't done, {{responsibilities}} weren't met and justice wasn't served." [...] Bishop's parents, who claim that the Braintree officers lied about the events at the station, issued a statement after the indictment.

2500|$|In {{his review}} for The Hollywood Reporter, Arthur Knight wrote [...] "Coonskin is not anti-black. Nor is it anti-Jewish, anti-Italian, or anti-American, {{all of whom}} fall prey to Bakshi's wicked caricaturist's pen as {{intensely}} {{as any of the}} blacks in his movie. What Bakshi is against, as this film makes abundantly clear, is the cheats, the rip-off artists, the hypocrites, the phonies, the con men, and the organized criminals of this world, regardless of race, color, or creed." [...] The film is most critical in its portrayal of the Mafia. According to Bakshi, [...] "I was incensed at all the hero worship of those guys in The Godfather; Pacino and Caan did such a great job of making you like them. [...] One thing that stunned me about The Godfather movie: here's a mother who gives birth to children, and her husband essentially gets all her sons killed. In Coonskin, she gets her revenge, but also gets shot. She turns into a butterfly and gets crushed. [...] These [...] guys don't <b>give</b> <b>you</b> <b>any</b> room." ...|$|E
