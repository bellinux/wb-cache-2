5|$|An {{important}} component of the Bretton Woods agreements was the creation of two new international financial institutions, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD). Collectively referred to as the Bretton Woods institutions, they became operational in 1947 and 1946 respectively. The IMF was established to support the monetary system by facilitating cooperation on international monetary issues, providing advisory and technical assistance to members, and offering emergency lending to nations experiencing repeated difficulties restoring the balance of payments equilibrium. Members would contribute funds to a pool according to their share of gross world product, from which emergency loans could be issued. Member states were authorized and encouraged to employ capital controls as necessary to manage payments imbalances and meet pegging targets, but prohibited from relying on IMF financing to cover particularly short-term capital hemorrhages. While the IMF was instituted to guide members and provide a short-term financing window for recurrent balance of payments deficits, the IBRD was established to serve as a type of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> for channeling global capital toward long-term investment opportunities and postwar reconstruction projects. The creation of these organizations was a crucial milestone {{in the evolution of the}} international financial architecture, and some economists consider it the most significant achievement of multilateral cooperation following World War II. Since the establishment of the International Development Association (IDA) in 1960, the IBRD and IDA are together known as the World Bank. While the IBRD lends to middle-income developing countries, the IDA extends the Bank's lending program by offering concessional loans and grants to the world's poorest nations.|$|E

Though on the other hand, an entity whose income is less than its expenditure can raise capital by borrowing or selling equity claims, decreasing its expenses, or increasing its income. The lender can find a borrower—a <b>financial</b> <b>intermediary</b> such as a bank—or buy notes or bonds (corporate bonds, government bonds, or mutual bonds) in the bond market.

40|$|The authors {{extend the}} recent {{literature}} on the link between financial development and economic volatility {{by focusing on the}} channels through which the development of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> affects economic volatility. Their theoretical model predicts that well-developed <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> dampen the effect of real sector shocks on the volatility ofgrowth while magnifying the effect of monetary shocks-suggesting that, overall, <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> have no unambiguous effect on growth volatility. The authors test these predictions in a panel data set covering 63 countries over the period 1960 - 97, using the volatility of terms of trade to proxy for real volatility, and the volatility of inflation to proxy for monetary volatility. They find no robust relationship between the development of <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> and growth volatility, weak evidence that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> dampen the effect of terms of trade volatility, and evidence that <b>financial</b> <b>intermediaries</b> magnify the impact of inflation volatility in low- and middle-income countries.
