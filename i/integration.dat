40|$|BACKGROUND: Arthropod-borne viruses (arboviruses) {{transmitted}} by mosquito vectors cause many important emerging or resurging infectious diseases in humans including dengue, chikungunya and Zika. Understanding the co-evolutionary processes among viruses and vectors {{is essential for}} the development of novel transmission-blocking strategies. Episomal viral DNA fragments are produced from arboviral RNA upon infection of mosquito cells and adults. Additionally, sequences from insect-specific viruses and arboviruses have been found integrated into mosquito genomes. RESULTS: We used a bioinformatic approach to analyse the presence, abundance, distribution, and transcriptional activity of <b>integrations</b> from 425 non-retroviral viruses, including 133 arboviruses, across the presently available 22 mosquito genome sequences. Large differences in abundance and types of viral <b>integrations</b> were observed in mosquito species from the same region. Viral <b>integrations</b> are unexpectedly abundant in the arboviral vector species Aedes aegypti and Ae. albopictus, in which they are approximately ~ 10 -fold more abundant than in other mosquito species analysed. Additionally, viral <b>integrations</b> are enriched in piRNA clusters of both the Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus genomes and, accordingly, they express piRNAs, but not siRNAs. CONCLUSIONS: Differences in the number of viral <b>integrations</b> in the genomes of mosquito species from the same geographic area support the conclusion that <b>integrations</b> of viral sequences is not dependent on viral exposure, but that lineage-specific interactions exist. Viral <b>integrations</b> are abundant in Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus, and represent a thus far underappreciated component of their genomes. Additionally, the genome locations of viral <b>integrations</b> and their production of piRNAs indicate a functional link between viral <b>integrations</b> and the piRNA pathway. These results greatly expand the breadth and complexity of small RNA-mediated regulation and suggest a role for viral <b>integrations</b> in antiviral defense in these two mosquito species...|$|R

60|$|One of the propositions {{supported}} by evidence {{was that in}} animals the process of development is carried on, not by differentiations only, but by subordinate <b>integrations.</b> Now in the social organism we may see the same duality of process; and further, {{it is to be}} observed that the <b>integrations</b> are of the same three kinds. Thus we have <b>integrations</b> which arise from the simple growth of adjacent parts that perform like functions: as, for instance, the coalescence of Manchester with its calico-weaving suburbs. We have other <b>integrations</b> which arise when, out of several places producing a particular commodity, one monopolizes {{more and more of the}} business, and leaves the rest to dwindle: witness the growth of the Yorkshire cloth-districts at the expense of those in the west of England; or the absorption by Staffordshire of the pottery-manufacture, and the consequent decay of the establishments that once flourished at Worcester, Derby, and elsewhere. And we have those yet other <b>integrations</b> which result from the actual approximation of the similarly-occupied parts: whence result such facts as the concentration of publishers in Paternoster Row, of lawyers in the Temple and neighbourhood, of corn-merchants about Mark Lane, of civil engineers in Great George Street, of bankers in the centre of the city. Finding thus that in the evolution of the social organism, as in the evolution of individual organisms, there are <b>integrations</b> as well as differentiations, and moreover that these <b>integrations</b> are of the same three orders; we have additional reason for considering these <b>integrations</b> as essential parts of the developmental process, needed to be included in its formula. And further, the circumstance that in the social organism these <b>integrations</b> are determined by community of function, confirms the hypothesis that they are thus determined in the individual organism.|$|R
