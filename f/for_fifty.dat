5000|$|Bearing the {{dedication}} [...] "In Loving Memory of Rock 'n' Roll 1950-∞: Never Really Passed Away Just Ran Out of Time", Entwistle's affection <b>for</b> <b>Fifties</b> {{rock and roll}} was evident by covers of [...] "Mr. Bass Man", [...] "Hound Dog", and [...] "Lucille". As George Lucas had released American Graffiti {{at the same time}} as Rigor Mortis Sets In was released, creating a huge market <b>for</b> <b>Fifties</b> nostalgia, Entwistle's timing was uncannily prescient. In Entwistle's original material for the album, light whimsy prevailed over the darker (and more creative) vein of Smash Your Head Against the Wall and Whistle Rymes. The album was completed in less than three weeks, ultimately costing $10,000 in studio time and $4,000 on liquor bills.|$|R

5|$|King {{was born}} in Philadelphia in 1873. Early in his life, he worked in a linen trade. Although this was the family business, his father later allowed him to leave to enter the {{insurance}} industry. King was {{not a member of}} the aristocratic and wealthy families of Philadelphia that produced many of the era's top cricketers. King's obituary in Cricket Quarterly suggests that his career in insurance was set up for him by those families to allow him to continue playing the game. In 1913 (or 1911), King married Fannie Lockhart; the marriage lasted <b>for</b> <b>fifty</b> years. King's wife died in 1963, and he died in 1965 in his native Philadelphia two days before his 92nd birthday.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia Genesis {{starts with}} the history of {{schizophrenia}}. Gottesman takes the view that schizophrenia is a disease of the industrial world. because it is not mentioned in the Bible, by the ancient Greeks, the ancient physicians, or authors including Shakespeare. He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by Balzac in a short story in 1832, showing minimally the disorder had by then been recognized as such. In 1896, Kraepelin defined its symptoms, and his student Ernst Rüdin began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916.} The book noted that schizophrenia existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady <b>for</b> <b>fifty</b> years.|$|E

Once all participating countries have announced their results, the country that has received the most points is declared the winner of that year's contest.|$|E
5|$|The Ionian Revolt was {{primarily}} of significance as the opening chapter in, and causative {{agent of the}} Greco-Persian Wars, which included the two invasions of Greece and the famous battles of Marathon, Thermopylae and Salamis.
