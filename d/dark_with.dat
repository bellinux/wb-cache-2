5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the <b>dark</b> <b>with</b> a pale blue light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E

The game is frequently cited {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. A remaster, also titled Perfect <b>Dark,</b> <b>with</b> enhanced graphics and online multiplayer, was released for the Xbox 360 in 2010.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, it was {{announced}} that a younger John Constantine would feature in Justice League Dark, one of the new titles launched as part of September 2011's DC Universe reboot. He was {{to be part of a}} team including Shade, The Changing Man, Deadman and Madame Xanadu, known as Justice League Dark. As part of the DC universe reboot in September 2011, Peter Milligan started the title which featured an alternate version of John Constantine as a prominent part of the team. Milligan wrote eight issues of Justice League <b>Dark,</b> <b>with</b> writer Jeff Lemire taking over on issue nine.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 14-19 mm. The forewings dusty medium to <b>dark</b> orange-brown <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> grey antemedial and postmedial lines and a dark grey discal spot. The hindwings are pinkish red with a black marginal band and dark veins. Females are usually larger and <b>darker,</b> <b>with</b> the forewing pattern better developed. Adults are on wing from late spring to August in one generation per year.|$|R
50|$|Adults are pale grey marbled irregularly <b>with</b> <b>dark</b> brown, <b>with</b> no salient markings.|$|R

5|$|Mathilde is very <b>dark,</b> <b>with</b> an albedo {{comparable}} to fresh asphalt, and {{is thought to}} share the same composition as CI1 or CM2 carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, with a surface dominated by phyllosilicate minerals. The asteroid {{has a number of}} extremely large craters, with the individual craters being named for coal fields and basins around the world. The two largest craters, Ishikari (29.3km) and Karoo (33.4km), are as wide as the asteroid's average radius. The impacts appear to have spalled large volumes off the asteroid, as suggested by the angular edges of the craters. No differences in brightness or colour were visible in the craters and there was no appearance of layering, so the asteroid's interior must be very homogeneous. There are indications of material movement along the downslope direction.|$|E
5|$|Pyxis lies in {{the plane}} of the Milky Way, {{although}} part of the eastern edge is <b>dark,</b> <b>with</b> material obscuring our galaxy arm there. NGC 2818 is a planetary nebula that lies within a dim open cluster of magnitude 8.2. NGC 2818A is an open cluster that lies on line of sight with it. K 1-2 is a planetary nebula whose central star is a spectroscopic binary composed of two stars in close orbit with jets emanating from the system. The surface temperature of one component has been estimated at as high as 85,000K. NGC 2627 is an open cluster of magnitude 8.4 that is visible in binoculars.|$|E
5|$|Seven {{subspecies}} {{have been}} named but the largely contiguous populations show clinal variation and intergrade with each other. Individuals from northern India (ssp. albirictus) are larger than those from the Sri Lankan population minor while those from the peninsular India (nominate subspecies) are intermediate in size. Race cathoecus is found in Thailand, Hong Kong and China. This race has a much smaller rictal spot and the wings are <b>dark</b> <b>with</b> a greenish gloss. In southern Siam a race thai is resident, but overlaps with wintering cathoecus. Race javanus is found on the islands of Java and Bali. Race harterti found in Formosa has the tail length less than the wing.|$|E
50|$|The {{wingspan}} {{is about}} 11 mm. The forewings are elongate and <b>dark</b> purple-fuscous, <b>with</b> light-blue reflections. The hindwings are <b>dark</b> fuscous <b>with</b> bronzy reflections.|$|R

5|$|Sonic Adventure 2 is a 3D {{game with}} six playable {{character}}s, {{divided into two}} campaigns: Hero (with Sonic, Tails and Knuckles the Echidna, where the player battles to save the world) and <b>Dark</b> (<b>with</b> Shadow the Hedgehog, Doctor Eggman and Rouge the Bat, where they battle to conquer it). Each character on each side has a playing style similar to the other characters on the side. The player moves through the Hero and Dark campaigns, switching between them at will. Each campaign cycles through levels of its three characters, telling different sides of the story. Levels {{have a variety of}} themes (such as cities, jungles, desert pyramids and outer space), with some followed by boss fights. The two campaigns' stories occur in parallel; completing both campaigns unlocks a Last Story with all six characters, culminating in a final boss fight.|$|E
5|$|The Australian Cattle Dog is a sturdy, muscular, compact {{dog that}} gives the {{impression}} of agility and strength. It has a broad skull that flattens to a definite stop between the eyes, with muscular cheeks and a medium-length, deep, powerful muzzle. The ears are pricked, small to medium in size and set wide apart, with a covering of hair on the inside. The eyes are oval and <b>dark,</b> <b>with</b> an alert, keen expression. The neck and shoulders are strong and muscular; the forelegs are straight and parallel; and the feet round and arched, with small, sturdy toes and nails.|$|E
5|$|The plumage is {{generally}} light gray-brown and lighter and pinkish below. The wings have black spotting, {{and the outer}} tail feathers are white, contrasting with the black inners. Below the eye is a distinctive crescent-shaped area of dark feathers. The eyes are <b>dark,</b> <b>with</b> light skin surrounding them. The adult male has bright purple-pink patches on the neck sides, with light pink coloring reaching the breast. The crown of the adult male is a distinctly bluish-grey color. Females are similar in appearance, but with more brown coloring overall and a little smaller than the male. The iridescent feather patches on the neck above the shoulders are nearly absent, but can be quite vivid on males. Juvenile birds have a scaly appearance, and are generally darker.|$|E

5|$|Falco peregrinus peregrinator, {{described}} by Sundevall in 1837, {{is known as}} the Indian peregrine falcon, Shaheen falcon, Indian shaheen or shaheen falcon. It was formerly sometimes known as Falco atriceps or Falco shaheen. Its range includes South Asia from Pakistan across India and Bangladesh to Sri Lanka and Southeastern China. In India, the shaheen is reported from all states except Uttar Pradesh, mainly from rocky and hilly regions. The Shaheen is also reported from the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. It has a clutch size of 3 to 4 eggs, with the chicks fledging time of 48 days with an average nesting success of 1.32 chicks per nest. In India, apart from nesting on cliffs, it has also been recorded as nesting on man-made structures such as buildings and cellphone transmission towers. A population estimate of 40 breeding pairs in Sri Lanka was made in 1996. It is non-migratory, and is small and <b>dark,</b> <b>with</b> rufous underparts. In Sri Lanka this species is found to favour the higher hills while the migrant calidus is more often seen along the coast.|$|E
5|$|Kurosawa's three {{consecutive}} movies after Seven Samurai had not managed to capture Japanese audiences {{in the way}} that that film had. The mood of the director's work had been growing increasingly pessimistic and <b>dark,</b> <b>with</b> the possibility of redemption through personal responsibility now very much questioned, particularly in Throne of Blood and The Lower Depths. He recognized this, and deliberately aimed for a more light-hearted and entertaining film for his next production, while switching to the new widescreen format that had been gaining popularity in Japan. The resulting film, The Hidden Fortress, is an action-adventure comedy-drama about a medieval princess, her loyal general and two peasants who all need to travel through enemy lines in order to reach their home region. Released in December 1958, The Hidden Fortress became an enormous box office success in Japan and was warmly received by critics both in Japan and abroad. Today, the film is considered one of Kurosawa's most lightweight efforts, though it remains popular, not least because it is one of several major influences on George Lucas's 1977 space opera, Star Wars.|$|E
5|$|The Olympic venues were {{designed}} to reflect Norwegian culture and character. The hall was designed to play on Scandinavian folklore, such as the Hall of the Mountain King in Henrik Ibsen's Peer Gynt and the caves of fairy-tale trolls. This has for instance been emulated {{through the use of}} shotcrete on the walls to give a dark and mysterious impression. Lighting is used to create high contrast, such as from the entrance which is <b>dark</b> <b>with</b> pools of light, to the main hall which is brightly lit, to emphasize its size. The dark entrance is also used to adjust the spectators' eyes so the main hall seems brighter. A contrast has also been used between the grandstands' slender lines and the coarse finish of the cavern rock. Red was chosen as the hall's main color because of natural occurrence of red in the rock. Glass tiles are used as they give associations to ice. Ventilation, energy and other installations use shine metal, representing silver embedded in the rock. The main hall is designed as an amphitheater with close contact between spectators and athletes.|$|E
50|$|The colour of {{the head}} is {{primarily}} <b>dark</b> brown <b>with</b> white markings. The first segment of the labial palp is short and white, while the second segment is <b>dark</b> brown <b>with</b> white longitudinal lines. The third segment is also white. The antennae are <b>dark</b> brown <b>with</b> a white line from the base to two-thirds up.|$|R
