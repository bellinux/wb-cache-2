5|$|In the present, former Imperial knight Yuri Lowell goes on {{a mission}} to {{retrieve}} his neighborhood's blastia core from a nobleman when their reservoir fails. While on his mission, he encounters a noble woman called Estelle, and flees with her from the capital in pursuit of the blastia thief. On their journey, they also meet Karol, a trainee hunter separated from his guild; a blastia researcher named Rita; Raven, a Great War veteran; Judith, a Krytia who seeks to destroy the blastia harming the aer balance; and exclusive to the PS3 version only, seemingly the <b>descender</b> of a legendary pirate Aifread named Patty Fleur. Together, the group recover the stolen core from a corrupt guild leader and return it to Yuri's friend and former fellow knight Flynn. Yuri and Karol then decide to form an independent guild called Brave Vesperia. Shortly after this, Estelle is attacked by an Entelexeia called Phaeroh, who accuses her of poisoning the planet. After investigating and meeting a second time with Phaeroh, Brave Vesperia learn that Estelle is a Child of the Full Moon, capable of converting aer into magic without the aid of a blastia core, and that her actions are causing the aer krene, the sources of aer, to overproduce aer with deadly results. Alongside these events, Yuri sees that the Imperial authorities are powerless to act against powerful figures involved in blastia abuse: he takes matters into his own hands and murders two officials connected to the abuses. These acts put a strain on his friendship with Flynn.|$|E

25|$|Gloves protect {{hands from}} {{the rope and}} from hits with the wall. They are mainly used by {{recreational}} abseilers, industrial access practitioners, adventure racers and military as opposed to climbers or mountaineers. In fact, they can {{increase the risk of}} accident by becoming caught in the <b>descender</b> in certain situations.|$|E
25|$|Releasable abseil - Used by some guides with inexperienced abseilers. A rope {{is set up}} by {{anchoring}} it with a munter hitch and locking off the non-rappelling {{strand of}} the rope. The client descends on the non-locked strand of the rope. The guide unlocks the other strand and lowers the client or the rappeller if the client gets into trouble. Useful with an inexperienced rappeller or when the rappeller gets into trouble, for example, by getting {{a piece of clothing}} or hair entangled in the <b>descender.</b>|$|E

5|$|The Deseret {{alphabet}} was purposely {{designed so}} as to not have ascenders and <b>descenders.</b> This was envisioned as a practical benefit for the alphabet {{in an era of}} metal type: after many uses, the edges of type sorts become dull, and narrow ascenders and <b>descenders</b> are most prone to this effect.|$|R
25|$|Tandem or spider rappelling ‚Äî Involves two climbers {{descending}} on {{the same}} belay device. This is done in some rescue situations {{when one of the}} climbers is incapacitated or the descent needs to be done quickly. The set-up is similar to a regular rappelling set-up with the first climber is girth hitched off a sling into the <b>descender</b> on the carabiner, and has an auto-block from belay loop of the harness to the rope as a backup. The second rappeller is also girth hitched into the belay device on the carabiner and also anchored into the main rappeller's harness as a back-up.|$|E
25|$|As {{with many}} metal type faces, the metal type of Akzidenz-Grotesk shows {{variation}} between sizes, with adaptation of letter-spacing and proportions to different sizes. In addition, there is variation between weights: Karl Gerstner notes that even comparing one size (20pt), the medium and bold weights have different x-height, cap height and <b>descender</b> length {{to the light}} and regular weights. This is common with nineteenth-century sans-serifs, which were often not designed as {{with the intention of}} forming an extended family that would match together. The differences in proportions between different sizes and weights of Akzidenz-Grotesk has led to a range of contemporary adaptations, reviving or modifying different aspects of the original design.|$|E
500|$|Three letters {{have both}} {{ascender}}s and descenders, like √æ in Old English: [...] ·É•, ·É≠, and (in handwriting) ·ÉØ. ·É¨ has both ascender and <b>descender</b> in print, {{and sometimes in}} handwriting.|$|E

50|$|These {{devices are}} {{friction}} brakes which {{are designed for}} descending ropes. Many belay devices {{can be used as}} <b>descenders,</b> but there are <b>descenders</b> that are not practical for belaying, since it is too difficult to feed rope through them, or because they do not provide sufficient friction to hold a hard fall.|$|R

500|$|Jordan {{is named}} after the Jordan River, where Jesus {{is said to have}} been baptised. The origin of the river's name is debated, but the most common {{explanation}} is that it derives from the word [...] "yarad" [...] (the <b>descender,</b> [...] "Yarden" [...] is the Hebrew name for the river), found in Hebrew, Aramaic, and other Semitic languages. Others regard the name as having an Indo-Aryan origin, combining the words [...] "yor" [...] (year) and [...] "don" [...] (river), reflecting the river's perennial nature. Another theory is that it is from the Arabic root word [...] "wrd" [...] (to come to), as in people coming to a major source of water.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contained}} several elaborate stunts {{and effect}} sequences. Gish performed {{all of her}} stunts in the episode, including one shot when she jumped from a thirty-foot <b>descender.</b> She later called the sequence [...] "the biggest stunt of my career." [...] For several of the special effect shots, Manners was forced to compromise on his original decision. One specific shot, wherein Audrey Pauley had to disappear after appearing in front of Gish, was originally {{going to be done}} via CGI. Eventually, Manners decided to [...] "tie the two actresses [...] together [...] and then you [...] to Annabeth and in her face there's an 'oh shit' reaction, and then [...] straight up on a crane, all right, and see that she's completely alone." [...] He called effects like these [...] "creative ways to trim [...] budget." [...] To create the floating hospital scene, a small door set was merged with a CGI hospital. Initially, the scene used a straight flat [...] "piece of cement" [...] as the bottom of the building. The effects team tried adding a [...] "big piece of earth" [...] under the building, but Paul Rabwin felt it looked too much like The Little Prince, so the piece of earth was removed. The final result also removed the cement-like base.|$|E

500|$|On stage 13 into Lourdes, which {{included}} a passage over the hors cat√©gorie climb Col d'Aubisque, Moncouti√© figured into a ten-man breakaway. Given the lack of overall threat in the group, the peloton did not mount a serious chase, meaning the stage winner would come from this group of ten. 's J√©r√©my Roy {{broke away from the}} group on the way up the climb. Moncouti√© strenuously chased him, with Thor Hushovd following behind. The other breakaway riders all faded, finishing five minutes back on the stage. Roy crested the Aubisque first, and Moncouti√© second. Hushovd, a rider known as a very strong <b>descender,</b> caught up with Moncouti√© on the way down the Aubisque. With a short flat section still to race after the descent, Moncouti√© and Hushovd worked cohesively as a chase group behind Roy. They caught and passed Roy [...] {{from the end of the}} stage, and Hushovd eventually dropped Moncouti√© as well to be the solo stage winner; Moncouti√© finished second and Roy third. Moncouti√© was roundly criticized by the French press for collaborating with Hushovd in the chase, with Roy (a fellow Frenchman) up the road. To that point in the Tour, no French rider had yet won a stage. Team manager Boyer defended Moncouti√©, saying Hushovd was likely to surpass Roy and win any sprint at the end of the stage no matter what, and by working with him Moncouti√© assured himself second place rather than falling to third.|$|E
500|$|The film's Yosemite {{scenes were}} all shot on location. Long shots of Kirk scaling the {{mountain}} were filmed with stunt doubles, while Shatner's closer shots had {{him on a}} fiberglass set positioned {{in front of the}} camera, with the real mountains visible in the background. Aided by two trainers, Shatner had spent weeks at the Paramount lot, learning to climb a wooden replica. Laszlo scouted out a tall peak on which the production created a rock face with safety net. The overhead shot gave the impression Kirk was climbing at a great height, while unnatural background features such as swimming pools were camouflaged. In the scene, Spock watches Kirk's ascent, and saves him when he slips and falls using levitating boots. Most of the shots framed Nimoy from the waist up; in these scenes the actor was supported by a crane that gave the appropriate [...] "float" [...] to achieve the effect. Bluescreen footage of Shatner falling was shot later at Paramount and composited, while stuntman Ken Bates set a record for the highest American <b>descender</b> fall by plummeting off El Capitan‚Äî with a wire support rig‚Äî for long shots. In reviewing the dailies of the first two days of shooting, the production realized that a pine tree in the frame during Kirk and Spock's mountain dialogue ruined the illusion of height, while a shot of Shatner clinging to the face of El Capitan appeared muddy due to clouds obscuring the sun and ruining the depth of field. The scenes had to be reshot later.|$|E
500|$|After a stage {{each for}} the {{breakaway}} and the sprinters, during {{which there were}} no major changes to the overall standings, the riders were faced with the very climbing-intensive final two road stages. The [...] team rode a very hard tempo in stage 19 over the Passo del Mortirolo, which eventually whittled that group down to just Basso, Nibali, and Scarponi. They crossed the Mortirolo more than two minutes ahead of Arroyo, which was nearly enough time to make Basso the virtual race leader. Arroyo, noted as a far better <b>descender</b> than Basso, took very aggressive lines coming down the Mortirolo and caught up with Vinokourov, Sastre, Evans, and John Gadret, who had been {{between him and the}} leading trio. Basso's group had only 30 seconds on Arroyo's {{at the start of the}} stage-concluding Aprica climb, but they took more and more time as the climb went on and finished three minutes ahead, giving Basso the pink jersey with two days left to race. Arroyo elected not to try to aggressively descend any of the four large climbs on course in the final road race stage, settling for second place by riding with Basso and the other top riders in the peloton most of the day. There were a few changes in time gaps, but the same riders remained in the top ten from the previous day, as Johan Tschopp won the stage from a breakaway. The individual time trial in Verona which closed out the Giro also provided for small changes to the overall, but Basso's 15th place on the stage was easily enough to make him Giro champion. Arroyo and Nibali rounded out the podium.|$|E

500|$|The team {{set about}} taking time {{back in the}} high {{mountain}} stage 18, ending with an hors cat√©gorie arrival at the Col du Galibier. Monfort and Posthuma both made the morning breakaway, providing support for Andy Schleck after he attacked out {{of the group of}} overall favorites on the ascent of the Col d'Izoard. Schleck bridged first to Posthuma and then to Monfort, the latter guiding him down the [...] long descent of the Izoard, as Schleck is a superlative climber but a poor <b>descender.</b> After catching and surpassing all other remaining members from the morning breakaway, Monfort then rode an extremely lengthy and strenuous pull ahead of Schleck until [...] remained in the stage, when he finally bonked and dropped back. This left Andy free to climb the Galibier solo, taking the stage win alone two minutes ahead of the next rider, which happened to be brother Fr√§nk. He rode clear of the group of the race's top riders in the final kilometer, gaining eight seconds against Evans. While the team's tactics on the day appeared to cinch the yellow jersey for Andy, prior race leader Voeckler retained the yellow jersey by a margin of 15 seconds. The status quo among the Schlecks and Evans held on stage 19, though with Voeckler finally falling {{from the top of the}} overall classification that gave Andy Schleck the yellow jersey ahead of the stage 20 individual time trial. Stage 19, ending at Alpe d'Huez, had favored Schleck ahead of Evans, and he was characterized as missing an important opportunity to pad his lead ahead of the time trial, where Evans' skills are superior.|$|E
