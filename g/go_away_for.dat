5|$|In Pasadena, {{high school}} {{students}} Costa and J.B. plan to throw a party for their friend Thomas' birthday, aiming to increase their popularity. Thomas' parents <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> the weekend, leaving him alone in the house, but warn him not to have too many people over, and not to drive his father's Mercedes. Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan. Costa hires AV-student Dax to chronicle the night's events. Costa and J.B. advertise the party throughout the school. Thomas himself invites Alexis, the hottest girl at school, and his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on Thomas.|$|E
500|$|In {{celebration of}} its 40th year, the Good Vibrations: 40th Anniversary Edition EP was released. The EP {{includes}} [...] "Good Vibrations", four alternate {{versions of the}} song, and the stereo mix of [...] "Let's <b>Go</b> <b>Away</b> <b>for</b> Awhile".|$|E
500|$|Produced by Wilson, the {{recording}} was initiated during the sessions for the 1966 album Pet Sounds, {{and was not}} originally issued as a track from an album, {{but rather as a}} stand-alone single, with the Pet Sounds instrumental [...] "Let's <b>Go</b> <b>Away</b> <b>for</b> Awhile" [...] as the B-side. [...] "Good Vibrations" [...] was envisioned for the unfinished album Smile, but instead appeared on the 1967 substitute LP Smiley Smile. Most of the song was developed as it was recorded. Its title derived from Wilson's fascination with cosmic vibrations, after his mother once told him as a child that dogs sometimes bark at people in response to their [...] "bad vibrations". He used the concept to suggest extrasensory perception, while Love's lyrics were inspired by the Flower Power movement that was then burgeoning in Southern California.|$|E

500|$|In November 2013, Feige {{said that}} [...] "in an ideal world" [...] {{releases}} each year would include one film {{based on an}} existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's [...] "a nice rhythm" [...] in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so I {{think it would be}} fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> four years just because we don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E
2500|$|The album {{included}} two sophisticated instrumental tracks composed solely by Brian. One of them: the wistful [...] "Let's <b>Go</b> <b>Away</b> <b>for</b> Awhile". the other instrumental {{is the title}} track, [...] "Pet Sounds". Both titles had been recorded as backing tracks for existing songs, {{but by the time}} the album neared completion Wilson had decided that the tracks worked better without vocals. Of [...] "Let's <b>Go</b> <b>Away</b> <b>for</b> Awhile", Perone observes, [...] "There are melodic features but no tune to speak of. As an instrumental composition, this gives the piece an atmospheric feel; however, the exact mood is difficult to define." [...] Of [...] "Pet Sounds", the piece represents the Beach Boys' surf heritage more than any other track on the album with its emphasis on lead guitar, although Perone maintains that it is not really a surf composition, citing its elaborate arrangement involving countless auxiliary percussion parts, abruptly changing textures, and de-emphasis of a traditional rock band drum set.|$|E
2500|$|Regarding the band's {{eventual}} return, Ed Droste noted, [...] "Coming {{back together}} {{to try to}} write and record was like being in junior high again – after you <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> the summer, {{the first couple of}} weeks are slightly awkward when you get back to school. Then, you get back into the swing." [...] Daniel Rossen elaborated, [...] "The whole process with this record felt like starting over. We took enough time off that we... I don't know. My head kind of went out of the game or something. Getting back into it was really confusing. It took a long time." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{signing a}} {{recording}} deal with Polydor Records in July 2009, Goulding's debut album, Lights, {{was released in}} February 2010 to generally positive reviews from music critics. The album debuted at {{number one on the}} UK Albums Chart, and has since sold 740,723 copies in the United Kingdom and 1.6 million copies worldwide. In February 2011, Goulding told the Daily Star that she had plans to release a follow-up to Lights sometime in 2011, commenting, [...] "I'm not going to <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> ages. It'll be out this year or the start of next." [...] In April 2012, Goulding stated that she hoped the album would be released in October 2012.|$|E
2500|$|The {{teachers}} also had special needs. Upon arriving in England, the overriding concern {{was to make}} a good home for the children. At {{the end of the first}} year, the teachers had been available to the children without any time off or uninterrupted privacy for themselves. While they were elated that things were going so well, they were exhausted. That changed with the establishment of [...] "off-duty" [...] time to refresh oneself. [...] "It became possible to read, to write a letter, to <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> a few hours or a weekend without being interrupted or missed" [...] wrote Hanna Bergas. She noted that the return to the community was always a joy.|$|E
2500|$|The {{laceration}} {{may also}} close up by itself, {{which can cause}} it to trap blood and potentially form a cyst or hematoma. [...] Because the lung is elastic, the tear forms a round cyst called a traumatic air cyst that may be filled with air, blood, or both and that usually shrinks {{over a period of}} weeks or months. Lacerations that are filled with air are called pneumatoceles, and those that are filled with blood are called pulmonary hematomas. In some cases, both pneumatoceles and hematomas exist in the same injured lung. [...] A pneumatocele can become enlarged, for example when the patient is mechanically ventilated or has acute respiratory distress syndrome, in which case it may not <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> months. [...] Pulmonary hematomas take longer to heal than simple pneumatoceles and commonly leave the lungs scarred.|$|E

2500|$|Tony meets Theresa McQueen (Jorgie Porter) on a {{night out}} at The Loft. Tony, unaware Theresa is fifteen years old and Jacqui's cousin, has sex with Theresa. Pickard said that upon Jacqui {{discovering}} Tony's one-night stand with Theresa she [...] "storms round and starts thwacking him, screaming he's slept with her 15-year-old cousin! What's worse is that Theresa is making out Tony practically raped her". Pickard explained that Theresa wants a relationship with Tony but Tony tells her a relationship won't happen. Pickard explained that Tony is arrested and [...] "his life goes into freefall". Pickard {{went on to say}} that if [...] "he's found guilty then he'll probably have to do time. If he's let off, I think the best thing would be for him to <b>go</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> a while to sort himself out".|$|E
2500|$|With {{production}} by Wilson, the Beach Boys covered Bacharach's [...] "My Little Red Book" [...] and [...] "Walk On By" [...] in 1967 and 1968 but left the recordings unreleased. Wilson {{has said that}} Bacharach was a direct influence on his [...] "She Knows Me Too Well", [...] "Let's <b>Go</b> <b>Away</b> <b>for</b> Awhile", and [...] "Love and Mercy". Writers have variously attributed Bacharach influence on Wilson's [...] "Guess I'm Dumb", [...] "Let Him Run Wild, and [...] "The Little Girl I Once Knew". Discussing [...] "Let's Go Away", Wilson said: [...] "there {{were a lot of}} chord changes similar to the way he would put something together. And I think that his music had such a profound thing on my head; he got me going in a direction." [...] He mentions [...] "minor seventh chords" [...] as a specific point of influence.|$|E
2500|$|... "Then again," [...] Kent says, [...] "bearing in {{mind this}} {{conceptual}} bent, {{there are certain}} incongruous factors about the album's construction. The main one is {{the inclusion of the}} hit single 'Sloop John B', as well as of two instrumental pieces." [...] Perone argues, [...] "To the extent that the listener hears 'Let's <b>Go</b> <b>Away</b> <b>for</b> Awhile' as an incomplete piece, it is possible to understand it as a reflection of the alienation—the sense of not quite fitting in—of the bulk of Tony Asher's lyrics in the songs on Pet Sounds." [...] Noting that a sense of self-doubt, concern for the future of a relationship, and melancholy pervades Pet Sounds, Perone claims in reference to [...] "Sloop John B" [...] that the song successfully portrays a sailor who feels [...] "completely out of place in his situation [...] is fully in keeping with the general feeling of disorientation that runs through so many of the songs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has <b>gone</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> a {{time out}} of {{consideration}} for me," [...] said the widow. [...] "As things are, {{it is a little}} bit awkward for us to meet much at present." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, he {{will come}} back! He couldn't leave me! He's dead,--I know he's dead; but {{he will come}} back! He only <b>went</b> <b>away</b> <b>for</b> the night, and {{something}} must have happened to him." ...|$|R
