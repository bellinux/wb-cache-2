25|$|As {{with other}} criteria, {{stability}} {{is the critical}} consideration in evaluating the effect of orbital and rotational characteristics on planetary habitability. Orbital eccentricity {{is the difference between}} a planet's farthest and closest approach to its parent star divided by the sum of said distances. It is a ratio describing the shape of the elliptical orbit. The greater the eccentricity the greater the temperature fluctuation on a planet's surface. Although they are adaptive, living organisms can stand only so much variation, particularly if the fluctuations overlap both the freezing point and boiling point of the planet's main biotic solvent (e.g., water on Earth). If, for example, Earth's oceans were alternately boiling and freezing solid, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> {{life as we know it}} having evolved. The more complex the organism, the greater the temperature sensitivity. The Earth's orbit is almost wholly circular, with an eccentricity of less than 0.02; other planets in the Solar System (with the exception of Mercury) have eccentricities that are similarly benign.|$|E

25|$|The first {{seeks to}} resolve a longstanding debate in {{historical}} linguistics by making a case for the Kurgan hypothesis {{on the origins of}} the Indo-European language group. The Kurgan theory holds that Indo-European speakers came from lands between the Black and Caspian seas before spreading their language by conquest. The authors suggest that dairy farming and a complementary adaptation - the ability to digest lactose in adulthood - lie behind their conquests. With a walking food source, the milk-drinking warriors defeated their plant-growing neighbours. Drinking milk, from cows, horses, or camels, is a behavior shared by many of history’s greatest conquering peoples, whether Kurgans, Scythians, Arabs, or Mongols. Without continuing evolution, the ability to digest milk could never have arisen. In fact, it has done so several times, in different ways, in various places, and it has helped shape human history. Kelleher comments that the authors’ argument makes it <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the language in which their book would have been written, {{were it not for the}} ability to digest milk.|$|E

In our sample, the discount rate is highly correlated with the ability <b>to</b> <b>imagine</b> the future and graduates with a high discount rate make less adequate investment choices. Pure discounting lowers the value of all future consumption whereas a lack of imagination will especially lower the value of specific situations that are more <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be <b>imagined.</b> So while in general high discount rates are associated with lower investments, the uncertainty related to the transition from school to work is a counteracting force that stimulates high discounters to stay longer in education. Consistent with this we show that on the one hand students with a high discount rate put less effort per time period in their study. On the other hand, we find persistent evidence that high discounters stay longer in school...|$|R
