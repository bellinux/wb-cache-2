5|$|Despite {{reproducing}} readily {{in captivity}} {{and being the}} most populous lemur in zoos worldwide, numbering more than 2,000 individuals, the ring-tailed lemur is listed as endangered by the IUCN Red List due to habitat destruction and <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> bush meat and the exotic pet trade. As of early 2017, {{the population in the}} wild is believed to have crashed as low as 2,000 individuals due to habitat loss, poaching and hunting, making them far more critically endangered.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hunting</b> <b>for</b> ivory is {{responsible}} for significant reductions in elephant populations in several parts of Africa. Between 1979 and 1989, the African elephant population decreased in size from 1.3million to 600,000. Ivory became a billion-dollar market, with about 80% of the supply taken from illegally killed elephants. , {{according to a report}} by the Wildlife Conservation Society, about 96 African elephants are killed for their tusks every day.|$|E

5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail is threatened by habitat loss (even within nature reserves), <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
5|$|Like all jumping spiders, M. inclemens has {{excellent}} vision.

The remaining three pairs of eyes are {{along the sides of}} the head, and work as motion detectors. The eyes are used for <b>hunting,</b> <b>for</b> avoiding threats and for finding and wooing mates. Almost all jumping spiders are predators, mostly preying on insects, on other spiders, and on other arthropods.|$|E

5|$|The Little Ice Age {{may have}} reduced the {{population}} of the great auk by exposing more of their breeding islands to predation by polar bears, but massive exploitation by humans for their down drastically reduced the population. By the mid-sixteenth century, the nesting colonies along the European side of the Atlantic were nearly all eliminated by humans killing this bird for its down, which was used to make pillows. In 1553, the great auk received its first official protection, and in 1794 Great Britain banned the killing of this species for its feathers. In St. John's, those violating a 1775 law banning hunting the great auk for its feathers or eggs were publicly flogged, though <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> use as fishing bait was still permitted. On the North American side, eider down initially was preferred, but once the eiders were nearly driven to extinction in the 1770s, down collectors switched to the great auk {{at the same time that}} <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> food, fishing bait, and oil decreased.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{antelope}} prefers {{areas with}} fresh and dense growth of shrubs and other plants.

The royal antelope has been categorised as Least Concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN). The populations are feared to be declining due to habitat deterioration and expanding human settlement. A significant threat {{to the survival of}} this antelope is <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> bushmeat.|$|E

Bellerophon was with the fleet in the Bay of Cadiz until October, when Jervis took it to sea to patrol between Cape Trafalgar and Cape St. Vincent. These duties lasted until late May 1798, when Bellerophon was assigned to a detached squadron under Captain Thomas Troubridge and ordered to rendezvous with and reinforce Nelson's squadron. Nelson was in the Mediterranean <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> a large French fleet which had sailed from Toulon carrying troops.|$|E

While <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> Corbitant, they learned that Squanto had escaped and Massasoit was back in power. Several Native Americans had been injured by Standish and his men and were offered medical attention in Plymouth. They had failed to capture Corbitant, but the show of force by Standish had garnered respect for the Pilgrims and, as a result, nine of the most powerful sachems in the area signed a treaty in September, including Massasoit and Corbitant, pledging their loyalty to King James.|$|E

The British Royal Society for the Protection of Birds, founded as the Plumage League in 1889 to protect birds such as the egret from <b>hunting</b> <b>for</b> their plumes, used in fashion, has grown to have over a million members; it has been followed by similar societies in other countries.
