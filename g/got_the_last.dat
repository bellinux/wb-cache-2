5|$|Stengel, hired {{only days}} before spring training, had but a limited {{opportunity}} to shape his new ballclub. The Dodgers quickly settled into sixth place, {{where they would}} end the season. Stengel, in later years, enjoyed discussing one 1934 game in Philadelphia's Baker Bowl: with Dodger pitcher Boom-Boom Beck ineffective, Stengel {{went out to the}} mound to take out the angry pitcher, who, instead of giving Stengel the baseball, threw it into right field, where it hit the metal wall with a loud noise. The right fielder, Hack Wilson, lost in thought, heard the boom, assumed the ball had been hit by a batter, and ran to retrieve it and throw it to the infield, to be met by general laughter. Stengel <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laughs on the Giants as well. The Giants, six games ahead of the Cardinals on Labor Day, dissipated that lead, and with two games in the season were tied with St. Louis—with the final two games against Brooklyn at the Polo Grounds, games played in front of raucous crowds, who well remembered Terry's comments. Brooklyn won both games, while the Cardinals won their two games against the Cincinnati Reds, and won the pennant. Richard Bak, in his biography of Stengel, noted that the victories over the Terry-led Giants represented personal vindication for the Dodger manager.|$|E
25|$|Tech {{beat the}} Tar Heels 23–3. Early {{in the first}} quarter, Wooch Fielder circled end for 40 yards and a touchdown. Next, two forward passes set up a Tommy Spence run for a touchdown.

25|$|On August 23, the Rangers nearly {{combined}} for a no-hitter against the Minnesota Twins when Rich Harden pitched 6 and 2/3 innings of no-hit ball but was pulled after 111 pitches.

25|$|Hayden kept going, and his {{dismissal}} came in an {{over where}} Australia had taken eight {{runs from the}} first four balls; however, Simon Jones <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh over Hayden, only to later be reprimanded and fined by the ICC for his celebrations. England kept on the pressure, getting three more wickets before the scheduled close of play; Giles getting two, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.|$|E
25|$|Chicago {{would take}} in {{the lead in the}} third quarter with Cutler's 7-yard {{touchdown}} pass to wide receiver Johnny Knox, followed by kicker Robbie Gould's 37-yard field goal. The Seahawks would regain the lead in the fourth quarter with Mare's 39-yard and 46-yard field goal. However, the Bears <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh as Cutler hooked up with wide receiver Devin Hester on a 36-yard touchdown pass (with a successful 2-point conversion pass to wide receiver Earl Bennett). Seattle tried to rally, but Chicago's defense held on for the win.|$|E
25|$|A few overs of {{relative}} calm followed, Hayden forging runs with Martyn but never looking too assured, and his dismissal, came in an over where Australia had actually looked on top. However, Simon Jones <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh over Hayden – only to later be reprimanded by the ICC for his celebrations. England kept muscling on, and despite never playing {{on top of}} their game they got four more wickets before the scheduled close of play. Giles got two of those, dismissing Katich and Gilchrist, and then an inswinging ball from Flintoff took care of Gillespie, who was trapped lbw.|$|E

The challenge started and Sting went first with Savannah going on the swings. She kept falling off and was very slow, but she <b>got</b> to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> swing to get the skull. She tried to get it, but the time ran out. Venom went next with Tahny going on <b>the</b> swings. Tahny <b>got</b> her balance and didn't fall off. She <b>got</b> to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> swing but also couldn't get it. So both teams <b>got</b> to <b>the</b> <b>last</b> swing, but Venom was the fastest and they won.

25|$|At {{the start}} of the second half, Arsenal came out on top, {{constantly}} pressing for an equaliser. They were denied two penalties by referee Lee Probert before they finally got an equaliser in the 71st minute, with centre-back Laurent Koscielny bundling a header from Bacary Sagna over the line following a corner. Many believed that a goal kick should have been given instead of a corner as it appeared that substitute Yaya Sanogo <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> touch. In the 79th minute, Gibbs had a chance to put Arsenal in front when he had just goalkeeper Allan McGregor to beat, but he could not hit the target, shooting high of the goal. Arsenal had another chance for a winning goal in injury time, but Olivier Giroud's shot was saved by McGregor.|$|E
25|$|On that occasion, Reles dragged Irving {{from the}} hallway of his home out into the street. Reles beat, kicked, and then shot Irving {{numerous}} times, killing him. Two months later, Reles met Meyer Shapiro {{on the street and}} killed him by shooting him in the face. Another three years elapsed before Reles finally <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> Shapiro brother, William. William was abducted off the street and taken to a gang hideout. Once there, he was beaten nearly to death, stuffed into a sack, and driven out to the Canarsie section of Brooklyn and buried. Before the gang could finish burying William, a passerby spotted them and they had to flee the scene. William Shapiro's body was exhumed shortly thereafter, and after being autopsied it was determined that he had been buried alive.|$|E
25|$|On 2 September 2013, {{transfer}} deadline day, Barry was loaned to Everton in a season-long deal. He {{made his}} debut on 15 September in a 1–0 home league win against Chelsea {{during which he}} made a block on Samuel Eto'o which prevented a certain goal, later being named man of the match. Later in the month Barry became the 10th player in Premier League history to make 500 career appearances in a 3–2 win over Newcastle United. He scored his first goal for the club in a 2–1 victory over Hull City on 19 October; the goal was originally awarded to Kevin Mirallas; however, the goals panel ruled that {{en route to the}} goal, Barry was deemed to have <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> touch on the ball before it beat Hull keeper Allan McGregor. He scored a long range effort in a 2–0 victory against Norwich City on 11 January 2014. He became a mainstay in Everton's midfield during the season and forged a partnership with James McCarthy. Barry completed the most passes of any Everton player during his spell as he helped the club amass a club record of 72 Premier League points to finish fifth. Barry was booked 10 times during the season to have the worst disciplinary record at the club.|$|E

25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a grubber kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see {{whether or not it was}} Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18–22.|$|E

500|$|In {{his first}} NBA season, Chamberlain {{averaged}} 37.6 points and 27 rebounds, convincingly breaking the previous regular-season records. He needed only 56 games to score 2,102 points, which broke the all-time regular season scoring record of Bob Pettit, who needed 72 games to score 2,101 points. Chamberlain broke eight NBA records, {{and was named}} NBA MVP and Rookie of the Year that season, a feat matched only by fellow Hall-of-Famer Wes Unseld in the 1968–69 NBA season. Chamberlain capped off his rookie season by winning the 1960 NBA All-Star Game MVP award with a 23-point, 25-rebound performance for the East. However, it also became evident {{that he was an}} atrocious free-throw shooter, making hardly half of his foul shots. As time progressed, Chamberlain grew even worse, and acknowledged he was simply a [...] "psycho case" [...] on that matter. The Warriors entered the 1960 NBA Playoffs and beat the Syracuse Nationals, setting up a meeting versus the Eastern Division champions, the Boston Celtics. Cherry described how Celtics coach Red Auerbach ordered his forward Tom Heinsohn to commit personal fouls on Chamberlain: whenever the Warriors shot foul shots, Heinsohn grabbed and shoved Chamberlain to prevent him from running back quickly; his intention was that the Celtics would throw the ball in so fast that the prolific shotblocker Chamberlain was not yet back under his own basket, and Boston could score an easy fastbreak basket. The teams split the first two games, but in Game 3, Chamberlain got fed up with Heinsohn and punched him. In the scuffle, Wilt injured his hand, and Philadelphia lost the next two games. In Game 5, with his hand healthy, Chamberlain scored 50 points. But in Game 6, Heinsohn <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> laugh, scoring the decisive basket with a last-second tip-in. The Warriors lost the series 4–2.|$|E
