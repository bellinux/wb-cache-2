5|$|The Pine Bush is {{also home}} to 30 of the 44 species of {{amphibians}} and reptiles that are indigenous to Albany County. Seven of these species are generally not seen so far north in the state of New York. Three species of salamander, the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma jeffersonium), blue-spotted salamander (Ambystoma laterale), and spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum), are state-listed special concern animals. Two species of turtle, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and wood turtle (Clemmys insculpta), are also special concern animals. About 45 species of birds breed in the Albany Pine Bush (according to the 1985 New York State Breeding Bird Atlas) and are fairly common species for the area. About 32 species of common small mammals have been found in and adjacent to the Pine Bush.|$|E
25|$|The 37 {{amphibian}} and reptile species {{found in}} the area include six deemed to be of special concern by the state: <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander,</b> blue-spotted salamander, spotted salamander, spotted turtle, wood turtle and eastern hognose snake.|$|E
25|$|Duck Pond is a {{woodland}} vernal pool, {{a depression}} in the forest, unconnected to a stream, with a dense soil layer that impedes the water from flowing out easily. This vernal pool is a habitat for several species of plants and animal life, including wood frogs, spring peepers, and three species of salamander: <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma jeffersonianum), spotted salamander (Ambystoma maculatum); and marbled salamander (Ambystoma opacum).|$|E
50|$|Lacking its own males, the LJJ biotype breeds {{with male}} Blue-Spotted or <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Salamanders</b> from March to April. The males' spermatophores only stimulate egg development; their genetic {{material}} does {{not contribute to}} the offspring's DNA. This mode of reproduction is called gynogenesis. The females lay cylindrical egg masses and attach them to underwater twigs. It is not often observed and its diet and lifestyle are unknown.|$|R
500|$|In the Nescopeck Creek watershed, {{there are}} seven natural areas. These are Arbutus Peak, Valmont Industrial Park, the Black Creek flats, the Humboldt barrens, the Nescopeck Creek valley, and the Edgewood vernal pools. Arbutus Peak is a [...] area at Nescopeck Creek's headwaters. Also, the Nescopeck Barrens are home to 15 rare species of plants and animals. The Nescopeck Creek valley also {{contains}} a number of rare species. The Edgewood vernal pools provide {{a breeding ground for}} wood frogs and <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamanders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamanders</b> {{are one of}} {{the first}} {{amphibians}} to emerge in springtime at the northern edge of their range in southern Ontario where they are seen [...] "snowshoeing" [...] across the still frozen understory of the forest to reach partially melted breeding ponds. Males migrate first with females following shortly thereafter. These salamanders have small pores on their heads which exude a whitish liquid when they are handled, suggesting that they may leave a scent trail during migration, Ambystoma jeffersonianum is often found in the same habitat as the spotted salamander.|$|R
2500|$|The project's design {{took into}} account several {{considerations}} for rare or endangered species native to the area, which earned it an Exemplary Ecosystem Initiative award from the Federal Highway Administration. [...] These included the construction of 12 vernal pools adjacent to the road to provide habitat for the Blue-spotted Salamander and <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Salamander</b> and box culverts {{to allow them to}} safely cross under the road, avoiding tree removal during the season when Indiana bats are roosting, and siting new wetlands to avoid impacting Purple milkweed.|$|E
50|$|A unique {{reproductive}} tactic for the Bluespotted-Jefferson Salamander Complex {{exists in}} nature. The <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> {{is now known}} not to breed in the lab with the blue-spotted salamander, which was previously thought to produce 'hybrids', the silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander, between this supposed mating of <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> and Blue-spotted salamander. The silvery salamander and Tremblay's salamander are now known through genetic testing to be polyploid females (only 2% of males survive and they are sterile). These most often possess two of each chromosome from the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> and one of each chromosome from the blue-spotted salamander, resulting in an LJJ genotype (also called a Tremblay's salamander.) This genotype results when these polyploid females mate with a pure <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> male, incorporating (often in warmer water conditions) the chromosome from the pure male <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> into her egg, usually having an LJ diploid chromosome set or LJJ triploid chromosome set, to produce LJJ or LJJJ offspring, respectively. Often in cooler conditions, the LJ or LJJ female may mate with the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> male and only 'borrow' his spermatozoan to trigger genetic cloning of herself, not adding his chromosome (J) to her egg. The same polyploid reproductive strategy occurs for other mole salamander species. The presence of these polyploids {{makes it difficult to}} visually identify which species an individual may be, skewing population measures for both species.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Jefferson</b> <b>{{salamander}}</b> (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) is a mole salamander {{native to}} the northeastern United States, southern and central Ontario, and southwestern Quebec. It was named after Jefferson College in Pennsylvania.|$|E
5000|$|Tremblay's {{salamander}} (Ambystoma tremblayi) is {{a member}} of the family Ambystomidae from the United States of America and Canada. Reaching between 3¾ and 6⅜" [...] (9.3 and 16 cm), the salamander is long and slender with many bluish-white markings. It is dark gray to gray-black and the area around the vent is black. Tremblay's salamander is a hybrid species of <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamanders</b> (A. jeffersonianum) and blue-spotted salamanders (A. laterale). This hybridization created two all-female species: Tremblay's and silvery salamanders. These genetic curiosities possess three sets of chromosomes instead of the normal two.|$|R
50|$|Adults {{spend most}} of their time in their burrows or under logs, as is the case with most mole {{salamanders}}. Juvenile marbled salamanders hatch early compared to most salamanders and gain a size advantage by feeding and growing for several months before the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamanders</b> and spotted salamanders hatch later in the spring. Larvae typically mature as quickly as two months in the southern part of their range, but take up to six months to mature in the northern part.Marbled salamanders, like other members of this genus, are reported to have relatively long life spans, 8-10 years or more.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, York Region {{conducted}} several road needs studies near Lake Wilcox, which {{determined that the}} disjointed and disconnected Bayview Avenue should be connected from Stouffville Road {{in the south to}} Bloomington Road in the north. A lengthy battle ensued between environmentalists, upset over continuing construction in the supposedly protected Oak Ridges Moraine. The discovery of <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamanders</b> in the study area resulted in several modifications to the design of the route, including a 70 m structure over a dry ravine, as well as five amphibian tunnels. On November 17, 2002, the new extension was opened, including a widened intersection at Stouffville Road. The former route of Bayview was turned into several short streets, which lie directly west of the new roadway.|$|R

50|$|Like other mole salamanders, the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> burrows; {{they have}} {{well-developed}} lungs suited for this purpose. Nocturnal by nature, {{they can be}} spotted by day during the mating season. Breeding occurs in early spring, after the snow in the area has melted.|$|E
40|$|Mole {{salamanders}} (Ambystoma) and woodfrogs (Lithobates sylvaticus) {{are abundant}} in New England and depend on ephemeral wetlands for breeding. Their aquatic habitats {{have been well}} studied and are protected by several local and regional regulations. State endangered species laws also protect mabled <b>salamanders</b> (A. opacum), <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamanders</b> (A. jeffersonianum), and blue-spotted salamanders (A. laterale). However, these amphbibians {{spend most of their}} adult lives in terrestrial habitats that remain poorly protected and elusive to researchers. In chapter 1, I developed a novel technique using passive integrated transponders for tracking small animals. I used this technique to track marbled salamanders walking up to 200 m from their breeding pond during post-breeding migrations. In Chapter 2, I examined the importance of multiple habitat variables for predicting the distributions of woodfrogs and spotted salamanders at 455 ponds in western Massachusetts. Based on a variable-comparison technique I developed, the best predictor for either species of amphibian was the amount of forest in the surrounding vii landscape. Both species were found more frequently in upland forests where the ponds are least protected by state and federal wetland regulations. In chapter 3, I used my data from chapter 2 and three other similar data sets to conduct an analysis of spatial scale and to parameterize a recently published resistant kernel model. The complex model parameterized by an expert panel did significantly worse than the null model. The distributions of both amphibians were best predicted by measuring the landscape at very large scales (over 1000 m). The most effective scales for conservation may be largest for organisms of intermediate dispersal capability. In chapter 4, I explored the evolution and genetics of the Jefferson/blue-spotted/unisexual salamander complex. I framed research into the fascinating unisexual reproductive system with a model that relates nuclear genome replacement, positive selection on hybrids, and biogeography of the species complex. I parameterized this model using genetic data taken from salamanders spanning Massachusetts and an individual-based breeding simulation. If paternal genomes are transmitted to offspring with the frequencies reported from laboratory experiments, then my model suggests that there must be strong selection favoring unisexuals with hybrid nuclei...|$|R

5000|$|The {{access road}} {{required}} some deep cuts {{to keep it}} level at the intersection with Drury Lane. Bill Gorton, NYSDOT's regional design engineer, compared it to the initial construction of I-84. [...] "We tell our young engineers {{to take a good}} look at what we're doing here because chances are they won't see anything like this again in their careers", said Rashid Shariff, DOT's engineer in charge. Over [...] of dirt were moved. A quarter of that was used to fill a ravine the road crosses; the rest will be used as needed on the airport property.The project's design took into account several considerations for rare or endangered species native to the area, which earned it an Exemplary Ecosystem Initiative award from the Federal Highway Administration. These included the construction of 12 vernal pools adjacent to the road to provide habitat for the Blue-spotted Salamander and <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Salamander</b> and box culverts to allow them to safely cross under the road, avoiding tree removal during the season when Indiana bats are roosting, and siting new wetlands to avoid impacting Purple milkweed.|$|E
50|$|The nuclear DNA of the unisexuals {{generally}} comprises genomes from {{up to five}} species: the {{blue-spotted salamander}} (A. laterale), <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> (A. jeffersonianum), small-mouthed salamander (A. texanum), streamside salamander (A. barbouri), and tiger salamander (A. tigrinum), denoted respectively as L, J, T, B, and Ti. This flexibility results in {{a large number of}} possible nuclear biotypes (genome combinations) in the unisexuals. For example, an LJJ individual would be a triploid with one A. laterale genome and two A. jeffersonianum genomes, while an LTJTi individual would be a tetraploid with genomes from four species. Because they have hybrid genomes, unisexual salamanders are a cryptic species with morphology similar to coexisting species. For example, LLJs look like blue-spotted salamanders and LJJs look like Jefferson salamanders. Silvery salamanders LJJ (A. platineum), Tremblay's salamanders LLJ (A. tremblayi), and Kelly's Island salamanders LTT and LTTi (A. nothagenes) were initially described as species. Species names were later dropped for all unisexual salamanders because of the complexity of their genomes. The offspring of a single mother may have different genome complements; for example, a single egg mass may have both LLJJ and LJJ larvae.|$|E
40|$|Amphibian {{populations that}} use small {{isolated}} wetlands are often small in size, susceptible to stochastic extinction processes, and {{have little to}} no contact with other populations. One can ascertain the persistence of such populations only by obtaining data that allow the prediction of future changes in population’s size, and propensity to achieve a sustainable number of individuals. The number of metamorphosing larvae leaving a pond predicts the viability of a salamander population, and thus, the number recruited into the terrestrial adult population. The <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Salamander,</b> Ambystoma jeffersonianum, is a listed threatened species in Illinois, occurring at fewer than 15 ponds statewide. In 2004 and 2005, individuals at an isolated breeding pond in Lincoln Trail State Recreation Area (LTSRA) were captured using a drift fence-pitfall trap array. Once captured, we determined sex, measured snout-vent length, and using a unique combination of toe clips, marked the salamanders. We also determined the number of egg masses, average percentage of successfully hatched eggs, and number of juveniles leaving the pond. We incorporated this information into a matrix for a stage-based population model. Model simulations predicted that on average, the population at the LTSRA pond would persist for four more years, with survivorship from larvae to juvenile being the most important parameter. Increasing survivorship during the larval period increased abundance as well as average persistence time. Active management at the breeding pond to increase the time available for successful metamorphosis might facilitate persistence of the salamander at this site...|$|E
40|$|In {{terrestrial}} habitats {{with a history}} of mining activity and previous or ongoing reclamation efforts, understanding the effects of acidification on the ecology of amphibians {{is an important part of}} the restoration process and the conservation of local amphibian populations. Pond-breeding amphibians spend much of their post metamorphic life history in direct contact with the soil in upland habitat adjacent to aquatic breeding sites. I reared recently metamorphosed marbled salamanders (Ambystoma opacum) to evaluate the role of soil acidity on determinants of fitness such as growth and survival. My results indicate that a substrate of pH 4 was lethal to recent A. opacum metamorphs. Among animals surviving the higher pH treatments, we found that individuals reared on a pH 5 substrate suffered a reduction in total length and snout vent length by the end of the experiment. The mechanisms of acidity are complex; both hydrogen ions and anions contribute to negative effects on amphibians. Sulfuric acid has larger negative effects than other acids and sulfates can cause reductions in growth without a change in pH. I reared larval spotted (Ambystoma maculatum) and Jefferson salamanders (Ambystoma jeffersonianum) to evaluate the effects of pH and sulfates on two species with differential acid resistances. My results indicate that a pH of 4 is lethal to larval salamanders of both species. In high sulfate treatments there was an early reduction in growth in the spotted salamander, but not in the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> showing that acid resistance applies to the effects of sulfates as well as hydrogen ions. Together, our results suggest that acid and sulfate deposition can affect the fitness of Ambystoma salamanders through direct mortality and a decrease the growth rate of salamanders both as larvae and subsequent to metamorphosis...|$|E
40|$|Bayview Avenue is an {{important}} north-south arterial road link in the road network of the York Region, Ontario, Canada. The roadway passes through {{a portion of the}} Oak Ridges Moraine (ORM), one of Ontario’s most significant landforms as recognized through the Oak Ridges Moraine Conservation Act (2001) and Plan (2002). McCormick Rankin Corporation (MRC) and its subsidiary, Ecoplans Limited, were retained by the proponent, York Region, to plan and design the 4. 5 -km missing-link Bayview Avenue extension from Stouffville Road north to Bloomington Road. This two-lane rural roadway was planned and designed to support the Region’s growth (within the Greater Toronto area) while being sensitive to topography and natural-environmental features. Forest, wetland, and kettle features; Lake St. George Conservation Field Center uses; and wildlife habitat/movements were key resource issues and challenges recognized by the project team throughout the planning, design, and construction work. Accordingly, an innovative environmental-management and enhancement program was developed and implemented during the project. The objectives were to reduce and mitigate effects on the natural environment, provide habitat creation and wildlife passage, advance the body of environmental research and education, and secure agency approvals. The wetland-habitat creation project was developed in consultation with Education Centre field staff, and incorporated the following: a) creation of a three-cell experimental wetland complex outdoor “laboratory” located in a cultural meadow and connecting existing natural areas well removed from Bayview Avenue; b) protection of archaeological finds that were integrated in the wetland creation project; c) provision of trail and lookout zones; and d) provision of added habitat diversity in what was a cultural meadow. The planning and design of the roadway also integrated an amphibian-migration study and detailed literature review on wildlife crossings. In response to this work, recognition of the reported presence of the rare <b>Jefferson</b> <b>Salamander</b> in the area, and the desire to maximize roadway permeability for wildlife, dedicated amphibian tunnels were located and installed under the roadway. In addition, a three-span 81 -meter bridge was installed across an open dry ravine to maintain the ORM landscape character and provide a 14 -meter vertical clearance for wildlife movement. The Individual EA for the road project was successfully delivered in 1998 and the design was completed in 2001. The road was opened to traffic in 2002. Post-construction monitoring at the amphibian tunnels (spring 2003, 2004) and recent observations (2005) have confirmed use by a variety of species including small mammals, Wood Frog, American Toad, Leopard Frog, and Spring Peeper. Use by target salamanders has not yet been confirmed. Challenges encountered include water ponding in some tunnels and some landscape changes from residential development. Outdoor education uses of the created wetland area have been very positive and will likely expand in the future. In conclusion, the environmental-management program for the roadway was instrumental in securing agency approvals for the project. These efforts were also acknowledged by the naturalist community. The science of wildlife-crossing mitigation has been advanced and some challenges associated with tunnel design and landscape changes have been noted. Further tunnel monitoring has been recommended. Tangible environmental and educational benefits have been realized with the wetland-habitat creation project.

40|$|Construction of a 6. 5 -kilometer (4 -mile) two-lane access roadway {{has been}} {{proposed}} to provide airport patrons with improved access to Stewart International Airport in Orange County, New York. The project design, environmental review and permitting process were a joint effort between the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) and the New York State Thruway Authority (NYTA). While {{the majority of the}} new access roadway will utilize an existing road network, an approximately one-mile portion will pass through extensive secondary growth forest on the southwest side of the airport. This area is in close proximity to the 6, 000 -acre Stewart State Forest. A 1. 12 -kilometer (0. 7 -mile) length of this alignment passes through a valley containing a complex of emergent and forested wetlands and a headwater stream. In order to minimize potential impacts to two New York State Species of Special Concern, the spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata) and the <b>Jefferson</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma jeffersonianum), as well as other wildlife species, a mitigation plan was devised to replace wetland habitat utilized by these species. The mitigation plan also includes four underpasses to maintain a connection between upland forest and wetland habitats {{on either side of the}} roadway. The mitigation plan was developed in a collaborative effort with the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (NYSDEC), NYSDOT, NYTA and The Louis Berger Group, Inc. (Berger). Berger developed a design plan for the construction of 12 vernal pools in close proximity to the impacted wetlands to provide supplemental breeding habitat for several herpetile species. The 12 pools range in size from 0. 01 to 0. 13 hectares (0. 04 to 0. 33 acre), with a combined total area of 0. 55 hectares (1. 37 acres). The site selection, vernal pool design, water budget analysis, and plan and specifi cation preparation was a collaborative effort between biologists and engineers. Several criteria were used to select the best possible sites for pool construction. These criteria took multiple factors into consideration including proximity to existing wetlands, upslope drainage areas, forest quality, site topography, soil characteristics, and availability of adjacent upland buffer habitat. The design places major emphasis on site hydrology since this would be the determining factor for target species use of these habitats. The intended inundation hydroperiod (March through July) was based on the target species breeding requirements and was the basis of determining if an individual vernal pool site could be successful. Water budgets were developed for each proposed site to determine the necessary design elements required to establish naturally functioning vernal pool hydrology. Controlling infl uences such as pool watershed, subsoil infi ltration rates, precipitation rates, and substratum composition were all accounted for in the water budget analysis. Other elements such as maintaining a closed tree canopy and incorporating leaf litter to provide an appropriate substrate were addressed in the design. The mitigation plan also calls for the minimization of habitat fragmentation through the incorporation of wildlife passages. The roadway design incorporates the use of amphibian barriers at three locations to prevent herpetiles from entering the travel lanes of the new road and to direct them to pairs of culverts designed to provide passage through the roadway embankment. Two larger 12 -ft by 8 -ft con-spans were also incorporated into the design to provide deer, coyote and other mammals a safe point to cross beneath the roadway. The underpasses are openbottom box culverts with an openness ratio of 0. 85. Upon construction, a fi ve-year monitoring program will be implemented by NYSDOT that will include monitoring both the herpetile colonization and use of the vernal pools, wildlife utilization of the wildlife underpasses, and road kills along the road segment. Information gathered from this mitigation plan would be adapted to other projects undertaken by NYSDOT and NYTA as appropriate...|$|E
