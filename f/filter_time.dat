50|$|Provided the <b>filter</b> <b>time</b> {{constant}} τ = RC {{is set to}} sufficiently large {{values with}} respect to the gate width, the output voltage is to a good approximation the integral of the input signal with a signal bandwidth of B = 1/(4RC). The output of this filter can then be subjected to another analog circuit for subsequent averaging. After each trigger event this sampling circuit has to be set back before receiving the next pulse. The time it takes for this reset {{is one of the major}} speed limitations for analog implementations, where maximum trigger rates of a few 10 kHz are typical even though the gate width itself can be as low as a few ten picoseconds and delay is set to zero.|$|E
5000|$|In signal {{processing}} terms, the MACD series is a filtered {{measure of the}} derivative of the input (price) series with respect to time. (The derivative is called [...] "velocity" [...] in technical stock analysis). MACD estimates the derivative {{as if it were}} calculated and then filtered by the two low-pass filters in tandem, multiplied by a [...] "gain" [...] equal to the difference in their time constants. It also can be seen to approximate the derivative as if it were calculated and then filtered by a single low pass exponential filter (EMA) with time constant equal to the sum of time constants of the two filters, multiplied by the same gain. [...] So, for the standard MACD <b>filter</b> <b>time</b> constants of 12 and 26 days, the MACD derivative estimate is filtered approximately by the equivalent of a low-pass EMA filter of 38 days. The time derivative estimate (per day) is the MACD value divided by 14.|$|E

Implicit sinusoidal trends are suitably detected by considering the scaling of the fluctuation functions.

To evaluate which other factors influence <b>filter</b> survival <b>time.</b> Randomized, prospective, double-blind, crossover study. An 18 -bed intensive care unit in a 530 -bed teaching hospital. Thirty-two critically ill patients with renal failure, treated with high-volume, continuous venovenous hemofiltration. High-volume, postdilutional continuous venovenous hemofiltration, with a standard blood flow rate of 200 mL/min and an ultrafiltrate volume of 100 L in 24 hrs, was performed with a highly permeable, large-surface cellulose triacetate membrane. Anticoagulation with anti-Xa bioequivalent doses of nadroparin and dalteparin was administered in the extracorporeal line before the filter. Blood was sampled for determination of coagulation variables before hemofiltration, 0. 5, 2, 4, 6, and 12 hrs after starting the treatment, {{and at the end}} of the hemofiltration run. Anti-Xa peak activity, time of anti-Xa peak activity, area under the curve for 0 - 3 hrs and <b>filter</b> survival <b>time</b> were not significantly different using nadroparin or dalteparin. When analyzing the patients according to the length of <b>filter</b> survival <b>time,</b> no relationship among anti-Xa peak activity, area under the curve for 0 - 3 hrs, and <b>filter</b> survival <b>time</b> was found. However, there was a strong trend toward a negative correlation between baseline platelet count and <b>filter</b> survival <b>time</b> (r 2 =. 11; p =. 07). Mean blood urea nitrogen decreased from 81. 0 +/- 31. 9 to 41. 1 +/- 21. 2 mg/dL (p <. 01) and mean creatinine decreased from 3. 4 +/- 1. 8 to 1. 9 +/- 1. 2 mg/dL (p <. 01). There were no clinically important bleeding complications. Nadroparin and dalteparin are bioequivalent with respect to their anti-Xa activities. Using either drug, we did not find a difference in <b>filter</b> survival <b>time</b> during high-volume, continuous venovenous hemofiltration.

As the number of users grows and the information available becomes even bigger {{it is crucial to}} employ scalable and efficient representation and filtering techniques. In this paper we propose an innovative XML filtering system that uti-lizes clustering of user profiles {{in order to reduce the}} filtering space and achieves sub-linear <b>filtering</b> <b>time.</b> The proposed system employs a unique sequence representation for user profiles and XML documents based on the depth-first traversal of the XML tree and an appropriate distance metric in order to compare and cluster the user profiles and filter the incoming XML documents.

During steady state operation, the drive current for the subscriber loop allows the loop to respond to changes in loop conditions according to a steady state time constant of the loop filter. Upon detection of a line voltage transient which exceeds a predetermined threshold in either a positive or negative direction, the <b>filter</b> <b>time</b> constant is significantly reduced (e. g., 100 : 1) and held at such reduced value following the initial transient and for a predetermined time period after the line voltage has fallen back below such predetermined threshold.

30|$|Filtering is a {{standard}} mathematical operation which in our case is used to enhance features, {{as it is a}} long-term trend, otherwise not visibly apparent in the data.

Special care is therefore required when making inferences from <b>filtered</b> <b>time</b> series.|$|R
30|$|The {{transformation}} {{from the time}} domain to the frequency domain is accomplished using MATLAB software. This transformation gives the square root of the power spectra of grayscale values as it varies with frequency, {{also referred to as}} the grayscale spectral energy distribution. The filtered data is read into MATLAB from the spreadsheet using the “xlsread” function. This function’s inputs are the file path and the range of cells in the spreadsheet that contain the data. The function’s output is an array of the filtered data. The array of the <b>filtered</b> <b>time</b> sequence data undergoes a single sided discrete fast Fourier transform. This transform is done using the Fast Fourier Transform —“fft”— function in MATLAB software. The <b>filtered</b> <b>time</b> sequenced array of grayscale values is input into the Fast Fourier Transform function. The function gives the double sided frequency transform of that time sequenced array. Next, {{the second half of the}} frequency transform array is discarded. The resulting array is the single sided frequency transform.|$|R
30|$|The {{magnitude}} squared coherence {{is determined}} using the “mscohere” subroutine in MATLAB. <b>Filtered</b> <b>time</b> sequence data from two separate pixel locations are inputs to the subroutine. The sampling frequency {{is also an}} input to the “mscohere” subroutine. This subroutine uses Welch’s Overlapped Segment Averaging procedure. Use of this procedure requires input information related to window type, window size, and size of overlapped region. The averaging scheme employs Hanning windowing. The window size is equivalent to {{one quarter of the}} length of the <b>filtered</b> <b>time</b> sequence array of grayscale data. This is the same as a quarter of the number of shadowgraph flow visualization images acquired and analyzed. For example, there are 21, 620 images captured during the test on 05 April 2018, so each window consists of 5405 data points (21, 620 divided by 4). The default size of the overlapped region is also required. This default size is half {{of the size of the}} window length, rounded down. Hence, the windows overlap by 2702 data points.|$|R

Over the oceans, changes in wind speed and the surface gravity waves generated by such winds play an important role. We used a 23 -year database of calibrated and validated satellite altimeter measurements to investigate global changes in oceanic wind speed and wave height over this period. This table summarises the values of trend determined by the various tests, together with 95 % confidence limits for the trend. Several different trend extraction algorithms were used: linear regression; linear plus seasonal; Mann-Kendall test; Seasonal Kendall test and Singular Spectrum Analysis. The target value for the trend in this test is 0. 5 x 10 ^ 2 units/yr. Singular Spectrum Analysis (SSA) was used to 'filter' the time series.

30|$|Recently, the {{low-pass}} filtering algorithm {{has been}} used to achieve the power allocationin between hybrid ES [23, 24, 25]. However, the determination of the <b>filter</b> <b>time</b> constant is less studied. In addition, when the traditional low-pass filtering algorithm (TLFA) is used to achieve power distribution in hybrid ES, the opposite charge and discharge statuses for LB and SC will appear. When LB charges, SC discharges. Conversely, when LB discharges, SC charges. This will lead to power flow between the LB and SC, and the energy loss will increase. Therefore, an ILFA is proposed to improve the operation efficiency of hybrid ES.|$|E

We only show the results for 6  min to 12.8  h here. To <b>filter</b> the <b>time</b> series, a spline was applied, and the splined values used to fill in missing data points.

All the time series were treated in the same way. Equations (1), (3) and (4) are then applied to the <b>filtered</b> <b>time</b> series. The effective beam directions were calculated using the powers measured in each of the off-zenith beams relative to that measured in the vertical beam as described above. The momentum fluxes derived for scales larger than the radar pulse volume calculated using radial velocities we call ‘superscale’, and for scales smaller than the pulse volume calculated using spectral widths, we call ‘subscale’. We calculate the superscale flux using both the VR 83 and least-squares inversion approaches. We begin with the subscale results shown in Fig. 8.|$|R

40|$|The filter term of a PID with Filter {{controller}} {{reduces the}} impact of measurement noise on the derivative action of the controller. This impact is quantified by the controller output travel defined as the total movement of the controller output per unit time. Decreasing controller output travel is important to reduce wear in the final control element. Internal Model Control (IMC) tuning correlations are widely published for PI, PID, and PID with Filter controllers for self regulating processes. For non-self regulating (or integrating) processes, IMC tuning correlations are published for PI and PID controllers but not for PID with Filter controllers. The important contribution of this work is that it completes the set of IMC tuning correlations with an extension to the PID with Filter controller for non-self regulating processes. Other published correlations (not based upon the IMC framework) for PID with Filter controllers fix the <b>filter</b> <b>time</b> constant at one-tenth the derivative time regardless of {{the model of the}} process. In contrast, the novel IMC correlations presented in this paper calculate a <b>filter</b> <b>time</b> constant based upon the model of the process and the user’s choice for the closed-loop time constant. The set point tracking and disturbance rejection performance of the proposed IMC tunings is demonstrated using simulation studies and a bench-scale experimental system.
