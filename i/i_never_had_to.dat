500|$|His {{opinions}} on contemporary cricket were frequently sought. [...] "People {{get a bit}} worried about me," [...] he told Cricinfo in 2008, [...] "Shane Warne's been a fine bowler—no doubt about it, he's done some wonderful things—but Bill O'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett, who have better strike-rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI —they only played against the best—had no rough to bowl at. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> bat to a leg-spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump, and I played for a long time." ...|$|E
500|$|Several {{actors were}} {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Robert Modell, even Lance Henriksen, who went on to play the lead role in Millennium. Initially, Gilligan considered Harvey Fierstein for the role of Modell, but Robert Wisden read the script and [...] "blew us away". Rob Bowman was pleased with Wisden's performance and said, [...] "I thought Robert Wisden was great as Pusher. He is a very energized kind of confident actor with lots of ideas of his own. It took me about {{a day and a half}} to get him into it, and then <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> speak to him again, because he had that look in his eyes. I would walk up to talk to him about the scene and I could see that he was already there.|$|E
500|$|Both men {{describe}} Star Trek {{as having}} put personal pressures on them that negatively affected their family lives. The conversation is mostly guided by Shatner, who prompts Nimoy to discuss issues he had regarding {{the legitimacy of}} consistently portraying an extraterrestrial, and other struggles with his acting career at the time. [...] "It took me a while," [...] Nimoy says, [...] "but I got rid of all that anger when I realized that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> worry about work ever since Star Trek went on the air." [...] Nimoy reveals {{that he was an}} alcoholic {{at the time of the}} original Star Trek series—something that was not publicly known before Mind Meld. He developed [...] "a major drinking habit, probably during the second or third year" [...] of the series, he says, and had his secretary bring him alcohol in paper cups at the end of each day of filming. Nimoy suggests that he became dependent on alcohol because of the deterioration of his marriage to Sandra Zober, his first wife. He says that, since divorcing Zober in 1987 and marrying actress Susan Bay in 1988, he has been a teetotaler.|$|E
60|$|The curious thing is, {{that it was}} at Robert's {{suggestion}} that that particular poem was reprinted there (it <b>never</b> <b>had</b> appeared in England), though 'Barkis was willing'; I had no manner of objection. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> justice.|$|R

One banker described BOLI as a [...] "constantly resetting municipal bond that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> mark to market."

60|$|It was {{fortunate}} for me that, owing to its peculiar cause--indigestion--the irritability and consequent nervousness of Nippers were mainly observable in the morning, {{while in the}} afternoon he was comparatively mild. So that, Turkey's paroxysms only coming on about twelve o'clock, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do with their eccentricities at one time. Their fits relieved each other, like guards.

If I kept my eyes and ears open, I could tell when a hunter was coming and could hide in a hole if I wanted to. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> worry about my meals.

60|$|Few {{excursions}} {{can afford}} {{a better idea of}} the general features and rich luxuriance of the Sikkim Himalaya than that to Tonglo. It is always interesting to roam with an aboriginal, and especially a mountain people, through their thinly inhabited valleys, over their grand mountains, and to dwell alone with them in their gloomy and forbidding forests, and no thinking man can do so without learning much, however slender be the means at his command for communion. A more interesting and attractive companion than the Lepcha I never lived with: cheerful, kind, and patient with a master to whom he is attached; rude but not savage, ignorant and yet intelligent; with the simple resource of a plain knife he makes his house and furnishes yours, with a speed, alacrity, and ingenuity that wile away that well-known long hour when the weary pilgrim frets for his couch. In all my dealings with these people, they proved scrupulously honest. Except for drunkenness and carelessness, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> complain of any of the merry troop; some of whom, bareheaded and barelegged, possessing little or nothing save a cotton garment and a long knife, followed me for many months on subsequent occasions, from the scorching plains to the everlasting snows. Ever foremost in the forest or on the bleak mountain, and ever ready to help, to carry, to encamp, collect, or cook, they cheer on the traveller by their unostentatious zeal in his service, and are spurs to his progress.|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, Mr. Franklin. Now {{listen to}} me. Different women have {{different}} ways of riding the high horse. The late Mrs. Betteredge took her exercise on that favourite female animal whenever I happened to deny her anything that she had set her heart on. So sure as I came home from my work on these occasions, so sure was my wife to call to me up the kitchen stairs, and to say that, after my brutal treatment of her, she hadn't the heart to cook me my dinner. I {{put up with it}} for some time--just as you are putting up with it now from Miss Rachel. At last my patience wore out. I went downstairs, and I took Mrs. Betteredge--affectionately, you understand--up in my arms, and carried her, holus-bolus, into the best parlour where she received her company. I said 'That's the right place for you, my dear,' and so went back to the kitchen. I locked myself in, and took off my coat, and turned up my shirt-sleeves, and cooked my own dinner. When it was done, I served it up in my best manner, and enjoyed it most heartily. I had my pipe and my drop of grog afterwards; and then I cleared the table, and washed the crockery, and cleaned the knives and forks, and put the things away, and swept up the hearth. When things were as bright and clean again, as bright and clean could be, I opened the door and let Mrs. Betteredge in. 'I've had my dinner, my dear,' I said; 'and I hope you will find that I have left the kitchen all that your fondest wishes can desire.' For the rest of that woman's life, Mr. Franklin, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> cook my dinner again! Moral: You have put up with Miss Rachel in London; don't put up with her in Yorkshire. Come back to the house!" ...|$|E
