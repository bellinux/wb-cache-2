A general relativistic aberration relationship is established as one of its applications. The {{question of whether or not}} the cosmological constant, Λ, contributes to orbits of light and to related observable quantities is addressed in detail. We also discuss the ongoing debate on this issue and respond to some recent papers on the topic. The dependence of measurable quantities on the motion of observers is stressed throughout.

50|$|Another {{generalization}} {{of the circle}} packing theorem involves replacing the condition of tangency with a specified <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> between circles corresponding to neighboring vertices. A particularly elegant version is as follows. Suppose that G is a finite 3-connected planar graph (that is, a polyhedral graph), {{then there is a}} pair of circle packings, one whose intersection graph is isomorphic to G, another whose intersection graph is isomorphic to the planar dual of G,and for every vertex in G and face adjacent to it, the circle in the first packing corresponding to the vertexintersects orthogonally with the circle in the second packing corresponding to the face. For instance, applying this result to the graph of the tetrahedron gives, for any four mutuall tangent circles, a second set of four mutually tangent circles each of which is orthogonal to three of the first four. A further generalization, replacing <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> with inversive distance, allows the specification of packings in which some circles are required to be disjoint from each other rather than crossing or being tangent.|$|E

We also assume that for two neighboring circles the corresponding kite built from the two centers of circles and the two intersection points is convex.

Assume that all kites are convex and all angles in the kites are uniformly bounded and the radii of one circle pattern converge to $ 0 $. Then a subsequence of the corresponding discrete conformal maps converges to a Riemann map between the given domains. Comment: 34 pages, 8 figure...|$|R

This river merge adjusts its geometric parameters depending of the characteristics of its confluent rivers, particularly wide and <b>intersection</b> <b>angle.</b> Based on this idea and supported by the availability of satellite images, in this paper we classificated 43 confluences located in Tabasco, Mexico.

Due to difficulty to study many confluences, the best way is to chosee the representative and analyze it.

40|$|Hydraulic {{fracturing}} {{is commonly}} used as a main stimulation method in unconventional reservoirs in which interlayers are common and they may change the local stresses and permeability. Interlayers with different intersection angles with the principal stresses may have different initial stress and permeability, and the hydraulic fracture approaches the interlayer from different angles. In this research, finite element based numerical analysis of hydraulic fracturing {{has been carried out}} to study the stress and permeability variation within interlayers of four different intersection angles. The stresses and permeability variation shows that: (1) the <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> not only influences the stress and permeability of the interlayer, but also determines the timing for the fracture to reach and/or pass the interlayer; (2) the hydraulic fracturing process also influences the stress and permeability within the interlayer, and the higher the <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> is, the higher the stress-coupled permeability is. The results can help us to better understand the influence of <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> on the mutual effect between interlayer and hydraulic fracturing quantitatively towards an optimal design of hydraulic stimulation process...|$|E

40|$|A {{complete}} error calibration {{model with}} 12 independent parameters is established {{by analyzing the}} three-axis magnetometer error mechanism. The said model conforms to an ellipsoid restriction, {{the parameters of the}} ellipsoid equation are estimated, and the ellipsoid coefficient matrix is derived. However, the calibration matrix cannot be determined completely, as there are fewer ellipsoid parameters than calibration model parameters. Mathematically, the calibration matrix derived from the ellipsoid coefficient matrix by a different matrix decomposition method is not unique, and there exists an unknown rotation matrix R between them. This paper puts forward a constant <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> method (angles between the geomagnetic field and gravitational field are fixed) to estimate R. The Tikhonov method is adopted to solve the problem that rounding errors or other errors may seriously affect the calculation results of R when the condition number of the matrix is very large. The geomagnetic field vector and heading error are further corrected by R. The constant <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> method is convenient and practical, as it is free from any additional calibration procedure or coordinate transformation. In addition, the simulation experiment indicates that the heading error declines from ± 1 ° calibrated by classical ellipsoid fitting to ± 0. 2 ° calibrated by a constant <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> method, and the signal-to-noise ratio is 50 dB. The actual experiment exhibits that the heading error is further corrected from ± 0. 8 ° calibrated by the classical ellipsoid fitting to ± 0. 3 ° calibrated by a constant <b>intersection</b> <b>angle</b> method...|$|E

40|$|The {{complex problem}} of {{strength}} verification of a buried steel pipeline crossing the {{trace of a}} normal active fault is treated analytically, and a refined methodology for the calculation of the axial and bending pipeline strains is presented. In essence, the proposed methodology extends the analytical methodology originally proposed by Karamitros et al. [1] for the simpler case of strike-slip fault crossings. The modifications introduced to the original methodology are first identified, following a thorough examination of typical results from advanced 3 D nonlinear numerical analyses, and consequently expressed via an easy to apply solution algorithm. A set of similar numerical analyses, performed {{for a wide variety}} of fault plane inclinations and <b>intersection</b> <b>angles</b> between the pipeline axis and the fault trace, is used to check the accuracy of the analytical predictions. Fairly good agreement is testified for pipeline strains up to 1. 50 - 2. 00 %. It is further shown that, although the methodology proposed herein applies strictly to the case of right <b>intersection</b> <b>angles,</b> it may be readily extended to oblique intersections, when properly combined with existing analytical solutions for strike-slip fault crossings (e. g.
