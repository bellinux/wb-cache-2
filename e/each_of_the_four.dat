5|$|The Big Four, {{along with}} Rod Laver, Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl, {{are the only}} men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single {{calendar}} year.

Similarly, the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have made the semi-finals twice or more at <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> Grand Slam events. Additionally, the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have reached the final at <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> Grand Slam events.

5|$|The temple is {{surrounded}} by a tall stone boundary wall with minarets at <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> corners, suggesting a Muslim influence on the architecture. A Muslim chieftain was patron of the temple at one time. The temple has four gates, each facing a cardinal direction and with an image of Ganesha, each gate depicting him in the form that he appeared in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> ages (yugas). <b>Each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>four</b> Ganesha forms is associated with a Puruṣārtha (aim of life) and accompanied by two attendants. The image of Ballalvinayaka at the eastern gate, accompanied by god Rama (Vishnu's Avatar) and his consort Sita, symbolises Dharma (righteousness, duty, ethnics) and embodies the preserver-god Vishnu. Vignesha at the southern gate, flanked by Ganesha's parents Shiva and Parvati (Uma) symbolises Artha (wealth and fame) and embodies the dissolver – Shiva. Cintamani at the western gate – representing Kama (desire, love and sensual pleasure) – is attended by the love god Kamadeva and his wife Rati and embodies the formless (asat) Brahman. Mahaganapati at the northern gate standing for moksha (salvation), is accompanied by Varaha (Vishnu's boar avatar) and his wife the earth goddess Mahi embodies Sat Brahman.|$|E

The levels represent Danny's mind: a dark city landscape with many tall buildings and the occasional street lamp, a hotel resting aside a seaside location, a dark and mysterious funfair, and a haunted childhood bedroom. Levels are mostly composed of platforms formed by blocks. The player's goal in each level is to collect marbles, which give the player points based on their color. The exit from the level is opened once a predetermined number of points have been collected. Danny can crawl into narrow areas and jump a small height.|$|E
