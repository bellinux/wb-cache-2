25|$|Dnyaneshwar {{was born}} in 1275 (on the auspicious day of Krishna Janmashtami) in Apegaon village {{on the bank of}} Godavari river near Paithan in Maharashtra during the reign of the Yadava king Ramadevarava., The kingdom enjoyed peace and {{stability}} until invasions from the Delhi Sultanate started in 1296 CE. Arts and sciences flourished under the patronage of the Yadava kings and Maharashtra attracted scholars from all over India. However, this period also witnessed religious degeneration, sectarianism, superstition and ritualism which involved animal sacrifices to many local deities. Dnyaneshwar would later criticise the religious degeneration of the <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> magnum opus Dnyaneshwari. According to B. P.

In 1906, the Cumberland Presbyterian Church joined the larger Presbyterian Church in the United States of America.|$|E

Noriega declared the election null and maintained power by force, making him unpopular among Panamanians. Noriega's government insisted that it had won the presidential election and that irregularities had been on the part of U.S.-backed candidates from opposition parties. Bush called on Noriega to honor the will of the Panamanian people. The United States reinforced its Canal Zone garrison, and increased the tempo of training and other activities intended to put pressure on Noriega.|$|E

25|$|For Grayling, work on {{technical}} problems {{is only one}} aspect of philosophy. Another aspect, one which has been at the centre of philosophy's place in history, has more immediate application to daily life: the questions of ethics, which revolve upon what Grayling calls the great Socratic question, 'How should one live?'. In pursuit of what he describes as 'contributing to the conversation society has with itself about possibilities for good lives in good societies.' Grayling writes widely on contemporary issues, including war crimes, the legalisation of drugs, euthanasia, secularism, and human rights. He has articulated positions on humanist ethics and on the history and nature of concepts of liberty as applied in civic life. In support of his belief that the philosopher should engage in public debate, he brings these philosophical perspectives to issues of the <b>day</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> work as a writer and as a commentator on radio and television.|$|E
