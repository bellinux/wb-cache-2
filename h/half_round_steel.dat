40|$|To achieve {{automatic}} labeling {{on the end}} {{surfaces of}} bundles of <b>round</b> <b>steels</b> for the steel plants, {{on the basis of}} the analysis of <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> production process, a set of automatic system for labeling on the <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> end surfaces of bundles is designed. The system includes the robot visual location unit, the label supply unit, the pressure supply unit, the automatic labeling unit, the laser ranging unit, and the host computer communication control unit, etc [...] In the system, the robot visual location unit provides the <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> center location, and the automatic labeling unit implements automatic labeling on the <b>round</b> <b>steel.</b> The system is tested under lab condition, which shows the system can effectively solve the artificial labeling problems such as fault paste and leakage paste of workers, and realize efficient and stable automatic labeling. The system can be used in sleel plants for automatic labeling on the end surfaces of bundles of <b>round</b> <b>steels...</b>|$|R

50|$|In {{all of the}} {{algorithms}} {{the messages}} emanating from check nodes are the same; however, since the verification rules are different for different algorithms the messages produced by variable nodes will be different in each algorithm. The algorithm given above works {{for all of the}} VB-MPA's, and different algorithms use different rules in <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and 2. For instance, Genie algorithm uses D1CN rule in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1, and in fact the <b>half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 2 which uses ZCN rule is useless in Genie algorithm. LM algorithm uses D1CN in <b>Half</b> <b>round</b> 2 of round 1 and XH algorithm uses ECN rule in this stage instead of D1CN. SBB algorithm also uses both D1CN and ECN rule in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1. All of these rules can be efficiently implemented in update_rule function in the second <b>half</b> <b>round</b> of round 1.|$|R

40|$|An {{evaluation}} method of the fatigue durability of the RC slabs for road bridges {{is required to}} effectively manage the maintenance of those, and many researchers have dealt with this problem. However, almost every research emphasizes the RC slabs reinforced with deformed steel bars. On the other hand, it has made clear that many RC slabs reinforced with round bars actually suffer fatal damage and degradation. Under like this condition, in this study, in order to investigate the fatigue durability of the RC slabs reinforced with <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> bars, the wheel running tests was conducted taking two kinds of rebar as variable: deformed and <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> bars. Based on the experimental results, a formula for evaluation of the fatigue lifetime of the slabs reinforced with <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> bars is proposed...|$|R

40|$|This {{project will}} {{investigate}} the local buckling induced fracture behavior of <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> tubes subjected to axial compressive loads, representative of observed failures in buried pipelines during seismic events. Nine initial tests {{will be conducted}} across three lengths of <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> tube: 8 ”, 12 ”, and 20 ”. Another twelve tests will be conducted on the lengths of 12 ” and 20 ” to test varying initial compressive force upon the <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> tubes. Three D/t ratios will be considered for each length of <b>round</b> <b>steel</b> tube: 52. 6, 78. 9, and 121. 2. To verify the material properties of the test specimens an ancillary tensile coupon test will be conducted. Nine tensile coupons will be taken from the specimens, three from each D/t ratio. The coupons will be tested for hardness, ductility, stress capacity, and strain capacity. While the pipe experiments are designed to provide relationships between the geometrical parameters and the cyclic ductility to fracture initiation, {{the results of these}} tests will also inform the critical buckling capacity, and its relationship to the D/t ratio, specimen length and material properties. It is expected the study will result in empirical equations for fracture ductility, critical buckling strain, and the buckling wavelength {{as a function of the}} D/t ratio and length. The experimental results will be used to inform a physics-based fracture model utilizing stress and plastic strain demands from finite element analyses...|$|R
