It is obtained that the resulting design is in the order of one half of the water tank volume, resulting in a more compact configuration which can be easily integrated in the space.

Having some benefits over other traditional processes, this method {{has been able}} to draw attention of researchers working in the field of freshwater production technologies. In this study, a basic AGMD system with flat coolant plate has been modified using a specially designed channelled coolant plate of portable size to observe its effect over the production rate and performance of the system.

40|$|Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) is an {{emerging}} technology for environmental-friendly power generation. Almost all existing CSP plants currently use Water Cooled Condensers, but an {{increasing use of}} Air Cooled Condensers is predictable, because of limited water supplies and high costs of cooling water; furthermore, there are several projects to develop CSP plant in desert areas. The MACCSol research project (Development and verification of a novel modular air cooled condenser for enhanced concentrated solar power generation), funded under the EU 7 th Framework Programme, provides an innovative modular dry cooling approach. During the design phase, that is currently undergone, a typical Modular Air Cooled Condenser (MACC) module 2 X 2 m has been defined; it uses fans of 1 m in diameter {{and it could be}} equipped with three different kinds of tube bundle geometries: circular <b>finned,</b> <b>plate</b> finned and continuous finned.

40|$|Advancements in {{electronics}} {{have created}} the need for improved cooling standards. The AECM standard, created to replace the antiquated ARINC 600 specification for aircraft, draws inspiration from a cooling specification known as VITA 48. 2. The ARINC standard is in early stages of development and this project researches the feasibility of using air as a convective fluid instead of a liquid, the fluid used in the VITA specification. A performance factor calculated from {{the ratio of the}} heat dissipated by convective heat exchanger plates over the power used to cause forced convective flow over said plates helps to quantify the effectiveness of various cooling scenarios. Design development of the heat exchangers resulted in a plan to manufacture and test six different heat exchanger configurations. Five of these used various assortments of porous foam aluminum; the sixth used a more conventional finned design. To house and test the effectiveness of these configurations a testing platform was created to control and measure appropriate testing values. Before each configuration was tested, the setup was sealed to prevent leaks and insulated to minimize heat transfer sources beyond the effects of the controlled and measured convective air. Notable results include a 10 ppi, 8 % density porous aluminum foam heat exchanger which resulted in both the largest pressure drop, 2. 7 inches of water and heat dissipated at 301 watts at a flow rate of 72 CFM. The performance factor of this plate was the lowest at 13 [Watts/Watts]. Conversely, the largest performance factor at similar flow rate was seen in the <b>finned</b> <b>plate</b> design as 58 [Watts/Watts] at 71 CFM. However, its heat transfer for this flow rate was 167 Watts. Test results and analysis for each prototype is given within the report. A general plot of the results provides a valuable selection tool for choosing an appropriate starting design point to develop AECM air cooling for Boeing. The heat dissipation seen from the air cooled heat exchanger plates is competitive with the liquid cooled module plates and deserves further investigation. The added benefits of natural convection and the weight savings of air cooling further endorse this conclusion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{robustness}} {{of steel}} joints in fire {{is important for}} steel building structures {{because of the need}} to prevent progressive collapse. Stainless steel is widely used in building construction mainly because of its corrosion resis-tance, but it also possesses improved fire resistance com-pared with conventional non-alloy, fine grain structural steels. Extensive research performed on the robustness of steel joints in fire has revealed that failure at elevated tem-perature may be controlled by bolt shear for <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> and web cleat connections. Hence, this study focussed on the use of stainless steel in experimental tests conducted on <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> and web cleat connections at high temperatures.

40|$|Steel joints {{have always}} been {{considered}} as important parts of any structural steel building because they provide the strong links between the principal structural members. The properties and behaviour of joints in both steel and composite structures have been widely studied for some time. The focus has recently been on improving the design of structural frames {{by taking advantage of}} realistic connection moment-rotation response. This has necessitated the development of an effective and practicable methodology to describe steel connection behaviour, despite its inherent complexity. Although, the evaluation of steel connections' performance at ambient temperature has been a continuous research topic, the investigation of steel connections at elevated temperatures has only recently been tackled by researchers. However, the determination of the behaviour, available strength and stiffness of moment connections in fire conditions has been a dominant theme in these research works. Moreover, {{over a number of years}} the Component Method has been developed to describe the moment-rotation characteristics of end-plate connections, and the method is now included in Eurocode 3. To date, most of the research conducted on steel connections using the component method has focused on relatively stiff and strong connections - flush end-plates and extended end-plates. The modelling of more flexible ("pinned") connections using the Component Method has not received much attention, since the benefits arising from consideration of their behaviour in overall frame response are usually modest. However, in fire conditions connections are subject to complex force combinations of moment and tying forces, as well as vertical shear forces, and the real behaviour, even of nominally pinned connections, can have a significant effect on the overall response of the frame. To date very little information on the behaviour and the resistance of simple shear connections in fire conditions has been generated. <b>Fin</b> <b>plate</b> shear connections, which are economic to fabricate and easy to use in erection, are among these shear connections which are assumed to act as pins in normal service conditions In this research, the behaviour and robustness of simple <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> beam-to-column connections has been investigated, under the conditions of catenary tension from highly deflected beams which occurs in fire. In addition, detailed investigations have been made on applying the component method approach to this connection at both ambient and elevated temperatures. ABAQUS software has been selected to create a very detailed 3 D finite element model. This is a complex model accounting for material nonlinearity, large deformation and contact behaviour. The connection model has been analysed through the elastic and plastic ranges up to failure. Bolt shear and bending, plate and web bearing have been observed as failure modes. A comparison between available experimental data at ambient and elevated temperatures and FEA results shows that the model has a high level of accuracy. However, by implementing the FE model the opportunity was then available to explore the connection tying resistance and the application of the Component Method to the <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connection. An intensive investigation has been conducted to develop a representation of this connection type via a simplified component model, enabling prediction of the connection response at both ambient and elevated temperatures. The three main components of a fin-plate connection have been identified as plate bearing, bolt shearing and web-to-plate friction. These components have been described in detail at ambient and elevated temperatures via intensive parametric FE analyses, leading to a simplified component model of a <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connection. This model has been evaluated against FE models of complete <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> joints. Eventually, a <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> connection spring model is proposed and successfully evaluated for tying, rotation, and shear actions. The Component Model presented in this research offers an opportunity to explore complicated behaviour of <b>fin</b> <b>plate</b> shear joints, and can be incorporated into frame analysis in fire conditions.

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{study and}} optimization of combined laminar natural convection and surface radiation heat transfer in solar cavity receiver with <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> {{is presented in}} this paper. Minimizing heat loss in cavity receivers {{is seen as an}} effective way to enhance the thermal performance and the use of <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> has been proposed as a low cost means to minimize heat loss. Firstly, the influence of operating temperature, emissivity of the surface, orientation and the geometric parameters on the total heat loss from the receiver was investigated. It was observed that convective heat loss is largely affected by the angle of inclination of the receiver, the presence of fins and the number of fins in the receiver. As for the radiation heat loss it was observed that it is mainly influenced by the properties of the cavity receiver surface. The radiation heat loss was found to be constant at all the angles of the receiver. Significant reduction in natural convection heat loss from the cavity receiver was accomplished by using the <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> whereas radiation heat loss was marginally reduced by about 5 %. Secondly, the optimization was conducted to obtain the optimal fin geometry and lastly, the overall thermal efficiency of the receiver was presented at different operating temperatures. The overall cavity efficiency marginally increased by approximately 2 % with the insertion of <b>fin</b> <b>plates</b> although the convective heat loss was suppressed by about 20 %. This {{is due to the fact}} that radiation heat loss dominates at high operating temperatures compared to convective heat loss. National Research Foundation and University of Pretoria[URL]...|$|R

This paper presents a new machining method of air-cooled <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> heat sinks, namely orthogonal planing. The surface of <b>plate</b> <b>fins</b> machined by this method are rough enough to augment its specific surface area; the rough surface can also disturb laminar sub-layer of turbulent thermal boundary layer, thus the thermal resistances of thermal boundary layer are reduced.

A new pattern of chip curl that is called down-curl can be observed when rake angle of tool is rather large and cutting thickness is very thin. As cutting thickness increases, down-curl chips become flat and then up-curling. There is a transition area that chips are not curled between down- and up-curl.

This thesis on the offset strip <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> heat exchanger compares the effectiveness, overall thermal conductance & the pressure drop obtained from the experimental data with some correlations on <b>plate</b> <b>fin</b> heat exchanger i. e., Joshi-Webb correlation, Maiti-Sarangi correlation, Manglik-Bergles correlation and also with the numerically achieved data obtained by using CFD...|$|R
