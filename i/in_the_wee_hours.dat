25|$|The way to Martaban was now open. Unlike before, Laukpya had not {{opened the}} western front. But Byattaba did not panic. He {{still had the}} support of his other brothers, E Bya Bon and U-Lo, who were commanders in his army, and had {{collected}} enough men and arms. When the Martaban command heard that a Pegu army was taking a circuitous route through the woods to encircle the city from the east, the brothers planned a surprise attack outside the city. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours,</b> the Martaban army, led by the three brothers themselves, ambushed and destroyed the five vanguard regiments of the Pegu army. But the Martaban command did not know that two Pegu rearguard regiments, led by generals Smim Than-Byat and Dein, were still in the area. While the Martaban army dispersed to mop up the remaining enemies in the area, Than-Byat launched a surprise attack targeting the battalions guarding the Martaban command. It worked. Byattaba, E Bya Bon and U-Lo all fled. The remaining Martaban forces surrendered.|$|E

25|$|The Gujarat {{government}} had faced strong criticism by {{human rights groups}} for anti-Muslim human rights violations, following the communal riots of 2002. During this period, there had been several police encounter deaths in the Gujarat, three {{of which have been}} attributed to attempts to kill Narendra Modi in retaliation for the alleged involvement of the state machinery in the riots. Some human rights activists have alleged that many of these alleged encounters actually happen in police custody. They claimed that there is a pattern that many of these encounters followed: they always took place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> <b>hours</b> of the morning in a deserted area, with no witnesses; a vigorous exchange of fire resulted in the deaths of all the terrorists, while the police received no injuries; and the diary of the accused was often recovered, and contained incriminating evidence. In 2007, several of the policemen held {{responsible for the death of}} Ishrat faced trial in connection with the 2005 fake encounter of Sohrabuddin Sheikh and his wife. The police officer D.G. Vanzara, who led the encounter was later jailed for his involvement in the Sohrabuddin Sheikh fake encounter. This resulted in an investigation into the encounter involving Ishrat.|$|E

[...] Stone arranged for four remote recording trucks, two for each stage, at Woodstock '94, as a safety backup in case something went wrong. Bearsville Studios would serve as the hub of recording. Bob Clearmountain was chosen as chief audio engineer to tie the four parts together, and to mix the resulting album. Stone arranged to have a tour bus parked between the two stages for as many as 12 audio engineers to sleep.

50|$|In 1969, Sinatra's {{sales were}} low. To try to combat this, {{he agreed to}} record a concept album with Bob Gaudio and Frankie Valli of the Four Seasons and singer-songwriter Jake Holmes.

Military requirements led to a large number of special trains being run, some of them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wee</b> small <b>hours</b> of <b>the</b> morning, which led to some minor mishaps.
