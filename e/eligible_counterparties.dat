40|$|On 1 November 2007 MiFID and its {{implementing}} legislation have entered into force. A novelty {{of the new}} regime is that {{the application of the}} elaborated rules of conduct is now tailored to the category in which an investor is classified. Before the investment firm can deliver any services, it has to classify its clients in one of the three categories introduced by the MiFID: retail clients, professional clients and, as a subgroup of this last category, <b>eligible</b> <b>counterparties.</b> This article in the first place intends to give an in-depth and detailed overview of the new client classification regime: what are the criteria and procedures for clients to be categorised in one or the other category and to which extent and how can a client switch to another category than the one initially classified in? The article further gives an overview of the consequences (amongst other things, the level of investor protection) of the classification of an investor in a particular category. The new regime is finally contrasted with the manner in which in the pre-MiFID Belgian (case-) law differentiation was brought into the vast and heterogeneous group of investors. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID), was {{come into}} force in November 2007 and {{broadens}} {{the scope of}} both services and financial instruments covered previously by the Investment Services Directive (ISD). For example, the following securities were {{not covered by the}} ISD but are included in the scope of MiFID: derivatives, commodity derivatives, credit derivatives and financial contracts for differences. MiFID sets out new and tougher requirements relating to the organisation of business in regulated firms, particucarly in areas of compliance, internal audit, risk management, outsourcing, systems and control and record-keeping. MiFID sets out new policies, processes and the conduct of business rules with clients and controls around how an investment firm works on a daily basis with clients. These rules are differ depending on the classification of the clients themselves (retail client, professional client or <b>eligible</b> <b>counterparty).</b> MiFID sets out the basic information requirements and fiduciary duties of investment firms towars their customers. směrnice o trzích finančních nástrojů - nazývána MiFID, test vhodnosti, test přiměřenosti, vícestranný obchodní systém, The Markets in Financial Instruments Directive or MiFID, suitability test, appropriateness test, multilateral trading facilities...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} operational {{and financial}} implications of jet fuel risk management. The first {{element of the}} thesis use global sample of 54 airline companies from 2000 to 2012, resulting in 411 firm-year observations. The results show that hedging strategies are effective at reducing the variability of operating cash flows and capital expenditures. The results also provide evidence that jet fuel hedging is associated with lower fuel expenses {{as a percentage of}} operating expenses. Partitioning the sample into the low cost carrier and major carrier business model sub-samples, the study identifies value premium of 5 % to 8 % of the average total market value associated with hedging for low cost carriers. These results are robust to fixed effects and instrumental variable regressions and empirically support value maximization via hedging when firms have high financial distress costs and significant investment opportunities. Finally it is evidenced that government ownership reduces firm value, capital expenditures, profitability and hedging ratios. However, lower firm values observed for airline companies with government ownership is not associated with their hedging practices. The second element of the thesis conducts two case studies using the fuel consumption data of Turkish Airlines. In one of the case studies a hedging scenario using a spectrum of derivative instruments is compared to a scenario of no hedging. In the other case study a hedging scenario using a spectrum of derivative instruments is compared to the actual hedging program of Turkish Airlines. Results indicate that regardless of the derivative instruments used hedging could have saved {{hundreds of millions of dollars}} in fuel bill for Turkish Airlines. Needless to say, having saved millions in fuel costs could have significantly improved operational and financial performance of Turkish Airlines. Moreover, the results indicate that the inclusion of non-linear pay-off derivative instruments to a portfolio of linear pay-off derivative instruments significantly reduce the cash flow exposure of the combined portfolio. The third element of this thesis investigates the term, selective hedging, which is a hedging methodology that incorporates managements’ so called market knowledge and expectations. The study aims to add a third dimension, which is the choice of derivative instrument, on the selective hedging argument which is limited to the timing and the magnitude of the hedges. It is acknowledged that the choice of derivative instrument has greater cash flow implications for firms that are dependent on exchange traded derivative instruments with limited and/or no access to over the counter derivatives. These firms generally have insufficient credit rating to be <b>eligible</b> to be <b>counterparty</b> to an arm’s length trades. Commodity end-users such as airline companies constitute relatively little proportion of total oil consumption which is around the 4 % of the total world consumption (IATA, 2012). As a result, it is natural to expect the management of these firms with limited and/or no access to over the counter derivatives to take into consideration the market sentiment in their hedging decision. Using the implied volatility functions of oil options on futures traded in NYMEX, this study tests whether the implied volatility observed in oil contracts are loaded with useful information about the direction of oil prices and whether an oil risk hedger can benefit from this information, if any. The results show that the implied volatilities observed in oil markets do not provide privileged information about the direction of oil prices, at least for the short end portion of the contracts. These results might be affected by the time series properties of the observations...|$|R
