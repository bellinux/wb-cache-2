50|$|However, test-tube {{studies have}} shown that telomeres are highly {{susceptible}} to oxidative stress. There is evidence that oxidative stress-mediated DNA damage is an important determinant of telomere shortening. Telomere shortening due to free radicals explains the difference between the estimated loss per division because of the <b>end-replication</b> problem (c. 20 bp) and actual telomere shortening rates (50-100 bp), and has a greater absolute impact on telomere length than shortening caused by the <b>end-replication</b> problem. Population-based studies have also indicated an interaction between anti-oxidant intake and telomere length. In the Long Island Breast Cancer Study Project (LIBCSP), authors found a moderate increase in breast cancer risk among women with the shortest telomeres and lower dietary intake of beta carotene, vitamin C or E. These results suggest that cancer risk due to telomere shortening may interact with other mechanisms of DNA damage, specifically oxidative stress.|$|E
30|$|The {{telomere}} {{lengths and}} telomerase activity levels of ash and willow trees changed seasonally and showed a regular trend. In this study, the telomere length did not peak with telomerase activity in April. From May to August, the telomere lengths peaked and remained stable during the annual developmental cycle, whereas the telomerase activity level decreased and remained stable in ash and willow trees. In September and October, the telomere length and telomerase activity level decreased significantly (Figure  5). Thus, the telomere length and telomerase activity level in ash and willow trees during the annual developmental cycle were correlated. The model of telomere length homeostasis for the Columbia ecotype of Arabidopsis reported by Shakirov and Shippen (2004) {{may be able}} to explain the phenomenon observed in our study. They hypothesized that telomeres reach an optimal, ecotype-specific size based on the opposing consequences of telomerase activity and the <b>end-replication</b> problem. Telomerase is more likely to function when the telomere length reaches a lower threshold. As telomeres approach the optimal threshold, there is an equal chance of telomerase action or inaction, resulting in telomere splitting (middle telomere). At the maximum telomere size, telomerase is less likely to function and telomeres shorten because of the <b>end-replication</b> problem (Shakirov and Shippen 2004).|$|E

Telomere has important biological functions, it can protect chromosome from degradation and fusion and prevent the loss of terminal sequences during DNA replication (McKnight et al. 2002). A heptanucleotide telomere repeat (TTTAGGG)n, is highly conserved in plants, with the exception of Asparagales and Solanaceae species (Shakirov et al. 2008). Telomere length is maintained by telomerase, which is a specialized reverse transcriptase.

Cellular senescence, the finite replicative lifespan of cells, plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis. The biological mechanism that triggers the onset of cellular senescence is thought to be telomere shortening. The two major mechanisms responsible for telomere shortening are the <b>end-replication</b> problem, oxidative DNA damage as well as inflammation induced by environmental risk factors. Repair of the endothelium depends on the presence of endothelial progenitor cells which depends on the hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) reserves.

This study demonstrates that papaverine, an isoquinoline alkaloid from the Papaveraceae, can overcome telomerase dependent immortality of HepG- 2 cells that {{was used as a}} model of hepatocarcinoma. Although this alkaloid does not directly interact with telomeric sequences, papaverine inhibits telomerase through down-regulation of hTERT, which was analysed using thermal FRET and qRT-PCR, respectively. The IC 50 values for the reduction of both telomerase activity and hTERT expression was 60 µM, while IC 50 for cytotoxicity was 120 µM. Repeated treatments of the cells with very low non-toxic concentrations of papaverine resulted in growth arrest and strong reduction of population doublings after 40 days.

40|$|Human telomeres are {{intrinsically}} dynamic structures, {{with multiple}} biological processes operating to generate substantial length heterogeneity.

The analysis of linear mitochondrial genomes in organisms belonging todifferent phylogenetic lines indicates that their evolutionary emergence was accompanied by thegeneration of various types of terminal structures, the adaptation of existing replication machineryand by the application of different strategies of the telomere replication. This scenario is illustratedby the molecular anatomy and replication of the linear mitochondrial genome in the opportunistyeast pathogen Candida parapsilosis. Recent studies have revealed the existence of extragenomicminicircular molecules derived from the telomere repeats that seem {{to participate in the}} novelpathway of telomere maintenance.

40|$|Eukaryotic linear {{chromosomes}} face {{two problems}} that pose threats to genome integrity: (i) the end-protection problem, in which chromosome ends {{are recognized as}} double-stranded breaks by DNA damage responses, and (ii) the <b>end-replication</b> problem, in which loss of the chromosome extreme ends occurs in each cell division due to failure of DNA polymerases to replicate these termini. The shelterin complex solves both the end-protection problem and regulates access of telomerase to solve the <b>end-replication</b> problem. Decreased telomerase activity in stem cells causes dyskeratosis congenita (DC), an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome characterized by telomere lengths < 1 st percentile. Accordingly, germline mutations in telomerase subunit genes (TERC and TERT) or telomerase biogenesis genes (DKC 1, NOP 10, NHP 2, and WRAP 53) are commonly associated with DC. Mutations in telomere biology genes (TINF 2, CTC 1, and RTEL 1) are also observed in DC. In ~ 30 % of DC cases, the underlying genetic cause is unknown. TPP 1, encoded by the ACD gene, is {{a component of the}} shelterin complex. Like other shelterin proteins, TPP 1 protects the ends of chromosomes from illicit fusion events. In addition, TPP 1 is uniquely responsible for recruiting telomerase to telomeres. A group of amino acids on the surface of TPP 1, termed the TEL patch, is critical for telomerase recruitment and telomerase processivity. These functions of TPP 1 make it an excellent candidate for harboring causative mutations of DC. Here, I report the identification of a single-amino acid deletion in the TEL patch and a missense mutation in the TIN 2 -binding domain of TPP 1 in a patient suffering from a severe variant of DC, Hoyeraal-Hreidarsson syndrome. I further showed that the deletion abrogates both telomerase recruitment and enzymatic processivity, whereas the missense mutation does not {{have a significant effect on}} these functions. The missense mutation, on the other hand, inhibits the interaction between TPP 1 and TIN 2, another shelterin component responsible for recruitment of TPP 1 to telomeres. Therefore, inhibition of this interaction may exert an indirect effect on the recruitment of telomerase to telomeres due to reduced TPP 1. Thus, I propose that both the single-amino acid deletion and the missense mutation contribute to the severe phenotype of the proband...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres are the {{nucleoprotein}} {{structures that}} protect {{the ends of}} eukaryotic chromosomes from being recognized as DNA double-strand breaks. Telomeres are recognized by the ribonucleoprotein telomerase, a reverse transcriptase that catalyzes addition of G-rich telomeric DNA repeats to the 3 ? overhang of the telomere. The action of telomerase allows cells to overcome the <b>end-replication</b> problem defined by the inability of conventional DNA polymerases to fully replicate {{the end of the}} chromosome. Telomeric DNA tracts are maintained in a species-specific size range primarily through the competition between telomerase and the <b>end-replication</b> problem. In many organisms, recombinational activities can function at telomeres outside of the wild type range, in some cases resulting in telomerase-independent telomere maintenance. Telomere rapid deletion (TRD) can dramatically shorten elongated telomeres. Elongation of telomeres below the normal range in the absence of telomerase is known as alternative lengthening of telomeres (ALT). Here we demonstrate that telomeres in Arabidopsis thaliana are also subjected to these recombinational activities. Elongated telomeres in ku 70 mutants are shortened by TRD. In contrast to other organisms, TRD functions on telomeres of wild type length. TRD produces extra-chromosomal telomeric circles, which can serve as substrates for ALT. In Arabidopsis, ALT may require the byproducts of TRD, as telomerase mutants with extremely short telomeres are unable to maintain telomeric repeats by recombination and instead secure their genome through an unknown mechanism. Finally, we follow the fate of cells with telomere-to-telomere fusions. Fusions are not propagated to viable progeny. We propose that a G 1 checkpoint dependent upon the checkpoint protein ATM arrests cells following the break of a single telomere fusion. We design reporter constructs to follow the fate of individual cells with telomere fusions, and present initial characterization of their expression. We find no evidence for the propagation of telomere fusions in somatic cells, though later generation mutants will provide a better test of this hypothesis. This work begins the study of the fate of cells with telomere fusions in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, it sets the foundation for studying recombinational shortening and elongation of telomeres in Arabidopsis and the effects of these processes on telomere length regulation...|$|E
40|$|Telomere {{length is}} {{maintained}} in species-specific equilibrium primarily through a competition between telomerase-mediated elongation {{and the loss}} of terminal DNA through the <b>end-replication</b> problem. Recombinational activities are also capable of both lengthening and shortening telomeres. Here we demonstrate that elongated telomeres in Arabidopsis Ku 70 mutants reach a new length set point after three generations. Restoration of wild-type Ku 70 in these mutants leads to discrete telomere-shortening events consistent with telomere rapid deletion (TRD). These findings imply that the longer telomere length set point is achieved through competition between overactive telomerase and TRD. Surprisingly, in the absence of telomerase, a subset of elongated telomeres was further lengthened, suggesting that in this background a mechanism of telomerase-independent lengthening of telomeres operates. Unexpectedly, we also found that plants possessing wild-type-length telomeres exhibit TRD when telomerase is inactivated. TRD is stochastic, and all chromosome ends appear to be equally susceptible. The frequency of TRD decreases as telomeres shorten; telomeres less than 2 kb in length are rarely subject to TRD. We conclude that TRD functions as a potent force to regulate telomere length in Arabidopsis...|$|E

This highly sensitive PCR-based method allows telomere length measurement from as few as a single worm. The application of STELA to eight wild-type C. elegans strains revealed considerable strain-specific differences in telomere length. Within individual strains, short outlying telomeres were observed that were clearly distinct from the bulk telomere length distributions, suggesting that processes other than <b>end-replication</b> losses and telomerase-mediated lengthening may generate telomere length heterogeneity in C. elegans. The utility of this method was further demonstrated by the characterization of telomere shortening in mrt- 2 mutants.

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} nucleoprotein caps {{at the end}} {{of linear}} chromosomes, critical for genome stability. A major function of telomeres is to distinguish chromosome ends from ends of double strand breaks. A second function is to counteract incomplete <b>end-replication</b> via telomerase extension. POT 1 (Protection of Telomere 1) is a highly conserved telomere protein known for its essential role in chromosome end-protection and <b>end-replication.</b> Arabidopsis thaliana encodes three POT 1 paralogs, POT 1 a, POT 1 b, and POT 1 c. AtPOT 1 a promotes telomerase processivity and therefore is required for telomere length homeostasis. The functions of AtPOT 1 b and AtPOT 1 c are less understood. In this dissertation, I characterized the function of POT 1 b at telomeres. In contrast to POT 1 a, I found that POT 1 b is dispensable for telomere length maintenance and serves as a negative regulator of telomerase. In addition, I tested the hypothesis that TER 2 /POT 1 b works in concert with Ku to stabilize the blunt-ended telomeres. Further characterization of POT 1 b using biochemical and genetic approaches revealed several unexpected features. First, unlike POT 1 a, which is primarily localized to the nucleus, POT 1 b accumulates in the cytoplasm, where its binding partner TER 2 also resides. This observation suggests a potential regulatory pathway for TER 2 RNP via subcellular trafficking. In addition, I found that early development of POT 1 b mutants is significantly delayed, indicating that POT 1 b has a novel role in plant development. Together, these studies provide insights into the role of AtPOT 1 b in telomere biology and expand our understanding of POT 1 protein function and evolution. In addition to these studies of POT 1 proteins, I examined the role of chromosome remodeler DDM 1 (Deficient in DNA Methylation 1) in telomere length maintenance. I showed that plants deficient in DDM 1 suffer from abrupt telomere shortening in the sixth generation of the deficiency due to deletional recombination. This telomere rapid deletion (TRD) coincides with increased transposon activation and increased DNA damage sensitivity at the root apical meristem, suggesting that TRD may serve as a mechanism to stimulate programmed cell death, thereby eliminating stem cells with massive DNA damage. These studies open a new avenue for telomere function in promoting genome integrity...|$|E
40|$|No {{consensus}} exists so far on {{the definition}} of cellular senescence. The narrowest definition of senescence is irreversible growth arrest triggered by telomere shortening counting cell generations (definition 1). Other authors gave an enlarged functional definition encompassing any kind of irreversible arrest of proliferative cell types induced by damaging agents or cell cycle deregulations after overexpression of proto-oncogenes (definition 2). As stress increases, the proportion of cells in “stress-induced premature senescence-like phenotype” according to definition 1 or “stress-induced premature senescence,” according to definition 2, should increase when a culture reaches growth arrest, {{and the proportion of}} cells that reached telomere-dependent replicative senescence due to the <b>end-replication</b> problem should decrease. Stress-induced premature senescence-like phenotype and telomere-dependent replicatively senescent cells share basic similarities such as irreversible growth arrest and resistance to apoptosis, which may appear through different pathways. Irreversible growth arrest after exposure to oxidative stress and generation of DNA damage could be as efficient in avoiding immortalisation as “telomere-dependent” replicative senescence. Probabilities are higher that the senescent cells (according to definition 2) appearing in vivo are in stress-induced premature senescence rather than in telomere-dependent replicative senescence. Examples are given suggesting these cells affect in vivo tissue (patho) physiology and aging...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether the accelerated replicative senescence seen in Werner syndrome (WS) fibroblasts is due to accelerated telomere loss per cell division. Using single telomere length analysis (STELA) we show that the mean rate of telomere shortening in WS bulk cultures ranges between that of normal fibroblasts [99 bp/population doubling (PD) ] and four times that of normal (355 bp/PD). The telomere erosion rate in the fastest eroding strain slows in the later stages of culture to that observed in normal fibroblasts, and appears to be correlated with a reduction in the heterogeneity of the telomere-length distributions. Telomere erosion rates in clones of WS cells are much reduced compared with bulk cultures, as are the variances of the telomere-length distributions. The overall lack of length heterogeneity and the normal erosion rates of the clonal populations are consistent with simple <b>end-replication</b> losses as the major contributor to telomere erosion in WS cells. We propose that telomere dynamics at the single cell level in WS fibroblasts are not significantly different from those in normal fibroblasts, and suggest that the accelerated replicative decline seen in WS fibroblasts does not result from accelerated telomere erosion...|$|E

By using single-molecule approaches to characterize fusion events, we provide a functional definition of fusogenic telomeres in human cells. We show that approximately half of the fusion events contained no canonical telomere repeats at the fusion point; of those that did, the longest was 12. 8 repeats. Furthermore, in addition to <b>end-replication</b> losses, human telomeres are subjected to large-scale deletion events that occur in {{the presence or absence of}} telomerase. Here we show that these telomeres are fusogenic, and thus despite the majority of telomeres being maintained at a stable length in normal human cells, a subset of stochastically shortened telomeres can potentially cause chromosomal instability. Telomere fusion was accompanied by the deletion of one or both telomeres extending several kilobases into the telomere-adjacent DNA, and microhomology was observed at the fusion points. This contrasted with telomere fusion that was observed following the experimental disruption of TRF 2. The distinct error-prone mutational profile of fusion between critically shortened telomeres in human cells was reminiscent of Ku-independent microhomology-mediated end-joining...|$|E

Results: To measure telomeric DNA content, we counted telomeric reads containing TTAGGGx 4 or CCCTAAx 4 and normalized to the average genomic coverage. Changes in telomeric DNA content in tumor genomes were clustered using a Bayesian Information Criterion to determine loss, no change, or gain. Using this approach, we found that the pattern of telomeric DNA alteration varies dramatically across the landscape of pediatric malignancies: telomere gain was found in 32 % of solid tumors, 4 % of brain tumors and 0 % of hematopoietic malignancies. The results were validated by three independent experimental approaches and reveal significant association of telomere gain with the frequency of somatic sequence mutations and structural variations.

Growth in low oxygen and antioxidants extended the lifespan of both fetal and adult strains. As the ectopic expression of telomerase could immortalize adult lung fibroblasts cultured in ambient oxygen, the lifespan-shortening effects of 21 % oxygen {{must have been}} largely limited to telomeres. By contrast, fetal lung fibroblasts could not be immortalized in ambi-ent oxygen in spite of telomere elongation by telomerase, suggesting more widespread oxidative damage. The long-term culture requirements for the immortalization of WI- 38 fetal lung fibroblasts included supplementation with N-tert) butyl hydroxylamine, dexamethasone, zinc and vita-min B 12, in addition to growth in physiological oxygen. The mechanisms regulating telomere shortening remain controversial. The present results suggest that both <b>end-replication</b> and oxidative damage events contribute to telomere shortening in lung fibroblasts in vitro.

So far, mathematical models described telomere shortening as an autonomous process, where the loss per cell division does not depend on the telomere length itself. In this study, published measurements of telomere distributions in human fibroblasts and human endothelial cells were used to show that telomeres shorten in a length-dependent fashion. Thereafter, a mathematical model of telomere attrition was composed, in which a shortening factor and an autonomous loss were incorporated. It was assumed that the percentage of senescence was related to the percentage of telomeres below a critical length.

40|$|Cellular {{senescence}} {{triggered by}} telomere dysfunction {{has long been}} hypothesized to constitute a tumor suppression mechanism. The evidence has come primarily from in vitro cell culture studies, and more indirectly from analysis of tumor specimens. Two recent studies, published {{in the current issue}} of Cancer Cell and online at EMBO Reports, provide direct mechanistic evidence in cleverly manipulated mouse cancer models. This work shows that telomere-induced senescence is as effective as apoptosis in reducing cancer incidence and is mediated by the tumor suppressor p 53. Cellular senescence is an irreversible cell-cycle arrest that can occur in response to a variety of stresses and signaling imbalances. The first described trigger was simply ongoing cell division resulting in progressive shortening and eventual malfunction of telomeres (Hayflick, 1965). Telomeres are stretches of repetitive DNA, which together with specialized proteins form protective structures at the ends of chromosomes, preventing them from being recognized as DNA doublestrand breaks and consequently degraded or fused by DNA repair machineries. Telomeres shorten with each cell division because DNA polymerases cannot fully replicate 3 ′ termini, a phenomenon referred to as the <b>end-replication</b> problem. Telomeres are maintained by a specialized RNA-templated polymerase, called telomerase, which is composed of a catalytic protein subunit and a small template RNA (Cech, 2004).

In the present study, we further characterized BPV- 1 -positive fibroblasts derived from sarcoid tumors. The focus was on cancer-like features of sarcoid-derived fibroblasts, including cell cycle perturbation, comprehensive DNA damage analysis, <b>end-replication</b> problem, energy metabolism and oncogene-induced premature senescence. The S phase of the cell cycle, polyploidy events, DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) and DNA single strand breaks (SSBs) were increased in BPV- 1 -positive cells compared to control fibroblasts. BPV- 1 -mediated oxidative stress may contribute to telomere dysfunction in sarcoid-derived fibroblasts. Loss of mitochondrial membrane potential and concurrent elevation in intracellular ATP production may be a consequence of changes in energy-supplying pathways in BPV- 1 -positive cells which is also typical for cancer cells. Shifts in energy metabolism may support rapid proliferation in cells infected by BPV- 1. Nevertheless, sarcoid-derived fibroblasts representing a heterogeneous cell fraction vary in some aspects of metabolic phenotype due to a dual role of BPV- 1 in cell transformation and oncogene-induced premature senescence. This was shown with increased senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SA-β-gal) activity.

In order to establish if {{the dynamics of the}} XpYp telomere are typical of human telomeres, here we describe an analysis using STELA of the telomeres of 2 p, 11 q, 12 q, 17 p and XpYp. The dynamics of telomere loss (erosion rates and stochastic length changes) was conserved among 2 p, 11 q, 12 q and XpYp within the same cell strains and was dependent on the replicative kinetics of the cells in culture. However, of the telomeres analysed, the telomere of 17 p was more stable with a striking paucity of large-scale length changes, and exhibited the shortest recorded allelic distribution (300 bp) in senescent cells and displayed a general, but not absolute, trend towards being the shortest telomere. Ectopic over-expression of hTERT homogenized both allelic and chromosome-specific telomeric distributions. However, telomerase-expressing cancer cells displayed both allelic variation and chromosome-specific telomere length, with 17 p displaying the shortest allelic telomere length. Although other telomeres in the genome may share the properties of 17 p, these data suggest that physiological levels of telomerase allow differential telomere length regulation and indicate the presence of cis-acting factors that govern both telomeric stability and chromosome-specific telomere length in the presence of telomerase...|$|E

In contrast, many cancer cells and cell lines established from tumours maintain their telomere length by activation of an RNA–protein complex called telomerase, an enzyme originally discovered in Tetrahymena[5], that synthesizes telomeric repeats [6 – 8]. These findings have {{led to the formation of}} the ‘telomere hypothesis’, which proposes that critical shortening of telomeric DNA due to the <b>end-replication</b> problem [9] is the signal for the initiation of cellular senescence [10, 11]. In yeast, the EST 2 gene product, the catalytic subunit of telomerase, is essential for telomere maintenance in vivo[12 – 14]. The recent cloning of the cDNA encoding the catalytic subunit of human telomerase (hTERT) [15, 16] makes it possible to test the telomere hypothesis. In this study, we expressed hTERT in normal human diploid fibroblasts, which lack telomerase activity, to determine whether telomerase activity could be reconstituted leading to extension of replicative life span. Our results show that retroviral-mediated expression of hTERT resulted in functional telomerase activity in normal aging human cells. Moreover, reconstitution of telomerase activity in vivo led to an increase in the length of telomeric DNA and to extension of cellular life span. These findings provide direct evidence in support of the telomere hypothesis, indicating that telomere length is one factor that can determine the replicative life span of human cells...|$|E
40|$|DNA looping {{is one of}} the {{mechanisms}} involved in telomere maintenance. It probably provides a solution not only to 'the <b>end-replication</b> problem', but also for the protection of chromosomal ends against degradation enzymes and, as typical double-strand breaks, from DNA repair machinery. Telomeric loops (t-loops) formed by an invasion of protruding 3 ' overhangs into the doublestranded telomeric regions were observed in a variety of organisms ranging from ciliates to mammals. Genetic data indicate that looping also occurs at the telomeres of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, suggesting its importance for telomere function in yeast. However, several observations argue against the presence of 'true' t-loops in the budding yeast telomeres (e. g. the lack of TRF-like protein, heterogeneous telomeric sequences). Instead, telomeres in S. cerevisiae appear to form fold-back structures mediated by protein-protein interactions. To directly visualize the telomeric structure in budding yeast, we developed a system based on a mini-chromosome carrying an array of lac operator sequences allowing its purification by the lac repressor affinity column. In contrast to budding yeast, the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe contains a homologue of the human telomeric protein TRF 2, designated Taz 1 p. As the TRF 2 protein has been implicated in remodelling telomeres into t-loops, the ability of Taz 1 p to promote t-loop formation is examined by electron microscopy using purified protein and synthetic templates containing a double-stranded fission yeast telomeric tract. Our studies should shed some light not only on telomeric architecture in yeast, but should also be instrumental in deciphering detailed telomeric structure in higher eukaryotes...|$|E
40|$|Since DNA {{polymerase}} {{requires a}} labile primer to initiate unidirectional 5 '- 3 ' synthesis, some bases at the 3 ' {{end of each}} template strand are not copied unless special mechanisms bypass this "end-replication" problem. Immortal eukaryotic cells, including transformed human cells, apparently use telomerase, an enzyme that elongates telomeres, to overcome incomplete <b>end-replication.</b> However, telomerase has not been detected in normal somatic cells, and these cells lose telomeres with age. Therefore, {{to better understand the}} consequences of incomplete replication, we modeled this process for a population of dividing cells. The analysis suggests four things. First, if single-stranded overhangs generated by incomplete replication are not degraded, then mean telomere length decreases by 0. 25 of a deletion event per generation. If overhangs are degraded, the rate doubles. Data showing a decrease of about 50 base-pairs per generation in fibroblasts suggest that a full deletion event is 100 to 200 base-pairs. Second, if cells senesce after 80 doublings in vitro, mean telomere length decreases about 4000 base-pairs, but one or more telomeres in each cell will lose significantly more telomeric DNA. A checkpoint for regulation of cell growth may be signalled at that point. Third, variation in telomere length predicted by the model is consistent with the abrupt decline in dividing cells at senescence. Finally, variation in length of terminal restriction fragments is not fully explained by incomplete replication, suggesting significant interchromosomal variation in the length of telomeric or subtelomeric repeats. This analysis, together with assumptions allowing dominance of telomerase inactivation, suggests that telomere loss could explain cell cycle exit in human fibroblasts...|$|E

40|$|In cells lacking telomerase, telomeres shorten {{progressively}} {{during each}} cell division due to incomplete <b>end-replication.</b> When the telomeres become very short, cells enter {{a state that}} blocks cell division, termed senescence. A subset of these cells can overcome senescence and maintain their telomeres using telomerase-independent mechanisms. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, these cells are called ‘survivors’ and are dependent on Rad 52 -dependent homologous recombination and Pol 32 -dependent break-induced replication. There are two main types of survivors: type I and type II. The type I survivors require Rad 51 and maintain telomeres by amplification of subtelomeric elements, while the type II survivors are Rad 51 -independent, but require the MRX complex and Sgs 1 to amplify the C 1 – 3 A/TG 1 – 3 telomeric sequences. Rad 52, Pol 32, Rad 51, and Sgs 1 are also important to prevent accelerated senescence, indicating that recombination processes are important at telomeres even before the formation of survivors. The Shu complex, which consists of Shu 1, Shu 2, Psy 3, and Csm 2, promotes Rad 51 -dependent homologous recombination and has been suggested to be important for break-induced replication. It also promotes the formation of recombination intermediates that are processed by the Sgs 1 -Top 3 -Rmi 1 complex, as mutations in the SHU genes can suppress various sgs 1, top 3, and rmi 1 mutant phenotypes. Given the importance of recombination processes during senescence and survivor formation, and {{the involvement of the}} Shu complex in many of the same processes during DNA repair, we hypothesized that the Shu complex may also have functions at telomeres. Surprisingly, we find {{that this is not the}} case: the Shu complex does not affect the rate of senescence, does not influence survivor formation, and deletion of SHU 1 does not suppress the rapid senescence and type II survivor formation defect of a telomerase-negative sgs 1 mutant. Altogether, our data suggest that the Shu complex is not important for recombination processes at telomeres...|$|E

40|$|Unlike {{circular}} genomes {{in which}} the conventional replication fork machinery can accomplish the copy of the complete molecule, the requirement of a DNA/RNA molecule to prime DNA synthesis imposes replication strategies to avoid the loss of genetic information contained {{at the very end}} of the lagging strand in linear chromosomes since DNA polymerases are unable to start de novo DNA synthesis. Thus, once the most terminal primer is removed, a short region of unreplicated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) will remain at the end of the chromosome that would eventually lead to a continuous shortening of the daughter DNA molecule after successive rounds of DNA replication (the <b>end-replication</b> problem). Therefore, it is essential to guarantee replication of the chromosome ends, that otherwise would cause cell death. Organisms containing linear genomes have developed novel replication strategies to overcome such a problem by either yielding head–tail concatemers, most of them making use of terminal redundancies as phages T 4, T 7 and SPP 1, or by the circularisation and further rolling circle replication of their chromosomes, as it occurs in phage  [reviewed in (Salas & de Vega, 2008) ]. In higher eukaryotes telomerase extends directly the 3 ´ end, producing an overhanged ssDNA end (Kornberg & Baker, 1992) that finally can invade homologous double-stranded telomeric tracts, enlarging and protecting chromosome ends (Verdun & Karlseder, 2007). Other organisms, as bacteriophages, animal viruses as adenovirus and human hepatitis B virus, mitochondrial plasmids, linear chromosomes and plasmids of Streptomyces (Salas, 1999), as well as several virus infecting Archaea, as halovirus (Bamford et al., 2005; Bath et al., 2006), possess replication origins, constituted by inverted terminal repetitions (ITR) together with a terminal protein (TP), placed at both ends of their linear chromosomes (Salas, 1991). In these cases, the location of the two replication origins allows both strands to be replicated continuously, without requiring asymmetric complexes of the replicative DNA polymerase with other accessory proteins to control the different mechanics of continuous and discontinuous synthesis (Blanco et al., 1989). The TP provides the OH- group of a specific serine, threonine or tyrosine to prime initiation of DNA replication from the ends of the linear chromosome, circumventing the end replication problem, the TP remaining covalently linked to such 5 ´-termini of the genome (TP-DNA) (Salas, 1991, 1999; Salas et al., 1996).

40|$|Telomeres are {{specialized}} protein-DNA complexes that {{compose the}} natural termini of linear chromosomes. Telomeres prevent chromosome ends from deleterious degradation and fusion events and ensure the complete replication of chromosomes. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Cdc 13, Stn 1 and Ten 1 {{are essential for}} both chromosome capping and telomere length homeostasis. These three proteins have been proposed to fulfill their roles at chromosome termini as a telomere-dedicated RPA (Replication Protein A, including Rpa 70, Rpa 32 and Rpa 14) complex {{on the basis of}} several parallels with the conventional RPA. However, no direct evidence has been provided for this hypothesis. Here I provided the first direct evidence based on our crystal structures. Structural and functional analyses of Candida albicans Stn 1 -Ten 1 revealed striking similarities with Rpa 32 -Rpa 14 and critical roles for these proteins in suppressing aberrant telomerase activities at telomeres. All proved that Stn 1 -Ten 1 is an Rpa 32 -Rpa 14 -like complex at telomere. However, the relationship between Cdc 13 and Rpa 70 remained unclear. The crystal structures of multiple OB (oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide binding) -folds at the N- and C-terminal ends of Cdc 13 established an Rpa 70 -like domain organization, although the structures of Cdc 13 OB-folds are significantly different from their Rpa 70 counterparts. Furthermore, our structural and biochemical analyses revealed unexpected Cdc 13 dimerization by either N- or C-terminal OB-fold and showed that homodimerization is probably a conserved feature of all Cdc 13 s. We also uncovered the versatility of Cdc 13 dimerization in mediating interaction with different targets. The structural characterization of the interaction between the Cdc 13 N-terminal OB-fold and Pol 1, the catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α, demonstrated a role for N-terminal dimerization in Pol 1 -binding. The discovery of Candida spp. Cdc 13 dimerization through its OB 4 domain revealed its important role in high affinity telomere DNA binding. Collectively, our findings provided novel insights into the mechanisms and evolution of Cdc 13. Additionally, we have shown Cdc 13 ’s role in regulating the synthesis of telomere by interacting with telomerase subunit Est 1. The interaction involves the second OB-fold in addition to the previously recognized recruitment domain of Cdc 13. The finding significantly furthered our understandings about the synthesis of leading and lagging strands of chromosome and the essential role of Cdc 13 in solving the <b>end-replication</b> problem...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres {{protect the}} ends of {{chromosomes}} from the activity of DNA repair machinery and provide {{a solution to the}} <b>end-replication</b> problem. In humans, the core protein complex located at telomeres is known as shelterin and consists of six protein subunits. Although variation is seen in the telomeric complex between species, in fission yeast the complex has notable similarities to that of humans. Separately to shelterin, the CST complex (Cdc 13 /Stn 1 /Ten 1) is conserved in budding yeast, plants and mammals and is thought to negatively regulate telomerase, in addition to being required for telomere protection. However, unlike Stn 1 and Ten 1, Cdc 13 has not yet been identified in fission yeast. Poz 1 is a bridging molecule equivalent to TIN 2 in human shelterin, which links the Taz 1 -Rap 1 and the Pot 1 -Tpz 1 -Ccq 1 sub-complexes, respectively bound to double- and single-stranded DNA at telomeres. Poz 1 is required for the regulation of telomerase activity, and it has been hypothesised that it might do so by playing a structural role in the switching of telomeres from an open to a closed state. In this study, a reverse- 2 -hybrid approach was used to generate Poz 1 alleles unable to interact with Rap 1 or Tpz 1 specifically. These alleles were subjected to phenotypic and biochemical analysis which indicated that neither individual interaction is sufficient to maintain telomere homeostasis. With telomere lengths similar to a Poz 1 deletion, it is proposed that negative regulation cannot occur without the ability to form a closed complex. Given that Cdc 13 is currently the only missing component in fission yeast, a second study was initiated aiming to identify a homologue by yeast- 2 -hybrid screening of a cDNA library, using Stn 1 and Ten 1 as baits. However, this approach did not yield any positive candidates. In an alternative approach, Stn 1 temperature-sensitive (ts) alleles were generated and characterised. These were used to screen a genomic library for suppressors of the Stn 1 ts phenotype. Several candidates were identified that require further examination while the ts allele analysis indicated that telomeres are lost in their entirety at non-permissive temperatures and that survivors of this process did so by chromosome circularisation, similar to Pot 1 mutants...|$|E
40|$|Telomeres are {{repetitive}} TTAGGG structures ending each chromosome {{and thereby}} protecting its integrity. Due to the <b>end-replication</b> problem, telomeres shorten with each cell division. When reaching a critical telomere length (TL), the cells stop dividing and enter replicative senescence. It {{has been speculated}} that telomeres might regulate lifespan at the organism level but this hypothesis is controversial. However, telomeres in human blood cells do shorten with increasing age. Telomerase is an enzyme capable of lengthen telomeres. It consists of a catalytic subunit, hTERT, and a RNA template, hTR. Telomerase is active in germ cells, stem cells, activated lymphocytes and highly proliferating epithelial cells while no activity is found in other somatic cells. One step {{in order to produce}} a tumour mass is that cancer cells need to have a limitless replicative potential and this can be achieved by activating telomerase. Most tumour cells express telomerase activity and hence, the enzyme is an interesting target for cancer therapy. Telomere length is in part inherited. Two separate family cohorts were investigated to elucidate the inheritance pattern and a strong paternal inheritance was observed. In the larger, multifamily cohort spanning up to four generations, a weak correlation between the TL of the mother and the child was also found, as well as a significant correlation between grandparent-grandchild pairs. Interestingly, the heritable impact diminished with increasing age, indicating than non-heritable factors might influence TL during life. A functional T to C transition polymorphism in the hTERT promoter was previously reported, showing that the - 1327 C/C genotype was correlated with shorter TL compared to the alternative genotypes in healthy individuals and in coronary artery disease patients. When investigating 226 myocardial infarction patients and 444 controls separately, no differences were observed regarding mean TL or increased attrition rate between the different genotypes. TL in blood cells is shown to be altered in patients with certain types of solid tumours. In our breast cancer cohort, TL was a strong prognostic marker. Short telomeres were associated with increased survival, especially in young patients and in those with advanced tumours. It has been speculated that cancer patients might have a faster telomere attrition rate than controls but this has not been experimentally proven. Two blood samples from the same individual taken with 9 - 11 years interval was investigated. Some were diagnosed with a malignancy after the second blood draw. When comparing patients with controls, telomere attrition rate was not correlated to future tumour development. About one third of the individuals elongated their telomeres over a decade and the individual telomere attrition rate was telomere length dependent, showing an inverse correlation to TL at a highly significant level. This strongly suggests that the TL maintenance mechanism shown to provide protection for short telomeres in vitro is important also in human cells in vivo...|$|E
