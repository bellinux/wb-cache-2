25|$|In April, the Marauders {{were ordered}} by General Stilwell {{to take up}} a {{blocking}} position at Nhpum Ga and hold it against Japanese attacks, a conventional defensive action for which the unit had not been equipped. At times surrounded, the Marauders coordinated their own battalions in mutual support to break the siege after a series of fierce assaults by Japanese forces. At Nhpum Ga, the Marauders killed 400 Japanese soldiers, while suffering 57 killed in action, 302 wounded, and 379 incapacitated due to illness and exhaustion. Of the unit's 200 mules, 75 were killed by artillery and mortar fire. A concurrent outbreak of amoebic dysentery (contracted after linking up with Chinese forces) further reduced their effective strength. Although the Marauders had previously avoided losses from this deadly disease (in part by use of <b>halazone</b> tablets and strict field sanitation procedures), their encampment with Chinese infantry, who used the rivers as latrines, proved their undoing (the Chinese troops, who always boiled their drinking water, were not seriously affected).|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine-based <b>halazone</b> tablets were {{formerly}} popularly {{used for}} portable water purification. Chlorine in water {{is more than}} three times more effective as a disinfectant against Escherichia coli than iodine. <b>Halazone</b> tablets were thus commonly used during World War II by U.S. soldiers for portable water purification, even being included in accessory packs for C-rations until 1945.|$|E
5000|$|The primary {{limitation}} of <b>halazone</b> tablets {{was the very}} short usable life of opened bottles, typically 3 days or less, unlike iodine-based tablets which have a usable open bottle life of 3 months. Sodium dichloroisocyanurate (NaDCC) has largely displaced <b>halazone</b> tablets for the few remaining chlorine-based water purification tablets available today. It is compressed with effervescent salts, usually adipic acid and sodium bicarbonate, to form rapidly dissolving tablets, diluted to 10 parts per million available chlorine (ppm av.cl) when drinking water is mildly contaminated and 20ppm when visibly contaminated.|$|E
50|$|Side effects if contact occurs {{may include}} skin {{irritation}} and chemical burns to the eye. They may also cause corrosion and therefore may require being rinsed off. Specific compounds {{in this family}} include sodium hypochlorite, chloramine, <b>halazone,</b> chlorine dioxide, and sodium dichloroisocyanurate. They are effective against {{a wide variety of}} microorganisms including bacterial spores.|$|E
50|$|Breakfast Unit: canned entree veal (early version), canned chopped ham {{and eggs}} (all {{subsequent}} versions), biscuits, dextrose or malted milk tablets (early version), dried fruit bar, pre-mixed oatmeal cereal (late version) <b>Halazone</b> water purification tablets, a four-pack of cigarettes, Dentyne or Wrigley chewing gum, instant coffee, {{a packet of}} toilet paper tissues, and sugar (granulated, cubed, or compressed).|$|E
50|$|It {{is mainly}} {{used as a}} disinfectant, biocide, {{industrial}} deodorant and detergent. It is found in some modern water purification tablets/filters. It is more efficient than formerly used <b>halazone</b> water disinfectant. In these applications, it {{is a source of}} slow release of chlorine in low concentrations at a relatively constant rate. As a disinfectant, it is used to sterilize drinking water, swimming pools, tableware and air, fight against infectious diseases as routine disinfection.|$|E
5000|$|In 1945, the {{accessory}} pack was modified. Per {{the order of}} the Surgeon General, the <b>halazone</b> tablets were removed and salt tablets were added. Also, feedback from the field revealed that soldiers who smoked often opened up accessory packs just to get the cigarettes and threw away the rest of the items. To reduce waste, {{the accessory}} pack was now divided into the [...] "short" [...] pack with cigarettes and matches and the [...] "long" [...] pack containing the other accessories.|$|E
5000|$|The brown butcher paper {{accessory}} pack contained sugar tablets, <b>halazone</b> {{water purification}} tablets (for {{a brief period}} in 1945), a flat wooden spoon, a piece of candy-coated chewing gum, 3 [...] "short" [...] sample 3-packs or one [...] "long" [...] sample 9-pack of commercial-grade cigarettes and a book of 20 cardboard moisture-resistant matches, a paper-wrapped P-38 can opener printed with instructions for its proper use, and typically 22.5 sheets of toilet paper (compared to 3 sheets for the British Army). [...] The P-38 can openers were generally worn on the GI's [...] "dog tag" [...] chain to facilitate opening the next meal's cans.|$|E
5000|$|The rest of {{the meal}} came packed neatly in a waxed paper or {{laminated}} cellophane pack. The pack always contained two packages of 8 rectangular K-1 or 4 square K-2 calorie-dense cracker biscuits each, a 4-pack of commercial-grade cigarettes, and either a flat rectangular stick of chewing gum or a square piece of candy-coated gum. Special items (like matches or <b>Halazone</b> tablets) were packed in one unit but not the others due to space limitations. Late production meals added a paper-wrapped paddle-like disposable wooden spoon and used the standard P-38 can opener instead of the [...] "twist key".|$|E
5000|$|A typical menu {{included}} such canned items as butter-substitute spread, soluble coffee, pudding, meat units, jam, evaporated milk, and vegetables {{as well as}} biscuits, cereal, beverages, candy, salt, and sugar. Accessory items were cigarettes, matches, can opener, toilet paper, soap, towels, and water-purification (<b>Halazone)</b> tablets. The partial dinner unit was enclosed in a cellophane bag-in-carton for easy distribution to the individual soldier for his noontime meal. Within the unit were biscuits, a confection, beverage powder, sugar, gum, and a can opener. These items were provided {{on the theory that}} an individual [...] "snack" [...] was sufficient for midday meals, when there would be neither time nor opportunity to prepare the ration for group feeding.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine bleach tablets give a {{more stable}} {{platform}} for disinfecting the water than liquid bleach (sodium hypochlorite) as the liquid version tends to degrade with age and give unregulated results unless assays are carried outnot practical on the spot. Still, despite chlorine-based <b>halazone</b> tablets falling from favor for portable water purification, chlorine-based bleach may nonetheless safely be used for short-term emergency water disinfection. Two drops of unscented 5% bleach can be added per liter or quart of clear water, then allowed to stand covered for 30 to 60 minutes. After this treatment, the water may be left open to reduce the chlorine smell and taste. Guidelines are available online for effective emergency use of bleach to render unsafe water potable.|$|E

50|$|Survival camping {{involves}} certain {{items that}} campers are recommended {{to have with}} them in case something goes wrong {{and they need to}} be rescued. A survival kit includes mandatory items which are small and must fit in one's pocket or which otherwise could be carried on one's person. This kit is useless in these circumstances if it is kept in the backpack that is left in camp. Such a kit should include a small metal container which can be used to heat water over a campfire, a small length of duct tape which can prove useful in many situations, and an emergency space blanket. These blankets are specially designed to occupy minimal space and are perfect for making emergency shelters, keeping the camper warm. Also because of the aluminum-like color this blanket is reflective which means it can be easily seen from an aircraft. Candle stubs are good in starting a fire as well as in warming an enclosed space. One or two band-aids are mandatory in this type of camping. Any camper, and not only the survival ones, need waterproof matches or a lighter and a large safety pin or fish hook which can be used in fishing. Rubber gloves, antiseptic wipes, tinfoil, jackknife, or <b>halazone</b> tablets (which purify the water) are also to be included into a survival kit. Although these seem too many items to be carried on one person, they are in fact small, lightweight and definitely useful.|$|E
40|$|The kill of Escherichia coli within 3 min. was {{studied in}} chlorine-demand-free water using sodium hypochlorite, mono{{chloramine}}, dichloramine, <b>halazone,</b> chloramine T, cyanuric acid + sodium hypochlorite and cyanuric acid + monochloramine. The redox potential and the available chlorine were measured. The redox potential {{was found to}} be better correlated with the disinfecting property of the water than was the amount of available chlorine. For individual pure chlorine compounds, the measuring of available chlorine showed in general a somewhat better correlation with reduction of the bacteria than the redox potential showed...|$|E
40|$|Human {{carbonic}} anhydrase II (CA II), a zinc metalloenzyme, was screened against 960 structurally diverse, biologically active small molecules. The assay monitored CA II esterase activity {{against the}} substrate 4 -nitrophenyl acetate in a format allowing high-throughput screening. The assay {{proved to be}} robust and reproducible with a hit rate of ∼ 2 %. Potential hits were further characterized by determining their IC 50 and Kd values and tested for nonspecific, promiscuous inhibition. Three known sulfonamide CA inhibitors were identified: acetazolamide, methazolamide, and celecoxib. Other hits were also found, including diuretics and antibiotics not previously identified as CA inhibitors, for example, furosemide and <b>halazone.</b> These results confirm that many sulfonamide drugs have CA inhibitory properties but also that not all sulfonamides are CA inhibitors. Thus many, but not all, sulfonamide drugs appear to interact with CA II and may target other CA isozymes. The screen also yielded several novel classes of nonsulfonamide inhibitors, including merbromin, thioxolone, and tannic acid. Although these compounds may function by some nonspecific mechanism (merbromin and tannic acid), at least 1 (thiox-olone) appears to represent a genuine CA inhibitor. Thus, this study yielded a number of potentially new classes of CA inhibitors and preliminary experiments to characterize their mechanism of action. (Journal of Biomolecular Screenin...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} several {{chemical}} reagents on the sodium current was studied in voltage-clamped single nerve fibers of the frog. The oxidants <b>halazone</b> and hypochlorous acid drastically inhibited inactivation. Their effect {{was similar to}} that of chloramine T (Wang, 1984 a). The curve relating the steady-state inactivation parameter h infinity to the conditioning potential E became nonmonotonic after treatment with the oxidants, i. e., dh infinity/dE greater than 0 for E greater than - 20 mV. By contrast, the oxidants periodate, iodate, and hydrogen peroxide (applied for the same time, but at higher concentrations) merely produced a parallel shift of the h infinity(E) curve to more negative values of membrane potential. Diethylpyrocarbonate, a reagent that preferentially modifies histidine groups, had one marked effect: a strong shift of the h infinity(E) curve to more negative values of membrane potential. Almost no effect was observed after application of the tyrosine-reactive reagent N-acetylimidazole. Similarly, the arginine-reactive reagent glyoxal had only minor effects on the Na permeability. The results suggest that methionine is not critically involved in the kinetics of Na current inactivation. Similarly, an essential tyrosine or arginine residue seems to be unavailable to chemical reagents from outside on the frog node of Ranvier. Deduced from the reactivities of (some of) the reagents used, modification of membrane lipids is a tentative explanation for the effects observed on inactivation kinetics...|$|E
