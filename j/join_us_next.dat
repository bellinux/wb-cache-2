Like {{so many of the}} New Zealanders I had met before, he was a splendid young fellow; but he had been terribly gassed at the front and had been told by the doctors {{that he would not be}} fit to go back even if the war lasted another year, and we were then well through the third. The way the poison in his lungs affected him was curious. He had his bad periods when for a fortnight or so he would lie in his hospital suffering much and terribly depressed, and at such time black spots would appear all over his chest and neck and arms so that he would be spotted like a pard. Then the spots would fade and he would rise apparently well, and being of an energetic disposition, was allowed to do local war work.|$|R

Men who have some means of their own--£100 a year is enough, or even less--or some aptitude for languages, surely will feel drawn in this direction. It is the happiest life a man can lead, full of enjoyment, physical and mental, exquisite scenery, famous warm climate, lots of bathing, yams and taro and cocoa-nut enough to make an alderman's mouth water, and such loving, gentle people. But of course something depends on the way in which a man looks at these things, and a fine gentleman who can't get on without his servant, and can't put his luggage for four months into a compass of six feet by one-and-a-half, won't like it....|$|R

Wyche Fowler Jr. will join the University of Georgia School of Law as the Carl E. Sanders Political Leadership Scholar {{in the spring of}} 2008 {{teaching}} a course on the U. S. Congress and the Constitution. 2 ̆ 2 We are delighted and honored to have Senator Fowler <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>next</b> semester, 2 ̆ 2 School of Law Dean Rebecca H. White said. 2 ̆ 2 I know our students will benefit tremendously and learn a great deal from his knowledge, experience and insight, and we appreciate him taking the time to share his expertise by teaching a course in our law school. 2 ̆ 2 Named for Georgia 2 ̆ 7 s 74 th Governor and Georgia Law alumnus, Carl E. Sanders, the Sanders Chair in Political Leadership was created to give law students the opportunity to learn from individuals who have distinguished themselves in politics or other forms of public service, according to White. 2 ̆ 2 Bringing to our law school outstanding leaders such as Senator Fowler allows our students to better understand the interplay of law, politics and policy, and may inspire law students to consider a career in public service. 2 ̆ 2 Currently, Fowler is engaged in an international business and law practice and serves as chair {{of the board of the}} Middle East Institute, a nonprofit research foundation in Washington, D. C. He began his public service career as an Atlanta City Council member, while still in law school at Emory University, and was ultimately chosen to serve as city council president. In 1977, Fowler was elected to the U. S. House of Representatives. Nine years later, he was elected to the U. S. Senate where he was assistant floor leader. He was later appointed U. S. ambassador to the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. After his service as ambassador, Fowler was presented with the Federal Bureau of Investigation 2 ̆ 7 s highest civilian honor, the Jefferson Cup, for his assistance in combating terrorism and for helping to solve terrorism crimes against the U. S. military in Saudi Arabia. Other notable honors bestowed upon Fowler include being named Solar Man of the Year (twice) for his work on alternative energy development and conservation, Most Effective Legislator by the Southern Governors 2 ̆ 7 Association for work on transportation and agricultural conservation, Georgia Transportation Man of the Year and Georgia Wildlife Federation Conservationist of the Year. Additionally, he has received the Central Intelligence Agency 2 ̆ 2 Seal 2 ̆ 2 medallion for dedicated service to the intelligence community. Previous Sanders Political Leadership Scholars who have taught a course at the law school include: prominent media personality and political consultant Paul E. Begala, former Georgia Secretary of State Cathy Cox, former U. S. Department of Commerce Deputy Secretary Theodore 2 ̆ 2 Ted 2 ̆ 2 W. Kassinger, former U. S. Sen. J. Maxwell 2 ̆ 2 Max 2 ̆ 2 Cleland and former Georgia Supreme Court Justice George T. Smith. Also, former U. S. Attorney General and U. S. Court of Appeals Judge Griffin B. Bell has lectured at the law school as a Sanders Scholar. #...|$|R
