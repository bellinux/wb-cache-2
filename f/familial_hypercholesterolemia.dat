Inhibiting PCSK 9 results in improved LDLR recycling, increased LDLR availability on hepatocyte cell surfaces, and reduced blood LDL-C levels, making PCSK 9 inhibition a novel therapeutic strategy for managing hypercholesterolemia. Monoclonal antibodies directed against PCSK 9 {{have been developed}} for this purpose. A large number of clinical trials have demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies against PCSK 9 yield substantial reductions in LDL-C when administered as monotherapy or in combination with statins to patients with nonfamilial and <b>familial</b> forms of <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b> Data from long-term trials demonstrate that the LDL-C-lowering effect of PCSK 9 inhibitors is durable. These agents are generally well tolerated, and few patients discontinue treatment due to adverse events. Moreover, PCSK 9 inhibitors do not appear to elicit the hepatic and muscle-related side effects associated with statin use. The ultimate value of PCSK 9 inhibitors will be measured by their effect on clinical outcomes. Early evidence of a reduction in cardiovascular events after 1 year of treatment was shown in a prospective exploratory analysis of two ongoing long-term open-label extension evolocumab trials. Similarly, cardiovascular events were reduced in another exploratory analysis after > 1 year of therapy with alirocumab. For the primary care physician, PCSK 9 inhibitors represent a welcome additional option for lowering LDL-C in patients with <b>familial</b> forms of <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> and those with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease who are on maximally tolerated statin therapy.

40|$|Objective—We have {{reported}} further heterogeneity in <b>familial</b> autosomal-dominant <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> (FH) related to mutation in proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK 9) gene previously named neural apoptosis regulated convertase 1 (Narc- 1). Our {{aim was to}} define the metabolic bases of this new form of hypercholesterolemia. Methods and Results—In vivo kinetics of apolipoprotein B 100 -containing lipoproteins using a 14 -hour primed constant infusion of [2 H 3] leucine was conducted in 2 subjects carrying the mutation S 127 R in PCSK 9, controls subjects, and FH subjects with known mutations on the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene (LDL-R). Apo B 100 production, catabolism, and transfer rates were estimated from very LDL (VLDL), intermediate-density lipoprotein (IDL), and LDL tracer enrichments by compartmental analysis. PCSK 9 mutation dramatically increased the production rate of apolipoprotein B 100 (3 -fold) compared with controls or LDL-R mutated subjects, related to direct overproduction of VLDL (3 -fold), IDL (3 -fold), and LDL (5 -fold). The 2 subjects also showed a decrease in VLDL and IDL conversion (10 % to 30 % of the controls). LDL fractional catabolic rate was slightly decreased (by 30 %) compared with controls but still higher than LDL-R–mutated subjects.

40|$|This study {{compared}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} pravastatin and gemfibrozil {{in the treatment of}} primary hypercholesterolemia. Three hundred eighty-five outpatients from 13 lipid clinics in Italy participated in this randomized double-blind study. Patients were assigned to receive either 40 mg once daily of pravastatin or 600 mg of gemfibrozil twice daily after an initial diet lead-in period. After 24 weeks, mean reductions from baseline values of plasma total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol were, respectively, 23 % and 30 % with pravastatin and 14 % and 17 % with gemfibrozil. Significant lipid-lowering effects were noted within 4 weeks. Apolipoprotein B decrease was 21 % with pravastatin and 13 % with gemfibrozil. A statistically significant increase of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol of 5 % was achieved with pravastatin compared with a 13 % increase for gemfibrozil. Serum triglyceride values decreased 5 % with pravastatin and 37 % with gemfibrozil. Familial and polygenic hypercholesterolemic patients were also examined separately. Pravastatin effectiveness in reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol was greater by 6 % in polygenic than in familial hypercholesterolemic patients. Treatment for 25 patients (eight treated with pravastatin and 17 treated with gemfibrozil) was discontinued during the study.

25|$|Carotid IMT {{has been}} {{measured}} in numerous epidemiological and clinical studies. These have shown associations with numerous risk factors, including {{type 2 diabetes}} and impaired glucose tolerance, <b>familial</b> <b>hypercholesterolemia,</b> high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C) and triglycerides, rheumatoid arthritis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, and air pollution. Since the 1990s, some small and larger scale clinical trials of lifestyle and pharmaceutical interventions have also used carotid artery IMT as a surrogate endpoint for evaluating the regression and/or progression of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However the appropriateness of carotid IMT {{in this context is}} uncertain. Although carotid intima-media thickness is strongly associated with atherosclerosis, thickening of the intima-media may not always be due to atherosclerosis. Intima-medial thickening is a complex process, depending on a variety of factors, including local hemodynamics, blood pressure, shear stress and circumferential tensile stress. Changes in shear stress may adversely affect endothelial function and particle residence time, affecting the delivery and transport of potentially atherogenic particles into the arterial wall and consequent plaque formation. Blood pressure may affect IMT through blood vessel remodelling or wall hypertrophy in response to altered circumferential stress. Variations in IMT between different locations, such as the inflow side of branches, the inner curvature at bends and opposite the flow divider at bifurcations may reflect differences in local hemodynamic forces. However, an IMT greater than 0.9-1mm is highly likely to be indicative of atherosclerosis and increased risk of cardiovascular disease. Often, the measurement of the IMT is measured in three locations: in the common carotid (typically at one cm proximal to the flow divider), at the bifurcation, and in the internal carotid artery. IMT measurements of the far (deeper) wall, by ultrasound, are generally considered more reliable than measurements performed on the near (more superficial) wall; although measurement of both near and far wall IMT has also been advocated.|$|E

40|$|Cholesterol plays several {{structural}} and metabolic roles that are vital for human biology. It spreads {{along the entire}} plasma membrane of the cell modulating fluidity and concentrating in specialized sphingolipid-rich domains called rafts and caveolae. Cholesterol is also a substrate for steroid hormones. However, too much cholesterol can lead to pathological pictures such as atherosclerosis, which {{is a consequence of}} the accumulation of cholesterol into the cells of the artery wall. The liver is considered to be the metabolic power station of mammalians, where cholesterol homeostasis relies on an intricate network of cellular processes whose deregulations could lead to several life-threatening pathologies such as <b>familial</b> and age-related <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b> Cholesterol homeostasis maintenance is carried out by biosynthesis, via 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase (HMGR) activity; uptake, through low density lipoprotein receptors (LDLr); lipoprotein release in the blood; storage by esterification, degradation and conversion into bile acids. Both HMGR and LDLr are transcribed as a function of cellular sterol amount by a family of transcription factors called sterol regulatory element binding proteins (SREBPs) that are responsable for the maintenance of cholesterol homeostasis through an intricated mechanism of regulation. Cholesterol obtained by hepatic de novo synthesis could be esterified and incorporated into apolipoprotein B (ApoB) - 100 -containing very low density lipoproteins (VLDL), which are then secreted into the bloodstream for transport to peripheral tissues. Moreover, dietary cholesterol is transferred from the intestine to the liver by high density lipoproteins (HDLs); all HDLs particles are internalized in the liver interacting with the hepatic scavenger receptor (SR-B 1). Here we provide an updated overview on liver cholesterol metabolism regulation and deregulation and on the causes of cholesterol metabolism-related diseases. Moreover, current pharmacological treatment and novel hypocholesterolemic strategies will also be introduced...|$|R
40|$|<b>Familial</b> {{autosomal}} dominant <b>hypercholesterolemia</b> {{is associated with}} high risk for cardiovascular accidents and is related to mutations in the low density lipoprotein receptor or its ligand apolipoprotein B (apoB). Mutations in a third gene, proprotein convertase subtilisin kexin 9 (PCSK 9), were recently associated to this disease. PCSK 9 acts as a natural inhibitor of the low density lipoprotein receptor pathway, and both genes are regulated by depletion of cholesterol cell content and statins, via sterol regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP). Here we investigated the regulation of PCSK 9 gene expression during nutritional changes. We showed that PCSK 9 mRNA quantity is decreased by 73 % in mice after 24 h of fasting, leading to a 2 -fold decrease in protein level. In contrast PCSK 9 expression was restored upon high carbohydrate refeeding. PCSK 9 mRNA increased by 4 - 5 -fold in presence of insulin in rodent primary hepatocytes, whereas glucose had no effect. Moreover, insulin up-regulated hepatic PCSK 9 expression in vivo during a hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp in mice. Adenoviral mediated overexpression of a dominant or negative form of SREBP- 1 c confirmed the implication of this transcription factor in insulin-mediated stimulation of PCSK 9 expression. Liver X receptor agonist T 0901317 also regulated PCSK 9 expression via this same pathway (a 2 -fold increase in PCSK 9 mRNA of primary hepatocytes cultured for 24 h in presence of 1 mu M T 0901317). As our last investigation, we isolated PCSK 9 proximal promoter and verified the functionality of a SREBP- 1 c responsive element located from 335 bp to 355 bp upstream of the ATG.

40|$|Familial {{defective}} apolipoprotein B- 100 (FDB) {{is caused}} by a single G-to-A substitution at nucleotide 10, 708 leading to an arginine to glutamine change at amino acid 3, 500 of the apolipoprotein B- 100 and thus, a reduced binding of the apolipoprotein B to the low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor. In the present study, the prevalence of FDB in Switzerland was estimated, on the one hand, from a sample of 728 healthy volunteers whose origin was spread out over the entire German, French, and Romansh speaking parts of the country, and, on the other hand, from 142 unrelated Swiss families with primary hypercholesterolemia comprising 520 individuals. Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -based methods, three individuals were identified with the point mutation in the sample of volunteers, equivalent to a prevalence of approximately 1 / 240 (90 % confidence interval: 1. 51 x 10 - 3 - 1. 03 x 10 - 2). The frequency of FDB in the sample of hypercholesterolemic subjects was 7 / 142, yielding a prevalence of approximately 1 / 190 extrapolated to the general population (90 % confidence interval: 2. 63 x 10 - 3 - 9. 17 x 10 - 2). The combined prevalence based on both samples was 1 / 209. Thus, the investigated point mutation was highly prevalent in Switzerland and appeared to be more frequent than in other populations studied hitherto. Furthermore, the presence of the mutation was not necessarily associated with an elevation of serum cholesterol levels, particularly in young individuals. While in the non-affected volunteers cholesterol levels increased between the age of 19 and 23 years by 0. 22 mmol/l or by 5. 6 % (P = 0. 001), this phenomenon was even more pronounced in individuals with FDB. The three volunteers with the point mutation demonstrated an increase in totd cholesterol concentrations by 1. 30 mmol/l or by 25 % within 2 years, suggesting that, in the early twenties, cholesterol concentrations increase markedly from normal to elevated levels. a Considering the estimated high prevalence and the relative ease of PCR-based tests, screening for FDB may become a standard procedure in patients with suggested <b>familial</b> forms of <b>hypercholesterolemia.</b> - Miserez, A.
