5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> {{indicated}} the presence of intense convection, and the cyclone featured an axisymmetric cloud structure, with a distinct, cloud-free eye and rainbands spiraling around the disturbance as a whole. Soon thereafter, the parent low separated from the medicane entirely and continued eastward, meandering toward the Aegean Sea and Turkey. Initially remaining stationary between Greece and Sicily with a minimum atmospheric pressure of 1002mbar (29.59inHg), the newly formed system began to drift southwest-to-south in the following days, influenced by northeasterly flow incited by the initial low, now far to the east, and a high-pressure area above central and eastern Europe. The system's atmospheric pressure increased throughout 15January {{due to the fact}} it was embedded within a large-scale environment, with its rising pressure due to the general prevalence of higher air pressures throughout the region, and was not a sign of deintensification.|$|E
5|$|The {{tropical}} depression continued drifting north-northeastward, {{and failed to}} strengthen significantly. It turned to the west on December 1, due {{to the presence of}} a strong anticyclone to its north with a ridge extending westward past the International Date Line. On December 2, based on satellite estimates, the CPHC upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Paka while located about 1000km (625mi) south-southeast of Johnston Atoll. Due to the presence of <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> across the area, forecasters had difficulty at times in locating the low-level circulation. After becoming a tropical storm, Paka remained nearly stationary for about two days before resuming a slow motion to the west-southwest. It steadily intensified due to warm water temperatures, and on December 3 the storm attained winds of 105km/h (65mph). The next day, however, it encountered dry air and began weakening; by December 6, the winds had decreased to minimal tropical storm status for about 12hours. Subsequently, Paka began to re-intensify, and on December 7 the storm crossed the International Date Line into the western North Pacific Ocean with winds of 80km/h (50mph).|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} departed Monto a {{few minutes}} after 11:00 on a direct track towards Caboolture carrying the pilot and five non-paying passengers. The weather for the flight was expected to be VFR (visual flight rules) conditions with good visibility, <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> and light winds. At 13:15, the aircraft contacted air traffic control, reporting an approximate position 69km north of Caboolture and requesting assistance with navigation. Shortly after, the pilot issued a distress call as the aircraft had entered thick cloud. Controllers in Brisbane then communicated positional information to the aircraft directly and relayed via other pilots in the area due to difficulties with radio reception. A friend of one of the passengers aboard Riama {{received a phone call from}} the aircraft, reporting that they were lost in cloud and unable to maintain altitude at around 13:20. Over the next hour, witnesses in the area around the crash site reported seeing the aircraft flying in and out of cloud at low level. At 13:48, the pilot reported he had one hour of fuel remaining and the last transmission from the aircraft came at 14:04. Neither the aircraft or the pilot were equipped or certified to fly without visual reference to the ground.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} the interannual relationship among clouds, their radiative effects, and two key indices of the atmospheric circulation: the latitudinal {{positions of the}} Hadley cell edge and the midlatitude jet. From reanalysis data and satellite observations, we find a clear and consistent relationship between {{the width of the}} Hadley cell and the <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> field, statistically significant in nearly all regions and seasons. In contrast, shifts of the midlatitude jet correlate significantly with <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> shifts only in the North Atlantic region during the winter season. While in that region and season poleward <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> shifts are associated with shortwave radiative warming, over the Southern Oceans during all seasons they are associated with shortwave radiative cooling. Finally, a trend analysis reveals that poleward <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> shifts observed over the 1983 - 2009 period are more likely related to Hadley cell expansion, rather than poleward shifts of the midlatitude jets...|$|R

Differences in trends of seasonal mean effective <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> amount between situations favorable for contrails and for cirrus are analyzed in regions with high and low air traffic density. In regions with especially high air traffic density, a significantly stronger increase of effective <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> amount is found for situations with sufficiently cold and humid air masses favorable for contrails than for all situations in general or for situations favorable for cirrus.

500|$|Chinese {{painting}} {{during the}} Song dynasty reached {{a new level}} of sophistication with further development of landscape painting. The shan shui style painting—"shan" [...] meaning mountain, and [...] "shui" [...] meaning river—became prominent features in Chinese landscape art. The emphasis laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in Chinese philosophy; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos, while Neo-Confucianist writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena. The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and celadon wares with complex use of enamels was also developed further during the Song period. Longquan celadon wares were particularly popular in the Song period. Black and red lacquerwares of the Song period featured beautifully carved artwork of miniature nature scenes, landscapes, or simple decorative motifs. However, even though intricate bronze-casting, ceramics and lacquerware, jade carving, sculpture, architecture, and the painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese, landscape painting was paramount. By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged. Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground, while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space.

40|$|Diurnal moist {{convection}} is {{an important}} element of summer precipitation over Central Europe and the Alps. It is poorly represented in models using parameterized convection. In this study, we investigate the diurnal cycle of convection during 11  days in June 2007 using the COSMO model. The numerical simulations are compared with satellite measurements of GERB and SEVIRI, AVHRR satellite-based cloud properties and ground-based precipitation and temperature measurements. The simulations use horizontal resolutions of 12 [*]km (convection-parameterizing model, CPM) and 2 [*]km (convection-resolving model, CRM) and either a one-moment microphysics scheme (1 M) or a two-moment microphysics scheme (2 M). They are conducted for a computational domain that covers an extended Alpine area from Northern Italy to Northern Germany. The CPM with 1 M exhibits a significant overestimation of <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> cover. This results in a compensation effect {{in the top of the}} atmosphere energy budget due to an underestimation of outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and an overestimation of reflected solar radiation (RSR). The CRM reduces <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> cover and improves the OLR bias from a domain mean of − 20. 1 to − 2. 6 [*]W/m 2. When using 2 M with ice sedimentation in the CRM, <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> cover is further reduced. The stronger diurnal cycle of <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> cover and associated convection over the Alps, compared to less mountainous regions, is well represented by the CRM but underestimated by the CPM. Despite substantial differences in <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> cover, the use of a 2 M has no significant impact on the diurnal cycle of precipitation. Furthermore, a negative mid-level cloud bias is found for all simulations...|$|R
2500|$|Noctilucent {{clouds are}} {{the highest in the}} {{atmosphere}} and form {{near the top of the}} mesosphere at about ten times the altitude of tropospheric <b>high</b> <b>clouds.</b> From ground level, they can occasionally be seen illuminated by the sun during deep twilight. Ongoing research indicates that convective lift in the mesosphere is strong enough during the polar summer to cause adiabatic cooling of small amount of water vapour to the point of saturation. This tends to produce the coldest temperatures in the entire atmosphere just below the mesopause. These conditions result in the best environment for the formation of polar mesospheric clouds. [...] There is also evidence that smoke particles from burnt-up meteors provide much of the condensation nuclei required for the formation of noctilucent cloud.|$|E
2500|$|All cloud {{varieties}} {{fall into}} one of two main groups. [...] One group identifies the opacities of particular low and mid-level cloud structures and comprises the varieties translucidus (thin translucent), perlucidus (thick opaque with translucent or very small clear breaks), and opacus (thick opaque). [...] These varieties are always identifiable for cloud genera and species with variable opacity. [...] All three are associated with the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus. [...] However, only two varieties are seen with altostratus and stratus nebulosus whose uniform structures prevent the formation of a perlucidus variety. [...] Opacity-based varieties are not applied to <b>high</b> <b>clouds</b> because they are always translucent, {{or in the case of}} cirrus spissatus, always opaque. [...] Similarly, these varieties are also not associated with moderate and towering vertical clouds because they are always opaque.|$|E

40|$|The {{change of}} global-mean {{precipitation}} under {{global warming and}} interannual variability is predominantly controlled by the change of atmospheric longwave radiative cooling. Here we show that tightening of the ascending branch of the Hadley Circulation coupled with a decrease in tropical <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> fraction is key in modulating precipitation response to surface warming. The magnitude of <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> shrinkage is a primary contributor to the intermodel spread in the changes of tropical-mean outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) and global-mean precipitation per unit surface warming (dP/dT_s) for both interannual variability and global warming. Compared to observations, most Coupled Model Inter-comparison Project Phase 5 models underestimate the rates of interannual tropical-mean dOLR/dT_s and global-mean dP/dT_s, consistent with the muted tropical <b>high</b> <b>cloud</b> shrinkage. We find that the five models that agree with the observation-based interannual dP/dT_s all predict dP/dT_s under global warming higher than the ensemble mean dP/dT_s from the ∼ 20 models analysed in this study...|$|R

2500|$|After {{centuries of}} {{speculative}} {{theories about the}} formation and behavior of clouds, the first truly scientific studies were undertaken by Luke Howard in England and Jean-Baptiste Lamarck in France. Howard was a methodical observer with a strong grounding in the Latin language and used his background to classify the various tropospheric cloud types during 1802. He believed that the changing cloud forms in the sky could unlock the key to weather forecasting. Lamarck had worked independently on cloud classification the same year and {{had come up with}} a different naming scheme that failed to make an impression even in his home country of France because it used unusual French names for cloud types. His system of nomenclature included twelve categories of clouds, with such names as (translated from French) hazy clouds, dappled clouds and broom-like clouds. By contrast, Howard used universally accepted Latin, which caught on quickly after it was published in 1803. [...] As a sign of the popularity of the naming scheme, the German dramatist and poet Johann Wolfgang von Goethe composed four poems about clouds, dedicating them to Howard. [...] An elaboration of Howard's system was eventually formally adopted by the International Meteorological Conference in 1891. [...] This system covered only the tropospheric cloud types, but the discovery of clouds above the troposphere during the late 19th. century eventually led to the creation separate classification schemes for these very <b>high</b> <b>clouds.</b>|$|E
