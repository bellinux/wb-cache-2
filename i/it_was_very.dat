5|$|Gould {{noted that}} early Tasmanian {{settlers}} regarded the abundant green rosella highly as food, and often shot and ate it. He agreed that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> tasty after trying it himself. Many farmers saw the species as a pest of orchards, and green rosellas were shot.|$|E

25|$|The {{main problem}} with pottery <b>is</b> that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> fragile. While well-fired clay is {{virtually}} indestructible, if bumped or dropped it will shatter.

5|$|In 1940, a young Davis had {{appeared}} as a National Foundation for Infantile Paralysis volunteer in a memorable short subject shown in movie theaters to raise donations for the crusade against polio. The Crippler featured a sinister figure spreading over playgrounds and farms, laughing over its victims, until finally dispelled by the volunteer. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> effective in raising contributions.|$|E

While <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> acidic in the early years, since 1990 it has allowed the growth of {{a significant}} number of plant and insect species, as well as mallard and little grebe. The insects provide valuable food for migrating sand martins and swallows.|$|E
5000|$|Junger {{wanted to}} express the {{complexity}} of the experiences of combat for soldiers: One of the things I wanted to communicate with this film is that combat is a lot of things. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> not just one thing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> exciting for everybody. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very</b> scary for everybody. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> incredibly meaningful. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>very,</b> very sad if you stop and think about what you are doing.|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} the first to be {{released}} under the Octane Games brand. It received average reviews from critics upon release, with IGN's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> short and lacked any lasting appeal. Shortly after the game's release, an update was made available that added support for dual-monitors, support for editable key configurations, and more destructible objects to the game.|$|E

Artists such as Rihanna are held in high esteem and regarded as role models by millions of young people.|$|E

Some assimilation policies included: the ban of all books written in Danish or Norwegian, thus breaking the promise made at the Treaty of Roskilde; the use of Swedish language {{in the conduct of}} sermons; and all new priests and teachers having to come from Sweden.|$|E

5|$|Few storms formed this season, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> eventful. Twelve {{tropical}} cyclones formed {{during this}} season, of which five made landfall {{and two other}} impacted land areas. Two tropical cyclones that formed in other basins entered the eastern north Pacific Ocean. Early in the season three tropical cyclones impacted Mexico in a ten-day span, while the first cyclone of the season formed before it officially began. Hurricane Douglas was the strongest storm, reaching Category4 intensity on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale and had its beginnings in the Atlantic as Hurricane Cesar.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{the unusual}} {{placement}} of the cadenza before the recapitulation {{is reflected in the}} violin concertos of Tchaikovsky (where the cadenza is similarly placed) and Sibelius (where the cadenza serves to extend the development section). Moreover, following this concerto <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> rare for a composer to leave a cadenza unwritten for the soloist to improvise as in the days of Mozart and Beethoven. The linking of the three movements also influenced other concertos, such as Liszt's Second Piano Concerto.|$|E
5|$|Hydrus {{contains}} only faint deep-sky objects. IC 1717 was a deep-sky object {{discovered by the}} Danish astronomer John Louis Emil Dreyer in the late 19th century. The object at the coordinate Dreyer observed is no longer there, {{and is now a}} mystery. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> likely to have been a faint comet. PGC 6240, known as the White Rose Galaxy, is a giant spiral galaxy surrounded by shells resembling rose petals, located around 345 million light years from the Solar System. Unusually, it has cohorts of globular clusters of three distinct ages suggesting bouts of post-starburst formation following a merger with another galaxy. The constellation also contains a spiral galaxy, NGC 1511, which lies edge on to observers on Earth and is readily viewed in amateur telescopes.|$|E

5|$|In April 2010, Linguswamy's Paiyaa released. A romantic road-trip film, {{featuring}} a blockbuster album by Yuvan Shankar Raja, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> successful. For the first time, he enacted a character {{that lives in}} an urban area. He said that he accepted the film because he desperately wanted to play a cool dude on screen. Karthi's performances in Aayirathil Oruvan and Paiyaa earned him further nominations at the 58th Filmfare Awards South in the Best Actor category. Both films were dubbed into Telugu as Yuganiki Okkadu and Aawara, respectively, and were successful.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> {{soon after}} their arrival that they {{learned of the}} death of Paul I. Louis hoped that Paul's successor, Alexander I, would {{repudiate}} his father's banishment of the Bourbons (which he later did). Louis XVIII then intended to set off to the Kingdom of Naples. The Count of Artois asked Louis to send his son, Louis Antoine, and daughter-in-law, Marie-Thérèse, to him in Edinburgh, but they did not at this time. Artois had an allowance from King George III of Great Britain and sent some money to Louis. Louis XVIII's court in exile was being spied on by French police. The court-in-exile was being financed mainly by interest owed from Francis II on valuables his aunt, Marie Antoinette, had removed from France and had to cut its expenses significantly.|$|E
5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, {{he knew that it}} was risky to produce an acoustic based album because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> different from the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E

There was no earlier version of the structure; it consists of a platform with two levels that faces east towards the principal architecture of Group A.

5|$|Sing's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed 'The Assassin' or 'The Murderer' by his comrades. He {{reportedly}} {{acquired the}} latter nickname {{due to his}} callous attitude towards the enemy. By early September 1915, he had taken 119 kills, according to Brigadier-General Granville Ryrie, commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade. Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills, but on 23 October 1915, General William Birdwood, commander of ANZAC forces, issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills. Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall. If the first shot missed the target, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>very</b> risky {{to take a second}} shot, as this could give away the sniper team's position.|$|E
