25|$|The only {{hardware}} system that CP/M, as sold by Digital Research, would support was the Intel 8080 Development System. Manufacturers of CP/M-compatible systems customized {{portions of the}} operating system for their own combination of <b>installed</b> <b>memory,</b> disk drives, and console devices. CP/M would also run on systems based on the Zilog Z80 processor since the Z80 was compatible with 8080 code. While the Digital Research distributed core of CP/M (BDOS, CCP, core transient commands) did not use any of the Z80-specific instructions, many Z80-based systems used Z80 code in the system-specific BIOS, and many applications were dedicated to Z80-based CP/M machines.|$|E

50|$|Data to be {{manipulated}} and the instructions that manipulated them had to reside together in core memory. The amount of <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> (from 4,096 to 32,768 words) {{was a key}} limitation. Fortran provided several techniques to write large programs despite this limitation.|$|E
50|$|Some {{models of}} the Aspire One use an Intel 945GSE chipset which only {{supports}} 2 GB of RAM. <b>Installing</b> <b>memory</b> modules larger than 2 GB has caused the Aspire to fail the power-on self-test. Model 522, featuring the AMD Fusion C-50 chip, {{has been reported to}} work with 4 GB installed (although the included Windows 7 Starter edition has an artificially imposed 2 GB limit).|$|R

50|$|The Samsung NC10 uses a 1.6 GHz Intel Atom N270 {{processor}} {{running at}} FSB frequency of 533 MHz, and includes 1 GB of DDR2 800/6400 memory as standard. North bridge chipset is Intel 945GSE and south bridge is Intel ICH7-M. NC10 may {{be equipped with}} DDR2 667 or 800 MHz, but 945GSE GMCH supports DDR2 400/533 MHz only, {{so there is no}} reason to <b>install</b> <b>memory</b> faster than 533 MHz (PC2-4200). Internally, the NC10 has one slot for memory accepting memory modules up to 2 GB.|$|R
50|$|Digital scopes rely on {{effective}} use of the <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> and trigger functions: not enough memory and the user will miss the events they want to examine; if the scope has a large memory but does not trigger as desired, the user will have difficulty finding the event.|$|E
50|$|The term {{aliasing}} is {{also used}} to describe the situation where, due to either a hardware design choice or a hardware failure, {{one or more of the}} available address bits is not used in the memory selection process. This may be a design decision if there are more address bits available than are necessary to support the <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> device(s). In a failure, one or more address bits may be shorted together, or may be forced to ground (logic 0) or the supply voltage (logic 1).|$|E
50|$|The TC1100 {{allows for}} {{easy access to}} its memory, hard drive, and {{wireless}} card through screw-on covers on {{the rear of the}} screen unit. The <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> is either 256MB or 512MB and can be upgraded to 2GB. The hard drive is also easily upgradeable. Most 2.5-inch IDE hard drives are compatible with it, but the tablet only addresses up to 137GB, {{due to a lack of}} LBA48 support. A wireless card can be installed on units not shipped with one, but some of these did not have the antenna installed, either.|$|E

5000|$|Pilot Kenneth D. Bowersox, using Endeavours RCS system, {{performed}} two orbital maneuvers and boosted HST from a 321 by 317 nmi km orbit to a 321.7 by 320.9 nmi km {{circular orbit}} at 9:14 pm [...] EST. COSTAR functional tests were also completed. There was {{some concern about}} the health of the onboard HST DF-224 computer and recently <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> and co-processor when a memory dump failed. After much analysis by a team at the GSFC, it was determined that the dump failure was due to noise on the communications link between the spacecraft and the ground.|$|E
5000|$|With its proven design, the VideoTex {{terminal}} {{contains all}} the basic components for a general-purpose home computer. The internal modem was removed, and I/O ports for cassette storage, serial I/O, and joysticks were provided. An expansion connector {{was added to}} {{the right side of the}} case for future enhancements and program cartridges ("Program Paks"), and a RAM button (a sticker indicating the amount of <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> in the machine) covers the hole where the Modem's LED [...] "DATA" [...] indicator had been. On July 31, 1980, Tandy announced the TRS-80 Color Computer. Sharing the same case, keyboard, and layout as the AgVision/VideoTex terminals, at first glance it would be hard to tell the TRS-80 Color Computer from its predecessors.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{focus on}} {{techniques}} for proving behavioural equivalence between systems in Dpi, a distributed {{version of the}} picalculus in which processes may migrate between dynamically created locations, and where resource access policies are implemented by means of capability types. We devise a tractable collection of auxiliary proof methods, relying mainly {{on the use of}} bisimulations up-to β-reductions, which considerably relieve the burden of exhibiting witness bisimulations. Using such methods we model simple distributed protocols, such as crossing a firewall, a server and its clients, metaservers <b>installing</b> <b>memory</b> services, and address their correctness in a relatively simple manner. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{monitor and}} any floppy or hard disk drives are {{connected}} to the motherboard through cables connected to graphics adapter and disk controller cards, respectively, installed in expansion slots. Each expansion slot on the motherboard has a corresponding opening {{in the back of the}} computer case through which the card can expose connectors; a blank metal cover plate covers this case opening (to prevent dust and debris intrusion and control airflow) when no expansion card is <b>installed.</b> <b>Memory</b> expansion beyond the amount installable on the motherboard was also done with boards installed in expansion slots, and I/O devices such as parallel, serial, or network ports were likewise installed as individual expansion boards. For this reason, it was easy to fill the five expansion slots of the PC, or even the eight slots of the XT, even without installing any special hardware. Companies like Quadram and AST addressed this with their popular multi-I/O cards which combine several peripherals on one adapter card that uses only one slot; Quadram offered the QuadBoard and AST the SixPak.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} Macintosh II did {{not have}} a PMMU by default. It relied on the memory controller hardware to map the <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> into a contiguous address space. This hardware had the restriction that the address space dedicated to bank A must be larger than those of bank B. Though this memory controller was designed to support up to 16MB 30-pin SIMMs for up to 128MB of RAM, the original Macintosh II ROMs had problems limiting the amount of RAM that can be installed to 8MB. The Macintosh IIx ROMs that also shipped with the FDHD upgrade fixed this problem, though still do not have a 32-bit Memory Manager and cannot boot into 32-bit addressing mode under Mac OS (without the assistance of MODE32). MODE32 contained a workaround that allowed larger SIMMs to be put in Bank B with the PMMU installed. In this case, the ROMs at boot think that the computer has 8MB or less of RAM. MODE32 then reprograms the memory controller to dedicate more address space to Bank A, allowing the additional memory in Bank B to be accessed. Since this makes the physical address space discontiguous, the PMMU is then used to remap the address space into a contiguous block.|$|E

For both case studies, running the proposed algorithm on Matlab takes 1.12 s. It is expected running {{the same program}} using c/c++ will be 50 - 100 times faster, which satisfies the online application requirements.|$|E
30|$|The {{proposed}} {{model and}} algorithms (BB–BC and EP) were coded using C# programming language on a Windows 8 computer with <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM) of 4.00  GB, 1.80  GHz processor and 64 bit operating system. To demonstrate {{the applicability of}} the proposed model, datasets from Ighravwe and Oke (2014) were used and complemented with simulated data. The datasets that were simulated are technician’s reliability, earned-value, quality of workdone, availability and performance as well as the amount of rework and overtime maintenance activities. The amount planned maintenance work in Ighravwe and Oke (2014) was increased by 20  %. This enables us to generate upper bounds for the various planned maintenance activities.|$|E
40|$|Power {{consumed}} by the memory system becomes a serious issue as the size of <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> increases. With various low power modes {{that can be applied}} to each memory unit, the operating system can reduce the number of active memory units by collocating active pages onto a few memory units. This paper presents a memory management scheme based on this observation, which differs from other approaches in that all the memory space is considered while previous ones deal only with pages mapped to user address spaces. The buffer cache usually takes {{more than half of the}} total memory, and the pages access patterns are different from those made in user address spaces. Based on an analysis of buffer cache behavior and its interaction with user space our scheme achieves up to 63 % more power reduction. Migrating a page to a different memory unit increases memory latencies, but it is shown to reduce additional 4. 4 % of consumed power...|$|E
50|$|VDP RAM is {{also used}} for storing buffers for disk I/O, and {{variables}} and code for users' BASIC programs. Hence, the largest BASIC program possible is less than 16kB. BASIC is implemented on the TI-99 series using a second interpreted language called Graphics Programming Language (GPL). The GPL interpreter resides in the ROMs and takes control of the machine at power-up, and {{was very close to}} the native 9900 machine code, adding instructions to transparently access the different types of memory in the machine and perform higher level functions such as memory copy and formatted display. Users who <b>install</b> <b>memory</b> expansion still need to upgrade to the Extended BASIC cartridge to use it instead of VDP RAM.|$|R

30|$|In this study, the GAOM was {{formulated}} {{to maximize}} the annual hydropower generation for a single reservoir by proposing a new simulation approach to the reservoir operation. In order to achieve this aim, two algorithms were formulated in the GAOM independently. The first algorithm (Falg) is built according to the simulation process of reservoir operation, while the Salg improves the performance of GAOM by enhanced the simulation approach of reservoir operation. In the Falg, the population values of GA (releases to the powerhouse) that were initialized or obtained through GA operations are unchanged, whilst those releases are changed by using the Salg according to some constraints {{in order to enhance}} the GAOM. Historical monthly data of Mosul reservoir were used in the GAOM to evaluate those two algorithm for 20 scenarios (years), from October 1989 to December 2009. The optimal annual hydropower produced using these two algorithms were compared with the actual hydropower. All of this was done by running the GAOM in each year separately prior to the inclusion of Ev and Pr in the water balance equation. In the next step, the volumes of Ev and Pr were taken into consideration by using the Salg that strengthened the performance of GAOM. By using this procedure, the GAOM determined the optimal annual hydropower generation during the same 20  years mentioned previously. In this case, each optimal value was compared with its counterpart, which was identified without taking into consideration the Ev and Pr. In addition, it was compared with the observed hydropower. In this work all computations were performed using a Dell Inspiron 14 R laptop with an Intel (R) Core i 7 - 4500 U CPU @ 1.80  GHz 1.80  GHz, <b>installed</b> <b>memory</b> (RAM) of 8.00  GB, Windows 7 (64 -bit) operating system, and Matlab 2013 b environment.|$|E
50|$|Motherboards {{supporting}} dual-channel memory layouts {{typically have}} color-coded DIMM sockets. Coloring schemes are not standardized and have opposing meanings, {{depending on the}} motherboard manufacturer's intentions and actual motherboard design. Matching colors may either indicate that the sockets {{belong to the same}} channel (meaning that DIMM pairs should be installed to differently colored sockets), or they may be used to indicate that DIMM pairs should be installed to the same color (meaning that each socket of the same color belongs to a different channel). The motherboard's manual will provide an explanation of how to <b>install</b> <b>memory</b> for that particular unit. A matched pair of memory modules may usually be placed in the first bank of each channel, and a different-capacity pair of modules in the second bank.|$|R
