40|$|The role of {{processing}} by machining is to generate surfaces {{that have to}} meet the requirements imposed by the designer through the <b>execution</b> <b>drawing</b> of the piece. The study aims to analyze how the functional geometry of the tool evolves when lathing with a transverse advance. The technological process of lathing with transverse advance is realized with a variable machining speed, and this also causes a variation of the functional geomtry of the tool. Thus, in the paper was established the optimal construction geometry of a lathe knife {{that can be used for}} lathing a piece of a certain diameter. Under these conditions, a correlation was established between the values of the geometrical constructive parameters of the knife used for the transverse lathing and the diameter of the workpiece which can be processed in optimal condition...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} paper exemplifies a novel information integrated design technique developed at ONL (Oosterhuis and Lenard), Netherlands, specifically appropriated for envisaging complex geometric forms. The “informed design technique”, {{apart from being}} highly instrumental in conceptualizing and generating the geometric component constituting architectural form in a parametric manner, is also efficiently utilized for precise computer aided manufacturing and construction of the speculated form. Geometric complexities inherent in contemporary architectural constructs and the time spent in appropriation of such topologies, fueled the “informed design” approach, which caters to issues of timely construction, precision oriented design and production (visual and material) and parametric modelling attuned to budgetary fluctuations. This design-research approach has been tested and deployed by ONL, for conceiving “the Acoustic Barrieri project, Utrecht Leidsche Rijn in the Netherlands and is treated as a generic case for exemplifying the “informed design” technique in this {{research paper}}. The design methodology encourages visualizing architectural substantiations from a systems perspective and envisages upon a rule based adaptive systems approach involving extrapolation of contextual dynamics/ground data in terms of logical “rules”. These rules/conditionalities {{form the basis for}} spawning parametric logistics to be mapped upon geometric counterparts exemplifying the conception.   The simulated parametric relations bind dimensional aspects (length, width, height etc.) of the geometric construct in a relational manner, eventually culminating in a 3 D spatial envelope. This evolved envelope is subsequently intersected with a “parametric spatio-constructive grid”, creating specific intersecting points between the two. The hence extorted “point cloud” configuration serves as a generic information field concerning highly specific coordinates, parameters and values for each individual point/constructive node it embodies. The relations between these points are directly linked with precise displacements of structural profiles and related scaling factors of cladding materials. Parallel to this object oriented modelling approach, a detailed database (soft/information component) is also maintained to administer the relations between the obtained points. To be able to derive constructible structural and cladding components from the point cloud configuration customized Scripts (combination of Lisp and Max scripts) process the point cloud database. The programmed script-routines, iteratively run calculations to generate steel-wire frames, steel lattice-structure and cladding panels along with their dimensions and <b>execution</b> <b>drawing</b> data. Optimization-routines are also programmed to make rectifications and small adjustments in the calculated data. This precise information is further communicated with CNC milling machines to manifest complex sectional profiles formulating the construct hence enabling timely and effective construction of the conceptualized form...|$|E

40|$|The neural {{simulation}} theory {{assumes that}} motor imagery and motor <b>execution</b> <b>draw</b> on a shared set of mechanisms underlying motor cognition. Evidence is accumulating that motor imagery and motor execution have many common features. The {{extent of the}} similarity and whether it spreads into the preparation phase is however unclear. This study used electroencephalographic recordings to compare the effects of providing advance information about upcoming movements on preparatory processing in a motor imagery and execution paradigm. Event-related potential data were recorded in a priming task where participants were cued to perform simple or complex finger movements. We hypothesized that {{a high degree of}} functional similarity of motor imagery and motor execution should be reflected in similar alterations of lateralized preparatory activity. Lateralized preparatory activity was indeed very similar, showing both motor-related (lateralized readiness potential, LRP) and cognitive components (anterior directing-attention negativity or ADAN, late directing-attention positivity or LDAP). Dipole analysis revealed that LRP, ADAN, and LDAP sources were very comparable for motor imagination and execution. Results generally support the idea of common underlying functional networks subserving both the preparation for execution and imagery of movements. They also provide a broader context for this notion by revealing similarities in cognitive components associated with the movement tasks. Hum Brain Mapp 00 : 000 – 000, 2009.

40|$|Summary Despite {{being more}} common than innovation, {{little is known about}} the {{strategies}} involved in imitative market entries and the capabilities enabling their <b>executions.</b> <b>Drawing</b> on the Resource-based View and Competitive Dynamics perspectives, the study examines the role of marketing capability, technological capability and absorptive capacity in aiding technological firms to engage in successful imitative market entries. The research also examines the relationship between strategic types and resources as well as the relationship between resources and capabilities. Finally, the research investigates the role of capabilities as determinants of entry timing, relative product advantage and relative price, which in turn influence product performance. The research provides important managerial and theoretical implications. First, the integration of the RBV and Competitive Dynamics perspectives provides a richer explanation of the heterogeneity in firms’ performance. Second, the findings show that firms’ strategic orientation determines the level of marketing and R&D resources. Third, the interaction between technological capability and marketing capability accelerates imitative market entry. Fourth, technological and marketing capabilities have a U-shaped relationship with market entry. Finally, the present study found marginal support for the prediction that entry timing, relative product advantage and relative price increase the likelihood of product survival. The U-shaped relationship observed between technological and marketing capabilities with market entry illustrate the double-edged sword nature of capabilities. Although strong technological and marketing capabilities facilitate firms’ swift entry into the market for some, for others they may cause them to be trapped in existing product, lock them in with existing customers and prevent them from being receptive to the new opportunities in the environment. Finally, because marketing and technological capability interaction is significantly related to earlier entry and earlier entry is associated with a higher product survival rate, managers considering an imitative market entry need to invest in the development of these two capabilities.
