5000|$|During the 20th century, <b>expanded</b> <b>contact</b> {{with the}} outside world has led to a {{considerable}} diversification of Bermuda's architecture, more so with commercial developments than residential, to the detriment of traditional styles. Concern for the loss of Bermudian identity led to the 1937 creation of the Bermuda Historical Monuments Trust, predecessor to the present-day Bermuda National Trust, to purchase and preserve important examples of indigenous architecture. [...] Initially, though, earlier styles made a resurgence, as did the Colonial Spanish arch. [...] The Edwardian period saw the introduction of hybrid British-American bungalows marketed to the middle class; features included exposed eaves, windows gathered together and low roofs that were extended to cover porches.|$|E

However, Count Radslav Kinsky remained in Chlumec until 1953 and when he returned in 1989 to reclaim his property, he helped found a club called [...] "Equus Kinsky" [...] to protect the remaining herd of Kinsky horses and eventually resurrect the breed.

40|$|The Harbormaster Command and Control Center (HCCC) project {{provides}} mobile platforms {{intended to}} control harbor operations. The main {{component of the}} HCCC is a double-expandable shelter mounted on a 5 ton military flatbed truck. Kentucky Trailer Corporation manufactured a baseline shelter using standard materials (aluminum, steel, plywood, etc.) and also considered alternate designs using composite materials (carbon fiber laminates, glass fiber laminates, composite sandwich configurations, etc.). Two faculty members and several graduate students in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Louisville participated in this effort, primarily in terms of material selection, structural analysis, and design approaches. This thesis presents one portion of that work. This consists of a finite element model (FEM) of the HCCC using standard materials. This model was constructed to match the design proposed and later built and delivered by Kentucky Trailer. The thesis also presents two structural analysis simulations performed using the HCCC FEM. The HCCC FEM was built using ANSY Mechanical APDL. This software utilizes text-based “input files” to build, analyze and post-process the HCCC FEM entirely without user assistance. The author generated these input files to create the HCCC FEM structure using 3 D beam elements, layered shell elements, and point mass elements. This approach represented a simplification to {{eliminate the need for}} more computationally intensive 3 D solid elements; it also provides a simpler approach for changing the model as design changes occur. For example, the thickness of an aluminum plate in the HCCC FEM model is represented as a number that can be easily changed; for a 3 D solid element model, revisions would involve changing solid model entities such as volumes and areas followed by remeshing. This is feasible in a small model but impractical in a large complex model such as the HCCC FEM. The HCCC FEM is constructed in a modular manner, with different models representing the roof, sides, rear and front, floor and both expandable sections. These various submodels are joined together using constraint equations to cause identical displacements and rotations along common boundaries between models. This also permitted scenarios such as analysis with the expandables retracted or <b>expanded.</b> <b>Contact</b> elements are used to simulate support of the HCCC FEM along is bottom by a rigid boundary simulating the truck bed carrying the HCCC. The HCCC FEM is a nonlinear model due to both the contact elements and the ability to solve in cases of arbitrarily large displacement needed for dynamic analysis. Two analyses using the HCCC FEM are presented. The first is a static analysis under various constant inertial (acceleration) loads to demonstrate that the structure is worthy for air transport using a C- 17 aircraft. The second is a dynamic analysis simulating the structural response during a rail impact; this occurs when the HCCC is mounted on a rail car which then collides with another rail car. Both analyses were beneficial in demonstrating that the HCCC design performs sufficiently well in service...|$|E

40|$|Spatiotemporal {{coordination}} of cell–cell adhesion involving lamellipodial interactions, cadherin engagement, and the lateral {{expansion of the}} contact is poorly understood. Using high-resolution live-cell imaging, biosensors, and small molecule inhibitors, we investigate how Rac 1 and RhoA regulate actin dynamics during de novo contact formation between pairs of epithelial cells. Active Rac 1, the Arp 2 / 3 complex, and lamellipodia are initially localized to de novo contacts but rapidly diminish as E-cadherin accumulates; further rounds of activation and down-regulation of Rac 1 and Arp 2 / 3 occur at the contacting membrane periphery, and this cycle repeats as a restricted membrane zone that moves outward with the <b>expanding</b> <b>contact.</b> The cortical bundle of actin filaments dissolves beneath the <b>expanding</b> <b>contacts,</b> leaving actin bundles at the contact edges. RhoA and actomyosin contractility are activated at the contact edges and are required to drive expansion and completion of cell–cell adhesion. We show that zones of Rac 1 and lamellipodia activity and of RhoA and actomyosin contractility are restricted to the periphery of contacting membranes and together drive initiation, expansion, and completion of cell–cell adhesion...|$|R
