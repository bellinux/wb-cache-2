2500|$|Court {{decisions}} on the issues debated by Berardinelli and Allstate have gone both ways. According to the Business Week article, as of 2006, [...] "Courts and regulators {{in a number of}} states, including New York, Pennsylvania, and Washington, have forced Allstate to halt or change its practice of handing out a controversial 'Do <b>I</b> <b>Need</b> <b>an</b> Attorney?' form to people involved in accidents." [...] On the other hand, the article also states that [...] "Although plaintiffs have had piecemeal success in bad-faith cases against Allstate, the insurer points to seven court rulings that have rejected attacks on CCPR. Last December a Montana state court noted that while CCPR practices may be illegal 'if misapplied in a particular case, they nevertheless are neutral with no manifestly illegal purpose.'" [...] While many of the cost-reduction strategies McKinsey recommended at Allstate remain in place, some have been reined in following legal and regulatory challenges in several states.|$|E
