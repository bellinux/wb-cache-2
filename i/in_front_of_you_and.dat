500|$|At Wimbledon, Raonic {{was again}} seeded eighth. He {{defeated}} Matthew Ebden, Jack Sock, Łukasz Kubot, Nishikori, and Kyrgios {{to reach his}} first major semifinal. He became the first Canadian men's singles player to reach the semifinals at a major since Robert Powell in 1908. [...] In the quarterfinal victory against Kyrgios, Raonic tied a career-high with 39 aces. In the semifinals, Raonic lost to Federer in straight sets. After the match, Raonic reflected: [...] "There's {{a lot of good}} things to take from it. ... But when you get here to this point, I think it's just human nature, the greed of human nature, that you want so much more. [...] You feel it <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> you want to grab it." [...] Despite the loss, Raonic saw his world ranking improve to a career-high No. 6.|$|E

In an interview Sackheim commented on the Jon and Sansa reunion stating [...] "Sometimes as a director, you're just looking at what's <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you,</b> <b>and</b> not {{taking into account the}} bigger picture and the epic nature of two siblings who have been separated for six seasons — and have never had scenes together, and were both really looking forward to it — reuniting. The only note I gave them during the scene was, [...] "Hold yourself back. As much as it's joyous to see each other, you're equally as scared. You don't know what to expect." [...] The operative word was fear. Fear of the unknown. In a way, it added to the emotional resonance of the scene." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "We started class, {{and in the}} Groundlings curriculum, one of {{the first}} {{exercises}} you do is the cliched 'trust' game. I made everyone stand in a circle, with me in the center, and I said, being onstage, you have to trust your fellow actors, especially when you're an improviser. You're {{going to be there for}} each other, and they're going to be there for you. For example, I'm going to fall back, knowing that you'll catch me. Then I let myself fall backward, and sure enough, I was caught. Everyone gets out some nervous laughter, and then they all took turns doing it. By the time it got around to Mariska Hargitay, we'd already done it with ten or eleven students, and they had clearly gotten the point. Then it was Mariska's turn. 'Okay, Mariska, cross your arms <b>in</b> <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>you</b> <b>and</b> gently fall back,' I said. She fell back and nobody caught her. She fell flat on her ass. I was horrified. This had never happened in one of my classes before." ...|$|E
