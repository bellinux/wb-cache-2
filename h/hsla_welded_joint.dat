The discussion {{of the influence of}} PWHT on the residual stress in the under-matching <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> is based on the experimental verification. The results show that PWHT can reduce the residual stress in the under-matching <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> significantly, especially the lower transverse stress than the longitudinal stress.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{differences}} in mechanical properties amongst different welded joints’ regions obviously affect the strain distribution around the crack tip during the fracture test and, hence, influence the toughness value. The strength mis-match and width of <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> {{have an effect}} on the stress-strain distribution in the vicinity of the crack tip. Both can contribute to a higher constraint in the weld metal. It was found that the width of the <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> as constraint parameter has an effect on the limit load, maximum load and achieved fracture toughness values of a <b>welded</b> <b>joint.</b> In the case of strength overmatched <b>welded</b> <b>joints,</b> the limit and maximum loads increase with constraint (<b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> width) decrease. On the contrary, in the case of strength under-match <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> the limit and maximum loads decrease and the constraint (<b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> width) decreases...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. During {{welding process}} to make joints, {{residual}} stress is inevitably produced and weld metal should be used. These influence the static and dynamic behavior of steel structures with <b>welded</b> <b>joints,</b> such as steel piles. In steel structures, dynamic mechanical behavior is different to static mechanical behavior. Therefore, to accurately predict {{the behavior of}} steel piles with a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> under static-dynamic loading, the research on influence of a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> on the static and dynamic behavior of steel piles is necessary. For that purpose, a rate-dependent plasticity model was used, considering strain rate hardening and temperature rise. In this paper, the distribution of welding residual stress in a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> was computed by using three-dimensional heat conduction analysis and three-dimensional thermal elastic-plastic analysis. The behavior of steel piles with a <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> under axial static and dynamic loading was investigated by using three-dimensional elastic-plastic finite element analysis, which employed a rate-dependent plasticity model and included residual stress and mechanical properties of weld metal in a <b>welded</b> <b>joint.</b> The rate-dependent plasticity model used in this paper is proposed by the authors based on the static-dynamic loading tests.

Yield strength of <b>weld</b> <b>joint</b> {{was higher than}} that of base metal but elongation of <b>weld</b> <b>joint</b> was lower than that of base metal. UTS of <b>weld</b> <b>joint</b> was slightly lower than that of base metal. Yield strength and elongation with welding method were almost same. Fatigue life of <b>weld</b> <b>joint</b> was lower than that of base metal but fatigue strength of <b>weld</b> <b>joint</b> was {{higher than that of}} base metal. Ferrite content was increased with welding. Fatigue life welded by GTAWN was better than that of GTAW at RT and 600 ℃. This fatigue life behavior was consistent with the behavior of ferrite content...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. By {{method of}} TIG, and under certain welding craft conditions, 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti and 2 Cr 13 were welded. By (ZEISS) OM,SEM,the {{microstructure}} of {{two kinds of}} 2 Cr 13 and 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti <b>welding</b> <b>joints</b> were observed and analyzed, Through seawater immersion test, polarization curves and AC impedance spectroscopy of 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti and 2 Cr 13 <b>welding</b> <b>joints</b> were obtained. The results show that 2 Cr 13 and 1 Cr 18 Ni 9 Ti <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> is typical columnar crystal, the microstructure is lath martensite + austenite + carbide; polarization curves and AC impedance spectroscopy show that corrosion resistance of <b>welding</b> <b>joint</b> from strong to weak is: austenite base metal>HAZ near austenite>welded joint>HAZ near martensite>martensite base metal; corrosion resistance of <b>welded</b> <b>joint</b> is between martensite base metal and austenite base metal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Mesh-insensitive {{structural}} stress {{approach is a}} robust method for fatigue characteristic analysis of welded structures and has been validated in correlating {{a large amount of}} published fatigue test of steel <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> in the literature. Regarding Titanium <b>welded</b> <b>joints,</b> the combination of stress states and geometric shape can also lead to stress concentration that can result in fatigue crack initiation around the <b>welded</b> <b>joints.</b> This paper aims to analyze well-documented fatigue data of transverse and longitudinal fillet <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> of Titanium using mesh-insensitive {{structural stress}} approach. This study is the first time using the approach for titanium fatigue data analysis. The results show that the employed method can correlate fatigue data of Titanium <b>welded</b> <b>joints</b> noticeably and make sense to understand the effect of thickness on fatigue life of the joints better than conventional methods...|$|R
