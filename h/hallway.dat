5|$|The {{long take}} video begins with many people dancing on a <b>hallway,</b> until a girl comes and opens a door {{which leads to}} a room. There, other dancers are dancing to the song in midway of white rays of light, until the camera shows Jackson {{in the corner of the}} room and they start {{performing}} a dance routine. While the singer disappears from vision, people dance until she appears again dancing to the song. Then she goes to a <b>hallway</b> and enters a red-lighted room, accompanied by dancers, where entertainer Mimi Marks is seen. There she dances another routine along with her dancers. After dancing, she enters in another <b>hallway</b> where she gets alone with a man, until they share a kiss. Then, people who were in the previous room enter to the <b>hallway</b> to connect to another room, with Marks taking Jackson with her. The video ends with people coming closer to Jackson.|$|E
50|$|Although {{this central}} <b>hallways</b> is suggestive of the English central <b>hallways</b> of Pennsylvania's Georgian houses, this <b>hallway's</b> DNA is more Germanic than British. Architecture historians {{describe}} these houses as durchgaengiges Haus (through-passage house). This floorplan has {{deep roots in}} Germany's rural architecture. Prototypes for Pennsylvania's durchgaengiges floorplans are illustrated in German books {{as early as the}} 17th century.|$|R
50|$|The mosque had two <b>hallways</b> that {{surround}} the main hall, one from the east and another from the north, with an area of 800m² each. 26 domes are built {{on top of the}} <b>hallways,</b> based on 12 pillars. Between every one of them 4.5m. There are three doors for the <b>hallways,</b> one {{from the side of the}} residential area and two from the side of the markets.|$|R

5|$|Three {{weeks of}} filming were {{spent in the}} Hotel Earle, a set created by art {{director}} Dennis Gassner. The film's climax required a huge spreading fire in the hotel's <b>hallway,</b> which the Coens originally planned to add digitally in post-production. When they decided to use real flames, however, the crew built a large alternate set in an abandoned aircraft hangar at Long Beach. A series of gas jets were installed behind the <b>hallway,</b> and the wallpaper was perforated for easy penetration. As Goodman ran through the <b>hallway,</b> a man on an overhead catwalk opened each jet, giving {{the impression of a}} fire racing ahead of Charlie. Each take required a rebuild of the apparatus, and a second <b>hallway</b> (sans fire) stood ready nearby for filming pick-up shots between takes. The final scene was shot near Zuma Beach, as was the image of a wave crashing against a rock.|$|E
5|$|An {{accompanying}} music video, {{directed by}} Paul Boyd, depicts Twain {{walking down a}} <b>hallway</b> alone in a beautiful dress, and then {{toward the end of}} the video, she appears with a symphony orchestra to perform the remainder of the song.|$|E
5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One <b>hallway</b> completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble of the <b>hallway</b> known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there for an early dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E
50|$|In 2004, {{the school}} {{underwent}} additional construction to alleviate crowded <b>hallways</b> and rebuild deteriorating {{parts of the}} building. The reconstruction included a new 5 million dollar library, extended cafeteria, and connected <b>hallways</b> greatly opening up the campus and improving the flow of traffic.|$|R
50|$|Much of {{the school}} is made of {{concrete}} with fake brick layers. Only a few buildings — such as the science and P.E. buildings — are completely indoors. The main building has open <b>hallways.</b> Most <b>hallways</b> and many classroom have views of the Bay.|$|R
5000|$|The {{school day}} at Hardaway runs from 8:10 am to 3:25 pm, Monday through Friday. Lunch {{is divided into}} five {{segments}} of twenty-five minutes each. Hardaway has two long [...] "one-way" [...] <b>hallways.</b> All of the shorter <b>hallways</b> can be traveled in either direction.|$|R

5|$|A book {{published}} in November 2011, Seal Target Geronimo, by Chuck Pfarrer, a former SEAL, contradicted the account {{as given by}} U.S. government sources. According to Pfarrer, neither helicopter crashed {{at the beginning of}} the raid. Instead, the SEALs jumped onto the roof from the hovering Razor 1 helicopter and entered a third-floor <b>hallway</b> from the roof terrace. Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the <b>hallway,</b> headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her. Osama bin Laden stuck his head out of a bedroom door, saw the SEALs, and slammed the door closed. At the same time, Osama's son Khalid bin Laden ran up the stairs to the third floor and was killed with two shots.|$|E
5|$|After apologizing to Emma and {{presenting}} her with flowers, Will sees a depressed-looking Quinn (Dianna Agron) in the <b>hallway</b> and realizes {{that she is}} responsible for the list. He confronts Quinn, who confesses. To prevent her from being suspended, Will lies to Figgins that no culprit has been found, but convinces him that as no new lists have been posted, the matter should be dropped.|$|E
50|$|Discovered by {{coincidence}} during excavation {{works for a}} building construction in 1988, -to some sources in 1998- the underground city at Aydıntepe features chambers, halls and <b>hallways</b> carved out of volcanic tufa rock formation without using building materials. It is situated 2 - 5 m under the surface. The chambers and the halls are connected with 1 m-wide and 2 m-high <b>hallways</b> stretching over about 1 km in length. There are eight conical shafts over the <b>hallways,</b> which {{are believed to be}} for observation or ventilation purposes.|$|R
5000|$|Sun tunnels (“sun pipes”) {{located in}} the <b>hallways</b> {{in the north and}} south wings of the building, bring natural {{daylight}} from the rooftops into interior <b>hallways,</b> enhancing natural lighting and reducing electricity use. The electrical lights in these spaces contain sensors minimizing power use during daylight hours.|$|R

5|$|Fildes' children's {{bedrooms}} {{were hung}} with wallpapers designed by Morris & Co. and Walter Crane. Under Fildes' the <b>hallway</b> was encrusted with crimson and gold, and after passing through crimson curtains a visitor ascended stairs lined with brass plates, paintings from the Italian Renaissance and tapestries.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} morning of February 25, 1990, Terri Schiavo {{collapsed}} in a <b>hallway</b> of her St. Petersburg, Florida apartment. Firefighters and paramedics, arriving in response to her husband Michael's 9-1-1 call, found her face-down and unconscious. She was not breathing and had no pulse. They attempted to resuscitate {{her and she was}} transported to the Humana Northside Hospital. Paramedics had her intubated and ventilated.|$|E
5|$|On 27 February 1939 the {{new owner}} of the rectory, Captain W. H. Gregson, was {{unpacking}} boxes and accidentally knocked over an oil lamp in the <b>hallway.</b> The fire quickly spread {{and the house was}} severely damaged. After investigating the cause of the blaze the insurance company concluded that the fire had been started deliberately.|$|E
5000|$|These mirrors {{are often}} found in the <b>hallways</b> of various {{buildings}} (commonly known as [...] "hallway safety mirrors"), including hospitals, hotels, schools, stores, and apartment buildings. They are usually {{mounted on a wall}} or ceiling where <b>hallways</b> intersect each other, or where they make sharp turns. They are useful for people accessing the <b>hallways,</b> especially at locations having blind spots or where visibility may be limited. They are also used on roads, driveways, and alleys to provide safety for motorists where {{there is a lack of}} visibility, especially at curves and turns.|$|R

5|$|P.T. {{centers on}} an unnamed protagonist who awakens in a concrete-lined room, and opens {{a door to}} a haunted corridor, in which he can only walk through a <b>hallway</b> which {{continuously}} loops and redecorates itself. The first time he passes, a radio reports on a familicide, which was committed by the father, and later mentions two other cases exactly like it.|$|E
5|$|The lack {{of skilled}} craftspeople in Northumberland made the {{construction}} of the house difficult. For example, Richardson speculates that the main staircase was assembled from a kit. It is one step too short for the Northumberland <b>hallway,</b> but no extra step was added to finish off the symmetry of the stairwell, suggesting a dearth of skilled labor.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they fail}} to win the competition, a YouTube video of their {{performance}} gains the band popularity at school. David Bowie (portraying himself) sees the video and sends an e-mail to Will, explaining that he is starting an indie music label and is interested in having the band {{as one of their}} first artists. Will is so excited and overwhelmed that he falls {{down in the middle of}} the school <b>hallway</b> (close to the same position as the front cover of Bowie's Lodger album). The last scene takes place during Charlotte's graduation ceremony where Will and Sa5m are confirmed as dating.|$|E

An angry Borat accidentally reveals his real motive for {{traveling}} to California. Azamat becomes livid at Borat's deception, and the situation escalates into a fully nude brawl with homoerotic undertones, which spills out into the <b>hallway,</b> a crowded elevator, and ultimately into a packed convention ballroom. The two are finally separated by security guards.|$|E
5|$|At {{ground level}} {{and inside the}} lobby, bas-reliefs depict {{the origins of the}} Price company. During the 1920s John M. Lyle, an {{influential}} architect of the Beaux-arts school, was developing a uniquely Canadian fusion of French and English colonial styles, and his ideas were applied by designers Ross and Macdonald to the construction of the Price Building. Each floor is symmetrically divided in two by a <b>hallway,</b> and a projection {{at the end of the}} building references the bow of a ship.|$|E
5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the <b>hallway.</b> In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, entered the house through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E
