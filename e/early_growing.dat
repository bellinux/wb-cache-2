50|$|Weeds are {{the major}} biotic {{stresses}} for finger millet cultivation. Its seeds are very small, {{which leads to a}} relatively slow development in <b>early</b> <b>growing</b> stages. This makes finger millet a weak competitor for light, water and nutrients compared with weeds. In East and Southern Africa, the closely related species Eleusine indica (common name Indian goose grass) is a severe weed competitor of finger millet. Especially in <b>early</b> <b>growing</b> stages of the crop and the weed and when broadcast seeding instead of row seeding is applied (as often the case in East Africa), the two species are very difficult to distinguish. Besides Eleusine indica, the species Xanthium strumarium, which is animal disperesed and the stolon-owning species Cyperus rotondus and Cynodon dactylon are important finger millet weeds. Measures to control weeds include cultural, physical and chemical methods. Cultural methods could be sowing in rows instead of broadcast sowing in order to make distinction between finger millet seedlings and Eleusine indica easier when hand weeding. ICRISAT promotes cover crops and crop rotations to discrupt the growing cycle of the weeds. Physical weed control in financial resource limited communities growing finger millet are mainly hand weeding or weeding with a hand hoe.|$|E

50|$|The Temecula Valley {{is located}} 500 mi south of San Francisco, {{resulting}} in a slightly higher angle to the sun and greater solar intensity. A look at the native chaparral shows that Temecula is in a relatively low rainfall region. These two factors create an <b>early</b> <b>growing</b> season that generally runs from March through September. Rains, however, rarely interrupt the harvest season, {{an important factor in}} wine quality. Extensive research showed that the Temecula Valley was ideal for growing high quality wine grapes as mist often lingers until mid-morning on this 1400 ft plateau, located below the peaks of the local mountain range.|$|E
