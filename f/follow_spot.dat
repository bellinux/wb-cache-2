50|$|The Altman stage {{lighting}} company, {{established in}} 1953, {{is one of}} the leading manufacturers of theatrical lighting instruments. They are located in Yonkers, New York and have been a family run business since the 1950s. Altman specializes in theatrical ellipsoidal lights and <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> as well as a series of architectural fixtures.|$|R
50|$|Strong {{introduced}} {{their first}} version of the solid-state switching 1 kW-3 kW power supply for their xenon <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> in 1988, without having to engineer any modifications to the Super Trouper's operational design. This new solid-state power supply unit weighed in at approximately sixty-five pounds (30 kg), which was roughly one third the weight of its high reactance predecessor.|$|R
5000|$|Strong {{introduced}} the Super Trouper II model xenon <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> in 1995 {{as the first}} new <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> design since the xenon Gladiator III in 1983. With it, Strong also released a new [...] "DC" [...] ignitor assembly, which was a simpler and more reliable version of its predecessor: the [...] "AC" [...] ignitor. It allowed for a shorter ignition time and required less space than the standard AC ignitors found in standard Super Trouper followspots.|$|E
5000|$|Head Followspot Operator - In some shows, a {{separate}} technician gives all cues to the <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> operators {{to reduce the}} stage manager's workload.|$|E

50|$|In 1997, he {{returned}} to Italy, where he created his first couture accessories and shoes line, gaining immediate interest from both press and celebrities such as Sophia Loren and Madonna.In 1999 the launch of his own brand <b>followed</b> <b>spotting</b> the 'extreme white' collection in the Camera Nazionale della Moda Italiana fashion week: he was praised for {{the launch of the}} 'new-chic' style.|$|R
50|$|With {{very few}} exceptions, Strong has {{maintained}} a consistent design on Super Trouper models since the first xenon-type models were introduced in the late 1970s. Initially the reflector unit was composed of electroformed nickel with a rhodium plating. Today, Super Trouper <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> are shipped from the factory with a similarly-designed nickel reflector, though a dichroic coating has supplanted the rhodium coating.|$|R
50|$|The Super Trouper line of xenon <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> is {{inclusive}} of four production models: Super Trouper Long Throw, Super Trouper Short Throw, Super Trouper Medium Throw, and Super Trouper II. Each model {{is available in}} either a 1600 watt or a 2000 watt variety. As of 2006, Strong has limited production of Super Trouper Short Throws and Medium Throws to special request only.|$|R
5000|$|Electricians, or more {{commonly}} known as [...] "Lighting technicians", set up all the lights, program the light design in the lighting console and run the <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> (what people often call a spotlight).|$|E
50|$|Color Frames - Changes {{the color}} of the light. May also known as a boomerang and/or a color magazine. Color {{magazines}} contain the color gels, which are counted {{from the rear of the}} <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> forward.|$|E
5000|$|A color {{magazine}} is a fixture {{attached to a}} <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> that places different color filters {{in the path of}} the beam. Instead of working with comparatively cumbersome gel frames, the color magazine allows the spot operator to easily slide color frames in or out of place using a series of levers.|$|E
25|$|The followspot (also {{called a}} spotlight, trackspot, lime (uk), or dome) is a {{lighting}} instrument that is moved during {{a performance by}} an operator or by DMX control to provide emphasis or extra illumination and usually to follow a specific performer moving around the stage. <b>Follow</b> <b>spots</b> are commonly used in musical theater and opera to highlight the stars of a performance, but {{may be used in}} dramas well. They are also used in sports venues, as well as many other applications.|$|R
25|$|These {{lighting}} instruments come in {{a variety}} of sizes with light sources ranging from low power incandescent light bulbs to very powerful xenon arc lamps. Carbon arc lamp spots were common until the 1990s, using the arc between carbon rods as their light source. These <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> required special installations that include high volume ventilation due to the hazardous fumes produced by the carbon arc. The current generation, xenon, has extremely high internal pressure in the lamp and thus has its own safety concerns.|$|R

50|$|Toksvig {{was born}} in Denmark. Her father, Claus Toksvig, was a Danish {{journalist}} and broadcaster and foreign correspondent, so Toksvig {{spent most of her}} youth outside Denmark, mostly in New York City. Her mother, Julie Anne Toksvig (née Brett) is British. She attended Tormead School, an independent girls' school near Guildford, when her father was based in London. Her first job was a position as a <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> operator for the musical Jesus Christ Superstar at the age of 18.|$|E
5000|$|In October 1980, {{the music}} video for [...] "Super Trouper" [...] used {{the largest number}} of artists that ABBA ever used in a music video. The {{spotlight}} featured throughout the music video is, in fact, a CCT Silhouette <b>follow</b> <b>spot,</b> as opposed to a real Super Trouper. The city of Glasgow mentioned in the lyric was suggested by Howard Huntridge who worked with their then-UK publishers Bocu Music. The music video was directed by Lasse Hallström. Parts of the music video were later reused in the Happy New Year video.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] Followspot Operator is {{the person}} who {{operates}} the followspot, or spotlight on a production. This is a light which is physically moved by the operator during the production to follow a performer's movement around the stage. A <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> may also have mechanisms to change color, as well as an iris to change the diameter of the projected circle of light. The followspot operator may have to change several aspects of the beam from their unit simultaneously. This position is more common in musical theatre and concerts than for drama.|$|E
50|$|Belasco {{became one}} of the first {{directors}} to eschew the use of traditional footlights in favor of lights concealed below floor level, thereby hidden from the audience. His lighting assistant, Louis Hartmann, fabricated Belasco's design ideas. He also used <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> to further create realism and often tailored his lighting configurations to complement the complexions and hair of the actors. He ordered a specially made 1000-watt lamp developed just for his own productions, and was the only director to have one for the first two years after its introduction (1914-1915).|$|R

5000|$|The Technical Apprentices {{perform a}} variety of {{backstage}} functions. They are divided into five separate running crews: costumes, scenery, electrics, properties, and production/music services. These five crews perform the majority of work on the daily changeovers between the five operas of the summer season and also fill positions crucial to the live running of productions. At {{the end of the}} summer, the apprentice crews are invited to apply for staff positions for the two weekends of [...] "Apprentice Scenes," [...] a showcase for the Apprentice Singers, and can serve as everything from costume and lighting designers, to lighting and stage supervisors, to <b>follow</b> <b>spot</b> operators and assistant stage managers and more.|$|E
5000|$|By catalog T61, {{issued in}} 1954, the arc spots were {{represented}} by a single model, while the Klieglight line offered models ranging from 250 watt to 3000 watt spots. The company was also offering their [...] "Dynabeam" [...] lensed <b>follow</b> <b>spot,</b> and fresnels from 100 to 2000 watts. In that era of patch panels and small numbers of high wattage dimmers, Kliegl Brothersoffered its [...] "Safpatch" [...] patch panels, and [...] "Rotolector" [...] rotary power switches, both developed by Herbert Kliegl. Both products interlocked the electrical contacts with a circuit breaker, preventing arcs while switching or patching.From {{the beginning of the}} firm's operations, custom products were readily available. Indeed, the craft shop system used throughout its history made little differentiation between custom and standard products. High-end lighting designers regularly sought out Kliegl Brothers, who could design and produce the hardware that would fulfill their visions. Often, the custom product made its mark on the industry, such as the wall washers designed for the UN General Assembly room, or the fluorescent wall washers for New York's Pan American (now Met Life) building lobby, both designed by Herbert Kliegl. A custom oddity was the scoreboard designed for Madison Square Garden, across 50th Street from the factory. This remained in use until the relocation of the Garden to its current home atop Penn Station.|$|E

50|$|Architect D. G. Malcolm {{designed}} the Comedy Theatre, a Broadway theatre located at 110 West 41st Street in Manhattan, for The Shubert Organization. Its first production, The Melting Pot, opened September 6, 1909. The 687-seat theatre was {{a venue for}} more intimate productions, and was often leased to producers including William Collier, Cecil B. DeMille, and the Washington Square Players. Katharine Cornell made her first Broadway appearance at the Comedy Theatre, and Ruth Draper also made her debut there. Eugene O'Neill's first Broadway play, In the Zone, opened at the Comedy Theatre in 1917. With its narrow orchestra pit and a booth for <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> {{at the rear of}} the second balcony, the theatre was also used for small musical shows.|$|R
50|$|Within {{the theatre}} itself (right), two wooden towers were {{constructed}} {{to the sides}} of the audience area for <b>follow</b> <b>spots</b> and, on occasion, musicians. Seating surrounded the thrust stage on three sides, with no seat more than 18 feet from the stage. There was a crossover under the upstage edge, with traps under the stage. Although the theatre was an Off Off Broadway venue, limited to 99 seats by the company's contract with Actors Equity Association, the Riverside Shakespeare Company often launched major productions to Off Broadway status, as with its summer tours of Free Shakespeare and other specific productions. At this location the theatre began a subscription season of four to five plays, {{as a member of the}} Alliance of Resident Theatres in New York.|$|R

This paper describes a 3 rd year project {{as part of}} an electronics degree at the University of Southampton, which aims to automate a followspot tracking systems. The technique chosen utilises a wearable belt pack for the actor, which contains a radio receiver for synchronisation and an ultrasound transmitter, whose signal can be picked up by various stationary receivers on the stage. From these signals, the transport delay is determined, permitting the calculation the exact position of the pack by triangulation. The minimum accuracy of the system is around 10 cm. 1...|$|E
