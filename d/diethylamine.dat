5|$|To furnish a {{functional}} oligonucleotide, all the protecting groups {{have to be}} removed. The N-acyl base protection and the 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection may be, and is often removed simultaneously by treatment with inorganic bases or amines. However, the applicability of this method {{is limited by the}} fact that the cleavage of 2-cyanoethyl phosphate protection gives rise to acrylonitrile as a side product. Under the strong basic conditions required for the removal of N-acyl protection, acrylonitrile is capable of alkylation of nucleic bases, primarily, at the N3-position of thymine and uracil residues to give the respective N3-(2-cyanoethyl) adducts via Michael reaction. The formation of these side products may be avoided by treating the solid support-bound oligonucleotides with solutions of bases in an organic solvent, for instance, with 50% triethylamine in acetonitrile or 10% <b>diethylamine</b> in acetonitrile. This treatment is strongly recommended for medium- and large scale preparations and is optional for syntheses on small scale where the concentration of acrylonitrile generated in the deprotection mixture is low.|$|E
25|$|Remote {{burning of}} the {{explosive}}. Where possible, {{it is better to}} burn the explosive without detonation. Diethylene triamine (a close relative of ethylenediamine) reacts with TNT to generate heat. The compound that results from this reaction can then be combusted without detonation. It has been reported that this amine is hypergolic with TNT, Tetryl, Composition B and other TNT based explosives, but it does not react in the same way with RDX or PETN-based explosives. Other nitrogen-containing organic ligands (e.g. pyridine, <b>diethylamine</b> and pyrole) are known to be hypergolic with TNT.|$|E
2500|$|CuI {{is used as}} a reagent {{in organic}} synthesis. In {{combination}} with 1,2- or 1,3 diamine ligands, CuI catalyzes the conversion of aryl, heteroaryl, and vinyl bromides into the corresponding iodides. NaI is the typical iodide source and dioxane is a typical solvent (see aromatic Finkelstein reaction). [...] Aryl halides are used to form carbon–carbon and carbon–heteroatom bonds in process such as the Heck, Stille, Suzuki, Sonogashira and Ullmann type coupling reactions. [...] Aryl iodides, however, are more reactive than the corresponding aryl bromides or aryl chlorides. 2-Bromo-1-octen-3-ol and 1-nonyne are coupled when combined with dichlorobis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II), CuI, and <b>diethylamine</b> to form 7-methylene-8-hexadecyn-6-ol.|$|E
2500|$|In the United Kingdom, United States, India, and Brazil {{diclofenac}} may {{be supplied}} as either the sodium or potassium salt; in China, {{it is most}} often supplied as the sodium salt, while in some other countries it is only available as the potassium salt. It is available as a generic drug {{in a number of}} formulations, including diclofenac <b>diethylamine,</b> which is applied topically. Over-the-counter (OTC) use is approved in some countries for minor aches and pains and fever associated with common infections.

50|$|NaOH (s) (sodium hydroxide) is a {{stronger}} base than (CH3CH2)2NH (l) (<b>diethylamine)</b> which is {{a stronger}} base than NH3 (g) (ammonia). As the bases get weaker, the smaller the Kb values become.|$|E
50|$|Benzyl cinnamate can be {{prepared}} by heating benzyl chloride and excess sodium cinnamate in water to 100-115 °C or by heating sodium cinnamate with an excess of benzyl chloride {{in the presence of}} <b>diethylamine.</b>|$|E

5000|$|<b>Diethylamine</b> is {{an organic}} {{compound}} with the formula (CH3CH2)2NH. It is a secondary amine. It is a flammable, weakly alkaline liquid that is miscible with most solvents. It is a colorless liquid, but commercial samples often appear brown due to impurities. It {{has a strong}} ammonia-like odor.|$|E
50|$|Aminocarb {{undergoes}} hydrolysis to 4-dimethylamino-3-methylphenol in 25 °C {{purified water}} when pH {{of the water}} is 6.4. 4-dimethylamino-3-methylphenol is then either directly or via 2-methyl-1,4-dihydorquinone converted to 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone. If methylamine or <b>diethylamine</b> {{are present in the}} solution 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone will readily react. Monoepoxides and diepoxides of 2-methyl-1,4-benzoquinone are formed.|$|E
50|$|The Sonogashira {{reaction}} is typically run under mild conditions. The cross-coupling {{is carried out}} at room temperature with a base, typically an amine, such as <b>diethylamine,</b> that also acts as the solvent. The reaction medium must be basic to neutralize the hydrogen halide produced as the byproduct of this coupling reaction, so alkylamine compounds such as triethylamine and <b>diethylamine</b> are sometimes used as solvents, but also DMF or ether {{can be used as}} solvent. Other bases such as potassium carbonate or cesium carbonate are occasionally used. In addition, deaerated conditions are formally needed for Sonogashira coupling reactions because the palladium(0) complexes are unstable in the air, and oxygen promotes the formation of homocoupled acetylenes. Recently, development of air-stable organopalladium catalysts enable this reaction to be conducted in the ambient atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|Methanococcoides methylutens is a methylotrophic marine methanogen, {{the type}} species of its genus. It utilises trimethylamine, <b>diethylamine,</b> monomethylamine, and {{methanol}} as substrates {{for growth and}} methanogenesis. Cells are non-motile, non-spore-forming, irregular cocci 1 μm in diameter which stain Gram-negative and occur singly or in pairs. TMA-10 is the type strain (ATCC 33938).|$|E
50|$|Hydrogenation of acetonitrile, acetamide, and {{nitroethane}} affords ethylamine. These reactions can be effected stoichiometrically using lithium aluminium hydride. In another route, ethylamine can be synthesized via nucleophilic {{substitution of}} a haloethane (such as chloroethane or bromoethane) with ammonia, utilizing a strong base such as potassium hydroxide. This method affords {{significant amounts of}} byproducts, including <b>diethylamine</b> and triethylamine.|$|E
50|$|Ishikawa's reagent is {{a popular}} {{alternative}} to the DAST reagent, since it is shelf-stable and easily prepared from inexpensive and innocuous reagents. It is an improvement on Yarovenko's reagent, the adduct of chlorotrifluoroethylene and <b>diethylamine,</b> which must be prepared in a sealed vessel and once prepared keeps {{only for a few}} days, even in the refrigerator.|$|E
50|$|Hofmann drew {{an analogy}} between aniline and ammonia. He wanted to {{convince}} chemists that organic bases {{could be described}} in terms of derivatives of ammonia. Hofmann successfully converted ammonia into ethylamine and the compounds <b>diethylamine,</b> triethylamine, and tetraethylammonium. He was the first chemist to synthesize the quaternary amines. His method of converting an amide into an amine is known as the Hofmann rearrangement.|$|E
50|$|In chemistry, a NONOate is a {{compound}} having the chemical formula R1R2N−(NO−)−N=O, where R1 and R2 are alkyl groups. One example {{for this is}} 1,1-diethyl-2-hydroxy-2-nitrosohydrazine, or <b>diethylamine</b> dinitric oxide. These compounds are unusual in having three sequential nitrogen atoms: an amine functional group, a bridging NO− group, and a terminal nitrosyl group. In contact with water, these compounds release NO (nitric oxide).|$|E
50|$|LSD is an ergoline derivative. It is {{commonly}} synthesized by reacting <b>diethylamine</b> with an activated form of lysergic acid. Activating reagents include phosphoryl chloride and peptide coupling reagents. Lysergic acid {{is made by}} alkaline hydrolysis of lysergamides like ergotamine, a substance usually derived from the ergot fungus on agar plate; or, theoretically possible, but impractical and uncommon, from ergine (lysergic acid amide, LSA) extracted from morning glory seeds. Lysergic acid can also be produced synthetically, {{eliminating the need for}} ergotamines.|$|E
50|$|The lactone is ring-opened with <b>diethylamine</b> to amide 2 and its {{hydroxyl}} group is protected as a tert-butyldimethyl (TBS) silyl ether in 3. The C5 and C6 atoms are added as tert-butyldiphenylsilyl (TBDPS) protected iodoethanol in a nucleophilic substitution of acidic C4 with LDA at -78 °C to 4 with correct stereochemistry. Removal of the silyl protecting group with p-toluenesulfonic acid to alcohol 4b and ring-closure by azeotropic distillation returns the compound to lactone 5 (direct alkylation of 1 met with undisclosed problems).|$|E
5000|$|In May of {{the same}} year, Buchwald {{published}} {{an extension of the}} Migita paper offering two major improvements over the original paper. First, transamination of Bu3SnNEt2 followed by argon purge to remove the volatile <b>diethylamine</b> allowed extension of the methodology to a variety of secondary amines (both cyclic and acyclic) and primary anilines. Secondly, the yield for electron rich and electron poor arenes was improved via minor modifications to the reaction procedure (higher catalyst loading, higher temperature, longer reaction time), although no ortho-substituted aryl groups were included in this publication.|$|E
