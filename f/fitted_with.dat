40|$|Research {{has shown}} that group {{identification}} and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the group are strongly tied to each other: the emotions of high group identifiers are more {{closely linked to the}} group’s emotions than the emotions of low group identifiers (e. g., Tanghe, Wisse, & van der Flier, 2010; Totterdell, Kellett, Teuchmann, & Briner, 1998; Totterdell, 2000). Whereas previous research has focused mainly on default, positive experiences within groups, we propose that the link between group identification and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the group may depend on the valence of the situation in which the emotions take place. More specifically, we will argue that the positive relationship between group identification and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the group may be attenuated or even reversed when group members are faced with a negative situation. In such a situation, high group identifiers may have a more positive outlook and thus react in a more positive way as compared to the other members of their group. In the current research, we investigated the link between group identification and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the group, both in reaction to a positive and a negative event. More specifically, in 85 teams (N = 789) of a large Belgian non-profit organization, we examined the association between team identification and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the team in response to two vignettes, describing either a positive situation or a negative situation at work. In response to a positive situation at work, the relationship between team identification and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the team was positive, replicating earlier research. However, in response to a negative situation at work, the relationship between team identification and emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the team was negative. Thus, in a negative situation, high team identifiers showed less emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the team as compared to low team identifiers. Our research thus suggests {{that it is important to}} take into account the context when studying the link between group identification and emotional fit, and that it may not always be beneficial to show emotional <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> the group. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{reported in}} this paper is aimed at developing knowledge on organizing NPD systems to optimize their contribution to performance. To this end, a systems approach to fit is used to explain the context-structure-performance relationships for NPD performance, specifically in terms of <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> market demands of the product concept and <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> time constraints of the development process. From a sample of 164 US firms, the top 15 % performers {{in terms of both}} <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> market demands and <b>fit</b> <b>with</b> time constraints have been identified. An optimized ‘Ideal Profile’ for the organization of NPD systems, formed by a consistent pattern of: NPD Process, NPD Project Structure and Management, Innovation Climate, and NPD Goal Setting and Portfolio Management, followed from the analysis of the NPD configuration of these top performers. For the calibration sample (the other 85 %) significant deviation from the ideal profile on all elements of the configuration was found, the correlations between NPD Performance <b>Fit</b> <b>with</b> Market Demands and <b>Fit</b> <b>with</b> Time Constraints and total Euclidean distance are also significant. Overall, these results provide evidence for the proposition that (1) new product success is a function of a set of NPD development system decisions and (2) to truly understand the impact of those decisions, they must be considered as a holistic system. The contribution of this research is in the empirical validation of the internal consistency of an ideal organizational profile for NPD systems achieving both a high NPD performance in terms of market acceptance of their new products as well in terms of the satisfactory level of the development times of those products. By also examining ideal profiles for each of these NPD performance dimensions separately, the conflicting demands created by multiple performance metrics are highlighted as well as the organizational trade-offs necessary for optimal performance. In terms of managerial implications, this also gives direction for organizational redesign to firms either wanting to maximize their product concept (<b>Fit</b> <b>with</b> Market Demands) or development process (<b>Fit</b> <b>with</b> Time Constraints) performance...|$|R

All {{of the aircraft}} were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> radar warning receivers {{by the end of}} 2012, and it is planned to equip the Hercules with Large Aircraft Infrared Countermeasures systems by 2016. As of 2015, the Hercules' communications capabilities were also to be updated by fitting the aircraft with satellite communications equipment and the equipment necessary to allow them to use the Link 16 data exchange network. At this time the C-130s were also to be <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> new high-speed airdrop ramps at the rear of their cabin, and will be cleared to drop larger loads. The C-130J's operating software has also been upgraded over time, leading to improved performance. The RAAF is participating in the development of further software enhancements. During 2016 all of the C-130Js were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> advanced satellite communications systems that allowed the aircraft, and embarked troops, to be retasked while in flight. As part of this modification the aircraft were <b>fitted</b> <b>with</b> an additional crew station, and they carry a fourth crew member when necessary to handle complex communications tasks.|$|E
