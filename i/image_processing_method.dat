Due to the interference noise existing in the receiving process, the received image information may be drifted, the recognition may be poor, and the definition might be low. In order to improve the recognizability of the restored image, firstly, based on image noise analysis, cumulative averaging and noise smoothing, this paper proposes an <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> <b>method</b> based on ambiguity for electromagnetic leakage emission reduction image.

In this paper we present use of the Common Object Request Broker Architecture (CORBA), as the mean for connecting existing systems for <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> and artificial intelligence. To visualize this, we will use CORBA for connecting Dynamic Imager and JavaCreek. Dynamic Imager is an <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> software, that is especially suitable for setting up and test customized sequences of <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> operations. JavaCreek is an artificial intelligence software based on the Case-Based Reasoning (CBR) theory. After connecting the two systems with CORBA, we proceed develop the specific <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> <b>methods</b> for data gathering, and a knowledge base for diagnosis in the artificial intelligence system. The <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> <b>methods</b> and the knowledge base are produced for one special knowledge domain, for visualizing how the proposed system can help in medical image diagnostics. The task we use to visualize our approach, is detecting malignancy in breast tumors, from magnetic resonance (MR) images taken over time as contrast agents is injected. This is from a reasonably new method for deciding if a tumor is malignant or benign. All <b>image</b> <b>processing</b> <b>methods</b> and the knowledge base is produced to let the two systems cooperate to find and diagnose tumors.
