40|$|This paper surveys {{three months}} of spam data and investigates the hosting {{strategy}} of spam domains {{that are used to}} sell pharmaceutical, luxury goods and sexual enhancement tools. Thousands of domains have been found and most of them use wildcard DNS records to support non-existing machine names. The hosting IP addresses are much fewer than the number of domains, with a large number of domains hosted on a limited number of hosts. The majority of these heavily-used hosts reside in networks outside the USA. These hosts are stable and have good connectivity and availability. As a result, many domains on these hosts are alive for the entire three-month <b>investigation</b> <b>period.</b> The hosting <b>IP</b> addresses began to move in late March. The new IP addresses, however, are still in the same network range as the old IP addresses. The result suggests that further investigation on spam web hosting will be beneficial in disrupting the spamming network. 1...|$|R

Improved knowledge of this relationship may allow selection of k to optimize hatchling cardiac health. Egg weights (EW), eggshell conductance (G) and lengths of the incubation <b>period</b> (<b>IP)</b> (the three components of k) were manipulated to determine their effect on the heart. Eggs were selected based on EW and G in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, eggs from the same strain were obtained from flocks of different ages so they differed in EW. Half of the eggs were exposed to increased temperature treatments resulting in shorter incubation <b>periods</b> (<b>IP).</b> Interactions of EW and G affected heart weight and metabolism in Experiment 1. In Experiment 2, imposing short IP on different EW reduced cardiac weights as well as elevated glycogen to lactate ratios in the heart. Post-hatching growth was also depressed by k due to interactions of EW and IP. Thus, k affects cardiac weight and function and may contribute to weak poults...|$|R

Botrytis sp. isolated from figs proved to be pathogenic to immature fruit with and without wounding the fruit surface and ostiole. The <b>IP</b> <b>period</b> was 3 days on fruit with wounds and 5 days on fruit inoculated within the ostiole (without wound). The LP was 6 days in all treatments.

40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks (WSN) {{the medium}} access control CSMA/CA uses binary exponential backoff (BEB) algorithm to minimize collision among the contending nodes.

Soybean biodiesel was oxidized at different temperatures (room temperature, 60, and 110 °C), and the increase in primary and secondary oxidation products was determined based on the peroxide and anisidine values, respec-tively, during the induction <b>period</b> (<b>IP).</b> The results indicated that the evolution of hydroperoxides followed zero-order reaction kinetics during the IP at all temperatures, and their rate of formation was exponentially affected by temperature. It was also deduced that temperature influenced the ratio between primary and second-ary oxidation products formation, which decreased as the temperature increased. Additionally, it was possible to predict the oxidation behavior of the soybean biodiesel at room temperature by an exponential model fitted to the IP values at different temperatures (70, 80, 90, 100, and 110 °C) using the Rancimat apparatus...|$|R
