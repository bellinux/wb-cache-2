5|$|Parallel-coupled {{lines is}} another popular {{topology}} for printed boards, for which open-circuit lines are the simplest to implement since the manufacturing consists of {{nothing more than}} the printed track. The design consists of a row of parallel λ/2 resonators, but coupling over only λ/4 to each of the neighbouring resonators, so forming a staggered line as shown in figure 9. Wider fractional bandwidths are possible with this filter than with the capacitive gap filter, but a similar problem arises on printed boards as <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> reduces the Q. Lower-Q lines require tighter coupling and smaller gaps between them which is limited by the accuracy of the printing process. One solution to this problem is to print the track on multiple layers with adjacent lines overlapping but not in contact because they are on different layers. In this way, the lines can be coupled across their width, which results in much stronger coupling than when they are edge-to-edge, and a larger gap becomes possible for the same performance. For other (non-printed) technologies, short-circuit lines may be preferred since the short-circuit provides a mechanical attachment point for the line and Q-reducing dielectric insulators are not required for mechanical support. Other than for mechanical and assembly reasons, there is little preference for open-circuit over short-circuit coupled lines. Both structures can realize the same range of filter implementations with the same electrical performance. Both types of parallel-coupled filters, in theory, do not have spurious passbands at twice the centre frequency as seen in many other filter topologies (e.g., stubs). However, suppression of this spurious passband requires perfect tuning of the coupled lines which is not realized in practice, so there is inevitably some residual spurious passband at this frequency.|$|E

40|$|Piezoelectric {{properties}} and <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> have been measured in polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) /polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) blends {{to assess the}} value of this class of polymers as ultrasonic transducer materials. The electromechanical coupling factor k(t) has been found to become vanishingly small in blends having a PMMA content of about 20 % by weight. For the same blend composition, the peak of <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses,</b> which at room temperature is located in the low megahertz range, decreases only by 20 %. For low PMMA content blends at room temperature, the slow decrease of <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> and the slight frequency shift of the loss peak in the megahertz region are ascribed to the presence of two conjugate amorphous phases. This structure prevents much stronger effects on <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> which could be expected from blending PVDF with a polymer having a high glass transition temperature, such as PMMA. PVDF-PMMA blends, therefore do not represent an attractive class of ultrasonic transducer materials...|$|R
25|$|Ripple current generates heat {{within the}} {{capacitor}} body due to the ESR of the capacitor. The ESR, composed out of the <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> caused by the changing field strength in the <b>dielectric</b> and the <b>losses</b> resulting out of the slightly resistive supply lines or the electrolyte depends on frequency and temperature. For ceramic and film capacitors in generally ESR decreases with increasing temperatures but heighten with higher frequencies due to increasing <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses.</b> For electrolytic capacitors up to roughly 1nbsp&MHz ESR decreases with increasing frequencies and temperatures.|$|R

25|$|Ionic {{relaxation}} comprises {{ionic conductivity}} and interfacial and space charge relaxation. Ionic conductivity predominates at low frequencies and introduces only losses to the system. Interfacial relaxation occurs when charge carriers are trapped at interfaces of heterogeneous systems. A related effect is Maxwell-Wagner-Sillars polarization, where charge carriers blocked at inner dielectric boundary layers (on the mesoscopic scale) or external electrodes (on a macroscopic scale) {{lead to a}} separation of charges. The charges may be separated by a considerable distance and therefore make contributions to the <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> that are orders of magnitude larger than the response due to molecular fluctuations.|$|E
40|$|Capacitance probe sensors are {{a popular}} {{electromagnetic}} method of measuring soil water content. However, {{there is concern}} {{about the influence of}} soil salinity on the sensor readings. In this study capacitance sensors are calibrated for a saline silty clay soil. An electric circuit model is used to relate the sensor's resonant frequency F to the permittivity () of the soil. The circuit model is able to account for the effect of <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> on the resonant frequency. Dielectric mixing models and empirical models are used to relate the permittivity to the soil water content (). The results show that the electric circuit model does not fit the F¿() data if the calibrated bulk electrical conductivity (EC) model is used. The <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> are overestimated. Increasing the exponent c in the tortuosity factor of the bulk EC model and thereby lowering the bulk EC and the <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> improves the performance of the model. Measured and calculated volumetric water contents compare reasonably well (R 2 = 0. 884). However, only 73 out of 88 data points can be described.

40|$|Stub {{resonators}} {{can be used}} {{to assess}} the dielectric properties of fluids. The resonance frequencies, determined from the amplitude versus frequency (AF) response of such resonators, are mainly determined by the permittivity of the fluid while damping arises from <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses.</b> Even though this methodology has been extensively reported in the literature, without almost any exception these studies refer to (near) ideal behavior regarding for example, geometry and negligibly low conductivity of the fluid studied. Online stub resonator-based sensors (i. e., flow-through) in use for industrial applications, however, quite often suffer from high <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses,</b> non-ideal material choice of the conductors from an electrical point of view and unconventional resonator geometry. Therefore, in order to ensure correct data interpretation, a straightforward model accounting for the effects of <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses,</b> conductor losses (skin effect) and impedance mismatches on the AF response is highly desirable. In addition, such a model can help to optimize future sensor designs. Here, we present a lumped parameter model, essentially based on telegrapher's equations, that accounts for the skin effect, <b>dielectric</b> <b>losses</b> and impedance mismatches between the transmission lines to the resonator and the resonator respectively. The adequacy of the method, even in the case of impedance mismatch, is demonstrated by comparing these model simulations with experimentally obtained AF curves for both flow-through coaxial stub resonators and microstrip resonators immersed in the fluid under investigatio...|$|R

2500|$|A {{microwave}} oven heats food by passing microwave radiation through it. [...] Microwaves are {{a form of}} non-ionizing electromagnetic radiation with a frequency higher than ordinary radio waves but lower than infrared light. [...] Microwave ovens use frequencies {{in one of the}} ISM (industrial, scientific, medical) bands, which are reserved for this use, so they do not interfere with other vital radio services. [...] Consumer ovens usually use 2.45 gigahertz (GHz)—a wavelength of —while large industrial/commercial ovens often use 915 megahertz (MHz)—. Water, fat, and other substances in the food absorb energy from the microwaves in a process called dielectric heating. Many molecules (such as those of water) are electric dipoles, meaning that they have a partial positive charge at one end and a partial negative charge at the other, and therefore rotate as they try to align themselves with the alternating electric field of the microwaves. Rotating molecules hit other molecules and put them into motion, thus dispersing energy. This energy, when dispersed as molecular vibration in solids and liquids (i.e. as both potential energy and kinetic energy of atoms), is heat. Sometimes, microwave heating is explained as a resonance of water molecules, but this is incorrect; such resonances occur only at above 1 terahertz (THz). Rather it is the lag in response of the polar water molecule to the impinging electromagnetic wave. This type of <b>dielectric</b> <b>loss</b> mechanism is referred to as dipole interaction.|$|E
