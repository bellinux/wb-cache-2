When one <b>dog</b> <b>marks</b> over another dog's urine, {{this is known}} as [...] "counter-marking" [...] or [...] "overmarking". Male dogs urine-mark more frequently than female dogs, typically beginning after the onset of sexual maturity. Male dogs, as well as wolves, sometimes lift a leg and attempt to urinate even when their bladders are empty– {{this is known as}} a [...] "raised-leg display", [...] "shadow-urination", or [...] "pseudo-urination".
