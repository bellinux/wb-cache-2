5|$|Robert Ashley used audio {{feedback}} in his avant-garde piece The Wolfman (1964) {{by setting up}} a howl between the microphone and loudspeaker and then singing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> in way that modulated the feedback with his voice.|$|E
5|$|He worked {{briefly as}} a scout for the Cleveland Indians. He later {{worked as a}} color {{commentator}} with the Rainiers and did advertising work in the Seattle area. During one game while Heath provided commentary, he cursed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> on-air and later apologized. A station manager later approached him regarding the incident and Heath responded by throwing the manager {{down a flight of}} stairs.|$|E
5|$|In the game, Neku Sakuraba and {{his allies}} are forced to {{participate}} in a game that will determine their fate. The battle system uses many of the unique features of the Nintendo DS, including combat that takes place on both screens, and attacks performed by certain motions on the touchscreen or by shouting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> Elements of Japanese youth culture, such as fashion, food, and cell phones, are key aspects of the missions.|$|E

50|$|The {{tracking}} {{of the parts}} was unorthodox in many ways ranging from drums recorded in alleyways on cassette tape recorders and then reprocessed through outboard gear to vocals being sung while moving round the room and brass performed by members of Antibalas Afrobeat Orchestra directed to not play directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>microphones</b> detect pitch using {{digital signal}} processing, which {{analyses}} {{the frequency of}} the incoming signal via Fast Fourier transform. The frequency is then compared to stored information to evaluate if the note is correct. Regular singing segments do not feature speech recognition, and so humming <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> at <b>the</b> correct pitch will also score points. Rap sections use a combination of speech recognition and rhythm detection.|$|R
5|$|The player {{controls}} Neku {{by performing}} touchscreen actions {{based on the}} currently equipped pins. These actions may include slashing across an enemy, tapping the screen rapidly to fire bullets, holding down on an enemy to inflict damage or shouting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> to cause a full screen attack. Other pins need to be touched to activate them, such as for health restoration. Each pin has {{a limited number of}} uses before it must recharge for a certain time. Other pins may only be used a fixed number of times during a series of battles, and do not recharge until the battle sequence is over. Neku can only be equipped with a maximum of two pins at the game's start; this can eventually be upgraded to a maximum of six.|$|E
5|$|During investigations, {{which usually}} take place before or in between trial sessions, the player gathers {{information}} and evidence {{by talking to}} characters such as their client, witnesses, and the police. The player is able to move around a cursor to examine various things in the environment. By using a menu, the player can move to different locations, examine evidence, and present evidence to other characters; by showing certain pieces of evidence to some witnesses, the player can get access to new information. In the game's fifth case, created for the DS version and used in all subsequent releases, the player is able to examine evidence more closely, rotating it to view it from all sides and zooming in or out on it using touchscreen controls; they are also able to move a cursor to investigate specific parts of the evidence. The fifth case also features forensics tests that the player can use at crime scenes to find clues: the player can spray luminol by tapping areas they want to examine on the touch screen, which makes the player able to see otherwise invisible blood stains; and they can touch the touch screen to apply aluminum flake powder in order to search for finger prints. After applying it, they can blow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> to reveal the prints. Once the player has gathered enough evidence, the investigation section ends.|$|E
5|$|At a Nintendo {{press conference}} in Tokyo, Japan on October 5, 2005, the company {{announced}} several games {{that it would be}} releasing in 2006 in Japan. The list included Brain Age 2, with a release date set for December 29, 2005. Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29, 2007 for €30, and in Australia on July 5, 2007 for A$49.95. The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007. The game is targeted to casual gamers, similar to its predecessor; its basic concepts stay the same as in , along with the graphics, menu, and presentation. Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine, an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available; Brain Age 2s rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles. All of the minigames in the game are new to the series; however, some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age. One of the challenges in the first game, Head Count, requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen; after a few seconds, a house falls on top of them, and then several people leave and enter the house. Afterward, the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house. A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2, called Memory Sprint, which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves, and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line. The game's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game. The only challenge that uses the feature, Rock, Paper, Scissors, requires that the player speak the correct answer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> as soon as possible.|$|E
30|$|In the HA scenario, {{since the}} LS output signals feed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones,</b> <b>the</b> {{closed-loop}} system {{formed by the}} HAs participates in the source mixing process, together with the acoustical mixing system. Therefore, the BSS inputs result from a mixture of the external sources and the feedback signals coming from the loudspeakers. But because of the closed-loop system bringing the HA inputs to the two LS outputs, the feedback signals are correlated with the original external source signals. To understand the impact of feedback on the separation performance of a BSS algorithm, we describe below the overall mixing process.|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION Seamless man-machine {{interaction}} and telecommunication call for ideal acoustic interfaces without constraints on position and {{movement of the}} human sound source in the local environment. As a first step, hands-free communication is already supported in car telephony, desktop audio- and videoconferencing, and multimedia computers, where it provides extra convenience and/or safety. However, with increasing distance between <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> and <b>the</b> local source, the signal-to-noise ratio of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> signal decreases and reverberation becomes increasingly objectionable. Here, microphone arrays (MAs) offer an extra directivity gain growing along the number of sensors, and digital array processing of <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> signals allows time-variant control of spatial and spectral selectivity [3, 6]. With full-duplex communication systems, the loudspeaker signal is fed back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone(s),</b> so that <b>the</b> remote partner receives an unwanted echo of the loudspeaker sig...|$|R
25|$|Most amateur digital modes are {{transmitted}} by inserting audio <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> input {{of a radio}} and using an analog scheme, such as amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation (FM), or single-sideband modulation (SSB).|$|E
25|$|The game {{features}} functionality {{with the}} Wii U GamePad, allowing players to rub the touchscreen, or blow <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> to reveal hidden blocks or items, hinder enemies and activate mechanisms. The game also supports Off-TV Play. The game is also {{compatible with the}} Wii Remote, Nunchuk, Classic Controller and Wii U Pro Controller. An unlockable Luigi-themed version of Mario Bros., titled Luigi Bros., can be accessed either by clearing the game, or by having save data from New Super Luigi U.|$|E
25|$|In the {{basement}} of the floor of the Rene Block Gallery in Berlin, Beuys positioned himself on the floor wrapped in a large felt blanket. Emerging from either end of the blanket were two dead hares, often seen in his performances. Around him was an installation of copper rod, felt and fat. Inside a blanket he held a microphone and for a period of eight hours grunted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> as viewers watched from the doorway. The grunts are compared to those of a stag, as the stag is a symbol of something like a chief. The performance directly relates and even includes elements of the Fluxus movement that Beuys was a part of. The grunting is seen in part of a composition as a reflection of suffering. Being wrapped in a felt blanket mirrors the story of his suffering and rescue by the Tartars after his plane crashed in the war.|$|E
5000|$|The first track {{recorded}} {{was the old}} blues standard, [...] "Tin Pan Alley", {{which was}} done in one take. Hammond said <b>into</b> <b>the</b> talkback <b>microphone,</b> [...] "That's <b>the</b> best you'll ever get that song. That sounded wonderful." ...|$|R
50|$|Bending the Arc was a site-specific, ephemeral work {{commissioned}} for Atlanta’s 2015 Flux Night {{to explore}} the legacies of Martin Luther King Jr. {{and the civil rights}} movement. As in previous public projects, Ma carefully investigated the site and the context of the project. Inspired by King’s contention that “the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice,” Ma projected a line of light on a wall in King’s former neighborhood. The line would vibrate, bounce, ricochet, or bend into an arch when audience participants whisper, speak, sing, or shout <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> that dotted <b>the</b> field, visualizing the collective force of human voice and breath.|$|R
5000|$|Spizz {{attended}} Arden School, Knowle, near Solihull, {{a comprehensive}} {{school in the}} West Midlands, and {{was inspired by the}} burgeoning punk rock movement. After a Siouxsie and the Banshees gig at Birmingham's Barbarellas club [...] he jumped on stage and sang <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> on <b>the</b> back of which was given a recording deal. He was already performing (solo) by 1977. Spizz soon got together with like-minded guitarist Pete Petrol (real name Pete O'Dowd) with whom he released a few singles {{during the height of the}} punk's popularity. In 1978 Palmolive, drummer with The Slits, joined the band, then named Spizzoil, for a few gigs.|$|R

500|$|The Edge overdubbed the song's slide {{acoustic}} guitar, {{which was}} [...] "amplified through a blaster", {{while working on}} guitar compositions in a lounge next to the main studio of Windmill Lane Studios. Lanois {{walked into the room}} and, impressed by the sound of the Edge's playing, wanted to record it on the spot rather than in the studio. Lanois brought the Edge headphones and plugged his guitar directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> input of the mixing console to record it. The producer said: [...] "The blaster was amplifying his slide guitar in a lovely way. He had honed in on this sound and sort of altered the EQs and controls so that it was pleasant to him".|$|E
500|$|The next match, an [...] "I Quit" [...] match, {{took place}} between Bret Hart and Bob Backlund, with Roddy Piper as the guest referee. It was {{explained}} that, {{in order to win}} the match, a wrestler must force his opponent to say [...] "I quit" [...] into a microphone held by Piper. Hart attempted to perform the Sharpshooter early in the match; when Backlund blocked it, Hart executed a figure four leglock instead. Backlund escaped the hold and began trying to injure Hart's arm with an armbar hold. Hart then tried to attack Backlund {{in the corner of the}} ring, but Backlund moved and Hart hit his shoulder against the ring post. Backlund tried to perform the crossface chickenwing, his signature submission hold. Hart blocked him and performed the same hold on Backlund instead. Backlund made an unintelligible sound <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone,</b> and Piper determined that he had submitted. As a result, the win was awarded to Bret Hart.|$|E
500|$|In 1993, Bruce Dickinson {{left the}} band to further pursue his solo career, but agreed to remain for a {{farewell}} tour and two live albums (later re-released in one package). The first, A Real Live One, featured songs from 1986 to 1992, {{and was released}} in March 1993. The second, A Real Dead One, featured songs from 1980 to 1984, and was released after Dickinson had left the band. The tour did not go well, however, with Steve Harris claiming that Dickinson would only perform properly for high-profile shows and that at several concerts he would only mumble <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> Dickinson denies the charge that he was under-performing, stating {{that it was impossible}} to [...] "make like Mr Happy Face if the vibe wasn't right", saying that news of his exit from the band had prevented any chance of a good atmosphere during the tour. He played his farewell show with Iron Maiden on 28 August 1993, which was filmed, broadcast by the BBC and released on video under the name Raising Hell.|$|E

500|$|The {{television}} commercial for the Superstar Celebrity Microphone that Homer watches, {{was inspired by}} a popular Ronco Mr. Microphone commercial from the late 1970s, in which a boy becomes popular and [...] "scores with the girls" [...] by using his microphone to be on the radio. Both commercials feature a boy riding by in a car full of friends saying, [...] "Hey, good-looking, we'll be back to pick you up later," [...] a line the staff thought was [...] "hilarious". In the Superstar Celebrity Microphone commercial, the boy sings the 1975 song [...] "Convoy" [...] by C. W. McCall <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> The producers originally wanted him to sing [...] "The Wreck of the Edmund Fitzgerald" [...] by Gordon Lightfoot, a song about the sinking of the bulk carrier [...] on Lake Superior. However, according to Vitti, Lightfoot's licensing arrangement would have required the producers to get permission from the families of the twenty-nine crewmen who died on the ship, so [...] "Convoy" [...] was used instead. Homer also sings the song on the microphone to convince Bart to like the present.|$|E
500|$|The trial {{portions}} {{consist of}} listening to and cross-examining witness testimonies. The player is given the option to either Press or Present evidence in response to statements made by witnesses. The player can either select their choice or yell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone.</b> By choosing Press, the player questions the witness's statement, which sometimes causes the witness to change their testimony. When finding inconsistencies in the testimony, the player may choose Present {{in order to show}} a piece of evidence that they think contradicts the testimony. The player has a health bar, representing the judge's patience. If the player presents incorrect pieces of evidence or choose incorrect answers to questions in court, health is lost. If the health bar reaches zero, the player loses the game and their client is declared guilty. A new system, known as the [...] "Perceive System," [...] can be used to look for motions or actions made by witnesses that show nervousness, similar to a tell in poker. The game also includes a [...] "Crime Recreation Mode" [...] that models evidence or the crime scene in a 3-D rendition and allow the player to explore the recreation to look for clues. Additionally, the game often recreates the crime in cutscene sequences, allowing the player to observe the action and find contradictions.|$|E
500|$|The Beach Boys {{recorded}} {{using what}} was predominantly radio broadcasting equipment, which lacked {{many of the}} technical elements and effects found in an established studio. This led to unconventional ways of achieving particular sounds at the home, such {{as a replacement for}} what would be achieved by an echo chamber. The album's engineer Jim Lockert recalled how [...] "Brian's swimming pool had a leak in it and was empty, so we put a microphone in the bottom of this damn near Olympic-size pool and the guys laid down inside the pool and sang so the sound would go down the wall of the concrete pool <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> – and {{that was part of the}} vocals on one of those songs." [...] Some recording accidents were used to their advantage, such as in [...] "With Me Tonight", which contains an informal link between the verse and chorus by way of a voice saying [...] "good", as in [...] "good take", spoken by the band's road manager Arnie Geller from the control room. Lockert has spoken about other peculiarities of the sessions, including vocals being tracked in the shower. Due to this eclectic mix of recording paraphernalia and idiosyncratic methods of tracking the sounds, Smiley Smile possesses an unusual sound.|$|E
5000|$|Many airchecks {{are made}} by the announcers {{themselves}} on a recorder that begins recording when <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> is turned on and then goes <b>into</b> pause when <b>the</b> <b>microphone</b> goes off. In the 1960s and 1970s reels of tape were used for these [...] "skimmer" [...] airchecks. Later it was cassettes. Today many stations use minidiscs, recordable CDs or computer digital recordings for aircheck creation.|$|R

5000|$|De Gaulle {{stepped out}} onto the balcony to give a short address to the {{assembled}} masses which was also broadcast live on radio. In his speech he commented that his drive down the banks of the Saint Lawrence River, lined as it had been with cheering crowds, reminded him of his triumphant return to Paris after the liberation from Nazi Germany. The speech appeared to conclude with the words [...] "Vive Montréal! Vive le Québec!" [...] ("Long live Montreal! Long live Quebec!"), but he then added, [...] "Vive le Québec libre! Vive, vive, vive le Canada français! Et vive la France!" [...] ("Long live free Quebec! Long live, long live, long live French Canada! And long live France!"), whereupon the crowd roared with approval, especially after hearing, [...] "Vive le Québec libre!". De Gaulle particularly emphasized {{the use of the word}} 'libre', as he leaned <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>microphones</b> and enunciated it more slowly and loudly than other elements of his speech.|$|R
