[...] "You disgrace me by your cruel precautions; {{my own mother}} {{is the first to}} suspect me, and would take me away as my gaoler. I will not go with you, mother; I will go as no one's prisoner. If I wanted to deceive, do you think I could find no means of evading you? My family {{suspects}} me. As those mistrust me that ought to love me most, let me leave them; I will go, but I will go alone: to Castlewood, be it. I have been unhappy there and lonely enough; let me go back, but spare me at least the humiliation of setting a watch over my misery, which is a trial I can't bear. Let me go when you will, but alone, or not at all. You three can stay and triumph over my unhappiness, and I will bear it as I have borne it before. Let my gaoler-in-chief <b>go</b> <b>order</b> the coach that is to take me away. I thank you, Henry Esmond, for your share in the conspiracy. All my life long I'll thank you, and remember you, and you, brother, and you, mother, how shall I show my gratitude to you for your careful defence of my honor?" ...|$|E

40|$|Highly ordered {{graphite}} oxide intercalation compounds (GOIC) {{and fully}} disordered graphite oxide exfoliated compounds (GOEC) have been obtained, for two quaternary phosphonium salts. X-ray diffraction patterns of both GOIC and GOEC maintain the 100 and 110 reflections of GO, clearly indicating {{the maintenance of}} in-plane <b>GO</b> <b>order.</b> For GOICs, few 00 l reflections (with l up to 3) appear, indicating an increase with respect to GO of crystalline order {{as well as an}} increase of spacing between GO layers from 0. 84 nm up to 1. 40 nm. GOIC and GOEC have been compared for their kinetics of release in aqueous solutions of a phosphonium ion, being a known antibacterial agent. GOICs exhibit pH sensitive cation release, with zero order kinetics, which could be helpful for applications requiring triggered and constant supply of active ions...|$|E
