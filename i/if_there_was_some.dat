5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the pituitary gland is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the pituitary gland are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the pituitary gland. Surgery is most likely to improve vision <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E

It was also unique in that department in that all other amusement parks were fined for first offenses—except Action Park. It asked <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> sort of special relationship between GAR and the state.|$|E
25|$|At a sysop {{meeting in}} Dallas, {{the idea was}} raised {{that it would be}} nice <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> way for the sysops to post {{messages}} that would be shared among the systems. In February 1986 Jeff Rush, one of the group members, introduced a new mailer that extracted messages from public forums that the sysop selected, {{in a manner similar to}} the way the original mailer handled private messages. The new program was known as a tosser/scanner. The tosser produced a file that was similar (or identical) to the output from the normal netmail scan, however, these files were then compressed and attached to a normal netmail message as an attachment. This message was then sent to a special address on the remote system. After receiving netmail as normal, the scanner on the remote system looked for these messages, unpacked them, and put them into the same public forum on the original system.|$|E

In the case of Zeus, for instance, it was clear that building more fallout shelters would both be less expensive and save more lives than Zeus. A major report on the topic by PSAC in October 1961 made this point, suggesting that Zeus without shelters was useless, and that having Zeus might lead the US to [...] "introduce dangerously misleading assumptions concerning the ability of the US to protect its cities".|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{produced}} the 101 Bison Film Company. On August 23, 1910, the New York Clipper announced that J. W. Kerrigan had joined Universal Studios and would {{star in a}} new series of films directed by Allan Dwan. The first film listed was titled [...] "A Restless Spirit" [...] (The Restless Spirit) and the second film would be Shon the Piper. It is unknown <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> change in Shon the Pipers production or if the Clipper was mistaken because neither Kerrigan or Dwan are credited. Instead, Otis Turner would direct the film and the film would star Robert Z. Leonard and Margarita Fischer. Prior to his motion picture debut, Leonard previously had a noted stage career in the California Opera Company in a variety of roles and sung in over a hundred light operas. Joseph Singleton played The Laird of the Isla and would be credited through and answer column in The Photo-play Journal. The cast of the film was not billed or credited in the production. Michael Blake credits Lon Chaney in a role in this film in his book, The Films of Lon Chaney. Jon C. Mirsalis states that he cannot confirm or deny an appearance by Lon Chaney, but notes that the surviving film still does not show Lon Chaney.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} critics, {{with a few}} detractors. Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book, Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five, calling the script [...] "very stylish". The two noted that [...] " [...] Duchovny is very good here [...] and, as a counterbalance, [...] Anderson provides some great comic relief." [...] Shearman and Pearson concluded that the episode was [...] "a little too ponderously paced to be a classic episode, but it's clever and well crafted [...] a rewarding stand-out." [...] Rich Rosell from Digitally Obsessed awarded the episode 4 out of 5 stars and wrote that [...] "Cawing birds, spirit portals and split personalities are {{the order of the}} day in a story that doesn't offer that much in genuine thrills, but the best moments are Scully's occasional complaints from the field." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting that the episode [...] "gets off to an awkward start", Vitaris concluded that [...] "'Chimera' takes us into the heart of a quintessential X-Files family". Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+", noting that, while the episode was good, it [...] "falls short of classic status, trying to make a metaphor into flesh, and not quite succeeding." [...] Although Handlen enjoyed the way the episode explores and then connects the main characters, his main critique was that Ellen's transformation is never explicitly explained. He explained that, [...] "If we had a sense of where her need comes from, <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> hint at what drove her to this point, it would work; as is, the actress’s performance is excellent, but the character remains too generic." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{extensive}} touring {{in support}} of the band's third studio album, Veckatimest (2009), Grizzly Bear undertook a six-month hiatus from band-related activities. Vocalist Ed Droste noted, [...] "There was such a level of exhaustion that I really needed to pretend I wasn't in the band for a little bit. I needed to be back in my life with my friends and my spouse, and live a day-to-day existence {{that had nothing to do}} with music. That was really good for everybody." [...] Vocalist and guitarist Daniel Rossen stated, [...] "Those were strange times. [...] I felt a little bit shell-shocked by the touring experience of Veckatimest and part of me was just wondering <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> other version of a life that I could have that wasn't as heavily involved in the music industry." ...|$|E

It was <b>if</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> unfinished business, some sort of mix-up, something I never understood. It's a mystery." [...] Moore believes the site may be near the Welsh Harp reservoir – also known as Brent Reservoir – in north London. By chance, what {{is believed to have been}} the first cycle race in Britain took place at the Welsh Harp the day after Moore won in the Parc de St-Cloud. The race was won by Arthur Markham, who for many years had a bicycle shop nearby at 345 Edgware Road.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the Boston Globe {{disclosed}} that Bulger and Flemmi had been informants, Weeks met with retired agent John Connolly (later sentenced to 40 years in prison), who showed him a photocopy of Bulger's FBI informant file. In order to explain Bulger and Flemmi's status as informants, Connolly said, [...] "The Mafia was going against Jimmy and Stevie, so Jimmy and Stevie went against them." [...] According to Weeks, [...] "As I read over the files at the Top of the Hub that night, Connolly kept telling me that 90 percent of {{the information in the}} files came from Stevie. Certainly Jimmy hadn't been around the Mafia the way Stevie had. But, Connolly told me, he had to put Jimmy's name on the files to keep his file active. As long as Jimmy was an active informant, Connolly said, he could justify meeting with Jimmy and giving him valuable information. Even after he retired, Connolly still had friends in the FBI, and he and Jimmy kept meeting to let each other know what was going on. I listened to all that, but now I understood that even though he was retired, Connolly was still getting information, as well as money, from Jimmy. As I continued to read, I could see {{that a lot of the}} reports were not just against the Italians. There were more and more names of Polish and Irish guys, of people we had done business with, of friends of mine. Whenever I came across the name of someone I knew, I would read exactly what it said about that person. I would see, over and over again, that some of these people had been arrested for crimes that were mentioned in these reports. It didn't take long for me to realize that it had been bullshit when Connolly told me that the files hadn't been disseminated, that they had been for his own personal use. He had been an employee of the FBI. He hadn't worked for himself. <b>If</b> <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>some</b> investigation going on and his supervisor said, 'Let me take a look at that,' what was Connolly going to do? He had to give it up. And he obviously had. I thought about what Jimmy had always said, 'You can lie to your wife and to your girlfriends, but not to your friends. Not to anyone we're in business with.' Maybe Jimmy and Stevie hadn't lied to me. But they sure hadn't been telling me everything." ...|$|E
