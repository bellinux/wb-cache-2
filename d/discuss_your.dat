6000|$|Mrs. Wix at {{the same}} instant found another apostrophe. [...] "Isn't it enough for you, madam, to have brought her to <b>discussing</b> <b>your</b> relations?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “Pardon me; we {{will not}} <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> new car, if you please,” said Arthur. “We wish to talk of {{agreeable}} things. The marvelous Castro is concocting some of his mysterious dishes and we wish you to assist us in judging their merits.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Very often. But I see you {{are tired}} to death, and will wish you good night. We will <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> {{projects}} in the morning. You cannot but feel already that it is useless staying here, with any hope of advancing them. You {{will have to go}} further.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can do--everything," [...] the dry, toneless {{voice came}} from the wall speaker. [...] "It is all controlled. Kramer, I wish to talk to you. I've been--been thinking. I haven't seen you in many years. A lot to discuss. You've changed, boy. We have much to <b>discuss.</b> <b>Your</b> wife--" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} I did. I get {{the good things}} from him and the bad ones from you. But you're not to suppose," [...] Mrs. Brookenham went on, [...] "that I've <b>discussed</b> <b>your</b> horrible book with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! to three! {{obliged to}} <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> own most private {{concerns}} {{as well as}} mine with three intimate friends! You are lucky, sir, to have so many intimate friends. As my concerns have been made known to {{them as well as}} your own, may I ask who they are?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope you}} will believe, Mr. Courage," [...] he continued, turning towards me, [...] "that nothing was further from my thoughts. I simply say that as you are not {{interested}} in the matter which we are going to <b>discuss,</b> <b>your</b> presence is quite unnecessary, and might become a source of mutual embarrassment." ...|$|E
60|$|THE ELDERLY GENTLEMAN. No, no, no. I {{had much}} rather <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> {{intention}} of {{withdrawing from the}} Conservative party. How the Conservatives have tolerated your opinions so far is more than I can imagine: I can only conjecture that you have contributed very liberally to the party funds.

6000|$|... "My dear Burton," [...] Mr. Waddington exclaimed, {{with an air}} of some relief, [...] "your arrival is most opportune! Your {{wife has}} just paid me a visit. We were <b>discussing</b> <b>your</b> {{probable}} whereabouts only a moment ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, Mr. and Mrs. Micawber!' said my aunt, {{when they}} entered. 'We have been <b>discussing</b> <b>your</b> emigration, with many apologies {{to you for}} keeping {{you out of the}} room so long; and I'll tell you what {{arrangements}} we propose.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No--no, I haven't {{anybody in}} the world. That is why I hate {{vacation}}, that is why I've hated to hear you and the others <b>discussing</b> <b>your</b> vacation plans. You all have somebody to go to. It has just filled me up with hatred of my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I shall {{certainly}} do {{nothing of the}} kind," [...] said Ann, rising. She went {{with him to the}} door. [...] "Teddy would never forgive me." [...] She got into the cab. [...] "It's only because you have appealed to me to help you <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> future," [...] she said, as they drove off. [...] "Nothing else would have induced me [...] ." ...|$|E
6000|$|She put {{her hand}} to her bosom and looked about her restlessly. His {{intensity}} scared her. [...] "I know what you mean, but let us not talk of that now; let us <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> play. I want to suggest something for your third act, but I must dress now. You will wait, won't you? We will have a few minutes before I go on. Please sit here and wait for me." ...|$|E
6000|$|Jimmy had involuntarily {{acquired}} antipathy toward Bince {{at their}} first meeting, an antipathy which had been growing the more that he saw of the assistant general manager. This fact, coupled with Bince's present rather nasty manner, was rapidly arousing the anger of the efficiency expert. [...] "I didn't come in here," [...] he said, [...] "to <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> matrimonial prospects, Mr. Bince. I came in here to see the pay-roll, and you will oblige me by letting me see it." ...|$|E

But {{then your}} case {{would have been}} {{different}} from that of the other spectators: I should have explained the whole thing to you, and I am sure we would have had a great deal of pleasure, and profit too, in <b>discussing</b> <b>your</b> experiences.

6000|$|... "A merry Christmas, Bob!" [...] said Scrooge with an earnestness {{that could}} not be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. [...] "A merrier Christmas, Bob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I'll raise your salary, and {{endeavour}} to assist your struggling family, and we will <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of smoking bishop, Bob! Make up the fires and buy another coal-scuttle before you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you are Mlle. Agathe's father!" [...] exclaimed Joseph with {{pleasant}} condescension, as he {{took the}} letter of introduction, and, without glancing at it, slipped it {{into the pocket of his}} magnificent coat. Perhaps a thought subsequently crossed his mind that the timorous person before him was not quite so simple-minded as his watery blue eyes suggested, and that the dusty and crumpled little note might be a daring fraud practised on his own influential personality, for he added with stern emphasis: [...] "I will see Mlle. Agathe to-morrow, and will <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> affair with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... and the consequences, which wasted your life, pursue your reputation. For {{your stories}} has been {{reserved}} a boundless popularity, and that highest success--the {{success of a}} perfectly sympathetic translation. By this time, of course, you have made the acquaintance of your translator, M. Charles Baudelaire, who so strenuously shared your views about Mr. Emerson and the Transcendentalists, and who so energetically resisted all those ideas of 'progress' which 'came from Hell or Boston.' On this point, however, the world continues to differ from you and M. Baudelaire, and perhaps there is only the choice between our optimism and universal suicide or universal opium-eating. But to <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> ultimate ideas is perhaps a profitless digression from the topic of your prose romances.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, Loewenstein {{published}} his autobiography, A Prince Among Stones: That Business with The Rolling Stones and Other Adventures (Bloomsbury, London), which disclosed {{details of the}} band's financial arrangements.

60|$|Best {{known in}} your own day as a critic, it is as a poet and a writer of short tales that you must live. But to <b>discuss</b> <b>your</b> few and {{elaborate}} poems {{is a waste of}} time, so completely does your own brief definition of poetry, 'the rhythmic creation of the beautiful,' exhaust your theory, and so perfectly is the theory illustrated by the poems. Natural bent, and reaction against the example of Mr. Longfellow, combined to make you too intolerant of what you call the 'didactic' element in verse. Even if morality be not seven-eighths of our life (the exact proportion as at present estimated), there was a place even on the Hellenic Parnassus for gnomic bards, and theirs {{in the nature of the}} case must always be the largest public.|$|E
