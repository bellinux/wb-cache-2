40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} conducted to verify the functional and structural capability of the Centaur D- 1 A nose fairing. A full-scale flight-type nose fairing was jettisoned at the Lewis Research Center Space Power Chamber at simulated altitude. Two complete jettisons of the nose fairing were performed, one without aft <b>helper</b> <b>springs</b> and one with aft <b>helper</b> <b>springs.</b> A ''static'' rotation test was also performed to verify capability of the <b>helper</b> <b>springs</b> and to allow clearance measurements between the nose fairing and spacecraft envelope mock-up at certain discrete nose fairing rotation angles. Nose fairing trajectories, structural deflections, clearances, and hinge forces during jettison are presented. Data from subsequent Centaur D- 1 A flights, relative to nose fairing jettisons, are compared with the experimental results...|$|R
50|$|Utah State Route 157 (SR-157) is a {{state highway}} in Carbon County in the U.S. state of Utah. Spanning just over 5 mi, it connects <b>Helper</b> and <b>Spring</b> Glen with Kenilworth to the northeast.|$|R
50|$|The car has a {{top speed}} of 55 mph. There is a {{transmission}} brake operating on a 12.5 in drum fitted behind the gearbox operated by foot pedal and internal expanding 12 in drum brakes on the back axle operated by the handbrake lever. Suspension is by semi-elliptic leaf springs on both front and rear axles with an additional crossways <b>helper</b> <b>spring</b> on the rear. The axle is located by a triangular strut linking axle and chassis and the main drive thrust is transmitted to the car by links between the ends of the axle and forward spring brackets. By this means the springs are only responsible for suspension. Artillery type wheels with wooden spokes were fitted.|$|E
5000|$|More technically, [...] "suicide clutch" [...] {{can refer}} to clutch {{controls}} lacking a detent on the foot clutch, which would otherwise allow the rider to lock the clutch in the disengaged position. Early foot-clutch motorcycles, such as those from Harley-Davidson and Indian, allowed the rider to lock the clutch foot pedal due to its over-center geometry plus a <b>helper</b> <b>spring</b> (aka [...] "sissy spring"), so they could place both {{feet on the ground}} when stopped. These standard clutches are called a [...] "rocker clutch". If this device was disabled, or a custom foot clutch was installed that had no detent, it was referred to as a [...] "suicide clutch" [...] because stopping the motorcycle in-gear required the rider to keep his foot on the pedal. Should he lose his balance and put the left foot down, the motorcycle could lurch forward into cross traffic. The suicide clutch, especially on a chopper with no front brake, also made stopping at a red light on a hill especially precarious.|$|E
50|$|However, unlike today's {{electrically}} powered fuel injection systems, the 300 SL's mechanical fuel pump {{would continue to}} inject gasoline into the engine during the interval between shutting off the ignition and the engine's coming to a stop; this unburned gasoline washed lubricating oil from the cylinder walls, which not only left them unprotected in affected areas during start-up but would dilute the engine's entire oil supply if the car was not driven hard or long enough to reach a sufficient temperature to evaporate the gas out of the oil. To reduce this dilution by gasoline when stopping the engine, the owner's manual advised Turn the ignition key to the left while idling. Do not on any account {{try to stop the}} engine at a higher speed. Exacerbating the problem was the engine's large racing-oriented oil cooler and enormous 10 L oil capacity, which virtually guaranteed the oil would not get hot enough. In practice, many owners would block off airflow through the oil cooler and stick rigidly to the appropriately low 1000 mi recommended oil change interval. An auxiliary fuel pump provided additional fuel for extended high speed operation or cold starts; overuse would also lead to dilution of the oil., Clutch operation was initially very heavy, remedied by an improved clutch arm <b>helper</b> <b>spring</b> which reduced pedal force. From March 1963 to the end of production later that year, a light alloy crankcase was used on a total of 209 vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The route {{begins at}} US-6 south of <b>Helper</b> in <b>Spring</b> Glen as Spring Glen Road. Classified as a rural major collector, it crosses Spring Glen Creek as it heads north toward its {{northern}} terminus at SR-157, spanning {{a distance of}} 1.4 mi.|$|R
50|$|Adjacent to <b>Helper</b> was <b>Spring</b> Glen. It {{was first}} {{established}} in 1880, with Teancum Pratt {{being one of}} the first settlers. An LDS branch was organized there in 1885 with Francis Marion Ewell as president. It was made a ward in 1889. As of 1930 less than 20% of the population in Spring Glen was LDS.|$|R
50|$|The Atom’s {{suspension}} {{derives from}} single seat racing cars and is fully adjustable, requiring only a spanner/wrench. Both {{front and rear}} double unequal length wishbones and inboard, pushrod-operated dampers contribute to the Atom’s dynamic handling. Adjustable suspension rod ends feature inboard rubber/metal bushings to promote a more comfortable road-going ride. The front and rear Bilstein dampers are also adjustable. Stacked <b>helper</b> coil <b>springs</b> and main coil springs produce a low spring rate for minor deflections and a higher rate for large ones.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an industrial {{application of the}} analytical target cascading (ATC) methodology for the optimal design of commercial vehicle systems. It is the first milestone of a recently initiated research effort between Altair, Hyundai and the University of Michigan, {{whose objective is to}} develop and introduce a computational ATC tool platform into Hyundai's product development process so that the latter can be enhanced and streamlined. Two pilot studies are considered: the suspension design of a heavy-duty truck and the body structure design of a bus. An implementation novelty is the use of OptiStruct models for integrated analysis and optimization of the subproblems. The ATC results provide useful insight on the feasibility of system-level design targets and the adequacy of the subproblem design spaces.

50|$|State Route 157 was {{established}} in 1933 as connecting what was then SR-8 (now US-6) between <b>Helper</b> and <b>Spring</b> Glen with Kenilworth. In 1959, the route's west end was extended north to the former SR-244 in Helper. In 2013, SR-244 {{was removed from the}} State Highway System, but the section of the former state route along Poplar Street (from US-6/US-191 to South Main Street) was added to SR-157. The result is the current alignment of SR-157 (south from Helper to Kenilworth road, thence northeast to Kenilworth).|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{establishment}} of Spring Canyon, residents in Helper mined coal from a small opening {{on the side of the}} mountain. In 1895, Teancum Pratt constructed a wagon road in order to make coal transportation easier. In 1912, Jesse Knight purchased 1,600 acres of land west of <b>Helper,</b> organized the <b>Spring</b> Canyon Coal Company, and constructed sixty homes. Knight also constructed a railroad in 1913 to the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad line in Helper. Knight named the new town Storrs, after the mine superintendent George Storrs. Because Knight was a Mormon, he banned saloons and gambling houses from being constructed in the town. In 1914, a schoolhouse and a church were constructed for the townspeople, who were mostly members of the LDS Church. By the end of 1914, 1,000 tons of coal per day were being shipped.|$|R
40|$|On {{farms and}} {{in small towns}} across the Great Plains during the nineteenth century, hired girls were {{necessary}} domestic <b>helpers.</b> <b>Spring</b> planting and fall harvest compounded the normally heavy work load of farm women, and even in towns, housekeeping was labor intensive. Help with the daily chores was always welcome. As a result, hired girls were in keen demand and short supply. Despite their crucial role in housekeeping, hired girls have received little systematic attention from scholars. Social historians have recently displayed renewed interest in servants, but their works have focused on domestics in the urban East and have given scant consideration to hired girls in rural and small-town America. Little is known about these women: who they were and why they hired out. Novels and memoirs {{of the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries suggest answers to these questions. If they do not reveal precisely who these women were, they do at least tell us who people at the time thought they were. The purpose of this article is to examine, from a historical perspective, the image of the hired girl held by novelists and writers of memoirs, and to compare this image with what presentday historians have written about servants. Annette Atkins, Julie Roy Jeffrey, Sandra Myres, and Glenda Riley, among others, have exposed the dangers of treating novels about frontier women as historical fact. who then, in the eyes of contemporary writers, were the hired girls? Were they young or old, single or married? Had they been born in America or overseas? Were they black or white? How well educated were they? Why did they hire out? Did people perceive hired girls as fundamentally different from other females? DEMOGRAPHIC CHARACTERISTICS OF HIRED GIRLS Age is one of the most important demographic characteristics to consider. Those females identified specifically as 2 ̆ 2 hired girls 2 ̆ 2 in both novels and memoirs about the agrarian plains were invariably young, in their mid teens to early twenties. Girls who hired out in their midteens include Faye Lewis, who later wrote about her South Dakota childhood in Nothing to Make a Shadow, and suffragist Jessie Haver Butler. Susette, in Mari Sandoz 2 ̆ 7 s biography of her father, Old Jules, was in service at nineteen. The most detailed treatment of hired girls in the works under consideration is found in Willa Cather 2 ̆ 7 s My Àntonia. In this classic, Cather lovingly fictionalized the lives of those immigrant pioneers who settled the plains. One of these, the novelist 2 ̆ 7 s heroine, was the Bohemian Antonia Shimerda. Antonia worked as a field hand for three years before becoming a hired girl at seventeen. During her five years as a domestic, a number of her farm friends also moved to town seeking employment. Although Cather did not specify the ages of these secondary characters, it is clear from both the narrative and the context that they were also in their mid- to late teens. Cather suggested this in describing the girls physically and socially. First, the language used to portray them conveys the image of nascent sexuality. Lena Lingard, for example, caused a stir when she appeared in church dressed as a young lady. Until then, apparently no one had noticed the 2 ̆ 2 swelling lines of her figure... hidden under the shapeless rags she wore in the field. 2 ̆ 2 Similarly, Cather 2 ̆ 7 s narrator Jim Burden described the three Bohemian Marys as 2 ̆ 2 a menace to the social order 2 ̆ 2 for the same reason. Secondly, the hired girls clearly shared interests transcending their status as immigrants and working women. Cather, who used 2 ̆ 2 hired girl 2 ̆ 2 to refer to all wage-earning women except teachers, described the preoccupation of the hired girls with their social lives, clothes, and dancing in terms that approximate historian Leslie Tentler 2 ̆ 7 s depiction of the female urban workplace as an 2 ̆ 2 adolescent counterculture 2 ̆ 2 in which social relations assumed paramount importance...|$|R
