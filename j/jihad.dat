5|$|The <b>jihad</b> in Futa Jallon was {{followed}} by a <b>jihad</b> in Futa Toro between 1769 and 1776 led by Sileymaani Baal.|$|E
5|$|The <b>jihad</b> was {{launched}} around 1726 or 1727.|$|E
5|$|After bin Laden's death, it was {{reported}} he had left a will written a short time after the September 11 attacks in which he urged his children not to join al-Qaeda and not to continue the <b>Jihad.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{many years}} of conflict, Ibrahim Sori {{achieved}} a decisive victory in 1776 that consolidated {{the power of the}} Fulbe state. The <b>jihad</b> had achieved its goals and Ibrahim Sori assumed the title of almami.|$|E
5|$|Al-Wazir {{married his}} cousin Intissar al-Wazir in 1962 and had five {{children}} with her. They had three sons, named <b>Jihad,</b> Bassem and Nidal, and two daughters, named Iman and Hanan al-Wazir. Intissar {{and her children}} returned to Gaza following the Oslo Accords between Israel and the PLO and in 1996 {{she became the first}} female minister in the Palestinian National Authority. His son <b>Jihad</b> al-Wazir is currently the Governor of the Palestinian Monetary Authority.|$|E

5|$|Alfa Ba, Karamoko Alfa's father, {{formed a}} {{coalition}} of Muslim Fulbe and called for the <b>jihad</b> in 1725, but died before the struggle began. The <b>jihad</b> was launched around 1726-1727. After a crucial, concluding victory at Talansan, the state was established {{at a meeting of}} nine Fulbe ulama who each represented one of the Futa Jallon provinces. Ibrahima Sambeghu, who became known as Karamokho Alfa, was the hereditary ruler of Timbo and one of the nine ulama. He was elected leader of the <b>jihad.</b> Under his leadership, Futa Jallon became the first Muslim state to be founded by the Fulbe. Despite this, Karamokho Alfa was constrained by the other eight ulama. Some of the other Ulama had more secular power than Karamokho Alfa, who directly ruled only the diwal of Timbo; for this reason the new state was always a tenuous confederation. Karamoko Alfa ruled the theocratic state until 1748, when his excessive devotions caused him to become mentally unstable and Sori was selected as de facto leader. Karamokho Alfa died around 1751 and was formally succeeded by Ibrahim Sori, his cousin.|$|E

5|$|In 2017 {{the theory}} of {{evolution}} was removed from the national curriculum in favour of teaching on the concept of <b>jihad.</b>|$|E
5|$|The <b>jihad</b> also {{attracted}} some formerly non-Muslim Fulbe, who associated it {{not just with}} Islam but with freedom of the Fulbe from subordination to the Mandé peoples.|$|E
5|$|The <b>jihad</b> {{created a}} {{valuable}} supply of slaves from the defeated peoples {{that may have}} provided a motive for further conquests.|$|E
5|$|Wail and Waleed al-Shehri {{disappeared}} {{after going}} to Medina, calling their father just once; in the conversation, the brothers were vague {{about when they}} would return. Both had expressed interest in joining the <b>jihad</b> in Chechnya, though may have been diverted to Afghanistan. Before disappearing, the Shehri brothers went to Al-Seqley Mosque {{to swear an oath}} and commitment to <b>jihad,</b> as did Ahmed al-Nami and Saeed al-Ghamdi. Wail presided over the ceremony, dubbing himself Abu Mossaeb al-Janubi after one of Muhammad's companions.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 19th century, Usman dan Fodio directed a successful <b>jihad</b> and created and led the centralised Fulani Empire (also known as the Sokoto Caliphate). The territory controlled by the resultant state included much of modern-day northern and central Nigeria; it lasted until the 1903 break-up of the Empire into various European colonies.|$|E
5|$|Both King George V of England and Cosmo Gordon Lang the Bishop of Canterbury took a {{personal}} interest in the Assyrian affair. British representatives at home demanded from Faysal that Sidqi and other culprits be tried and punished. The massacres were seen in Europe as a <b>jihad</b> against a small Christian minority.|$|E
5|$|In June 1912, {{during one}} of his Friday prayer sermons, he called for volunteers to engage in a <b>jihad</b> against the Italians. Accepting only volunteers with prior Ottoman {{military}} training, al-Qassam enlisted dozens of volunteers and set up a fund for the expedition to Libya as well as a small pension for the families of volunteers while they were abroad. Although accounts vary, al-Qassam was accompanied by 60 to 250 volunteers known as mujahideen (those who engage in <b>jihad)</b> when he arrived in Alexandretta {{in the latter part of}} that year. Intending to gain sea transportation from the Ottomans, al-Qassam's request was rejected by the authorities who ordered him and his men back to Jableh. A new Ottoman government in Istanbul had gained power and shifted the state's focus to the Balkan front in October, abandoning the Libyan resistance. Part of the money that was raised was then used to establish a madrasa in Jableh while the remainder was saved for future efforts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 19th century, Modibo Adama led Fulani {{soldiers}} on a <b>jihad</b> {{in the north}} against non-Muslim and partially Muslim peoples and established the Adamawa Emirate. Settled peoples who fled the Fulani caused a major redistribution of population. The northern part of Cameroon was {{an important part of}} the Arab slave trade network.|$|E
5|$|Karamokho Alfa's {{maternal}} {{cousin was}} Maka Jiba, {{the ruler of}} Bundu, and both men studied in Fugumba under the famous scholar Tierno Samba. However, there are no records of Bundu participation in the Futa Jallon <b>jihad,</b> {{perhaps because of the}} internal troubles in Bundu at that time, or perhaps because Maka Jiba was not greatly interested in the cause.|$|E
5|$|On 18 January 2015, a {{group of}} Hezbollah fighters was {{targeted}} in Quneitra, with the Al-Nusra Front claiming responsibility. In this attack, for which Israel was also accused, <b>Jihad</b> Moghnieh, son of Imad Mughnieh, five other members of Hezbollah and an Iranian general of Quds Force, Mohammad Ali Allahdadi, were killed.|$|E
5|$|On August 20, 1985, Israel sent 96 American-made TOW {{missiles}} to Iran through an arms dealer Manucher Ghorbanifar. Subsequently, on September 14, 1985, 408 more TOW missiles were delivered. On September 15, 1985, following the second delivery, Reverend Benjamin Weir {{was released by}} his captors, the Islamic <b>Jihad</b> Organization.|$|E
5|$|The kidnappers demanded Christians {{contribute}} to the <b>jihad,</b> through jizya. The captors also demanded the release of Arab (non-Iraqi) detainees and that they be paid $3 million for Rahho's release. The kidnappers also demanded that Iraqi Christians form a militia to fight the US forces.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qaeda's second-in-command, al-Zawahiri, {{issued a}} {{videotape}} on 11 July 2007, calling for Pakistanis to join <b>jihad</b> in revenge {{for the attack}} by the Pakistan's Army on the mosque. Al-Zawahri's four-minute address was titled The Aggression against Lal Masjid and dedicated solely to the clash between the Lal Masjid militants and the Pakistan Army. The video was released by al-Qaeda's media wing, as-Sahab and subtitled in English.|$|E
5|$|As {{a symbol}} of the Caliph's ritual role {{as the leader of the}} Muslim community, they were closely paralleled in {{official}} propaganda by the leadership by Abbasid family members of the annual pilgrimage (hajj) to Mecca. In addition, the constant warfare on the Syrian marches was useful to the Abbasids as it provided employment for the Syrian and Iraqi military elites and the various volunteers (muṭṭawi‘a) who flocked to participate in the <b>jihad.</b>|$|E
5|$|By early 1985, Reagan's anti-communist {{position}} {{had developed}} into a stance known as the new Reagan Doctrinewhich, in addition to containment, formulated an additional right to subvert existing communist governments. Besides continuing Carter's policy of supporting the Islamic opponents of the Soviet Union and the Soviet-backed PDPA government in Afghanistan, the CIA also sought to weaken the Soviet Union itself by promoting Islamism in the majority-Muslim Central Asian Soviet Union. Additionally, the CIA encouraged anti-communist Pakistan's ISI to train Muslims {{from around the world}} to participate in the <b>jihad</b> against the Soviet Union.|$|E
5|$|Enver Pasha {{conceived}} {{an expedition}} to Afghanistan in 1914. He envisioned it as a pan-Islamic venture directed by Turkey, with some German participation. The German delegation to this expedition, chosen by Oppenheim and Zimmermann, included Oskar Niedermayer and Wilhelm Wassmuss. An escort of nearly a thousand Turkish troops and German advisers was to accompany the delegation through Persia into Afghanistan, where they hoped to rally local tribes to <b>jihad.</b>|$|E
5|$|Following {{the draft}} treaty of January 1916, apprehensions grew in Delhi of trouble from tribes in the North-West Frontier Province. That spring, Indian {{intelligence}} received rumours {{of letters from}} Habibullah to his tribal chiefs exhorting holy <b>jihad.</b> Alarmed, Hardinge called 3,000 tribal chiefs to a grand Jirga in Peshawar, where aerial bombing displays were held; Hardinge demonstrated the Empire's goodwill by increasing British subsidies to the chiefs. These measures helped convince the frontier tribes that Britain's wartime position remained strong and that Indian defences were impregnable.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the rapid}} Muslim conquests of the 7th century, the Byzantine Empire found itself {{confined}} to Asia Minor, the southern coasts of the Balkans, {{and parts of}} Italy. As Byzantium remained the Caliphate's major infidel enemy, Arab raids into Asia Minor continued throughout the 8th and 9th centuries. Over time, these expeditions, launched from bases in the Arab frontier zone on an almost annual basis, acquired a quasi-ritualized character {{as part of the}} Muslim <b>jihad</b> (holy war).|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah has a {{military}} branch {{known as the}} <b>Jihad</b> Council, one component of which is Al-Muqawama al-Islamiyya ("The Islamic Resistance"), and is the possible sponsor {{of a number of}} lesser-known militant groups, some of which may be little more than fronts for Hezbollah itself, including the Organization of the Oppressed, the Revolutionary Justice Organization, the Organization of Right Against Wrong, and Followers of the Prophet Muhammad.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{parallelism}} and {{the tradition}} of drawing inspiration from the Middle Ages have become keystones of Islamic ideology. Secular Arab Nationalism concentrates {{on the idea of}} Western Imperialism. Gamal Abdel Nasser likened himself to Saladin and imperialism to the Crusades. In his History of the Crusades Sa'id Ashur emphasised the similarity between the modern and medieval situation facing Muslims and the need to study the Crusades in depth. Sayyid Qutb declared there was an international Crusader conspiracy. The ideas of <b>Jihad</b> and a long struggle have developed some currency.|$|E
5|$|In November, the Indian members {{decided to}} take a {{political}} initiative which they believed would convince the Emir to declare <b>jihad,</b> and if that proved unlikely, to have his hand forced by his advisors. On 1 December 1915, the Provisional Government of India was founded at Habibullah's Bagh-e-Babur Palace, {{in the presence of the}} Indian, German, and Turkish members of the expedition. This revolutionary government-in-exile was to take charge of an independent India when the British authority had been overthrown. Mahendra Pratap was proclaimed president, Barkatullah the prime minister, the Deobandi leader Maulana Ubaidullah Sindhi the minister for India, Maulavi Bashir the war minister, and Champakaran Pillai the foreign minister. Support was obtained from Galib Pasha for proclaiming <b>jihad</b> against Britain, while recognition was sought from Russia, Republican China, and Japan. After the February Revolution in Russia in 1917, Pratap's government corresponded with the nascent Bolshevik government in an attempt to gain their support. In 1918, Mahendra Pratap met Trotsky in Petrograd before meeting the Kaiser in Berlin, urging both to mobilise against British India.|$|E
5|$|Once at war, Turkey joined Germany {{in taking}} aim at the {{opposing}} Entente Powers and their extensive empires in the Muslim world. Enver Pasha had the Sultan proclaim <b>jihad.</b> His hope was to provoke and aid a vast Muslim revolution, particularly in India. Translations of the proclamation were sent to Berlin for propaganda purposes, for distribution to Muslim troops of the Entente Powers. However, while widely heard, the proclamation {{did not have the}} intended effect of mobilising global Muslim opinion on behalf of Turkey or the Central Powers.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic <b>Jihad</b> (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new tactic of suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|There was {{violence}} in the Netherlands and in Norway: the Chinese embassy in the Netherlands was attacked by Uyghur activists who smashed windows with bricks, the Chinese flag was also burnt. There were 142 arrests, and China closed the embassy for the day. About 100 Uyghurs protested outside the Chinese embassy in the Norwegian capital. Eleven were detained, and later released without charge. Protesters from a coalition of Indonesian Islamist groups attacked guards at the Chinese embassy in Jakarta {{and called for a}} <b>jihad</b> against China.|$|E
5|$|Hezbollah {{says that}} its {{continued}} hostilities against Israel are justified as reciprocal to Israeli operations against Lebanon and as retaliation {{for what they}} claim is Israel's occupation of Lebanese territory. Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 2000, and their withdrawal was verified by the United Nations as being in accordance with resolution 425 of 19 March 1978, however Lebanon considers the Shebaa farms—a 26-km² (10-mi²) piece of land captured by Israel from Syria in the 1967 war and considered by the UN to be Syrian territory occupied by Israel—to be Lebanese territory. Additionally, Hezbollah claims that three Lebanese prisoners are being held in Israel. Finally, Hezbollah consider Israel to be an illegitimate state. For these reasons, they justify their actions as acts of defensive <b>jihad.</b>|$|E
5|$|In 1930 or 1931, al-Qassam had {{recruited}} numerous hand-picked {{followers and}} organized them into {{about a dozen}} different circles, each group of supporters unaware {{of the existence of}} the other groups. The majority of his men were peasants and urban laborers. The majority of al-Qassam's circles were based in northern Palestine, but he had disciples throughout the country, including in Gaza in the south. In contrast to traditional Palestinian leaders who campaigned against Zionist settlement while avoiding confrontation with the British authorities, al-Qassam saw it as a priority to fight against both. He also saw the brewing conflict in Palestine as a religious struggle, unlike most Palestinian leaders who advocated a secular and nationalist response. Al-Qassam advocated a moral, political and military <b>jihad</b> as the solution to end British rule and Zionist aspirations in Palestine.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the perceived blasphemy, Akhtar declared it was his personal <b>jihad</b> to find {{those responsible for the}} packaging and destroy their professional status, personal life and the UK as a whole for having a culture allowing the insult to occur. This event, Akhtar's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics, such as James Joyner, claiming that western nations and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims' claims or threats and by commentators, including author Daniel C. Dennett, highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s the French {{controlled}} {{only the}} northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 Abd al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring <b>jihad</b> against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, Abd al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced Abd al-Kader's surrender in 1847.|$|E
