40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the effect of}} working hours on energy use and greenhouse gas emissions from private consumption. Time use and consumption patterns of Swedish households are analysed to estimate the effects of changing income and availability of leisure time. The results indicate that a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> by 1 % may reduce energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by about 0. 7 % and 0. 8 %, respectively. These results are {{mainly because of the}} effects of lower income and lower consumption. The partly offsetting effect of households having more time available for leisure activities is less than a tenth of the income effect. In a sketched scenario we also elaborate on the long-term impacts of a work time reduction. A gradual reduction towards a 30 -hour working week in 2040 would result in a significantly slower growth of energy demand, which would also make it easier to reach climate targets...|$|E
40|$|The paper investigates {{whether a}} <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> {{standard}} <b>working</b> <b>time</b> (the stipulated weekly <b>working</b> <b>time)</b> might produce work-sharing, i. e. a redistribution {{of a given}} amount of work over {{a larger number of}} employees. To this end, we adopt a structural vector error correction model thought to be representative of the main effects that working hours have on output, employment and wages in Germany and the US. Impulse response analysis suggests that permanent negative shocks to working hours lead to: (i) a <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> the real GDP, (ii) a significant fall in real wages, and (iii) a persistent <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> employment. More interestingly, results obtained from error-variance decomposition show that employment movements are not driven by working hours and that weekly hour shocks account for a minimal portion of employment and output dynamics. The main policy result emerging from the empirical analysis suggests that the implementation of work-sharing programs has not clear beneficial effects on the labour market performances...|$|R

Taking into account omitted variables and reverse causality, we show that the <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> capital across <b>time</b> leads to increasing performance. This relationship is driven by firms that have substantial cash unnecessarily tied up <b>in</b> <b>working</b> capital. Importantly, we also show that corporate investment is the channel through which improvement in WCM translates into superior performance. Finally, the value effect of WCM is attenuated during the financial crisis, due to the contraction of the investment opportunity set. JEL classification: G 31, G 3...|$|R
40|$|Background : Surgical {{residents}} {{used to work}} many hours. The European <b>working</b> <b>time</b> directive (EWTD) 2003 / 88 /EG {{was created}} to protect young doctors from working too many hours. EWTD was implemented in Belgium on February 1 st 2011. A <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours and improvement of surgical education was expected. Methods : Every resident was requested by the Faculty of Medicine to answer an ACC (Activities Coaching Context) questionnaire about his/her teaching hospital. The answers of surgical residents in all teaching hospitals, during the academic years before, {{during and after the}} implementation of the EWTD were used. Statistical analysis was performed with SPSS 20. Results : Since implementation we noted a significant <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> mean daily <b>working</b> <b>time</b> (MDWT) (p < 0, 001). However, this MDWT stayed significantly longer in university hospitals (UH), even after implementation of EWTD (p = 0, 024). Non-medical administrative workload (AW) did not change significantly (p = 0, 531), but medical AW increased significantly after implementation (p = 0, 050). Non-medical and medical AW were significantly higher in UH after implementation (p = 0, 002 and p < 0, 001). The opportunity to practice skills and also the perception of a good balance between working and learning did not change significantly after implementation (p = 0, 200 and p = 0, 819), but both were scored significantly better in non-UH (p < 0, 001 and p = 0, 052) regardless implementation of EWTD. Conclusions : Since implementation of EWTD there is a significant <b>decrease</b> <b>in</b> MDWT. However, AW has not decreased and is higher in UH. The main challenge for future surgical education will be to reduce AW in order to give surgical residents enough opportunities to practice their surgical skills without prolonging training time. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Using {{data from}} the German Socio-Economic Panel Study (SOEP, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, and 2011), the author scrutinizes the {{relations}} between women 4 s and men 4 s flexibility and autonomy <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and two central work outcomes: overtime and income. Previously, research on flexibility and autonomy <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> mostly applied crosssectional data ignoring individuals self-selection into jobs. Furthermore, the association between flexibility and autonomy <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and income has generally been neglected. Extending this literature, fixedeffects models show that flexible <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy are associated with an increase of overtime and income - but only for men. Whereas women in fulltime positions also increase their <b>time</b> investment with <b>working</b> <b>time</b> autonomy and employeeoriented flexibility to a similar extent, they do not receive similar financial rewards. These results point to gendered {{costs and benefits of}} <b>working</b> <b>time</b> flexibility and autonomy. Working time autonomy in particular is a crucial factor that reinforces gender inequality at the workplace and adds to the relatively high gender pay gap in Germany...|$|R

We use the 1970 and 1997 Current Population Surveys to investigate the distribution of working hours across dual-earner couples and single parents. Our findings demonstrate that the shift from male-breadwinner to dual-earner couples and single-parent households, rather than changes in the length of the workweek per se, have created growing concern for balancing work and family. This analysis suggests that debates over conflicts between work and family need to focus more on the combined work schedules of family members than on changes in individual work patterns...|$|R

40|$|The paper studies {{wage and}} {{employment}} determination in the Swedish business sector from the mid- 1910 s {{to the late}} 1930 s. This period includes the {{boom and bust cycle}} of the early 1920 s as well as the Great Depression of the early 1930 s. The events of the early 1920 s are particularly intriguing, involving inflation running {{at an annual rate of}} 30 percent followed by a period of sharp deflation where nominal wages and prices fell by 30 percent and unemployment increased from 5 to 30 percent. We examine whether relatively standard wage and employment equations can account for the volatile economic development during the interwar years. By and large, the answer is a qualified yes. Industry wages were responsive to industry-specific firm performance, suggesting a significant role for “insider forces” in wage determination. Unemployment had a strong downward impact on wages.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} three trends <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the United States {{over the}} last thirty years.

An international comparison also shows that the United States stands out as having among {{the highest percentage of}} workers putting in 50 hours per week or more. Second, we argue that there is a mismatch between <b>working</b> <b>time</b> and the preferences of American workers. On average, those working very long hours express a desire to work less, while those working short hours prefer to work more. Third, we maintain that the sense of being overworked stems primarily from demographic shifts in the labor force rather than from changes <b>in</b> average <b>working</b> <b>time</b> per se. Even {{in the absence of a}} dramatic rise in time spent on the job, the growth in the proportion of American households consisting of dual-earner couples and single parents has created a growing percentage of workers who face heightened time pressures and increased conflicts between work and their private lives. <b>working</b> <b>time,</b> work-family conflict, over work, under work, dualearners, time famine,...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of our analysis {{is to find}} out whether an increase <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> without pay compensation can be considered an adequate policy to reduce unemployment. From the perspective of economic theory the outcome is in general ambiguous: On the one hand, as the increase <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> raises labour productivity per employee, conditional demand for labour will increase (substitution effect) and conditional demand for intermediate inputs will decline. Since, on the other hand, workers do have a longer <b>working</b> <b>time</b> anyway, no positive effect on the number of persons employed can be expected. However, output of the manufacturing industry, and thus unconditional demand for labour, capital and intermediate goods, will increase (output effect). In order to sell the additional output, firms have to lower prices. Depending on the price elasticities, revenues and hence profits will change. We quantify the employment effects of an economy-wide increase in weekly normal hours in Germany {{on the basis of a}} CGE model using an input-output framework for all sectors of the economy. Our simulation results support the argument of the opponents of longer <b>working</b> <b>time</b> that not more jobs will be created. However, when we recycled the higher tax revenues from GDP growth to lower the contribution to social security, then we have been able to support the claim of the proponents that more jobs will be created.

As a result, the relation between hourly wages and <b>working</b> <b>time</b> {{is likely to be}} U-shaped. The level of <b>working</b> <b>time</b> where {{the impact of}} hours on hourly wages changes sign, is typically higher than the individual hours supply, unless the latter is strongly upward sloping. Extending these partial equilibrium results to the general equilibrium, this also leads to a U- shaped relation between equilibrium unemployment and working time: For relatively long <b>working</b> <b>times,</b> a reduction <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> will <b>decrease</b> the unemployment rate; whereas unemployment may increase for shorter <b>working</b> <b>times.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|A {{reduction}} <b>in</b> <b>working</b> {{hours is}} being considered to tackle {{issues associated with}} ecological sustainability, social equity and enhanced life satisfaction - a so-called triple dividend. With respect to an environmental dividend, the authors analyse the time use rebound effects of reducing <b>working</b> <b>time.</b> They explore how an increase in leisure time triggers a rearrangement of time and expenditure budgets, and thus the use of resources in private households. Does it hold true that time-intensive activities replace resource-intensive consumption when people have more discretionary time at their disposal? This study on environmental issues is complemented by introducing the parameters of voluntary social engagement and individual life satisfaction as potential co-benefits of rebound effects. In order to analyse the first dividend, a mixed methods approach is adopted, enabling two models of time use rebound effects to be applied. First, semi-standardised interviews reveal that environmentally ambiguous substitutions of activities occur following a reduction <b>in</b> <b>working</b> hours. Second, estimates for Germany from national surveys on time use and expenditure show composition effects of gains in leisure time and income loss. For the latter, we estimate the marginal propensity to consume and the marginal propensity to time use. The results show that time savings due to a reduction <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> trigger relevant rebound effects in terms of resource use. However, both the qualitative and quantitative findings put the rebound effects following a reduction <b>in</b> <b>working</b> <b>time</b> into perspective.
