5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used for evaluating weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The yearlong {{conversion}} began October 9, 2011. Between October and December, 96 of Jaguar's 200 cabinets, each containing 24 XT5 blades (two 6-core CPUs per node, four nodes per blade), were {{upgraded to}} XK7 blades (one 16-core CPU per node, four nodes per blade) while {{the remainder of}} the machine remained in use. In December, computation was moved to the 96 XK7 cabinets while the remaining 104 cabinets were upgraded to XK7 blades. ORNL's external ESnet connection was upgraded from 10 Gbit/s to 100 Gbit/s and the system interconnect (the network over which CPUs communicate with each other) was updated. The Seastar design used in Jaguar was upgraded to the Gemini interconnect used in Titan which connects the nodes into a direct 3D torus interconnect network. Gemini uses wormhole <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> internally. The system memory was doubled to 584 TiB. 960 of the XK7 nodes (10 cabinets) were fitted with a Fermi based GPU as Kepler GPUs were not then available; these 960 nodes were referred to as TitanDev and used to test code. This first phase of the upgrade increased the peak performance of Jaguar to 3.3 petaFLOPS. Beginning on September 13, 2012, Nvidia K20X GPUs were fitted to all of Jaguar's XK7 compute blades, including the 960 TitanDev nodes. In October, the task was completed and the computer was finally christened Titan.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> graph {{represents}} all the <b>flows</b> of <b>control</b> {{that may}} arise during program execution. Since exception mechanism in Java induces <b>flows</b> of <b>control,</b> exception induced <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> {{have to be}} incorporated in <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> graph. In the previous research to construct <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> graph, they compute exception flow and normal flow {{at the same time}} while computing <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> information. In this paper, we propose a method to construct <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> graph by computing separately normal flow and exception flow. We show that normal flow and exception flow can be safely decoupled, hence these two flows can be computed separately. We propose the analysis that estimates exception-induced <b>control</b> <b>flow,</b> and also propose exception flow graph that represents exception induced <b>control</b> <b>flows.</b> We show that a <b>control</b> <b>flow</b> graph can be constructed by merging an exception flow graph onto a normal flow graph...|$|R

In this use, active <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> promises lower mass, costs (up to 50% less), and very low inertia and response times, and simplicity.

Each pump has a <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> valve and a backflow preventing check valve on the outlet, and shutoff valves on both inlet and outlet.

25|$|In constant-flow {{regulators}} {{the first}} stage is a pressure regulator providing a constant reduced pressure, and the second stage is a plain on/off valve. These are the earliest type of breathing set <b>flow</b> <b>control.</b> The diver must open and close the supply valve to regulate flow. Constant flow valves in an open circuit breathing set consume gas less economically than demand valve regulators because gas flows {{even when it is}} not needed. Before 1939, diving and industrial open circuit breathing sets with constant-flow regulators were designed by Le Prieur, but did not get into general use due to very short dive duration. Design complications resulted from the need to put the second-stage <b>flow</b> <b>control</b> valve where it could be easily operated by the diver.|$|E
