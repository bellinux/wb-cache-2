"Power is {{predicated}} of God not as something really distinct from His <b>knowledge</b> and <b>will,</b> but as differing from them logically; inasmuch as power implies {{a notion of}} a principle putting into execution what the will commands, and what knowledge directs, which three things in God are identified. Or we may say, that the <b>knowledge</b> or <b>will</b> of God, according {{as it is the}} effective principle, has the notion of power contained in it.

25|$|According to {{theories}} of postmodernity, economic and technological conditions {{of our age}} {{have given rise to}} a decentralized, media-dominated society in which ideas are only simulacra, inter-referential representations and copies of each other with no real, original, stable or objective source of communication and meaning. Globalization, brought on by innovations in communication, manufacturing and transportation, is often cited as one force which has driven the decentralized modern life, creating a culturally pluralistic and interconnected global society lacking any single dominant center of political power, communication or intellectual production. The postmodernist view is that inter-subjective, not objective, <b>knowledge</b> <b>will</b> be the dominant form of discourse under such conditions and that ubiquity of dissemination fundamentally alters the relationship between reader and that which is read, between observer and the observed, between those who consume and those who produce.|$|E

These enable one to deliver powerful blows and to move with extreme precision and speed. The basic principle behind it is that, as Farad'n of House Corrino says, [...] "My mind affects my reality." [...] A practitioner of the art has to know that the action he or she [...] "wants" [...] to perform has already been performed.

Accordingly, RubisCO is called enolase-phosphglycerase (EPGase) since it is neither carboxylase nor oxygenase.|$|E
2500|$|In The Naked Sun, Elijah Baley {{points out}} that the Laws had been {{deliberately}} misrepresented because robots could unknowingly break any of them. He restated the first law as [...] "A robot may do nothing that, to its <b>knowledge,</b> <b>will</b> harm a human being; nor, through inaction, knowingly allow a human being to come to harm." [...] This change in wording makes it clear that robots can become the tools of murder, provided they not be aware of the nature of their tasks; for instance being ordered to add something to a person's food, not knowing that it is poison. Furthermore, he {{points out that}} a clever criminal could divide a task among multiple robots so that no individual robot could recognize that its actions would lead to harming a human being. The Naked Sun complicates the issue by portraying a decentralized, planetwide communication network among Solaria's millions of robots meaning that the criminal mastermind could be located anywhere on the planet.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{development}} of co-management regimes and increased Aboriginal participation in the wildlife policy process, the colonial legacy of the state management era still lingers. These current bison conservation initiatives do not discuss Aboriginal use of subsistence resources in national parks and reserves. It is unclear whether Aboriginal participation and Traditional Ecological <b>Knowledge</b> <b>will</b> be incorporated into reintroduction plans. Although the Cree and Dene are now recognized as official participants {{in the management of}} wildlife and protected areas, Sandlos argues that this [...] "tentative shift in political power represents an incomplete attempt to decolonize wildlife management practices in the North." [...] The weak powers given to Aboriginal people on wildlife advisory boards allow the state to maintain political authority over wildlife resources, while giving the appearance of a participatory consensus-building approach with Aboriginal hunters. Sandlos suggests that the advisory nature of co-management boards is based on the implicit colonial assumption that local Aboriginal resource management systems are deficient, and that {{the role of the state}} is essential to the formation of wildlife policy in Canada's north.|$|E

2500|$|The forgetting curve orientates {{itself on}} the typical forgetting curve by Ebbinghaus. He said that already after a very short amount of time, a forgetting process sets in immediately, stabilizes and then levels off. Bahrick {{conducted}} a study where he tested 773 persons with Spanish as their L2. His probates had varying acquisition and incubation periods, up to 50 years of non-active learning. He discovered a heavy attrition within the first 5 years, which then stabilized for the next 20 years (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130). According to Bahrick, the knowledge that remained after 5 years is stored in the permastore. Neisser (1984) uses a different term, he prefers critical threshold, a level {{that has to be}} reached. Beyond that threshold, <b>knowledge</b> <b>will</b> resist decay. Contrary to these findings Weltens & Cohen (1989: 130) are reporting from studies where different results were found. According to these findings, the forgetting curve begins with an initial plateau, a period where the language competence is not affected at all. This is then followed by the onset of attrition. Weltens explains these results: it is by the high proficiency of the probates (bilinguals and immersion students). However, it is still unknown whether the curve that follows this plateau is potentially exactly like the [...] "normal" [...] forgetting curve of language learners with a lower proficiency level (Weltens & Cohen 1989: 130).|$|E
2500|$|The queer theorist Robert McRuer {{compared}} The Sexual Brain to {{the political}} scientist Charles Murray and the psychologist Richard Herrnstein's The Bell Curve (1994), arguing that just as Murray and Herrnstein presented inequality as inevitable rather than the consequence of economic institutions that could be changed, LeVay failed to question the institution of heterosexuality. The biologist Steven Rose criticized the publicity that surrounded the publication of LeVay's book, arguing that LeVay over-stated the importance of his findings, behavior which Rose considered {{similar to that of}} Dean Hamer and other researchers. Bruce Thornton questioned the value of LeVay's work, writing that while LeVay asserted that the future would bring progress in understanding the development of sexuality, this begs [...] "the question of just how much good this <b>knowledge</b> <b>will</b> bring us when we are storm-tossed on the sea of eros." [...] The psychiatrist and medical historian Vernon Rosario criticized LeVay for his biological determinism and reductionism. The philosopher Edward Stein, writing in The Mismeasure of Desire (1999), criticized LeVay for failing to discuss social constructionism despite its relevance to his topic. The anthropologist Melvin Konner wrote that LeVay's book is an [...] "excellent brief introduction to the biology of gender" [...] and [...] "makes a graceful, excellent starting point" [...] for understanding the neuroscience of sexual arousal and associated behaviors. Louis A. Berman wrote that LeVay erroneously minimizes the role of experience in becoming an effective male partner in heterosexual intercourse.|$|E
