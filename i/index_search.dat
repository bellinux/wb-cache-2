40|$|Purpose - The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} various issues related to Chinese language localisation in Evergreen, an open source integrated library system (ILS). Design/methodology/approach - A Simplified Chinese version of Evergreen was implemented and tested and various issues such as encoding, <b>indexing,</b> <b>searching,</b> and sorting specifically associated with Simplified Chinese language were investigated. Findings - The paper finds that Unicode eases a lot of ILS development problems. However, having another language version of an ILS does not simply require the translation from one language to another. <b>Indexing,</b> <b>searching,</b> sorting and other locale related issues should be tackled not only language by language, but locale by locale. Practical implications - Most of the issues that have arisen during this project will be found with other ILS-like systems. Originality/value - This paper provides insights into issues of, and various solutions to, <b>indexing,</b> <b>searching,</b> and sorting in the Chinese language in an ILS. These issues and the solutions may be applicable to other digital library systems such as institutional repositories...|$|R
5000|$|Though the [...] {{element is}} {{deprecated}} and most browsers no longer support or render it, {{there are still}} some vestiges of <b>indexed</b> <b>search</b> in existence. For example, this {{is the source of the}} special handling of plus sign, '' within browser URL percent encoding (which today, with the deprecation of <b>indexed</b> <b>search,</b> is all but redundant with [...] ). Also some web servers supporting CGI (e.g., Apache) will process the query string into command line arguments if it does not contain an equals sign, '' (as per section 4.4 of CGI 1.1). Some CGI scripts still depend on and use this historic behavior for URLs embedded in HTML.|$|R

50|$|The {{control track}} {{is also used}} to hold index marks, which were {{normally}} written {{at the beginning of each}} recording session, and can be found using the VCR's <b>index</b> <b>search</b> function: this will fast-wind forward or backward to the nth specified index mark, and resume playback from there. At times, higher-end VCRs provided functions for the user to manually add and remove these marks — so that, for example, they coincide with the actual start of the television program — but this feature later became hard to find.|$|E
50|$|The {{technology}} used {{would have been}} a combination of electromechanical controls, microfilm cameras and readers, all integrated into a large desk. Most of the microfilm library would have been contained within the desk, but the user could add or remove microfilm reels at will. A memex would hypothetically read and write content on these microfilm reels, using electric photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the memex to <b>index,</b> <b>search,</b> and link content to create and follow associative trails.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe {{introduce}} a novel alphabet sampling technique for speeding up both online and indexed string matching. We choose {{a subset of}} the alphabet and extract the corresponding subsequence of the text. Online or <b>indexed</b> <b>searching</b> is then carried out on the extracted subsequence, and candidate matches are verified in the full text. We show that this speeds up online searching, especially for moderate to long patterns, by a factor of up to 5, while using 14 % extra space in our experiments. For <b>indexed</b> <b>searching</b> we achieve <b>indexes</b> that are as fast as the classical suffix array, yet occupy less than 50 % extra space (instead of the usual 400 %). Our experiments show no competitive alternatives exist in a wide space/time range...|$|R
5000|$|Some SQL {{products}} do not index keys containing NULLs. For instance, PostgreSQL versions {{prior to}} 8.3 did not, with the documentation for a B-tree index stating that B-trees can handle equality and range queries on data {{that can be}} sorted into some ordering. In particular, the PostgreSQL query planner will consider using a B-tree index whenever an indexed column {{is involved in a}} comparison using one of these operators: < ≤ [...] ≥ >Constructs equivalent to combinations of these operators, such as BETWEEN and IN, can also be implemented with a B-tree <b>index</b> <b>search.</b> (But note that IS NULL is not equivalent to [...] and is not indexable.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In 1945, Vannevar Bush {{wrote an}} article in The Atlantic Monthly called [...] "As We May Think", about a futuristic proto-hypertext device he called a Memex. A Memex would hypothetically store - and record - content on reels of microfilm, using {{electric}} photocells to read coded symbols recorded next to individual microfilm frames while the reels spun at high speed, stopping on command. The coded symbols would enable the Memex to <b>index,</b> <b>search,</b> and link content to create and follow associative trails. Because the Memex was never implemented and could only link content in a relatively crude fashion — by creating chains of entire microfilm frames — the Memex is now regarded only as a proto-hypertext device, but it is fundamental {{to the history of}} hypertext because it directly inspired the invention of hypertext by Ted Nelson and Douglas Engelbart.|$|E
5000|$|Of his {{numerous}} publications, {{there are}} two that stand out {{in terms of their}} influence on the discipline of epidemiology, the seminal 1985 article [...] "Sick Individuals and Sick Populations" [...] and his 1992 book [...] "The Strategy of Preventive Medicine". The impact goes beyond the field of epidemiology and into that of public health generally. One publication claimed that [...] "A casual Social Sciences Citation <b>Index</b> <b>search</b> yielded over 700 citations of this work". As S Schwartz and AV Diez-Roux pointed out, the central lesson that has been integrated into the aforementioned fields is that [...] "a large number of people at a small risk may give rise to more cases of disease than the small number who are at high risk". It was their assertion that this insight of Rose has profound implications for intervention and prevention strategies, and has been incorporated into research contexts through an understanding of the difference between measures of absolute and relative risk.|$|E
