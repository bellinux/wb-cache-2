500|$|Morty {{shares the}} {{reflected}} glory by remembering his own greatest moment; he is sympathetic, but Helen reminds {{them that they}} are all going to the 50th-anniversary dinner of Helen's second cousin Manya (Rozsika Halmos) and her husband Isaac (David Fresco). Though Jerry does not want to go—he has made plans, he doesn't know the people—his mother coerces him: [...] "At least come and say hello, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> then you'll leave." [...] Jerry knows it won't be that simple, so he persuades Elaine to attend, too. (To their unspoken dismay, she is seated at the kiddie table, lower than the grown-ups.) ...|$|E
2500|$|In the 2000s, major renovations {{were made}} to the Mahane Yehuda Market, {{including}} infrastructure work, repaving roads and covering some open areas. [...] The market's Board of Directors worked to make at least some of these changes in response to a decrease in visitors after terrorist attacks in 1997 and 2002 killed 23 people. Changes driven by the Board included renovations to the streets and alleyways, but also included efforts to draw in cafes and boutiques that would entice more middle-class customers who might become frequent shoppers. According to Eli Mizrachi, chairman of the Mahane Yehuda Merchants Association, whereas shoppers used to come to buy produce, the [...] "new generation" [...] wants a place with entertainment, a place to sit and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and a place to shop for gifts.|$|E

6000|$|... "Come in and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea or <b>a</b> {{glass of}} rum, {{whichever}} you like best. As you say, {{the wind is}} bitter cold, and I thought that I would land and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea. I shall catch the barge up before she gets to Pitsea." ...|$|R

2500|$|... “Suppose he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> {{coffee with}} them 12 months ago, {{is that all}} {{association}} means?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{think you}} had better turn in now, Wyatt. Will you come across and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> with me before you start?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At what hour?" [...] inquired Ned--"oh! seven o'clock; well, we can stroll {{back to the}} hotel, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> {{and bring}} Larry O'Neil with us. Come along." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Indeed you had, boy. Bother poets, and the {{day they}} first began to breed in Whitbury! Such an evening spoilt! <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee?</b> No? then a glass of sherry?" ...|$|E

60|$|The baker {{put down}} his hat, unwound his long woollen comforter, took off his overcoat, and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea.|$|R
50|$|An {{imaginary}} journey thorough {{the senses}} <b>of</b> <b>a</b> man <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> coffee. Transported by {{the taste of}} coffee, he faces himself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And ask for {{anything}} you like, my dear. A {{glass of wine}} or a cup of coffee; Judith will get you one in a moment. Won't you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> Mary, my dear?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, my dear young ladies, {{remember}} what your ma said, and don't fret. Come and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> all round, and then let's fall {{to work and}} be a credit to the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Somewhat. A little. But we'll catch up." [...] Sherikov retreated {{toward the}} door. [...] "Let's {{go down to}} the {{cafeteria}} and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> You worry too much, Commissioner. Take things more in your stride." ...|$|E
60|$|Ralph did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea {{given to}} him in the drawing-room, and then left the villa before Clarissa's fly had returned.|$|R
60|$|When I <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> {{coffee and}} some toast which Mary brought to me upon a tray, I arose from my chair.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, Eddy, don't talk nonsense. You know I {{mean the}} very poor, the destitute. But {{let us go}} up-stairs and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have got}} eightpence," [...] he said. [...] "That is {{something}} like luck. I got three jobs. One stood me fourpence, the other two gave me tuppence each. What do yer say? Shall we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> afore we turns in?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Look here, Smith,' he said, 'I want {{to speak}} to you. I'm {{in a bit of a}} hole, and perhaps you can tell me what to do. Let's go out and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> shall we? I can't tell you about it here.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{dare say}} you will make it even some time, Bill; so don't let's say {{anything}} more about it, but put on your clothes. We will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> each and a loaf between us for breakfast, {{and then we will}} go for a walk into the park, the same as we did last Sunday, and hear the preaching." ...|$|E

60|$|Mr. George {{began to}} {{perceive}} {{by this time}} that his principles of logic and those of Margaret were so entirely {{different from each other}} that there was no possibility of bringing any discussion to a point; and he very wisely gave up the contest, telling Margaret that she might let them <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and any thing else she pleased.|$|E
60|$|AUGUSTUS. I did {{not know}} that I was talking to an imbecile. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. There must be an end of this drunken slacking. I'm going to {{establish}} a new order of things here. I shall come down every morning before breakfast until things are properly in train. <b>Have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee</b> and two rolls for me here every morning at half-past ten.|$|E
60|$|Colby {{came around}} next morning just as Mr. Merrick was {{entering}} the breakfast room, {{and the little}} man took the lawyer in to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee.</b> The young attorney still maintained his jaunty air, although red-eyed from his night's vigil, {{and when he saw}} the Stanton girls and their Aunt Jane having breakfast by an open window he eagerly begged permission to join them, somewhat to Uncle John's amusement.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I’m not," [...] said Annis. [...] "I {{just stayed}} and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea with Miss Grattan. Mother has gone out, so I didn’t hurry." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Please, sir, 'e wouldn't <b>'ave</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea, sir," [...] {{she replied}} meekly, then, with a gleam {{of hope in}} her eyes--"Will you 'ave one, sir?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I've {{been sent}} to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea. Sir Arthur is coming along in a minute. I've got some news. I'm staying in Egypt. Isn't it splendid? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Awfully good of you, sir," [...] {{the young}} man declared, [...] "and I am sure we are very sorry to trouble you. In a week or two's time {{you can go into}} {{business}} again as much as you like. It's only while we are fiddling around here that the Admiral's jumpy about things. May my man <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> sir? I'd like to be on the way back in a quarter of an hour." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{is to come}} {{at seven}} o'clock in the morning. You <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> and some bread and butter and fruit, before that. He will go at nine, then we have breakfast. Then you will have your time to yourself, till dinner at half past two. The {{assistant}} surgeon of our regiment--he is a Dublin man--will come to you for Latin, and what I may call general knowledge, for two hours. That is all; except, I suppose, that you will work a bit by yourself, of an evening.|$|E
60|$|About {{this time}} Margaret {{came in and}} spread the cloth for breakfast. Soon {{afterwards}} she brought the breakfast up. She, however, brought only one cup for the coffee, having taken Mr. George's order, to let them <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> <b>coffee,</b> somewhat too literally. The truth is, that inasmuch as, at the English lodging houses, every thing that is called for is charged separately, the servants are, very properly, quite careful not to bring any thing unless it is distinctly ordered, lest they might seem to wish to force upon the traveller more than he desired to pay for.|$|E
60|$|Sadly they {{returned}} to the shore, and there the missionary, being near his house, invited Captain Bream to go home with him and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I'll {{tell you}} what, miss, you must help me eat it. I'll put the kettle on and we'll <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> tea. How will that do?" ...|$|R
50|$|Norbert is {{an alien}} from Jupiter who is {{certainly}} not afraid to speak his mind. He <b>has</b> <b>a</b> girlfriend called Nerissa and loves to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>cup</b> <b>of</b> cocoa.|$|R
