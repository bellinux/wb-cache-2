40|$|With {{a view to}} {{understand}} the whirl flutter phenomenon in flapped blade rotor systems and also to shed some light in bridging the existing gap between theoretical and experimental results, the equations of motion of an idealised mathematical model of a multi-bladed rotor system were formulated. Generalised aerodynamic forces were obtained from quasi-steady blade element theory. These 13; equations were linearised and solved for a symmetric case of the system. The stability boundaries for different <b>hinge</b> <b>offsets</b> of the blades are presented as nacelle frequency parameter for neutral instability against blade flapping frequency parameter. It was found that for a particular value of the flapping frequency parameter, which {{is a function of}} blade <b>hinge</b> <b>offset</b> and restraint spring constant at the flapping hinge, the nacelle frequency parameter required for neutral instability is minimum. From these results it can be shown that an optimum flapping hinge position from the whirl flutter point of view can be determined. Low speed wind tunnel experiments were performed on a simplified model with different <b>hinge</b> <b>offset</b> conditions. Both 10 per cent and 13. 6 per cent <b>hinge</b> <b>offsets</b> resulted in backward whirl flutter as predicted by theory...|$|R

40|$|Biodiversity offset {{areas may}} {{compensate}} for ecological {{damage caused by}} human activity elsewhere. One way of determining the <b>offset</b> <b>ratio,</b> or the compensation area needed, is to divide the present conservation value of the development site by the predicted future conservation value of a compensation area of the same size. Matching mean expected utility {{in this way is}} deficient because it ignores uncertainty and time lags in the growth of conservation value in compensation areas. Instead, we propose an uncertainty analytic framework for calculating what we call robustly fair <b>offset</b> <b>ratios,</b> which guarantee a high enough probability of the exchange producing at least as much conservation value in the offset areas than is lost from the development site. In particular, we analyze how the fair <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> is influenced by uncertainty in the effectiveness of restoration action, correlation between success of different compensation areas, and time discounting. We find that very high <b>offset</b> <b>ratios</b> may be needed to guarantee a robustly fair exchange, compared to simply matching mean expected utilities. These results demonstrate that considerations of uncertainty, correlated success/failure, and time discounting {{should be included in the}} determination of the <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> to avoid a significant risk that the exchange is unfavorable for conservation in the long run. This is essential because the immediate loss is certain, whereas future gain is uncertain. The proposed framework is also applicable to the case when offset areas already hold conservation value and do not require restoration action, in which case uncertainty about the conservation outcome will be lower...|$|R

40|$|Helicopters {{like the}} EC 135 with its bearingless main rotor design feature large {{equivalent}} <b>hinge</b> <b>offsets</b> of about 10 %, {{significantly higher than}} conventional rotor designs and leading to improved maneuverability and agility. For such a helicopter, the fuselage and rotor responses become fully coupled and the quasi-steady assumption using a 6 -DoF rigid-body model state space description and approximating the neglected rotor degrees of freedom by equivalent time delays is not suitable. Depending on the intended use of the model, the accurate mathematical description of the vertical motion for these configurations requires an extended model structure that includes inflow and coning dynamics.

Next, identification results for the DLR EC 135 are presented for a model that only describes the vertical motion excluding coupling to the other axes.

Hence, the prevalence of cam and pincer deformities in the overall population may be underestimated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to screen an unselected cohort of people without hip symptoms for native radiological signs of cam and pincer deformities to determine their actual prevalence. Materials and Methods. 110 asymptomatic patients had AP pelvis X-rays and cross-table hip X-rays performed. We evaluated the images for the {{presence of}} cross-over signs and measured lateral center edge (LCE) angles, alpha angles (α-angles), and femoral <b>offset</b> <b>ratios.</b> Results.

40|$|Offsetting is {{a policy}} {{instrument}} intended to provide flexibility for development. We developed a simple calculator to predict when no net loss is feasible using biodiversity <b>offsetting.</b> Assuming <b>offset</b> <b>ratios</b> ≤ 10 : 1 are indicative of operational feasibility and employing a discount rate of 3 %, we predicted that no net loss is feasible where biodiversity can be restored within 55 years, which restricts the impacts on biodiversity that can be offset using restoration. Alternatively, no net loss is feasible by avoiding loss to biodiversity that is declining under the counterfactual {{at an annual rate}} ≥ 6 %. However, this is considerably higher than typical background rates of biodiversity loss so restricts where avoided-loss offsets are feasible. No net loss is theoretically feasible in the broadest range of circumstances if biodiversity gains are provided in advance of development.

The steady state flapping response is examined with respect to control input and aircraft angular rate which leads to a feedforward control law for control decoupling through cross feed, and a feedback control law to decouple the steady state flapping response. The condition for achieving perfect decoupling of the flapping response due to aircraft pitch and roll rates without using feedback control is also found for the hover case.

50|$|In contrast, low-g {{conditions}} can be disastrous for helicopters. In {{such a situation}} their rotors may flap beyond normal limits. The excessive flapping can cause {{the root of the}} blades to exceed the limit of their hinges and this condition, known as mast bumping, can cause the separation of the blades from the hub or for the mast to shear, and hence detach the whole system from the aircraft, falling from the sky. This is especially true for helicopters with teetering rotors, such as the two-bladed design seen on Robinson helicopters.This effect was first discovered when many accidents with Bell UH-1 and AH-1 helicopters occurred. These particular helicopters simply crashed without any obvious cause. Later, it was found that these accidents usually happened during low terrain flight after passing a ridge and initiating a dive from the previous climb.Articulated and rigid rotor systems do not lose controlling forces up to 0g, but may encounter this depending on their flapping <b>hinge</b> <b>offset</b> from the mast.

The measured large Zeeman splittings {{of the principal}} excitonic transitions provide input to a theory which addresses the role of excitons {{in the case of}} a small bandoffset. Proper inclusion of the exciton contribution is crucial to the accurate determination of the offset parameters. For the prototype sample of 50 A CdTe well widths and Mn-ion concentration x= 0. 24 in the barrier layers, the conduction-to-valence band <b>offset</b> <b>ratio</b> is found to be about 14 : 1...|$|R
