500|$|Her eyes gaze {{downward}} in humility, {{in contrast}} to her relatively extravagant clothes. The piety of her expression is achieved through motifs common to van der Weyden's work. Her eyes and nose are elongated and <b>her</b> <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> made fuller {{by the use of}} tone and pronounced finish. Some vertical lines around these features are emphasised, while her pupils are enlarged and her eyebrows slightly raised. In addition the contours of her face are highlighted {{in a manner that is}} slightly unnatural and abstract, and outside the usual spatial constraints of 15th-century human representation. This methodology was described by art historian Erwin Panofsky: [...] "Rogier concentrated on certain salient features—salient both from a physiognomical and psychological point of view—which he expressed primarily by lines." [...] Her high forehead and full mouth have been seen as suggestive of a nature at once intellectual, ascetic, and passionate, symbolic of [...] "an unresolved conflict in her personality". Panofsky refers to a [...] "smouldering excitability".|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlveolar soft-part sarcomas are {{clinically}} and morphologically distinct soft-tissue sarcomas, with {{an unknown}} histogenesis. When the tumors affect {{the region of}} the head and neck, they are often located in the orbit and tongue. We report a case of an alveolar soft-part sarcoma in the left masseter of a 28 -year-old female. The patient had chronic pain and paresthesia of <b>her</b> left <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> Panoramic radiography and computed tomography showed a well-delimited radiolucent mass in the left ramus. An incisional biopsy was performed, and the sample submitted for histopathological study. The tumor showed positive periodic acid-Schiff diastase-resistant granules.

5000|$|The {{painting}} is composed through {{a mix of}} horizontal and vertical lines. The verticals of her head-dress blend into the lines of her shoulders and chest, while the horizontal folds of the veil are set against the line formed by <b>her</b> upper and <b>lower</b> <b>lips.</b> Given the individuality of her features, Rogier was obviously working from a life study of an actual person. Yet there are elements of abstraction in the image. The model is likely {{a member of the}} middle class, given her relatively plain dress, matronly features and accentuated breasts. [...] It is widely believed that she was modeled on the artist's wife, Elisabeth Goffaert, though this has not been proven. The portrait is similar to other female portraits by Rogier and Robert Campin. In fact, the similarity between Rogier's and Campin's female portraits is so strong that they were sometimes mis-attributed.|$|R

30|$|At the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> area, the {{regression}} analysis showed that sex, the initial dento-skeletal, and soft tissue morphology were correlated with the horizontal change of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> evaluated at the Li and Ils points. The patients with less ANB angle had less <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion after treatment, which {{was consistent with the}} study of Zierhut et al [23]. Additionally, the patients with less lower incisor proclination before treatment seemed to have more <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion after treatment. Moreover, patients with less nasolabial and labiomental angles had more <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion after treatment. The thickness of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> also {{played an important role in}} <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion, which corresponded with the study of Oliver [8] who found a strong correlation between osseous and soft tissue changes in patients with thin lips. Moreover, the boys had more <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> protrusion than that of the girls.|$|R

40|$|The {{patient is}} a 61 year {{old man with}} a shave biopsy proven {{squamous}} cell carcinoma (SCC) of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> Seven years ago, the patient underwent Moh’s surgery for the same diagnosis on the <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> Patient reports that over the past 6 years the lesion has increased in size, has bled at intervals, and was not healing. QUESTIONS 1. What are the main causes of defects of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip?</b> 2. What are risk factors for SCC of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip?</b> 3.

Other causes include trauma, burns, infectious diseases, hemangiomas, and congenital clefts. 1 Defects of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip</b> are more frequently encountered because of the high incidence of SCC of the <b>lower</b> <b>lip.</b> Squamous cell carcinoma accounts for 95 % of lip malignancies with 90 % o...|$|R
