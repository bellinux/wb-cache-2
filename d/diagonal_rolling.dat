40|$|ABSTRACT. Cover crops {{have been}} {{recognized}} as a vital component of conservation agriculture. However, cover crops must produce substantial biomass to be effective. Because of {{the large amount of}} residue produced by many cover crops, they must be managed appropriately to avoid planting problems. Roller‐crimpers have been used to manage cover crops by flattening them and creating a thick mat over the soil surface. A study was conducted to determine the effect of different rolling directions (parallel, diagonal, and perpendicular to cotton planting direction) using a roller/crimper, three different commercial row cleaners (Dawn, Dawn without coulter, and Yetter), and no row cleaner on cotton (Gossypium hirsutum L.) stand, emergence rate, yield, and net returns. The study was conducted at two Alabama locations with a replicated strip plot design. Presented results illustrate two growing and harvest seasons (2004 and 2005). Rye (Secale cereale L.) was chosen as the cover crop due to its potential to produce large amounts of biomass and its popularity with Alabama producers. Rye was rolled at the soft dough growth stage and terminated using Roundup (glyphosate). Data showed that parallel rolling with respect to the planting direction for cotton produced the highest cotton stand and yield in both years. In 2004, the Yetter row cleaner resulted in higher cotton stand and yield for both locations when compared with the Dawn row cleaner. However, in 2005, the Dawn row cleaner resulted in a greater cotton yield than the Yetter. Based on the emergence rate index (ERI), the most rapid emergence was observed with parallel rolling and both row cleaners. The slowest emergence rate was observed with perpendicular and <b>diagonal</b> <b>rolling</b> and no row cleaners. Parallel rolling minimized accumulated rye residue on the row cleaners and minimize...|$|E
40|$|This project {{consisted}} of designing {{and developing a}} split Hopkinson pressure bar (SHPB) apparatus to perform tensile tests on metallic sheet materials at strain rates from 500 s- 1 to 2000 s- 1. The mechanical components that were designed and built are: a gas gun, incident/transmission bars and a momentum trap. A data acquisition system with two data acquisition cards with a maximum sampling rate of up to 60 MS/s was used. This apparatus was successfully assembled, calibrated and tested. A software code was developed to post-process the experimental strain data and determine the corresponding flow curves. The accuracy of this tensile SHPB apparatus was demonstrated by testing DP 600 sheet steel specimens in the <b>rolling,</b> <b>diagonal</b> and transverse directions. When compared to published data for the same sheet material tested in a different laboratory, the overall errors {{were found to be}} 3. 20 %, 4. 05 %, and 3. 87 % for the <b>rolling,</b> <b>diagonal</b> and transverse directions, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Advanced {{high-strength}} steels (AHSSs) exhibit large, {{and sometimes}} anisotropic, springback recovery after forming. Accurate {{description of the}} anisotropic elasto-plastic behaviour of sheet metals is critical for predicting their anisotropic springback behaviour. For some materials, the initial anisotropy is maintained while hardening progresses. However, for other materials, anisotropy changes with hardening. In this work, {{to account for the}} evolution of anisotropy of a dual-phase steel, an elastoplastic material constitutive model is developed. In particular, the combined isotropic–kinematic hardening model was modified. Tensile loading–unloading, uniaxial and biaxial tension, and tension–compression tests were conducted along the <b>rolling,</b> <b>diagonal,</b> and transverse directions to measure the anisotropic properties, and the parameters of the proposed constitutive model were determined. For validation, the proposed model was applied to a U-bending process, and the measured springback angles were compared to the predicted ones...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA phenomenological {{material}} model describing anisotropic plastic {{behavior of}} 21 -Cr {{ferritic stainless steel}} sheet was investigated using a non-quadratic anisotropic yield function. Uniaxial tension tests in <b>rolling,</b> <b>diagonal</b> and transverse directions, equi-biaxial bulge test and disk compression test were conducted for determining parameters of the yield criterion. Especially, Rb(ɛTD /ɛRD) values obtained from disk compression test and equi-biaxial bulge test were compared. For modeling of yield anisotropy of a metal sheet, the yield function, Yld 2000 - 2 d has been widely used by assuming that the shape of its initial yield locus does not change during deformation. In this study, in order to consider variation of stress ratios, coefficients (α 1 ∼α 8) of Yld 2000 - 2 d model were assumed to be functions of the equivalent plastic strain and the corresponding yield function was implemented into the user material subroutine in the FE software ABAQUS. Effects of variation of stress ratios during deformation were studied using single element FE simulations. Results showed that Yld 2000 - 2 d model with varying coefficients could describe the stress-strain curves under both uniaxial tension and equi-biaxial bulge better than that with constant coefficients...|$|R
40|$|International audienceExperimental and {{numerical}} cup {{drawing process}} has been investigated on 0. 65 mm zinc sheets. The cup exhibits anisotropic earrings due to the material microstructure. The material formability is studied through elliptical bulge tests in the <b>rolling,</b> <b>diagonal</b> and transverse direction. High anisotropy of the formability is observed. The numerical simulation of cup drawing is then made and demonstrates the correct fitting with experimental results. A stress formability criterion developed by Jansen et al. [14] is then implemented into a finite element method software and applied to predict the material rupture observed for some process conditions. The risk zone of the cup is subjected to some strain path changes according to the simulation whereas the strain value does not explain the rupture according to the experimental formability measured by the bulge tests. It {{has been shown that}} the rupture is due to some critical stresses, which are reached in the risk zone of the cup. The use of the stress criterion and its non-dependence on the strain path change allows the fracture prediction. Finally, the numerical fracture propagation by the “kill element method”, as briefly discussed by Bouchard et al. [4], is used and shows a good similarity with the experience...|$|R
