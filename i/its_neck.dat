5|$|Dinocephalosaurus {{may also}} have used <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> to capture its prey via suction feeding. After flexing <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> to the side (which would have been {{facilitated}} by the slenderness of the cervical ribs), the act of straightening the neck would have caused the cervical ribs to splay outwards due to {{the action of the}} neck muscles attached to the ribs. As the head lunged forward, the volume of the esophagus would have increased, creating suction. Once the prey was caught, the fang-like teeth would have secured the prey in the mouth. Like other aquatic amniotes, Dinocephalosaurus would have swallowed and digested its prey head-first, as evinced by the preservation of a perleidid fish in the abdominal region of LPV 30280 from Luoping.|$|E
5|$|Other {{studies by}} Taylor find that all {{tetrapods}} appear {{to hold their}} necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture; they argue the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from that of other animals. Apatosaurus, like Diplodocus, would have held <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> angled upwards with the head pointing downwards in a resting posture. Kent Stevens and Michael Parrish (1999 and 2005) state Apatosaurus had a great feeding range; <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> could bend into a U-shape laterally. The neck's range of movement would have also allowed the head to feed {{at the level of}} the feet.|$|E

5|$|A {{waterfall}} bong (or {{reverse bucket}} bong) is another method of smoking. It is assembled using a large plastic bottle (preferably about 2 liter), a bung or rubber stopper, a brass cut nozzle {{to act as}} a bowl and keep the marijuana (or other herbs) from entering the bottle, and an aerator screen. Once the bottle is filled to <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> in water the lid is screwed on, removing the rubber stopper and igniting the contents of the bowl leads to draining water to cause smoke to be drawn into the bottle. The cap is removed after the water has completely drained out, allowing the user to inhale the smoke.|$|E
5|$|Brolgas {{are well}} known for their ritualised, {{intricate}} mating dances. The performance begins with a bird picking up some grass and tossing it into the air before catching it in its bill. The bird then jumps a metre (yard) into the air with outstretched wings and continues by stretching <b>its</b> <b>neck,</b> bowing, strutting around, calling and bobbing its head up and down. Sometimes just one brolga dances for its mate; often they dance in pairs; and sometimes {{a whole group of}} about a dozen dance together, lining up roughly opposite each other before they start.|$|E
5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> erect. It closes its beak to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E

5|$|The false potto {{generally}} {{resembles a}} small potto, {{but according to}} Schwartz it differs in having a longer tail, shorter spines on <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> and chest vertebrae, a smaller, less complex spine on the second neck vertebra, an entepicondylar foramen (an opening in the humerus, or upper arm bone), a lacrimal fossa (a depression in the skull) that is located inside the eye socket, a smaller upper third premolar and molar, and higher-crowned cheekteeth, among other traits. However, many of these traits are variable among pottos; for example, one researcher found entepicondylar foramina in {{almost half of the}} specimens in his sample of pottos.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a large}} duck, and the male's long central tail {{feathers}} {{give rise}} to the species' English and scientific names. Both sexes have blue-grey bills and grey legs and feet. The drake is more striking, having a thin white stripe running {{from the back of}} its chocolate-coloured head down <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> to its mostly white undercarriage. The drake also has attractive grey, brown, and black patterning on its back and sides. The hen's plumage is more subtle and subdued, with drab brown feathers similar to those of other female dabbling ducks. Hens make a coarse quack and the drakes a flute-like whistle.|$|E
5|$|Female {{macaroni}} penguins {{can begin}} breeding at around {{five years of}} age, while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old. Females breed {{at a younger age}} because the male population is larger. The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed. Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony, sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory, and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts. In the 'ecstatic display', a penguin bows forward, making loud throbbing sounds, and then extends its head and neck up until <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> and beak are vertical. The bird then waves its head from side to side, braying loudly. Birds also engage in mutual bowing, trumpeting, and preening. Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three-quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year.|$|E

25|$|Like most plesiosaurs, and {{in stark}} {{contrast}} to many common media depictions, Elasmosaurus was incapable of raising anything more than its head above the water. The weight of <b>its</b> long <b>neck</b> placed the center of gravity behind the front flippers. Thus Elasmosaurus could only have raised <b>its</b> head and <b>neck</b> above the water if in shallow water, where it could rest its body on the bottom. The weight of the neck, the limited musculature, and the limited movement between the vertebrae would have prevented Elasmosaurus from raising <b>its</b> head and <b>neck</b> very high as well. The head and shoulders of the Elasmosaurus most likely acted as a rudder. If the animal moved the anterior part of the body in a certain direction, it would cause {{the rest of the body}} to move in that direction. Thus, Elasmosaurus could not have swum in one direction while moving <b>its</b> head and <b>neck</b> either horizontally or vertically in a different direction.|$|R

5|$|In the {{original}} description of Dinocephalosaurus, Li recognized the postorbital {{region and the}} elongated cervical centra as being indicative of {{a close relationship with}} Tanystropheus, which led him to assign it to the Tanystropheidae. However, Rieppel and colleagues subsequently noted characteristics that distinguished Dinocephalosaurus from derived protorosaurs such as Tanystropheus, Macrocnemus, Langobardisaurus, and Tanytrachelos; these include the lack of tapering at {{the front end of the}} nasal and an unreduced contribution of the ilium to the acetabulum. This led Rieppel and colleagues to consider Dinocephalosaurus as an indeterminate protorosaur, with <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> elongation been convergent upon that of Tanystropheus. Their phylogenetic tree, based on a dataset derived from the separate analyses of Jalil (1997), David Dilkes (1998), and Michael Benton & Jackie Allen (1997), is reproduced below, at left.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held {{high up in}} the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models in this study was Diplodocus, which they found would have held <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
5|$|The Rodrigues {{solitaire}} shared traits {{with the}} dodo, its closest relative, such as size and {{features in the}} skull, pelvis and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof and larger orbits. <b>Its</b> <b>neck</b> and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.|$|E

50|$|The Kilaaks then unleash {{the space}} dragon King Ghidorah {{to kill the}} Earth monsters. Gorosaurus plays {{a pivotal role in}} the battle, as it twice brings down Ghidorah (the only monster who is able to), the first by pulling on <b>its</b> <b>necks</b> until it falls, heralding the turn of the tide of battle to the Earth monsters' side, and second when it used its {{kangaroo}} kick to knock him over again, as Godzilla and Anguirus attack two of the heads, leaving Ghidorah vulnerable. After killing Ghidorah, Gorosaurus and the other Earth monsters return to Monsterland to live in peace.|$|R
5|$|The {{breeding}} male {{is bright}} russet or cinnamon red on its upperparts from its crown to its rump, {{with a black}} streaking on its mantle. It has a small black bib and black around its eye, separated from the russet of its crown by a very thin white supercilium, a stripe running from the bill {{to the rear of}} the head. The side of <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> and cheek are off-white, and its underparts are pale grey or washed with yellow, varying geographically. Shoulders and greater coverts are chestnut, and its median coverts are black at the base with white at the tips. The rest of the wing is light brown with black tinges. Its tail is blackish brown, edged with ashy brown. The non-breeding male differs little from the breeding male, being paler with more orange upperparts. The only species with which the male is easily confused is the Eurasian tree sparrow, which differs in its black cheek spot and brown back.|$|E
5|$|The {{embryonic}} individual of Dinocephalosaurus preserved inside LPV 30280 from Luoping can {{be identified}} as such for several reasons. First, it is enclosed entirely within the body cavity of the adult. Its cervical ribs - which are long, {{like that of the}} adult - face the same direction as the dorsal vertebrae of the adult, which is in contradiction to the typical head-first method of swallowing prey among amniotes. It is also preserved with <b>its</b> <b>neck</b> curling towards its forelimbs, a posture which is seen among vertebrate embryos but not adult Dinocephalosaurus specimens, which generally have the neck bent upwards. The absence of hands associated with the forelimbs in the embryo may be an artifact of preservation, but it may also be due to the sequence in which the limb bones of tetrapods ossify.|$|E
5|$|The skull {{is unknown}} except for {{possibly}} {{a portion of}} lower jaw found at the same site {{as the rest of}} the known Coelurus material. Although it has the same preservation and coloring as the fossils known to belong to the Coelurus skeleton, it is very slender, which may mean it does not belong to the skeleton; this bone is 7.9centimeters long (3.1in) but only 1.1centimeters tall (0.43in). In general, its vertebrae were long and low, with low neural spines and thin walls to the bodies of the vertebrae. <b>Its</b> <b>neck</b> vertebrae were very pneumatic, with numerous hollow spaces on their surfaces (pleurocoels); these hollows were not evenly distributed among the vertebrae and varied in size. The neck vertebrae were very elongate, with bodies four times longer than wide, and they articulated with concave faces on both ends (amphicoely). The back vertebrae were not as elongate, lacked surface hollows, and had less developed concave faces and bodies that were hourglass-shaped. The tail vertebrae also lacked surface hollows.|$|E
