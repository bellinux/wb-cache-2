5|$|The game {{begins in}} the Arizona Territory in 1876 with Jericho {{attempting}} to rob a Darkwatch train that is transporting the captured Lazarus Malkoth to the Darkwatch Citadel, a frequently mentioned and often visited location in the game. His actions inadvertently release Lazarus into the West. In a seeming bit of mercy, Lazarus bites Jericho and gives him {{the curse of the}} vampire, causing him to slowly turn into one. The game continues with the introduction of Darkwatch agent Cassidy Sharp as well as the appearance of Shadow, Jericho's undead horse whom he fed on and turned <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> after being bitten by Lazarus.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the castle}} of the Grail, Amfortas is {{brought before the}} Grail shrine and Titurel's coffin. He cries out, asking his dead father to grant him rest from his sufferings and expresses the desire {{to join him in}} death (""). The Knights of the Grail passionately urge Amfortas to uncover the Grail again but Amfortas, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy,</b> says he will never again show the Grail. He {{commands}} the Knights, instead, to kill him and end his suffering and the shame he has brought on the Knighthood. At this moment, Parsifal steps forth and says that only one weapon can heal the wound (""). He touches Amfortas' side with the Spear and both heals and absolves him. Parsifal commands the unveiling of the Grail. As all present kneel, Kundry, released from her curse, sinks lifeless to the ground as a white dove descends and hovers above Parsifal.|$|E

25|$|In 1831, Nat Turner, a literate slave {{who claimed}} to have spiritual visions, {{organized}} a slave rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia; it was sometimes called the Southampton Insurrection. Turner and his followers killed nearly 60 white inhabitants, mostly women and children. Many {{of the men in the}} area were attending a religious event in North Carolina. Eventually Turner was captured with 17 other rebels, who were subdued by the militia. Turner and his followers were hanged, and Turner's body was flayed. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of fear and retaliation, the militia killed more than 100 slaves who had not been involved in the rebellion. Planters whipped hundreds of innocent slaves to ensure resistance was quelled.|$|E
25|$|King Marke leads {{a hunting}} party {{out into the}} night, leaving Isolde and Brangäne alone in the castle, who both stand beside a burning brazier. Isolde, {{listening}} to the hunting horns, believes several times that the hunting party is far enough away to warrant the extinguishing of the brazier – the prearranged signal for Tristan to join her ("Nicht Hörnerschall tönt so hold"). Brangäne warns Isolde that Melot, one of King Marke's knights, has seen the amorous looks exchanged between Tristan and Isolde and suspects their passion ("Ein Einz'ger war's, ich achtet' es wohl"). Isolde, however, believes Melot to be Tristan's most loyal friend, and, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of desire, extinguishes the flames. Brangäne retires to the ramparts to keep watch as Tristan arrives.|$|E
25|$|The Glasgow and Edinburgh lines {{combined}} at Carstairs in Clydesdale, and {{the route}} then crossed over Beattock summit {{and continued on}} through Annandale. The promoters had engaged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of provisional acquisitions of other lines being put forward or already being constructed, as they considered it was vital to secure territory to their own control and to exclude competing concerns as far as possible. However, if they hoped to operate the only Anglo-Scottish route, they were disappointed. The North British Railway opened between Edinburgh and Berwick-upon-Tweed on 22 June 1846, forming part of what has become the East Coast Main Line. The Glasgow, Paisley, Kilmarnock and Ayr Railway had opened in 1841 with the declared intention of reaching Carlisle by way of Dumfries; it did so in 1850, changing its name then to the Glasgow and South Western Railway.|$|E

25|$|Soon after Peete {{began working}} for the Logans, she began telling neighbors that Arthur Logan had fits of rage and {{physically}} attacked her and Margaret on several occasions. On June 1, 1944, Margaret Logan disappeared. Three days later, Arthur Logan was committed to Patton State Hospital by Peete {{who claimed to be}} his foster sister. When neighbors began asking about Margaret Logan's whereabouts, Peete claimed that Arthur Logan had attacked his wife <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> and bitten her nose so severely that she was left disfigured. When Peete's husband began asking about Margaret Logan's whereabouts, Peete reiterated that Arthur Logan had attacked his wife and added that Margaret had gone into seclusion to undergo plastic surgery. For the next six months, Peete and her husband continued to live in the Logans' home. As she had with Jacob Denton, Peete began spending the Logans' money and forging their names on checks. On December 6, 1944, Arthur Logan died while still committed to Patton State Hospital. Peete donated his body to science.|$|E
25|$|The Boer {{government}} handed their raid prisoners {{over to the}} British for trial. Dr. Jameson {{was tried}} in England for leading the raid. However, the British press and London society inflamed by anti-Boer and anti-German feeling and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of jingoism, lionised Dr. Jameson and treated him as a hero. Although sentenced to 15 months imprisonment (which he served in Holloway), Jameson was later rewarded by being named Prime Minister of the Cape Colony (1904–08) and ultimately anointed {{as one of the}} founders of the Union of South Africa. For conspiring with Jameson, the uitlander members of the Reform Committee (Transvaal) were tried in the Transvaal courts and found guilty of high treason. The four leaders were sentenced to death by hanging, but this sentence was next day commuted to 15 years' imprisonment; and in June 1896, the other members of the Committee were released on payment of £2,000 each in fines, all of which were paid by Cecil Rhodes. One Reform Committee member, Frederick Gray, had committed suicide while in Pretoria gaol, on 16 May, and his death was a factor in softening the Transvaal government's attitude to the remaining prisoners.|$|E
25|$|Maerth {{asserted}} that the eating of brain produces an aphrodisiac effect (presumably due to the vast amount of hormones in it), and that this initially caused apes to become addicted to them, organizing brain hunts wherein the males of another tribe were eaten and the females raped <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of brain-induced sex and violence. However, this diet also inadvertently increased brain size and intelligence while triggering the loss both of body hair and of our innate psychic abilities. Thus man gradually came into being, remaining cannibalistic until 50,000 years ago. Modern humans, alienated from their surroundings now that they've no telepathic contact with nature and each other as animals do, suffering from a distorted sexuality resulting from hormonal imbalances, and driven insane from the constant pressure of their unnaturally large brains pressing {{on the inside of}} their skulls, are inevitably destroying themselves with pollution, overpopulation, racial integration and ultimately, nuclear war. He foresees a return to cannibalism in the near future, and suggests that the reader should drop out of society, embrace a vegetarian diet, steep himself in the wisdom of the East and perhaps employ various wooden frames and wire devices to alter the shape of his skull as some ancient cultures did, thus relieving the pressure on the brain and partially restoring psychic powers.|$|E

500|$|Skyscrapers {{were also}} built in other {{developed}} countries, although reaching {{nowhere near the}} level of construction seen in the U.S. This was partially {{the result of a}} lack of funding but also because of local architectural preferences. European cities including London and Paris had laws to ban tall buildings, but elsewhere skyscrapers began to appear, including Toronto's Imperial Bank of Commerce Building, Antwerp's Boerentoren and Buenos Aires' Kavanagh Building. Many other European skyscrapers were proposed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> of excited planning, although few materialised. Soviet Russia began the construction of the [...] Palace of the Soviets in the late 1930s, in the Socialist Classicism style, which would have become the tallest building in the world, but war intervened and the skyscraper was never completed. In the post-war years, this style resulted in the monumental Seven Sisters of Moscow building.|$|E
500|$|Three plots then {{alternate}} {{through the}} play. In one, Caliban falls in with Stephano and Trinculo, two drunkards, believing Stephano to be a [...] "brave god" [...] who [...] "bears celestial liquor". They attempt {{to raise a}} coup against Prospero, which ultimately fails. In another, Prospero works to encourage a romantic relationship between Ferdinand and Miranda; the two fall immediately in love, but Prospero worries that [...] "too light winning [...] make the prize light", and compels Ferdinand to become his servant, pretending that he regards him as a spy. In the third subplot, Antonio and Sebastian conspire to kill Alonso and Gonzalo so that Sebastian can become King. Ariel thwarts them, at Prospero's command. Ariel appears to the [...] "three men of sin" [...] (Alonso, Antonio and Sebastian) as a harpy, reprimanding them for their betrayal of Prospero. Prospero, who has witnessed this, leaves to visit Ferdinand and Miranda. The three guilty nobles run off, distracted and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy,</b> and Gonzalo and the attendant lords chase after {{to prevent them from}} doing [...] "what this ecstasy may now provoke them to".|$|E

500|$|From the 1930s, Jinnah {{suffered}} from tuberculosis; only {{his sister and}} a few others close to him were aware of his condition. Jinnah believed public knowledge of his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that [...] "you must have read in the papers how during my tours... I suffered, which was not because there was anything wrong with me, but the irregularities [...] and over-strain told upon my health". Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition. [...] Fatima Jinnah later wrote, [...] "even in his hour of triumph, the Quaid-e-Azam was gravely ill... He worked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> to consolidate Pakistan. And, of course, he totally neglected his health..." [...] Jinnah worked with a tin of Craven [...] "A" [...] cigarettes at his desk, of which he had smoked 50 or more a day for the previous 30 years, as well as a box of Cuban cigars. [...] As his health got worse, he took longer and longer rest breaks in the private wing of Government House in Karachi, where only he, Fatima and the servants were allowed.|$|E
500|$|With 2:12 left, Chamberlain had 94 points, and {{he scored}} on a fadeaway for his 96th point. His next basket at 1:19 came off a lob pass from York Larese for a {{powerful}} dunk that was rare for Chamberlain. Gary M. Pomerantz in his book Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era wrote that Chamberlain's usual [...] "Dipper Dunk" [...] was [...] "a considerably less emphatic basket stuff, like a rock that barely ripples the pond." [...] With {{less than a minute}} left in the game, Chamberlain set up in the post. Ruklick passed to Rodgers, who passed to Chamberlain close to the basket, but he missed the shot. Ted Luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to Chamberlain, who missed again. Luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to Ruklick, who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a high pass to Chamberlain. With 46 seconds left, Chamberlain got free from the five Knicks, jumped high and put the ball into the basket to hit the century mark. [...] Eyewitness accounts of the historic basket differ as to whether Chamberlain merely laid the ball in or actually stuffed the ball through the hoop for an alley-oop slam dunk. In any event, the arena exploded <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> and over 200 spectators stormed the floor, wanting to touch the hero of the night. Ruklick immediately ran to the scorer's table to ensure that he was officially credited with the assist.|$|E
500|$|Greco-Roman mysteries were, in {{the words}} of the classicist Walter Burkert, [...] "initiation rituals of a voluntary, personal, and secret {{character}} that aimed at a change of mind through experience of the sacred." [...] These rituals were dedicated to a particular deity or group of deities, and they used a variety of intense experiences, such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise, that induced a state of disorientation and an intense religious experience. Some of them involved cryptic symbolism. Initiates were not supposed to discuss some of the details of what they experienced in the mysteries, and modern understanding of these rites is limited by this secrecy. The most prestigious mysteries in the Greek world were the Eleusinian mysteries dedicated to the goddess Demeter, which were performed at Eleusis, near Athens, from at least the sixth century BCE to the end of the fourth century CE. They centered on Demeter's search for her daughter Persephone in Greek mythology. Eleusinian initiates passed into a dark hall, the Telesterion, and were subjected to terrifying sights, followed by a fiery light and a shout from the hierophant who presided over the ceremony. By this light the initiates saw objects that represented Demeter's power over fertility, such as a sheaf of wheat, and perhaps other images that referred to the myth of Persephone. In the mysteries of the god Dionysus, which were performed in many places across the Greek world, participants celebrated <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>frenzy</b> at night, in the open air. Dionysian celebrations were connected in some way with Orphism, a group of mystical beliefs about the nature of the afterlife.|$|E
