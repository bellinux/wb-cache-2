40|$|Notions of immanence {{provide the}} {{implicit}} theoretical grammar for much work exploring the political terrain {{of an active}} transnational or radically cosmopolitan society in our day. In this paper I attempt to problematize such a gesture in the recent ‘turn to cosmopolis’, arguing that its conceptual frame fails to specify adequately the geohistorical preconditions for a politics capable of mediating between nationalizing and cosmopolitanizing tendencies at work in a globalizing world. For the case of Europe, I argue such a legacy may be more productively located in the ‘border work’ of mid- 20 th-century anti-imperialism and decolonization, whose struggles to redefine the postcolonial couplet of ‘nation’ and ‘state’ haunt current attempts by the European Union to craft a more inclusive and cosmopolitan transboundary future. I explore how such governmentalizing phantasms specifically inform attempts to create viable cross-border regions (<b>euregios)</b> within the EU, and continue to gnaw at attempts to negotiate boundary disputes at the outer limits of the continent. In conclusion, a cautious rite of exorcism is ventured by engaging with the elusive anti-imperial cosmopolitanism of Frantz Fanon. ...|$|R
40|$|In the European Union, {{multilingualism}} {{has become}} a political goal but also a political need. Today nearly 500 million people with different historical, social and cultural backgrounds {{live and work in}} the European Union. Out of many diverse nations, communities, cultures and language groups, a single European Union is built around the equal interchange of ideas and traditions. There is therefore a political need to increase multilingualism in the European Union. The goals of forging cohesion between Member States, and enhancing the feeling of being European citizens in the citizens of those States, can be reached through intercultural understanding and enhanced communication skills (Commission of the European Communities 2003). Yet there is also an economic need to increase multilingualism in Europe. Trade between the Member States of the European Union is growing every year (Biancone 2006). So-called <b>Euregios</b> are being developed across the borders of the Member States (Perkmann 2002). Exchanges between the inhabitants of the European Union {{are becoming more and more}} frequent. Moreover, even though many Member States of the European Union are officially monolingual countries, the linguistic situation is more complex. In each State, there is an official language, one or more minority languages, and other languages spoken by large groups of immigrants (Nelde...|$|R
40|$|Acknowledging the {{slippery}} {{nature of the}} term “governance”, the paper begins by canvassing a “first-wave” of academic reflection on the governance of European cross-border regions, emergent {{in the early to}} mid- 1990 s amid a EU-phoric plethora of institutional innovations designed to create “laboratories of European integration ” within and across the internal borders formerly dividing European member states. The paper then excavates the limitations of this theoretical sediment, arguing that by drawing on literatures rooted in public administration and political science, the properly spatial dimension of cross-border governance has been muted, if not rendered invisible. The paper seeks to address this shortcoming by focusing on insights offered up by the “spatial turn ” in geography and the wider social sciences as they relate to the increasingly visible problematic of transboundary governance evident at this time. Through this conceptual frame the author argues for a normative as well as theoretical specificity to cross-border regional spatiality, one which foregrounds the fact that, rather than merely epiphenomenal or derivative to state space, European cross-border regions (or, <b>euregios)</b> today are themselves important sites where the very meaning of “the political” is being negotiated, contested, resisted and transformed. The paper suggests that a way forward in the analysis of governance in Europe’s cross-border regions will demand breaking beyond several key assump...|$|R

40|$|Where is Limburg? The Paradoxes of a Strong Regional Identity Limburg is a {{good example}} of the {{tensions}} that exist in the Dutch provinces Limburg {{is a good}} example of the tension that exist in the Dutch provinces between administrative territoriality, regional identity and spatial functionality. Right up to the present day, strong regional sentiments have hampered territorial restructuring based on more rational or functional criteria. Limburg was formed in 1815, much later than the other Dutch provinces, from different territories on both sides of the river Meuse. After the Belgian Revolt (1830 - 1839) it was divided into a western (Belgian) part and an eastern (Dutch) part. This is how the Dutch part of Limburg acquired its odd elongated shape. In spite of its recent formation, the inhabitants of the Dutch part developed a strong provincial identity. The identification with the province of Limburg as a territorial unity can, however, not be based on any objective characteristics, but is in itself a result of its progressive integration into the Dutch state, which made the inhabitants aware of their divergent dialect, religion, culture, and, last but not least, interests. The paper argues that this provincial regionalism will become more and more obsolete as state borders gradually become ‘denationalised’ through the process of European integration. As Limburg participates in two <b>Euregios,</b> Meuse-Rhine in the south and Rhine-Meuse North in the north, a growing administrative division within the province into a northern and southern part seems inevitable. </p...|$|R

50|$|The <b>EUREGIO</b> {{was thus}} granted an {{important}} role in the administrative procedures for Interreg-supported projects. All project proposals are collected by the secretariat where a first preselection is made based on the basis of the EUREGIO’s own criteria, the general Interreg requirements and the prevailing legislation for the territories of the member authorities. The strict <b>EUREGIO</b> criteria require all projects to have a genuine cross-border character in substantial, organisational, personal and financial respects. As the relevant agreement states, projects must relate to a ‘Euregional interest’, linked to a structural and socio-economic significance for the region (<b>EUREGIO</b> and Rhein-Ems 1996: 29). The approved proposals are submitted to the Steering Committee which is the highest instance in Interreg decision-making. As with the other Euroregions on the Dutch-German border, for the <b>EUREGIO</b> a separate SC has been established. Apart from the <b>EUREGIO</b> representatives, the Committee is composed of senior civil servants representing the following authorities: the Dutch ministry for Economics, and the provinces Drenthe, Overijssel and Gelderland on the Dutch side, and the Ministries of Economics of the German Länder NRW and Lower Saxony as well as the Bezirksregierungen Münster and Weser-Ems on the German side.|$|E
