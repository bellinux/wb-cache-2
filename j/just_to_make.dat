5|$|The {{first stage}} of the Paralympic {{competition}} was the group stage, a round-robin tournament. The Gliders faced a formidable task <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the finals, as their pool included Brazil, Great Britain, Canada and the Netherlands. Canada had beaten the Gliders in 2010, and the Netherlands was rated {{as one of the}} competition's best teams. After a narrow victory over Brazil, and an easier one against Great Britain, the Gliders were again defeated by Canada, but won their final match against the Netherlands to finish {{at the top of their}} pool. The Gliders went on to win the quarterfinal against Mexico and the semifinal against the United States, but lost to Germany in the final, winning silver.|$|E
5|$|After {{watching}} a dinosaur show at an arena in Springfield, Lisa discovers {{one of her}} favorite authors, T. R. Francis, working there in a dinosaur costume. The woman reveals to a shocked Lisa that she is just an actress the book publishing company used for the jacket photos, and that T. R. Francis is a complete fabrication. She further reveals that all popular young-adult book series were never each written by a single author with any inspiration, they are conceived by book publishing executives through market research and the use of multiple ghostwriters, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> more money. When Homer finds out about this, he decides to get rich by group-writing a fantasy novel. He recruits a team consisting of Bart, Principal Skinner, Patty Bouvier, Moe Szyslak, and Professor Frink, all of whom have personal attributes or experiences that will help with writing the book: Skinner knows what teens like, Patty is a fantasy fiction fan, Moe has already published some children's books, and Frink has a computer. Lisa is shocked to find that they are group-writing a book, as she knows the only reason one would do that is to gain money. To show that what they are doing is wrong, she decides to write a novel on her own with a personal story that readers will connect with.|$|E

25|$|India {{needed to}} cross 400 {{runs in the}} second innings <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Australia bat again, which they had not scored even once in the entire series. But VVS Laxman seemed to have found the form that had eluded him the entire series. The {{complete}} range of cricket strokes was on display as Laxman flew to 167 in just 198 balls, being particularly savage on Brett Lee (taking 52 runs off 5 overs at one point) and Shane Warne. The rest of the Indian batting, however, could not {{stand up to the}} accuracy of Glen McGrath as he took five wickets to go with the fifer in the first innings. He was declared Man of the Match, as Australia won comprehensively by an innings and 141 runs.|$|E

Meanwhile, Jess, who had been stowing away on one of the SDS helicopter replicas that one of the Patbot 3000s used, manages to make his way to where Pat’s performance, and he helps Pat escape after he is almost locked away in a dressing room by a Patbot and Mr Carbunkle, who reveals that Pat's publicity was <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people like him, so Mr Carbunkle could replace him with Patbots. They are then pursued by the Patbots.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} they began their second innings, Australia were in a worse {{situation}} than at Adelaide, needing to make 415 runs <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> England bat again, a man down (Harris being unable to bat after his ankle injury), and {{with more than half}} the match left to play. Australia got off to a quick start before Hughes was run out off Swann's bowling. Bresnan then took three wickets – Watson lbw, captain Ponting bowled and Hussey caught for a duck – to leave Australia 104/4. Australia finished day 3 on 169/6, 246 runs behind. An 86-run partnership on the fourth morning between Haddin and Siddle delayed the inevitable, but after Swann had Siddle caught by Pietersen at long-on, Bresnan dismissed Hilfenhaus for a pair to seal the match. Australia were bowled out for 258 and England retained the Ashes, winning by an innings and 157 runs to go up 2-1 in the series with one match left to play.|$|E
25|$|Season 5 follows two {{timeline}}s. The first timeline {{takes place}} on the island where the survivors who were left behind erratically jump forward and backward through time. In one of these time periods, John speaks with Richard Alpert, one of the Others, who says that to save the island, he must bring everyone back. John goes to the same underground station Ben went to. After moving the wheel himself, John is transported to the Sahara in 2007, as the time shifts on the island stop and the survivors are stranded with the Dharma Initiative in 1974. In 2007, John contacts the Oceanic Six, but {{no one wants to}} return. The last one of the Oceanic Six he finds is a depressed Jack. John tells Jack his father is alive on the island. This seriously affects Jack, and he begins taking flights, hoping to crash on the island again. Ben finds John and kills him. After John's death, the Oceanic Six are told to board the Ajira Airways Flight 316 to return to the island and in order to go back, they have to take John Locke's body in the plane. They take the flight, but some land in 1977, in which they meet with the other survivors who are now part of the Dharma Initiative, and others land in 2007. The survivors in 1977 are told by Daniel Faraday that if they detonate a nuclear bomb at the hatch's construction site, the electromagnetic energy below it will be negated, and, thus, the hatch would never be built and, thus, their future could be changed. In 2007, John Locke apparently comes back to life. He instructs Richard Alpert to speak with a time-traveling John and tell him that he must bring everyone back to the island. After this, he goes to speak with Jacob. The season finale reveals that John Locke is still dead and another entity has taken over his form <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Ben kill Jacob. In 1977, Juliet detonates the fission core taken from the hydrogen bomb.|$|E

After {{recording}} Taking Back Sunday's self-titled EP, Longo left the band and eventually played with Guilt Like Gravity and the Mirror. In December 2000, Lazzara switched from bass to lead vocals. He never thought he would become the group's singer: [...] "I remember getting into [...] Windstar with that [...] and just driving around singing those songs, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> myself actually do it." [...] O'Connell suggested that the group needed a bassist, and brought in Shaun Cooper of Breaking Pangaea. In February 2001, Taking Back Sunday released a five-track demo before touring for a year.|$|E

500|$|Titanic Ventures Inc., a Connecticut-based consortium, co-sponsored {{a survey}} and salvage {{operation}} in 1987 with the French oceanographic agency IFREMER. The expedition produced an outcry, {{not least because}} of the damage that it caused to the wreck. When the crow's nest bell was pulled from the mast, the crow's nest itself, where the lookouts first saw the iceberg, collapsed. A Titanic survivor, Eva Hart, was outspoken in her condemnation of what many saw as the looting of a mass grave: [...] "To bring up those things from a mass sea grave <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a few thousand pounds shows a dreadful insensitivity and greed.

500|$|Known gunmen/lawmen were {{generally}} effective, {{and in time}} the violence would subside, usually after the gunman/lawman {{had been involved in}} several shooting incidents, eventually leading to a substantial and well earned fear that kept everyone in line. At times they were hired by cattlemen or other prominent figures to serve as henchmen or enforcers during cattle wars. Although sanctioned by law enforcement officials, the gunmen were not always actually deputized. Sometimes, however, <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> things [...] "official", they would go through the formality of deputization. A case in point: the service of the Jesse Evans Gang, and outlaw Jesse Evans himself, as agents for the Murphy-Dolan faction during the Lincoln County War. While technically working as lawmen, they were little more than hired guns.|$|E
500|$|Sir Francis Dashwood adopted some of {{the ideas}} of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French, when he founded a group called the Monks of Medmenham (better known as the Hellfire Club).

[...] The group were known as the Franciscans, not after Saint Francis of Assisi, but after its founder, Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer. John Wilkes, George Dodington and other politicians were members. [...] There is little direct evidence of what Dashwood's Hellfire Club practiced or believed. The one direct testimonial comes from John Wilkes, a member who never got into the chapter-room of the inner circle.

[...] Viewers called ABC to complain and an online petition had gathered 30,000 signatures by October 3, 2007, {{three days after the}} episode's original broadcast. Several politicians and medical professionals of Filipino descent, including Health Secretary Francisco Duque III on Manila, condemned ABC for airing the line. On October 4, ABC announced that the episode had been removed from online platforms in order for the line to be removed; the line was also removed from future broadcasts and DVD productions of the episode.

500|$|Concerns {{over the}} animals' safety {{prompted}} an anonymous telephone {{call to the}} Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (RSPCA), which dispatched a representative. Initial tests with shocking had yielded disappointing results, necessitating an increase in voltage. According to Anderson, [...] "Meddings explained that his team were laying the crocodiles down and they weren't doing anything. They were just lying there. The RSPCA man said, well, they would, because of {{the warmth of the}} lamps. So Derek said, 'We've been giving them a touch with an electrode <b>just</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them move.'

ABC issued an apology on October 3, but the controversy grew to an international concern and Health Secretary Francisco Duque III of Manila publicly sought an apology from the series' producers. Protests against the network and series were staged, prompting ABC to remove the episode from digital and online platforms in order to apply edits. As a result, the line of controversy was removed from all future broadcasts of the episode, {{as well as from}} DVD productions. However, protests continued even after this action was taken.
