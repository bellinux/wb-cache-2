60|$|One great {{convenience}} {{of the new}} method of going on pilgrimage I must not forget to mention. Our enormous burdens, instead of being carried on our shoulders as had been the custom of old, were all snugly deposited in the baggage car, and, as I was assured, would be delivered to their respective owners at the journey's end. Another thing, likewise, the benevolent reader will be delighted to understand. It may be remembered {{that there was an}} ancient feud between Prince Beelzebub and the keeper of the wicket gate, and that the adherents of the former distinguished personage were accustomed to shoot deadly arrows at honest pilgrims while knocking at the door. This dispute, much to the credit as well of the illustrious potentate above mentioned as of the worthy and enlightened directors of the railroad, has been pacifically arranged on the principle of mutual compromise. The prince's subjects are now pretty numerously employed about the station-house, some in taking care of the baggage, others in collecting <b>fuel,</b> <b>feeding</b> the engines, and such congenial occupations; and I can conscientiously affirm that persons more attentive to their business, more willing to accommodate, or more generally agreeable to the passengers, are not to be found on any railroad. Every good heart must surely exult at so satisfactory an arrangement of an immemorial difficulty.|$|E

Having learned the secret to burning anthracite during the British blockades in 1814, White and Hazard joined a number of Philadelphia luminaries in subscribing to a joint stock venture to build the Schuylkill Canal, but quarreled with the others on the board of managers, who did not favor a rapid development. Investigating options, they learned the managers of the Lehigh Coal Mine Company were willing to option their rights, disgusted with their long term inability to make a profit bringing Anthracite nearly 110 miles from Pisgah Ridge. A group, the Lehigh Navigation Company was holding a charter to improve the navigability of the Lehigh River, but had little to show for repeated expenditures and their charter was due to expire in 1817. White and Hazard made their proposal, which specified improvements for only down river navigation, and in March 1818 received a charter effectively giving the company ownership of the Lehigh to do with as they would. It had one fall-back provision [...] - [...] at some time the legislature might require the improvements be made to enable two way navigation.|$|E

This invention relates to a combustion chamber in which mixed oxidizing and combustible gases or vapors may be continuously burned.

40|$|Fludized bed {{technology}} is very {{suitable for the}} combustion of biomass. Nevertheless substitution of coal with biomass affects boiler operation and especially dynamics and controllability. Non-homogeneity of biomass and <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> disturbances cause process unstability, such as variations in temperatures and pressures, which reduce lifetime of equipment and structures. Because of process unstability higher air coefficient must be used {{in order to avoid}} CO emissions, which is not economical. Combustion profiles for coal, wood and peat, measured at the VTT Processes Pilot circulating fluidized bed reactor, have been compared. Process stability and char inventories have been studied by the measurements and the model. Biofuels are usually very reactive and their combustion profiles are quite different compared to coals. Because of high reactivity and low char content combustion process with biofuels is very sensitive for <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding.</b> Also low char inventory effect on load changes combined with combustion profile that differs from coals.

Influence of oxygen concentration and temperature in the combustion chamber on carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxide concentrations was presented in diagrams.

Continuous fuel supply can even induce higher carbon monoxide concentrations when fuel mass stream is not chosen properly.

However, its early application relied on trial and error in selecting either the fuzzy membership functions or the fuzzy rules.

40|$|The {{combustion}} {{dynamics of}} coal, wood chips and their mixture is investigated. Load change capability {{and the effect}} of the individual control variables, for example the mixture ratio of different fuels, on pilot-scale CFB boiler dynamics were also studied. Disturbances in <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> cause fluctuations in the flue gas concentrations. Changes in the heating value are possible due to varying moisture content of the fuel. Both these disturbances affect the instantaneous firing rate in a boiler. Also the characteristics of the fuels have to be taken into consideration when designing boiler control systems. When co-firing two fuels with clearly distinct combustion characteristics, direct assumptions based on each fuel's characteristies cannot be made about combustion behaviour of their mixture. Combustion experiments with coal and wood chips and their co-firing were carried out in a pilot-scale CFB reactor (VTT) and a large-scale CFB boiler (Chalmers). A comparison of the combustion in the two different size reactors, provides information about scaling.

This paper investigates {{the application of a}} cascading hearth staged combustor to palm shells combustion in terms of <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> rate effect on temperature profiles. The application of a two-step hearth setup at primary stage combustion offers wider alternatives for solid phase combustion processes. Initial combustion studies of palm shells by controlled air combustion conditions using these set-ups show promising results for further development.

Varying the <b>fuel</b> <b>feed</b> at 0. 1, 0. 15 and 0. 2 kg/min with constant air supply of 227 liters/min (8 CFM) and good fuel distribution on the hearth leads to fuel core temperatures exceeding 1000 oC.

40|$|As more {{stringent}} emission limits and low consumption requirements also involve s. i. 2 -stroke engines, {{one of the}} most important design modifications that can cope with these constraints is to perform the scavenging process using pure air, which means not only fuel-free air but also oil-free air. A new single-cylinder prototype engine, equipped with a gasoline direct injection (GDI) apparatus has therefore been designed and built. In order to reduce manufacturing costs, this prototype was obtained by modifying a mass-produced 4 -stroke 4 -cylinder automotive engine. Apart from the replacement of the original indirect <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> system with GDI, two more remarkable features should be pointed out: the use of a force-fed lubrication system, like those used in current 4 -stroke engines and, as a consequence, the use of an external scavenging pump. Before using an electronically controlled direct injection system on the new prototype engine, the whole apparatus was tested on a mass-produced crankcase scavenged 2 -stroke engine (Husqvarna WR 250) in order to evaluate the magnitude of the improvements. A comparison of a carburettor <b>fuel</b> <b>feeding</b> system with a direct fuel injection system was carried out, under cubic power requirements, to check whether the GDI strategies were advantageous.
