The problem of the company is the imbalance of the production trajectory. The track balance in the final assembly will affect the amount of product that can be produced. The unbalanced track conditions resulted a bottleneck condition in the material flow from one work center to the other, resulting in delay time on the production floor.

40|$|An {{electron}} is {{a purely}} electromagnetic particle, a PEP. The biggest {{problem has been}} charge. Most simply put, charge is a source or sink of E fields. A way to assemble EM fields into a stable configuration that exhibits charge and other particle properties has been found, {{based in part on}} Weber's interpretation of the Faraday homopolar generator. A dipolar B field, spinning about its symmetry axis, creates a radial vxB electric field that falls off as 1 /r^ 2. This paper suggests that pair production involves the rearrangement of the EM fields of each half a photon. The EM fields then oscillate at the Compton frequency between a dipolar B field and a toroidal E field. Electric and magnetic flux are quantized. An electron has angular momentum, and so the EM <b>field</b> <b>assembly</b> is spinning. The 1 /r^ 2 E=vxB electric field, created by the spinning dipolar B field, is strongest at the waist and zero at the poles. Precession of the spin axis about a different axis and with the same rate as spin, produces charge. Otherwise, the sign of vxB oscillates, and = 0. Only the perpendicular component of the precessing and oscillating dipolar B field points in the same direction, relative to an observer. Precession at arccos 1 /sqrt 3 averages the anisotropic vxB field, so that becomes isotropic. The charge Q created by this model is found by Gauss' law. For an electron, Q=. 2503 e and for a proton, Q=. 6982 e. Dithering permits Q=e. This model also describes a magnetic monopole, upon interchanging the EM fields...|$|E

The objects you place in a design on paper are much easier to move around than the real-world building components, furniture, and equipment you deal with during construction. By scaling real-world objects up or down, you can work on them at a manageable size, manipulate them into the results you want, and easily share them with colleagues. In addition, by drawing real-world objects at different scales, you can show more or less detail without consuming entire forests of trees. For example, the layout of a factory floor might be scaled to 1 ⁄ 8 " = 1 ' 0 ", whereas the con-nection details between a steel column and a floor joist could be 1 ⁄ 2 " = 1 ' 0 ". For technical drawings such as architectural plans, accuracy is essential or the construction crews in the field will wield their hammers getting pieces to fit together — usually with results that don’t make the client or the architect happy.
