40|$|Compressed air {{energy storage}} {{is a way}} to store energy {{generated}} at one time for use at another time. At utility scale, energy generated during periods of low energy demand can be released to meet higher demand periods. Also compressed air is a commonly used utility across most manufacturing and processing industries as its production and handling are safe and easy. Compressed air systems are critical and play a pivotal role in the proper operation of many processing facilities since most of the instruments and controls depend on pressurized <b>instrumentation</b> <b>air</b> for operation. In this work, a simple predictive tool, which is easier than current available models involving a large number of parameters, requiring more complicated and longer computations, is presented here for the prediction of transport properties (namely thermal conductivity and viscosity) of compressed air at elevated pressures as a function of temperature and pressure using a simple Arrhenius-type function. The proposed correlation predicts the transport properties of air for temperature range between 260 and 1000 Â K, and pressures up to 1000 Â bar (100 Â MPa). Estimations are found to be in excellent agreement with the reliable data in the literature with average absolute deviation being around 1. 28 % and 0. 68 % for thermal conductivity and viscosity respectively.

This Case Study elaborates on the identification, analysis and restoration of performance. Compressor Rating: Casings: 2 with intercooler. Capacity: 19, 497 Inlet m 3 /hr [11, 476 ICFM]. Speed: 8400 rpm. Rated mass flow: 21, 585 Kg/hr [793 lb/min]. Power: 2. 3 MW. Discharge pressure: 10. 6 bara. [152. 3 Psia]. The subject air compressor forms part of the utility and <b>instrumentation</b> <b>air</b> supply system to an oil refinery. Constant pressure at header that supplies air to instrumentation system is very important. Any reduction in mass flow of dry air to the air supply system will result in reduction of the header pressure.

Performance testing at site indicated operating points almost on the design surge curve. The difference between the design polytrophic efficiency and the polytrophic efficiency calculated from data collected during operation at comparable operating points {{for the first and}} second casings were marginal, 0. 3 to 0. 7 percent. The calibration of the instrumentation used during testing was verified and the air inlet filter elements were replaced.

40|$|When {{centralised}} air-conditioning was extensively {{used in the}} Hong Kong {{office buildings}} back in the 1960 s', people had little concept about thermal comfort and indoor air quality. The demand for indoor climate {{was a sense of}} coolness. The energy crisis in 1970 s' triggered a compromised design by the building services engineers for energy conservation by the scarification of indoor comfort and health. It was in the beginning of 1990 s' that the people in Hong Kong realised the importance of indoor safety and health in terms of indoor environmental quality. In 1999, the Environmental Protection Department circulated an Indoor Air Quality Certification Scheme. Engineers have put much effort in improving the design. However, the provisions to facilitate a proper system operation and maintenance are still inadequate. In case of more concerns about indoor environmental health and comfort, engineers find themselves little clue on identifying problems because the provision of instrumentation in assessing performance of air-side systems of the air-conditioning systems is far less than sufficient. This paper describes the survey in 62 air-conditioned offices with an objective to investigate the provision of <b>instrumentation</b> in <b>air</b> side systems.

40|$|The {{response}} of radiosondes to an instantaneous change of environment was studied {{by taking the}} instruments from a warm building into the cold environment at South Pole Station. After being initialized inside, the radiosondes were carried outside and placed on the snow surface, where they were left until they reported stable values of temperature, pressure, and relative humidity. Three models of radiosondes were tested: Vaisala RS 80, Atmospheric <b>Instrumentation</b> Research (<b>AIR)</b> 4 A, and AIR 5 A. The reported temperature equilibrated to the outside conditions within 30 s. However, it frequently took 30 min before the relative humidity outside was accurately reported. Additionally, the reported pressure rose by several hectopascals over a 5 -min period when the sonde was taken outside. In the RS 80 s this bias was as large as 10 hPa, and disappeared in about 30 min. In the AIR sondes, the maximum pressure bias was never much over 2 hPa, but seemed not to diminish with time. The RS 80 s were also tested to see if, once equilibrated to the outside conditions, they could respond to smaller changes that would be encountered in flight. The results in this case indicate that, with some corrections for time lag, the RS 80 can provide accurate data at low temperatures if allowed to equilibrate initially. The results of these tests together indicate {{that the quality of}} upper-air data in cold regions could be improved if radiosondes are stored and prepared at ambient temperature or are given at least 30 min to equilibrate outside after being prepared inside. 1...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} {{to use an}} aircraft to measure wind profiles in the altitude range of 1, 500 to 18, 200 m was demonstrated at NASA Ames-Dryden. This demonstration was initiated to determine if an aircraft could measure wind profiles in support of space shuttle launches. The Jimsphere balloon is currently the device used to measure pre-launch wind profiles for the space shuttle. However, it takes approximately an hour for the Jimsphere to travel through the altitudes of interest. If these wind instruments could be taken with an aircraft closer to launch in a more timely manner and with the same accuracy as a Jimsphere balloon, some uncertainties in the measurements could be removed.

The HY- 100 steel vessel was designed to provide total containment for high explosives tests up to 22 lb (10 kg) of TNT equivalent. The vessel was fabricated from an 11. 5 -ft diameter cylindrical shell, 1. 5 in thick, and 2 : 1 elliptical ends, 2 in thick. Prior to delivery and acceptance, three types of tests were required for proof testing the vessel: a hydrostatic pressure test, air leak tests, and two full design charge explosion tests. The hydrostatic pressure test provided an initial static check on the capacity of the vessel and functioning of the strain <b>instrumentation.</b> The pneumatic <b>air</b> leak tests were performed before, in between, and after the explosion tests.

40|$|The Dissertation {{submitted}} to the Department of Management of Technology for the MBA in Management of TechnologyDepending on the country an aircraft belongs to, and depending on the airline safety politic, {{the safety of a}} flight varies. Most of the airlines comply with the basic safety standards required by the ICAO. Among these airlines, some have decided to comply with their own safety standards (in addition to safety standards required by the ICAO) and increase their safety level, although costs are higher. There are many factors that contribute to the safety rating of an airline including, but not limited to, accident history, maintenance and operational procedures, types of training programs, age of fleet, management, and specific routes flown. In addition, many accidents are caused by circumstances beyond the control of the airline, including, operations and <b>instrumentation</b> at airports. <b>Air</b> Traffic Controller errors, collisions with other aircraft that are at fault, sabotage, manufacturer's design flaws, weather or just plain bad luck.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present the current status of the {{development}} of the Safety and Tritium Applied Research (STAR) Facility at the Idaho National Engineering and Environmental Laboratory (INEEL). Designated a National User Facility by the US DOE, the primary mission of STAR is to provide laboratory infrastructure to study tritium science and technology issues associated with the development of safe and environmentally friendly fusion energy. Both tritium and non-tritium fusion safety research is pursued along three key thrust areas: (1) plasma-material interactions of plasma-facing component (PFC) materials exposed to energetic tritium and deuterium ions, (2) fusion safety concerns related to PFC material chemical reactivity and dust/debris generation, activation product mobilization, and tritium behavior in fusion systems, and (3) molten salts and fusion liquids for tritium breeder and coolant applications. STAR comprises a multi-room complex with operations segregated to permit both tritium and non-tritium activities in separately ventilated rooms. Tritium inventory in STAR is limited to 15, 000 Ci to maintain its classification as a Radiological Facility. Experiments with tritium are typically conducted in glovebox environments. Key components of the tritium infrastructure have been installed and tested. This includes the following subsystems: (1) a tritium Storage and Assay System (SAS) that uses two 50 -g depleted uranium beds for tritium storage and PVT/beta-scintillation analyses for tritium accountability measurements, (2) a Tritium Cleanup System (TCS) that uses catalytic oxidation and molecular sieve water absorption to remove tritiated species from glovebox atmosphere gases and gaseous effluents from experiment and process systems, and (3) tritium monitoring <b>instrumentation</b> for room <b>air,</b> glovebox atmosphere and stack effluent tritium concentration measurements. Integration of the tritium infrastructure subsystems with the experimental and laboratory process systems is planned for early in 2004. Following an operational readiness review, tritium operations will be initiated in the summer of 2004. Summary results of the performance testing of the tritium infrastructure subsystems and their integration into the laboratory operations will be presented at this conference. Current research activity includes plasma-material interaction studies with the Tritium Plasma Experiment (TPE) and tritium/chemistry interactions in the molten salt designated as Flibe (2 ·LiF-BeF 2).

40|$|Irradiated {{nuclear fuel}} {{reprocessing}} to recover 235 U and 80 Kr {{began at the}} INEEL in 1953. The resulting acidic high-level liquid radioactive waste (HLW) was stored in stainless steel tanks in underground concrete vaults. A fluidized-bed calcination process was developed during the 1950 s to form a granular calcine solid from the acidic HLW with a seven-fold volume reduction. An engineering-scale demonstration, the Waste Calcining Facility (WCF) was constructed and operated in 1963. After the successful demonstration of the process, the WCF was continued as a production facility through 1981, Calcining 15, 000 m 3 of HLW to 2, 160 m 3 of calcine. 1 The New Waste Calcining Facility (NWCF) was designed and constructed based on the operating experience of the WCF, and began operation in 1982. With a rated capacity of 3, 000 gallons/day, the NWCF continued waste processing operations through May of 2000, resulting in an additional 2, 226 m 3 of calcine (total current inventory of 4, 386 m 3). 2 During waste processing at the NWCF, sodium-bearing waste (SBW) from decontamination activities was blended with HLW to minimize alkali (sodium and potassium) concentrations in the calciner feed solution. This was necessary due to the propensity of sodium and potassium nitrates to melt in the calciner, causing the bed to agglomerate and interfere with fluidization. However, {{near the end of}} HLW processing, work was initiated to modify the calcination process to treat SBW directly, blending it with chemical additives such as aluminum nitrate rather than lower alkali content HLW liquids. The result of this development effort was to increase the operating temperature of the calciner from 500 °C to 600 °C. The 600 °C SBW flowsheet was successfully demonstrated at the NWCF during two separate trials during 1999 and 2000. 3, 4 The conclusion from these demonstrations was that operating the existing NWCF at 600 °C is a viable method for solidifying SBW, and this concept is currently being evaluated as one option for preparing the SBW for disposal. To restart the NWCF for SBW processing, applicable environmental waste processing and/or air permits will be required. It is anticipated that the NWCF will be regulated as an incinerator; thus, compliance with maximum achievable control technology (MACT) emission limits will be required. To meet these stringent standards, an upgrade to the off-gas treatment train will be required. Specifically, emission of CO, total hydrocarbons (THC), and mercury must be mitigated.
