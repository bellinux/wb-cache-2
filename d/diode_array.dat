50|$|An acousto-optical {{spectrometer}} (AOS) {{is based}} on the diffraction of light by ultrasonic waves. A piezoelectric transducer, driven by the RF signal (from the receiver), generates an acoustic wave in a crystal (the so-called Bragg-cell). This acoustic wave modulates the refractive index and induces a phase grating. The Bragg-cell is illuminated by a collimated laser beam. The angular dispersion of the diffracted light represents a true image of the IF-spectrum according to the amplitude and wavelengths of the acoustic waves in the crystal.

These reflected partial beams superimpose which results in an interference spectrum that is detected using a <b>diode</b> <b>array</b> spectrometer.Through chemical modification the upper SiO2 layer is changed {{in a way to}} allow interaction with target molecules. This interaction causes a change in the thickness of the physical layer d and the refractive index n within this layer.

Monitoring this change over time allows to observe the binding behaviour of the target molecules.|$|E
