25|$|The {{accident}} {{was one of}} a series suffered by Bristow helicopters in the North Sea in just over a year. This included the 12 August 1981 loss of another Bell 212 and the 13 August 1981 loss of a Westland Wessex. Soon after the crash, former Labour Secretary of State for Social Services David Ennals called for a Trade Department inquiry into the safety of helicopter operations in the North Sea oil industry. The accident brought the total number of dead from North Sea <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> by all UK operators to 40 at that time.|$|E
25|$|Total British Commonwealth {{military}} {{casualties were}} 114 killed and 181 wounded, {{most of them}} Gurkhas. Gurkha losses were 43 killed and 83 wounded, losses among other British armed forces were 19 killed and 44 wounded. Australian casualties were 16 killed, of whom 7 were killed in action, and 9 wounded. New Zealand casualties were 7 killed and another 7 wounded or injured. The remaining casualties were that of the Malaysian military, police, and Border Scouts. A significant number of British casualties occurred during <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents,</b> including a Belvedere crash that killed several SAS commanders and a Foreign Office official, possibly a member of MI6. A Wessex collision also killed several men from 2nd Parachute Battalion, and a Westland Scout crash, on 16 July 1964, near Kluang airfield, killed the two crewmen from 656 Sqn AAC. Finally, in August 1966, there remained two British and two Australian soldiers missing and presumed dead, with the Australians (both from the SASR) probably drowned while crossing a swollen river. The remains of a Royal Marine were recovered some 20 years later. Altogether, 36 civilians were killed, 53 wounded and 4 captured, with most being local inhabitants.|$|E

EHEST features representatives of manufacturers, operators, research organisations, regulators, accident investigators and military from across Europe. To address the specificities of the safety of helicopter operations in Europe, the European members of the IHST have established EHEST in November 2006.The European Helicopter Safety Analysis Team (EHSAT) is the safety team of EHEST. EHSAT has been formed {{with the purpose of}} developing a process for analysis of European <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> and then the performance of the analysis. To tackle the variety of languages used in accident reports and optimise the use of resources, EHSAT has set up seven regional analysis teams across Europe, with the objective of covering more than 89% of the European fleet in 2007. Consolidation of results is performed by EHSAT with the support of EASA.|$|E

50|$|Aberdeen is {{the busiest}} {{heliport}} in the UK with 47,000 flights in 2008 transporting workers {{to and from}} offshore installations on the UKCS. Between 1977 {{and the end of}} 2006, just over 56 million passengers were transported by helicopter from all UK heliports to and from offshore installations on the UKCS. More than 6.5 million sectors were flown, taking nearly 3 million flying hours. During this time, seven fatal <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> claimed the lives of 94 offshore workers and flight crew. Government data for the period 1995 to 2004 show that with the exception of rail, the yearly passenger casualty rate for offshore helicopter travel is much better than most forms of land-based passenger transport and of a similar order to travelling by car. Offshore helicopter passengers are equipped for their journey with survival suits and other aids and undergo survival training.|$|E

40|$|Traditionally {{investigation}} into <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> has focused heavily on building complex, deterministic FE models {{and attempting to}} validate them with {{a small number of}} full size crash tests. One of the major drawbacks of this methodology {{is that it does not}} address the dissimilarity of loads generated in nominally identical crashes. To take into account inherent uncertainties in the helicopter crashes, the classic deterministic approach has been replaced in this work by simulation using stochastic algorithms. The chaotic nature, due to complexity in <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents,</b> requires a much more robust simulation framework to capture a broad spectrum of potential crash scenarios. The thesis aims to investigate <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> resulting from engine failure by using stochastic simulation methods. An innovative, hierarchical block structure for a stochastic simulation is developed for investigating the variability in a full crash event reduced to two phases: flight emergency simulation and structure crash simulation. Non-parametric analysis is performed on the stochastic injury responses which attempt to predict the severity of the occupantâ€™s injuries caused by <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents.</b> The modelling framework establishes correlations between the critical parameters prior to <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> and possible occupant injury metrics. To achieve this aim, various stochastic algorithms are performed throughout the stochastic framework for the typical <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents.</b> An {{investigation into}} <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> after engine failure is investigated by simulating auto-rotational flight within a range of sampled pre-event flight conditions to establish the correlation between initial flight parameters and the impact response. The structural crash simulation uses impact loads randomly selected from within the boundary of the flight simulation results to determine accelerations at the seat position. The potential injury is predicted by the stochastically generated acceleration peak-values the human body is subjected to and is evaluated by the resulting robust solution based on a computational geometry algorithm. A highly flexible, hierarchical, stochastic simulation framework has been established for investigating <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents.</b> It has been demonstrated for the case of complete engine failure during flight leading to autorotation. The significance of this approach is the resulting combination of a complete crash event into a single framework which can be robustly analysed to study the limits of occupant harm. This work will lead to strategies for minimizing occupant harm and maximizing survivability for a wide range of helicopter accident scenarios by both structural modification and flight procedural changes. Some techniques supporting the stochastic analysis are successfully used offering the possibility of projecting the methodology into other engineering domains...|$|E

40|$|Most <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> {{are due to}} {{problems}} concerning flight operations, ground duties (mission planning and preparation), training and instructions. These are key issues within the current (European) strategies for greatly {{reducing the number of}} accidents in the next few years. However, when accidents occur the subsequent investigations should include or at least consider forensic engineering, even if only to eliminate possible causes like material defects, component and systems failures, and design deficiencies. To illustrate this, the present paper discusses five <b>helicopter</b> <b>accidents</b> with evidence of material and/or design deficiencies. The accidents concerned a Sikorsky S- 61 N (1974), an A 9 rospatiale Alouette III (1990), a Westland Lynx SH 14 D (1998), and two AgustaWestland EH 101 s (2004, 2006). 9 2012 Elsevier Ltd.
