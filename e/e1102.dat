5000|$|A boxcab, in {{railroad}} terminology, is {{a locomotive}} {{in which the}} machinery and crew areas are enclosed in a box-like superstructure (from boxcar). It is a term mostly used in North America while in Victoria (Australia), such locomotives have been nicknamed [...] "butterboxes" [...] (Victorian Railways second series [...] "E" [...] Class electric locomotives numbered <b>E1102</b> to E1111). Boxcabs may use any source of power but most are diesel or electric locomotives. Few steam locomotives are so described but the British SR Leader class was a possible exception. Most American boxcabs date from before World War II, when the earliest boxcabs were often termed [...] "oil-electrics" [...] to avoid {{the use of the}} German name [...] "Diesel".|$|E
