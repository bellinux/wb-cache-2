5|$|Candaules {{shows the}} moment at which Gyges, <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> door, first catches sight of Nyssia's naked body. Candaules lies naked in bed, while Nyssia undresses as she prepares to join him, and Gyges tiptoes around the door {{to catch a glimpse}} of her. Nyssia holds a piece of fabric, which forms a {{vertical}} line cutting off the body of Candaules at the top of his legs, invoking a theme of emasculation at the hands of a powerful woman. By positioning the figures in such a way that none are looking out of the picture, and the viewer is directly behind Nyssia, Etty intended that the viewer feel the same sense of voyeurism and intrusion that Gyges would have felt, forced to spy on his master's naked wife against his will and without her knowledge. The cluttered arrangement of drapery and architectural features intentionally exaggerates the claustrophobic and implicitly violent nature of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the loss}} of forts 54, 55 and 57, Krukowiecki was still {{convinced}} that the attack on Wola was a diversion, and refused to grant General Dembiński more reinforcements. Only General Ludwik Bogusławski, commanding officer of the 3rd Infantry Division, disregarded his orders and sent a single battalion of the 10th Line Infantry Regiment to Fort 56 as reinforcements. The battalion was led by Col. Piotr Wysocki, the officer who started the entire November Uprising. Dembiński abandoned Fort 58. Its artillery, along with 12 cannons and six rocket launchers from his reserves, was ordered to take positions {{between the first and}} second lines of defence, in front of Forts 21, 22 and 23. Around 9:00, when Russian forces were preparing to push further into the second line of Polish defences, Brigadier Józef Bem arrived to Wola with his 12 cannon and positioned them not far from the recently-lost Fort 54, right on the flank of Kreutz's infantry and Russian artillery shelling Fort 56. Eight more guns and four rocket launchers arrived to the northern flank of Wola and joined the defence of Fort 58. Around that time the combined artillery forces of both Russian infantry corps shifted their fire to Forts 56, 59 and 23. This time the Poles won the artillery duel. Despite Russian numerical superiority in guns and mortars, the Russian artillery suffered losses and was forced to withdraw, followed by infantry, likewise forced back into <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> captured earthworks. Dembiński did not take advantage of this success, and the Polish infantry remained hidden behind fixed defences.|$|E

25|$|The Pandava {{army was}} {{organised}} by Yudhishthira and Arjuna in the Vajra formation. Because the Pandava army {{was smaller than}} the Kaurava's, they decided to employ the tactic of each warrior engaging as many enemies as possible. This involved an element of surprise, with the bowmen showering arrows <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> frontal attackers. The attackers in the front were equipped with short-range weapons like maces, battle-axes, swords and lances.|$|E
25|$|The 2nd Brigade reached Samawah at 3:00 AM on 30 March, {{expecting to}} assault a trench {{line on the}} eastern {{outskirts}} of the town. Instead, they discovered a sand berm surrounding a landfill, which was not defended by enemy forces. At dawn, the Americans began to advance towards the cement factory and received heavy small arms, mortar, and RPG fire. A sharp firefight developed between the Americans <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> berms in the landfill and railroad track, and the Iraqi forces around the cement factory. An Iraqi sniper fired {{from the top of}} the factory's smokestack until an American soldier fired a TOW missile into the smokestack, collapsing the structure. Lacking smoke shells for their mortars in order to screen their movements, American forces were unable to advance and pulled back to the east. OH-58D Kiowa Warrior helicopters arrived and attacked enemy mortar and RPG teams, and destroyed several technical vehicles. At around 3:00 PM, Navy F/A-18 Hornets arrived on station and bombed a warehouse attached to the cement factory. Fighting around the cement factory died down at nightfall.|$|E

[...] During a debate on child welfare in 1949, Dawson ruled comments by Alberta Liberal Leader James Harper Prowse unparliamentary. Prowse had said: [...] "Members of the Government, not content with <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> skirts of unfortunate women, now cloak themselves behind the diapers of more unfortunate babies." [...] Dawson had also ruled other terms, such as [...] "trickery" [...] and [...] "deaf", unparliamentary during his time as speaker.|$|E

500|$|Small Time Crooks starred Grant, in {{the words}} of film critic Andrew Sarris, as [...] "a petty, petulant, faux-Pygmalion art dealer, David, [...] is one of the sleaziest and most unsympathetic {{characters}} Mr. Allen has ever created." [...] In a role devoid of his comic attributes, the New York Times wrote: [...] "Mr. Grant deftly imbues his character with exactly a perfect blend of charm and nasty calculation." [...] A year later, his turn as a charming but womanising book publisher Daniel Cleaver in Bridget Jones's Diary (2001) was proclaimed by Variety to be [...] "as sly an overthrow of a star's polished posh – and nice – poster image as any comic turn in memory". The film, adapted from Helen Fielding's novel of the same name, was an international hit, earning $281million worldwide. Grant was, according to the Washington Post, fitting as [...] "a cruel, manipulative cad, <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> male god's countenance that he knows all too well".|$|E
500|$|The next broad debate, {{with the}} same five {{candidates}} as the LSE debate, in the campaign came on LBC on 22 March. Khan and Goldsmith were accused of immature insults when discussing Goldsmith's plan to allow electric cars to use bus lanes During April, further debates occurred, with the first on 12 April a head-to-head between Goldsmith and Khan on behalf of City A.M.. The issue of Goldsmith's campaign was raised, with Khan accusing Goldsmith of running a negative campaign and Goldsmith accusing Khan of <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> label of Islamophobia. The topics of housing, transport and job-creation were all key points in the debate. [...] The BBC hosted a debate with the five major candidates broadcast on BBC One in London on 18 April. The Guardian noted an absence of any clear winner, with Khan and Goldsmith focused on each other, Berry and Pidgeon offering very similar policies and Whittle distinct but with no chance of victory. Similarly, The Spectator said {{that there had been}} a lukewarm response to policy statements from all candidates. A second head to head took place on 21 April chaired by Kirsty Wark at the Royal Geographical Society on behalf of the Evening Standard. Once again, housing, security and transport were key themes in the debate.|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{had brought}} Quatermass's story {{to a close}} in the 1979 serial Quatermass, and for many years {{saw no reason to}} revisit the character. However, in 1995 he was {{approached}} by BBC radio producer Paul Quinn with an idea for creating a drama-documentary about the character as part of a season of BBC radio programming looking back at the 1950s. Quinn told Dreamwatch magazine, [...] "For many people who remember the seminal experience of <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> sofa when the Quatermass serials came on the television, Quatermass was the 1950s. His adventures [...] have gone down in popular cultural history." [...] Kneale was intrigued by the idea, and agreed to write new dramatic material of Quatermass relating his memories which Quinn could then combine with archive clips from the existing episodes of the various Quatermass television serials. Kneale saw the older Quatermass of this new serial as [...] "the same very concerned scientist who is now, in retrospect, horribly worried about what he may have done to the world through his encounters with various lifeforms that were better not contacted". It was Kneale's first radio work since he had written the play You Must Listen for the BBC in 1952, and his first work for the BBC in any medium since the mid-1970s.|$|E

2500|$|The KlangBogen Wien Festival {{commissioned}} Austrian {{film and}} theatre director Michael Schottenberg {{to rewrite the}} operetta's book for its performance at the 2005 festival. Although Schottenberg's re-working remains faithful to the basic plot and retains most of the original dialogue, the setting was changed to Vienna in the 1950s. The Graf von Luxemburg is now René Graf, a struggling novelist whose nickname is [...] "The Count". His bohemian friend Manfred (Armand in the original) is a student, while their beloveds, Angelika (Angèle) and Julie (Juliette), are dancers in a sleazy Hawaiian revue. Prince Basilowitsch is now Dr. Basil Basilovich-Kokosov, the Russian consul to Vienna, who is saddled with an estranged nymphomaniac wife, Anastasia. René and Angelika's sham wedding takes place in Manfred's bathroom, with René <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> shower curtain. Larry L. Lash, who reviewed the live performance for Opera News wrote that the production [...] "zipped along with a manic 'Springtime for Hitler' fall-out-of-your-seat humor that had me laughing out loud for days after." [...] Immediately following the festival performances at the Theater an der Wien, Schottenberg's production transferred to the Vienna Volksoper where it remained in repertory as of 2011.|$|E
2500|$|The left {{battalion}} of the 7th Texas Infantry, and the 3rd Tennessee Infantry, wild with their easy {{victory over the}} 23rd Indiana Infantry, had pushed across the creek and past the 20th Ohio in a wave, encountering the Union battle line still standing in the woods. [...] For a few minutes, the Union line and Confederate line stood obscured in the thick woods and smoke and killed each other at short range, [...] "both lines [...] equally firm; both equally determined as a couple of bulldogs engaged in a death struggle". Just after Force returned to the creek bed, the Federal line was ordered to leave the woods {{for the safety of}} the fence line, allowing the Union commanders to sort out what had happened. [...] In executing this movement, Colonel Richards was lost, and with him Manning Force's desperate plea for assistance. The Confederates, perceiving that the Federals were withdrawing, imagined that the Federal line was being forced back. [...] The rebels pushed forward with vigor, only to be ripped apart by a volley from federal troops now <b>hiding</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> fence. [...] Aggravating the situation for the Confederates was the fact that the 31st Illinois, hearing the fighting erupt behind them, had merely to about-face from their position on the Union right flank, and step forward in line a few yards before they were in firing position to enfilade the line of the 3rd Tennessee Infantry.|$|E
