The film was partially choreographed by Astaire's long-time friend and collaborator Hermes Pan, who was fired by Coppola during filming.

25|$|Jean Léchelle or Jean L'Échelle (2 April 1760 – 11 November 1793) briefly {{commanded}} a French army during the French Revolutionary Wars. Having {{served in the}} French Royal Army as a youth, {{the outbreak of the}} French Revolution found him employed as a fencing master. He was elected to lead a volunteer National Guard battalion which fought at Valmy and Jemappes in 1792. He earned promotion to general officer after distinguishing himself at the Siege of Valenciennes and saving a representative from an angry mob. He won such favor with the politicians and the war office that he was rapidly catapulted into command of an army in the War in the Vendée. After the capable battalion leader demonstrated his total unfitness for the post of army commander, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> quickly arrested and thrown into prison where he died, a probable suicide.|$|E
25|$|Grant {{took great}} pride in being a Mitchell, his late father had a local {{reputation}} as a boxer. He always strived {{to live up to}} the family name and enjoyed the reputation he inherited and maintained. While Grant liked to think of himself as indestructible, he at many times showed emotional vulnerability and a need to be mothered. Indeed, at times <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> likely to burst into tears as he was to throw a punch. Because of this, he attracted many women, despite the fact that he often treated them as possessions, disregarding their feelings and eliciting exaggerated revenge should they cross him (resulting in spousal abuse and the destruction of all three of his marriages). His quick temper was off-set by a period of genuine remorse and promises that he would change. However, more often than not, Grant reverted to form and when placed under pressure he seemed incapable of controlling his aggression, disregarding all consequences.|$|E

25|$|Although Lalonde is best-remembered {{today as}} a hockey player, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> {{prominent}} in lacrosse, which {{in the early years}} of the 20th century was one of the most popular professional sports in Canada. Lalonde earned more in lacrosse than he did in hockey. He started play in 1905 as a goaltender, but moved to the attack position in 1910, becoming the sport's greatest star. He would break the scoring record for his Montreal team in 1910 with 31 goals. In 1912, he was signed to be player-manager of the Toronto Lacrosse Club, but almost immediately changed his mind and joined the exodus of players heading west for big contracts. He was signed by Con Jones to play for Vancouver for $5,500 for one season. In comparison, as a hockey player, his salary in 1910–11 for the Montreal Canadiens was $1,300, which was considered high for the time. As late as 1920 he could not get more than $2,000 a year playing hockey. Lalonde scored an incredible 66 goals for the Montreal Nationals in 1914.|$|E
25|$|Preston Manning {{denied that}} he and most Reformers based their {{policies}} on intolerant views, but admitted that the Reform Party's populism had in inadvertent effect of drawing in some intolerant people whom Manning claimed he had always sought {{to keep out of}} the Reform Party. Manning claimed that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> committed to purging extremists from the Reform Party as his father Ernest Manning had done as Alberta Social Credit Party leader, in purging anti-Semites from Social Credit. Manning stated that during the 1988 election he was faced with such an extremist who had joined the Reform Party named Doug Collins who was seeking nomination as a Reform candidate, Manning was faced by calls by many Reform Party supporters themselves who condemned Collins as being racist and said that they would leave the party if he were nominated. Manning responded by sending a letter to the constituency association which called for all candidates to accept the Reform Party's denouncement of racism and demanded that Collins accept this, Collins and his supporters refused and he subsequently failed to win the nomination.|$|E

Other coaches and sportswriters of his era were united in their puzzlement that anyone could coach with such a light hand and still win so many games. However, Coach Dodd knew that his [...] "Books First" [...] reputation caused parents to favor Georgia Tech over his competition. Georgia Tech often played teams that were physically superior but Bobby Dodd would still find a way win.

500|$|Cotton's sentiments were {{strongly}} anti-Catholic, clearly {{evident in his}} writings. [...] This led him to oppose the established English church, which had separated from the Catholic church in name only, in his view and that of most other Puritans. [...] The English church had an [...] "officially sanctioned form of worship and an established ecclesiastical structure." [...] He felt that the Anglican church polity and ceremonies, {{like those of the}} Catholics, were not authorized by scripture. [...] Cotton and others wanted to purify such practices and were pejoratively labelled as [...] "puritans," [...] a term that stuck. He [...] was opposed to the essence of the established church, yet <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> opposed to separating from it because he viewed the Puritan movement as a way to change the church from within.|$|E

[...] However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity. [...] Actress May Fortescue recalled, [...] "His kindness was extraordinary.

2500|$|Debussy's {{great service}} to music was to reawaken among all musicians an {{awareness}} of harmony and its possibilities. In that, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> important as Beethoven, who revealed to us the possibilities of progressive form, or as Bach, who showed us the transcendent significance of counterpoint. Now, what I am always asking myself is this: {{is it possible to}} make a synthesis of these three great masters, a living synthesis that will be valid for our time? [...] Debussy's influence is present in the Fourteen Bagatelles (1908). These made Ferruccio Busoni exclaim 'At last something truly new!' [...] Until 1911, Bartók composed widely differing works which ranged from adherence to romantic-style, to folk song arrangements and to his modernist opera Bluebeard's Castle. The negative reception of his work led him to focus on folk music research after 1911 and abandon composition with the exception of folk music arrangements ( [...] ; [...] ).|$|E
2500|$|Although {{the story}} of a {{frustrated}} passion for Baron von Bleichröder has gained traction in newspapers and history books, at least one book described an entirely different story. [...] In Secrets of Dethroned Royalty by Princess Catherine Radziwill (1920), it is explained that Sophie, required by her family's financial circumstances to live in the university town of Heidelberg instead of the metropolis of Weimar, had fallen deeply in love with a young man (identified only as [...] "Count T.") of excellent but poor family. [...] The two young people planned to elope and to conceal their plans, the princess pretended to carry on a romance instead with one of her sweetheart's friends, Baron von Bleichröder, [...] "who consented with alacrity to play the part ... for he was flattered by the request to appear before the world as a suitor for the hand of a Princess of Weimar." [...] However, Prince William and Princess Gerta intended on another match (presumably more prosperous) for their daughter, and they persuaded Count T to leave Heidelberg. [...] Count T secretly arranged to continue to exchange love letters with Sophie using Bleichröder as intermediary. [...] However after the passage of time the Count, living in another city, found an heiress to his liking, and married her. [...] Apparently he had not bothered to notify Sophie of these changes in his feelings and she discovered these developments only by reading of his marriage in a newspaper; she was so distraught that she killed herself that night. [...] It was widely but erroneously believed that she was driven to suicide by the presumed opposition of her parents to Bleichröder, who, for his part, did not attempt to correct that impression [...] "with evident satisfaction [...] the prestige he derived from his position as the man for whose sake a Royal Princess had shot herself. [...] This awful catastrophe ... was for the Hebrew banker's son, merely a triumph of vanity, and he was glad to allow the world to think she had died for him." [...] This version has not received any currency, although a different story, to the effect that the Princess had previously been carrying on a doomed romance with a Lt. Edler Herr von Putlitz, has circulated. [...] The romance was doomed because although von Putlitz came from a family as aristocratic as that of the Princess, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> poor as her father. However, Lt. von Putlitz had died (possibly by suicide) in 1908.|$|E
