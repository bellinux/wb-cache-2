30|$|A slight {{reduction}} of stiffness {{has been reported}} upon crosslinking sericin with <b>dimethylolurea</b> (Nagura et al. 2001) or upon crosslinking the blend BMSF/BMSS 90 / 10 with either genipin or poly(ethylene glycol) diglycidyl ether (PEG-DE) (Motta et al. 2011), which has been explained, respectively, either by an effect {{of the change in}} the water content of the films (which in its turn depends on the crosslinking degree) or as a consequence of pore formation due to the removal of sericin by alcohol treatment. In our study, however, the membranes were not subjected to alcohol treatment prior to testing. With regards to the water content (WC) of BMSF/BMSS 50 / 50 samples, we measured 58.51 %[*]±[*] 0.92 % for the crosslinked one and 52.57 %[*]±[*] 3.54 % for the uncrosslinked water-annealed sample, respectively. However, this difference did not affect the stiffness of the membranes. For comparison, the measured WCs of pure fibroin (sample 1) and of pure sericin (sample 5) were 36.01 %[*]±[*] 1.70 % and 53.37 %[*]±[*] 2.53 %, respectively.|$|E
