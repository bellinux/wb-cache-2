The highlands of Kilimanjaro region have always provided enough water flows to enable the implementation of traditional irrigation systems that the local people have used. This system threatened by decreasing water flows due to land degradation. The Government of Tanzania, {{with support from the}} Global Environment Facility (GEF) through UNDP is implementing a 4 -year project aimed at reducing land degradation on the highlands of the Kilimanjaro Region. The Project intends to reverse this trend by reviving and improving the traditional irrigation system with low-cost drip irrigation <b>demonstration</b> <b>schemes</b> that take into account income generation and climate change adapted. As such, low-cost drip irrigation demonstration plots established in Same, Mwanga, Moshi, and Hai districts.

Water use efficiency (WUE) in relation to furrow irrigation methods revealed that WUE was significantly higher by drip irrigation system. Results obtained prove the water savings range from 44 % in Kisangesangeni and Longoi A to 58 % in Mabilioni. Farmers were eager to implement the technology after getting training although initial installation cost is high.

40|$|Rapid {{change in}} the energy market {{brought on by the}} 1970 s energy crises signalled the need for the UK Government to {{intervene}} in matters of energy use. The resulting programme of public Research, Development and Demonstration (RD&D) for industry persisted {{until the end of the}} 1980 s. The authors investigated the impact of the Government's programme for industrial energy efficiency RD&D in this period. In a bottom-up/top-down comparison, it was found that public RD&D contributed significantly to the fall in industrial energy demand in the 1980 s. The overall effectiveness of the government intervention is discussed with focus given to the Energy Efficiency Demonstration Scheme. This particular scheme is a good example of public-private collaboration in technology transfer and its effect was found to be a close representation of overall public RD&D impact on industrial energy use.

40|$|Telecare' {{involves}} the use of information and communications technologies to provide support for vulnerable individuals living in the community. The UK government wishes to make telecare available in all homes that need it by 2010. This expansion is seen as central to the improvement of older people's independence and quality of life by enabling them to live at home whenever possible. The paper discusses the range of initiatives now in place to facilitate the introduction of telecare in the UK. It argues that while there is now experience of telecare through pilot and <b>demonstration</b> <b>schemes,</b> moving to mainstream service delivery is far from straightforward. Using a case study of a telecare scheme, along with supplementary data from other schemes, the paper explores the reasons why it may be hard to meet government objectives. These include the organisational and cultural characteristics of local care institutions and the complexity of scheme objectives. It draws conclusions on the challenges in meeting aspirations for mass telecare over the next decade and on the future role of the housing stock in care provision. © 2005 Taylor & Francis Group Ltd...|$|E

40|$|Entanglement {{distribution}} between distant {{parties is}} an essential component to most quantum communication protocols. Unfortunately, decoherence effects such as phase noise in optical fibers are known to demolish entanglement. Iterative (multistep) entanglement distillation protocols have long been proposed to overcome decoherence, but their probabilistic nature makes them inefficient since the success probability decays exponentially {{with the number of}} steps. Quantum memories have been contemplated to make entanglement distillation practical, but suitable quantum memories are not realised to date. Here, we present the theory for an efficient iterative entanglement distillation protocol without quantum memories and provide a proof-of-principle experimental <b>demonstration.</b> The <b>scheme</b> is applied to phase-diffused two-mode-squeezed states and proven to distill entanglement for up to three iteration steps.

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{generating}} positrons has been pro-posed that uses betatron X-rays emitted by an electron beam in a high-K plasma wiggler. The plasma wiggler is an ion column {{produced by the}} head of the beam when the peak beam density exceeds the plasma density. The radial electric field of the beam blows out the plasma electrons transversely, creating an ion column. The focusing electric field of the ion column causes the beam electrons to exe-cute betatron oscillations about the ion column axis. At the proper plasma density, this leads to synchrotron radiation in the 1 - 50 MeV range. These photons strike a thin (. 5 Xo), high-Z target and create electron-positron pairs.
