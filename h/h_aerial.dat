40|$|Bostrichthys sinensis inhabits {{brackish}} water, {{living in}} the crevices of the river mouths of Shang Xi and Guangdong, China. In its natural habitat, it may encounter aerial exposure frequently during low tides, and it usually remains quiescent {{in the absence of}} water. Upon aerial exposure in the laboratory, the ammonia excretion rate decreased to one-fourth that of the submerged control. Although all the enzymes of the ornithine-urea cycle were detected in the liver of this fish, the activity of hepatic carbamoyl phosphate synthetase was too low for the cycle to be functioning. Indeed, ammonia accumulated in the tissues and was not converted to urea. Results indicate that ammonia produced through amino acid catabolism was detoxified to glutamine during the first 24 <b>h</b> of <b>aerial</b> exposure. The excess amount of glutamine stored in the muscle during this period couldaccount approximately for the reduction in ammonia equivalent excreted. There was indeed {{a significant increase in the}} activity of glutamine synthetase from the liver of specimens exposed to terrestrial conditions. In contrast to the production of alanine, formation of glutamine is energetically expensive. Since B. sinensis remained relatively inactive on land, the reduction in energy demand for muscular activity might provide it with the opportunity to exploit glutamine formation as a means to detoxify ammonia. After 72 <b>h</b> of <b>aerial</b> exposure, B. sinensis reduced internal ammonia production, possibly through reductions in proteolysis and amino acid catabolism, to avoid excessive accumulation of ammonia. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Mutations are {{the cause}} of innate {{metabolic}} defects in cellular system, triggering morbidity and mortality in living organisms. Since the mutagens {{are involved in the}} initiation and promotion of several human diseases, including cancer, the significance of novel bioactive phytocompounds in counteracting these pro-mutagenic and carcinogenics effects is now gaining attention. The aims of this study are to evaluate the phytochemical constituent, to determine the antioxidant capacity and to determine the mutagenic effect and antimutagenic potential in the absence and presence of metabolic activation (S 9) in the plants extracts. In these study two samples namely H. bonariensis and C. asiatica aerial parts and roots in aqueous and methanol extracts were used to determine its bioactive compound via phytochemical screening and antioxidant capacity using the FRAP assay. Determination of the mutagenic effect and antimutagenic potential for both plants species were done using the Ames test after the bacterial strains fulfill the genotype characteristics needed. The finding revealed that both plants extract possessed alkaloid, phenol and tannins on its phythochemical content except for flavonoid which was only found in methanol extracts of <b>H.</b> bonariensis <b>aerial</b> parts. In the FRAP assay, both plants extracts showed antioxidant power. The results indicated that both methanol extracts of <b>H.</b> bonariensis <b>aerial</b> parts and methanol extracts of C. asiatica aerial parts and roots contain strong antioxidant power with high value of ascorbic acid equivalent. In the mutagenicity study, the methanol extracts of the <b>aerial</b> parts of <b>H.</b> bonariensis showed significant different (p respectively. In conclusion, both extracts of H. bonariensis and C. asiatica aerial parts and roots have alkaloid, phenol and tannins and also antioxidant capacity which possibly contribute to the antimutagenic potential against direct mutagen by both plants species.

40|$|The weather loach Misgurnus anguillicaudatus {{is a small}} {{freshwater}} fish that lives in rice fields. It is capable of using its intestine as an additional respiratory organ (McMahon and Burggren, 1987) to breathe air. It can gulp air, pass it through the digestive tract and release it from the vent. This enables it to live in oxygen-poor waters or to bury itself in mud during long-lasting droughts in the summer. When {{there is a lack}} of water, it will bury and position itself in the soft mud such that the mouth has access to air through a small opening, the fish gulping air occasionally and respiring through its intestine.

40|$|We use two {{experiments}} {{to assess the}} role of anthropogenic activities in disseminating the invasive alga, Caulerpa taxifolia. First, we tested {{the hypothesis that the}} removal of fragments of C. taxifolia from an estuary would be dependent on anchor type (sand versus rock) and anchor attachment (chain versus rope). Second, we hypothesised that the viability of different sized clumps (1, 5 and 10 g dry weight) of C. taxifolia would be dependent on <b>aerial</b> exposure (1 <b>h,</b> 1 day and 3 days) and environmental conditions (sun versus shade, damp rope versus no rope). Fragments of C. taxifolia were consistently removed by anchors regardless of the anchor type; overall, 82 % of anchors lowered into C. taxifolia beds removed fragments. Rock and sand anchors removed similar sized clumps of C. taxifolia (up to 15 g dry weight), while chain attachments removed significantly larger clumps compared to ropes (up to 0. 5 g dry weight). Once removed from the water, fragment survivorship increased with clump size, protection from desiccation (i. e. greatest under damp shaded ropes) and decreased with length of aerial exposure. Most shaded clumps survived 1 <b>h</b> of <b>aerial</b> exposure, while none, irrespective of their size, survived 3 days. Our study confirms that the anchoring of vessels removes fragments of C. taxifolia from estuaries and that conditions inside anchor lockers may enhance fragment survivorship.

In this study two procedures for updating stand level inventory data were developed and tested. The {{development of the}} growing stock of 62 stands over 12 years was simulated in the MELA stand simulator with no prior information of rapid changes, such as clear-cuttings. The acceptability of the simulation was decided standwise with visual interpretation of aerial false-colour photographs. If the simulated data were not accepted, new stand attributes were assessed with photo interpretation in procedure 1. In procedure 2, on the other hand, {{it was possible to}} utilise old management proposals. In case a cutting or other operation had been proposed and it looked like the operation had been realised, the interpreters accepted the proposal. Otherwise the last implemented operation and implementation year were interpreted. In case no operation had been carried out during the updating period but the growth model updated data were not acceptable, the same stand characteristics were estimated as in procedure 1. Stands where a proposal had been accepted or an operation interpreted were later updated again in MELA so that the program simulated the operations. The Root Mean Squared Errors of stem volume were 62 and 57 m 3 per ha (34 and 30 %) with procedures 1 and 2.

Materials and methods First, the effects of acute and 14 -d oral administrations of an extract derived from <b>H.</b> connatum <b>aerial</b> parts were studied using the Escape Deficit (ED) test. Next, methanol-extracted flavonoid-enriched fractions B and C and fraction-purified flavonoids (quercetin, rutin and isoquercitrin) were evaluated in the ED test after acute administration. To rule out possible confounding effects of the flavonoids, we examined nociceptive threshold using the tail-flick test and anxious behaviour using the elevated plus maze (EPM) test. ResultsHypericum connatum increased reactivity of unavoidable stress-exposed rats after acute (0. 5 and 1 g/kg: ED = 18. 6 / 30 and 19. 8 / 30, respectively) and repeated administration (0. 5 g/kg twice daily: ED = 17. 8 / 30). Protective effects were observed for fractions B and C (250 mg/kg: ED = 18. 1 / 30 and 18. 8 / 30, respectively), quercetin (2. 5, 5 and 10 mg/kg: ED = 15. 3 / 30, 18. 3 / 30 and 21. 6 / 30, respectively), rutin (5 and 10 mg/kg: ED = 15. 4 / 30 and 13. 0 / 30, respectively) and isoquercitrin (2. 5 mg/kg: ED = 19. 2 / 30).

40|$|Delayed {{hatching}} {{is a form}} of dormancy {{evolved in}} some amphibian and fish embryos to cope with environmental conditions transiently hostile to the survival of hatchlings or larvae. While diapause and cryptobiosis have been extensively studied in several animals, very little is known concerning the molecular mechanisms involved in the sensing and response of fish embryos to environmental cues. Embryos of the euryhaline killifish Fundulus heteroclitus advance dvelopment when exposed to air but hatching is suspended until flooding with seawater. Here, we investigated how transcriptome regulation underpins this adaptive response by examining changes in gene expression profiles of aerially incubated killifish embryos at ∼ 100 % relative humidity, compared to embryos continuously flooded in water. The results confirm that mid-gastrula embryos are able to stimulate development in response to aerial incubation, which is accompanied by the differential expression of at least 806 distinct genes during a 24 h period. Most of these genes (∼ 70 %) appear to be differentially expressed within 3 <b>h</b> of <b>aerial</b> exposure, suggesting a broad and rapid transcriptomic response. This response seems to include an early sensing phase, which overlaps with a tissue remodeling and activation of embryonic development phase involving many regulatory and metabolic pathways. Interestingly, we found fast (0. 5 - 1 h) transcriptional differences in representatives of classical "stress" proteins, such as some molecular chaperones, members of signalling pathways typically involved in the transduction of sensor signals to stress response genes, and oxidative stress-related proteins, similar to that described in other animals undergoing dormancy, diapause or desiccation. To our knowledge, these data represent the first transcriptional profiling of molecular processes associated with desiccation resistance during delayed hatching in non-mammalian vertebrates. The exceptional transcriptomic plasticity observed in killifish embryos provides an important insight as to how the embryos are able to rapidly adapt to non-lethal desiccation conditions...|$|R

40|$|CONTEXT: The {{search for}} {{bioactive}} compounds from botanical sources is attracting much interest. However, differences in chemical composition may occur {{within the same}} species depending on different geographical origins. OBJECTIVES: We evaluated the properties on skin enzymes and cells of extracts from sulla legume crop Hedysarum coronarium L. (Fabaceae), collected at two Italian sites near Pisa and Ventimiglia, for possible dermatological and cosmetic applications. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Plant aerial portions were extracted in MTBE/ethyl acetate/acetone, obtaining two extracts named Pisa sulla extract (PSE) and Ventimiglia sulla extract (VSE). Extracts were subjected to chemical characterization, LC-MS/MS analysis and biological assays. RESULTS: PSE showed stronger antiradical scavenging and higher phenolic and flavonoid contents with respect to VSE. LC-MS/MS analysis revealed similar composition for the two extracts, but PSE was richer in condensed tannins and flavonoids, principally rhoifolin, quercetin, naringenin and derivatives. PSE induced stronger inhibition on collagenase and elastase by in vitro enzyme assays, possibly due {{to higher levels of}} condensed tannins and quercetin. ELISA bioassay on human dermal fibroblasts revealed stronger PSE induction of collagen production. Determination of glycerol release from adipocytes disclosed stronger stimulation of lipolysis by PSE, allegedly ascribed to higher charge of quercetin and derivatives. In summary, the higher richness in phenolics of PSE is strictly related to stronger bioactivity. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Data indicate that <b>aerial</b> <b>H.</b> coronarium material is suitable for the development of dermatological and cosmeceutical products, but the geographical origin is an important factor for maximally exploiting the biological properties of this species...|$|R

The LC 50 (lethal concentration to kill 50 % of the population) values of essential oils from A. dracunculus, A. millefolium and H. persicum were 22. 24, 34. 80 and 36. 96 µl/ l after 24 h fumigation, respectively. On the other hand, A. dracunculus oil was more effective than the other essential oils against P. interpunctella adults. The LC 50 values decreased with increasing of exposure times. In all cases, considerable differences in the mortality of insect to essential oils were observed with different concentrations and exposure times. These results suggest that the essential oils of A. millefolium, A. dracunculus and H. persicum have merit further studies as potential fumigants for the management of P. interpunctella or probably other stored-product insects...|$|R
40|$|Plukenetia volubilis ? esp?cie que necessita de sele??o para permitir a explora??o {{comercial}} da cultura, principalmente quanto a qualidade das sementes, pois popula??es com germina??o r?pida e uniforme das sementes, seguida por pronta emerg?ncia das pl?ntulas s?o caracter?sticas altamente desej?veis. Os objetivos do presente trabalho foram estimar par?metros gen?ticos com base em caracteres de desempenho germinativo, inferir sobre a variabilidade gen?tica de sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) e descrever o tipo de germina??o da esp?cie. Foram realizados dois experimentos na Embrapa Amaz?nia Ocidental, em casa de vegeta??o, em duas ?pocas: inverno amaz?nico; temperaturas m?dias m?nimas de 20 oC e m?ximas de 31 oC, 91 % UR, 49 ml de evapora??o mensal e 91 horas mensais de insola??o e ver?o amaz?nico temperaturas m?dias m?nimas de 23 oC e m?ximas de 34 oC, 83 % UR, 67 ml de evapora??o mensal e 179 horas mensais de insola??o. Foram avaliadas em cada ensaio 25 prog?nies de P. volubilis, no delineamento inteiramente casualizado, em 4 repeti??es e 5 sementes por parcela. Foram avaliadas as caracter?sticas: Emerg?ncia de pl?ntulas em substrato (E), primeira contagem de emerg?ncia (PC), ?ndice de velocidade de emerg?ncia (IVE), di?metro do coleto (DC), comprimento do hipoc?tilo (H) e comprimento da parte a?rea de pl?ntulas (CP). Foram realizadas an?lise de vari?ncia individual e conjunta, teste de Scott Knot e estimados par?metros gen?ticos. A emerg?ncia das pl?ntulas ocorreu entre 19 a 41 dias e 25 a 42 dias, respectivamente, nas ?pocas de inverno e ver?o amaz?nico. Nas an?lises de vari?ncia individual e conjunta dos experimentos para PG, IVE e PCP, observou-se efeito significativo (P< 0, 05) dos tratamentos. Na an?lise conjunta verificou-se efeito significativo de ?poca de semeadura e da intera??o gen?tipo x ?poca de semeadura para E, PC e IVE. Os valores de herdabilidade no sentido amplo oscilaram de 7, 551 (CP) a 91, 587 (IVE). A caracter?stica IVE nas an?lises individuais apresentou valores altos de herdabilidade e condi??es favor?veis ? sele??o. A germina??o de P. volubilis pode ser classificada como do tipo ep?gea fanerocotiledonar e as plantas matrizes utilizadas no trabalho apresentam variabilidade gen?tica significativa para os caracteres E, IVE, CP, DC e H indicando a possibilidade de sele??o de prog?nies com caracter?sticas superiores de qualidade de sementes e mudas. Plukenetia volubilis is the specie {{that needs}} selection to enable commercial exploration of culture, especially about seed quality, because populations with rapid and uniform germination of seeds, followed by ready emergence seedling are highly desirable characteristics. The objectives {{of this study}} were to estimate genetic parameters based on germination performance characters, infer on the genetic variability of sacha inchi (Plukenetia volubilis) and describe the type of germination of the specie. Two experiments were conducted at Embrapa Amaz?nia Ocidental in a greenhouse during two periods: Amazon winter, average temperatures minimum and maximum of 68 ?F and 87. 8 ?F, 91 % RH, 49 ml of monthly evaporation and 91 monthly hours of insolation and the Amazon summer average temperatures minimum of 73. 4 ? F and maximum of 93 ?F, 83 % RH, 67 ml of monthly evaporation and 179 hours monthly insolation. 25 progenies of P. volubilis were evaluated in each test, in a completely randomized design in 4 replicates of 5 seeds per plot. The characteristics were evaluated: Emergence seedling substrate (E), Emergence first count (FC), Emergence speed index (ESI), Diameter of the stem (DS), hypocotyl length (<b>H)</b> and <b>aerial</b> length part of seedlings (LS). Individual and joint variance analysis were performed, Scott Knot test and estimate genetic parameters. Seedling leveling occurred between 19 to 41 days and 25 - 42 days, respectively, in Amazon winter and summer seasons. In the analyses of individual and joint variance experiments to E, ESI and FC, there was a significant effect (P < 0. 05) treatments. In the joint analysis there was a significant effect of sowing date and genotype x sowing date for E, FC and ESI. The values of broad-sense heritability ranged from 7. 551 (LS) to 91. 587 (ESI). The ESI characteristics of the individual analysis showed high values of heritability and favorable conditions for selection. The germination of P. volubilis can be classified as the epigeal phanerocotylar and the matrix plants in this study have significant genetic variability for the characters E, ESI, LS, DS and H indicating the possibility for selection of progeny with superior quality seeds and seedlings characteristic...|$|R
