5|$|Commerce {{expanded}} {{after the}} Santa Fe Trail opened in 1822, and {{greater numbers of}} examples survive. Until 1880, all such textiles were blankets as opposed to rugs. In 1850, these <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> trade items sold for $50 in gold, a huge sum at that time.|$|E

5|$|Opus sectile is {{a related}} {{technique}} in which flat stone, usually coloured marble, is cut precisely into shapes from which geometric or figurative patterns are formed. This more difficult technique was <b>highly</b> <b>prized,</b> and became especially popular for luxury surfaces in the 4th century, an abundant example {{of which is}} the Basilica of Junius Bassus.|$|E
5|$|The sand whiting is a <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> {{table fish}} often rated {{equal to the}} King George whiting, making it a common target for both {{commercial}} and recreational fisheries. The flesh is white, tender and has a moist, low oil content composition, making it easily digestible. Investigations into the aquaculture of the species began in the 1980s, and {{has led to the}} development of farmed sand whiting.|$|E
5|$|Addax {{are easy}} to hunt due to their slow movements. Roadkill, {{firearms}} for easy hunting and nomadic settlements near waterholes (their dry-season feeding places) have also decreased numbers. Moreover, their meat and leather are <b>highly</b> <b>prized.</b> Other threats include chronic droughts in the deserts, habitat destruction due to more human settlements and agriculture. Less than 500 individuals are thought {{to exist in the}} wild today, most of the animals being found between the Termit area of Niger, the Bodélé region of western Chad, and the Aoukar in Mauritania.|$|E

5|$|An English trader, Charles Ledger, and his Amerindian servant {{spent four}} years {{collecting}} cinchona seeds in the Andes in Bolivia, <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> for their quinine but whose export was prohibited. Ledger managed to get seeds out; in 1865, the Dutch government cultivated 20,000 trees of the Cinchona ledgeriana in Java (Indonesia). By {{the end of the}} nineteenth century, the Dutch had established a world monopoly over its supply.|$|E
5|$|Boletus aereus, {{the dark}} cep or bronze bolete, is a <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> and much sought-after edible {{mushroom}} {{in the family}} Boletaceae. The bolete is widely consumed in Spain (Basque Country and Navarre), France, Italy, Greece, and generally throughout the Mediterranean. Described as a new species in 1789 by French mycologist Pierre Bulliard, it {{is closely related to}} several other European boletes, including B.reticulatus, B.pinophilus, and the popular B.edulis. Some populations in North Africa have been classified as a separate species, B.mamorensis, although they are phylogenetically very close.|$|E
5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, particularly those of Motown, were <b>highly</b> <b>prized.</b> There were also bands on the London pub rock circuit. Occasional R pub rock acts like Dr Feelgood managed to build a following through tireless touring. They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US. With the rise of disco music, British soul music became popular in the mid-late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Zoology is {{discussed}} in Books VIII to XI. The encyclopedia mentions different sources of purple dye, particularly the murex snail, the <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> source of Tyrian purple. It describes the elephant and hippopotamus in detail, {{as well as the}} value and origin of the pearl and the invention of fish farming and oyster farming. The keeping of aquariums was a popular pastime of the rich, and Pliny provides anecdotes of the problems of owners becoming too closely attached to their fish.|$|E
5|$|As the CIP allowed licensees {{to import}} goods at half price, it was {{regarded}} as a virtual guarantee of business success, regardless of entrepreneurial skill. As a result, the licenses were <b>highly</b> <b>prized.</b> For those who were not confident in their sales ability, a healthy profit was usually made by selling their license to other willing businessmen, especially as demand far outstripped supply. A 1966 US Government report concluded {{that it was possible to}} guarantee a 100% domestic profit on piasters, and that a 50% profit could be safely achieved by using black market exchange rates and depositing one's money in an American bank.|$|E
5|$|Horseback {{riding and}} {{mountain}} biking are popular but are only allowed on certain trails. Kayaking is popular along the seacoast {{and in the}} various rivers and streams. Kayakers and canoeists frequently travel the Smith River, which is the longest undammed river remaining in California. Fishing for salmon and steelhead, a <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> anadromous form of rainbow trout over , is best in the Smith and Klamath rivers. A California sport fishing license is required to fish any of the rivers and streams. Hunting is not permitted anywhere in the parks, but is allowed in nearby National Forests.|$|E

5|$|Sacred zebu {{were kept}} in a sunken cattle pen (fahimasina) {{to the west of}} the kianja {{courtyard}} before sacrifice at royal events such as circumcisions and the fandroana festival. Only the two most <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> types of zebu were kept here: black zebu with white markings on the forehead, called volavita, and entirely reddish-brown zebu, called malaza. In this way, the cattle were made to walk from the west toward the east (the direction of the ancestors and sanctity) before being slaughtered. Another large pen for sacrificial zebu was located to the northeast of this courtyard before being filled in by the French Colonial Authority in the late 19th century.|$|E
5|$|The common {{thresher}} {{is widely}} caught by offshore longline and pelagic gillnet fisheries, {{especially in the}} northwestern Indian Ocean, the western, central, and eastern Pacific, and the North Atlantic. Participating countries include the former USSR, Japan, Taiwan, Spain, the United States, Brazil, Uruguay, and Mexico. The meat is <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> for human consumption cooked, dried and salted, or smoked. In addition, their skin is made into leather, their liver oil is processed for vitamins, and their fins are used for shark fin soup. The United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) reported a worldwide common thresher take of 411 metric tons in 2006.|$|E
5|$|The main factor which boosted {{industry}} and trade under the Ayyubids {{was the new}} interests Europeans developed when they {{came into contact with}} the Muslims. Commodities included incense, scents, fragrant oils, and aromatic plants from Arabia and India, as well as ginger, alum, and aloes. Likewise, Europeans developed new tastes in the matter of fashions, clothing, and home furnishing. Rugs, carpets, and tapestries manufactured in the Middle East and Central Asia were introduced to the West through Crusader-Ayyubid interaction. Christian pilgrims visiting Jerusalem returned with Arab reliquaries for the keeping of relics. In addition, eastern works of art in glass, pottery, gold, silver, etc., were <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> in Europe.|$|E

After a little practice I shall {{be able to go}} further and say he did; they will then be the most interesting features of my library's decorations. The Horse-shoe is attracting a good deal of attention, because I have intimated that the conqueror's horse cast it; it will attract more when I get my hand in and say he cast it, I thank you for the pipes and the shoe; and also for the official guide, which I read through at a single sitting. If a person should say that about a book of mine I should regard it as good evidence of the book's interest.|$|R
5|$|With its {{increasing}} rarity, {{specimens of}} the great auk and its eggs became collectible and <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> by rich Europeans, {{and the loss of}} a large number of its eggs to collection contributed to the demise of the species. Eggers, individuals who visited the nesting sites {{of the great}} auk to collect their eggs, quickly realized that the birds did not all lay their eggs on the same day, so they could make return visits to the same breeding colony. Eggers only collected the eggs without embryos and typically, discarded the eggs with embryos growing inside of them.|$|E
5|$|Queen Victoria had {{instructed}} the War Office {{to strike a}} new medal that would not recognise birth or class. The medal {{was meant to be}} a simple decoration that would be <b>highly</b> <b>prized</b> and eagerly sought after by those in the military services. To maintain its simplicity, Queen Victoria, under the guidance of Prince Albert, vetoed the suggestion that the award be called The Military Order of Victoria and instead suggested the name Victoria Cross. The original warrant stated that the Victoria Cross would only be awarded to soldiers who have served in the presence of the enemy and had performed some signal act of valour or devotion. The first ceremony was held on 26 June 1857 at which Queen Victoria invested 62 of the 111 Crimean recipients in a ceremony in Hyde Park, London.|$|E
5|$|The Bilbie {{family of}} bell founders and clockmakers {{lived and worked}} in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years, from the late 17th century until the 19th century. They {{produced}} more than 1,350 church bells, which were hung in churches all over the West Country. Their oldest surviving bell, cast in 1698, is still giving good service in the local St Andrew's Church. The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are <b>highly</b> <b>prized.</b> They are mostly longcase clocks, the cheapest with 30-hour movements in modest oak cases, but some have high quality eight-day movements with additional features, such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks. These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices.|$|E

To the patriotism, the courage, and the sacrifices {{of the people of}} that day, we owe, under Providence, all that we now most <b>highly</b> <b>prize,</b> and what we shall transmit to our children as the richest legacy they can inherit. The War of the Revolution, it has been justly remarked, was not a war of armies merely--it was the war of nearly a whole people, and such a people as the world had never before seen, in a death struggle for liberty.|$|R
