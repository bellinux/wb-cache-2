40|$|Many {{seasonal}} workers {{experience an}} increase in sexual activity whilst employed at a holiday centre. Evidence of sexual risk-taking while at a holiday centre has important social and health implications for purchasers and providers of sexual health services in areas which experience an annual influx of seasonal workers. This research investigates the contraceptive behaviour of seasonal workers and focuses on their access to contraception and sexual health services. In-depth {{interviews were conducted with}} seasonal workers at holiday centres along the south coast of England. Respondents were, interviewed {{at the beginning of the}} season and again, five months later at the end of the season. This longitudinal methodology enabled changes in contraceptive behaviour to be identified as well as the strategies for seeking contraception and sexual health services throughout the season. The results of this study show that there are a range of different motivations which influence seasonal worker' use of contraception and sexual risk-taking while at a holiday centre. Categories of contraceptive protection are developed to assist purchasers and providers to identify the variety of sexual health needs of workers at holiday centres and determine the most effective strategies for delivering contraceptive and sexual health services to these workers. The paper describes the motivations which influence contraceptive use and sexual risk-taking amongst seasonal workers, identifies the contraceptive and sexual health needs of these workers, and discusses the difficulties workers experienced in meeting these needs while at a holiday centre. PIP: This research investigates the contraceptive behavior of seasonal workers at holiday centers along the south coast of England and focuses on their access to contraception and sexual health services. A longitudinal methodology was employed in order to identify the changes in contraceptive behavior, as well as strategies for seeking contraception and sexual health services throughout the season. The results showed a range of different motivations that influenced seasonal workers' use of contraception and sexual risk-taking while at a <b>holiday</b> <b>center.</b> This range includes those who are primarily concerned with pregnancy prevention or the protection against STDs, those whose contraceptive intentions are influenced by alcohol or desire for sexual pleasure, and those whose attitudes towards contraceptive use continually lead to experiences of unsafe sex. Categories of contraceptive protection have been developed to assist purchasers and providers in identifying the variety of sexual health needs of workers at holiday centers. The six styles of protection that describe seasonal workers' practices are: pregnancy prevention, relationship orientated, determined users, situational, passive, and unconcerned. The most effective strategies determined for delivering contraceptive and sexual health services to these workers are information provision and accessibility of contraceptive services...|$|E

25|$|A {{holiday centre}} is a {{facility}} that specializes in providing apartments, chalets and camping pitches for visiting holidaymakers. The center is run commercially, and visitors are not members and have no say in the management. Most <b>holiday</b> <b>centers</b> expect visitors to hold an INF card, that is, {{be a member of}} their national organization, but some have relaxed this restriction, relying on the carrying of a trade card. <b>Holiday</b> <b>centers</b> can be quite small, just a couple of hectares or large occupying over 300 hectares. In a large holiday centre there will be swimming pools, sports pitches, an entertainment program, kids' clubs, restaurants and supermarkets. Some holiday centres allow regular visitors to purchase their own chalets, and generations of the same families will visit each year. Holiday centres are more tolerant of clothing than members-only clubs; total nudity is usually compulsory in the swimming pools and may be expected on the beaches, while on the football pitches, or in the restaurants in the evening, it is rare.|$|R
