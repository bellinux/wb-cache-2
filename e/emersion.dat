40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{investigate}} the periodicity of shell microgrowth lines and increments of cockles in the intertidal and subtidal areas. A total of 600 marked specimens of the blood cockle Anadara granosa were placed in buried cages that were placed at three sites of differing water levels (Site A: exposed in all low tides, Site B: exposed during spring tides, and Site C: continuously immersed) in Pinang Island, Malaysia. Cockles were collected on a fortnightly basis and the shells were sectioned from the umbo to the ventral margin, before being polished, etched and photographed under a light microscope to observe microgrowth lines and increments. The majority of the cockle shells examined showed {{that the number of}} growth lines in shell structures was close to the number of tidal <b>emersions</b> (P> 0. 01). The number of microgrowth lines observed in shells during the study period was significantly different (P< 0. 01) from the number of days and tidal changes. Similarly, cockles grown in the laboratory in a simulated tidal regime, deposited a number of microgrowth bands which coincided with the number of tidal <b>emersions.</b> This study shows that shell microgrowth lines are typically formed in accordance with tidal <b>emersions,</b> providing a calendar base for high resolution environmental reconstructions.

The data have been obtained using the methods of continuous logging and registration of certain behavioral manifestations. As the evaluation parameter of motor activity of seals the estimated ratio of <b>emersions</b> per minute has been selected. It {{has been shown that}} depending on the frequency of the generated magnetic fields and duration of exposure in this animal, the motor activity of the seal can both be oppressed and increased significantly. The influence of the magnetic field with the frequency of 2 Hz on grey seal for 1 – 4 hours causes an increase in motor activity of the animal during the period of its exposure; before and after the exposure to MP the number of acts of <b>emersions</b> has been much lower. The effect of MP with the frequency of 18 Hz depends on its duration on the animal: exposure for 1 – 2 hours causes an increase in motor activity of the seal as during the impact, and at its termination; more prolonged exposure (3 – 4 hours) causes a decrease in motor activity in the period of MP impact and a sharp increase in acts of <b>emersions</b> after the termination of MP generation. The influence of the magnetic field with the frequency of 36 Hz depends on the duration of its effects on the animal: the exposure over 1 hour causes a reduction in motor activity during the MP exposure and after the cessation of its effects; longer exposure (2 – 4 hours) causes a {{rise in the number of}} acts of <b>emersions</b> as during the MP generation and after termination of its impact on the animal. Experiments with the "imaginary effect" confirm the validity of the obtained data as during all four experiences some significant fluctuation of animal motor activity has been observed. ...|$|R

25|$|Because {{intertidal}} organisms endure regular {{periods of}} immersion and <b>emersion,</b> they essentially live both underwater and {{on land and}} must be adapted to a large range of climatic conditions. The intensity of climate stressors varies with relative tide height because organisms living in areas with higher tide heights are emersed for longer periods than those living in areas with lower tide heights.

These adaptations may be behavioral (i.e. movements or actions), morphological (i.e. characteristics of external body structure), or physiological (i.e. internal functions of cells and organs).

60|$|These eye-facets {{form the}} sense of light, rather than organs of seeing. Their almost {{paradoxical}} number at least, and the singularity of their forms, render it probable that they impel the animal by some modification of its irritability, herein likewise containing a striking analogy to the known influence of light on plants, than as excitements of sensibility. The sense that is nearest akin to irritability, and which alone resides in the muscular system, is that of touch, or feeling. This, therefore, is the first sense that emerges. Being confined to absolute contact, it occupies the lowest rank; but {{for that very reason}} it is the ground of all the other senses, which act, according to the ratio of their ascent, at still increasing distances, and become more and more ideal, from the tentacles of the polypus, to the human eye; which latter might be defined the outward organ of the identity, or at least of the indifference, of the real and ideal. But as the calcareous residuum of the lowest class approaches to the nature of horn in the snail, so the cumbrous shell of the snail has been transformed into polished and moveable plates of defensive armour in the insect. Thus, too, the same power of progressive individuation articulates the tentacula of the polypus and holothuria into antennæ; thereby manifesting the full <b>emersion</b> and eminency of irritability as a power which acts in, and gives its own character to, that of reproduction. The least observant must have noticed the lightning-like rapidity with which the insect tribes devour and eliminate their food, as by an instinctive necessity, and in the least degree {{for the purposes of the}} animal’s own growth or enlargement. The same predominance of irritability, and at the same time a new start in individuation, is shown in the reproductive power as generation. There is now a regular projection, ab intra ad extra, for which neither sprouts nor cuttings can any longer be the substitutes. We have not space for further detail; but there is one point too strikingly illustrative and even confirmative of the proposed system, to be omitted altogether. We mean the curious fact, that the same characteristic tendency, ad extra, which in the males and females of certain insect tribes is realized in the functions of generation, conception, and parturiency, manifests and expands itself in the sexless individuals (which are always in this case the great majority of the species), as instincts of art, and in the construction of works completely detached and inorganic; while the geometric regularity of these works, which bears an analogy to crystallization, is demonstrably no more than the necessary result of uniform action in a compressed multitude.|$|E

The discovery of early Aptian dinosaur footprints in the limestone of the carbonate platform of southern Italy gives new insights on dinosaur distribution, and new palaeontological constraints for the palaeogeographic reconstruction of the Mediterranean Tethys during the Cretaceous. The analysis of this and others ichnosites of the periadriatic carbonate platforms, gives evidence of repeated <b>emersions</b> and of widespread land-vertebrates dwelling.

The main role of the snout is to prevent oxygen atoms to access and damage the steel surface before entering into the zinc pot. Snout-end deformation is today the main reason of snout end-of-life. It generates air leaks, leading to defects generations as non-coated spots. ArcelorMittal R&D developed 3 D thermo-mechanical models of industrial snout-ends.

Boundary conditions were determined thanks to specific measurements at laboratory and on industrial plant. The model shows that the main origin of the snout deformation are the temperature gradients between immersed and non-immersed parts, and the dilatation generated during the snout immersion. The creeping effect appears to be negligible. During heating phase like during the cooling, strong compressive stresses appears in the snout walls leading to cracks occurrence and buckling of the snout walls. In all cases, the level and mode of deformation depend strongly on the snout design and fixation system of the snout lower part.

The results of this thesis suggest that MPB distribution on intertidal flat was controlled {{by a set of}} complex interaction between the MPB with both biotic and abiotic factors. How much MPB are there on the sediment surfaces determines the availability of MPB biomass after immersion period and in the water column during immersion. ‘Sum of sun hours’ and ‘sum of rainfall’ directly affected the MPB biomass on sediment surfaces, and consequently, indirectly affected the MPB that associated with suspended sediment in the water column during immersions. Tidal range did not have significant effect on MPB biomass on sediment surfaces, however was significantly negatively effected the suspended MPB on the mud flat and the transition zone. The Chl a on the salt marsh however was significantly positively correlated with the tidal range. Data of net settlement rate of suspended sediment per hour during immersions displayed positive relationship with MPB biomass availability after immersion.

Sequence 1 (units US 1 and US 2) remains unknown in its lower part because it does not outcrop. Its upper part comprises early Miocene shallow water carbonates. Sequence S 2 (Unit US 3) only comprises an upper Miocene transgressive systems tract deposited into basinal environment. It is bounded by major erosional surfaces SB 2 and SB 3. Sequence 3 (US 4 to US 6) is Zanclean to Pleistocene. It is dominantly composed of shallow water, reefal deposits. Sequence 4 corresponds to recent deposits. The Karukéra spur experienced three main extensional episodes with alternations between uplift and subsidence periods. Uplifts are responsible for <b>emersions</b> and erosions. Subsidence severely drowned shallow water deposits. The first extensional episode led to the formation of horsts and grabens in the basement, prior to early Miocene deposits. The second extensional episode occurred during upper Miocene, in accordance with data in surrounding islands. The third tectonic episode developed since Calabrian. Noticeable is the constant reactivation of N 130 °–N 150 °, N 150 °–N 180 ° and N 40 ° trending faults since early Miocene and the neoformation of E–W trending faults since Calabrian. Our results suggest that at the latitude of Guadeloupean archipelago the Lesser Antilles subduction zone is an erosional margin because of the successive sweepings of the Santa Lucia then Tiburon Ridges...|$|R
40|$|In the low Venetian plain (north-eastern Italy) thick {{sequences}} of silt and sand layers alternate with common and thin layers of peat and organic silt; the organic layers in the topmost 30 m of the Late Pleistocene alluvial series span between 23, 000 and 14, 000 yr BP (radiocarbon dating), in {{a stretch of}} plain about 100 km large and some 30 km deep. They indicate the presence of wide areas where wet environments developed. Our research aims at understanding the features and {{the origin of the}} wet environments by means of sedimentological analysis, pollen, non-pollen palynomorphs and plant macrofossil analyses. A series of medium-deep cores were drilled in the central zone of the low Venetian plain near the coast of the Adriatic Sea and 79 samples have been analysed. The palaeoenvironmental reconstruction based on previous pollen analysis did not underline the presence of the areas where peat layers were formed, suggesting a homogenous steppe environment, typical of a cold and dry climate. They were probably waterlogged for a great part of the year, to allow the formation of peat deposits, and the local plant communities had to consist mainly of aquatic species. The results of macrofossil and pollen analysis suggest that herbaceous plants, such as Cyperaceae and Gramineae (probably Carex fusca and Phragmites australis) and “brownmosses” (mainly Scorpidium scorpioides) were important components of marsh communities. The occurrence of obligate aquatic organisms (Nymphaea, Characeae, Briozoa and Potamogeton remains) and non-pollen palynomorphs as algal resting cells, free cells and colonies (Zygnemataceae, Spirogyra, Mougeotia, Closterium idiosporum, Type 225, Type 229, Type 417 B, Botryococcus, Pediastrum cf. boryanum, P. cf. simplex, Ceratium hirundinella, Tetraedron cf. minimum and Type 333), oocytes of aquatic invertebrates (Type 353 A and 353 B) and incompletely known types probably of algal origin (Type 303, Type 74, Type 128 A and 128 B) indicates open water environments. A discontinuous occurrence of fungal spores and remains (Type 200, Type 126, Type 207, Type 351, Type 79, and incompletely known types) suggests frequent fluctuations of the water depth and periodic <b>emersions</b> of the bottom of the ponds or marshes. The nutritive quality of the water preferred by the identified species, or suggested in literature for the recognized fossil types, is typical of mainly eutrophic to mesotrophic waters, rich in cations. Peat formed in wide and low-lying areas between the fluvial ridges, periodically inundated by the alternating outcropping of the groundwater table. Peat accumulation in continuous layers could take place only where the fen organic deposition prevailed on the alluvial minerogenic sedimentation. When the alluvial deposition overwhelmed the organic one, the peat level was buried and incorporated in the stratigraphic record...|$|R
40|$|Lower Jurassic Tethyan and Panthalassan {{shallow water}} {{successions}} {{are characterized by}} aberrant bivalves belonging to the Lithiotis Fauna (also named lithiotids). Their widespread occurrence, often in rock-forming abundance, represents a global event, mostly restricted to the Pliensbachian – early Toarcian. Despite their global distribution and abundance, their biogeographic and stratigraphic distribution, and their evolutionary history are obscure, mostly because the classification at lower taxonomical rank (generic or specific level) is frequently not available in the literature. In the Apennine Carbonate platform of southern Italy, the Lower Jurassic succession {{is represented by the}} Palaeodasycladus Limestone, overlain by the Oolitic-oncolitic Limestone. The former lithostratigraphical unit yields, in the upper part, the Orbitopsella Limestone and the Lithiotis Member. The latter, about one hundred metres thick, is characterized by the abundant occurrence of the lithiotid bivalves, which disappear in the lower beds of the Oolitic-oncolitic Limestones, {{at the onset of the}} early Toarcian anoxic event. The Lithiotis Member and the lower Oolitic-oncolitic Limestones are beautifully exposed in a quarry west of Mercato San Severino. Here, the Lithiotis Member consists mainly of meter-thick ― lithiotid biostromes, alternating with coarse peloidal-intraclastic grainstones and rudstones with abundant remains of Palaeodasycladus mediterraneus. Sometimes, the limestone beds are overlain by thin and discontinuous green marls. In the quarry succession more than 40 bivalve concentrations are present, the most part of which are represented by autochthonous monospecific to paucispecific assemblages, frequently with individuals preserved in life position. The taxonomic composition, biofabric and geometry of the accumulations have been examined. The bivalve assemblages are dominated, among the Lithiotis Fauna, by Mytiloperna, Cochlearites and Lithioperna. The occurrence of Lithiotis is not proved. Other bivalves are represented by megalodontids and Opisoma. The biogenic concentrations exhibit generally a tabular shape. Lens-shaped accumulations (bivalve mud-mounds) are rare and low, not thicker than one meter. The high abundance of the calcareous green alga Palaeodasycladus and of autochthonous shells of Mytiloperna, a marker of upper subtidal conditions, the tabular shape of the shell accumulations and the facies succession suggest a very shallow marine environment, with recurrent and prolonged <b>emersions</b> phases. This environmental setting is also supported by the absence of marine biota indicative of open platform /deep lagoon environments (e. g., brachiopods) and of infaunal bivalves (e. g. Pholadomya, Gresslya) typical of muddy substrates below the normal wave base. The frequent preservation of the sessile epi- semi-infaunal bivalves still in life position suggests high sedimentation rates favoured by the stick- and spoon-shaped shells of the Lithiotis Fauna, through the prolific production (fecal pellets) and efficient trapping of the carbonate sediments. The absence of thick bivalve-mounds, the occurrence of autochthonous biota of very shallow marine environment, the highly fossiliferous content in a relatively thin succession (about one hundred meters) suggest a carbonate platform with a low subsidence rate but with rapid sedimentation processes typical of the lithiotid habitat...|$|R
