40|$|ABSTRACT. Restoration {{efforts for}} <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> Salvelinus {{namaycush}} in Lake Michigan are increas-ingly being focused on re-establishment {{of the species}} in deep water. This focus is {{based in part on}} exam-ination of historical records of indigenous <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> which suggest that offshore reefs, especially deep reefs, sustained the <b>greatest</b> numbers of <b>lake</b> <b>trout.</b> This focus is also based on the increasing impact of non-indigenous species, such as alewife and round goby, on <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> survival on shallow reefs. Devel-opment of a successful strategy for re-establishing deep-water <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> in <b>Lake</b> Michigan will require {{a better understanding of the}} challenges to a species that evolved in shallow water and whose nearest rela-tives are shallow-water fishes. The challenges include an annual temperature cycle with fall warming rather than cooling, which may impact reproductive timing and embryo incubation. Deep water presents challenges to fry in that there is no apparent physiological mechanism for producing swim bladder gas and initial filling of the swim bladder at the surface has little impact on buoyancy once a fry returns to depth and the swim bladder is compressed. First feeding is a challenge because there is no local primary production to support a rich prey supply and the phenology of zooplankton prey abundance differs from that in small lakes. We propose that plans for restoration of <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> into deepwater habitats in Lake Michigan must proceed in concert with research leading to a better understanding of extant deepwate...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the concentrations of environmental contaminants in the edible portion of fish tissue consumed by Ojibwa residing in the Upper <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> region. <b>Lake</b> <b>trout,</b> whitefish, and walleye were collected from Lake Superior, Lake Huron, Lake Michigan, and selected inland lakes. These fish were harvested by either commercial fishing or spearfishing techniques and analyzed for environmental contaminants. Samples were pooled by species and location of collection and were analyzed as composites. The concentrations of congener-specific polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB), total mercury, and 17 other organochlorine compounds of the pooled samples were determined using gas chromatographic and atomic absorption techniques. Differences were noted in both the concentration and composition of contaminants depending on the geographic location of collection and the species examined. <b>Lake</b> <b>trout</b> and whitefish contained higher concentrations of organochlorine compounds than did walleye; and samples from Lakes Michigan and Huron had much higher concentrations than did Lake Superior fish. Conversely, mercury was much higher in walleye (580 ppb) when compared with <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> (117 ppb) and whitefish (10 ppb). Several PCB congeners were commonly found in all fish samples; these included PCBs 138 + 163, 153, 66 + 95, 118, 77 + 110, 180, and 101. <b>Lake</b> <b>trout</b> accumulated the highly chlorinated PCB congeners, whereas walleye and whitefish accumulated certain lower tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyl congeners.

Consequently, it is imperative to sample fish that best represent those being consumed by tribal members and to continue long-term monitoring of fish from ceded waters. Therefore, risk assessment and risk management strategies need to take into account geographic location of the fish and unique preparation methods and to be directed at the contaminant(s) of concern for given locations...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Understanding {{fishing fleet}} {{dynamics}} is important when using fishery dependent data to infer {{the status of}} fish stocks. We analyzed data from mandatory catch reports from the commercial <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> (Salvelinus namaycush) fishery in Michigan waters of Lake Superior during 1929 – 1961, a period when <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> populations collapsed through the combined effects of overfishing and sea lamprey (Petromyzon marinus) predation. The number of full-time fishermen increased during 1933 – 1943 and then decreased during 1943 – 1957. Addition of new fishermen was related to past yield, market prices, World War II draft exemptions, and lost fishing opportunities in Lake Huron and Lake Michigan. Loss of existing fishermen was related to declining <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> density. Large mesh (≥ 114 -mm stretch-measure) gill net effort increased during 1929 – 1951 because fishermen fished more net inshore as <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> den-sity declined, even though catch per effort (CPE) was often higher in deeper waters. The most common gill net mesh size increased from 114 -mm to 120 -mm stretch-measure during 1929 – 1957, as <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> growth increased. More effort was fished inshore than offshore {{and the amount of}} inshore effort was less variable over time than offshore effort. Relatively stable yield was maintained by increasing gill net effort and by moving some effort to better grounds.

40|$|To {{the best}} of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal {{employees}} when contributing to this work.

50|$|Like {{all of the}} <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes,</b> {{the ecology}} of Lake Huron has {{undergone}} drastic changes in the last century. The lake originally supported a native deepwater fish community dominated by <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> which fed {{on a number of}} deepwater ciscos as well as sculpins and other native fishes. Several invasive species, including sea lamprey, alewife and rainbow smelt, became abundant in the lake by the 1930s. The major native top predator, <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> were virtually extirpated from the lake by 1950 due to a combination of overfishing and the effects of sea lamprey. Several species of deepwater ciscos were also extirpated from the lake by the 1960s; the only remaining native deepwater cisco is the bloater. Nonnative Pacific salmon have been stocked in the lake since the 1960s, and <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> have also been stocked in an attempt to rehabilitate the species, although little natural reproduction of stocked trout has been observed.|$|R
50|$|Three {{subspecies}} of <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> are accepted.

Some lakes do not have pelagic forage fish {{during the period of}} summer stratification. In these <b>lakes,</b> <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> take on a life history known as planktivory. <b>Lake</b> <b>trout</b> in planktivorous populations are highly abundant, grow very slowly and mature at relatively small sizes.

40|$|Recruitment {{failure of}} <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> (Salvelinus namaycush) in the <b>Great</b> <b>Lakes</b> has been {{attributed}} {{in part to}} the consumption of alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus) by adult <b>lake</b> <b>trout,</b> leading to Thiamine Deficiency Complex (TDC) and early mortality in fry. The current understanding of thiamine deficiency in <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> fry is based on information from culture and hatchery settings, which do not represent conditions fry experience in the wild and may influence the occurrence of TDC. In the wild, <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> fry have access to zooplankton immediately following hatching; previous studies found that wild fry begin feeding before complete yolk-sac absorption. However, hatchery-raised fry are not provided with food until after yolk-sac absorption, long after the development of TDC. Zooplankton are a potential source of dietary thiamine for wild fry in the early life stages that has not previously been considered in the occurrence of thiamine deficiency. We postulated that wild-hatched fry could mitigate thiamine deficiency through early feeding on natural prey. Specifically, we hypothesized 1) feeding should increase thiamine concentrations relative to unfed fry and 2) feeding should increase survival relative to unfed fry. Feeding experiments were conducted on <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> fry reared from eggs collected from Lake Champlain in 2014 and Cayuga Lake in 2015. A fully crossed experimental design was used to determine the effect of early feeding by <b>lake</b> <b>trout</b> fry in thiamine replete and thiamine deplete treatments before and after feeding.
