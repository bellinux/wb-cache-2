25|$|To produce Higgs bosons, two {{beams of}} {{particles}} are accelerated to very high energies {{and allowed to}} collide within a particle detector. Occasionally, although rarely, a <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson</b> will be created fleetingly {{as part of the}} collision byproducts. Because the <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson</b> decays very quickly, particle detectors cannot detect it directly. Instead the detectors register all the decay products (the decay signature) and from the data the decay process is reconstructed. If the observed decay products match a possible decay process (known as a decay channel) of a <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson,</b> this indicates that a <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson</b> may have been created. In practice, many processes may produce similar decay signatures. Fortunately, the Standard Model precisely predicts the likelihood of each of these, and each known process, occurring. So, if the detector detects more decay signatures consistently matching a <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson</b> than would otherwise be expected if Higgs bosons did not exist, then this would be strong evidence that the <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson</b> exists.|$|E

25|$|Following the 2012 discovery, it {{was still}} {{unconfirmed}} {{whether or not the}} 125 GeV/c2 particle was a <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson.</b> On one hand, observations remained consistent with the observed particle being the Standard Model <b>Higgs</b> <b>boson,</b> and the particle decayed into {{at least some of the}} predicted channels.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the final {{interpretation of the}} results from DELPHI on the searches for <b>Higgs</b> <b>bosons</b> in the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM). A few representative scenarios are considered, that include CP conservation and explicit CP violation in the Higgs sector. The experimental results encompass the searches for neutral <b>Higgs</b> <b>bosons</b> at LEP 1 and LEP 2 in final states as expected in the MSSM, as well as LEP 2 searches for charged <b>Higgs</b> <b>bosons</b> and for neutral <b>Higgs</b> <b>bosons</b> decaying into hadrons independent of the quark flavour. The data reveal no significant excess with respect to background expectations. The results are translated into excluded regions of the parameter space in the various scenarios. In the CP-conserving case, these lead to limits on the masses of the lightest scalar and pseudoscalar <b>Higgs</b> <b>bosons,</b> h and A, and on tan beta. The dependence of these limits on the top quark mass is discussed. Allowing for CP violation reduces the experimental sensitivity to <b>Higgs</b> <b>bosons.</b> It is shown that this effect depends strongly on {{the values of the}} parameters responsible for CP violation in the Higgs sector...|$|R
