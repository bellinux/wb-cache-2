30|$|This is {{followed}} by a chain of cadences, which drives the key from <b>G</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor,</b> a tritone relationship to tonic, with E flat acting as a flat six, an enharmonically augmented fifth again acting as a six chord, which then resolves to G major and returns to tonic. There are four measures, which are driven by plagal cadences, which end with authentic cadences. All sequential material is varied to avoid repetition. These serve a dual purpose, they appear to be chord clusters and exude all the color of them, yet we feel the underlying driving force of cadential resolution.|$|E
30|$|In section A, {{measures}} 1 – 8, {{the key is}} C major, his favorite. However, {{his first}} order of business is to alter tonic up a half step to throw the listener off balance, and he uses a cadential succession in distant harmonic relationships. The harmony is chromatic and not always functional. There are non-diatonic tones used for color. The key relationships are not always certain, although the chords appear to flirt with D major and <b>G</b> <b>flat</b> <b>minor.</b> This is a tritone relationship, functioning like an unusually constructed six chord resolving to the dominant with the dominant returning to tonic at phrase end. This is another favorite in Prokofiev’s bag of tricks, which serves to raise the tonic, which acts as a leading tone pointing toward an implied D major, which in turn acts as the subdominant of the key of G major, resolving there, and then resolving further to C major.|$|E
50|$|Singer David Gilmour often {{approaches}} the C minor chord by singing on the diminished fifth, <b>G</b> <b>flat,</b> before descending to the fourth, minor third, and root. This melody is also {{compatible with the}} next chord, E <b>flat</b> <b>minor,</b> in which <b>G</b> <b>flat</b> is the <b>minor</b> third. It also appears in the A flat seventh chord, as the dominant seventh.|$|R

5000|$|... 4. [...] "The Hero at Battle": In {{this first}} {{extended}} development {{section of the}} work, percussion and a solo trumpet are heard in the first appearance of 3/4 time: a variation of a previous motive. A sequence of clamorous trumpet fanfares occurs as the music approaches a harmonic climax in <b>G</b> <b>flat,</b> and the related E <b>flat</b> <b>minor.</b> Percussion is pervasive throughout the movement. 4/4 time returns in a modified recapitulation of the first theme as it appeared {{at the beginning of}} the piece, this time with a repeated quaver accompaniment. A new cantabile theme makes its appearance in the trumpet, and an extended elaboration of this serves to preface the next section.|$|R
