50|$|The common <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices</b> (HIDs) {{available}} for desktop computers, laptops and similar devices determine {{the design of}} the (graphical) human-computer interface implemented in software. There are a few software packages to choose among, when building an accordingly designed graphical user interface. The generic input driver for the Linux kernel is evdev, but here are several input methods implemented as middleware, i.e., atop and not as part of the Linux kernel.|$|R
40|$|Many novel {{instruments}} {{have been}} built in recent decades, but they rarely become popular or even get played at any degree of virtuosity. A new model of instrument design is emerging, where creators make instruments tailored to a performer or specific piece, making instruments even more specific. Modular software for synthesis and mapping along with standard <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices</b> make this increasingly feasible. In addition, the performer’s body of technique could be modular as well, with musicians learning interfaces, mappings, and synthesizers as distinct ”modules ” of technique. This would allow musicians to play newly created instruments {{with some degree of}} existing skill. These modules of technique could exist separately from whole instruments, therefore allowing a shared body of technique to be developed, especially around software synthesizers, popular <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices,</b> and the mappings between them. The design of software used for such instrument building {{can go a long way}} to furthering this approach. Some specific software design ideas are explored in the context of Pd with the aim of fostering the discussion and development of modular technique. 1...|$|R

50|$|Gamepads {{typically}} require device drivers if used {{on contemporary}} personal computers. The device may {{be treated as}} its own class of <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>device,</b> or by use of a program known as a gamepad translator (or gamepad mapper) translated to key strokes or mouse actions. An example gamepad translator for Microsoft Windows is Xpadder, or antimicro which is free and open-source and cross-platform.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "HID" [...] most {{commonly}} {{refers to the}} USB-HID specification. The term was coined by Mike Van Flandern of Microsoft when he proposed that the USB committee create a Human Input Device class working group. The working group was renamed as the <b>Human</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Device</b> class {{at the suggestion of}} Tom Schmidt of DEC because the proposed standard supported bi-directional communication.|$|E
50|$|The field {{evolved into}} {{physical}} computing {{and it was}} followed by the creation of a number of other generic platforms for applying sensor technology in the (performing) arts such as Arduino, as well as the development of very application specific sensors for <b>human</b> <b>interfacing</b> and <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices.</b> While the focus of I-CubeX technology was initially on translating sensor signals to MIDI (Digitizer, microDig) for music enthusiasts, the transmission protocols now include Bluetooth (Wi-microDig) and USB (USB-microDig) so as to facilitate its use by all kinds of researchers and engineers, as well as MIDI.|$|R
50|$|One of the {{benefits}} of a well-defined specification like the USB HID class is the abundance of device drivers available in most modern operating systems. The USB HID class devices and their basic functions are defined in USB-IF documentation without any specific software in mind. Because of these generic descriptions, it is easy for operating system designers to include functioning drivers for devices such as keyboards, mice, and other generic <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices.</b> The inclusion of these generic drivers allows for faster deployment of devices and easier installation by end-users.|$|R
50|$|The latest Windows 10 release {{supports}} Miracast receiving {{along with}} UIBC support {{to allow for}} <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices</b> (touch screens, mouse, keyboard) to also have wireless connectivity. Windows 8.1 supports broadcasting/sending the screen via Miracast. Miracast is also built into Windows Phone 8.1. Developers can also implement Miracast {{on top of the}} built-in Wi-Fi Direct support in Windows 7 and Windows 8. Another way to support Miracast in Windows is with Intel's proprietary WiDi (v3.5 or higher). A software-based Miracast receiver for Windows 8.1, AirServer Universal, was made available on 31 October 2014 by App Dynamic.|$|R
50|$|The USB <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>device</b> {{class can}} be used to {{describe}} both device and interface classes. The interface class is used when a USB device can contain more than one function. It is possible, therefore, to have USB devices with two different interfaces at the same time (for example, a USB telephone may use a keypad covered by the HID class and a speaker covered by the USB communications device class).|$|E
50|$|Verizon started {{offering}} the SCH-I800 Galaxy Tab on 11 November 2010. Verizon's {{version of the}} Galaxy Tab has a textured black back, {{as opposed to the}} standard plastic rear of the T-Mobile, Sprint, and AT&T versions. The Verizon and Sprint versions disable the <b>Human</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Device</b> (HID) bluetooth features so it will not work with bluetooth keyboards, mice, etc. However, updates did correct this issue for both carriers.|$|E

5000|$|A working {{committee}} {{with representatives from}} several prominent companies developed the HID standard. The list of participants appears in the [...] "Device Class Definition for <b>Human</b> <b>Interface</b> <b>Devices</b> (HID)"document. The concept of a self-describing extensible protocol initially came from Mike Van Flandern and Manolito Adan while working on a project named [...] "Raptor" [...] at Microsoft, and independently from Steve McGowan, who worked on a device protocol for Access Bus while at Forte. After comparing notes at a Consumer Game Developer Conference, Steve and Mike agreed to collaborate on a new standard for the emerging Universal Serial Bus (USB).|$|R
50|$|Hands-free {{computing}} is any computer configuration where a {{user can}} interface {{without the use}} of their hands, an otherwise common requirement of <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices</b> such as the mouse and keyboard. Hands-free computing is important because it is useful to both able and disabled users. Speech recognition systems can be trained to recognize specific commands and upon confirmation of correctness instructions can be given to systems {{without the use of}} hands. This may be useful while driving or to an inspector or engineer in a factory environment. Likewise disabled persons may find hands-free computing important in their everyday lives. Just like visually impaired have found computers useful in their lives.|$|R
40|$|Computer music {{performance}} environments {{have evolved}} greatly in recent years, allowing complex control and inter-action with sound in real time. But the interaction has too frequently been {{tied to the}} keyboard-mouse-monitor model, narrowly constraining the range of possible gestures the per-former can use. The range of <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> <b>devices</b> has also greatly increased, making it much easier for the com-puter musician to capture {{a broader range of}} gestures. Pd provides an ideal platform for this work, combining sound and visual synthesis and control with easy access to many external <b>devices</b> for <b>interfacing</b> with <b>humans.</b> Pd is a high level programming language, making it usable by people of varying technical skill.
