40|$|AbstractThe {{possible}} {{clinical use}} of the methyl xanthine derivative, pentoxifylline (PF), {{for the treatment of}} T cell–dependent diseases is being noted with increasing interest. In this paper, we studied the molecular consequences of PF treatment during lymphocyte activation. We found that in T cells, anti-CD 3 -induced c-Rel expression was blocked <b>by</b> <b>PF,</b> whereas the induction of other NF-κB family members was not significantly affected. However, induction of NF-AT, which has the same signaling requirements as c-Rel induction, was not inhibited <b>by</b> <b>PF.</b> Among genes that respond to these transcription factors, IL- 2 mRNA induction was suppressed <b>by</b> <b>PF,</b> whereas IL- 2 Rα chain mRNA induction was not affected. These observations implicated c-Rel as an IL- 2 promoter factor, for which experimental support was obtained from transient transfection experiments. In contrast with the observation in T cells, c-Rel induction was not blocked <b>by</b> <b>PF</b> in B cells. The greater selectivity of PF, compared with FK 506, at both the molecular and cellular levels may prove advantageous in manipulating T cell responses in vivo...|$|R

40|$|Pseudomonas fluorescens strain SS 101 (Pf. SS 101) {{promotes}} {{growth of}} Arabidopsis thaliana, enhances greening and lateral root formation, and induces systemic resistance (ISR) against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst). Here, targeted and untargeted approaches were adopted to identify bacterial determinants and underlying mechanisms involved in plant growth promotion and ISR <b>by</b> <b>Pf.</b> SS 101. Based on targeted analyses, no evidence {{was found for}} volatiles, lipopeptides and siderophores in plant growth promotion <b>by</b> <b>Pf.</b> SS 101. Untargeted, genome-wide analyses of 7, 488 random transposon mutants of Pf. SS 101 led to the identification of 21 mutants defective in both plant growth promotion and ISR. Many of these mutants, however, were auxotrophic and impaired in root colonization. Genetic analysis of three mutants followed by site-directed mutagenesis, genetic complementation and plant bioassays revealed {{the involvement of the}} phosphogluconate dehydratase gene edd, the response regulator gene colR and the adenylsulfate reductase gene cysH in both plant growth promotion and ISR. Subsequent comparative plant transcriptomics analyses strongly suggest that modulation of sulfur assimilation, auxin biosynthesis and transport, steroid biosynthesis and carbohydrate metabolism in Arabidopsis are key mechanisms linked to growth promotion and ISR <b>by</b> <b>Pf.</b> SS 101.

40|$|The {{effect of}} peritoneal fluid (PF) {{on the human}} sperm {{acrosome}} reaction (AR) was tested. Sperm was pre-incubated with PF and the AR was induced by calcium ionophore A 23187 and a neoglycoprotein bearing N-acetylglycosamine residues (NGP). The AR induced by calcium ionophore was inhibited 40 % <b>by</b> <b>PF</b> from controls (PFc) and 50 % <b>by</b> <b>PF</b> from the endometriosis (PFe) group, but not <b>by</b> <b>PF</b> from infertile patients without endometriosis (PFi). No {{significant differences were found}} in the spontaneous AR. When the AR was induced by NGP, pre-incubation with PFc reduced (60 %) the percentage of AR, while PFe and PFi caused no significant differences. The average rates of acrosome reactions obtained in control, NGP- and ionophore-treated sperm showed that NGP-induced exocytosis differed significantly between the PFc (11 %) and PFe/PFi groups (17 %), and the ionophore-induced AR was higher for PFi (33 %) than PFc/PFe (25 %). The incidence of the NGP-induced AR was reduced in the first hour of pre-incubation with PFc and remained nearly constant throughout 4 h of incubation. The present data indicate that PF possesses a protective factor which prevents premature AR. Hospital de Clínicas de Porto AlegreUniversidade Federal de São Paulo (UNIFESP) UNIFESPSciEL...|$|R

40|$|Organized synapse {{formation}} on to Purkinje cell (PC) dendrites <b>by</b> parallel fibers (<b>PFs)</b> {{and climbing}} fibers (CFs) {{is crucial for}} cerebellar function. In PCs lacking glutamate receptor delta 2 (GluRdelta 2), PF synapses are reduced in number, numerous free spines emerge, and multiple CF innervation persists to adulthood. In the present study, we conducted anterograde and immunohistochemical labelings to investigate how CFs innervate PC dendrites under weakened synaptogenesis <b>by</b> <b>PFs.</b> In the GluRdelta 2 knock-out mouse, CFs were distributed in the molecular layer more closely to the pial surface compared with the wild-type mouse. Serial electron microscopy demonstrated that CFs in the knock-out mouse innervated all spines protruding from proximal dendrites of PCs, as did those in the wild-type mouse. In the knock-out mouse, however, CF innervation extended distally to spiny branchlets, where {{nearly half of the}} spines were free of innervation in contrast to complete synapse formation <b>by</b> <b>PFs</b> in the wild-type mouse. Furthermore, from the end point of innervation, CFs aberrantly jumped to form ectopic synapses on adjacent spiny branchlets, whose proximal portions were often innervated by different CFs. Without GluRdelta 2, CFs are thus able to expand their territory along and beyond dendritic trees of the target PC, resulting in persistent surplus CFs by innervating the distal dendritic segment. We conclude that GluRdelta 2 is essential to restrict CF innervation to the proximal dendritic segment, by which territorized innervation <b>by</b> <b>PFs</b> and CFs is properly structured and the formation of excess CF wiring to adjacent PCs is suppressed...|$|R
