60|$|We must guard {{ourselves}} against looking upon vicious instincts as perversions, {{inasmuch as}} they may be strictly in accordance with the healthy nature of the man, and, being transmissible by inheritance, may become the normal characteristics of a healthy race, just as the sheep-dog, the retriever, the pointer, and the bull-dog, have their several instincts. There can be no greater popular error than the supposition that natural instinct is a perfectly trustworthy guide, for there are striking contradictions to such an opinion in individuals of every <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal.</b> The most that we are entitled to say in any case is, that the prevalent instincts of each race are trustworthy, not those of every individual. But even this is saying too much, because when the conditions under which the race is living have recently been changed, some instincts which were adapted to the old state of things are sure to be fallacious guides to conduct in the new one. A man who is counted as an atrocious criminal in England, and is punished as such by English law in social self-defence, may nevertheless have acted in strict accordance with instincts that are laudable in less civilised societies. The ideal criminal is, unhappily for him, deficient in qualities that are capable of restraining his unkindly or inconvenient instincts; he has neither sympathy for others nor the sense of duty, both of which lie at the base of conscience; nor has he sufficient self-control to accommodate himself to the society in which he has to live, and so to promote his own selfish interests in the long-run. He cannot be preserved from criminal misadventure, either by altruistic sentiments or by intelligently egoistic ones.|$|E

5000|$|The song [...] "Great Green Gobs of Greasy, Grimy Gopher Guts" [...] is a children's {{public domain}} {{playground}} song popular throughout the United States. Dating back {{to at least}} the mid-20th century, the song is sung {{to the tune of}} [...] "The Old Gray Mare". The song, especially popular in school lunchrooms and at summer camps, presents macabre horrors through cheerful comedy while allowing children to explore taboo images and words especially as they relate to standards of cleanliness and dining. Many local and regional variations of the lyrics exist, but whatever variant, they always entail extensive use of the literary phonetic device known as an alliteration which helps to provide an amusing <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> body parts and fluids not normally consumed by Americans.|$|E
5000|$|Examples of the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> tissues as [...] "felted" [...] include {{classes of}} {{connective}} tissue {{such as the}} dermis which the classic Gray's Anatomy describes as: [...] "felted connective tissue, with a varying amount of elastic fibers and numerous bloodvessels, lymphatics, and nerves." [...] Also, in describing the external coat or tunica adventitia of an artery, Gray says: [...] "...consists mainly of fine and closely felted bundles of white connective tissue..." [...] In such classes of connective tissue the felted structure is very important; it is versatile in resisting tearing by distributing localised stresses and it imparts strength together with shock absorption and elasticity {{in two or three}} dimensions at once, irrespective of the shape of the tissue. In other words, suitable types of felting can yield controllable isotropy or anisotropy in the behaviour of a structure.|$|E

The animals were tracheotomised, intubated and mechanically ventilated (Galileo Gold; Hamilton Medical, Switzerland). Arterial, venous and urinary catheters were placed. The pressure at the airway opening and airflow were monitored continuously (Florian respiratory monitor; Acutronic Medical Systems, Zug, Switzerland) and arterial partial pressures of oxygen (PaO 2) and carbon dioxide (PaCO 2) recorded (Paratrend 7; Diametrics Medical, High Wycombe, UK).

40|$|Morgan’s Canon is a {{specific}} restating of Occam’s Razor that dictates that any <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> behavior should never call upon higher order psychological processes if the behaviour could, fairly, be {{explained in terms of}} lower processes. Herein, the Canon is discussed both historically and in light of current research into animal behavior. A reconsideration of the principle of parsimony, taking into account current states of knowledge, is also considered. In short, it is argued that Morgan’s Canon, while a useful guideline, may have been over enthusiastically applied in situations where the state of knowledge about a species would dictate that descriptions of its behavior in terms of higher order processes would be equally or more parsimonious. The potential benefits of reconsidering the Canon are then discussed. Matthew Brian Wels...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} method for the {{learning}} of Sensory-Motor Coordination (SMC) through the teleoperation of a humanoid robot designed for human-robot interaction. It is argued that SMC in a complex environment must be learned rather than programmed. Schema theory is reviewed {{as a tool for}} the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> behavior at the level of functional modules and higher. SMC is shown to be necessary for the formation of schema assemblages for the control of behavior. Examples are given of four behavior-based robot control architectures that implicitly use SMC-driven schema control. It is shown that while the robots are capable of learning, they all rely, to a certain extent, on ad hoc choices of SMC by the designers. A description of the humanoid robot and the sensors it uses for reaching and grasping is given. The proposed method of learning via teleoperation is described. Sensory data acquired through grasping is presented...|$|E

It is concluded {{that it is important to}} move away from an approach based on advocacy and towards objective assessment of all available data. Existing diagnoses should be viewed as hypothetical constructs, with the underlying hypotheses being identified and subject to investigation. It is emphasized that global communication, empirical investigations and critical review are necessary for the development of a solid scientific basis within veterinary behavioural medicine...|$|E

30|$|The fat {{used for}} heating {{purposes}} has been analysed at the University of Budapest by Lezsovits and Könczöl [10] who researched {{the use of}} animal fats in industrial steam generators that conventionally ran on diesel or natural gas. The use of this by-product was intended not only to remove it as a waste product but also to provide an alternative non-fossil fuel. In Germany, F. Pfab [11] treated animal fat from processing plants and subsequently used it in combustion to generate steam in a tubular boiler. Before feeding the fat into the burner, the burner must be cleaned with a decanter and separator. Our study breaks new ground in current technology by performing combustion of animal fat at an injection pressure below 10 bars, compared to conventional 30 bar pressure. In Spain, Dr. J. San José [12] has conducted {{a number of studies}} of the combustion of lard in a commercial burner and into the miscibility of lard in diesel. These studies posit an important field of study in the <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> fats and their use as fuels in conventional diesel facilities.|$|E
40|$|A {{quantitative}} <b>description</b> <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> {{social behaviour}} is informative for behavioural biologists and clinicians developing drugs to treat social disorders. Social interaction {{in a group}} of animals has been difficult to measure because behaviour develops {{over long periods of time}} and requires tedious manual scoring, which is subjective and often non-reproducible. Computer-vision systems with the ability to measure complex social behaviour automatically would have a transformative impact on biology. Here, we present a method for tracking group-housed mice individually as they freely interact over multiple days. Each mouse is bleach-marked with a unique fur pattern. The patterns are automatically learned by the tracking software and used to infer identities. Trajectories are analysed to measure behaviour as it develops over days, beyond the range of acute experiments. We demonstrate how our system may be used to study the development of place preferences, associations and social relationships by tracking four mice continuously for five days. Our system enables accurate and reproducible characterisation of wild-type mouse social behaviour and paves the way for high-throughput long-term observation of the effects of genetic, pharmacological and environmental manipulations...|$|E
