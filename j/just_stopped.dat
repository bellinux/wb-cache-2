The Ring did not {{recognize}} this bout for its vacant Welterweight Championship despite the fact it pitted The Ring #1 ranked welterweight, Antonio Margarito, vs. The Ring #3 ranked welterweight, Shane Mosley. Coming in the bout, Margarito had <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> the previous The Ring #1 ranked welterweight and current The Ring #2 ranked welterweight, Miguel Cotto. In the fight, Margarito was battered and outclassed by Mosley and lost the fight and his WBA title by 9th-round technical knockout.|$|E
25|$|Michael Lumb with 89 and Ian Harvey with 74 lifted Yorkshire to 270 all out at Headingley in {{the fourth}} quarter-final of the C Trophy. It {{was a bit of}} an {{implosion}} from 227 for 3, but runs came thick and fast in that period, so Yorkshire wouldn't be too disappointed with losing their wickets. Northamptonshire started well, getting to 163 for 2 after all their top four got starts, but two wickets from England Test bowler Matthew Hoggard started to turn the match. From then on, the Northamptonshire effort <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> dead, as they lost five wickets for 24 runs to fall to 216 for 9. Steffan Jones and Jason Brown paired up for 21 for the last wicket, but it was too little, too late.|$|E

500|$|While {{attending}} Central St Martins College, Arulpragasam {{wanted to}} make films and art depicting realism that would be accessible to everyone, something that she felt was missing from her classmates' ethics and the course criteria. At college, she found the fashion courses [...] "disposable" [...] and more current than the film texts that she studied. Maya told Arthur magazine [...] " [...] exploring apathy, dressing up in some pigeon outfit, or running around conceptualising... It missed {{the whole point of}} art representing society. Social reality didn’t really exist there; it <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> at theory." [...] She cited [...] "radical cinema" [...] including Harmony Korine, Dogme 95 and Spike Jonze as some of her cinematic inspirations during film school. As a student, she was approached by director John Singleton to work on a film in Los Angeles after he had read a script she had written, though she decided not to take up the offer. For her degree, M.I.A. prepared her departmental honours thesis on the film CB4.|$|E
500|$|Cotto's second title defense {{took place}} on February 26, 2005 in the Rubén Rodríguez in Bayamón, Puerto Rico against Demarcus Corley. During the fight Cotto practiced a boxing style that was more {{aggressive}} than usual, trading hits with Corley {{over the course of}} the first round. During the fight both boxers were deducted one point following illegal low blows. Cotto scored three knockdowns before the fight was stopped by the referee at 2:45 of the fifth round following a combination by Miguel. Corley claimed that the referee stopped the fight prematurely stating that [...] "the ref <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> the fight premature. If he wanted to stop the fight, he could have stopped it when I had [...] hurt." [...] Just a few days after retaining the crown versus Corley, Cotto received a personal blow, when his stablemate and friend, former 2004 Olympian Joseph Serrano, was shot in the head upon leaving the Bairoa gym. Serrano survived the shot, but was in critical but stable condition at a local hospital.|$|E

500|$|Reportedly, two {{separate}} albums of new music were recorded by Shields {{in his home}} studio, but were abandoned. According to sources, one was possibly influenced by jungle music. Shields later confirmed {{that at least one}} full album of new material was abandoned. He said, [...] "We did an album's worth of half-finished stuff, and it did just get dumped, but it was worth dumping. It was dead. It hadn't got that spirit, that life in it." [...] He later explained, [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> making records myself, and I suppose that must just seem weird to people. 'Why'd you do that?' The answer is, it wasn't as good [...] And I always promised myself I'd never do that, put out a worse record." [...] Shields later said to Magnet magazine, [...] "We are 100 per cent going to make another My Bloody Valentine record unless we die or something", and attributed the band's sparse output to a lack of inspiration. A third My Bloody Valentine album, MBV, was finally released in 2013, 22 years after Loveless.|$|E
500|$|Martin {{appeared}} in victory lane {{to celebrate his}} fifth win of the season, and his first at the New Hampshire Motor Speedway, in front of 101,000 who attended the race. Martin also earned $232,750 in race winnings. Montoya was somewhat frustrated with the result, saying: [...] "Martin just screwed me -- he <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> {{the car on the}} apex, right on the bottom, and I had nowhere to go," [...] Montoya said. [...] "I could have pushed him out of the way ... but I respect him a lot." [...] Martin was delighted with his victory: [...] "Alan [...] won the race, Alan's the man. This is a dream come true. ...

I mean, how stupid would I look then?" ...|$|E
500|$|On 3 March 1942, Flight Lieutenant Winckel was {{transporting}} {{refugees from}} the Bandung, Dutch East Indies, to Perth, Western Australia, in his Lockheed Lodestar. He had <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> on the Broome Airfield to refuel when Broome was attacked by nine Japanese Zero fighter planes on a long-distance raid from Kupang, Timor. Winckel saw the danger of his plane being on the open airstrip and proceeded to dismount the Colt 7.99mm machine gun from the plane. When one of the Zeros, piloted by Osamu Kudō, flew over at low altitude, Winckel managed to shoot {{him out of the}} air; the crash killed Kudō. Winckel was thereby credited with the raid's only [...] "kill" [...] on the Allied side. He also believed that he hit another Japanese plane that had to ditch in the sea. The Japanese destroyed 22 allied aircraft at Broome, many of them flying boats used for refugee transport and moored in Roebuck Bay. Winckel suffered severe burns to his hand during the attack, as he had to hold the machine-gun barrel to aim. His hand was treated and Winckel flew medical evacuations for the next two days without rest.|$|E

2500|$|The Germany {{national}} {{team that won}} the 2014 World Cup had deep Cruyffian (via Pep Guardiola) influences. After leaving Barcelona, Guardiola implanted the Cruyffian vision at Bayern Munich. Germany and Bayern goalkeeper Manuel Neuer, who completed more passes at the 2014 World Cup than Argentina's Lionel Messi did, incarnates the goalkeeper whom Cruyff dreamt up in the 1960s and 1970s: A footballer in gloves. It had always bothered Cruyff that goalkeepers <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> shots. He {{thought it was a}} waste of a player. As Cruyff once said, [...] "In my teams, the goalie (goalkeeper) is the first attacker and the striker the first defender." [...] He wanted a goalkeeper who could also get involved in the passing. Thus, the goalkeeper effectively becomes the 11th player, like Edwin van der Sar at Ajax or Víctor Valdés at Barcelona.|$|E

2500|$|Monte Canfield and Blair Meeks {{state that}} after the Protestant Reformation, Anglicans and Lutherans kept the rite of blessing and distributing ashes to the {{faithful}} on Ash Wednesday, and that the Protestant denominations that did not keep it encouraged its use [...] "during and after the ecumenical era {{that resulted in the}} Vatican II proclamations". Jack Kingsbury and Russell F. Anderson likewise state that the practice was continued among some Anglicans and Lutherans. On the other hand, Edward Traill Horn wrote: [...] "The ceremony of the distribution of the ashes was not retained by the reformers, whether Lutheran, Anglican or Reformed", although these denominations honored Ash Wednesday as the first day of Lent. Frank Senn, a liturgical scholar, has been quoted as saying: [...] "How and why the use of ashes fell out of Lutheran use is difficult to discern from the sources… hurch orders don't specifically say not to use ashes; they simply stopped giving direction for blessing and distributing them and eventually the pastors <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mr. Bungle emerged {{after its}} members were kicked out their {{respective}} bands. [...] "It was kinda like a merger between two bands," [...] Mike Patton recalled. [...] "One really horrible gothic metal band, which our guitarist and original drummer were in, and one really horrible metal band which did Metallica covers, {{which is the}} one Trevor and me came from." [...] Mr. Bungle initially described themselves as a death metal band, but also dabbled in speed metal, thrash metal, and hardcore punk. And {{within a year of}} formation, the band expanded their sound to include ska. Trevor Dunn noted that, [...] "After about a year we got tired of playing speed metal and wanted to do something a little more creative. So we <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> and started writing our own style of music, which was influenced by bands like Camper Van Beethoven, Oingo Boingo, Bad Manners and kind of ska funk-ish oriented stuff. Then we added a two-piece horn section and a new drummer, so now we don't really have any kind of limit on the music we play." [...] Trey Spruance corroborated this. “When I was 15, I was in a death metal group," [...] Spruance reminisced. [...] "We had this idea {{that we were going to}} play a bunch of ska tunes for a bunch of metalheads. We just had this idea, you know: ‘Okay, we’re going to play this ska music, and that’ll be amazing.’ Half of the audience hated us, but there was definitely a joy in confronting that wall between styles.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{idea behind}} [...] "Rhythm of Love" [...] is, {{according}} to Rabin, [...] "just sex". By {{the time of}} the recording, he felt Yes had pushed away from the cosmic-inspired lyrics that the group were known for in the 1970s with [...] "Owner of a Lonely Heart", and thought a sex lyric would be a [...] "nice little tease". Anderson claimed the group were strong for its chorus, but he felt unsure and needed the lyrics [...] "fashioned" [...] and changed some words. [...] "Big Generator" [...] is one of the album's three tracks credited to the whole group. It developed from a riff by Squire and Rabin, originating from a specific tuning Squire had on his 5-string bass which helped to create the song, which involved contributions from White on the drums. In its early development, White felt the song needed some [...] "Yes stamps" [...] incorporated into the arrangement, and instructed the group to play a section and not listen to his playing. [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>stopped</b> and started ... like the drummer fell off his stool and then got back on trying to catch up the beat. Playing very slowly and then faster ... and then I was back in time". Once he was, [...] "I reversed the beat around backwards so I came in with the bass drum on two and four instead of one and three". [...] "Shoot High Aim Low", the second group track, was one of the songs recorded in Carimate, and features reverb that was captured naturally around the castle's acoustics, rather than reverb added electronically in the studio. White came up with the chords while he was playing in the studio with the drum box. When Rabin arrived at the studio, he told White to continue playing the beat while he started singing a melody that was used in the song. It features Anderson as [...] "the guy in the helicopter going in at ninety miles an hour and I'm going to blow everybody up", yet has Rabin's backing vocals sing a love lyric that involves a couple enjoying their company in a car. He summarised the song's message as [...] "To live beyond war". Rabin later called the song his favourite on Big Generator. Rabin called [...] "Almost Like Love" [...] a track that did not quite work in the end and wished it was not included on the album. He disagreed {{with the addition of a}} horn section, comparing it to soul music and [...] "Sussudio" [...] by Phil Collins. Squire was particularly into the song's riff, yet Rabin felt the song around it was substandard, like [...] "polishing a vase while the building was falling down".|$|E
