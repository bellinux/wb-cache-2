50|$|As {{development}} of a new main battle tank stalled with problems and cost escalating quickly, the M60A1 was forced to serve longer than originally intended with production lasting over 20 years. In that time span numerous product improvement programs were put forward. The first of which was TLAC, for Top Loading Air Cleaner. This reduced dirt and dust ingestion, which increased engine life. Its top loading configuration also made it easier to service. Next came the AOS meaning Add-On Stabilization that was introduced in late 1972. As its name implies, this was an add on stabilizer kit made to fit with minimum modifications to the existing hydraulic gun control system. It was made up of several components: the rate sensor package, a control selector box, the electronics package, a shut-off valve, the traverse servo-valve assembly, the elevation servo-valve assembly, the handle shaping assembly, an <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter,</b> and an antibacklash cylinder. At short to medium ranges, hit probabilities better than 50% from a moving M60A1 were obtained in Aberdeen test results while without a stabilizer it was essentially zero. M60A1(AOS) was the designation received by M60s equipped with the TLAC, AOS and the new T142 steel track, which had replaceable rubber pads and improved service life.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Four aspects are {{important}} {{in the design of}} hydraulic filters. We distinguish between two cost factors and two performance factors. Regarding performance, filter efficiency and filter capacity are of interest. Regarding cost, there are production considerations such as spatial restrictions, material cost and the cost of manufacturing the filter. The second type of cost is the operation cost, namely the pressure drop. Albeit simulations should and will ultimately deal with all 4 aspects, for the moment our work is focused on cost. The PleatGeo Module generates three-dimensional computer models of a single pleat of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter</b> interactively. PleatDict computes the pressure drop that will result for the particular design by direct numerical simulation. The evaluation of a new pleat design takes only a few hours on a standard PC compared to days or weeks used for manufacturing and testing a new prototype of a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter.</b> The design parameters are the shape of the pleat, the permeabilities of one or several layers of filter media and the geometry of a supporting netting structure that is used to keep the outflow area open. Besides the underlying structure generation and CFD technology, we present some trends regarding the dependence of pressure drop on design parameters that can serve as guide lines for the design of hydraulic filters.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{spectrum}} of ocean waves has a wide range of periods from capillary waves to tides. In that spectrum, long period waves, which have the periods of about 5 to 90 minutes, have been investigated with regard to destructive tsunamis and storm surges, but in recent years small tsunamis caused by earthquakes of small magnitude or long period fluctuations of the sea level caused by meteorological disturbances are being studied. Because the energy of these long period waves is very small in comparison with gravity waves or tides, a specially designed instrument with a band pass filter is necessary for the observation of such waves. The writer illustrates long period wave recorders which are provided with a <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter</b> and a pressure transducer under water. First of all, the characteristic of the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter</b> was investigated by means of the equivalent electric circuits, and the ERI-III type and the ERI-IV type tsunami recorders were designed. The ERI-IV type tsunami recorder is provided with the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter</b> which is represented by equivalent circuits shown in Fig. 3 (4), and the schematic diagram of the instrument is shown in Fig. 6, where the two stand pipes act as capacities and the two capillary tubes shown by marks Ru R 2, act as resistances. The calibration of this instrument was carried out by means of the application of the water pressure of step function type, and the spectral response curve obtained by this calibration is shown in Fig. 11. This instrument was installed at the Izu-Oshima tsunami observatory of the Earthquake Research Institute in 1960, and now is in continuous operation with a satisfactory performance. The filter similar to the above stated may be applied to other instruments, for example, to the portable long wave recorder (Fig. 15), or the microbarograph (Fig. 16), etc [...] As another application of this filtering system, a filtering device was constructed to make easy inspection of a record by attenuating the longer and the shorter period components of waves and taking out a particular period band. This device is schematicaly shown in Fig. 17. For example, if a tsunami record observed by a tide gauge is put on this device, it will be translated into a simple record, because the tide of long period and the short period waves such as seiches of a bay where the tide gauge station is located, will be attenuated in their amplitudes. These practical examples are shown in Figs. 18, 19, 20...|$|E

40|$|Endogenous and {{adventitious}} virus removal by size-exclusion {{membrane filtration}} {{is a critical}} dedicated step in an overall viral clearance strategy employed by biologics manufacturers as required by industry regulators. However, the addition of impurities from virus spike preparations used in validation studies can significantly reduce filter capacity, resulting in an oversized and suboptimal virus filtration step. The <b>hydraulic</b> <b>filter</b> performance and virus retention observed in conventional scaled-downed validation models may not necessarily represent performance observed during process development, nor be predictive of manufacturing performance. Using filter flow decay as a relevant processing endpoint, an alternative and more comprehensive approach to virus filter validation has been developed to overcome the limitations imposed by virus spike impurities. With a model feedstream, we have demonstrated comparable virus removal using the conventional virus spiking approach and a complementary preconditioned virus challenge. Similar to a currently accepted method used in the validation of sterilizing-grade filters, this method entails processing non-spiked feed to a volumetric throughput target, followed by processing virus-spiked feed to a final flow decay endpoint to determine viral clearance. This comprehensive approach yields predictive virus retention data under protein-dominant fouling conditions that better model the hydraulic performance of the manufacturing-scale virus filtration operation...|$|E

The specific project aim was to investigate methods of predicting or determining the effects of fluid contamination on this type of pump.

Statistical methods are used to develop {{a model of the}} blocking, by particles, of the control capillaries used in such bearings. The results obtained are compared to published, experimental data. Poor correlation between theory and practice suggests that more research is required in this area before such theoretical analysis can be used in industry. Accelerated wear tests have been developed in the U. S. A. in an attempt to predict pump life when operating on contaminated fluids. An analysis of such tests shows that reliability data can only be obtained from extensive test programmes. The value of contamination testing is suggested to be in determining failure modes, and in identifying those pump components which are susceptible to the effects of contamination. A suitable test is described, and the results of a series of tests on axial piston pumps are presented and discussed. The thesis concludes that pump reliability data can only be obtained from field experience.

Finished water quality for the DAF train was similar to the parallel direct filtration train as measured by turbidity, ultraviolet absorbance at 254 mn, dissolved organic carbon, and particle counts.
