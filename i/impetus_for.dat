50|$|The {{book was}} first {{published}} in 1995 by the University of California Press. A second edition was published in 1999. The second edition was updated with a preface and a recent bibliography of the works of Victor Davis Hanson. The preface to the second edition discusses the <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> the books publication.|$|R
30|$|These studies {{support the}} general use of {{sustainability}} labels but point to further {{questions to be}} answered if effectiveness is to be increased. A deeper understanding of <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> and intentions for consumers to purchase apparel with sustainability labels can help business marketers and managers tailor their sustainability messages {{in ways that will}} appeal to their target customer and encourage purchase.|$|R
50|$|They did not {{complete}} the 1955 season, as they {{dropped out of the}} League - the second squad to do so that season, following the Galveston White Caps. They played their final game of the season on June 29. Team owner J. C. Stroud cited poor attendance, personal ailing health and external pressure from other clubs to shut down the Tyler ball club as the <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> the team's dropping out.|$|R
5|$|Billie Frasier (Laura Benanti) is an anorexic and bulimic {{who also}} has issues with alcohol abuse. Billie is {{bisexual}} and was raised by two gay fathers. Formerly a ballerina, the original <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> her eating disorders, she is now a moderately well-known singer-songwriter.|$|E
5|$|One might {{surmise that}} the {{hermeneutic}} style was cultivated energetically in England {{in an attempt}} to show that English learning was as profound and English writing as sophisticated as anything produced on the Continent. The <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the cultivation of the style in tenth-century England was therefore probably of Continental origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{identification}} of {{bacteria in the}} laboratory is particularly relevant in medicine, where the correct treatment {{is determined by the}} bacterial species causing an infection. Consequently, the need to identify human pathogens was a major <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the development of techniques to identify bacteria.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the real}} <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> United States {{entering}} the Industrial Revolution was {{the passage of the}} Embargo Act of 1807, the War of 1812 (1812–14) and the Napoleonic Wars (1803–15) which cut off supplies of new and cheaper Industrial revolution products from Britain. The lack of access to these goods all provided a strong incentive to learn how to develop the industries and to make their own goods instead of simply buying the goods produced by Britain.|$|R
50|$|One of {{the primary}} <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> the {{exploration}} of artificial creation comes from the realization in the artificial life and evolutionary computing fields that some basic assumptions common in these fields represent subtle mischaracterizations of natural evolution. These fall into two general classes: 1) there are fundamental problems {{with the use of}} fitness functions for the primary synthesis of complex systems, and 2) the process of self-replication used in almost all artificial life research is not a fundamental property of self-organizing systems.|$|R
50|$|Chinese {{expansion}} {{under the}} Qin (221-206 BCE) and Han (206 BCE-220 CE) Dynasties {{is said to}} have been one of the primary <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> migrations to the Japanese archipelago, which brought with it cultural influences and new technologies. Artifacts brought to the islands at this time had a powerful effect upon the development of Japanese art, by presenting objects to imitate and copy, such as bronze mirror,(Shinju-kyo) from Chinese mythology. The Yayoi people brought Japan into the Iron Age around the 3rd century CE.|$|R
5|$|Harris {{cites the}} success of the {{adaptation}} of The X-Files for providing the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> a Millennium comic, noting that IDW editor-in-chief Chris Ryall approached him to write the latter series having seen the reception the former had been receiving. Harris himself had been a fan of the series during its initial broadcast, personally favouring its second season. He also expressed interest in possibly adapting another of Carter's creations, Harsh Realm.|$|E
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} dualism to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This dualism likely provided <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei If... was {{developed}} as a change from previous Shin Megami Tensei titles, focusing on a small-scale environment and threat rather than a large-scale environment as in previous titles. Upon release, If... received a positive reception from critics and fans, and inspired multiple tie-in print adaptations and a mobile prequel. Its well-received high school setting was the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> {{the creation of the}} spin-off Persona series.|$|E
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of our study}} is to look into possible catalytic roles that CMIM, a regional financial arrangement among ASEAN+ 3 economies and its surveillance unit(AMRO) can play in enhancing macroeconomic policy cooperation in this region. The key questions that the study hopes to address are: can CMIM and AMRO provide <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> deeper and more meaningful macroeconomic policy cooperation in the region? What are the policy areas {{and what could be}} the catalytic roles for CMIM and AMRO in promoting policy cooperation?...|$|R
50|$|The Centre for Christian Studies is {{historically}} {{rooted in the}} diaconal training schools of the Methodist and Presbyterian Churches established in Canada {{in the late nineteenth}} century. The Social Gospel Movement combined with the influence of early femenism, which was fighting for more vocational opportunities for women, as well as the increading need of churches to fill overseas missionary sites were the major <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> the formation of these schools. In 1893, the Methodist National Training Centre was opened and the Presbyterian Missionary and Deaconess Training Home followed in 1897.|$|R
2500|$|In the September 1949 {{issue of}} Life magazine, postwar Rockford was {{described}} as [...] "nearly typical of the U.S. as any city can be." [...] Due to this archetypal nature, sociologists like W. Lloyd Warner warned of the necessity to [...] "understand the realities of their system." [...] Heavily dependent on manufacturing and experiencing a shift in economic development toward its eastern borders, Rockford began to suffer irrevocable decline. <b>Impetuses</b> <b>for</b> this shift in economic development include {{the construction of the}} Northwest Tollway in 1958, the new campus for Rockford College in 1964, and the campus of Rock Valley College and the Chrysler Belvidere Assembly Plant in 1965 near the eastern periphery of the city rather than downtown.|$|R
5|$|The {{adventure}} {{begins when}} the player characters hear reports of bandits waylaying and attacking caravans in a jungle region. Most of the ambushed merchants and guards have been killed, but {{the few who}} have returned alive tell fantastic stories about deformed plants and deadly beasts in the jungle. The stolen goods taken from the caravans provide an <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the characters to enter the jungles in search of this lost treasure.|$|E
5|$|The missionaries {{were forced}} to proceed slowly, and could not do much about {{eliminating}} pagan practices, or destroying temples or other sacred sites, unlike the missionary efforts {{that had taken place}} in Gaul under St Martin. There was little fighting or bloodshed during the mission. Paganism was still practised in Kent until the 630s, and it was not declared illegal until 640. Although Honorius sent Felix to the East Angles, it appears that most of the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> conversion came from the East Anglian king.|$|E
5|$|This {{population}} {{issue was}} {{a significant part of}} the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the recent merger of Old Ikata with Seto and Misaki. While Old Ikata is geographically more accessible, and has enjoyed the economic benefits of the Ikata Nuclear Power Plant, Seto and Misaki have experienced even more severe aging and decline of their populations. In 2000, Seto's working-age population dipped below 50% of its total.|$|E
40|$|End-time {{symbolism}} {{has provided}} {{some of the}} most powerful <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> social change in history. We examine the complex nature of this end-time theology, tracing its variegated resonances across different movements in Islam. In examining movements across religious orientations, geographies, and time periods, we will grapple with some of the central questions faced by scholars in the field—questions such as the nature of mahdist authority; the ways in which apocalyptic prophecies become deployed and reinterpreted; and the nature of arguments in support of or against the mahdi’s cause. Case studies include the Abbasids; the Fatimids; the mystical messianism of Ibn al-Arabi; the Hurufi movement; and two modern movements: the Ahmadiyya and the Sudanese Mahdi...|$|R

5000|$|Johnny Marr {{has stated}} in {{interviews}} {{that one of}} the main <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> his leaving The Smiths was Morrisey's insistence on covering the titular theme song to this movie. There is a famous quote published in a 1992 issue of [...] "Record Collector" [...] where Marr disdainfully said [...] "'Work Is A Four Letter Word' I hated. That was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs. That was it, really. I made a decision that I was going to get away on holiday. The only place I could think of was L.A. L.A. was the only place I knew where there'd be sunshine, so off I went. I never saw Morrissey again." ...|$|R
5|$|Negotiations {{initially}} {{focused on}} a comprehensive ban, but this was abandoned due to technical questions surrounding the detection of underground tests and Soviet concerns over the intrusiveness of proposed verification methods. The <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the test ban was provided by rising public anxiety over the magnitude of nuclear tests, particularly tests of new thermonuclear weapons (hydrogen bombs), and the resulting nuclear fallout. A test ban was also seen {{as a means of}} slowing nuclear proliferation and the nuclear arms race. Though the PTBT did not halt proliferation or the arms race, its enactment did coincide with a substantial decline in the concentration of radioactive particles in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The {{immediate}} <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the Pennsylvanian was the discontinuance of the National Limited, a New YorkKansas City train {{which had}} provided service over the corridor. The Pennsylvanian began on April 27, 1980, as a state-supported daylight train between Philadelphia and Pittsburgh, with connecting service to New York via the Philadelphian (a Clocker) westbound and the Montrealer eastbound. At {{the time the}} Pennsylvanian was inaugurated, the Broadway Limited was departing Pittsburgh at an inconvenient early morning hour. The new train ran with Amfleet equipment, including a cafe car. Pennsylvania agreed to pay 20% of the train's costs for the first year, or $580,000, with the state and Amtrak eventually splitting the costs 50/50 by the third year.|$|E
5|$|The <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> {{federation}} did {{not extend}} to the administration of cricket, however. The ACC continued to attract criticism for being ineffectual and {{at a meeting of}} the Victorian Cricket Association in July 1898, Trott (in his capacity as a delegate for the South Melbourne club) tabled a motion that Victoria secede from the ACC. Although the proposal was defeated by a single vote, Trott was one of twelve Test players who signed a letter to the ACC secretary calling for the disbanding of the organisation. Failing to win the support of the players, the ACC folded in January 1900 following the withdrawal of the New South Wales Cricket Association.|$|E

40|$|This work {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of specialising in tourism on long-term growth in the Balearic and Canary Islands (which both are economies that have been specialising in tourism for half a century), according to Solow’s methodology. The findings show that at first, investment in physical capital {{and the creation of}} infrastructures are the main <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> growth in production and per capita income. Nevertheless, the findings also show that productivity’s contribution to growth in production is decreasing in the long run, which becomes a curb on the development of per capita income. The behaviour of total factor productivity is not accidental; it is closely linked to specialising in tourism and determines efforts to innovate and the economy’s human capital. Specialising in Tourism, Economic Growth...|$|R
40|$|This {{comprehensive}} {{survey of}} continuity {{and change in}} trade unions looks at five primarily English-speaking countries: the USA, Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the UK. The authors consider the recent re-examination by trade union movements of the basis of union organization and activity {{in the face of}} a harsher economic and political climate. One of the <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> this re-examination has been the recent history of unions in the USA. American models of renewal have inspired Australia, New Zealand and the UK, while Canada has undergone a cautious examination of the US model with an attempt to develop a distinctive approach. This book aims to provide a thorough grounding for informed discussion and debate about the position and place of trade unions in modern economies...|$|R
5|$|The {{microscopic}} {{characteristics and}} cytogenetics of C.micaceus are well known, {{and it has}} been used frequently as a model organism to study cell division and meiosis in Basidiomycetes. Chemical analysis of the fruit bodies has revealed the presence of antibacterial and enzyme-inhibiting compounds. Formerly known as Coprinus micaceus, the species was transferred to Coprinellus in 2001 as phylogenetic analyses provided the <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> a reorganization of the many species formerly grouped together in the genus Coprinus. Based on external appearance, C.micaceus is virtually indistinguishable from C.truncorum, {{and it has been}} suggested that many reported collections of the former may be of the latter.|$|E
5|$|The rivalry of Horus and Set {{is portrayed}} in two {{contrasting}} ways. Both perspectives appear {{as early as}} the Pyramid Texts, the earliest source of the myth. In some spells from these texts, Horus is the son of Osiris and nephew of Set, and the murder of Osiris is the major <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the conflict. The other tradition depicts Horus and Set as brothers. This incongruity persists in many of the subsequent sources, where the two gods may be called brothers or uncle and nephew at different points in the same text.|$|E
5|$|Warfare on the North American {{frontier}} was brutal, and {{the killing}} of prisoners, the targeting of civilians, and other atrocities were widespread. The ruthlessness and treachery of the conflict was {{a reflection of a}} growing divide between the separate populations of the British colonists and Native Americans. Contrary to popular belief, the British government did not issue the Royal Proclamation of 1763 in reaction to Pontiac's War, though the conflict did provide an <b>impetus</b> <b>for</b> the application of the Proclamation's Indian clauses. This proved unpopular with British colonists, and may {{have been one of the}} early contributing factors to the American Revolution.|$|E

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the report}} of the Victorian Legislative Council’s Legal and Social Issues Legislation Committee (‘Committee’) from its Inquiry into the Performance of the Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA). AHPRA is a national body that provides administrative support for the National Registration and Accreditation Scheme (NRAS), under which practitioners in 14 health professions across Australia are regulated. The article considers the Committee’s ﬁ ndings and recommendations in light of the <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> the creation of the NRAS, as well as the structure and implementation of the NRAS and AHPRA. It is argued that that the value of the Committee’s report is conﬁ ned to its identiﬁ cation of important issues concerning the NRAS and AHPRA that, in the near future, will require a more critical and comprehensive investigation than the Committee undertook...|$|R
50|$|In The Clansman, Reconstruction was {{an attempt}} by Augustus Stoneman, a thinly veiled {{reference}} to Thaddeus Stevens, {{to ensure that the}} Republican Party would stay in power by securing the southern black vote. His hatred for President Johnson stems from Johnson's refusal to disenfranchise whites. Stoneman's anger towards former slave holders is intensified after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, where he vows revenge on the South. His programs strip away the property owned by whites, in turn giving them to former slaves. Men claiming to represent the government confiscate the material wealth of the South, destroying plantation owning families. Finally, the former slaves are taught that they are superior to their former owners and should rise up against them. These injustices are the <b>impetuses</b> <b>for</b> the creation of the Klan.|$|R
