5|$|According to the game's back-story, Necrid {{was once}} a human warrior. He sought and found the cursed sword Soul Edge, only to be pulled into the {{dimension}} that the sword's spirit inhabits. Escaping the dimension with his body drastically mutated, his memories and sanity initially lost, he now wields various forms of energy as weapons, while searching for fragments of the shattered Soul <b>Edge</b> <b>that</b> soothe the pain caused by his separation from the dimension's energies.|$|E
5|$|Spores are thin-walled, smooth, and {{ellipsoidal}} or oval in shape. Viewed with a microscope, {{they appear}} translucent (hyaline), and stain red or blue with Melzer's reagent (in amyloid). Their dimensions are typically 7–10 by 5–7µm; the spores contain a single large oil droplet. The spore-bearing cells, the basidia, are club-shaped, two- to four-spored, and 25–30 by 5–7µm. The presence of sterile cells called pleurocystidia (large cells {{found on the}} gill face in some mushrooms) is uncommon; specimens may contain few or abundant cheilocystidia (large sterile cells found on the gill <b>edge)</b> <b>that</b> are club-shaped, thin-walled and 39–87.5 by 8.5–16µm in size.|$|E
5|$|The method {{chosen by}} PAVN {{to defeat the}} {{invasion}} was to first isolate the northern firebases by utilizing anti-aircraft artillery. The outposts would then be pounded by round-the-clock mortar, artillery, and rocket fire. Although the ARVN firebases were themselves equipped with artillery, their guns were quickly outranged by PAVN's Soviet-supplied 122mm and 130mm pieces, which simply stood off and pounded the positions at will. The defensive <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> could have been provided by the utilization of tactical B-52 bomber strikes was nullified by the close-in tactics of the communist forces. Massed ground attacks, supported by artillery and armor would then finish the job.|$|E
3000|$|...]+. We {{disallow}} those <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> {{correspond to}} rate vectors, which activate transmitters with empty queues. Therefore, {{the actual number}} of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are incident from a vertex can be less than [...]...|$|R
2500|$|Alternatively, {{a minimum}} set of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> breaks all cycles {{can be found}} by {{constructing}} a spanning forest of [...] and choosing the complementary set of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> {{do not belong to}} the spanning forest.|$|R
5000|$|... {{where the}} degree deg(x) of a vertex x {{is the number}} of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> contain x and the codegree codeg(x, y) of two {{distinct}} vertices x and y {{is the number of}} <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> contain both vertices.|$|R
5|$|If one removes from a 1-tree one of {{the edges}} in its cycle, {{the result is a}} tree. Reversing this process, if one augments a tree by {{connecting}} any two of its vertices by a new edge, the result is a 1-tree; the path in the tree connecting the two endpoints of the added edge, together with the added edge itself, form the 1-tree's unique cycle. If one augments a 1-tree by adding an <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> connects one of its vertices to a newly added vertex, the result is again a 1-tree, with one more vertex; an alternative method for constructing 1-trees is to start with a single cycle and then repeat this augmentation operation any number of times. The edges of any 1-tree can be partitioned in a unique way into two subgraphs, one of which is a cycle and the other of which is a forest, such that each tree of the forest contains exactly one vertex of the cycle.|$|E
5|$|In {{the town}} of Zoah, Edge meets an engineer, Paet, who will trade {{information}} about the Tower for ancient artifacts. Searching an ancient vessel for parts, Edge is captured by imperial soldiers but rescued by Gash. Paet reveals that the Tower {{can be reached via}} the ruins of Uru; there, Edge and the dragon are attacked again by the girl and Atolm. After the battle, separated from their dragons, he and the girl fall into an ancient underground facility and form a truce to escape. The girl explains that she is an ancient bio-engineered being named Azel, created in the facility and designed to interface with ancient technology. After Edge's dragon rescues them, Azel warns <b>Edge</b> <b>that</b> she will kill him if he crosses Craymen's path again and leaves on Atolm.|$|E
5|$|Looking to do {{a family}} film, Johnny Depp visited the Walt Disney Studios in 2001 {{when he heard}} of plans to adapt the Pirates of the Caribbean ride into a film. Depp was excited by the {{possibility}} of reviving an old Hollywood genre, and found the script met his quirky sensibilities: the crew of the Black Pearl were not in search of treasure but trying to return it to lift a curse on them, and the traditional mutiny had already occurred. Depp was cast on June 10, 2002. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer felt Depp would give the film an <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> could draw teenage and adult audiences despite Disney's reputation for soft children's fare.|$|E
30|$|Reciprocity. Reciprocity is the {{fraction}} of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are of cycle of length two. Note that reciprocity {{is related to the}} flow hierarchy because {{the fraction}}, θ, of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are in cycles of length greater than two can be computed as θ= 1 -ζ-α.|$|R
30|$|A {{deletion}} of a graph G is {{a random}} way of removing <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are not incident to vertices with zero surpluses until we cannot delete more <b>edges.</b> The <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are deleted are called surplus edges, and the deletion process is denoted by D.|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} find a HC, the <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> form it must be chosen so <b>that</b> any extra <b>edges</b> are avoided. In other words, the <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> {{do not belong to}} this cycle must be deleted. Definition 3 below {{introduces}} the primary way of deleting such edges.|$|R
5|$|Mycena galericulata {{produces}} a white spore print. The spores are , 8–10 by 5.5–7μm, and amyloid—which means they will turn blue-black to black when stained with Melzer's reagent. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) have stout sterigmata, and measure 34–40 by 7–9μm. They may be either two-spored or four-spored. There are numerous club-shaped to rounded cheilocystidia (cystidia on the gill <b>edge),</b> <b>that</b> measure 32–40 by 8–12μm; their apices or the entire enlarged portion bear rodlike projections that become increasingly elongated and branched in age. There are no pleurocystidia (cystidia on the gill face). The gill tissue {{has a very}} thin cuticle, under which is a narrow hypoderm, while {{the remainder of the}} tissue comprises densely matted tufts of mycelia, and stains deep vinaceous-brown in iodine. Clamp connections are present in the hyphae of the four-spored forms.|$|E
5|$|The Huon Peninsula {{campaign}} {{was a series}} of battles fought in north-eastern Papua New Guinea in 1943–1944 during the Second World War. The campaign formed the initial part of an offensive that the Allies launched in the Pacific in late 1943 and resulted in the Japanese being pushed north from Lae to Sio on the northern coast of New Guinea {{over the course of a}} four-month period. For the Australians, a significant advantage was gained through the technological <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> Allied industry had achieved over the Japanese by this phase of the war, while the Japanese were hampered by a lack of supplies and reinforcements due to Allied interdiction efforts at sea and in the air.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{then headed}} to The Oval for the Fifth Test. Barnes {{returned}} from injury, so Hassett {{returned to his}} customary position in the middle order. England elected to bat on a rain-affected pitch. Propelled by Lindwall's 6/20, the tourists skittled Yardley’s men for 52 in 42.1 overs on the first afternoon. With the score at 1/10, Bill Edrich attempted to hook a short ball from Bill Johnston. Edrich failed {{to get the ball}} {{in the middle of the}} bat and it looped up and travelled around 10m. Hassett caught the ball just behind square leg, diving sideways to get two hands to the ball. Soon after, Lindwall bounced Compton, resulting in an <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> appeared to be heading towards the slips cordon. However, the ball cleared the ring of Australian fielders. Hutton called Compton through for a run, but his surprised partner was too busy watching the ball and dropped his bat in panic. Luckily for Compton, the ball went to Hassett at third man, who waited for Compton to regain his bat and composure before returning the ball, thereby forfeiting the opportunity to effect the run out. However, Compton only made four before being dismissed, so Australia lost little from Hassett's sportsmanship.|$|E
40|$|Inference of new {{biological}} knowledge, e. g., {{prediction of}} protein function, from protein-protein interaction (PPI) networks has received {{attention in the}} post-genomic era. A popular strategy has been to cluster the network into functionally coherent groups of proteins and predict protein function from the clusters. Traditionally, network {{research has focused on}} clustering of nodes. However, why favor nodes over edges, when clustering of edges may be preferred? For example, nodes belong to multiple functional groups, but clustering of nodes typically cannot capture the group overlap, while clustering of edges can. Clustering of adjacent <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> share many neighbors was proposed recently, outperforming different node clustering methods. However, since some biological processes can have characteristic "signatures" throughout the network, not just locally, it may be of interest to consider <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are not necessarily adjacent. Hence, we design a sensitive measure of the "topological similarity" of <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> can deal with <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are not necessarily adjacent. We cluster <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> are similar according to our measure in different baker's yeast PPI networks, outperforming existing node and edge clustering approaches...|$|R
50|$|In mathematics, {{and more}} {{specifically}} in graph theory, a multigraph (in contrast to a simple graph) is a graph which is permitted to have multiple edges (also called parallel <b>edges),</b> <b>that</b> is, <b>edges</b> <b>that</b> have the same end nodes. Thus two vertices may be connected {{by more than one}} edge.|$|R

5|$|Directed pseudoforests and endo{{function}}s are in {{some sense}} mathematically equivalent. Any function ƒ from a set X to itself (that is, an endomorphism of X) {{can be interpreted as}} defining a directed pseudoforest which has an edge from x to y whenever ƒ(x) = y. The resulting directed pseudoforest is maximal, and may include self-loops whenever some value x has ƒ(x) = x. Alternatively, omitting the self-loops produces a non-maximal pseudoforest. In the other direction, any maximal directed pseudoforest determines a function ƒ such that ƒ(x) is the target of the <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> goes out from x, and any non-maximal directed pseudoforest can be made maximal by adding self-loops and then converted into a function in the same way. For this reason, maximal directed pseudoforests are sometimes called functional graphs. Viewing a function as a functional graph provides a convenient language for describing properties that are not as easily described from the function-theoretic point of view; this technique is especially applicable to problems involving iterated functions, which correspond to paths in functional graphs.|$|E
5|$|The lichen has a {{distinct}} prothallus—fibers of whitish fungal hyphae at the <b>edge</b> <b>that</b> lack photobiont, and which project beyond the thallus onto the growing surface. The prothallus is red to whitish in the inner part, red the in outer part. The surface of the thallus {{does not have a}} well-defined cortex, an outer layer of well-packed hyphae. The medulla (a loosely arranged layer of hyphae below the cortex and photobiont zone) is whitish but the lower part is red. It has few to many calcium oxalate crystals that are 3–8μm diameter. The hyphae of the medulla have many such crystals on the walls, that are 1–2μm in diameter. The algal photobiont (technically a phycobiont, as it is a green algal photosynthetic partner) is from the genus Trentepohlia. Normally, the algae is long and filamentous; when in the lichen state, it is divided into shorter filaments. The alga has a large chloroplast that contains droplets of beta-carotene. The lichen is heteromerous, meaning that the mycobiont and photobiont components are in well-defined layers, with the photobiont in a more or less distinct zone between the upper cortex and the medulla. Cells are single or a few cells aggregated, with dimensions of about 8–15 by 5–11μm.|$|E
