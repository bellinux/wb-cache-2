40|$|The {{migration}} of health professionals to greener pastures negatively {{impacts on the}} healthservice delivery of the source countries. The trend is that doctors and nurses migrate fromrural areas to urban areas or from developing countries to developed countries in search ofbetter economic welfare and working conditions. In search of the same conditions, healthprofessionals also migrate from the public sector to the private sector. The causes for thismigration, which are largely viewed to be of economic nature, constitute the ‘push’ and‘pull’ factors. It is these factors that policy-makers should carefully study in order to arrestthe medical brain drain. Zimbabwe has not been spared of this phenomenon. In theprocess, the poor, and especially in rural areas, have been the worst victims. ZimbabweanGovernment policies, though well-intended, have not been adequate enough to arrest thesituation. This paper argues that an <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approach</b> is best positioned toaddress the brain drain problem, which has negatively impacted on the health servicedelivery system. The <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approach</b> takes cognizance of the various factorsthat constitute the complex nature of the brain drain.

40|$|Governments have {{struggled}} to successfully implement large-scale <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches,</b> often resulting in policy failure. However, {{there has been little}} investigation into why this is the case. This paper links the discourse on <b>policy</b> failure and <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> and identifies what aspects of ‘integration’ cause failure. It argues that programme failure occurs in <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> when there are unachievable goals or timelines, poor policy design and/or when the incorrect types of processes are selected. Policy process failure is particularly evident in an <b>integrated</b> <b>policy’s</b> implementation where multi-sector and multi-level issues arise, whereas failure in the politics of integrated approaches is found in political gain and blame avoidance of key decision-makers. This framework is then applied to Australia’s Oceans Policy demonstrating that it was unable to achieve its original objectives; the layering process of new policy and institutions on established silos was ineffective; and the new institutions did not have the integrative capacity required for successful implementation. The Australian experience reveals that an institutional model that can deal with multiple issues, jurisdictions and sectors holistically is essential if integrative capacity is to be achieved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractFor {{some time}} {{there has been}} a {{proposition}} in forestry and nature conservation disciplines that timber plantations can potentially support natural forest conservation outcomes when wood logged in extensive natural forests is substituted by wood production from smaller areas of intensive timber plantations. Here, we have called this the plantation conservation benefit. We review evidence from the literature of this intuitively appealing proposition, both empirical and theoretical, and add emphasis on methods (theoretical modelling, econometrics and descriptive statistics) in order to explicitly address causative mechanisms and potential negative or positive feedback processes. This understanding is critical to developing effective policy. We find a convergence of conclusions of reduced degradation of natural forests associated with the expansion of timber plantations, but also potential increased deforestation due to either lower market value of natural forests in the absence of logging, or displacement effects. Yet, a main limitation of studies is the lack of consideration of the role of policies and institutions beyond market drivers, especially in econometric studies. We conclude on the need for <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> applied simultaneously to both natural forests and plantations to maximize the potential benefit...|$|R
40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{the necessity}} {{and benefits of}} developing <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> to the energy systems in general, and power systems in particular were assessed. The research work covers not only the integration of energy and environment policy objectives, but also the integration of different policy instruments along the power system. A two part methodology was developed: 1) a framework to map and qualitatively assess the most relevant interactions between the energy and environment policy instruments currently in place, and 2) a complementary methodology to quantify {{the effects of the}} most relevant interactions using an optimisation bottom-up energy system model (TIMES model). It is concluded that there are relevant interactions between current energy and environment policies instruments along the power system. These are named co-effects and can be either synergetic or antagonistic. It was found that antagonistic co-effects affect effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of the policy instruments and can represent a significant cost for the overall energy system.

40|$|This talk {{will focus}} on one {{important}} dimension of existing poverty and inequalities – the inadequate provision and distribution of electricity infrastructure. Despite dramatic advances {{in science and technology}} and rapid economic growth, over 40 % of the globe’s population still struggles to meet even basic needs, and inequalities persist and are even rising. Inequalities in income mirror those in final energy use and inequalities in electricity access and use are even starker. Finding effective ways to eliminate extreme deprivations and inequalities begs for the application of new approaches that better integrate across multiple perspectives and dimensions and for advances in methods that better represent existing heterogeneities and distributions. Past approaches to electrification that have taken singular perspectives have, in general, been less successful than approaches that have integrated the provisioning of electricity within wider developmental and poverty alleviation efforts. The effective implementation of such <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches,</b> in turn, can result in synergies and co-benefits by way of improvements in additional dimensions of human well-being. Identifying and estimating the multiple benefits of even single interventions like improved electricity access are crucial.

40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the dynamic-incentive effect of environmental policy instruments when innovation is uncertain and occurs in very complex industrial subsystems. The case of end-of-life vehicles (ELVs) is considered focusing predominantly {{on the effects}} of the European Directive adopted in 2000 which stipulated economic instruments as free take-back, and on the voluntary agreements in place in many EU countries. The ELV case study {{is an example of a}} framework where policy-making faces an intrinsic dynamic and systemic environment. Coherent sequences of single innovations taking place in both upstream (car making) and downstream (car recycling/recovery) of the ELV system can give rise to different “innovation paths”, in accordance with cost-benefit considerations, technological options and capabilities associated to the different industrial actors involved. The impact of economic instruments on innovation paths, in particular free take-back, is considered. Deficiencies or difficulties concerning the transmission of incentives between different industries can prevent the creation of new recycling/recovery/reuse markets, giving rise to other less preferable and unexpected outcomes.

30|$|Reducing {{greenhouse}} gas emissions in the transport sector is a significant challenge. Progress {{in this area is}} very disparate from country to country, but it is apparent, as explored in this paper, that policies are the vital element that can explain these differences. Policy packaging and integration is a vital element of the (relative) successes. Policies have to be designed {{to be part of a}} consistent framework, with the aim of improving vehicle fleet efficiency, encouraging efficient vehicle use, enouraging shifts and low-carbon transport modes and reduce the overall travel demand. If applied in isolation these measures are unlikely to achieve their stated goals of reducing overall emissions and increasing transport sector energy efficiency. For example, vehicle standards alone are likely to increase the fleet’s efficiency, but this improvement is likely to be offset by increased vehicle use (rebound effect). Similarly, increased fuel taxes, without the provision of modal alternatives and/or measures to ensure a supply of efficient vehicles, would impact negatively on mobility and transport affordability. Hence a balanced and <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approach</b> is needed that combines vehicle efficiency standards, fuel tax, differentiated vehicle taxes with the provision of modal choices and compact city design.|$|E

However, this poses a challenge in developing countries, including South Africa, because such countries have weak institutions and limited access to technology. Another concern is a wide gap between the cost of adapting and the necessary financial support from the government.

40|$|This study {{identifies}} systemic {{problems and}} opportunities for transitions in water harvesting − a water conserving agricultural practice − {{in the context of}} a developing country pursuing greater agricultural sustainability. We utilize a combined and enriched functional-structural technological innovation system (TIS) analysis to identify systemic problems in the water harvesting TIS in rainfed agricultural production systems of Jordan. Results indicate Jordanian water harvesting TIS development is hindered by three principal blocking mechanisms: 1) inadequate financial resources to support innovation; 2) lack of a common vision across government ministries; 3) institutional problems that inhibit legitimizing the technology. These challenges are caused by interlocking systemic problems, which indicate the need for <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> and interventions. Our analysis reinforces the concept that in developing countries, donor interventions should be centrally considered because they play a role in influencing priorities throughout the system and in supporting TIS development. Donors can counteract TIS development and contribute to directionality problems that favor one form of the technology over another, which gives insufficient protection for the water harvesting TIS until markets for technologies form. This would require more effective coordination between different donors’ efforts to develop critical mass in TIS development. We also show that cultural institutions and interactions between formal and informal land tenure laws play a significant role in causing an erosion of trust in the government and counter efforts to promote and engage farming communities in water harvesting activities and innovation. This requires recognition that, in developing countries, informal institutions may have the same status as formal institutions...|$|R

40|$|The Lancet Commission (2010) {{review of}} the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) for gender {{equality}} and empowerment problematised, amongst other aspects, gaps in the international and national prioritisation of concerns regarding reproductive health rights and violence against women. Matters of equity and ownership consistently emerge as significant challenges in applying a rights-based approach, to issues of justice for women (Kabeer 2003, Heyzer 2005) through education (Unterhalter 2010). According to Sen (2001) gender-based mortality inequalities are a global reality- especially in Asia and North Africa. This paper draws on ethnographic research with different dais (traditional midwives) practicing and resisting female infanticide in two villages in Bihar, India. Through ethnographic vignettes the paper explores ways in which gender-based mortality inequalities are intertwined with socio-economic and cultural relations, within the institution of family and in wider society, creating collusion between dais, families and patriarchal roles and values that perpetuate the practice of female infanticide (see Janaki, Chandrasekarayya, and Murthy 2011).

40|$|As {{countries}} around the world face urgent agricultural challenges, the concept of ?climate-smart? agriculture (CSA) has been put forward to achieve climate change adaptation, mitigation, and food security synergistically. A new report explores how three countries are using <b>integrated</b> <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> to CSA and offers insights for how other countries can build CSA into their policy mix. Brazil has invested in research to support sustainable intensification while creating legal and enforcement mechanisms to protect forest areas as a response to unrestrained agricultural expansion driven by market demand. Ethiopia initiated innovative participatory watershed development programs, in partnership with numerous international institutions, which helped smallholder farmers to rehabilitate marginal land and break out of a poverty cycle. New Zealand has removed agricultural subsidies while partnering on research and development with the private sector as a way to ensure efficiency and resilience in an agricultural sector influenced by climate change and international trade dynamics. To assemble an integrated set of national policies that fosters CSA, governments will need context-specific assessments, strong multi-stakeholder institutions, coordination frameworks, and multi-scale information systems. Governments can select from an array of policy instruments ranging from regulatory mechanisms and economic incentives to public investments and educational campaigns. Many existing national policy goals and public programs designed to increase agricultural production, improve livelihoods, and reduce environmental risks can become important pillars of a national CSA strategy. Countries have obvious interests in fostering an agriculture sector that is climate-resilient, provides national needs for food, fiber, and fuel, and supports farm livelihoods. However, the incentives for national-level action toward reducing global greenhouse gas (GHG) levels are less clear in the absence of serious and shared international commitment. <b>Integrated</b> national CSA <b>policies</b> will be encouraged by clear, consistent signals from multilateral agencies, global donors, and international conventions and trade agreements that promote agriculture as a pathway for poverty reduction and food security. 201...|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} model {{comparison}} study that combines multiple integrated assessment models with a reduced-form global air quality model {{to assess the}} potential co-benefits of global climate mitigation policies {{in relation to the}} World Health Organization (WHO) goals on air quality and health. We include in our assessment, a range of alternative assumptions on the implementation of current and planned pollution control policies. The resulting air pollution emission ranges significantly extend those in the Representative Concentration Pathways. Climate mitigation policies complement current efforts on air pollution control through technology and fuel transformations in the energy system. A combination of stringent policies on air pollution control and climate change mitigation results in 40 % of the global population exposed to PM levels below the WHO air quality guideline; with the largest improvements estimated for India, China, and Middle East. Our results stress the importance of <b>integrated</b> multisector <b>policy</b> <b>approaches</b> to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. JRC. C. 5 -Air and Climat...|$|R
