50|$|Indoor {{water use}} {{includes}} water flows through <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances</b> inside the house. The average daily indoor water use per household (averaging 2.65 {{people in the}} North American sample) ranged from zero to 644 gphd (gallons per household per day) and averaged 138 gphd, with standard deviation of about 80 gphd) or 521 liters per day and standard deviation of 300 liters. The equivalent average use per person is 52.1 gpcd (gallons per capita per day) or 197 liters per capita per day. Because the distribution of indoor use in the sample of homes is positively skewed, a more appropriate {{measure of central tendency}} is the median, which is about 125 gphd (or 472 lphd). Toilet flushing is the largest indoor use of water, followed by flows through kitchen and bathroom faucets, showers, clothes washers, leaks, bathtubs, other/miscellaneous uses, and dishwashers. Since the late 1990s, total indoor use has decreased by 22 percent, primarily due to the improved water efficiency of clothes washers and toilets.|$|E
50|$|Residential indoor {{water use}} can vary {{considerably}} across households {{depending on the}} number of residents (or more specifically, on the size and family composition of each household) and other circumstances (both systematic and random). It also depends on the contribution of the various domestic purposes of water use to the variability of total indoor use. The distributions of the observed average daily volumes for eight major end uses of water also shows considerable variability and a skew toward the right hand tails of the distributions (the data on the figure with distributions of end use volumes are truncated at 120 gpd to enhance the separation of the distribution graphs; in order to include all observations within the right tail of the distributions would require extending the horizontal scale to 560 gpd (to capture the maximum observed volumes of 553 gphd for leaks, 345 gphd for faucets and 223 gphd for toilets). Among the eight indoor end uses, five (i.e., leaks, toilet flushing, showering, clothes washing and faucet use) show pronounced right skew in their distributions that contributes to the “fatter” and longer right-hand tail in total indoor use. Significant reductions in some end uses of water could be achieved not only through the adoption of efficient technologies (i.e., <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances)</b> but also through consumers' small behavioral changes to reduce water use and wastage and by eliminating customer side leakage through automated metering and leak alert programs.|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{achieving}} water efficiency in buildings has increasingly {{become an important}} challenge in the scope of sustainability. Water consumption {{is directly related to}} individual conduct. Despite the various technological improvements in <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances,</b> their performance will be influenced by human preferences and behavior. As a result, the potential for effective water consumption saving is influenced by behavior change as well as water-efficient <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances.</b> This work evaluates the impact of user preferences and behavior change on the water-efficient performance of tap aerators in a case study building: the Department of Civil Engineering building of the University of Aveiro, Portugal. Four aerators with different discharge reductions and types were installed in the toilet’s washbasins and the user’s preferences and behavior change measured through direct and online questionnaires. It was observed that the effective water consumption reduction (15 to 49 %) was less than the discharge reduction (30 to 70 %), confirming that user factors influence water savings. Water use reductions in the tested range (2. 0 to 6. 7 l/min) also varied according to gender, with male users using less water than their female counterparts. It was noted that an awareness of sustainability values prevailed amongst the users when confronted with the choice between comfort and water efficiency, although differences were observed in the user preferences regarding the various aerators. When confronted with the information that the lower discharge aerator would contribute to a reduction of about 70 % on the water discharge, 25 % of the users agreed with its use, even if it resulted in a certain degree of dissatisfaction. In comparison, only 8 % of the users completely disagreed with its installation. On average, the water consumption reduction was 46 % smaller than the discharge reduction achievable with the aerator alone. This further confirms the user factors inform the degree of water savings that is achievable from water-efficient fittings and fixtures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{present the}} first {{longitudinal}} study of pressure sensing to infer real-world water usage events in the home (e. g., dishwasher, upstairs bathroom sink, downstairs toilet). In order to study the pressure-based approach out in the wild, we deployed a ground truth sensor network for five weeks in three homes and two apartments that directly monitored valve-level water usage by <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances.</b> We use this data to, first, demonstrate the practical challenges in constructing water usage activity inference algorithms and, second, to inform {{the design of a}} new probabilistic-based classification approach. Inspired by algorithms in speech recognition, our novel Bayesian approach incorporates template matching, a language model, grammar, and prior probabilities. We show that with a single pressure sensor, our probabilistic algorithm can classify real-world water usage at the fixture level with 90 % accuracy and at the fixturecategory level with 96 % accuracy. With two pressure sensors, these accuracies increase to 94 % and 98 %. Finally, we show how our new approach can be trained with fewer examples than a strict template-matching approach alone...|$|E
40|$|Knowing water {{consumption}} patterns in buildings is key information for water planning. This article aims {{to characterize the}} {{water consumption}} pattern and water end-uses in low-income houses {{in the region of}} Florianópolis, Southern Brazil. Data were collected by interviewing householders, as well as by measuring the flow rate of existing water <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances.</b> The results indicated that the shower was the fixture with the largest water consumption in households, i. e., about 30 %– 36 % of total water consumption on average, followed by the toilet (18 %– 20 %). The surveyed households consumed from 111 to 152 L/capita·day on average, based on different income ranges. No correlation was found between income and water consumption. The results of this study can be used to estimate the consumption of water for new buildings, as well as to develop integrated water management strategies in low-income developments, in Florianópolis, such as water-saving plumbing fixtures, rainwater harvesting, and greywater reuse.

40|$|The U. S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) {{influences}} {{the market for}} plumbing <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> fittings by encouraging consumers to purchase products that carry the WaterSense label, which certifies those products as performing at low flow rates compared to unlabeled <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> fittings. As consumers decide to purchase water-efficient products, water consumption will decline nationwide. Decreased water consumption should prolong the operating life of water and wastewater treatment facilities. This report describes the method used to calculate national water savings attributable to EPA?s WaterSense program. A Microsoft Excel spreadsheet model, the National Water Savings (NWS) analysis model, accompanies this methodology report. Version 1. 0 of the NWS model evaluates indoor residential water consumption. Two additional documents, a Users? Guide to the spreadsheet model and an Impacts Report, accompany the NWS model and this methodology document. Altogether, these four documents represent Phase One of this project. The Users? Guide leads policy makers through the spreadsheet options available for projecting the water savings that result from various policy scenarios. The Impacts Report shows national water savings that will result from differing degrees of market saturation of high-efficiency water-using products. This detailed methodology report describes the NWS analysis model, which examines the effects of WaterSense by tracking the shipments of products that WaterSense has designated as water-efficient. The model estimates market penetration of products that carry the WaterSense label. Market penetration is calculated for both existing and new construction. The NWS model estimates savings based on an accounting analysis of water-using products and of building stock. Estimates of future national water savings will help policy makers further direct the focus of WaterSense and calculate stakeholder impacts from the program. Calculating the total gallons of water the WaterSense program saves nationwide involves integrating two components, or modules, of the NWS model. Module 1 calculates the baseline national water consumption of typical <b>fixtures,</b> fittings, <b>and</b> <b>appliances</b> prior to the program (as described in Section 2. 0 of this report). Module 2 develops trends in efficiency for water-using products both in the business-as-usual case {{and as a result}} of the program (Section 3. 0). The NWS model combines the two modules to calculate total gallons saved by the WaterSense program (Section 4. 0). Figure 1 illustrates the modules and the process involved in modeling for the NWS model analysis. The output of the NWS model provides the base case for each end use, as well as a prediction of total residential indoor water consumption during the next two decades. Based on the calculations described in Section 4. 0, we can project a timeline of water savings attributable to the WaterSense program. The savings increase each year as the program results in the installation of greater numbers of efficient products, which come to compose more and more of the product stock in households throughout the United States...|$|R

Utilities need to know how low household and per capita water demands are likely to fall and what factors affect these demands. The data offer some reliable relationships on the question of future water demands. Water use in single-family residences has declined since 1995, and this trend is expected to continue as new technologies enter the market. These declines are not a result of the 2008 reces-sion—the majority of the data were collected before the last quarter of 2008 when the recession began.

40|$|Waternomics is a European Union-funded {{research}} project aspiring {{to develop and}} introduce Information and Communication Technology (ICT) as an enabling technology to manage water as a resource, increase end-user conservation awareness, affect behavioural changes and avoid water losses through leak detection. Existing leakage detection methods are generally focused on scrutinising large diameter pipes in water supply distribution networks or transmission pipes. However, {{it has been estimated}} that the average household's leaks can be as much as 35 m 3 of water per year. In order to solve the problem, analysis of different types of data in the household piping system is required, including detection and identification. One conventional approach is to use flow sensors installed at several locations within the household piping system and perform a mass balance approach to detect leakage. However, this method is expensive and difficult to implement. This research proposes a novel approach to household leakage detection by means of sound signal recordings. The approach consists of recording the sound signals that are produced by water <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances,</b> and then use these recordings to detect any abnormal situation which may be an indication of a leak. The method comprises three major steps: recording, storing and processing of sound signals. The recording step is done by means of a non-intrusive sound sensor that sends records remotely; the storage step is made in a database of sound signals for different types of uses; finally, the processing step is made through a sound signal identification software tool that is able to search the database libraries for related sounds, in a similar way as the Shazam app for music. Tests of the leak detection method are presented for data collected in laboratory conditions. Results show that this detection method has a potential to help reducing leakages through an easy-to-install and non-intrusive sensor. </p...|$|E
40|$|This paper uses a {{detailed}} water end use data registry {{generated from the}} South East Queensland Residential End Use Study (SEQREUS) to examine (a) peak hourly and daily demand, and (b) water-related energy demand. The impact of water-efficient <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances,</b> as required by current building codes in Queensland, is also explored. The four peak demand days selected had increasing peak day factors of 1. 3, 1. 5, 1. 6 and 1. 7. The range of these values is slightly lower than those used in the Department of Environment and Resource Management (DERM) guidelines where the peak day factors range from 1. 5 to 2. 3, suggesting that the frequency and volume of peaking factors may be lower than those that are currently being used for network distribution design; due likely to the high penetration of water-efficient technology and growing water conservation awareness by consumers. This type of knowledge can facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the subsequent deferral of such assets. In terms of water-related energy demand, {{it was found that}} the hot water components of showers, and to a lesser extent, taps and clothes washers were the most influential. Shower energy consumption for electric cylinder hot water systems (HWS) and solar electric-boosted HWS was 810 and 351 kWh/p/year, respectively. The type of hot water system was significant in dictating the volume of energy-related carbon emissions, with the results confirming the significant impact that electric storage water heating has on total household energy consumption and related carbon emissions. Substantial savings can be achieved by substituting water (eg, high star rating clothes washers and shower heads) and energy (eg, solar hot water system) efficient appliances in the home. Knowledge on the end uses that are influencing peak water and energy demand can: 1) facilitate the optimisation of infrastructure design and sizing and inform the decision process regarding subsequent deferral of these expensive assets; and 2) underpin future sustainability codes for new buildings.

40|$|In {{the midst}} of all the foreclosures {{sweeping}} the country, and the turmoil on Wall Street, nonprofit housing organizations are quietly going about the work of stabilizing communities hard hit by the crisis. Most have had frontline responsibility for counseling families threatened with foreclosure. With their assistance tens of thousands of families have restructured their budgets, negotiated with servicers to modify their loans, and saved their homes. Other families, too far along in the foreclosure process to stop it from happening, have received help transitioning to new housing arrangements. While the work with distressed homeowners must continue, nonprofits are feeling increased pressure to deal with the growing foreclosed housing stock. These units are causing incalculable harm to neighborhoods, and any hope of housing recovery must ensure that these units are swiftly put back into productive use or demolished. This collection of 14 case studies outlines strategies that nonprofit organizations across the country are using {{to begin the process of}} repairing damaged communities. The stakes are enormous. Vacant housing invites vandalism, and becomes a hub for gangs and crime. Virtually all case study subjects reported that, within weeks of housing becoming vacant, thieves break into the units and strip them of their valuable copper plumbing and wiring, heedless of any destruction they leave in their wake. In Phoenix a half-finished, abandoned subdivision was used as an informal "Home Depot" as other homeowners broke in and helped themselves to <b>fixtures</b> <b>and</b> <b>appliances.</b> In Cleveland, vandals remove not just the copper but the aluminum siding from vacant houses. In photos these houses have a desolate, post-disaster look, like the aftermath of a hurricane. When units get demolished the vacant lots soon sprout grass and trash, adding to the community's forlorn appearance. Vacant, deteriorated units place a downward pressure on housing values that puts nearby neighbors in a bind. In order to sell their units they will have to reduce the price, as no one will pay top dollar to live in a blighted neighborhood. Yet their ability to refinance into a more affordable mortgage may be compromised by the drop in property values; in some cases this leads to additional foreclosures and the downward cycle continues. Intervening in these troubled neighborhoods is challenging. In some markets housing prices are still falling, making it hard to determine the value of the units. Bank asset managers and servicers often lack detailed knowledge of the markets, or even of the units they have in their own inventory. This leads them to overvalue their properties and hold out for more than they are worth, delaying the process of acquiring and renovating them for resale to new homebuyers. Finally, the complex ownership structure of mortgages which were rolled into collateralized debt obligations and other investment vehicles makes it very difficult to establish who owns properties and who has authority to negotiate their sale. 0...|$|E
