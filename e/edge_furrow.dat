40|$|During cytokinesis, {{cleavage}} furrow invagination {{requires an}} actomyosin-based contractile ring and addition of new membrane. Little {{is known about}} how this actin and membrane traffic to the cleavage furrow. We address this through live analysis of fluorescently tagged vesicles in postcellularized Drosophila melanogaster embryos. We find that during cytokinesis, F-actin and membrane are targeted as a unit to invaginating furrows through formation of F-actin–associated vesicles. F-actin puncta strongly colocalize with endosomal, but not Golgi-derived, vesicles. These vesicles are recruited to the cleavage furrow along the central spindle and a distinct population of microtubules (MTs) {{in contact with the}} leading furrow <b>edge</b> (<b>furrow</b> MTs). We find that Rho-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor mutants, pebble (pbl), severely disrupt this F-actin–associated vesicle transport. These transport defects are a consequence of the pbl mutants' inability to properly form furrow MTs and the central spindle. Transport of F-actin–associated vesicles on furrow MTs and the central spindle is thus an important mechanism by which actin and membrane are delivered to the cleavage furrow...|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn cleavingXenopuseggs, {{exposure}} to nocodazole or cold shock prevents {{the addition of}} new plasma membrane to the cleavage plane and causes furrows to recede, suggesting a specific role for microtubules in cytokinesis. Whole-mount confocal immunocytochemistry reveals a ring of radially arranged, acetylated microtubule bundles {{at the base of}} all advancing cleavage furrows, from the first cleavage through the midblastula stage. We hypothesize that this novel microtubular structure is involved in transporting maternal stores of membrane in the subcortex to a site of membrane addition near the leading <b>edge</b> of the <b>furrow...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{fruit body}} of Lenzites warnieri is a flattened, semicircular or two-part cap divided {{through a small}} recess. It is resupinate (crust-like), lacks a stipe, and sits {{directly}} on the host tree. The cap is 5 - 20 cm wide (very rarely up to 45 cm), 3 - 8 cm wide from the top to the edge and 1 - 2 cm high. The surface of the young fruit bodies has a velvet texture, but it becomes bald and smooth in maturity and produces small humps or warts. The colour is light cream in young fungi and grey in old fungi. The surface is distinctly zoned; the zone <b>edges</b> are <b>furrowed</b> and dark brown to black. The trama has a tough leathery and corky consistency, but is relatively thin and does not show a definite transition to the gills. The gills are ochre or parchment-coloured, bifurcated, and its body is comparatively deep, up to 1 cm. Below {{the top of the}} cap, they move maze-like into each other. When stained with cresyl blue, the hyphae turn dark blue, indicating an orthochromatic reaction.|$|R

The additional membrane for this areal expansion has been thought to be provided entirely from cytoplasmic stores during furrowing.

40|$|Anillin is a 190 kDa actin-binding {{protein that}} {{concentrates}} in the leading <b>edges</b> of <b>furrow</b> canals during Drosophila cellularization {{and in the}} cleavage furrow of both somatic and meiotic cells. We analyzed anillin behavior during D. melanogaster spermatogenesis, {{and focused on the}} relationships between this protein and the F-actin enriched structures. In meiotic anaphases anillin concentrates in a narrow band around the cell equator. Cytological analysis of wild-type meiosis and examination of mutants defective in contractile ring assembly (chickadee and KLP 3 A), revealed that the formation of the anillin cortical band occurs before, and does not require the assembly of the F-actin based contractile ring. However, once the acto-myosin ring is assembled, the anillin band precisely colocalizes with this cytokinetic structure, accompanying its contraction throughout anaphase and telophase. In chickadee and KLP 3 A mutant ana-telophases the cortical anillin band fails to constrict, indicating that its contraction is normally driven by the cytokinetic ring. These findings, coupled with the analysis of anillin behavior in twinstar mutants, suggested a model on the role of anillin during cytokinesis. During anaphase anillin would concentrate in the cleavage furrow before the assembly of the contractile ring, binding the equatorial cortex, perhaps through its carboxy-terminal pleckstrin homology (PH) domain. Anillin would then interact with the actin filaments of the acto-myosin ring through its actin-binding domain, anchoring the contractile ring to the plasma membrane throughout cytokinesis...|$|R

5000|$|Soomaspis splendida is {{estimated}} to be over 3 cm (1.2 inches) along the axis, [...] times longer than wide. The dorsal exoskeleton consists of a cephalon, a pygidium and two or three thoracic somites with articulating half-rings, all non-calcified, supposedly of medium convexity. The axis is poorly defined. The cephalon is transversely oval, widest at midlength. The cephalon is wider than the pygidium. Eyes are absent. Antennas are not known. The body is constricted at the three thoracic somites, so the animal gives the impression to have a waist. The pygidium is slightly wider than long, with the greatest width at midlength. The pygidium has a mid-ridge and five segments divided by clear furrows on the outer parts of the pleural field. The back <b>edge</b> of these <b>furrows</b> curve backwards, ending at a sharp angle to the pygidial margin.|$|R
40|$|The endosomal-sorting complex {{required}} for transport (ESCRT) is evolutionarily conserved from Archaea to eukaryotes. The complex drives membrane scission {{events in a}} range of processes, including cytokinesis in Metazoa and some Archaea. CdvA is the protein in Archaea that recruits ESCRT-III to the membrane. Using electron cryotomography (ECT), we find that CdvA polymerizes into helical filaments wrapped around liposomes. ESCRT-III proteins are responsible for the cinching of membranes and have been shown to assemble into helical tubes in vitro, but here we show that they also can form nested tubes and nested cones, which reveal surprisingly numerous and versatile contacts. To observe the ESCRT–CdvA complex in a physiological context, we used ECT to image the archaeon Sulfolobus acidocaldarius and observed a distinct protein belt at the leading <b>edge</b> of constriction <b>furrows</b> in dividing cells. The known dimensions of ESCRT-III proteins constrain their possible orientations within each of these structures and point to the involvement of spiraling filaments in membrane scission...|$|R
40|$|Pav-KLP is the Drosophila {{member of}} the MKLP 1 family {{essential}} for cytokinesis. In the syncytial blastoderm embryo, GFP-Pav-KLP cyclically associates with astral, spindle, and midzone microtubules and also to actomyosin pseudocleavage furrows. As the embryo cellularizes, GFP-Pav-KLP also localizes to the leading <b>edge</b> of the <b>furrows</b> that form cells. In mononucleate cells, nuclear localization of GFP-Pav-KLP is mediated through NLS elements in its C-terminal domain. Mutants in these elements that delocalize Pav-KLP to the cytoplasm in interphase do not affect cell division. In mitotic cells, one population of wild-type GFP-Pav-KLP associates with the spindle and concentrates in the midzone at anaphase B. A second is at the cell cortex on mitotic entry and later concentrates {{in the region of}} the cleavage furrow. An ATP binding mutant does not localize to the cortex and spindle midzone but accumulates on spindle pole microtubules to which actin is recruited. This leads either to failure of the cleavage furrow to form or later defects in which daughter cells remain connected by a microtubule bridge. Together, this suggests Pav-KLP transports elements of the actomyosin cytoskeleton to plus ends of astral microtubules in the equatorial region of the cell to permit cleavage ring formation...|$|R
40|$|High {{specific}} activity tritiated thymidine (50 - 3 Ci/mM and 56 Ci/mM) and autoradiographic techniques {{were used to}} study cell renewal in the gill epithelium of the freshwater mussel, Margaritifera margaritifera. The cell renewal system in the gill epithelium of M. margaritifera appears to consist of a stem-type population in the gill furrow and gill <b>furrow</b> <b>edges</b> which supplies, through division, cells for a maturing, dividing transient transitional population along the proximal gill ridge sides which, in turn, supplies cells to a simple transient, differentiated, functional population on the distal gill ridge sides and tip. Loss of cells from the cell renewal system appears to be through cell death and/or extrusion from the gill ridge tip. No emigration or immigration of labelled nuclei out of, or into, the gill epithelium was observed. The minimum transit time from the dividing transient population to the functional population in the gill ridge tip may {{be no more than}} 24 h. We were unable to detect any radiobiological effects or the presence of cytoplasmic labelling due to the use of high specific activities. However, such possibilities cannot be eliminated from consideration in further studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{basic body}} plan {{of a number}} of {{vertebrates}} results from two processes that occur early {{in the development of the}} blastoderm: large scale rearrangements of tissue via a process called gastrulation, and axial subdivision of tissue in a process called somitogenesis. The £rst step of gas-trulation in avians is formation of the primitive streak, which marks the £rst clear manifestation of the anterior-posterior axis. Cell movements that occur through the streak ultimately convert the single layered-blastoderm into a trilaminar blastoderm comprising prospective endodermal, mesodermal and ectodermal tissue. During streak formation a group of cells moves anteriorly as a coherent column from the posterior end of the blastoderm, and as it proceeds other cells stream over the lateral <b>edges</b> of the <b>furrow</b> left behind. The anterior end of the streak is a specialized structure called Hensen’s node, which serves as an organizing center for later axis formation and determination of the left-right asymmetry of the body.

The posterior end of the segmental plate moves down the cranio-caudal axis with the node, as more cells are added to it by cell division within the plate and by cells entering from the primitive streak.

Beyond the furrow of the border, a sea of hatred and desire for revenge is swelling, awaiting the day when serenity will dull our path, for the day when we will heed the ambassadors of malevolent hypocrisy who call upon us to lay down our arms.

Radioiodinated membrane proteins and surface-attached carbon particles, which lie in the path of the future furrow, contract toward the animal pole in the initial stages of cleavage while markers in other regions do not. We suggest that the domain of heavily labeled membrane at the leading edge of the definitive furrow contains the labeled elements that are gathered at the animal pole during the initial surface contraction and that they include membrane anchors for the underlying contractile ring of microfilaments...|$|R

6000|$|It is not, however, {{so much in}} the {{selection}} of single incidents of this kind as in the feeling which regulates the arrangement of the whole subject that the mind of a great composer is known. A single incident may be suggested by a felicitous chance, as a pretty motto might be for the heading of a chapter. But the great composers so arrange all their designs that one incident illustrates another, just as one colour relieves another. Perhaps the [...] "Heysham," [...] of the Yorkshire series which, as to its locality, may be considered a companion to the last drawing we have spoken of, the [...] "Lancaster Sands," [...] presents as interesting an example as we could find of Turner's feeling in this respect. The subject is a simple north-country village, on the shore of Morecambe Bay; not in the common sense, a picturesque village: there are no pretty bow-windows, or red roofs, or rocky steps of entrance to the rustic doors, or quaint gables; nothing but a single street of thatched and chiefly clay-built cottages, ranged in a somewhat monotonous line, the roofs so green with moss that at first we hardly discern the houses from the fields and trees. The village street is closed at the end by a wooden gate, indicating the little traffic there is on the road through it, and giving it something the look of a large farmstead, in which a right of way lies through the yard. The road which leads to this gate is full of ruts, and winds down a bad bit of hill between two broken banks of moor ground, succeeding immediately to the few enclosures which surround the village; they can hardly be called gardens; but a decayed fragment or two of fencing fill the gaps in the bank; and a clothes-line, with some clothes on it, striped blue and red, and a smock-frock, is stretched between the trunks of some stunted willows; a very small haystack and pigstye being seen {{at the back of the}} cottage beyond. An empty, two-wheeled, lumbering cart, drawn by a pair of horses with huge wooden collars, the driver sitting lazily in the sun, sideways on the leader, is going slowly home along the rough road, it being about country dinner-time. At the end of the village there is a better house, with three chimneys and a dormer window in its roof, and the roof is of stone shingle instead of thatch, but very rough. This house is no doubt the clergyman's; there is some smoke from one of its chimneys, none from any other in the village; this smoke is from the lowest chimney at the back, evidently that of the kitchen, and it is rather thick, the fire not having been long lighted. A few hundred yards from the clergyman's house, nearer the shore, is the church, discernible from the cottage only by its low-arched belfry, a little neater than one would expect in such a village; perhaps lately built by the Puseyite incumbent;[265] and beyond the church, close to the sea, are two fragments of a border war-tower, standing on their circular mound, worn on its brow deep into <b>edges</b> and <b>furrows</b> by the feet of the village children. On the bank of moor, which forms the foreground, are a few cows, the carter's dog barking at a vixenish one: the milkmaid is feeding another, a gentle white one, which turns its head to her, expectant of a handful of fresh hay, which she has brought for it in her blue apron, fastened up round her waist; she stands with her pail on her head, evidently the village coquette, for she has a neat bodice, and pretty striped petticoat under the blue apron, and red stockings. Nearer us, the cowherd, barefooted, stands on a piece of the limestone rock (for the ground is thistly and not pleasurable to bare feet);--whether boy or girl we are not sure; it may be a boy, with a girl's worn-out bonnet on, or a girl with a pair of ragged trowsers on; probably the first, as the old bonnet is evidently useful to keep the sun out of our eyes when we are looking for strayed cows among the moorland hollows, and helps us at present to watch (holding the bonnet's edge down) the quarrel of the vixenish cow with the dog, which, leaning on our long stick, we allow to proceed without any interference. A little to the right the hay is being got in, of which the milkmaid has just taken her apronful to the white cow; but the hay is very thin, and cannot well be raked up because of the rocks; we must glean it like corn, hence the smallness of our stack behind the willows, and a woman is pressing a bundle of it hard together, kneeling against the rock's edge, to carry it safely to the hay-cart without dropping any. Beyond the village is a rocky hill, deep set with brushwood, a square crag or two of limestone emerging here and there, with pleasant turf on their brows, heaved in russet and mossy mounds against the sky, which, clear and calm, and as golden as the moss, stretches down behind it towards the sea. A single cottage just shows its roof over the edge of the hill, looking seaward; perhaps one of the village shepherds is a sea captain now, and may have built it there, that his mother may first see the sails of his ship whenever it runs into the bay. Then under the hill, and beyond the border tower, is the blue sea itself, the waves flowing in over the sand in long curved lines, slowly; shadows of cloud and gleams of shallow water on white sand alternating--miles away; but no sail is visible, not one fisherboat on the beach, not one dark speck on the quiet horizon. Beyond all are the Cumberland mountains, clear in the sun, with rosy light on all their crags.|$|R
