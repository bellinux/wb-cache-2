5|$|The Narragansett was {{possibly}} an ambling horse, {{rather than a}} true pacing breed. It {{was known as a}} sure-footed, <b>dependable</b> breed, although not flashy or always good-looking. Pacers were used for racing and general riding. They were frequently crossed with other breeds, and provided the foundation for several other American breeds, including the American Saddlebred, Standardbred and Tennessee Walking Horse.|$|E
5|$|Though coral {{have large}} sexually-reproducing populations, their {{evolution}} can be slowed by abundant asexual reproduction. Gene flow is variable among coral species. According to the biogeography of coral species gene flow cannot {{be counted on}} as a <b>dependable</b> source of adaptation as they are very stationary organisms. Also, coral longevity might factor into their adaptivity.|$|E
5|$|A {{tall and}} thin off spinner, Trumble {{delivered}} the ball at a quicker pace than most spin bowlers, using his height and uncommonly long fingers to his greatest advantage. He was at his best on the softer pitches of England, but his accuracy and variations in pace enabled him to take wickets on the harder pitches of Australia. He was a <b>dependable</b> lower order batsman and a fine fielder in the slips. He was recognised as a shrewd thinker about the game and was popular with team-mates and opponents, {{with a penchant for}} practical jokes.|$|E
5|$|After the defeats at {{the battles}} at Ostrach and Stockach, and the Army of the Danube's retreat into the Black Forest, the French Directory had sacked Jean Baptiste Jourdan in April 1799 and given command {{of both the}} Army of Switzerland and the Army of the Danube to André Masséna. Protecting the {{northern}} access to Zürich, Masséna gathered {{some of the best}} commanders he had available; eventually, three of them would become Marshals of France, and Tharreau, a <b>dependable</b> General of Division.|$|E
5|$|Aldridge was a <b>dependable</b> {{second or}} third starter {{throughout}} most of his career. He {{was known for his}} curveball and pinpoint accuracy. Aldridge batted and threw right-handed. He began his pro career by signing a contract with Indianapolis of the American Association in 1915, but first played for Denver of the Western League and then Erie of the Central League. He played for Indianapolis in 1916 where he was scouted for the Chicago Cubs. He was sold to the Cubs on August 28, 1916.|$|E
5|$|If the hastati {{failed to}} break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break through, they would retire behind the heavy triarii spearmen who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routing enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line {{were some of the}} least <b>dependable</b> troops, and were used in a support role, {{providing}} mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line.|$|E
5|$|Like many burgeoning {{cities of}} its day, Pittsburgh's growth outstripped {{some of its}} {{necessary}} infrastructure, such as a water supply with <b>dependable</b> pressure. Because of this, on April 10, 1845, a great fire burned out of control, destroying over a thousand buildings and causing $9M in damages. As the city rebuilt, the age of rails arrived. In 1851, the Ohio and Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Cleveland and Allegheny City (present-day North Side). In 1854, the Pennsylvania Railroad began service between Pittsburgh and Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|A trade {{route is}} a {{logistical}} network {{identified as a}} series of pathways and stoppages used for the commercial transport of cargo. The term {{can also be used to}} refer to trade over bodies of water. Allowing goods to reach distant markets, a single trade route contains long distance arteries, which may further be connected to smaller networks of commercial and noncommercial transportation routes. Among notable trade routes was the Amber Road, which served as a <b>dependable</b> network for long-distance trade. Maritime trade along the Spice Route became prominent during the Middle Ages, when nations resorted to military means for control of this influential route. During the Middle Ages, organizations such as the Hanseatic League, aimed at protecting interests of the merchants, and trade became increasingly prominent.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} the Greens were separated, Debora met Michael Farrar, {{a student in}} his twenties {{completing}} his last year of medical school. Farrar was struck by Green's intelligence and vitality, though he was embarrassed by her habit of explosively losing her temper at minor slights. In contrast, Green felt that Farrar was a stable, <b>dependable</b> presence. The couple were married on May 26, 1979. When Farrar was accepted for an internal medicine residency at the University of Cincinnati, the couple moved to Ohio. Green went into practice at Jewish Hospital as an emergency physician, but grew dissatisfied and eventually switched specialties. She began a second residency in internal medicine, joining Farrar's program.|$|E
5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely <b>dependable</b> source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the past several decades, coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Germany's {{foreign policy}} {{during the war}} {{involved}} the creation of allied governments under direct or indirect control from Berlin. A main goal was obtaining soldiers from the senior allies such as Italy and Hungary and millions of workers and ample food supplies from subservient allies such as Vichy France. By the fall of 1942, there were 24 divisions from Romania on the Eastern Front, 10 from Italy and 10 from Hungary. When a country was no longer <b>dependable,</b> Germany assumed full control as it did with France in 1942, Italy in 1943 and Hungary in 1944. Although Japan was an official powerful ally, the relationship was distant and there was little co-ordination or co-operation. For example, Germany refused to share their formula for synthetic oil from coal {{until late in the}} war.|$|E
5|$|Since 2010, {{ridership}} on the G {{has risen}} 17%, with approximately 150,000 riders per weekday in 2015. It is the route with {{the fastest growing}} ridership base in the entire system. These improvements will also have the side benefit {{of being able to}} accommodate the growing ridership base in gentrified neighborhoods along the G, like Park Slope, Carroll Gardens, Bedford-Stuyvesant, Williamsburg, Greenpoint, and Long Island City. This is due in part because the G weekday frequencies have become more <b>dependable</b> {{as a result of its}} 2013 review. However, weekend service was still lacking, according to some riders.|$|E
5|$|The third column, {{commanded}} by the experienced Maximilian Anton Karl, Count Baillet de Latour, included 11battalions and 2 regiments of cavalry. The fourth, {{commanded by}} the <b>dependable</b> Friedrich Joseph, Count of Nauendorf, included the entire vanguard of Charles' corps and approached {{on the far}} Austrian left. The two larger columns, under Latour and Nauendorf, were to attack the French right wing in force, and to turn {{it so that the}} French army's back was to the Rhine. This was by far the most grueling of the proposed advances: they would approach the French uphill from them. Nauendorf divided his column into several smaller groups, and approached Kandern from several sides, up the steep slopes, by coordinating contact between his column and Latour's, using Maximilian, Count of Merveldt's regiment as the link between them.|$|E
5|$|In May 2011, the Ministry of Transport {{announced}} that SKA-Somalia had been contracted to manage {{operations at the}} re-opened Aden Adde International Airport {{over a period of}} ten years. Among its first initiatives, worth an estimated $6 million, SKA invested in new airport equipment and expanded support services by hiring, training and equipping 200 local workers to meet international airport standards. The company also assisted in comprehensive infrastructure renovations, restored a <b>dependable</b> supply of electricity, revamped the baggage handling facilities as well as the arrival and departure lounges, put into place electronic check-in systems, and firmed up on security and work-flow. Additionally, SKA connected the grounds' Somali Civil Aviation and Meteorological Agency (SCAMA) and immigration, customs, commercial airlines and Somali Police Force officials to the internet. By January 2013, the firm had introduced shuttle buses to ferry travelers to and from the passenger terminal.|$|E
5|$|In {{this type}} of legion, the 900 hastati formed 15 maniples, {{military}} units of 60 men each. Attached to each maniple were about 20 leves, javelin-armed light infantry. The hastati stood in the first battle line, {{in front of the}} principes of the second line and the triarii of the third. In a pitched battle, the leves would form up {{at the front of the}} legion and harass the enemy with their javelins to cover the advance of the hastati. If the hastati failed to break the enemy during their engagement, they would fall back and let the heavier principes take over. If the principes could not break them, they would retire behind the triarii spearmen, who would then engage the enemy in turn. The equites, cavalrymen, were used as flankers and to pursue routed enemies. The rorarii and accensi in the final battle line were some of the least <b>dependable</b> troops, and were used in a support role, providing mass and reinforcing wavering areas of the line.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{hourglass}} {{was one of}} the few reliable {{methods of}} measuring time at sea, it is speculated that it was used on board ships as far back as the 11th century, when it would have complemented the magnetic compass as an aid to navigation. However, the earliest unambiguous evidence of their use appears in the painting Allegory of Good Government, by Ambrogio Lorenzetti, from 1338. From the 15th century onwards, hourglasses were used in a wide range of applications at sea, in churches, in industry, and in cooking; they were the first <b>dependable,</b> reusable, reasonably accurate, and easily constructed time-measurement devices. The hourglass also took on symbolic meanings, such as that of death, temperance, opportunity, and Father Time, usually represented as a bearded, old man. Though also used in China, the hourglass's history there is unknown. The Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan used 18 hourglasses on each ship during his circumnavigation of the globe in 1522.|$|E
5|$|Since their {{invention}} in 1900, reflector sights {{have come}} to be used as gun sights on all kinds of weapons. They were used on fighter aircraft, in a limited capacity in World War I, widely used in World War II, and still used as the base component in many types of modern head-up displays. They have been used in other types of (usually large) weapons as well, such as anti-aircraft gun sights, anti tank gun sights, and any other role where the operator had to engage fast moving targets over a wide field of view, and the sight itself could be supplied with sufficient electrical power to function. There was some limited use of the sight on small arms after World War II but it came into widespread use after the late 1970s with the invention of the red dot sight, with a red light-emitting diode (LED) as its reticle, making a <b>dependable</b> sight with durability and extremely long illumination run time.|$|E
5|$|The early stories present Valérian as {{a typical}} square-jawed hero figure, who is strong and <b>dependable</b> (although an early running joke was that despite being a time-traveller he is always running late, {{especially}} when summoned by his boss). However, as the series progresses, he is increasingly portrayed as somewhat knuckle-headed. In World Without Stars (Le Pays sans étoile), he gets recklessly drunk on the colonists' home-made booze, in On the False Earths (Sur les terres truquées), the historian, Jadna, views him as useful only as cannon fodder and nothing else while in Heroes of the Equinox (Les Héros de l'Equinoxe), he comes across as woefully inadequate compared with the champions he is competing against. Although devoted to Laureline, he has been led astray by other women, such as in Heroes of the Equinox and Brooklyn Station, Terminus Cosmos.|$|E
5|$|The {{protagonist of}} Angel Beats! Track Zero, Hinata is a bright, <b>dependable</b> {{guy who is}} the closest to Otonashi. He always tries to save his friends if he can and is a {{reliable}} force in the team. He and Yui constantly irritate one another on a daily basis, but deep down, he cares for Yui, as shown when he helps her pass on by telling her he would marry her. He is a talented baseball player, and his regret in life was his failure to catch a baseball, which cost his team an important baseball game. He nicknamed Yuri as Yurippe when they co-founded the SSS as {{he did not feel}} comfortable calling her Yuri, because his mother has the same name. He has shown romantic feelings towards Yuri in Track Zero, although he finds himself getting attracted to Yui much later in the series. He died from getting hit by a truck. He uses an RPK-74 and an S 645.|$|E
5|$|West Indies toured Pakistan in late 1990, and Ambrose {{topped the}} team's bowling averages in a three-match series which was drawn 1–1. He took 14 wickets at 17.07, but was overshadowed {{slightly}} by {{the performances of}} Ian Bishop. He played the first two ODIs, but missed the third after Pakistan had already won the series, and his best figures in the Tests came in the final match when he took five for 35. Then, when Australia toured West Indies from February 1991, Ambrose took 18 wickets in the five Tests {{at an average of}} 27.38. West Indies won the series 2–1, and Ambrose was fourth in the averages, but Tony Cozier observed in Wisden that the whole West Indies attack was <b>dependable.</b> Ambrose made an impression batting as part of a West Indian lower batting order which repeatedly added crucial runs during the series. He took part in two important partnerships to help his team recover from a difficult situation, and in the third match, he scored his only half-century in Tests. He also took 20 first-class wickets for Leeward Islands.|$|E
5|$|With {{the growth}} of {{scholarly}} criticism in the 17th and 18th centuries, fewer historians believed Philip to be a Christian. Historians had become increasingly aware of secular texts, which did not describe Philip as a Christianand which, indeed, recorded him participating as pontifex maximus (chief priest) over the millennial Secular Games in 248. Modern scholars are divided on the issue. Some, like Hans Pohlsander and Ernst Stein, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are ambiguous, based on oral rumor, and do not vouch for a Christian Philip; others, like John York, Irfan Shahîd, and Warwick Ball, argue that the ecclesiastic narratives are clear and <b>dependable</b> enough that Philip {{can be described as}} a Christian; still others, like Glen Bowersock, argue that the sources are strong enough to describe Philip as a man interested in and sympathetic to Christianity, but not strong enough to call him a Christian.|$|E
5|$|Jardine {{played a}} full season of cricket in 1931. In June, he was {{appointed}} as captain for the Test against New Zealand (two more Tests were later added). The English selectors were searching for possible captains for the 1932–33 tour of Australia, with Bradman and Australia's strong batting line up foremost in their minds. Christopher Douglas believes that, as Jardine was not a regular county captain, the selectors wanted to assess his leadership ability but had probably not settled on him as a final choice. He was also chosen as a <b>dependable,</b> proven batsman. While Percy Fender approved of his appointment, The Times correspondent believed that he was unproven and others were more deserving of the leadership. Ian Peebles, writing 40 years later, claimed that Jardine's appointment was popular but cricket administrators had misgivings. Alan Gibson believed that Jardine was chosen because the other candidates were either not worth {{their place in the}} side, too old or had controversy attached to them. Furthermore, Jardine impressed the chairman of selectors, Pelham Warner, who stated that he was very effective in selection meetings through his knowledge of cricket history and went into great detail to choose the correct players; it seems that Warner was the driving force behind Jardine's appointment.|$|E
