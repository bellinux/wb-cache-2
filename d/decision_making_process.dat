Thus, analysis of organizational behaviors in the <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> has been attracting increasing attention since the 1950 s. Now studies on institutional structure of the <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> are on {{a new line of}} research projects in the System and Decision Sciences Area of IIASA.

This paper is modestly concerned with providing some basic ideas for this direction, especially for multiobjective extension of preference theory in organizational analysis.

25|$|In May 2010 and December 2010, {{soldiers}} of the 560th worked specifically with the Ugandan army {{to set up a}} military <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>process</b> (MDMP) training event. The idea was to familiarize the Ugandans with U.S. Army Light Infantry MDMP at the tactical battalion level. Uganda’s military is highly interested in understanding how the American Army conducts the MDMP based on their operational lessons learned in both the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Somalia. The seminar assisted the process by establishing a basic understanding of roles and responsibilities of a light infantry battalion staff in the MDMP process, MDMP timelines and sequence of events, products or deliverables, and an understanding of how this product aids the field commander. This, in turn, set the foundation for a follow-on MDMP, which will familiarize the Ugandan army with the light infantry <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>process</b> at the brigade level. Such training events also help the U.S. by enhancing awareness in the U.S. military of Ugandan infantry battalion practices, thereby improving interoperability. They also elicit lessons learned from the audience’s peacekeeping operations.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to improve our {{understanding}} of the underlying policy-making processes, conflicts and contradictions in agricultural biotechnology in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). It examines the nature of relationships that emerge in policy <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> and how these indicate some potential for institutional change. The emergence of biotechnology ‘champions’ is highlighted as a peculiarity of SSA and analysed within <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> to understand why biotechnology regulations appear to invariably take a particular shape. The analysis demonstrates how the relationships that form in practice within <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> influence the attainment of social imperatives. Effective public participation in biotechnology <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes</b> is important. However, this does not in any way imply that the representation of public concerns will automatically influence the outcome of <b>decision</b> <b>making</b> <b>processes,</b> and importantly stamp out socio-economic challenges.
