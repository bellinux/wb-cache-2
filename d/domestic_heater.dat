40|$|AbstractFirewood {{production}} is often {{considered to be}} CO 2 –neutral, if the carbon dioxide emitted by burning the wood is absorbed by replacement trees. However, burning firewood in the <b>domestic</b> <b>heaters</b> that are currently available in Australia produces methane and black carbon particles that increase global warming. The {{aim of this study}} was to estimate the amount of global warming from wood heating in Australia and evaluate ways in which this might be reduced. Methane from the average wood heater in Brisbane, Perth or Sydney is estimated to cause at least as much global warming as gas central heating an entire house with floor area of 160 m 2. In the colder climates of Canberra and Melbourne, a wood heater in the living area plus supplementary heating in other rooms is also estimated to cause more global warming than gas, or reverse cycle air–conditioning. Australia’s annual contribution to global warming would be reduced by at least 8. 7 million tonnes of CO 2 –equivalent (the same as removing about 21 % of Australian passenger cars from the roads, or generating electricity from 5. 8 million household 1 kW rooftop photovoltaic systems) if the 4. 5 to 5 million tonnes of firewood currently burned in <b>domestic</b> wood <b>heaters</b> were instead used to replace coal in power stations and <b>domestic</b> wood <b>heaters</b> replaced by gas or reverse cycle air–conditioning. Replacement with pellet heaters would also reduce global warming and the health cost of PM 2. 5 emissions, estimated to exceed $ 3 800 per wood heater per year. However, even greater reductions could be achieved if <b>domestic</b> wood <b>heaters</b> were replaced by innovative developments such as solar air heaters or local combined heat and power units that burn cleanly with minimal methane emissions, providing electricity and hot water as well as domestic heating...|$|R

40|$|Water is {{the most}} {{desirable}} and sparse resource in Gulf cooperation council (GCC) region. Utilization of point-of-use (POU) water treatment devices has been gaining huge market recently due to increase in knowledge of urban population on health related issues over contaminants in decentralized water distribution networks. However, there is no foolproof way of knowing whether the treated water is free of contaminants harmful for drinking and hence reliance on certified bottled water has increased worldwide. The bottling process right from treatment to delivery is highly unsustainable due to huge energy demand along the supply chain. As a step towards sustainability, we investigated various ways of coupling of membrane distillation (MD) process with solar <b>domestic</b> <b>heaters</b> for co-production of domestic heat and pure water. Performance dynamics of various integration techniques have been evaluated and appropriate configuration has been identified for real scale application. A solar combi MD (SCMD) system is experimentally tested for single household application for production 20 L/day of pure water and 250 L/day of hot water simultaneously without any auxiliary heating device.

40|$|With {{the rapid}} growth of thermostatically {{controlled}} loads, active power fluctuation and peak demand growth within an autonomous micro-grid become serious problems. This paper tries to suppress power fluctuation and shave peak demand for a micro-grid through optimizing <b>domestic</b> electric water <b>heaters</b> (controllable load). In this paper, <b>domestic</b> electric water <b>heater</b> models are first built to optimize power flow within a single water heater. Subsequently, the Monte Carlo method is proposed to simulate power consumption of a cluster of <b>domestic</b> electric water <b>heaters.</b> After that, the temperature state priority list method is presented to suppress power flow and shave peak demand for a given micro-grid. Optimization results show that the proposed temperature state priority list method can reduce peak demand by 12. 5 %. However, it has a wider active power fluctuation range and needs a longer reaction time compared with the simplified temperature state priority list method. In addition, the optimization results show that by increasing the number of controllable loads participating in load scheduling, active power fluctuation can be reduced and the maximum active power of the given micro-grid can be cut. However, to achieve this, about 1. 2 % of extra electrical energy needs to be generated by the external grid...|$|R

40|$|In {{the past}} decade {{there has been a}} {{significant}} increase in the use of <b>domestic</b> solar water <b>heaters.</b> Whilst the range and quality of products on the market have increased to meet this demand, flat plate solar collectors of the type used in many modern domestic hot water systems have not changed significantly in the past twenty years. These types of absorbers typically have high heat losses and low efficiency, particular throughout winter months. A novel type of solar collector has been proposed which addresses a number of issues including heat loss characteristics and seasonal performance. The project is investigating both design and production aspects of the new collector to provide an optimised design for an advanced <b>domestic</b> solar water <b>heater.</b> An indoors experimental program has commenced and has shown that considerable reductions in the overall heat loss may be possible with the proposed design and further experimental work is being undertaken to confirm this. It is believed that further reductions can also be achieved by the introduction of convective suppression barriers on the underside of the upper leading edge of the double sided plate. Particle Imaging Velocimetry (PIV) will be used to visualise the flow inside the concentrator cavities and to experimentally determine the flow velocity profiles within the cavities. A computational fluid dynamics model has also been developed to assist in the design process. This model will be validated with experimental results. 1.

5000|$|Though {{not very}} popular in North America, another type of water heater {{developed}} in Europe predated the storage model. In London, England, in 1868, a painter named Benjamin Waddy Maughan invented the first instantaneous <b>domestic</b> water <b>heater</b> that did not use solid fuel. Named the geyser after an Icelandic gushing hot spring, Maughan's invention made cold water at the top flow through pipes that were heated by hot gases from a burner at the bottom. Hot water then flowed into a sink or tub. The invention was somewhat dangerous {{because there was no}} flue to remove heated gases from the bathroom. A water heater is still sometimes called a geyser in the UK.|$|R

40|$|A 76 mm outlet {{diameter}} radial swirler with 8 mm vane depth {{was investigated in}} a 140 mm combustor diameter condensing 20 kW ultra-low NOx boiler. The aim was to show that small turbulent flames could achieve compact ultra-low NOx water heating. Low NOx was achieved using lean well mixed low flame temperature combustion with a 0. 7 equivalence ratio (Ø). Thermal NOx formation was also minimised by cooling the flame downstream of the swirler outlet. A water cooled heat transfer coil was traversed into the flame to determine how close to the swirler exit the heat transfer could occur, without a major increase in the combustion inefficiency. This was shown to be 70 mm from the radial swirler throat outlet. Rapid fuel and air mixing was achieved using fuel injection through {{the wall of the}} 76 mm swirler outlet throat, assisted by a 41 mm diameter outlet orifice at the exit of the 76 mm internal diameter wall fuel injector. This created swirling flow with higher axial velocities and a more concentrated high turbulence region downstream of the orifice outlet. A 4 mb burner pressure loss was used, which is typical of domestic forced draught combustion systems. The air inlet temperature was 400 K, which is typical of reverse air flow cooled combustion chambers at <b>domestic</b> water <b>heater</b> conditions. The strong swirling flow interaction with the heat exchanger coil give an 89 % thermal efficiency with the front of the coil 70 mm from the swirler outlet. The emissions measurements showed that the combustion inefficiency was below 0. 1 %, the CO/CO 2 ratio < 0. 001 and the NOx emissions were 5 ppm at 0 % oxygen with the heat exchanger at 70 mm from the radial swirler outlet.

In a typical off-peak installation, a lower immersion heater is connected to the separately switched off-peak heating circuit and an upper heater is connected to the normal circuit via its own switch. The consumer then has the option to top up the available hot water supply at any time, rather than waiting for the cheaper supply to turn on (typically after midnight). A poorly insulated hot water cylinder will increase running costs because a consumer must pay for electricity used to replace lost heat.|$|R
