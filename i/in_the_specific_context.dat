The distribution of X conditional upon its parents may have any form. It is common to work with discrete or Gaussian distributions since that simplifies calculations. Sometimes only constraints on a distribution are known; one can then use the principle of maximum entropy to determine a single distribution, the one with the greatest entropy given the constraints.

2500|$|An {{important}} {{innovation in}} Proto-Germanic was {{the development of}} two separate sets of adjective endings, originally corresponding to a distinction between indefinite semantics ("a man") and definite semantics ("the man"). The endings of indefinite adjectives were derived {{from a combination of}} pronominal endings with one of the common vowel-stem adjective declensions – usually the o/ā class (often termed the a/ō class <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>context</b> of the Germanic languages) but sometimes the i or u classes. Definite adjectives, however, had endings based on n-stem nouns. [...] Originally both types of adjectives could be used by themselves, but already by Proto-Germanic times a pattern evolved whereby definite adjectives had to be accompanied by a determiner with definite semantics (e.g., a definite article, demonstrative pronoun, possessive pronoun, or the like), while indefinite adjectives were used in other circumstances (either accompanied by a word with indefinite semantics such as [...] "a", [...] "one", or [...] "some" [...] or unaccompanied).|$|E
2500|$|Young Earth creationists {{generally}} hold that, when Genesis {{describes the}} creation of the Earth occurring over a period of days, this indicates normal-length 24 hour days, and cannot reasonably be interpreted otherwise. They agree that the Hebrew word for [...] "day" [...] (yôm) can refer to either a 24-hour day or a long or unspecified time; but argue that, whenever the latter interpretation is used, it includes a preposition defining the long or unspecified period. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>context</b> of Genesis 1, since the days are both numbered and are referred to as [...] "evening and morning", this can mean only normal-length days. Further, they argue that the 24-hour day is the only interpretation that makes sense of the Sabbath command in Exodus 20:8–11. YECs argue that it is a glaring exegetical fallacy to take a meaning from one context (yom referring to {{a long period of time}} in Genesis 1) and apply it to a completely different one (yom referring to normal-length days in Exodus 20).|$|E

40|$|Sustainable {{management}} of the coastal zone represents a considerable challenge to Australian society. This challenge is rooted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complexity of the biophysical and sociocultural characteristics of coastal areas, including uncertainty about system characteristics and processes, and the diversity of stakeholders, their interests, values and perspectives, and <b>the</b> jurisdictions involved <b>in</b> coastal governance and management. Given this complexity of coastal zone management, scientific {{and other forms of}} knowledge can affect decision-making and human action in diverse ways, which will often depend on the ability of scientists to engage effectively with relevant stakeholders. In this chapter we describe a series of principles that we believe underpin the successful engagement and thus application of science in Australian coastal zone management. We suggest how these might be applied to a major science initiative for monitoring and modelling coastal processes, not through prescribing particular processes or engagement strategies but through reflection on what the principles might imply <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> initiative engages with stakeholders and decision-makers...|$|R

40|$|Earlier {{research}} that reports a correlational pattern between climate anomalies and violent conflict routinely refers to drought-induced agricultural shocks and adverse economic spillover effects {{as a key}} causal mechanism linking the two phenomena. Comparing {{half a century of}} statistics on climate variability, food production, and political violence across Sub-Saharan Africa, this study offers the most precise and theoretically consistent empirical assessment to date of the purported indirect relationship. The analysis reveals a robust link between weather patterns and food production where more rainfall generally is associated with higher yields. However, <b>the</b> second step <b>in</b> <b>the</b> causal model is not supported; agricultural output and violent conflict are only weakly and inconsistently connected, even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>specific</b> <b>contexts</b> where production shocks are believed to have particularly devastating social consequences. Although this null result could, in theory, be fully compatible with recent reports of food price-related riots, it suggests that the wider socioeconomic and political context is much more important than drought and crop failures in explaining violent conflict in contemporary Africa.
