2500|$|Camm's {{priority}} {{was to provide}} the pilot with <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below {{the trailing edge of}} the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded hinged flap which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material.|$|E
5000|$|The high driving {{position}} and large glass area affords drivers with <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility,</b> while the rear lamps are mounted {{high up on}} the structure so other road users can see them more prominently. Doors are fitted with anti intrusion bars with child locks at the rear.|$|E
50|$|The HA set new {{standards}} in its day for lightweight, easy to operate controls, a slick short gearchange, lightweight steering and clutch pedal, <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and relatively nippy performance. It {{was one of}} the first cars to be actively marketed towards women, perhaps as a result of these perceived benefits for them.|$|E

50|$|The D2/12 was {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the earlier British Rail Class D2/7 but was of more modern appearance. The engine casing was lower, giving much better <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|R
50|$|The Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5 was a British biplane fighter aircraft. In {{spite of}} {{possessing}} a square-and-boxy appearance, {{it was an}} advanced aircraft for the era; amongst its features, the S.E.5 was the first aircraft to be equipped with a pilot-adjustable tail-plane and a steerable tailskid. The S.E.5 was composed of a wire-braced box girder structure while the wings were furnished with wooden spars and internal ribs. The fuselage was narrower than many contemporary aircraft, which provided the pilot with <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> The aircraft had considerable structural strength, which was credited with improving the type's crashworthiness and survivability. It could also withstand high-g manoeuvres and was relatively resistant to battle-damage.|$|E
50|$|Development of the {{aircraft}} began in 1938 at the Yokosuka Naval Air Technical Arsenal as a carrier-based dive bomber to replace the Aichi D3A. The aircraft was a single-engine, all-metal low-wing monoplane, with a wide-track retractable undercarriage and wing-mounted dive brakes. It had a crew of two: a pilot and a navigator/radio-operator/gunner, seated under a long, glazed canopy which provided <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> The pilot of bomber versions was provided with a telescopic bombsight. The aircraft was powered by an Aichi Atsuta liquid-cooled inverted V12 engine, a licensed copy of the German DB 601, rated at 895 kW (1,200 hp). The radiator was behind and below the three-blade propeller, as in the P-40 Warhawk.|$|E
50|$|The nest {{is often}} {{built in a}} {{roadside}} tree with <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> some 4 to 10 m off the ground. It is built by both birds out of the stems of various flowering plants such as cudweed (Gnaphalium) and (Filago), and thyme (Thymus), and lined with whisps of wool, hairs, roots and feathers. There are five to seven eggs in the clutch, usually bluish green blotched with greenish-brown. Sometimes the background colour is cream or buff with pinkish-brown blotches. Their average size is 26.1 x 18.2 mm. Incubation lasts about fifteen days and is chiefly done by the female though both parents take part. They both feed the young which are ready to leave the nest after about fourteen days. There is usually a single brood.|$|E

5000|$|Contemporary reports {{praised the}} <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and the {{commanding}} driving position while recording {{that it was}} necessary to lean forward a little to engage first and third gears due to the long travel distance of the gear lever. [...] The large 40 cm tall luggage compartment was also commended.|$|R
50|$|A {{pilothouse}} yacht is {{one where}} the design and layout allow the crew to keep a safe and effective watch without having to be on deck. There must be <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> from within the yacht's accommodation - somewhere for a crewmember to keep watch comfortably whilst fully protected from the elements.|$|R
5000|$|The Mondial name (French {{for world}} or global) {{originated}} from Ferrari's motor racing history [...] - [...] the 500 Mondial {{was a successful}} lightweight sports racer of the early 1950s which was named to celebrate Ferrari's consecutive Formula 1 World Championships in 1952 and 1953. The name was revived as Ferrari won the Formula 1 World Championships in 1975, 1976, 1977, and 1979. Conceived as a 'practical' Ferrari, the Mondial is a genuine long-distance four-seater, with sufficient rear head- and leg-room for children and smaller adults. It affords easy access via the long single doors, and has surprisingly <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> for a mid-engined car. The vehicle has a slightly higher roofline and greater all-round dimensions compared to its two-seater stable mates, resulting in a comparative weight penalty of around ten percent.|$|E
5000|$|The Hornet was {{designed}} {{with the possibility}} of naval service on carriers firmly in mind. To this end good low-speed handling was required, along with <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> for the pilot. The basic Hornet design excelled at meeting these requirements. Shortly after the first Hornet prototype flew, Specification N.5/44 was issued to de Havilland, covering the modification of the Hornet for naval service. The Heston Aircraft Company was contracted to carry out the conversion work on three early production F.1s. The work entailed altering the wings to incorporate folding mechanisms so that each outer wing panel, from the aileron/flap line outboard could be folded upwards and inwards at an angle. The hinges were part of the upper wing skin structure while the lower wing skins incorporated securing latches, and Lockheed hydraulic jacks were used to move the wing panels. Slotted flaps were introduced to improve low speed [...] "flaps down" [...] control.|$|E
50|$|The Aeronca high-wing formula used a {{welded steel}} tube {{fuselage}} covered with fabric, wooden wings covered with plywood and fabric braced by V-struts {{to the rear}} undercarriage attachment point on the lower fuselage. Tail surfaces were also built up with welded steel tubing covered with fabric. The fixed tail-wheel undercarriage, sprung with oleo struts and faired triangular side members hinged at the fuselage. A small tail-wheel on a spring steel leaf at the extreme rear of the fuselage completed the under-carriage. The engine is fitted conventionally in the nose and was either semi-cowled or fully cowled using sheet aluminium alloy, depending on model. Some civilian models had side-by-side seating in a well-glazed cabin under the wing centre-section, with entry through car style doors either side. A tandem seating arrangement was developed for training and military models with the rear seat mounted 9 in inches higher than the front to allow the instructor {{to use the same}} instruments as the trainee and improve forward view from the back seat. Tandem seat aircraft had extensively glazed cockpits to allow <b>good</b> <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|E

50|$|On 16 May 1942, the USAAF {{recommended}} {{the construction and}} testing of 25 XP-77s. The aircraft featured a single-engine, low-wing monoplane with mainly wood construction, equipped with tricycle landing gear, a Bell trademark that bestowed good ground handling. A sleek bubble canopy also provided <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> (except forward due to the extended nose); a key requirement for a fighter.|$|R

5000|$|Then, with tail trimmer set, {{throttle}} and mixture lever fully forward... and {{puffs of}} grey exhaust smoke soon clearing at maximum r.p.m. came the surprise! There was no sudden surge of acceleration, {{but with a}} thunderous roar from the exhausts just ahead {{on either side of}} the windscreen, only a steady increase in speed... In retrospect that first Hurricane sortie was a moment of elation, but also of relief. Apart from the new scale of speeds that the pilot had to adapt to, the Hurricane had all the qualities of its stable, secure biplane predecessor the Hart, but enhanced by livelier controls, greater precision and all this performance.

50|$|The FL-23 {{prototype}} {{was designed}} and built as a private venture, it was a high-wing cantilever monoplane with an all-moving tailplane mounted {{at the top of}} the fin. It had a fixed tricycle landing gear and powered a 225-hp (168 kW) Continental E225 piston engine. It had room for a pilot and observer in tandem; the observer had an unusual acrylic plastic enclosure to give an <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b>|$|R

2500|$|A Mk VIII JF299 {{was used}} to {{experiment}} {{with the use of}} a new cut-back rear fuselage and a [...] "tear-drop" [...] canopy. This was intended to aid pilot visibility; many Spitfire pilots who were shot down were done so by enemies who approached in the aircraft's blind spot. In trials, the new hood design was found to bring about great improvements to <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and with several modifications, was standardised on later Spitfires.|$|R

25|$|There {{were also}} designs for pillbox-like {{structures}} for various purposes including light anti-aircraft positions, observation posts and searchlight positions {{to illuminate the}} shoreline. In addition, the Air Ministry provided designs of fortifications intended to protect airfields from troops landing or parachuting. These would {{not be expected to}} face heavy weapons so that the degree of protection was less and there was more emphasis on <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> and sweeping fields of fire. Many of these were later reinforced.|$|R

5000|$|The last {{development}} of this aircraft was the D.3803, with [...] Saurer YS-3 engine, and modified dorsal fuselage (with an <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility</b> canopy). The D.3803 was armed with three HS-404 20 mm cannon (one in the nose, two in the wings), plus up to 200 kg bombs and rockets. Despite not having a powerful engine, the type reached 680 km/h at 7000 m. The performance was impressive, but the last {{development of}} this 1935 fighter design had several shortcomings and was not entirely successful. Its development was halted as P-51D Mustangs became available.|$|R
5000|$|Tall by {{contemporary}} standards, the K70 {{benefited from the}} space saving characteristics of its front wheel drive layout and compact engine installation. The boxy cabin was unusually spacious and the luggage capacity class leading. The driver sat slightly higher than in competitor vehicles and the large window area conferred above average <b>all-round</b> <b>visibility.</b> [...] The relatively large glass area also led to the car carrying an above average proportion of its weight above waist height, however, rendering a wide track particularly important {{in order to ensure}} lateral stability.|$|R
