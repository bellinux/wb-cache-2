5|$|Mallory's {{nomination}} as Secretary of the Navy {{was submitted}} to the Provisional Congress {{as soon as the}} act establishing a navy was passed. Despite his evident qualifications, it drew significant opposition; <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> cited the Fort Pickens incident as evidence that he was not strongly pro-secession. Ultimately, however, he was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work that would prove <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> wrong. The result was The Destroying Angel and Daemons of Evil Interrupting the Orgies of the Vicious and Intemperate.|$|E
5|$|After Louise's death, {{and after}} bearing {{criticism}} of his war record from other Confederates for decades, Longstreet refuted most of their arguments in his memoirs entitled From Manassas to Appomattox, a labor of five years that was published in 1896. His final years were marked by poor health and partial deafness. In 1902 he suffered from severe rheumatism {{and was unable to}} stand {{for more than a few}} minutes at a time. His weight diminished from 200 to 135 pounds by January 1903. Cancer developed in his right eye, and in December he had X-ray therapy in Chicago to treat it. He contracted pneumonia and died in Gainesville on January 2, 1904, six days before his 83rd birthday. Longstreet's remains are buried in Alta Vista Cemetery. He outlived most of <b>his</b> <b>detractors,</b> and was one of only a few general officers from the Civil War to live into the 20th century.|$|E
50|$|Bodin's {{views on}} {{witchcraft}} were {{taken up in}} England by the witch-hunter Brian Darcy in the early 1580s, who argued for burning rather than hanging {{as a method of}} execution, and followed some of Bodin's suggestions in interrogating Ursula Kemp. They were also radically opposed by Reginald Scott in his sceptical work Discoverie of Witchcraft (1584). Later Francis Hutchinson was <b>his</b> <b>detractor,</b> criticising <b>his</b> methodology.|$|R

6000|$|The [...] "dam Siwash" [...] {{proved to}} be more {{reliable}} than <b>his</b> white <b>detractor.</b> <b>His</b> horses turned out to be gentle and strong, and we made a bargain without noise. At last it seemed {{we might be able to}} get away. [...] "To-morrow morning," [...] said I to Burton, [...] "if nothing further intervenes, we hit the trail a resounding whack." ...|$|R
5|$|Barton pursued {{his dreams}} of {{becoming}} a professional footballer by joining Everton's youth system, but played for Liverpool when he was 14. He underwent trials at Nottingham Forest, but was rejected when it was decided he {{was too small to}} become a footballer. Barton said his rejection by clubs only made him more determined to succeed as a footballer and prove <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> wrong. He made his first appearance for Manchester City's under-17s team in 1999 and played regularly at Academy level for three years. His first reserve team appearance came {{at the end of the}} 2000–01 season, in his final year as a trainee. Uncertain about Barton's future prospects, the club planned to release him, but reconsidered and gave him his first professional contract in the close season. Over the next two years, he successfully made the transition from the under-19s to regular reserve football. He was promoted to the first-team squad in the 2002–03 season.|$|E
5|$|Las Casas {{worked there}} in adverse {{conditions}} for the following months, being constantly harassed by the Spanish pearl fishers of Cubagua island who traded slaves for alcohol with the natives. Early in 1522 Las Casas left the settlement to complain to the authorities. While he was gone the native Caribs attacked the settlement of Cumaná, burned {{it to the ground}} and killed four of Las Casas's men. He returned to Hispaniola in January 1522, and heard the news of the massacre. The rumours even included him among the dead. To make matters worse, <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> used the event as evidence of the need to pacify the Indians using military means. The tragic outcome of Las Casas's great mainland adventure made him turn his life in a new direction.|$|E
5|$|The American {{official}} most {{associated with}} the conflict in Laos was Ambassador William H. Sullivan, who served from December 1964 until June 1969. He {{was also one of}} the most controversial. Considered brilliant by most and tyrannical by many, Sullivan was despised by the American high command (both Army and Air Force) in Saigon, Sullivan's demand that he alone maintain complete control over every aspect of American military operations in Laos and the stringent restrictions that he imposed upon those operations, earned him few friends among the military. Few of <b>his</b> <b>detractors,</b> however, considered the difficulties of the ambassador's position. He had to balance the competing interests of the CIA, the Seventh Air Force, MACV, and the Thais, and this had to be done without alienating Souvanna Phouma, an ally in all but name who acquiesced to almost every U.S. action within his country, short of outright invasion.|$|E
50|$|His month-long premiership was {{the subject}} of dispute between his supporter, Zhang Zuolin, and <b>his</b> <b>detractor,</b> Wu Peifu. When Wu forced his {{resignation}} on January 25, 1922, it caused the First Zhili-Fengtian War. Liang was fortunate to avoid the war himself in that he left Beijing under the excuse of illness as soon as he resigned. The Northern Expedition forced him to flee once again to Hong Kong in 1928, then he shuttled between Shanghai and Hong Kong for coping with the Japanese invaded Manchuria 1931, for tired of those, he died at Shanghai in 1933.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was known}} to friends as [...] "the Prof" [...] in {{reference}} to his position at the University of Oxford, and as [...] "Baron Berlin" [...] to <b>his</b> many <b>detractors</b> because of <b>his</b> German accent and haughty aristocratic manner.|$|R
5000|$|Marshall once bluntly {{described}} his legal philosophy as this: [...] "You {{do what you}} think is right and let the law catch up", a statement which <b>his</b> conservative <b>detractors</b> argued was a sign of his embracement of judicial activism.|$|R
5|$|Although the Duke {{was only}} an {{observer}} at Geertruidenberg, the failed negotiations gave credence to <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> that he was deliberately prolonging the war for his own profit. Yet it was with reluctance that he returned to campaigning in the spring, capturing Douai in June, before taking Béthune, and Saint-Venant, followed in November by Aire-sur-la-Lys. Nevertheless, support for the pro-war policy of the Whigs had, by this time, ebbed away. The Cabinet had long lacked cohesion and mutual trust (particularly following the Sacheverell affair) when in the summer the plan to break it up, prepared by Harley, was brought into action by the Queen. Sunderland was dismissed in June, followed by Godolphin (who had refused to sever his ties with Sarah) in August. Others followed. The result of the general election in October was a Tory landslide and {{a victory for the}} peace policy. Marlborough remained {{at the head of the}} army, however. The defeated Junto, the Dutch, Eugene and the Emperor, implored him to stand by the common cause, while the new ministers, knowing they had to fight another campaign, required him to maintain the pressure on the enemy until they had made their own arrangements for the peace.|$|E
5|$|Conwell {{arrived in}} Philadelphia on December 2, 1820. The trusteeism dispute had only grown more bitter during the vacancy that preceded Conwell's arrival. Shortly before Conwell reached the diocese, a priest, William Hogan, {{approached}} de Barth (then administering the diocese until a bishop was appointed) about securing an assignment to preach in Philadelphia. After only a cursory investigation of his past, de Barth agreed, and Hogan {{was assigned to}} St. Mary's Church. Hogan quickly ingratiated himself with the laymen who made up the board of trustees, siding with them in their dispute with the other clergy. Hogan's other behavior created tension between him and Conwell. When Conwell arrived, Hogan had already {{moved out of the}} priests' residence at Old St. Joseph's Church to a house across the street, claiming that the original accommodations were poor; <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> said he used the private residence to entertain women. The situation became public when Hogan announced from the pulpit one Sunday that neither Conwell nor anyone else had the right to say where he should live.|$|E
5|$|After {{receiving}} the nomination, Kemp became the ticket's spokesman for minorities and the inner-city. Due to {{agreement on the}} self-help policy that Louis Farrakhan has endorsed in many fora including the Million Man March, Kemp in a sense aligned himself with Farrakhan. However, Farrakhan was perceived as being anti-Semitic, and Kemp was considered an ally of Republican Jews. This issue necessitated some political sidestepping. As the nominee, Kemp at times overshadowed Dole. In fact, more than once, Kemp was described {{as if he was}} the Presidential nominee. In addition to having overshadowed Dole, despite the negative ad campaigns that the ticket used, Kemp was a very positive running mate who relied on a pep rally type of campaign tour full of football-related metaphors and hyperbole. Although some enjoyed Kemp's style, referring to him as the Good Shepherd, <b>his</b> <b>detractors,</b> such as U.S. News & World Report writer Steven V. Roberts, criticized the extensive use of recounting stories of passing balls relative to the use of recounting stories of passing bills. During the campaign, Kemp expressed the opinion that Republican Party leaders did not stand behind the ticket wholeheartedly. Despite Kemp's voice on minority issues, Colin Powell's support and polls that showed about 30% of blacks identified themselves as conservatives on issues such as school prayer, school vouchers and criminal justice, the Republicans were unable to improve upon historical support levels from African-American voters.|$|E
50|$|Reilly {{responded to}} {{academic}} criticism by publishing a further work Cromwell Was Framed (Ireland 1649), {{in which he}} counters <b>his</b> academic <b>detractors</b> (Prof. John Morrill, Prof. Micheál ÓSiochrú, Dr. Jason McElligott and Dr. Pádraig Lenihan), by the inclusion of contemporary documents.|$|R
50|$|All {{qualitative}} judgments aside, even <b>his</b> greater <b>detractors</b> {{admit that}} with Euridice Peri managed to establish sound principles for operatic composition.The work establishes in opera the dual resource of aria and recitative, and it explores {{the use of}} solo, ensemble and choral singing.|$|R
25|$|In 384 BC, Camillus was {{consular}} tribune again. His {{office was}} troubled chiefly by the charismatic Marcus Manlius Capitolinus, who became <b>his</b> greatest <b>detractor</b> and around whom all plebeians had aggregated. While Capitolinus {{was said to}} have kingly dreams, he attacked Camillus with precisely such a king-like accusation. Nonetheless, Capitolinus was formally judged and executed.|$|R
5|$|The most bitter {{legal battle}} began in 1809. Evans sued Samuel Robinson—a miller near Baltimore who was using Evans's {{improvements}} {{without a license}} to produce a very modest amount of flour—for damages of $2,500. That sum was deemed unjustifiably high and harsh by many, and Evans's actions rallied the Baltimore community against him, and when the case was finally heard in 1812 many appeared {{in support of the}} defendant. Evans's detractors presented evidence and witnesses at the trial to press the argument that Evans did not truly invent much of what his patents protected. Although the hopper-boy was undoubtedly original, the use of bucket chains and Archimedean screws had been used since ancient times and Evans had only modified some of their features and adapted them for use in a milling context. A now retired Thomas Jefferson weighed into the debate in letters to both Evans and <b>his</b> <b>detractors,</b> questioning the philosophy of patent law and what truly defined 'invention' and 'machine' (and to some extent the validity of his claims) but ultimately defended the purpose of patent law, which was to incentivize innovation by rewarding inventors for their development and sharing of new technology. And Jefferson noted that though Evans's designs consisted of devices that had long existed beforehand, everyone had access to these and yet only Evans had thought to modify and use them in conjunction to build an automatic mill. Ultimately the jury found in favor of Evans, but it was a pyrrhic victory as Evans had put most of the milling community offside in the process, and ultimately reduced his claim against Robinson to $1,000. In response, prominent Evans critic Isaac McPherson, made submission to Congress {{in the wake of the}} trial entitled Memorial to the Congress of Sundry Citizens of the United States, Praying Relief from the Oppressive Operations of Oliver Evans' Patent, seeking to limit the compensation Evans could seek for his patent's use or for Congress to void it altogether. Although the Senate drafted a bill that would roll-back some of Evans's patent rights, it did not pass, and he continued to vigorously pursue his patent fees. It would not be until the Patent Act of 1836 that many of these issues, including what constituted originality in the context of a patent, would be addressed.|$|E
25|$|Because Milošević's {{supporters}} controlled half of {{the votes}} in the SFRY presidency, his critics charge that he undermined the Yugoslav federation. This, <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> argue, upset {{the balance of power}} in Yugoslavia and provoked separatism elsewhere in the federation.|$|E
25|$|In Buchwald's later years, <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> {{characterized}} the column as hackneyed, tiresome and not funny. When the Dallas Times Herald canceled it in 1989, the editors {{did not receive}} a single letter of protest. By contrast, when the paper cancelled the comic strip Zippy the Pinhead, so many readers complained that the editors were compelled to bring it back.|$|E
5000|$|Pentlands columns teemed with {{personal}} abuse, which grew especially bitter following McKeans victory over Simon Snyder in the 1805 gubernatorial election. An editorial on Christmas Day bashed Tarleton Bates and Henry Baldwin, associates of the Tree of Libertys nominal publisher Walter Forward, as [...] "despicable sycophants" [...] and [...] "two {{of the most}} abandoned political miscreants that ever disgraced the state." [...] Bates struck back at <b>his</b> <b>detractor</b> on the street, {{with two or three}} lashes of a cowhide whip. Pentland some time later issued a challenge to a duel, which Bates declined. In publishing his account of the affair in the Tree of Liberty, Bates gave offense to Thomas Stewart, a merchant who had carried Pentlands challenge to Bates. Stewart, after failing to receive an apology, challenged Bates, who fatefully accepted. In the duel Bates was killed on the second exchange of fire.|$|R
50|$|As {{the film}} opens, Giulio Andreotti gives an inner {{monologue}} observing {{how he has}} managed to survive his tumultuous political career while <b>his</b> various <b>detractors</b> have died. A montage shows the murders of various people connected to Andreotti, including journalist Mino Pecorelli, Carabinieri general Carlo Alberto Dalla Chiesa, bankers Michele Sindona and Roberto Calvi, and former prime minister Aldo Moro.|$|R
60|$|Such {{being the}} {{character}} of Mr. Townsend, {{it will not be}} thought surprising that he should have his warm admirers and <b>his</b> hot <b>detractors.</b> And they who were inclined to be among the latter were not slow to add up certain little disagreeable eccentricities among the list of his faults,--as young Fitzgerald had done in the matter of the dirty surplices.|$|R
25|$|His tenure faced budget shortfalls, tough {{economic}} times, and natural disasters such as hurricanes and floods. Easley received mixed reviews on {{his handling of}} fiscal problems in the state. His supporters claimed many of the budget shortfall situations were created before he even took office, during the Hunt administration, while <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> criticized his support of raising sales taxes multiple times {{to cover the cost}} of new state programs.|$|E
25|$|It is said by <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> {{that unlike}} many of his other close {{relatives}} whom he took great care to commemorate, he took no trouble to have Joan commemorated after her death, leading to the conviction among some that his (in every sense) monumental commemorative endeavours were entirely practical (in terms of securing his personal objectives) rather than sentimental (her connections being of no direct use to him after her death).|$|E
25|$|Known for his fierce independence, Buenaventura {{was often}} {{targeted}} for removal from public office throughout his six-year term. However, his shrewd handling of both <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> and supporters {{allowed him to}} accomplish key policy reforms {{at a time when}} political upheavals often derailed the country's economic progress. By the end of his term as central bank governor, he had managed to steer the financial system closer to global standards.|$|E
5000|$|Despite this, most of {{his ideas}} were {{implemented}} in 1958 when De Gaulle created the Fifth Republic and established a presidentialist system based around his RPF party. However, De Gaulle was pushed {{in the short term}} to decide in favour of Jean Moulin's proposal as he still struggled to show the Allies (Americans in particular) that he was not a dictator. Brossolette's ideas of a Resistance party raised many opponents' fears of a [...] "bonapartian" [...] drift, especially among fellow socialists in London among which Pierre Cot and Raymond Aron. This seemed to be confirmed to <b>his</b> <b>detractor's</b> eyes when Brossolette succeeded a bold blow against the Vichy regime by exfiltrating from France Charles Vallin, deputy leader of conservative PSF (Parti Social Français) that had surged as the main French party with over 30% at pre-war elections, but deemed proto-fascist by the left. Hence the French Fourth Republic eventually reverted to the Third Republic's pre-war parliamentarist system.|$|R

5000|$|Because {{of these}} serious consequences, Muslims have {{traditionally}} been reluctant to practice takfir, that is, to pronounce professed Muslims as unbelievers (even Muslims in violation of Islamic law). This prospect of fitna, or internal strife, between Qutbists and [...] "takfir-ed" [...] mainstream Muslims, was put to Qutb by prosecutors in the trial {{that led to his}} execution, and is still made by <b>his</b> Muslim <b>detractors.</b>|$|R
25|$|<b>His</b> <b>detractors</b> have {{focussed}} {{upon his}} statements in Shiva's Rainbow of how science {{in public policy}} is mostly theatre {{and how he was}} more of an actor than a scientist. Taylor admits freely that most of his work was as a lawyer - 'the ultimate actor', but argues that his record as a skilled and experienced policy analyst has been glossed over by those who are averse to his message on climate change.|$|E
25|$|Knowing {{there was}} a good chance he would be chosen in the first round, Randolph {{declared}} himself eligible for the 2008 NBA draft {{at the end of his}} freshman year at LSU. Some projected Randolph to go high in the year's draft because of his versatility and potential, while <b>his</b> <b>detractors</b> thought he might drop because of his thin frame and raw overall game. In either case, many believed Randolph could be the steal of the draft with his talent and tremendous potential.|$|E
25|$|Trujillo's rule {{brought the}} country {{a great deal of}} {{stability}} and prosperity throughout his 31-year reign. The price, however, was high—civil liberties were non-existent and human rights violations were routine. Due to the longevity of Trujillo's rule, a detached evaluation of his legacy is difficult. Supporters of Trujillo claim that he reorganized both the state and the economy, and left vast infrastructure to the country. <b>His</b> <b>detractors</b> point to the brutality of his rule, and also claim that much of the country's wealth wound {{up in the hands of}} his family or close associates.|$|E
60|$|Her {{fortunes}} {{were in a}} sense {{bound up}} with those of her brother-in-law. He had been most unaccountably kind to her of late, a kindness which <b>his</b> many <b>detractors</b> attributed either to an infatuation for his brother's widow, or to a desire to further irritate his uncle the Earl of Northallerton, who--a rigid Puritan himself--hated the play-actress and her connection with his own family.|$|R
60|$|Forlimpopoli {{surrendered}} a {{few days}} later to Yves d'Allègre, whom Cesare had sent thither, whilst in Forli, as soon as he had reduced the citadel, and before even attempting to repair the damage done, the duke set about establishing order and providing for the dispensation of justice, exerting to that end the rare administrative ability which not even <b>his</b> bitterest <b>detractors</b> have denied him.|$|R
50|$|The work concludes rather abruptly. Boccaccio, {{as he does}} in the {{introduction}} of the fourth day, defends <b>his</b> work against <b>detractors.</b> However, this time he does it in a humorous and sacrilegious way.|$|R
