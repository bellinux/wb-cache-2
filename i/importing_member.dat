5000|$|The {{mechanism}} for achieving {{this result is}} as follows. The exporting member state zero-rates the VAT. This means that the member state of the exporting merchant does not collect VAT on the sale, but still gives the exporting merchant a credit for the VAT paid on the purchase by the exporter (in practice this often means a cash refund). The <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> state [...] "reverse charges" [...] the VAT. This means that the importer is required to pay VAT to the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> state at its rate. In many cases a credit is immediately given for this as input VAT. The importer then charges VAT on resale in the normal way.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{estimates}} {{the impact of}} the tariff liberalization in four largest CARICOM countries (Barbados, Guyana, Jamaica, and Trinidad and Tobago) on their trade flows. I trace changes in the product-line imports from CARICOM and non-CARICOM countries against time and commodity-level variation in external tariffs. I find that in each country the reduction of the external tariff, which eroded preferences enjoyed by <b>member</b> <b>imports,</b> increased the ratio of imports from non-member countries to <b>imports</b> from <b>member</b> countries. In Trinidad and Tobago, the higher ratio was largely the result of non-member <b>imports</b> crowding out <b>member</b> <b>imports.</b> In the three other countries, the ratio increased mainly because of higher non-member imports; {{there is little evidence that}} tariff reductions had an impact on <b>member</b> <b>imports.</b> Findings suggest that in Trinidad and Tobago liberalization of the external tariff reversed some of the trade diversion effects of CARICOM. ...|$|R

30|$|The {{implementation}} of a Regional Trade Agreement (RTA) is normally accompanied with a rise in market competition levels, in domestic agricultural markets through increases in imports and in foreign agricultural markets through increases in exports. These effects are expected to induce adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity in the importing and exporting countries. This paper analyzes {{the implications of these}} adjustments in the context of Viner's (The Customs Union Issue. Carnegie Endowment for International Peace: New York, NY, 1950) conventional partial equilibrium framework with perfectly elastic foreign supply schedules faced by the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country. It also examines these implications in the context of Pomfret's (Review of World Economics, 122 (3): 439 - 465, 1986) extended partial equilibrium framework depicting upward-sloping foreign supply schedules for the <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> country. The analysis underscores important changes and redistributions through the RTA's initial benefits and losses, following the RTA-induced adjustments in agricultural technology and productivity. Some analytical considerations are also discussed in the context of vertical agricultural markets. Finally, an empirical investigation is carried out, revealing different implications of membership in the European Union (EU) and its predecessor, the European Economic Community (EEC), for productivity in the agricultural sector.|$|E
30|$|Alternatively, the {{formation}} of an RTA could lessen the incentives of domestic firms in the agricultural sector of <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> countries to implement technology and productivity upgrading policies. These implications could arguably occur since RTA-induced increases in imports would raise the market competition levels and, consequently, would lead to reductions in the price-to-cost margins. This situation could reduce the market share of domestic firms and the expected returns from technology and productivity upgrading investments, and from innovation activities in general (Aghion and Howitt, 1998; Funk, 2003; Ghazalian, 2012).|$|E

30|$|The seminal partial {{equilibrium}} {{framework of}} Viner (1950) indentifies the principal implications of RTAs through the trade creation {{and the trade}} diversion effects. The trade creation effect implies that the removal (or reduction) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs) between RTA member countries leads {{to an increase in}} international trade flows between them, displacing less efficient domestic production. This effect generates positive welfare implications for the <b>importing</b> RTA <b>member</b> country. The trade diversion effect implies that the regional trade preferences induce a diversion of trade from the more efficient RTA non-member country to the less efficient RTA member country. This effect results in negative welfare implications for the <b>importing</b> RTA <b>member</b> country.|$|R

30|$|Regional Trade Agreements (RTAs) {{represent}} a prominent {{feature of the}} current international trading system. For instance, the number of RTAs that {{have been reported to}} the World Trade Organization (WTO) exceeded 500 in 2012 (WTO, 2012). RTAs normally encompass reductions (or eliminations) of policy trade barriers (e.g., tariffs, non-tariff barriers) between member countries. Also, RTAs often bring about higher levels of business cooperation and trade facilitation measures (e.g., development of regional trade-enhancing infrastructure) between member countries that further promote intra-regional trade flows. RTAs are commonly associated with increases in intra-regional trade flows in agricultural productsa. Naturally, such increases in intra-regional trade would be accompanied with a rise in market competition levels, in domestic agricultural markets for producers in <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> countries and in foreign regional agricultural markets for producers in exporting member countries.|$|E
40|$|Standard theory {{says that}} a country's welfare is {{unaffected}} by being excluded from a small regional trade agreement. But for most products,"small"countries and regional trade agreements do have some measure of market power. Such market power can arise if (1) supply is geographically concentrated; (2) tastes differ; (3) there is product differentiation (such as quality); (4) transport costs are high; (5) the principal importing countries impose quantitative restrictions; and (6) there is hysterisis because of irreversible costs. The authors show, based on two case studies, that regional trade agreements among small countries may have negative welfare implications for outside countries. In the first case, they find that Argentina's cattle and beef exports to Peru fell when Peru formed a regional trade agreement (the Andean Pact) with various countries, including Colombia, and exporter of the same products. Argentina also lost because of the higher unit price it received on its exports to Peru. Interestingly, Venezuela's entry into the Andean Pact (that is, {{the formation of a}} larger bloc) seems to have resulted in a welfare gain for the outside country (Argentina). In the second case, rather than examine whether formation of the Central American Common Market (CACM) had a negative impact on outside countries (for which they lacked data), they examine the impact of the CACM's breakdown on member countries. Although the CACM has essentially been trade-diverting for manufactures, it seems to have been trade-creating for white maize, with both importing and exporting member countries gaining from the regional trade agreement. So, one would expect that a breakdown of the CACM, which resulted in member countries becoming relatively more"outsiders"to the bloc, may have led to a decline in the welfare of both the exporting and <b>importing</b> <b>member</b> countries. This is supported by the data, and implies that if one of the five member countries had been left out of the CACM, it would have been worse off where white maize was concerned.

40|$|The article {{discusses}} {{the problem of}} privately subsidized recycling schemes that are common {{in the developed countries}} and that may in certain circumstances harm the environment of developing countries {{as a result of the}} asymmetry in economic development and environmental protection between them and the developed countries where the products originate. This may happen, for instance, when such products are exported to developing countries and have a negative impact on the economic viability of collection and recycling of their own waste. Newly established and still struggling recycling plants, unsupported by private or governmental subsidies or other protective measures prevailing in the rich and more environmentally conscious countries, may be forced to close down. Alternatively, they may decide to abandon expensive collection of local waste, in favor of free or subsidized waste imported from developed countries. In both cases, collection and recycling activities in the importing countries are reduced, and sometimes eliminated. The objective of this article is to document and draw attention to this problem, that has not yet been discussed in the rich literature on trade 2 ̆ 6 environment, and to examine the question of what remedies, if any, may be offered under international trade law (in particular GATT/WTO rules) to affected countries. Would countries in situations as those described above be permitted to take measures against imports harming their recycling activities? Of particular interest in this regard, is how to relate to privately paid, but governmentally induced, subsidies under the WTO Subsidies Agreement? Such subsidies, while fulfilling most economic definitions of subsidies, appear to have escaped the attention of the Agreement’s drafters and may therefore be outside its scope. <b>Importing</b> <b>member</b> countries would therefore be precluded from taking countervailing measures against products enjoying such subsidies. These and other potential protective measures will be discussed in the article, in light of recent case law of the WTO, in particular in the matter of United States – Measures Treating Export Restraints as Subsidies. This discussion will demonstrate the formalistic nature of the existing WTO jurisprudence and show how a more purposive, teleological approach to interpretation of international trade rules could lead to a better solution to the problem at hand...|$|E
