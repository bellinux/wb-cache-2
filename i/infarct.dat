5|$|Obstruction {{of blood}} {{flow through the}} {{affected}} vessel may lead to dysfunction of {{part of the brain}} supplied by the artery. This happens in 77–96% of cases. This may be temporary ("transient ischemic attack") in 10–16% of cases, but many (67–85% of cases) end up with a permanent deficit or a stroke. The vertebral artery supplies {{the part of the brain}} that lies in the posterior fossa of the skull, and this type of stroke is therefore called a posterior circulation <b>infarct.</b> Problems may include difficulty speaking or swallowing (lateral medullary syndrome); this occurs in less than a fifth of cases and occurs due to dysfunction of the brainstem. Others may experience unsteadiness or lack of coordination due to involvement of the cerebellum, and still others may develop visual loss (on one side of the visual field) due to involvement of the visual cortex in the occipital lobe. In the event of involvement of the sympathetic tracts in the brainstem, a partial Horner's syndrome may develop; this is the combination of a drooping eyelid, constricted pupil, and an apparently sunken eye on one side of the face.|$|E
25|$|Thrombus {{formation}} {{can also}} take place within the ventricles, and it occurs in approximately 30% of anterior-wall myocardial infarctions, compared with only 5% of inferior ones.

In the first three months after infarction, left-ventricle aneurysms have a 10% risk of emboli forming.|$|E
25|$|Other {{factors such}} as toxicants can {{adversely}} impact bone cells. Infections, chronic or acute, can affect blood flow by inducing platelet activation and aggregation, contributing to a localized state of excess coagulability (hypercoagulability) that may contribute to clot formation (thrombosis), a known cause of bone <b>infarct</b> and ischaemia. Exogenous estrogens, also called hormonal disruptors, have been linked with an increased tendency to clot (thrombophilia) and impaired bone healing.|$|E

40|$|We {{reviewed}} 88 pathologically proven cerebellar <b>infarcts,</b> {{examining the}} entire thoracocervical arterial system (including the spinal {{part of the}} vertebral artery, the intracranial arteries, and the heart) in all cases. For 50 <b>infarcts,</b> we found an arterial occlusion. The intracranial part of the vertebral artery was involved in 38 <b>infarcts</b> (76 %), the basilar artery in 20 <b>infarcts</b> (40 %), and a cerebellar artery in 12 <b>infarcts</b> (24 %). Eight <b>infarcts</b> were due to bilateral distal vertebral artery occlusions. For the 50 <b>infarcts,</b> {{the cause of the}} occlusion was atherosclerosis in 28 (56 %) and a cardiac embolism in 12 (24 %). For the remaining 38 <b>infarcts,</b> we found no arterial occlusions on postmortem examination. Of these 38 <b>infarcts,</b> 26 (68 %) were associated with a cardiac source of emboli. For the entire group of 88 <b>infarcts,</b> atherosclerosis was the cause in 31 (35 %), while a cardiac embolism was proven or presumed in 38 (43 %). Dissecting aneurysms, atherosclerotic artery-to-artery embolism, or hemodynamic mechanisms could have been responsible for a few <b>infarcts.</b> We conclude that cerebellar <b>infarcts</b> often arise from cardiogenic embolism. (Stroke 1990; 21 : 1299 - 1305) Data on the mechanisms of cerebellar infarc-tion are scarce.

25|$|Myocardial {{infarction}} (MI) {{or heart}} attack, {{is caused by}} ischemia, (restriction in the blood supply), often due to the obstruction of a coronary artery by a thrombus. This restriction gives an insufficient supply of oxygen to the heart muscle which then results in tissue death,(infarction). A lesion is then formed which is the <b>infarct.</b> MI can quickly become fatal if emergency medical treatment is not received promptly. If diagnosed within 12 hours of the initial episode (attack) then thrombolytic therapy is initiated.|$|E
25|$|On {{physical}} examination, {{the lungs}} are usually normal. Occasionally, a pleural friction rub may be audible over {{the affected area}} of the lung (mostly in PE with <b>infarct).</b> A pleural effusion is sometimes present that is exudative, detectable by decreased percussion note, audible breath sounds, and vocal resonance. Strain on the right ventricle may be detected as a left parasternal heave, a loud pulmonary component of the second heart sound, and/or raised jugular venous pressure. A low-grade fever may be present, particularly if there is associated pulmonary hemorrhage or infarction.|$|E
40|$|Background and Purpose—Silent brain <b>infarcts</b> are {{commonly}} seen on {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) both in patients with a first stroke and in healthy elderly persons. These <b>infarcts</b> seem {{associated with an increased}} risk of stroke. It is unclear whether risk factors for silent <b>infarcts</b> differ from those for symptomatic stroke. We investigated the prevalence of, and cardiovascular risk factors for, silent brain <b>infarcts.</b> Methods—The Rotterdam Scan Study is a population-based cohort study among 1077 participants 60 to 90 years of age. Participants underwent cerebral MRI. We assessed cardiovascular risk factors by interview and physical examination. Associations between risk factors and presence of <b>infarcts</b> were analyzed by logistic regression and adjusted for age, sex, and relevant confounders. Results—For 259 participants (24 %) 1 or more <b>infarcts</b> on MRI were seen; 217 persons had only silent and 42 had symptomatic <b>infarcts.</b> The prevalence odds ratio (OR) of both silent and symptomatic <b>infarcts</b> increased with age by 8 % per year (95 % CI, 1. 06 to 1. 10 and 1. 04 to 1. 13, respectively). Silent <b>infarcts</b> were more frequent in women (age-adjusted OR, 1. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 0 to 1. 8).

25|$|Persons with ONJ {{may have}} either {{necrotic}} bone or bone marrow {{that has been}} slowly strangulated or nutrient-starved. Bone with chronically poor blood flow develops either a fibrous marrow since fibres can more easily live in nutrient starved areas, a greasy, dead fatty marrow (wet rot), a very dry, sometimes leathery marrow (dry rot), or a completely hollow marrow space (osteocavitation), also typical of ONJ. The blood flow impairment occurs following a bone <b>infarct,</b> a blood clot forming inside the smaller blood vessels of cancellous bone tissue.|$|E
25|$|Conduction aphasia {{is caused}} by damage to the arcuate {{fasciculus}}. The arcuate fasciculus is a white matter tract that connects Broca’s and Wernicke’s areas. Patients with conduction aphasia typically have good language comprehension, but poor speech repetition and mild difficulty with word retrieval and speech production. Patients with conduction aphasia are typically aware of their errors. The awareness of errors and the milder nature of conduction aphasia compared to other types contributes to a positive outcome. Additionally, a case study completed on a 54-year-old man with a large <b>infarct</b> in the arcuate fasciculus indicated that severe conduction aphasia can be successfully treated. Despite his global deficits, he made a full recovery after 30 months.|$|E
25|$|Research done {{in animals}} {{has shown that}} {{subjects}} recovering in an enriched environment 15 days after having a stroke had significantly improved neurobehavioral function. In addition these same subjects showed greater capability of learning and larger <b>infarct</b> post-intervention {{than those who were}} not in an enriched environment. It was thus concluded that environmental enrichment had a considerable beneficial effect on the learning and sensorimotor functions on animals post-stroke. A 2013 study also found that environmental enrichment socially benefits patients recovering from stroke. Researchers in that study concluded that stroke patients in enriched environments in assisted-care facilities {{are much more likely to}} be engaging with other patients during normal social hours instead of being alone or sleeping.|$|E
40|$|The {{sensitivity}} of single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) in evaluating posterior circulation <b>infarcts</b> {{compared with that}} of computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains unknown. In a hospital-based population, the authors studied SPECT, CT, and MRI in 35 consecutive patients presenting with acute infarction clinically localized in the thalamus (7), posterior cerebral artery (PCA) territory (15), brainstem (19), and cerebellum (3). Multiple <b>infarcts</b> were noted in 8 patients. Overall, the SPECT sensitivity was lower than that of MRI (21 % vs 93 %, p = 0. 004) and CT (42 % vs 65 %, p = 0. 046). The SPECT and CT sensitivities were not significantly different (67 % vs 73 %) for PCA <b>infarcts.</b> Performed within 24 hours, SPECT showed a relevant hypoperfusion in all PCA <b>infarcts.</b> For brainstem <b>infarcts,</b> CT (33 %, p = 0. 074) and MRI (91 %, p = 0. 004) were more sensitive than SPECT, which showed no hemispheric hypoperfusion. The {{sensitivity of}} the three imaging techniques was 100 % for large cerebellar <b>infarcts.</b> For the small group of thalamic <b>infarcts,</b> the SPECT, CT, and MRI sensitivities were 14, 71, and 100 %, respectively. Thus, SPECT compared to CT and MRI is not helpful in the subacute phase to localize PCA and cerebellar <b>infarcts</b> and is of limited value for thalamic <b>infarcts.</b> In the first hours, the absence of cerebral hypoperfusion in brainstem <b>infarcts</b> may help to differentiate them from hemispheric <b>infarcts</b> usually associated with profound hypoperfusion...|$|R

We examined {{the prevalence of}} symptomatic and silent <b>infarcts</b> on cranial computerized tomography (cCT) and their relation to dementia and mortality in {{a representative sample of}} 239 85 -year-olds living in Gothenburg Sweden. Methods—Information on stroke was obtained from an inpatient hospital linkage system, self-reports, and key informants. Dementia was defined according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 3 rd revision. Cortical and lacunar <b>infarcts</b> were diagnosed on cCT. Results—The prevalence of cerebral <b>infarcts</b> was 17. 1 %, and half of those were clinically silent (8. 6 %). The frequency of dementia was increased in those with symptomatic (OR, 5. 5; 95 % CI, 2. 1 to 14. 1) and silent <b>infarcts</b> (OR, 2. 7; 95 % CI, 1. 1 to 6. 7). <b>Infarcts</b> increased the risk for dementia and its severity in women but not in men. The 3 -year mortality rate was increased in those with symptomatic (OR, 4. 0; 95 % CI, 1. 6 to 9. 6) and silent <b>infarcts</b> (OR, 3. 4; 95 % CI, 1. 4 to 8. 5). Conclusions—Almost one fifth of 85 -year-olds have <b>infarcts</b> on cCT, and half of those are clinically silent. These <b>infarcts</b> are related to an increased rate of dementia and 3 -year mortality. Cerebrovascular disease as a cause of dementia may be underrated because of silent <b>infarcts.</b> It has to be elucidated whether treatment of risk factors for stroke may reduce the consequences of silent <b>infarcts.</b> (Stroke. 2004; 35 : 1816 - 1820.)

25|$|CT {{angiography}} {{can act as}} a less invasive {{alternative to}} Catheter angiography. Instead of a catheter being inserted into a vein or artery, CT angiography involves only the injection of a CT-visible dye into the arm or hand via an IV line. CT angiography lowers the risk of arterial perforation and catheter site infection. It provides 3D images that can be studied on computer, and also allows measurement of heart ventricle size. <b>Infarct</b> area and arterial calcium can also be observed (however those require a somewhat higher radiation exposure). That said, one advantage retained by Catheter angiography is the ability of the physician to perform procedure such as balloon angioplasty or insertion of a stent to improve blood flow to the artery.|$|E
25|$|Since ONJ {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} in many patients {{who did not}} take bisphosphonates, it is thus logical to assume that bisphosphonates {{are not the only}} factor in ONJ. While the oversuppression of bone turnover seems {{to play a major role}} in aggravating the disease process, other factors can and do initiate the pathophysiological mechanisms responsible for ONJ. In non-bisphosphonate cases of ONJ, it is mainly the cancellous portion of the bone and its marrow content that are involved in the disease process. The first stage is an oedema of the bone marrow initiated by a bone <b>infarct,</b> which is itself modulated by numerous causes, leading to myelofibrosis as a result of hypoxia and gradual loss of mineral bone density characteristic of ischaemic osteoporosis. Further deterioration can be triggered by additional bone infarcts leading to anoxia and a localized areas of osteonecrosis within the osteoporotic cancellous bone. Secondary events such as dental infection, injection of local anaesthetics with vasoconstrictors, such as epinephrine, and trauma can add further complications to the disease process and chronic non-pus forming bone infection osteomyelitis can also be associated with ONJ.|$|E
25|$|H2S therapy uses a H2S donor, such as diallyl trisulfide (DATS), to {{increase}} the supply of H2S to an AMI patient. H2S donors reduce myocardial injury and reperfusion complications. Increased H2S levels within the body will react with oxygen to produce sulfane sulfur, a storage intermediate for H2S. H2S pools in the body attracts oxygen to react with excess H2S and eNOS {{to increase}} NO production. With increased use of oxygen to produce more NO, less oxygen is available to react with eNOS to produce superoxides during an AMI, ultimately lowering the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS). Furthermore, decreased accumulation of ROS lowers oxidative stress in vascular smooth muscle cells, decreasing oxidative degeneration of BH4. Increased BH4 cofactor contributes to increased production of NO within the body. Higher concentrations of H2S directly increase eNOS activity through Akt activation to increase phosphorylation of the eNOSS1177 activation site, and decrease phosphorylation of the eNOST495 inhibition site. This phosphorylation process upregulates eNOS activity, catalyzing more conversion of L-arginine to NO. Increased NO production enables soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) activity, leading to an increased conversion of guanosine triphosphate (GTP) to 3’,5’-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP). In H2S therapy immediately following an AMI, increased cGMP triggers an increase in protein kinase G (PKG) activity. PKG reduces intracellular Ca2+ in vascular smooth muscle to increase smooth muscle relaxation and promote blood flow. PKG also limits smooth muscle cell proliferation, reducing intima thickening following AMI injury, ultimately decreasing myocardial <b>infarct</b> size.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are various}} {{classification}} systems for acute ischemic stroke.

These four entities predict the extent of the stroke, the area of the brain that is affected, the underlying cause, and the prognosis. The TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) classification is based on clinical symptoms as well as results of further investigations; on this basis, a stroke is classified as being due to (1) thrombosis or embolism due to atherosclerosis of a large artery, (2) an embolism originating in the heart, (3) complete blockage of a small blood vessel, (4) other determined cause, (5) undetermined cause (two possible causes, no cause identified, or incomplete investigation).
