25|$|At around 14:30 {{on the day}} of the murder, {{he called}} his wife to say he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> his {{motorcycle}} and visit his grandchild. He never arrived at his grandson's house, and his mobile phone was turned off by 18:00. His wife Lyudmila called a friend and walked around the village, afraid that her husband might have fallen ill or had a motorcycle accident. They could not locate any sign of him. They also could not file a missing person's report, since in Ukraine a person cannot be declared missing until at least 72 hours after last being seen. The next day, Lyudmila posted photographs of her husband around the village, and enlisted more local help to search the surrounding area. Four days later, a local who saw one of Lyudmila's posters remembered seeing an abandoned Dnepr bike in a remote wooded area by a garbage dump. He took Yatzenko's relatives to the scene, where they discovered his mutilated and decomposing body.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1958, {{having won}} 56 {{national}} and international singles and doubles titles, Gibson retired from amateur tennis. Prior to the Open Era there was no prize money at major tournaments, and direct endorsement deals were prohibited. Players were limited to meager expense allowances, strictly regulated by the USTA. [...] "The truth, to put it bluntly, is that my finances were in heartbreaking shape," [...] she wrote. [...] "Being the Queen of Tennis is all well and good, but you can't eat a crown. Nor can you send the Internal Revenue Service a throne clipped to their tax forms. The landlord and grocer and tax collector are funny that way: they like cold cash ... I reign over an empty bank account, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> it by playing amateur tennis." [...] Professional tours for women were still 15 years away, so her opportunities were largely limited to promotional events. [...] In 1959 she signed to play a series of exhibition matches against Karol Fageros before Harlem Globetrotter basketball games. When the tour ended she won the singles and doubles titles at the Pepsi Cola World Pro Tennis Championships in Cleveland, but received only $500 in prize money.|$|E

60|$|By dint {{of great}} exertions the Henriette was {{unloaded}} {{by the following}} evening and, half an hour after her last bale was ashore, she dropped down the river with the tide. She was to anchor off a small village, two miles beyond Fort Medoc; and if inquiry was made as to why she stopped there, Lefaux was {{to say that he}} was to take in some wine that Monsieur Flambard had bought from a large grower in that district, and that the lugger was then <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Charente <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> up with brandy for Havre.|$|R
5000|$|The party {{platform}} stands on solidarity and pluralism.

60|$|A second rope, {{also made}} from {{sections}} of a blanket-- but {{stronger than the}} first-- was produced. As the lower end struck the ground, Pelter commenced to slide down, closely followed by his partner. Evidently they were both willing to risk their lives {{in an effort to}} escape. The thought of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> jail <b>filled</b> them with grim terror.|$|R

6000|$|... "It {{would have}} been just as easy for you to have stayed outside with your {{business}} leg, instead of dragging it into private life in that obtrusive way," [...] retorted the Right Bower; [...] "but that exhaustive effort is n't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the pork barrel.

60|$|He {{took out}} his black pipe and was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> it with negro-head, when, looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand, he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative. He put it back again, stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat, spread a hand on each knee, and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments, looked round at us and said what follows.|$|E
6000|$|... "Get up! You can't lie snivelling there. Now, then, {{stick in}} the fuse first. Now put in the powder. Hold on, hold on! Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the hole all up?

[...] He {{snatched}} the iron and tamped the charge himself, meantime cursing and blaspheming like a fiend. Then he fired the fuse, climbed out of the shaft, and ran fifty yards away, Fetlock following. They stood waiting a few minutes, then a great volume of smoke and rocks burst high into the air with a thunderous explosion; after a little there was a shower of descending stones; then all was serene again.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{mean you}} are going to tell the truth as you have just told it," [...] replied Fisher. [...] "You are going to placard this town with the wickedness done to old Wilkins. You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> the {{newspapers}} with the infamous story of Mrs. Biddle. You are going to denounce Verner from a public platform, naming him for what he did and naming the poacher he did it to. And you're going to find out by what trade this man made the money with which he bought the estate; and when you know the truth, as I said before, of course {{you are going}} to tell it. Upon those terms I come under the old flag, as you call it, and haul down my little pennon." ...|$|E

50|$|Germanys high-altitude {{needs were}} {{originally}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>filled</b> by a 75 mm gun from Krupp, designed {{in collaboration with}} their Swedish counterpart Bofors, but the specifications were later amended to require much higher performance. In response Krupps engineers presented a new 88 mm design, the FlaK 36. First used in Spain during the Spanish Civil War, the gun proved {{to be one of}} the best anti-aircraft guns in the world, as well as particularly deadly against light, medium, and even early heavy tanks.|$|R
60|$|He went {{to sleep}} again soon afterward, and Weston was left in peace. In front of him the great {{locomotive}} snorted up the climbing track, hurling clouds of sparks aloft. Misty pines went streaming by, the chill night wind rushed past, the cars banged and clanked, and now and then odd bursts of harsh laughter or discordant singing broke through the roar of wheels. It {{was very different from}} the deep tranquillity of the wilderness and the quiet composure of the people with whom he had spent the last few weeks, but, as Ida Stirling had suggested, Weston's blood was red, and he was still young enough to find pleasure in every fresh draught of the wine of life. It was something to feel himself the equal in bodily strength and animal courage of these strong-armed men who were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> up the muskeg.|$|E

"And {{perhaps you}} would have {{forgotten}} heaven in that earthly paradise; who knows, your happiness might have drawn you away from God, you might have spent your life in earthly joys, you might have danced and sung and thought {{more and more of}} pleasure, and less and less of God. Who knows? Whereas now you are just going to be happy in God's way: {{you are going to do}} your duty by your mother and your father, and, above all, by your husband. You are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>fill</b> your life by thoughts of God first and then of others, instead of filling it with purely selfish joys. You are going to walk up the road of life, my child, with duty to guide you over the roughnesses and hard stones that will bestrew your path: and every roughness which is surmounted, every hardship which is endured, every sacrifice of self which is offered up to One who made the greatest possible sacrifice for us all, will leave you happier than before [...] . . . happier in God's way, the best way of all." ...|$|E

50|$|One {{major problem}} about this {{theory is that}} in real-life situation, the time between {{encoding}} a piece of information and recalling it, is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>filled</b> with {{all different kinds of}} events that might happen to the individual. Therefore, it is difficult to conclude that forgetting is a result of only the time duration. It is also important to consider the effectiveness of this theory. Although it seems very plausible, it is about impossible to test. It is difficult to create a situation where there is a blank period of time between presenting the material and recalling it later.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Ian Spelling of The New York Times, actress Linda Park who portrays character Hoshi Sato on Enterprise cited [...] "Fight or Flight" [...] to the journalist, {{as an example of}} the progression and growth of her character during the series. In the book Star Trek 101 by Terry J. Erdmann and Paula M. Block quoted dialog from Park's character, in an overview of description of Hoshi Sato: [...] "I was Jonathan Archer's first choice for this mission.

On December 28, 2015, {{in an interview}} with Forbes, 2 Chainz spoke on album, saying [...] "As far as the ColleGrove project, I really feel like the music is tight and accessible. Wayne has always been one of my favorite rappers. We’re just doing some mixing and trying to grind up.

50|$|As a {{young boy}} he was always doing bad things in his {{hometown}} of Aguacaliente De Garate, Sinaloa.

5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Time Magazine, Swift said that [...] "the setlist will be predominantly songs from 1989. ... I have so many things I've been dreaming up for this. If {{you look at the}} makeup of my previous music, as far as production elements go, {{there are a lot of}} live drums, acoustic guitars, electric guitars, and live bass. And if you look at the landscape of 1989, it's mostly synths and automated drums and these kind of big epic synth pad sounds, and key bass, and layered vocals. I have a very big band, there are, what, 14 of us, so what you’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> end up with is more of a live feel in that it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>filled</b> in and more dramatic with more layers to it, but never to the point where it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> feel noisy or overcrowded." ...|$|R

50|$|The {{proteins}} of {{the glue}} soak {{into the wood}} and interlace with its pores. Setting of the glue occurs with cooling and drying, so the working time is very short, {{on the order of}} minutes, to stick the parts together and get full strength, unlike PVA glue which might provide 20-30 minutes.Furthermore, since the glue only works by microscopically stitching the wood fibers together, any gaps in the joint are not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be successfully <b>filled,</b> and so the mating surface must be very smooth.|$|R
