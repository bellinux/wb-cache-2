5|$|Plan after plan is thwarted: Elaine tries bribing the maître d'hôtel, but is unsuccessful. They {{contemplate}} {{on getting}} food to go, but they can't eat Chinese {{food in a}} taxicab. Elaine is ravenous, but refuses to eat concession stand food at the movie theater. After missing Tatiana's call, George decides he's {{no longer in the}} mood for the film, Elaine wants to leave and get a hamburger, and Jerry decides that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have dinner with his uncle. As soon as they leave, the maître d' calls their party.|$|E

Kankkunen {{finished}} eighth and Räikkönen 25th due to car trouble. He finished seventh in the Rallye Deutschland, his second ever asphalt rally, while notching up his first ever career stage win, the last stage of the rally.|$|E

25|$|An {{area where}} African Americans in general {{outstrip}} whites {{is in their}} condemnation of homosexuality. Prominent leaders in the Black church have demonstrated against gay rights issues such as gay marriage. This stands {{in stark contrast to}} the down-low phenomenon of covert male–male sexual acts. There are those within the community who take a different position, notably the late Coretta Scott King and the Reverend Al Sharpton, the latter of whom, when asked in 2003 whether he supported gay marriage, replied that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have been asked if he supported black marriage or white marriage.|$|E
25|$|With {{his freedom}} restored, the Doctor chose to {{counteract}} his extended exile by seeking as much non-human company as possible. During this period, the Doctor encountered {{all manner of}} unusual beings – from a species that at cursory glance resembled the Earth tiger (The Year of Intelligent Tigers), to water spirits, to talking apes from another dimension. Though at times the Doctor seemed somewhat cold – as when he seemed more concerned about damaged plums than a dead man (Eater of Wasps) – he retained his passion for life in all forms. Although his amnesia remained a bother, the Doctor acknowledged that whatever {{had happened to him}} had happened for a reason, and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make use of the advantages it offered.|$|E
500|$|Cobain {{chose not}} to overdub a harmony vocal part during the Smart Studios sessions, {{possibly}} due to time constraints. During the Nevermind sessions, Vig had Grohl sing harmonies on the song. Grohl had difficulty hitting the proper notes, but ultimately was able to sing what Vig wanted. Vig often had to trick Cobain, who was averse to performing multiple takes, into recording additional takes for overdubs on the record. The producer convinced Cobain to double-track his vocals on [...] "In Bloom" [...] by telling him, [...] "John Lennon did it." [...] After doubling Cobain's vocals, Vig decided <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> double Grohl's and had the drummer record an additional track of backing harmonies.|$|E

500|$|The {{small crowd}} in Worcester were {{angered by the}} decision, and Worcestershire's {{secretary}} Mike Vockins gave all those present a full refund while describing Somerset's declaration as [...] "an absolute disgrace". Some Somerset fans had travelled over [...] to watch the game, while Alan Gibson of The Times (although note that this paper was on strike at the time) had only just arrived at the railway station when he was told by a porter that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> head back as the match had finished. The Somerset team left the ground within 14 minutes {{of the end of}} the game. As they were leaving, one spectator banged on Rose's car window and shouted at him, [...] "You've done a terrible thing for cricket." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Gadsden's {{antagonistic}} manner" [...] alienated Santa Anna. [...] Gadsden {{had advised}} Santa Anna that [...] "the {{spirit of the}} age" [...] would soon lead the northern states to secede so <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> sell them now. The Mexican President felt threatened by William Walker's attempt to capture Baja California with 50 troops and annex Sonora. Gadsden disavowed any government backing of Walker, who was expelled by the U.S. and placed on trial as a criminal. [...] Santa Anna worried that the US would allow further aggression against [...] Mexican territory. [...] Santa Anna needed {{to get as much}} money for as little territory as possible. [...] When Great Britain rejected Mexican requests to assist in the negotiations, Santa Anna opted for the $15 million package (equivalent to $ in [...] ).|$|E
500|$|Theroux {{described}} approaching filming without entirely {{understanding what}} the plot was about: [...] "You {{get the whole}} script, but <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> withhold the scenes you're not in, because the whole {{turns out to be}} more mystifying than the parts. David welcomes questions, but he won't answer any of them... You work kind of half-blindfolded. If he were a first-time director and hadn't demonstrated any command of this method, I'd probably have reservations. But it obviously works for him." [...] Theroux noted that the only answer Lynch did provide was that he was certain that Theroux's character, a Hollywood director, was not autobiographical of Lynch. Watts stated that she tried to bluff Lynch by pretending she had the plot figured out, and that he delighted in the cast's frustration.|$|E

500|$|Fischer {{associated}} with the Worldwide Church of God in the mid-1960s. The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath, and forbade work (and competitive chess) on Sabbath. According to his friend and colleague Larry Evans, in 1968 Fischer felt philosophically that [...] "the world {{was coming to an}} end" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> make some money by publishing My 60 Memorable Games; Fischer thought that the Rapture was coming soon. During the mid 1970s Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God. In 1972 one journalist stated that [...] "Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess", and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess. Yet, prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled, and the church was rocked by revelations of a series of sex scandals involving Garner Ted Armstrong. Fischer eventually left the church in 1977, [...] "accusing it of being 'Satanic', and vigorously attacking its methods and leadership." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the voyage}} to England Kruger {{encountered}} a 19-year-old law student from the Orange Free State named Martinus Theunis Steyn. Jorissen and Bok marvelled at Kruger, {{in their eyes}} more suited to the 17th century than his own time. One night, when Kruger heard the two Dutchmen discussing celestial bodies {{and the structure of}} the universe, he interjected that if their conversation was accurate and the Earth was not flat, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> throw his Bible overboard. At the Colonial Office in Whitehall, Carnarvon and Kruger's own colleagues were astonished when, speaking through interpreters, he rose to what Meintjes calls [...] "remarkable heights of oratory", averring that the annexation breached the Sand River Convention and went against the popular will in the Transvaal. His arguments were undermined by reports to the contrary from Shepstone and other British officials, and by a widely publicised letter from a Potchefstroom vicar claiming that Kruger only represented the will of [...] "a handful of irreconcilables". Carnarvon dismissed Kruger's idea of a general plebiscite and concluded that British rule would remain.|$|E
500|$|Carey {{recorded}} {{an official}} remix version for [...] "We Belong Together", which she produced with DJ Clue. The remix features vocals from rappers Jadakiss and Styles P, {{two-thirds of the}} hip-hop trio the LOX. The remix is fundamentally different from the original, described as having [...] "a faster, springier backbeat" [...] by Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times. Lyrically, the song {{is similar to the}} album version of the song, in which both rappers' verses contemplate on past memories. Styles P raps [...] "Past is the past, just let it be bygones / Matter of fact I know a fly song that we could vibe on", which Sanneh writes [...] "Cheerfully out of place, he sounds like a man who has wandered into the wrong summertime party, but so what? He figures <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> stick around and enjoy it." [...] In two separate reviews of The Emancipation of Mimi, Sanneh referred to the song as both [...] "great" [...] and [...] "excellent", in regards to the remix.|$|E

500|$|Later that year, Fillmore went abroad, stating {{publicly}} {{that as he}} lacked office, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> travel. [...] The trip was at the advice of political friends, who felt that by touring, he would avoid involvement in the contentious issues of the day, and he spent over a year, from March 1855 to June 1856, in Europe and the Middle East. Queen Victoria {{is said to have}} pronounced the ex-president the handsomest man she had ever seen, while his presence in the gallery of the House of Commons {{at the same time as}} Van Buren excited a comment from MP John Bright. Fillmore was offered an honorary Doctor of Civil Law (D.C.L.) degree by the University of Oxford. Fillmore turned down the honor, explaining that he had neither the [...] "literary nor scientific attainment" [...] to justify the degree. He is also quoted as having explained that he [...] "lacked the benefit of a classical education" [...] and could not, therefore, understand the Latin text of the diploma, adding that he believed [...] "no man should accept a degree he cannot read." [...] Another possibility is that Fillmore refused the degree to escape the heckling and taunting to which Oxford students typically subjected the recipients of such honors.|$|E
2500|$|His garb was in tatters, {{his beard}} an ugly stubble, his eyes bloodshot. [...] He had the gauntiness [...] in feature of a wasted consumptive. [...] He was shackled.

2500|$|Viktor Kuzin, {{a member}} of the Moscow City Council and a founder of the Democratic Union in Russia, {{travelled}} to Minnesota in 1993 to meet LaRouche in prison, and afterwards participated in international campaigns to exonerate LaRouche. An advertisement calling for exoneration was published in several US Newspapers, signed by Kuzin, Civil Rights attorney J.L. Chestnut, former Ugandan President Godfrey Binaisa, and others. Chestnut was interviewed in the Tuscaloosa News saying that when he met LaRouche, [...] "I told him that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be black and in Alabama." ...|$|E
60|$|Then Ginger {{began to}} wriggle {{and try and}} twist the cords off, but <b>'e</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> 'ave tried to wriggle out of 'is skin. The worst of it was they couldn't make known their {{intentions}} to each other, and when Peter Russet leaned over 'im and tried to work 'is gag off by rubbing it up agin 'is nose, Ginger pretty near went crazy with temper. He banged Peter with his 'ead, and Peter banged back, and they kept it up till they'd both got splitting 'eadaches, and at last they gave up in despair and lay in the darkness waiting for Sam.|$|R

2500|$|Bruner {{has accused}} President Barack Obama of {{formerly}} being a drug-using gay prostitute, writing in October 2015: [...] "Obama has {{a soft spot}} for homosexuals because of the years he spent as a male prostitute in his twenties. That is how he paid for his drugs." [...] "He has admitted he was addicted to drugs when he was young and he is sympathetic with homosexuals, but he hasn't {{come out of the closet}} about his own homosexual/bisexual background." [...] She continued, [...] "He hasn't quite evolved that much! Since he supports gay marriage, he should be proud of his background as a homosexual/bisexual. He is against everything else Christians stand for, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be for infidelity." [...] Bruner has referred to Obama as [...] "Ahab the Arab" [...] and said that the president [...] "hates all white people and all wealthy people because to him wealthy means white." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{turning point}} in Zimmer's career {{occurred}} with the 1988 film Rain Man. Hollywood director Barry Levinson was {{looking for someone to}} score Rain Man, and his wife heard the soundtrack CD of the anti-apartheid drama A World Apart, for which Zimmer had composed the music. Levinson was impressed by Zimmer's work and hired him to score Rain Man. In the score, Zimmer uses synthesizers (mostly a Fairlight CMI) mixed with steel drums. Zimmer explained that [...] "It was a road movie, and road movies usually have jangly guitars or a bunch of strings. I kept thinking don't be bigger than the characters. Try to keep it contained. The Raymond character doesn't actually know where he is. The world is so different to him. <b>He</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> be on Mars. So, why don't we just invent our own world music for a world that doesn't really exist?". Zimmer’s score for Rain Man was nominated for an Academy Award in 1989, and the film won four Academy Awards including Best Picture.|$|E
2500|$|After Love Never Dies {{opened on}} 9 March 2010 in London, it {{received}} mostly negative critical reviews. Perhaps {{the most positive}} review was Paul Taylor's in The Independent giving the show five stars, and writing, [...] "What is in no doubt is the technical excellence of Jack O'Brien's seamlessly fluent, sumptuous (and sometimes subtle) production, or the splendour of the orchestra which pours forth Lloyd Webber's dark-hued, yearning melodies as if its life depended on them. Special praise {{should go to the}} lyrical lavishness of Bob Crowley and Jon Driscoll's designs, with their gilt interiors where the vegetation-imitating contours and giant peacock-plumage of Art Nouveau run rampant, and their ghostly external locations where a brilliantly deployed combination of flowing projection (timed to perfection with emotional/ rhythmic shifts in the music) and solidly presented stage-effects create a dizzying Coney Island of the mind". In stark contrast, Ben Brantley of The New York Times gave it zero stars, calling the production [...] "a big, gaudy new show. And <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> have a [...] "kick me" [...] sign pasted to his backside. ... This poor sap of a show feels as eager to be walloped as a clown in a carnival dunking booth. Why bother, when from beginning to end, Love Never Dies is its very own spoiler." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>might</b> almost <b>as</b> <b>well</b> {{have sat}} up all night. In {{the morning he}} arose at seven, and shortly after went out, taking the {{direction}} of the chief post-office. At the door he met an intelligent postman coming out with letters for the morning delivery.|$|R
50|$|The melamed was {{appointed}} by the community, and there were special regulations determining how many children <b>he</b> <b>might</b> teach, <b>as</b> <b>well</b> <b>as</b> rules governing the choice of applicants for the office and the dismissal of a melamed.
