The assumptions {{that we make}} {{are the same as}} the Black-Scholes ones and the resulting pricing equations are Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type equations or parabolic free boundary PDE's which can be solved via finite difference methods. 1 1 Introduction: the Vanilla Passport Option The Passport Option is {{an insurance}} against trading loss. The noteholder is allowed to `trade' a particular asset (of price S) during the life of the Option, T. The number of assets he 'holds' at a particular time t is denoted q and can be positive (if the noteholder thinks the asset price is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go up) or negative (if <b>he</b> thinks <b>S</b> is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> go down). There is however a constraint (specified in the contract) on q, this is the position limit C: jqj C. So q can be any value in [; C] and it is the noteholder who decide [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{evaluate}} the Soret effect in liquid Fe-Ni-S-P alloys {{in order to gain}} a better understanding of the physical and thermodynamic properties of metallic liquids and to assess the possibility of systematic errors in Czochralski growth techniques. The metal-sulfide liquids were found to show a substantial Soret effect and, contrary to previous expectation, can be as large as that seen in the silicate system. The segregation is largely produced by S-Fe interactions. The P redistribution occurs to reduce activity gradients in P consequent upon S gradients, and P segregation can be approximately predicted in Fe-Ni-S liquids using the activity model of Jones and Malvin (1990). It is inferred that the sense of the Soret segregation, with P <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the cold end and <b>S</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the hot end, is in accordance with the prediction of Malvin et al.

Using a controlled experiment, we examine the role of nurture in explaining the stylized fact that women shy away from competition. Our subjects (students just under 15 years of age) attend publicly-funded single-sex and coeducational schools. We find robust differences between the competitive choices of girls from single-sex and coed schools. Moreover, girls from single-sex schools behave more like boys even when randomly assigned to mixed-sex experimental groups. Thus it is untrue that the average female avoids competitive behaviour {{more than the average}} male.
