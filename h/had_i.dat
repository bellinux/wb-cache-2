25|$|Immediately on our {{coming up}} out of the water after we had been baptized, we {{experienced}} great and glorious blessings from our Heavenly Father. No sooner <b>had</b> <b>I</b> baptized Oliver Cowdery, than the Holy Ghost fell upon him, and he stood up and prophesied many things which should shortly come to pass. And again, so soon as I had been baptized by him, I also had the spirit of prophecy, when, standing up, I prophesied concerning the rise of this Church, and many other things connected with the Church, and this generation of the children of men. We were filled with the Holy Ghost, and rejoiced in the God of our salvation.|$|E

Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that I should take great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
25|$|The British Army {{immediately}} began dispatching the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to support France. At first only regular {{troops from the}} pre-war Army made up its numbers. In 1940, however, men of the Territorial Army (TA) divisions being mobilized in the UK were sent. In the end, the BEF <b>had</b> <b>I,</b> II and III Corps under its command, controlling 200,000 men. The Royal Air Force (RAF) also sent significant forces to France {{at the start of}} hostilities. Some were French Army cooperation squadrons to help with matters like reconnaissance for the French Army. Others were Hawker Hurricane squadrons from RAF Fighter Command. Separately, Bomber Command sent the Advanced Air Striking Force, composed of squadrons flying the Fairey Battle and other machines that did not have the range to reach Germany from the UK.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{the tension}} between the two men during the production, when Price saw the movie the {{following}} year, he admitted that he finally understood what Reeves had been after and wrote the young director a ten-page letter praising the film. Reeves wrote Price back, [...] "I knew you would think so." [...] Years after Reeves's death, Price said, [...] "...I realized what he wanted was a low-key, very laid-back, menacing performance. He did get it, but I was fighting him almost every step of the way. <b>Had</b> <b>I</b> known what he wanted, I would have cooperated." ...|$|E
500|$|Years {{later as}} {{an elderly man}} {{near the end of}} his life, Marques de Sousa would fondly recall his advancement: [...] "Never in my life <b>had</b> <b>I</b> judged myself so great, nor {{experienced}} such ineffable rejoicing... as in the day I placed my fists into the cuffs of alferes.

[...] For the remainder of the conflict he was stationed in the defense of Montevideo.

500|$|Balzac's {{vision of}} {{a society in which}} class, money and {{personal}} ambition are the key players has been endorsed by critics of both left-wing and right-wing political persuasions. Marxist Friedrich Engels wrote: [...] "I have learned more [...] than from all the professional historians, economists and statisticians put together". Balzac has received high praise from critics as diverse as Walter Benjamin and Camille Paglia. He was also praised by James Baldwin, who said 1984: [...] "I’m sure that my life in France would have been very different <b>had</b> <b>I</b> not met Balzac. [...] the way that country and its society works." [...] In 1970 Roland Barthes published S/Z, a detailed analysis of Balzac's story Sarrasine and a key work in structuralist literary criticism.|$|E
500|$|In a 2005 {{lecture at}} Harvard after Jackson's trial, Jackson's {{attorney}} Thomas Mesereau said the following about Jordan Chandler: [...] "The prosecutors {{tried to get}} him to show up and he wouldn't. If he <b>had,</b> <b>I</b> had witnesses who were going to come in and say he told them it never happened and that he would never talk to his parents again for what they made him say. It turned out he'd gone into court and got legal emancipation from his parents." [...] In 2006, Jordan accused Evan of attacking him with a barbell, choking him and spraying his face with Mace. The charges were later dropped. On November 5, 2009, fourteen weeks after Jackson's death, Evan Chandler was found dead following an apparent suicide.|$|E

I wanted the color black {{because it is the}} absence of color. I wanted the color white because it is the combination of all colors. And I wanted the color red because it represents the one thing that all people have in common: blood. I wanted suns instead of stars because stars to me imply searching, like you search for your star. And there are already too many stars in this world. But the sun, that's something that is always there, looking right at you. Betsy Ross did the best she could with what she <b>had.</b> <b>I</b> thought I could do better." ...|$|E

[...] Other influences included Tony Todd, who had appeared as a Hirogen in the fourth season episode [...] "", and Hertzler subsequently compared the costumes that he and Todd wore in their roles, saying [...] "The frustrating thing for me was that Tony got to wear shoulder pads, a huge chest piece, a fabulous helmet.

500|$|In early February {{the marquis}} arrived back unannounced {{at his house}} in Rio de Janeiro, much to the {{surprise}} of his wife. The Viscount of Inhaúma also returned home shortly afterwards, but with his health so compromised that he died a few weeks later. Upon learning of Inhaúma's death, Caxias said: [...] "and the same would have had happened to me, <b>had</b> <b>I</b> not resolved {{to get out of that}} hell." [...] PedroII was greatly disappointed in Caxias, but he was also very aware that the marquis was the person most responsible for the great successes during the war, accomplishments that had come at the cost of years of sacrifice and personal bravery. The Emperor called the marquis to the Imperial Palace, the Paço de São Cristóvão, on 21 February 1869 for a reconciliation.|$|E
