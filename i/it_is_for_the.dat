5|$|In the {{parliamentary}} democracy of India, the ultimate responsibility for running the administration {{rests with the}} elected representatives of the people which are the ministers. But a handful of ministers cannot be expected to deal personally with the manifold problems of modern administration. Thus the ministers lay down the policy and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> civil servants {{to carry out this}} policy.|$|E

50|$|Background: The {{coat of arms}} <b>was</b> {{originally}} approved <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 192d Field Artillery Regiment on 25 March 1927. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 192d Field Artillery Battalion on 16 July 1942. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 192d Artillery Regiment on 15 January 1971. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 192d Field Artillery Regiment on 19 July 1972. <b>The</b> insignia <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 192d Chemical Battalion on 18 November 2003. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 192d Military Police Battalion effective 1 September 2008.|$|R
5|$|Every {{game in the}} SmackDown vs. Raw series used to {{have the}} amount of damage inflicted to the player's chosen superstar, {{measured}} with a meter on the HUD, where a design of a male figure presented the damage. As a move was performed against a superstar, the affected area of the body flashed—the more damage that is done to that specific body part, the more likely <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> superstar to submit. Colors were used to represent the amount of damage done to a specific body area; yellow represented minimal damage, orange represented moderate damage, and red represented maximum damage. This was however taken out of WWE SmackDown vs. Raw 2010. Now {{the only way to}} tell how damaged the opponent is to watch their physical body actions that indicate how hurt they are. The more damage inflicted to opponents, {{the more likely it is}} for them to lose the match. There are four ways to win a match in every game: by pinfall, submission, knockout, countout; alternatively, the match could end in a draw. With the introduction of an on-screen referee in WWF SmackDown! Just Bring It, the ability to win by disqualification was also included.|$|E
5|$|Rita breaks her hip {{while she}} and Brian are having sex. Peter warns Brian that their {{relationship}} will not last much longer {{now that he}} must run errands for her. Brian goes out to pick up medicine for bedridden Rita, but is distracted {{by the sight of}} a group of young women entering a bar. One of them offers to have sex with Brian in the bathroom, after which he returns with her medicine. Realizing that he still loves Rita, he admits his infidelity. However, Rita decides he is far too young for her and breaks off their engagement. A regretful Brian understands that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> best and leaves her.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} terminus of NY42's southern segment {{marks the}} small hamlet of Big Indian, after which Esopus Creek crosses {{for the last}} time, turning south to its source at Winnisook Lake. The road begins a sustained climb {{over the next two}} miles paralleling an Esopus tributary, Birch Creek, up to Pine Hill. At the road to Belleayre Ski Center, in Highmount, the last junction before it leaves the Catskill Park and enters Delaware County, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time signed as a north–south route.|$|E

50|$|Background: The {{distinctive}} unit insignia <b>was</b> originally approved <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 69th Armored Regiment on 7 September 1942. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 69th Tank Battalion on 4 November 1943. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 69th Amphibian Tractor Battalion on 8 January 1946. <b>The</b> insignia <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 69th Medium Tank Battalion on 25 February 1954. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> redesignated <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 69th Armor Regiment on 25 July 1958.|$|R

5|$|When in estrus, the female's scent changes subtly {{and nearby}} males begin pursuit. In addition, a female alerts males {{she is in}} estrus by {{whistling}} through her nose. During mating, the female has the advantage and mating choice. Capybaras mate only in water, and if a female {{does not want to}} mate with a certain male, she either submerges or leaves the water. Dominant males are highly protective of the females, but they usually cannot prevent some of the subordinates from copulating. The larger the group, the harder <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> male to watch all the females. Dominant males secure significantly more matings than each subordinate, but subordinate males, as a class, are responsible for more matings than each dominant male. The lifespan of the capybara's sperm is longer than that of other rodents.|$|E
5|$|While {{there are}} {{resident}} {{populations of the}} yellow-faced honeyeater throughout its range, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part a seasonal, latitudinal, daytime migrant. During the autumn (March to May) it migrates north along the highlands and coastal fringe of eastern Australia to southern Queensland, to return in the spring (August to October) of the same year. The birds commonly move in flocks of 10 to 100 birds, but occasionally in larger groups of up to 1,000 or more birds. The groups can include other species such as the white-naped honeyeater, fuscous honeyeater, noisy friarbird and silvereye. They move in successive flocks {{at a rate of}} up to several thousand birds an hour. Over 100,000 birds were recorded passing Hastings point in New South Wales {{over the course of a}} single day in May 1965. The species is able to detect geomagnetic fields and uses them to navigate while migrating. Experiments where the vertical component of the magnetic field was reversed indicate that the magnetic compass of the yellow-faced honeyeater is based on the inclination of the field lines and not on polarity, meaning they distinguish between the direction of the equator and poles, rather than north and south. While their flight is in one general direction, it is not in a straight line as the flocks stay in vegetated areas, negotiate gaps in the mountain ranges and detour around cities.|$|E
25|$|The Turkish {{language}} {{belongs to}} the Oghuz subfamily of Turkic. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> most part mutually intelligible with the other Oghuz languages, which include Azerbaijani, Gagauz, Turkmen and Urum, and to a varying extent with the other Turkic languages.|$|E

25|$|Traditionally the fluffy tail is {{long and}} erect. In most European {{countries}} and Australia {{it is illegal to}} dock dogs' tails unless <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> dog's benefit (e.g., if the tail is broken). This has resulted in the emergence of a spitz tail in some dogs. Selective breeding should see this change over time and the required slightly curled tail set high on the back again become common.|$|E

Watchmaking is well-established in the canton, with fine mechanics and microchip production being established more recently. Higher educational institutions include Haute école de gestion de Neuchâtel and the University of Neuchâtel.|$|E
25|$|The term {{deforestation}} has {{a meaning}} that covers crossing {{the threshold of}} forest's resilience and losing its ability to return its originally stable state. To recover itself, a forest ecosystem needs suitable interactions among climate conditions and bio-actions, and enough area. In addition, generally, the resilience of a forest system allows recovery from a relatively small scale of damage (such as lightning or landslide) of up to 10 per cent of its area. The larger the scale of damage, the more difficult <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> forest ecosystem to restore and maintain its balance.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{court to}} decide what weight to give the hearsay evidence.

The proper approach would be for a court to consider to what extent the hearsay evidence is, amongst other things, supported by other evidence, the cogency and similarity of supporting instances of hearsay evidence and the cogency and reliability of contradictory evidence supplied by a defendant.|$|E
