40|$|The {{aim of this}} master's {{thesis is}} to <b>elasticize</b> Esterel. Esterel is an {{imperative}} hardware description language (HDL) used to describe reactive systems, and oriented to specify control systems. It belongs {{to the family of}} synchronous languages, and it allows to describe causality, concurrency and interruptions. Elastic circuits preserve a protocol that makes it possible for the circuit to be latency-insensitive. Besides, elastic circuits are easy to implement and can be synthesized automatically. The goal of the thesis is to provide an automatic synthesis method of elastic circuits from Esterel specifications. At the semantic level, it is proven that the generated elastic circuits are functionally equivalent to the conventional circuits generated using Esterel V 7 compiler...|$|R
500|$|As the {{swimsuit}} was evolving, the underwear {{started to}} change. Between 1900 and 1940, swimsuit lengths followed {{the changes in}} underwear designs. In the 1920s women started discarding the corset, while the Cadole company of Paris started developing something they called the [...] "breast girdle". During the Great Depression, panties and bras became softly constructed and were made of various <b>elasticized</b> yarns making underwear fit like a second skin. By 1930s underwear styles for {{both women and men}} were influenced by the new brief models of swimwear from Europe. Although the waistband was still above the navel, the leg openings of the panty brief were cut in an arc to rise from the crotch to the hip joint. The brief served as a template for most all variations of panties {{for the rest of the}} century. Warner standardized the concept of Cup size in 1935. The first underwire bra was developed in 1938. Beginning in the late thirties skants, a type of skanty men's briefs, were introduced, featuring very high-cut leg openings and a lower rise to the waistband. Howard Hughes designed a push-up bra to be worn by Jane Russell in The Outlaw in 1943, although Russell stated in interviews that she never wore the 'contraption'. In 1950 Maidenform introduced the first official bust enhancing bra.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Latency {{insensitivity}} is {{a promising}} design paradigm in the nanometer era {{since it has}} potential benefits of increased modularity and robustness to variations. Synchronous elasticization is one approach (among others) of transforming an ordinary clocked circuit into a latency insensitive design. This paper presents practical considerations of <b>elasticizing</b> reconvergent fanouts. It also investigates the suitability of previously published {{as well as new}} join and fork implementations for usage in the elastic control network. We demonstrate that elasticization comes at a cost. Measurements of a MiniMIPS processor fabricated in a 0. 5 µm node show that elasticization results in area and dynamic and idle power penalties of 29 %, 13 % and 58. 3 %, respectively, without any loss in performance. These measurements do not exploit the capability of pipeline bubbles that occur if one needs to have unpredictable interface latency, or to insert extra bubbles into a pipeline due to wire delays. We finally show the architectural performance advantage of eager over lazy protocols in the presence of bubbles in the MiniMIPS...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the demand of food and nonfood commodities among urban and rural households. To this aim, an appropriate functional form and approximation index were established. Then, Deaton and Mulbaer Iterative (DMI) approach as a linear approximation of Almost Ideal Demand System was used. The study horizon was also 1362 - 1383 (1983 - 2004). The findings revealed that for urban households housing, fuel, power and furniture, household operations and entertainment, education and food, beverages, tobacco are considered necessary. While clothing, footwear and medical care and transport, communication and other goods are consumed as superior commodities. For urban households, a weak complementary and substitution relation among selected commodities was recognized. In the case of rural households clothing, footwear and food, beverages, tobacco were revealed to be necessary, while housing, fuel, power and medical care and entertainment, education were found superior. For the rural households only furniture and house operation was found elastic. The compensated and uncompensated self price <b>elasticizes</b> were similar regarding the sign and magnitude coefficients for rural and urban households...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1984 Product {{formulation}} and {{in vitro}} dissolution characteristics of sustained-release chewable tablet dosage forms {{are presented in}} chapter one of this thesis. In vivo single dose and multiple dose studies of two sustained-release formulations {{as well as one}} conventional dyphylline formulation are described in chapter two. The pharmacokinetics of dyphylline following inhalation is shown in chapter three. Phase-separation coacervation microencapsulation and polymer matrix methods with five variables (ratio of drug to polymer material, wall sealants, tabletting pressure, particle size and <b>elasticizing</b> agent) have been investigated for making new dyphylline dosage forms. There is 307 in vitro dyphylline released within the first hour from microencapsulated formulation and 507 in vitro dyphylline released within the first hour from a polymer matrix formulation. The remaining dyphylline in both formulations was released very slowly over 24 hours. This release pattern may be clinically useful. These formulations were chosen along with the conventional dyphylline tablet for determining in vivo relative bioavailability of these sustained-release dyphylline chewable tablet dosage forms in swine. The sustained-release microencapsulated formulation is a good formulation since it has a slow rate of absorption and has an equal extent of bioavailability with the commercial product. The steady-state concentrations following multiple-dosing studies for the microencapsulated product were maintained at about 7 - 8 ug/ml for one pig and above 10 ug/ml for two other pigs.

40|$|Hybrid {{deployable}} radio antennas and reflectors of {{a proposed}} type would feature rigid narrower apertures plus wider adjoining apertures comprising reflective surfaces supported by open-cell polymeric foam structures (see figure). The open-cell foam structure of such an antenna would be compressed for compact stowage during transport. To initiate deployment of the antenna, the foam structure would simply be released from its stowage mechanical restraint. The elasticity of the foam would drive {{the expansion of the}} foam structure to its full size and shape. There are several alternatives for fabricating a reflective surface supported by a polymeric foam structure. One approach would be to coat the foam with a metal. Another approach would be to attach a metal film or a metal-coated polymeric membrane to the foam. Yet another approach would be to attach a metal mesh to the foam. The hybrid antenna design and deployment concept as proposed offers significant advantages over other concepts for deployable antennas: 1) In the unlikely event of failure to deploy, the rigid narrow portion of the antenna would still function, providing a minimum level of assured performance. In contrast, most other concepts for deploying a large antenna from compact stowage are of an "all or nothing" nature: the antenna is not useful at all until and unless it is fully deployed. 2) Stowage and deployment would not depend on complex mechanisms or actuators, nor would it involve the use of inflatable structures. Therefore, relative to antennas deployed by use of mechanisms, actuators, or inflation systems, this antenna could be lighter, cheaper, amenable to stowage in a smaller volume, and more reliable. An open-cell polymeric (e. g., polyurethane) foam offers several advantages for use as a compressible/expandable structural material to support a large antenna or reflector aperture. A few of these advantages are the following: 3) The open cellular structure is amenable to compression to a very small volume - typically to 1 / 20 of its full size in one dimension. 4) At a temperature above its glass-transition temperature (T(sub g)), the foam strongly damps vibrations. Even at a temperature below T(sub g), the damping should exceed that of other materials. 5) In its macroscopic mechanical properties, an open-cell foam is isotropic. This isotropy facilitates computational modeling of antenna structures. 6) Through chemical formulation, the T(sub g) of an open-cell polyurethane foam can be set at a desired value between about - 100 and about 0 C. Depending on the application, {{it may or may not}} be necessary to rigidify a foam structure after deployment. If rigidification is necessary, then the T(sub g) of the foam can be tailored to exceed the temperature of the deployment environment, in conjunction with providing a heater to <b>elasticize</b> the foam for deployment. Once deployed, the foam would become rigidified by cooling to below T(sub g). 7) Techniques for molding or machining polymeric foams (especially including open-cell polyurethane foams) to desired sizes and shapes are well developed...|$|R

50|$|The {{shaft of}} a fashion boot can be fitted (i.e. {{following}} {{the curve of}} the wearer’s calf), straight-legged, or loose-fitting (or “slouchy”).

Compression folds around the ankle allow for movement of the foot.
