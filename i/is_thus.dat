5|$|A field <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> a {{fundamental}} algebraic structure, which {{is widely used}} in algebra, number theory and many other areas of mathematics.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of 613 parsecs, Kepler-11d has an apparent magnitude of 14.2. It <b>is,</b> <b>thus,</b> not visible with the naked eye.|$|E

60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> in sundry of {{the cases}} we have quoted as at {{variance}} with M. Comte's doctrine. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> with the application of Huyghens's optical discovery to astronomical observation by Galileo. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> with {{the application of the}} isochronism of the pendulum to the making of instruments for measuring intervals, astronomical and other. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the discovery that the refraction and dispersion of light did not follow the same law of variation, affected both astronomy and physiology by giving us achromatic telescopes and microscopes. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when Bradley's discovery of the aberration of light enabled him to make the first step towards ascertaining the motions of the stars. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when Cavendish's torsion-balance experiment determined the specific gravity of the earth, and so gave a datum for calculating the specific gravities of the sun and planets. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when tables of atmospheric refraction enabled observers to write down the real places of the heavenly bodies instead of their apparent places. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the discovery of the different expansibilities of metals by heat, gave us the means of correcting our chronometrical measurements of astronomical periods. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the lines of the prismatic spectrum were used to distinguish the heavenly bodies that are of like nature with the sun from those which are not. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when, as recently, an electro-telegraphic instrument was invented for the more accurate registration of meridional transits. It <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> when the difference in the rates of a clock at the equator, and nearer the poles, gave data for calculating the oblateness of the earth, and accounting for the precession of the equinoxes. It was thus--but it is needless to continue.|$|R
60|$|This {{was true}} enough; {{and now my}} {{attention}} <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> directed, and my senses <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> aided, I confess I did discover certain proofs of footsteps, that would, otherwise, have baffled my most serious search.|$|R
500|$|The [...] "State Shinto" [...] term <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> used to categorize, and abolish, Imperial Japanese {{practices}} that relied on Shinto to support nationalistic ideology. By refusing to ban Shinto practices outright, Japan's post-war constitution <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> able to preserve full Freedom of Religion.|$|R
5|$|Aristotle's {{theory has}} some symmetry, as semen {{movements}} carry maleness while the menses carry femaleness. If the semen is {{hot enough to}} overpower the cold menses, the child will be a boy; {{but if it is}} too cold to do this, the child will be a girl. Inheritance <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> particulate (definitely one trait or another), as in Mendelian genetics, unlike the Hippocratic model which was continuous and blending.|$|E
5|$|Completed in {{the context}} of the Yugoslav wars, the film {{constitutes}} an investigation into the consequences of xenophobia and state-sanctioned repression, as well as an indictment of a failure in reaching out. It <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> often described as a verdict on the history of Romania, as well as on problems facing the Balkans at large, and occasionally described as a warning that violence could also erupt in a purely Romanian context.|$|E
5|$|HAT-P-33b has an orbital {{inclination}} of 86.7º {{as seen from}} Earth. The planet <b>is,</b> <b>thus,</b> almost edge-on when seen from Earth. The planet has been observed to transit its host star.|$|E

5|$|In Stage four (authority {{and social}} order {{obedience}} driven), {{it is important}} to obey laws, dictums, and social conventions because of their importance in maintaining a functioning society. Moral reasoning in stage four <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> beyond the need for individual approval exhibited in stage three. A central ideal or ideals often prescribe what is right and wrong. If one person violates a law, perhaps everyone would—thus there is an obligation and a duty to uphold laws and rules. When someone does violate a law, it is morally wrong; culpability <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> a significant factor in this stage as it separates the bad domains from the good ones. Most active members of society remain at stage four, where morality is still predominantly dictated by an outside force.|$|E
5|$|In the 1630s, {{the texts}} of these annals were {{compiled}} into a single, enormous compendium, known as the Annals of the Four Masters. In the process, the authors sometimes modified the chronology and content {{of some of the}} materials, and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> chronologically untrustworthy. However, it is recognised that they saved for posterity material that would otherwise have been lost, and the entry contains the longest annalistic account of the battle.|$|E
5|$|Like Icelandic and Faroese, the {{development}} of English on the British Isles isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> not mutually intelligible with any continental Germanic language, differing in vocabulary, syntax, and phonology, although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.|$|E

5|$|Many modern insect genera {{developed}} during the Cenozoic. Insects from this period on are often found preserved in amber, often in perfect condition. The body plan, or morphology, of such specimens <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> easily compared with modern species. The study of fossilized insects is called paleoentomology.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{bromides}} of the pre-transition metals (groups 1, 2, and 3, {{along with}} the lanthanides and actinides in the +2 and +3 oxidation states) are mostly ionic, while nonmetals tend to form covalent molecular bromides, as do metals in high oxidation states from +3 and above. Silver bromide is very insoluble in water and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> often used as a qualitative test for bromine.|$|E
5|$|Praseodymium {{has only}} one stable and {{naturally}} occurring isotope, 141Pr. It <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> a mononuclidic element, and its standard atomic weight can be determined with high precision. This isotope has 82 neutrons, a magic number that confers additional stability. This isotope is produced in stars through the s- and r-processes (slow and rapid neutron capture, respectively).|$|E

5|$|Some {{research}} suggests that cranberry (juice or capsules) may decrease the number of UTIs in those with frequent infections. A Cochrane review concluded that the benefit, if it exists, is small. Long-term tolerance is also an issue with gastrointestinal upset occurring in more than 30%. Cranberry juice <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> not currently recommended for this indication. As of 2015, probiotics require further study {{to determine if they}} are beneficial.|$|E
5|$|Some sources {{state that}} in {{contrast}} to the glans penis, the clitoral glans lacks smooth muscle within its fibrovascular cap and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> differentiated from the erectile tissues of the clitoris and bulbs; additionally, bulb size varies and may be dependent on age and estrogenization. Though the bulbs are considered the equivalent of the male spongiosum, they do not completely encircle the urethra.|$|E
5|$|The {{definition}} of the two sets <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> a historic one. Out of pure coincidence, the phoneme inventory of present-day colloquial Sinhala is such that yet again the śuddha alphabet suffices as a good representation of the sounds.|$|E
50|$|The {{convictions}} of McNally and Gray <b>were</b> <b>thus</b> reversed.|$|R
50|$|Linear gingival {{erythema}} (LGE) is a periodontal disorder diagnosed {{based on}} distinct clinical characteristics. It was originally thought that LGE was directly associated with HIV, and it <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> called HIV-associated gingivitis (HIV-G). Later research confirmed that LGE also occurs in HIV negative immunocompromised patients, and it <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> renamed.|$|R

5|$|The {{hospital}} is accessible by public transport via bus services operating {{from the main}} local towns. A shuttle bus used to but no longer runs every 20 minutes from Larbert railway station, (it was free for passengers with a train ticket); the station <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> now a 25-minute walk away from Larbert train station.|$|E
5|$|The second {{ionisation}} {{energy of}} the alkali metals {{is much higher than}} the first as the second-most loosely held electron is part of a fully filled electron shell and <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> difficult to remove.|$|E
5|$|There <b>is</b> <b>thus</b> {{a causal}} chain which transmits {{information}} from a sense organ to an organ capable of making decisions, and onwards to a motor organ. In this respect, the model is analogous to a modern understanding of information processing such as in sensory-motor coupling.|$|E

50|$|He first {{stood as}} a {{councillor}} for CCC in 1881 in the South-west Ward. The other candidate, James Tait, formally {{withdrew from the}} election on 5 September, and Louisson <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> declared elected unopposed. Back then, each ward was represented by three councillors, {{and one of the}} councillors retired per year. Louisson <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> due to retire in 1884. On 4 September of that year, Louisson was the only candidate nominated in the South-west Ward, and he <b>was</b> <b>thus</b> declared elected. He retired {{at the end of the}} term in September 1887 and did not stand for re-election.|$|R
