The campaign was coordinated by the Environmental Protection Agency of Aosta Valley (ARPA Valle d'Aosta) and took place in Saint-Christophe (45. 8 ° N, 7. 4 ° E, 570 m a. s. l.), in the Alpine region, from 8 to 23 June 2010. It involved 8 institutions, 10 broadband radiometers, 2 filter radiometers and 2 spectroradiometers. Synchronized measurements of downward global solar UV irradiance at the ground were collected and the raw series were then individually processed by the respective operators on the base of their own procedures and calibration data. A radiative transfer model was successfully applied as an interpretative tool. The input parameters and output results are described in detail. The comparison was performed in terms of <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> and integrated UV-A irradiance against a well-calibrated double monochromator spectroradiometer as reference. An improved algorithm for comparing broadband data and spectra has been developed and is discussed in detail. For some instruments, we found average deviations ranging from − 16 % up to 20 % relative to the reference and diurnal variations as large as 15 % even in clear days. Remarkable deviations were found for the instruments calibrated in the manufacturers' facilities and never involved in field intercomparison.

Periodic assessment of the solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure risk to employees who work outdoors for {{all or part of}} the day. 2. The introduction and maintenance of sun protective control measures in line with occupational hazard controls including: a. Engineering controls such as providing shade; b. Administrative controls such as rescheduling outdoor work tasks and using the SunSmart UV Alert * to inform workers when to use sun protection; and c. Personal protective equipment such as the provision and use of sun protective work clothing, sun protective hats, SPF 30 + sunscreen and sunglasses. 3. Providing education and training for all outdoor employees, safety officers, health and safety representatives, supervisors and managers to create awareness on how to work safely in the sun and encourage workers to examine their own skin. 4. Documenting the sun protection program, including control measures, in a written policy. Employers and employees should work together to develop this policy, which should include a process to monitor compliance. *The SunSmart UV Alert is based on the <b>Global</b> <b>Solar</b> <b>UV</b> <b>Index,</b> a rating system adopted from the World Health Organisation 1. It indicates the amount of solar UVR reaching the earth’s surface. The higher the number, the greater the potential for skin damage. The Bureau of Meteorology issues the SunSmart UV Alert when the UV Index is forecast to reach 3 or above. At 3 and above the level of solar UVR is strong enough to damage the skin, so workers need to use sun protection. Note: This statement is a summary of key sun protection information for workplaces.

40|$|The {{reliable}} quantification of ultraviolet (UV) radiation at the earth's surface requires {{accurate measurements}} of spectral <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> irradiance {{in order to}} determine the UV exposure to human skin and to understand long-term trends in this parameter. Array spectroradiometers (ASRMs) are small, light, robust and cost-effective instruments, and are increasingly used for spectral irradiance measurements. Within the European EMRP ENV 03 project “Solar UV”, new devices, guidelines and characterization methods have been developed to improve <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> measurements with ASRMs, and support to the end user community has been provided. In order to assess the quality of 14 end user ASRMs, a <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> intercomparison was held on the measurement platform of the World Radiation Center (PMOD/WRC) in Davos, Switzerland, from 10 to 17  July  2014. The results of the blind intercomparison revealed that ASRMs, currently used for <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> measurements, show a large variation in the quality of their <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> measurements. Most of the instruments overestimate the erythema-weighted <b>UV</b> <b>index</b> – in particular at large solar zenith angles – due to stray light contribution in the UV-B range. The spectral analysis of <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> irradiance further supported the finding that the uncertainties in the UV-B range are very large due to stray light contribution in this wavelength range. In summary, the <b>UV</b> <b>index</b> may be detected by some commercially available ASRMs within 5  % compared to the world reference spectroradiometer, if well characterized and calibrated, but only for a limited range of solar zenith angles.

Before starting the intensive measurements, a 2 -day intercomparison was performed at each site with a traveling spectrophotometer to ensure consistency and comparability between the instruments and their measurements during the period of the study. The collected data were used to investigate the variability of solar ultraviolet irradiances at high and middle latitudes during a period of considerably varying ozone levels. The ratio of the UV erythemal irradiance to UVA irradiance was used to exclude the interference of clouds and other wavelength independent factors.

Methods: In a 12 month cluster {{randomised controlled trial}} (RCT) of sunlight exposure and calcium, the main outcomes were falls’ rate and changes in 25 OHD. UVR dose was estimated from ambient <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> data. Multiple linear regression {{was used to test}} if UVR dose predicted vitamin D response. Adherence factors were identified through semi-structured interviews and focus groups. Outdoor spaces of residential facilities were assessed. Results: Adherence to sunlight exposure was low and there was no significant decrease in falls’ risk or increase in 25 OHD except in those with higher attendance rates. The significant predictors of 25 OHD at six months were UVR exposures in spring-summer and autumn-winter, and baseline vitamin D. Poor health, physical constraints and lack of autonomy were barriers to attendance. Design features of outdoor spaces hindered their use. Conclusion: Older people have the capacity to produce vitamin D from natural sunlight UVR, but vitamin D response was minimal due to poor adherence. Safe sun exposure can be encouraged in this population by addressing the barriers identified in this study. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

In summer, TOMS <b>UV</b> <b>index</b> climatology values are from 10 to 30 % higher than those derived from <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> radiation and other parameters.

40|$|Brewer spectrophotometers {{are widely}} used {{instruments}} which perform spectral measurements of the direct, the scattered and the <b>global</b> <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> irradiance. By processing these measurements a variety of secondary products can be derived such as the total columns of ozone (TOC), sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide and aerosol optical properties. Estimating and limiting the uncertainties of the final products is of critical importance. High-quality data {{have a lot of}} applications and can provide accurate estimations of trends. The dead time is specific for each instrument and improper correction of the raw data for its effect may lead to important errors in the final products. The dead time value may change with time and, with the currently used methodology, it cannot always be determined accurately. For specific cases, such as for low ozone slant columns and high intensities of the direct solar irradiance, the error in the retrieved TOC, due to a 10  ns change in the dead time from its value in use, is found to be up to 5  %. The error in the calculation of UV irradiance can be as high as 12  % near the maximum operational limit of light intensities. While in the existing documentation it is indicated that the dead time effects are important when the error in the used value is greater than 2  ns, we found that for single-monochromator Brewers a 2  ns error in the dead time may lead to errors above the limit of 1  % in the calculation of TOC; thus the tolerance limit should be lowered. A new routine for the determination of the dead time from direct solar irradiance measurements has been created and tested and a validation of the operational algorithm has been performed. Additionally, new methods for the estimation and the validation of the dead time have been developed and are analytically described. Therefore, the present study, in addition to highlighting the importance of the dead time for the processing of Brewer data sets, also provides useful information for their quality control and re-evaluation...|$|R

40|$|INTRODUCTION <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> is an {{indicator}} of human exposure to <b>solar</b> ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> rays. The numerical values of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> range from 1 - 11 and above. There are three levels of protection against UV radiation; low values of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> - protection is not required, medium values of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> - protection is recommended and high values of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> - protection is obligatory. The value of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> primarily depends on the elevation {{of the sun and}} total ozone column. OBJECTIVE The aim of the study is to determine the intervals of possible maximal annual values of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> in Serbia {{in order to determine the}} necessary level of protection in a simple manner. METHOD For maximal and minimal expected values of total column ozone and for maximal elevation of the sun, the value of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> was determined for each month in the Northern and Southern parts of Serbia. These values were compared with the forecast of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index.</b> RESULTS Maximal clear sky values of the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> in Serbia for altitudes up to 500 m in May, June, July and August can be 9 or even 10, and not less than 5 or 6.

Cloud cover is taken into account by retrieving cloud optical depth from the channel 1 reflectance of the third Advanced Very High-Resolution Ra-diometer (AVHRR/ 3) instrument aboard both Metop in the morning orbit and Polar Orbiting Environmental Satellites (POES) of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Admin-istration (NOAA) in the afternoon orbit. In addition, more overpasses are used at high latitudes where the swaths of consecutive orbits overlap. The input satellite data are re-ceived from EUMETSAT’s Multicast Distribution System (EUMETCast). The surface UV product includes daily max-imum dose rates and integrated daily doses with different bi-ological weighting functions, integrated ultraviolet B (UVB) and ultraviolet A (UVA) radiation, <b>solar</b> noon <b>UV</b> <b>index</b> and daily maximum photolysis frequencies of ozone and nitro-gen dioxide at the surface level. The quantities are computed in a 0. 5 ◦ × 0. 5 ◦ regular latitude–longitude grid and stored as daily files in the hierarchical data format (HDF 5) within 2 weeks from sensing. The product files are archived in the O 3 M SAF distributed archive and can be ordered via the EU-METSAT Data Centre. ...|$|R
40|$|The climatic, {{vegetation}} and soil characteristics of several tropical montane cloud forests in southern Thailand were investigated. Automatic weather stations were installed at three study sites: Mt. Nom cloud forest, Dadfa cloud forest and Mt. Nan Headquarters. HOBO U 23 Pro V 2 Temperature/Relative Humidity data loggers along the Mt. Nom elevational transect at five sites (500, 700, 900, 1, 100 and 1, 300 m) were installed for measuring air temperature and relative humidity. Soil samples along the Mt. Nom elevational transect {{at the same}} five sites were collected and soil pH, soil moisture and organic content were measured in the laboratory. Tree height, shrub width, leaf thickness, leaf area and epiphyte cover of every Lithocarpus bennettii (Miq.) Rehd. tree found along the Mt. Nom cloud forest elevational transect starting at 313 m and ending at 1, 274 m were measured. Of the three sites, Mt. Nom cloud forest had the lowest air temperature, dew point, heat index, solar radiation, <b>solar</b> energy and <b>UV</b> <b>index.</b> Soil moisture and soil organic content increased with increasing elevation. The soil pH ranged from 3. 6 to 4. 3 which indicated that soil at Mt. Nom is high acidic. </strong...|$|R
40|$|Whether the Sun has {{significantly}} influenced the climate {{during the last}} century has been under extensive debates for almost two decades. Since the solar irradiance varies very little in a solar cycle, it is puzzling that some geophysical parameters show proportionally large variations which appear to be responding to the solar cycles. For example, variation in low altitude clouds is shown correlated with solar cycle, and the onset of Forbush decrease is shown correlated with {{the reduction of the}} vorticity area index. A possible sun-climate connection is that galactic cosmic rays modulated by solar activities influence cloud formation. In this paper, we apply wavelet transform to satellite and surface data to examine this hypothesis. Data analyzed include the time series for <b>solar</b> irradiance, sunspots, <b>UV</b> <b>index,</b> temperature, cloud coverage, and neutron counter measurements. The interactions among the elements in the Earth System under the external and internal forcings give out very complex signals. The periodicity of the forcings or signals could range widely. Since wavelet transforms can analyze multi-scale phenomena that are both localized in frequency and time, it is a very useful technique for detecting, understanding and monitoring climate changes...|$|R
40|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} (UV) contributes Little to {{the solar}} spectrum; however, {{it is very}} important {{as a result of its}} strong biological action. Experimental measurements of global and UV radiation were carried out at different altitude stations in Costa Rica (Heredia 1. 050 m, Volcán Irazú 3. 400 m, Monte Verde de Siquirres 34 m, Limón 5 m and San Pablo de Turrubares 375 m). The global and UV radiometers were interfaced to a data acquisition system (data logger) in order to read the output every 30 sec during the solar day. In order to determine and analyze peaks of maximum and minimum hourly-averaged radiation in clear sky conditions, <b>global</b> and <b>Uv</b> <b>solar</b> radiation data were processed and measured within the period February 1991 to January 1993 (2 years) in Heredia. Data for the other stations were processed using <b>global</b> and <b>UV</b> <b>solar</b> radiation for several consecutive days in February, March and April of 1992. Hourly and daily variations of <b>global</b> and ultraviolet <b>solar</b> radiation with altitude were also analyzed.   Over a two years period in Heredia the computed annual means for the global UV radiation were 0. 215 Kwh/m 2, with a maximum in march of 0. 290 Kwh/m 2 and a minimum in October of 0. 172 Kwh/m 2   The hourly percentage of the quotient between ultraviolet Iv and the global radiation Ig (Iv/Ig) x 100 varies from a maximum of 4. 7 % to a minimum of 3. 1 % in Limón, and from a maximum of 5. 2 % to a minimum of 3. 1 % at Volcán Irazú. For all stations it is found an increase of (Iv/Ig) x 100 due to increasing cloudiness,  consistent with the known fact that clouds absorb more energy in the near infrared than in the ultraviolet region of the solar spectrum. A similar effect occurs at low solar altitude. Employing the least-square linear regression  analysis an estimated empirical function relating global radiation to ultraviolet radiation was obtained...|$|R
40|$|Observational {{detection}} of upper stratospheric ozone responses to 27 -day <b>solar</b> ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> variations is often inhibited by larger, dynamically induced ozone variations, which {{result mainly from}} the temperature dependence of reaction rates controlling the ozone balance. Here we show that partial correlation coefficients of <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> and tropical upper stratospheric ozone (1 – 5 hPa) with the temperature effect removed are larger (07 – 0. 8) than are total correlation coefficients of ozone and <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> (0. 4 – 0. 6). The phase lag of ozone relative to <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> is also increased, and the maximum ozone-UV correlation is obtained at higher altitudes, as compared with correlation analyses using ozone and <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> data alone. Assuming that temperature variations are not forced by <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> variations, the ozone sensitivity to <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> and temperature can be calculated using a linear multiple regression model. The ozone sensitivity to <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> is generally independent of time periods used for the analysis. However, {{the magnitude of the}} ozone sensitivity to temperature at 1 – 2 hPa increased significantly from solar cycle 21 to solar cycle 22, possibly reflecting long-term changes in the composition of the upper stratosphere...|$|R
40|$|The Nimbus- 7 TOMS version 6 data, {{corrected}} for {{the instrument}} degradation, are analyzed to delineate the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> related changes in total ozone (TOZ) against background signals of dynamical origin. It is {{shown that the}} <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> related change in TOZ over a solar cycle is about 1. 5 percent that {{may be attributed to}} about 6 percent change in the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> flux near 200 nm. This estimate is also consistent with the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> related changes in TOZ over a time scale of a solar rotation. In the solar rotation case, ozone lags the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> by 3 - 4 days and its sensitivity to <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> change is a factor of 2 - 3 less than for the solar cycle case. Both these effects are attributed to chemical time constants in the lower stratosphere that are comparable to the period of a solar rotation...|$|R
40|$|The {{possible}} {{ramifications of}} climate change include the influence it has upon the amount of cloud cover in the atmosphere. Clouds cause significant variation in the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation reaching the earth’s surface and in turn the amount incident on ecosystems. The consequences of changes in <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation delivered to ecosystems due to climate change may be significant and should be investigated. Plants {{are an integral part}} of the world wide ecological balance, and research has shown they are affected by variations in <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation. Therefore research into the influence of <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation on plants is of particular significance. However, this requires a means of obtaining detailed information on the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation received by plants. This research describes a newly developed dosimetric technique employed to gather information on <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation incident to the leaves of plants in combination with the measurement of spectral irradiances in order to provide an accurate method of collecting detailed information on the <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> radiation affecting the canopy and lower leaf layers of individual plants.

40|$|International audienceAn SUV- 150 B {{spectroradiometer}} {{for measuring}} <b>solar</b> ultraviolet (<b>UV)</b> irradiance was installed at Summit, Greenland, in August 2004. Here we compare the initial {{data from this}} new location with similar measurements from Barrow, Alaska and South Pole. Measurements of irradiance at 345 nm performed at equivalent solar zenith angles (SZAs) are almost identical at Summit and South Pole. The good agreement can be explained with the similar location of the two sites on high-altitude ice caps with high surface albedo. Clouds have little impact at both sites, but can reduce irradiance at Barrow by more than 75 %. Clear-sky measurements at Barrow are smaller than at Summit by 14 % in spring and 36 % in summer, mostly {{due to differences in}} surface albedo and altitude. Comparisons with model calculations indicate that aerosols can reduce clear-sky irradiance at 345 nm by 4 ? 6 %; aerosol influence is largest in April. Differences in total ozone at the three sites have a large influence on the <b>UV</b> <b>Index.</b> At South Pole, the <b>UV</b> <b>Index</b> is on average 20 ? 80 % larger during the ozone hole period than between January and March. At Summit, total ozone peaks in April and <b>UV</b> <b>Indices</b> in spring are on average 10 ? 25 % smaller than in the summer. Maximum <b>UV</b> <b>Indices</b> ever observed at Summit and South Pole are 6. 7 and 4. 0, respectively. The larger value at Summit is due to the site's lower latitude. For comparable SZAs, average <b>UV</b> <b>Indices</b> measured during October and November at South Pole are 1. 9 ? 2. 4 times larger than measurements during March and April at Summit. Average <b>UV</b> <b>Indices</b> at Summit are over 50 % greater than at Barrow because of the larger cloud influence at Barrow...|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{there is}} a major gap in the {{knowledge}} that is needed in order to optimise the beneficial effects related to ultraviolet (UV) radiation for vitamin D 3 synthesis (UVD 3) compared to reducing the biologically damaging overexposure to UV radiation. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the use of diffuse (radiation that is scattered from all directions) UV to optimise UVD 3 exposures and maximize the reduction of UVA exposures. <b>Global</b> and diffuse <b>solar</b> <b>UV</b> spectral data have each been collected in ten minute intervals during the Southern Hemisphere late spring and summer from 1 November 2006 to 28 February 2007. For a solar zenith angle (SZA) of approximately 5 o, the observed maximum UVD 3 irradiances were 0. 80 W/m 2 and 0. 46 W/m 2, for global and diffuse UV respectively. While the observed maximum UVA irradiances were 79. 0 W/m 2 and 36. 2 W/m 2, for global and diffuse UV respectively. For diffuse UV, the maximum ratio of vitamin D 3 to UVA was 1. 75 % at a SZA of approximately 10 o, whereas the maximum ratio for global UV was 1. 27 % at 10 o. For SZAs of 25 o and less, more UV radiation is contributed toward vitamin D 3 than toward UVA exposure by utilising diffuse UV compared to global UV...|$|R
