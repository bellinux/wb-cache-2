5|$|However, Convair {{arranged}} {{to use the}} remaining contract funding to launch three of the rockets, which were renamed RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The tests took place at White Sands Proving Grounds. The three tests took place on 13 July 1947, 27 September, and 2 December. These tests validated the concept of using <b>gimballed</b> engines for propulsion and guidance.|$|E
5|$|The RTV-A-2 Hiroc (high-altitude rocket) was the United States' {{first attempt}} at an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM). The project was initially under the name MX-774, however the project was canceled in 1947, and leftover funds were used to build and launch three missiles, which were renamed to RTV-A-2 Hiroc. The design included several innovations; the <b>gimballed</b> engine provided guidance control, the internal gas pressure was used to support the airframe and the nose cap was separable. All of these concepts were later used on the Atlas missile.|$|E
5|$|The nose cone, which {{contained}} the ordnance that would impact the target, would {{separate from the}} rocket booster. This made the rocket lighter as only the nose cone and its ordnance {{had to be able}} to survive re-entry, rather than the rocket. The unique innovations of the Hiroc missiles, such as the <b>gimballed</b> engines, and the internally supported frame, would go on to inspire the Atlas rockets. Several things changed however, such as the aluminum used for the missiles skin of the Hiroc, was switched out for stainless steel in the Atlas, because stainless steel had a higher melting point. The engines of the Atlas missiles were also much stronger, generating a total of 150,000 pounds-force (667,000 Newtons), compared to the Hiroc's total of 8,000 pounds-force (35,585 Newtons).|$|E

50|$|While {{only two}} {{specific}} orientations produce exact <b>gimbal</b> lock, practical mechanical <b>gimbals</b> encounter difficulties near those orientations. When {{a set of}} <b>gimbals</b> {{is close to the}} locked configuration, small rotations of the <b>gimbal</b> platform require large motions of the surrounding <b>gimbals.</b> Although the ratio is infinite only at the point of <b>gimbal</b> lock, the practical speed and acceleration limits of the <b>gimbals</b> limit the motion of the platform close to that point.|$|R
25|$|A {{gyroscope}} is a wheel {{mounted in}} two or three <b>gimbals,</b> which are a pivoted supports that allow the rotation of the wheel about a single axis. A set of three <b>gimbals,</b> one mounted on the other with orthogonal pivot axes, may be used to allow a wheel mounted on the innermost <b>gimbal</b> to have an orientation remaining independent of the orientation, in space, of its support. In the case of a gyroscope with two <b>gimbals,</b> the outer <b>gimbal,</b> which is the gyroscope frame, is mounted so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane determined by the support. This outer <b>gimbal</b> possesses one degree of rotational freedom and its axis possesses none. The inner <b>gimbal</b> is mounted in the gyroscope frame (outer <b>gimbal)</b> so as to pivot about an axis in its own plane that is always perpendicular to the pivotal axis of the gyroscope frame (outer <b>gimbal).</b> This inner <b>gimbal</b> has two degrees of rotational freedom.|$|R

The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the <b>gimballed</b> turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.|$|E

Pipes may need to be uncoupled from the plant to prevent storm damage. As an alternative to a warm-water pipe, surface water can be drawn directly into the platform; however, it is necessary to prevent the intake flow from being damaged or interrupted during violent motions caused by heavy seas.|$|E
