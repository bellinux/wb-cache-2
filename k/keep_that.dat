5|$|Between 1087 and 1089, Rufus asked Gundulf, Bishop of Rochester, {{to build}} a new stone castle at Rochester. He {{established}} the current extent of the castle. Though much altered through the centuries, some parts of Gundulf's work survive. In 1127 King HenryI granted the castle to the Archbishop of Canterbury in perpetuity. William de Corbeil built the massive <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> still dominates the castle today. Throughout the 12thcentury the castle remained in the custody of the archbishops.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of Persian {{imperial}} rule in the region (c. 550–330 BCE), the Qedarites exercised control over the desert areas bordering Egypt and Israel and the traffic related to Arabian incense trade upon which Gaza depended. Herodotus (c. 484–425 BCE) writes of {{their presence in the}} northern Sinai near the Egyptian border where they may have been engaged by the Achaemenids, the Persian imperial authorities, to <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> border secure as well as their control of the city of Gaza.|$|E
5|$|Tegetthoff {{was laid}} down in 1876 at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino {{shipyard}} in Trieste. The ship was launched in 1878, and completed in 1881. She conducted her sea trials in October of that year, and was finally ready for commissioning in September 1882; Kaiser Franz Joseph attended the commissioning of the ship in Pola. Financial difficulties had again delayed the ship's completion; the parliament finally voted to allocate funds to finish the ship in November 1881. At the time, she was {{the largest and most}} powerful ship in the Austro-Hungarian fleet, and she would <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> distinction until {{after the turn of the}} century. She was, nevertheless, a political compromise, and was much smaller than foreign casemate ships, particularly British and French vessels.|$|E

5|$|The Princess Theatre opened as a single-screen cinema on March 8, 1915 to rave reviews. It {{had cost}} McKernan CDN$75,000 {{and had taken}} 10 months to build, longer than expected. The theatre opened with 660 seats and the largest live {{performance}} stage in a cinema west of Winnipeg. It {{was at the time}} the only cinema on Edmonton’s south side, and would <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> title until the opening of the Garneau Theatre in 1940. Opening night was a benefit concert for The Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire, associated with the 19th Alberta Dragoons, B Squad. The program proudly included newsreels “featuring actual war scenes”. In audience were the Lt. Governor and Mayor W.T. Henry. The house’s first feature film, The Eagle’s Mate starring Mary Pickford, was screened the following night.|$|E
5|$|The keep has {{a central}} newel staircase, linking the basement, ground and first floors. When first built, the {{garrison}} would have {{lived on the}} ground floor of the keep, the first floor being used by the captain, and the basement for stores. The ground floor is subdivided by radial walls and originally would have been further subdivided by partitions; the original ovens and fireplace survive. The first floor mainly dates from the 1720s, although some Tudor elements remain. There is a wooden lantern structure on the top of the <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> contains a bell dating from 1655 and early 18th-century graffiti. The keep's gun embrasures were converted to form sash windows in the 18th and 19th centuries.|$|E
5|$|While Germanicus enjoyed {{some success}} in his campaigns against Arminius and his allies, Tiberius decided not to attempt to conquer the Germans and {{recalled}} Germanicus to Rome. The effort {{it would have taken}} to conquer Germania Magna was deemed too great when compared with the low potential for profit from acquiring the new territory. Rome regarded Germany as a wild territory of forests and swamps, with little wealth compared to territories Rome already had. However, the campaign significantly healed the Roman psychological trauma from the Varus disaster, and greatly recovered Roman prestige. In addition to the recovery of two of the three lost eagles, Germanicus had fought Arminius, the leader who destroyed the three Roman legions in 9 AD, and defeated him in numerous battles. In leading his troops across the Rhine without recourse to Tiberius, he contradicted the advice of Augustus to <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> river as the boundary of the empire, and opened himself to potential doubts from Tiberius about his motives in taking such independent action. This error in political judgement gave Tiberius reason to controversially recall his nephew. Tacitus attributed the recall to Tiberius' jealousy of the glory Germanicus had acquired, and, with some bitterness, claims that Germanicus could have completed the conquest of Germania had he been given full independence of action.|$|E

25|$|In a 2013 interview, Cardinal Andrea Cordero Lanza di Montezemolo, {{designer}} of the coat of arms, said that Pope Emeritus Benedict XVI needed a new coat of arms {{now that he was}} no longer the pontiff. “The problem now is whether the Pope Emeritus can <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> same coat of arms or not,”. “And as a person who has always dedicated himself to this, I say ‘no,’”. He drew up a new coat of arms, which he believed could be used now by the former pontiff.

25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power {{to meet the demand}} of the inductive loads. This will <b>keep</b> <b>that</b> reactive power from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.|$|E
