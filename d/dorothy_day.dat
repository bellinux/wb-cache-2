25|$|The Second Vatican Council popularized spiritual {{movements}} among Catholics, {{and some}} lay Catholics now engage in regular contemplative {{practices such as}} centering prayer. Consistent with Vatican II, contemporary spiritual movements usually emphasize the necessity both of an interior relationship with God (private prayer) and works of justice and charity. Major 20th century writers who sought to draw together the contemplative and active poles of Christian spirituality have been <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day,</b> Thomas Merton, and Richard Rohr.|$|E
25|$|In 1860, the Bard {{family had}} {{provided}} money {{so that a}} small Episcopal seminary near their Tivoli estate could be expanded into St. Stephen's College, later renamed after them. It eventually expanded into three of the former country seats. This {{was the beginning of}} a second life for some of the old country seats, as some moved out of private residential use and became institutions. The Catholic Church received Ellerslie, Ferncliff and Linwood, using them for various purposes. <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> made Rose Hill the location of one the Catholic Worker Movement's farms during the 1960s.|$|E
25|$|In late 1933, Gold {{served a}} brief prison {{sentence}} {{after having been}} arrested for participating in a hunger march in Wilmington, Delaware. Hunger marches had been occurring throughout the United States since 1931. Catholic social activist <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> herself encouraged Gold {{to participate in a}} march from New York City to Washington, D.C. Gold was one of 315 marchers who left New York City on November 29, 1932, bound for Washington. The marchers reached Wilmington on December 2, their number having increased by several hundred. Their permit to march in the city was withdrawn. That night, the police herded most of the marchers into a warehouse downtown, but Gold, most of the women and most of the marchers from New England stayed in a rented church two blocks away. That night, the marchers at the church were refused permission to hold a meeting in the street, so they held it on the church steps. When the police tried to stop the meeting, the marchers resisted. The police began beating the people listening to the speaker, and the marchers fled into the church and barricaded the doors. The police fired tear gas through the windows of the building, then broke down the doors and entered the building with weapons drawn. The marchers resisted by hurling chairs at the police, but were beaten and gassed repeatedly until subdued. Twenty-three marchers, including Gold, were arrested. Four police and three marchers were hospitalized. Gold was convicted of incitement to riot, and served a brief prison term in Wilmington in late 1933 and early 1934. Gold participated in additional hunger marches in 1933 and 1934, and was arrested again in Albany, New York, in late October 1934.|$|E
5000|$|By 1913, {{there were}} 413 {{settlements}} in 32 states. By the 1920s, there were almost 500 settlement {{houses in the}} country. The settlement house concept was continued by <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day's</b> Catholic Worker [...] "hospitality houses" [...] in the 1930s.|$|R

500|$|The <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> Center for Service and Justice is {{responsible}} for overseeing Fordham's various community service and humanitarian initiatives. Grounded in the Jesuit principle of training [...] "men and women for others", the center organizes projects {{in such areas as}} poverty, hunger, education, and disaster relief. As a result of the <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> Center's efforts, the university performed approximately one million hours of service in 2011, ranking it sixth among universities country-wide in terms of community outreach. A popular volunteer location among students is the Jesuit Health Care Center at the Rose Hill campus where students interested in nursing gain practical experience. The <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> Center also offers a pre-orientation [...] "Urban Plunge" [...] program, introducing incoming freshmen to social justice issues in New York City.|$|E
500|$|Many of Auden's poems {{during the}} 1930s and after were {{inspired}} by unconsummated love, and in the 1950s he summarised his emotional life in a famous couplet: [...] "If equal affection cannot be / Let the more loving one be me" [...] ("The More Loving One"). He had a gift for friendship and, starting in the late 1930s, a strong wish for the stability of marriage; {{in a letter to}} his friend James Stern he called marriage [...] "the only subject." [...] Throughout his life, Auden performed charitable acts, sometimes in public (as in his 1935 marriage of convenience to Erika Mann that provided her with a British passport to escape the Nazis), but, especially in later years, more often in private. He was embarrassed if they were publicly revealed, as when his gift to his friend <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> for the Catholic Worker movement was reported on the front page of The New York Times in 1956.|$|E
2500|$|Historian John McGreevey notes, [...] "Priests {{across the}} country in the 1930s {{encouraged}} their parishioners to join unions, and some like Pittsburgh's Monsignor Charles Rice, Detroit's Frederick Siedenberg, and Buffalo's Monsignor John P.Boland, served on regional labor boards and played key roles in workplace negotiations." [...] The Catholic Worker Movement and <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> grew out of the same impetuses to put Catholic social teaching into action.|$|E

5000|$|Peace journalism {{follows a}} long history of news publication, {{originating}} in non-sectarian Christian peace movements and societies of the early 19th century, which published periodicals. Sectarian organizations also created publications focused on peace as part of their proselytizing in the 19th century, as did utopian communities of the period. From the 20th century, a prominent example of sectarian journalism focused on peace was <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day's</b> Catholic Worker.|$|R
500|$|As young socialists, Kahn's and Horowitz's [...] talents were {{recognized}} by Michael Harrington. Harrington had joined Shachtman after working with <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day's</b> Catholic Worker's house of hospitality in the Bowery of Lower Manhattan.

Kahn idolized Harrington, particularly for his erudition and rhetoric, both in writing and in debate.|$|R
2500|$|The Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism (later {{known as}} the Committee of Catholics for Human Rights) was an American Catholic anti-racist {{organization}} formed in May 1939, partially {{in response to the}} 1938 announcement of Pope Pius XI that [...] "it is not possible for Christians to take part in anti-Semitism". [...] It was supported by many prominent Catholics, including members of the Catholic Worker Movement, among them <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day.</b>|$|E
2500|$|There were {{conscientious}} objectors and war tax resisters in both World War I and World War II. [...] The United States government allowed sincere objectors {{to serve}} in noncombatant military roles. However, those draft resisters who refused any cooperation with the war effort often spent much of each war in federal prisons. During World War II, pacifist leaders like <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> and Ammon Hennacy of the Catholic Worker Movement urged young Americans not to enlist in military service.|$|E
2500|$|These, {{together}} with his Dichos de Luz y Amor (or [...] "Sayings of Light and Love") and Saint Teresa's writings, {{are the most important}} mystical works in Spanish, and have deeply influenced later spiritual writers all around the world. Among these are T. S. Eliot, Thérèse de Lisieux, Edith Stein (Teresa Benedicta of the Cross) and Thomas Merton. John has also influenced philosophers (Jacques Maritain), theologians (Hans Urs von Balthasar), pacifists (<b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day,</b> Daniel Berrigan and Philip Berrigan) and artists (Salvador Dalí). Pope John Paul II wrote his theological dissertation on the mystical theology of Saint John of the Cross.|$|E

5000|$|The Catholic Worker {{movement}} {{began as}} a means to combine <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day's</b> history in American social activism, anarchism, and pacifism with the tenets of Catholicism (including a strong current of distributism), five years after her 1927 conversion.The group started with the Catholic Worker magazine that staked out a neutral, pacifist position in the war-torn 1930s. This grew into a [...] "house of hospitality" [...] in the slums of New York City and then a series of farms for people to live together communally. The movement quickly spread to other cities in the United States, and to Canada and Britain.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the twentieth}} century there was a notable trend among {{prominent}} Roman Catholics towards pacifism. [...] Individuals such as <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> and Henri Nouwen stand out among them. The monk and mystic Thomas Merton was noted for his commitment to pacifism during the Vietnam War era. [...] Murdered Salvadoran Bishop Oscar Romero was notable for using non-violent resistance tactics and wrote meditative sermons focusing {{on the power of}} prayer and peace. School of the Americas Watch was founded by Maryknoll Fr. Roy Bourgeois in 1990 and uses strictly pacifist principles to protest the training of Latin American military officers by United States Army officers at the School of the Americas in the state of Georgia.|$|E
2500|$|In September 1938 Pope Pius XI, {{speaking}} {{to a group of}} Belgian pilgrims, denounced anti-Semitism explicitly, saying that it was incompatible with Christianity. [...] Influenced by this statement, a group of American bishops released a statement encouraging Catholics to, [...] "guard against all forms of racial bigotry." [...] Inspired by the statement of the bishops, the Committee of Catholics to Fight Anti-Semitism was formed in May 1939 by <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day,</b> Catherine Doherty, other supporters of the Catholic Worker Movement, and Emmanuel Chapman, professor at Fordham University, who was its first executive secretary. [...] Also included among the founders were artists, philosophers, writers and, according to Day, [...] "a long list of priests and nuns." [...] In August 1939 the group changed its name to the Committee of Catholics for Human Rights.|$|E
2500|$|His {{record for}} the next 33 fights fell to 11–20–2. With his family in poverty during the Great Depression, Braddock {{had to give up}} boxing for a little while and worked as a longshoreman. [...] Due to {{frequent}} injuries to his right hand, Braddock compensated by using his left hand during his longshoreman work, and it gradually became stronger than his right. He always remembered the humiliation of having to accept government relief money, but was inspired by the Catholic Worker Movement, a Christian social justice organization founded by <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> and Peter Maurin in 1933 to help the homeless and hungry. After his boxing comeback, Braddock returned the welfare money he had received and made frequent donations to various Catholic Worker Houses, including feeding homeless guests with his family.|$|E
50|$|He {{was born}} in St. Louis, Missouri, on February 24, 1928, to an Irish-American family. He {{attended}} St. Roch Catholic School and St. Louis University High School, {{where he was a}} classmate (class of 1944) of Thomas Anthony Dooley III. He later attended the College of the Holy Cross, the University of Chicago (MA in English Literature), and Yale Law School. As a young man, he was interested in both leftist politics and Roman Catholicism. He joined <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day's</b> Catholic Worker Movement, a communal movement that stressed social justice and nonviolence. Harrington enjoyed arguing about culture and politics, and his Jesuit education had made him a good debater and rhetorician.|$|R

50|$|Families {{have had}} a variety of roles in the Catholic Worker movement. Because those {{donating}} funds to the houses of hospitality were primarily interested in helping the poor, the higher cost of maintaining a volunteer family (as opposed to maintaining an individual volunteer) conflicted with the wishes of those donating. Author Daniel McKanan has suggested that, {{for a variety of}} reasons, <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day's</b> perspective on family involvement in the movement was controversial. Despite these elements of conflict, families have participated in the Catholic Worker movement through multiple avenues: some assist the houses of hospitality while others open up a “Christ room” in their homes for people in need. There are many other opportunities for family involvement in the Catholic Worker as well, with some families running their own houses of hospitality.|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, traditionalist {{conservatism}} found its defenders {{through the efforts}} of Hilaire Belloc, G. K. Chesterton and other proponents of the socioeconomic system they advocated: distributism. Originating in the papal encyclical Rerum novarum, distributism employed the concept of subsidiarity as a [...] "third way" [...] solution to the twin evils of socialism and capitalism. It favors local economies, small business, the agrarian way of life and craftsmen and artists. In such books as Belloc's The Servile State (1912), Economics for Helen (1924) and An Essay on the Restoration of Property (1936) and Chesterton's The Outline of Sanity (1926), traditional communities that echoed those found in the Middle Ages were advocated and big business and big government condemned. In the United States, distributist ideas were embraced by the journalist Herbert Agar, Catholic activist <b>Dorothy</b> <b>Day</b> and through the influence of the German-born British economist E. F. Schumacher and were comparable to the work of Wilhelm Roepke.|$|E
