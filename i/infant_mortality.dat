5|$|<b>Infant</b> <b>mortality</b> {{is often}} high among ruffed lemurs, {{but can also}} be highly variable. In some seasons, as many as 65% are unable to reach three months of age, {{possibly}} due to falls and related injuries, although in some seasons <b>infant</b> <b>mortality</b> is as low as 0%. For those that do survive to adulthood, sexual maturity is attained at 18 to 20 months in females and 32 to 48 months in males. Sexual maturity may take longer to reach in the wild compared to captivity. For females, the inter-birth interval, or time between successive offspring, is typically one year, and in captivity, females can remain reproductively active {{until the age of}} 23. The life expectancy for both species of ruffed lemur is estimated at 36 years in captivity.|$|E

40|$|When {{historians of}} {{the early twentieth century}} discuss American efforts to reduce <b>infant</b> and {{maternal}} <b>mortality,</b> they often do so in reference to female political reform, public health reform, or the evolution of obstetrics. When <b>infant</b> and maternal <b>mortality</b> are viewed through these historical lenses, the emphasis tends to revolve around professionals and specialists: female reformers in the Children's Bureau, members of the Public Health Service, and members of the American Medical Association. Viewing the issue from this perspective does not give due consideration to the very public nature of the national discussion over the causes of, solutions to, and larger meaning of America's high rates of <b>infant</b> and maternal <b>mortality</b> in the early twentieth century. This thesis argues that the period between 1909 and 1936 was unique because <b>infant</b> and maternal <b>mortality</b> were widely discussed in the popular press and treated more as social and political problems than as medical ones. Careful analysis of the evolving rhetoric in the national popular press surrounding <b>infant</b> and maternal <b>mortality,</b> highlights the ways in which Progressives and reformers used these issues to address many other pressing national concerns such as immigration, gender equality, and medical specialization...|$|R
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] This study {{aimed to}} analyse the {{influence}} of social, economic, and health development on <b>infant</b> and perinatal <b>mortality</b> in Spain between 1975 and 1986, and to identify possible changes in these relationships over time. DESIGN [...] Study of the association between mortality {{and a range of}} variables. SETTING [...] 50 Spanish provinces. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] Mean <b>infant</b> and perinatal <b>mortality</b> were estimated for two periods [...] 1975 - 8 and 1983 - 6. Social, economic, and health care indicators were collected as independent variables for these two periods. The rates of variation between periods were estimated for each variable. Multiple linear regression models were used to define the association between <b>infant</b> and perinatal <b>mortality</b> and their respective rate of variation with the former indicators. Mean familial income was the main predictive factor for <b>infant</b> and perinatal <b>mortality</b> in the first period but in the second period health care indicators were more relevant.

In revealing <b>infants</b> <b>mortality,</b> merely physiological factors aren’t effective. Health, economic and social factors had considerable effects on the frequencies of this index. This is a health index and also indicates economic, social and cultural development, as high rate of disease and <b>mortality</b> especially among <b>infants</b> and children not only shows low level of society’s health but also {{is a sign of}} lacking enough health training. The current research is documentary in which some questionnaires were used to gather needed information using available documents in health house and answering the questions in them. To determine the causal model of research some theories such as the relation of morality economic development, epidemiologic transition theory, population transition theory, medical technology development theory and ecologic theory were used. From all alive births during fourth development project (2005 - 2009) all through the villages of Kerman, 104 dead infants under one year (statistics) and 150 alive infants under one year (sampling) were selected, and a questionnaire was completed based on available information in files from health house by auxiliary nurses and some cases which weren’t in the files were completed referring their houses.
