5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of <b>epoxides,</b> aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of <b>epoxides</b> via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E
50|$|<b>Epoxide</b> hydrolases (EH's), {{also known}} as <b>epoxide</b> hydratases, are enzymes that metabolize {{compounds}} that contain an <b>epoxide</b> residue; they convert this residue to two hydroxyl residues through a dihydroxylation reaction to form diol products. Several enzymes possess EH activity. Microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase (<b>epoxide</b> hydrolase 1, EH1, or mEH), soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase (sEH, <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase 2, EH2, or cytoplasmic <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase), and the more recently discovered but not as yet well defined functionally, <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase 3 (EH3) and <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase 4 (EH4) are structurally closely related isozymes. Other enzymes with <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase activity include leukotriene A4 hydrolase, Cholesterol-5,6-oxide hydrolase, MEST (gene) (Peg1/MEST), and Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase. The hydrolases are distinguished from each other by their substrate preferences and, directly related to this, their functions.|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} {{amino acid}} sequence relationships among soluble and microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolases, haloacid dehalogenases, and a haloalkane dehalogenase. The amino-terminal residues (1 - 229) of mammalian soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase are homologous to a haloacid dehalogenase. The carboxy-terminal residues (230 - 554) of mammalian soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase are homologous to haloalkane dehalogenase, to plant soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase, and to microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase. The shared identity between the haloacid and haloalkane dehalogenases does not indicate relatedness between {{these two types of}} dehalogenases. The amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal homologies of mammalian soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase to the respective dehalogenases suggests that this <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase, but not the soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase of plant or the microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase, derives from a gene fusion. The homology of microsomal to soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase suggests they derive from a gene duplication, probably of an ancestral bacterial (<b>epoxide)</b> hydrolase gene. Based on homology to haloalkane dehalogenase, the catalytic residues for the soluble and microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolases are predicted. A nomenclature system based on divergent molecular evolution is proposed for these <b>epoxide</b> hydrolases...|$|R

5|$|The form of sEH in the {{intracellular}} {{environment is}} a homodimer with two distinct activities {{in two separate}} structural domains of each monomer: the C-terminal epoxide hydrolase activity (soluble epoxide hydrolase: EC 3.3.2.10) and the N-terminal phosphatase activity (lipid-phosphate phosphatase: EC 3.1.3.76). sEH converts <b>epoxides,</b> or three membered cyclic ethers, to their corresponding diols through {{the addition of a}} molecule of water. The resulting diols are more water-soluble than the parent <b>epoxides,</b> and so are more readily excreted by the organism.|$|E

5|$|Soluble epoxide {{hydrolase}} (sEH) is a bifunctional {{enzyme that}} in humans is encoded by the EPHX2 gene. sEH {{is a member}} of the epoxide hydrolase family. This enzyme, found in both the cytosol and peroxisomes, binds to specific <b>epoxides</b> and converts them to the corresponding diols. A different region of this protein also has lipid-phosphate phosphatase activity. Mutations in the EPHX2 gene have been associated with familial hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
50|$|This enzyme {{belongs to}} the family of hydrolases, {{specifically}} those acting on ether bonds (ether hydrolases). The systematic name of this enzyme class is cis-stilbene-oxide hydrolase.

40|$|AbstractEndogenous, {{constitutive}} soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase in mice 3 T 3 cells was localized via immunofluorescence microscopy {{exclusively in}} peroxisomes, whereas transiently expressed mouse soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase (from clofibrate-treated liver) accumulated {{only in the}} cytosol of 3 T 3 and HeLa cells. When the C-terminal Ile of mouse soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase was mutated to generate a prototypic putative type 1 PTS (-SKI to -SKL), the enzyme targeted to peroxisomes. The possibility that soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase-SKI was sorted slowly to peroxiosmes from the cytosol was examined by stably expressing rat soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase-SKI appended to the green fluorescent protein. Green fluorescent protein soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase-SKI was strictly cytosolic, indicating that -SKI was not a temporally inefficient putative type 1 PTS. Import of soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase-SKI into peroxisomes in plant cells revealed that the context of -SKI on soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase was targeting permissible. These {{results show that the}} C-terminal -SKI is a non-functional putative type 1 PTS on soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase and suggest the existence of distinct cytosolic and peroxisomal targeting variants of soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase in mouse and rat...|$|R

25|$|Enzymes in the {{cytochrome}} family (CYP1A1, CYP1A2, CYP1B1) metabolize PAHs to diol <b>epoxides.</b> PAH exposure {{can increase}} {{production of the}} cytochrome enzymes, allowing the enzymes to convert PAHs into mutagenic diol <b>epoxides</b> at greater rates. In this pathway, PAH molecules bind to the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) and activate it as a transcription factor that increases production of the cytochrome enzymes. The activity of these enzymes may at times conversely protect against PAH toxicity, which is not yet well understood.|$|E
25|$|DHA can be metabolized into DHA-derived {{specialized}} pro-resolving mediators (SPMs), DHA <b>epoxides,</b> electrophilic oxo-derivatives (EFOX) of DHA, neuroprostanes, ethanolamines, acylglycerols, docosahexaenoyl amides of {{amino acids}} or neurotransmitters, and branched DHA esters of hydroxy fatty acids, among others.|$|E

5000|$|... ==Identity of hepoxilin-epoxide {{hydrolase}}== Recent {{studies have}} shown that Soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase (i.e. <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase 2 or EH2) readily metabolizes a) hepoxilin A3 (8-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,8Z,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) to trioxilin A3 (8,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) and b) hepoxilin B3 (10-hydroxy-11S,12Sepoxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid) to trioxlin B3 (10,11,12-trihydroxy-(5Z,9E,14Z)-eicosatrienoic acid. Soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase (i.e. <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase 2 or EH2) sEH also appears to be the hepoxilin hydrolase that is responsible for inactivating the epoxyalcohol metabolites of arachidonic acid, hepoxilin A3 and hepoxiin B3. Soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase is widely expressed in a diversity of human and other mammal tissues and therefore appears to be the hepoxilin hydrolase responsible for inactivating hepoxilin A3 and B3 (see soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase#Function and <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase#Hepoxilin-epoxide hydrolase). The ability of EH1, EH3, EH4, and leukotriene A4 hydrolase to metabolize hepoxilins to trioxilins has not yet been reported.|$|R
40|$|Mammalian soluble and microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolases {{have been}} {{proposed}} {{to belong to the}} family of alpha/beta-hydrolase-fold enzymes. These enzymes hydrolyse their substrates by a catalytic triad, with the first step of the enzymatic reaction being the formation of a covalent enzyme-substrate ester. In the present paper, we describe the direct visualization of the ester formation between rat microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase and its substrate. Microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase was precipitated with acetone after brief incubation with [1 -(14) C]epoxystearic acid. After denaturing SDS gel electrophoresis the protein-bound radioactivity was detected by fluorography. Pure <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase and crude microsomes showed a single radioactive signal of the expected molecular mass that could be suppressed by inclusion of the competitive inhibitor 1, 1, 1 -trichloropropene oxide in the incubation mixture. In a similar manner, 4 -fluorochalcone-oxide-sensitive binding of epoxystearic acid to rat soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase could be demonstrated in rat liver cytosol. Under similar conditions, no covalent binding of [26 -(14) C]cholesterol- 5 alpha, 6 alpha-epoxide to microsomal proteins or solubilized fractions tenfold enriched in cholesterol <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase activity could be observed. Our data provide definitive proof for the formation of an enzyme-substrate-ester intermediate formed in the course of <b>epoxide</b> hydrolysis by microsomal <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase, show no formation of a covalent intermediate between cholesterol <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase and its substrate under the same conditions as those under which an intermediate was shown for both microsomal and soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolases and therefore indicate that the cholesterol <b>epoxide</b> hydrolase apparently does not act by a similar mechanism and is probably not structurally related to microsomal and soluble <b>epoxide</b> hydrolases...|$|R

25|$|Ethers {{are quite}} stable {{chemical}} compounds {{which do not}} react with bases, active metals, dilute acids, oxidising agents and reducing agents. Generally, they are of low chemical reactivity, but they are more reactive than alkanes (<b>epoxides,</b> ketals, and acetals are unrepresentative classes of ethers and are discussed in separate articles). Important reactions are listed below.|$|E
25|$|The {{biotransformation}} {{process can}} activate the PAH compound and {{transform it into}} a diol epoxide, {{which is a very}} reactive intermediate. These diol-epoxides covalently bind with DNA base pairs, most often with guanine and adenine to form stable adducts within the DNA structure. The binding of diol <b>epoxides</b> and DNA base pairs blocks polymerase replication activity. This blockage ultimately contributes to an increase in DNA damage by reducing repair activity.|$|E
25|$|Polyols can be {{polyether}} polyols, {{which are}} made by the reaction of <b>epoxides</b> with an active hydrogen containing compounds. Polyester polyols are made by the polycondensation of multifunctional carboxylic acids and polyhydroxyl compounds. They can be further classified according to their end use. Higher molecular weight polyols (molecular weights from 2,000 to 10,000) are used to make more flexible polyurethanes while lower molecular weight polyols make more rigid products.|$|E

5000|$|Soil {{microorganisms}} transform heptachlor by epoxidation, hydrolysis, and reduction. When {{the compound}} was incubated with a mixed culture of organisms, chlordene (hexachlorocyclopentadine, its precursor) formed, which was further metabolized to chlordene <b>epoxide.</b> Other metabolites include 1-hydroxychlordene, 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene, and heptachlor <b>epoxide.</b> Soil microorganisms hydrolyze heptachlor to give ketochlordene. Rats metabolize heptachlor to the <b>epoxide</b> 1-exo-1-hydroxyheptachlor <b>epoxide</b> and 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. When heptachlor <b>epoxide</b> was incubated with microsomal preparations form liver of pigs and from houseflies, the products found were diol and 1-hydroxy-2,3-epoxychlordene. [...] Metabolic scheme in rats shows two pathways {{with the same}} metabolite. The first involves following scheme: heptachlor → heptachlor <b>epoxide</b> → dehydrogenated derivative of 1-exo-hydroxy-2,3-exo-epoxychlordene → 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene. The second involves: Heptachlor → 1-exo-hydroxychlordene → 1-exo-hydroxy, 2,3-exo-epoxychlordene → 1,2-dihydrooxydihydrochlordene.|$|R
25|$|Alkenes are {{oxidized}} with a {{large number}} of oxidizing agents. In the presence of oxygen, alkenes burn with a bright flame to produce carbon dioxide and water. Catalytic oxidation with oxygen or the reaction with percarboxylic acids yields <b>epoxides.</b> Reaction with ozone in ozonolysis leads to the breaking of the double bond, yielding two aldehydes or ketones. Reaction with concentrated, hot KMnO4 (or other oxidizing salts) in an acidic solution will yield ketones or carboxylic acids.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} {{limitation of}} both of the above methods is incompatibility with free amine or alkene functionality, both of which undergo competitive oxidation. The use of bis(acetoxy)iodobenzene (BAIB) as the terminal oxidant avoids this problem. BAIB is unable to oxidize the nitroxide radical directly, and initial formation of oxoammonium {{is believed to be}} due to acid-catalyzed disproportionation. BAIB may then oxidize the resulting hydroxylamine to an oxoammonium salt. Although the reaction is conducted under acidic conditions (acetic acid is a byproduct, and is often added to facilitate disproportionation), selectivity for primary alcohol oxidation is substantial. Base-sensitive functional groups, such as <b>epoxides,</b> are tolerated under these conditions.|$|E
25|$|Smoke {{contains}} several carcinogenic pyrolytic {{products that}} bind to DNA and cause genetic mutations. Particularly potent carcinogens are {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} (PAH), which are toxicated to mutagenic <b>epoxides.</b> The first PAH {{to be identified as}} a carcinogen in tobacco smoke was benzopyrene, which has been shown to toxicate into an epoxide that irreversibly attaches to a cell's nuclear DNA, which may either kill the cell or cause a genetic mutation. If the mutation inhibits programmed cell death, the cell can survive to become a cancer cell. Similarly, acrolein, which is abundant in tobacco smoke, also irreversibly binds to DNA, causes mutations and thus also cancer. However, it needs no activation to become carcinogenic.|$|E

When <b>epoxides</b> are reduced using LAH, the reagent attacks the less hindered end of the epoxide, usually producing a secondary or tertiary alcohol.
