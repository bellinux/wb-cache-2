A <b>full</b> <b>spool</b> replaces the entire carrier assembly with a single machined piece. A <b>full</b> <b>spool</b> is perhaps the strongest means of locking an axle, but has no ability to differentiate wheel speeds whatsoever, putting high stress on all affected driveline components.|$|E

50|$|The {{internal}} spider gears {{of an open}} differential {{can also}} be welded {{together to create a}} locked axle; this method is not recommended as the welding process seriously compromises the metallurgical composition of the welded components, and can lead to failure of the unit under stress. If it is desirable to have a spooled axle, the better option is to install either a mini-spool or a <b>full</b> <b>spool.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{river is}} the water flow {{over the surface}} of the Earth, besides the water flow and {{sediment}} transport are also contained in the water of the river. SABO dam is made on the river which are intended to hold or control sediment especially bed load and suspended load that can be carried away by the flow of the River {{at the time of the}} flood. This research is located in the village of one accord or Land one accord is part of Amahai Subdistrict located at the southern coast of Seram island. The purpose of the research is to analyze the sediment transport capacity, analyzing River catchment sabo dam village one accord, and analyze the durations <b>full</b> <b>spool</b> sabo dam on river discharge reliable. The results of this research i. e. sedimentation from an area stream can be determined with the measurement of sediment transport at the control point from the flow of the River, or by using empirical formulas by using the method of Meyer Petter Muller (MPM). Obtained results of Suspended Load of 0. 0176 tons/day to discharge normal, 0. 055 tons/day to discharge flood period of 10 -year anniversary, and 0. 061 tons/day to discharge flood period 25 -year anniversary. Bed Load of 2. 22 tons/day to discharge normal, 3. 07 tons/day to discharge flood period of 10 years, and repeated 3. 07 tons/day to discharge flood period 25 years anniversary and the calculation result and analysis done on Sabo Dam, obtained conclusions Sabo Dam one accord can accommodate as many as 9, 140. 62 m 3 of sediment. Based on the results of the calculations and analyses done on Sabo Dam, obtained conclusions Sabo Dam one accord takes a full 27 years if normal debit, debit 1. 12 years if flood period 10 years anniversary, and 1, 019 years if debit flood period 25 -year anniversary...|$|E
