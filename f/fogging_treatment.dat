40|$|In Mediterranean regions, many {{tomato plants}} are grown {{throughout}} the hot summer period (May–September) in sheltered cultivation, mainly for plant protection reasons. Most of the shelters {{that are used}} are low cost net houses covered with 50 mesh insect proof net. In most cases these net houses have a flat roof and no ventilation or climate control measures. This insufficient ventilation during the hot summer leads to above optimal air temperatures and causes moderate heat stress inside the shelters, which leads to yield reduction. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the ability of a simple and inexpensive low pressure fogging system installed in a naturally ventilated net house to lower temperatures and improve the yield during the summer. The study showed that in areas where relative air humidity (RH) during the daytime is less than 60 %, tomato plants improved their performance when grown through the summer in net houses under moderate heat stress. Under fogging conditions pollen grain viability and fruit set were significantly improved. This improvement influenced the yield picked during September (104 – 136 DAP). However, total seasonal yield was not affected by the <b>fogging</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Potato storage {{trials were}} {{conducted}} in 2002 and 2003 in New Brunswick, Canada. Two potato cultivars, Russet Burbank and Dark Red Norland were used. Potato samples in mesh bags (9 kg each) untreated with sprout inhibitors were placed in wooden pallet boxes commonly used in potato storages. A wooden divider divided each box into two portions. Six samples of Russet Burbank were placed in one portion and 6 samples of Dark Red Norland {{were placed in the}} other portion. Two treatments (control and OxiDate 1 : 50) were replicated three times for each cultivar. Using a <b>fogging</b> system, <b>treatments</b> were applied daily for 2 weeks (8 h/day) and then once (8 h) per week {{for the duration of the}} experiment. Results indicated that OxiDate treatment helped reduce the level of early blight severity in storage by up to 10. 4 % over 16 weeks when compared to the untreated check...|$|R
40|$|Introduction and Objective. In {{the last}} decades, {{large-scale}} swine production {{has led to}} intensive rearing systems in which air quality can be easily degraded by aerial contaminants that can pose a health risk to the pigs and farm workers. This study evaluated the effects of fogging disinfectant procedure on productive performance, ammonia and dust concentration, aerobic bacteria and fungal spores spreading in the farrowing–weaning room. Materials and Method. This trial was conducted in 2 identical farrowing-weaning rooms of a piggery. In both rooms, 30 pregnant sows were lodged in individual cages. At 75 days of age, the piglets were moved to the fattening room. In the treated room, {{with the birth of}} the first suckling-pig, the fogging disinfection with diluted Virkon S was applied once a day in the experimental room per 15 minutes at 11 : 00. The <b>fogging</b> disinfectant <b>treatment</b> was switched between rooms {{at the end of the}} first trial period. Temperature, relative humidity, dust (TSP-RF fractions and number of particles), ammonia concentration and aerial contaminants (enterococci, Micrococcaeae and fungal spores) were monitored in both rooms. Results. Ammonia concentration reduction induced by fogging disinfection was estimated 18...|$|R
