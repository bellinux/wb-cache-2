Resilience thinking revolves around system changes and to ignore or resist change makes us more susceptible to damage. The research attempts to apply resilience thinking in new town development in ecological sensitive areas. In particular, the paper proposes to impose ecological capacity control and projection of construction scales in the planning stage, to build an operational index system between planning and implementation, to avail the feedback mechanism in decision-making, and to ensure accurate implementation of the plan...|$|E
40|$|The {{identification}} of urban growth boundaries (UGBs) as components of an ecologically liveable city is rather significant in urban space management. However, {{the evaluation of}} ecosystem service in establishing UGBs as reactions to protect open spaces and <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>area</b> are largely ignored. Furthermore, the lack of scenario analysis for urban growth patterns has {{made it difficult to}} adjust planning existed. Accordingly, in this paper, we take Hangzhou metropolitan areas (HMA) as the study area, using Landsat TM image data, and established the UGBs for the HMA based on ecosystem service by the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA) model with scenario analysis. The results suggested that: 1) The risk of urban development in the northern and eastern areas of the central city is relatively low, while the southern, eastern and south-western areas need intensive protection; 2) In the model of ecological management, the erosion of ecological space has increased gradually and the regional ecological patterns in the fourth scenarios have faced great challenges; 3) UGBs for the HMA were identified as the view of development and ecological space complementarily...|$|E

40|$|In nature-based tourism destination, {{sustainable}} tourism {{is a more}} responsible form of tourism seeks to minimize the undesirable impacts of tourism development in <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> apart from contributing to nature conservation. While these objectives must be achieved, {{it is also important}} to ensure a high level of tourist satisfaction which is central to the survival of tourism business. In protected areas, park management is traditionally a responsibility of public sector. While public sector is said to be in a better position in securing the interest of public, tourism business is not their forte but private sector due to the heavy bureaucratic nature of the former and the profit-driven nature of the latter. Kinabalu Park is a famous nature-based tourism destination in Malaysia for its flora diversity and splendid mountainous landscape. By borrowing the case of Kinabalu Park, this paper aims to reveal some arising issues in park management resulted from the involvement of private sector in protected areas based on the discourse on nature of goods and services...|$|R

40|$|We {{describe}} a theoretical model aiming {{to discuss the}} welfare implications of different institutional architectures, varying from complete centralised political choices to different degrees of subnational political autonomy, {{for the management of}} territorially located environmental resources like forest or <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas.</b> By voting citizens express preferences regarding the desired political decision level. This issue is expressively important in the environment context since despite the increasing awareness of environmental questions, environmental degradation remains. Sustainability requires environmental governance which is only feasible if citizens are engaged and mobilised for it, which is ensured when their preferences are considered. The subnational political autonomy proposed in the model can assume two forms: the implementation of isolated communities or definition of a region. A trade-off between costsharing of environmental protection and the loss that result from sharing it with individuals holding different preferences is widely pondered. This model allows us to conclude that in the absence of inter-community compensatory transfers and {{in the presence of a}} unanimity voting system, citizens’ voice, stability and efficiency conditions are only guaranteed when citizens are completely segregated into homogenous communities or when there is a centralised political regime.

In 1993 The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality developed a Cross-media Comparative Risk Assessment model to address certain regulatory concerns. Due to budget constraints {{the model was}} never beta tested. Now in 1995, the X-media project has been reopened, and the model revised, and tested. Specific revisions include: 1) Upgrade from a Level II to a Level III Fugacity Model, 2) Incorporation of compound specific Mass Transfer Coefficients and Molecular diffusities into the Level III Fugacity model 3) redefining the exposure factor from total compound amount to media specific concentrations 4) refinement of procedures for using the model and 5) conversion of the model from Oracle 7 to an Excel spreadsheet format. The model generates a Human and Ecological Risk index for a facility releasing toxins into the environment. The Risk Indices are based on chemical fate and transport predictions, toxicity, population density and <b>ecological</b> <b>Sensitive</b> <b>areas.</b> The model {{can be used to}} rank facilities for inspection or as a tool to assess the progress of pollution prevention programs.

40|$|The {{analysis}} {{of land use}} changes is essential to evaluate the ecological consequence of urbanization and anthropogenic pressure, and, more importantly, it can provide basic information for appropriate decision-making. In fact, urban development can impact environmental quality and ecosystem services. Major urbanization phenomenon is often accompanied by green component and natural resources areas. Instead of using traditional analysis methods which have {{a long period of}} applications and problems with large amounts of data, we chose to use remote sensing and GIS to derive the land use information and to perform the spatial analysis. In the case study, Istanbul is a metropolitan area where the spatial growth is rapid; due to population growing and urbanization, the Instanbul agglomeration is effectively forced on Tekirdag, on the Marmara Sea coast of Thrace. Nowadays, the 90 % of Tekirdag lands are productive agricultural ones, 54 % of which are composed by rich agricultural soil; in the studying region, about 10700 ha of green <b>area,</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> (legally conserved by European Wildlife and Natural Habitat) and an Ergene Water Basin, which vitalize the Thrace sub region, are present. Threat of industry, growing population and urbanization indicate that Tekirdag will have irrevocable environmental problems in the future. This paper presents a first {{analysis of}} the risk zones under urbanization pressure close to Tekirdag by using GIS and Remote Sensing instruments. Consecutive processes such as image enhancement, emerging and re-sampling are applied to high resolution satellite data, to prepare it for analysis and interpretation with image classification.

40|$|Biological {{invasion}} {{is one of}} {{the three}} most intractable environmental problems. As an important component of global change, biological invasion can be influenced by the other components of global change. As the transitional zone between ocean and land, the coastal ecosystem is the most important buffer which has undergone the impact of sea level rise induced by global change. Furthermore, coastal zone, which has been suffered from frequently and intensively anthropogenic disturbance, is an <b>ecological</b> and environmental <b>sensitive</b> <b>area,</b> {{and one of the most}} frequently invaded ecosystems. In this paper, the effects of elevated CO 2, sea level rise and eutrophication on the process of biological invasion have been analyzed based on the invasive status of coastal ecosystem. The results indicate that elevated CO 2 disturbs the competitive balance between invasive and native species. Sea level rise adjusts the spatial pattern of invasive species and eutrophication of coastal ecosystem promotes further spread of alien species. At last, the research hotspots about interactions between global change and biological invasion in coastal ecosystem are discussed...|$|R

Considering these areas are constantly exposed to aggregation of water pollutants and also consequence resulting from construction and development activities, they are very vulnerable. Therefore, "sensitive Coastal areas" has become a common word in the related subjects to marine environment recently. The said title relates to the areas of the coastal lines which are vulnerable to the natural condition or human actions because of ecological, social, economic, educational and research importance, also they need particular supports. The southern coasts of Caspian Sea, In Iran prominent samples are of these <b>sensitive</b> <b>areas</b> which their environment are exposed to demolition and destruction intensely, due to increasing and uncontrolled development.

These reserves are often far from civilization, deep in the sea or in regions such as the Arctic. Now, more than ever, risks related to transporting oil and gas products need to be determined in these remote and <b>sensitive</b> <b>ecological</b> <b>areas.</b> Continuous monitoring of subsea pipelines {{is the best way}} to detect leaks quickly and prevent/minimize damage. A number of systems and technologies exist for this purpose. The present work describes two analytical approaches to making decisions related to best technology selection. The first is selecting the best available technology through researching desired parameters and conducting objective analysis. The second approach uses a risk-based methodology for identifying the best technology. The key focus of the present work is to develop a method to quantify uncertainties involved with leak detection technologies on subsea arctic pipelines applicable to harsh environments and use the quantified uncertainty in decision making. This thesis presents both approaches in detail and discusses their application to a real-life case study...|$|R
