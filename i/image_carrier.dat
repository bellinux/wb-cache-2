Domain wavelet transform used in the visible watermark does not provide security for watermark. Visible watermark methods do not provide safety for both watermark and <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> To overcome that, lossless watermarking using histogram shifting algorithm is proposed. The <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> carries watermark. The <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> can be stored lossless after the extraction of watermark from it. Histogram Shifting algorithm is used to embed watermark logo in the <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> By using the Rijndael algorithm, the error is spread to the entire image. So the illegal user can not access the watermark <b>image</b> from <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> This algorithm can guarantee {{the quality of the}} image and safety of watermark.

40|$|Abstract — We {{describe}} an effective method for image encryption which employs magnitude and phase manipulation using <b>carrier</b> <b>images.</b> Although it involves traditional methods like magnitude and phase encryptions, {{the novelty of}} this work lies in deploying the concept of <b>carrier</b> <b>images</b> for encryption purpose. To this end, a <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> is randomly chosen from a set of stored images. One dimensional (1 -D) discrete Fourier transform (DFT) is then carried out on the original image to be encrypted along with the <b>carrier</b> <b>image.</b> Row wise spectral addition and scaling is performed between the magnitude spectra of the original and <b>carrier</b> <b>images</b> by randomly selecting the rows. Similarly, row wise phase addition and scaling is performed between the original and <b>carrier</b> <b>images</b> phase spectra by randomly selecting the rows. The encrypted image obtained by these two operations is further subjected to one more level of magnitude and phase manipulation using another randomly chosen <b>carrier</b> <b>image</b> by 1 -D DFT along the columns. The resulting encrypted image {{is found to be}} fully distorted, resulting in increasing the robustness of the proposed work.
