5|$|Marco Pesenti Gritti, the {{initiator}} of Galeon, {{originally developed}} Epiphany in 2002 as a fork of Galeon. The fork occurred {{because of the}} divergent aims of Gritti {{and the rest of}} Galeon development team about new features. While Gritti regarded Galeon's monolithic design and the number of user-configurable features as factors limiting Galeon's maintainability and user base expansion, the rest of the Galeon developers wanted to see more features added. At the same time the GNOME project created the GNOME <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> guidelines, which promoted simplification of user interfaces. As Galeon was oriented towards power users, most developers saw the implementation of those guidelines as unacceptable. As a result, Gritti created a new browser based on Galeon's codebase, with most of the non-mission-critical features removed. He intended Epiphany to comply fully with the GNOME <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> guidelines, with a very simple user-interface. As such, Epiphany does not have its own theme settings and uses GNOME's settings, which are specified in the GNOME Control Center.|$|E
5|$|The browser was forked from Galeon, after developers' {{disagreements}} about Galeon's growing complexity. Since then Web {{has been}} developed {{as part of the}} GNOME project and uses most of GNOME's technology and settings when applicable. It is part of the GNOME Core Applications. As required by the GNOME <b>Human</b> <b>Interface</b> Guidelines (HIG), Web maintains a clean and simple graphical user interface with only a required minimum number of features exposed to users by default. The browser's functionality and configurability can be extended with official and third-party extensions.|$|E
40|$|In {{the modern}} society {{with a variety}} of {{information}} electronic devices, <b>human</b> <b>interfaces</b> increase their importance in a boundary of a human and a device. In general, the human is required {{to get used to the}} device. Even if the device is designed as a universal device or a high-usability device, the device is not suitable for all users. The usability of the device depends on the individual user. Therefore, personalized and customized <b>human</b> <b>interfaces</b> are effective for the user. To create customized interfaces, we propose rapid prototyping <b>human</b> <b>interfaces</b> using stretchable strain sensors. The <b>human</b> <b>interfaces</b> comprise parts formed by a three-dimensional printer and the four strain sensors.

5|$|Initial {{development}} on WoA took place by porting code from Windows 7; Windows Mobile smartphones {{were used to}} test early builds of WoA {{because of lack of}} readily available ARM-based tablets. Later testing was performed using a custom-designed array of rack-mounted ARM-based systems. Changes to the Windows codebase were made to optimize the OS for the internal hardware of ARM devices, but a number of technical standards traditionally used by x86 systems are also used. WoA devices would use UEFI firmware, and have a software-based Trusted Platform Module to support device encryption and UEFI Secure Boot. ACPI is also used to detect and control plug and play devices and provide power management outside the SoC. To enable wider hardware support, peripherals such as <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> devices, storage and other components that use USB and I²C connections use class drivers and standardized protocols. Windows Update serves as the mechanism for updating all system drivers, software, and firmware.|$|E

However, Maynard dies after he gets locked in the centrifuge, and Nico manages to escape by tricking Spallaci's men. Back in Rome, Nico informs George that the monatomic gold {{is being used to}} build a weapon called the Ark. They return to the monastery and witness Father Gregor shoot Gianelli; Nico is taken away and George is knocked out. When he awakens, the dying Gianelli hands over a manuscript in Latin, and tells him that the Ark's purpose is to use the monatomic gold to destroy the unbelievers. George goes to rescue Nico and meets Anna Maria in the catacombs, who tells him her side of the story and that the Ark needs a <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> to be activated. George arrives at the ceremony to see Nico chained to the Ark, ready to become the new Angel of Death. Mevlut, who is in fact ex-Turkish security and only pretended to be a waiter and priest, enters the scene armed with a gun, but Anna Maria points her gun at him as well. George succeeds in stopping the ceremony in time and frees Nico, but Anna Maria and Mevlut shoot each other and die.|$|E

25|$|Since GNOME 2, {{productivity}} {{has been}} a key focus for GNOME. To this end, the GNOME <b>Human</b> <b>Interface</b> Guidelines (HIG) were created. All GNOME programs share a coherent style of graphical user interface (GUI) {{but are not limited}} to the employment of the same GUI widgets. Rather, the design of the GNOME GUI is guided by concepts described in the GNOME HIG, itself relying on insights from cognitive ergonomics. Following the HIG, developers can create high-quality, consistent, and usable GUI programs, as it addresses everything from GUI design to recommended pixel-based layout of widgets.|$|E
25|$|With {{the release}} of {{new version of the}} GTK+ widget toolkit, which was used to {{construct}} the user interface of Galeon, the team decided to write a new version of Galeon from scratch.

The Galeon team had differing opinions on the new guidelines. The author and lead developer, Marco Pesenti Gritti, endorsed them and saw the rewrite as an opportunity to make Galeon simpler. Many other developers believed that reducing the number of preferences and simplifying the user interface would harm the project.|$|E

25|$|Around April 19, 2000 Blizzard {{released}} new screenshots of Warcraft III, {{these were}} completely without interface. These screenshots showed heroes {{and a number}} of abilities. More screenshots came around May 2000. These screenshots showed the new interface of the game, which looked like the <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> in the eventual final release, however had small cannons above the minimap and the command button space. The gold display was still eye-shaped, but the last screenshot before E3 2000 shows a rectangle-shaped gold display. Most models, icons, textures and abilities that you can find on these screenshots never appeared in the retail version. Then from E3 2000 around May 12, 2000 to ECTS 2000 the game didn't change very much. The next major changes came between ECTS 2000 and E3 2001, when a different interface and the Night Elf race was revealed.|$|E
25|$|The <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> {{guidelines}} {{published by}} Apple for macOS {{are followed by}} many applications, giving them consistent user interface and keyboard shortcuts. In addition, new services for applications are included, which include spelling and grammar checkers, special characters palette, color picker, font chooser and dictionary; these global features are present in every Cocoa application, adding consistency. The graphics system OpenGL composites windows onto the screen to allow hardware-accelerated drawing. This technology, introduced in version 10.2, is called Quartz Extreme, a component of Quartz. Quartz's internal imaging model correlates well with the Portable Document Format (PDF) imaging model, {{making it easy to}} output PDF to multiple devices. As a side result, PDF viewing and creating PDF documents from any application are built-in features.

25|$|Some modern amateur {{transceivers}} have embedded {{computers with}} firmware which is executed {{to provide the}} functions and features of the transceiver. This software must be provided by the original manufacturer of the equipment. Another type of software is that required to control a receiver (or transceiver) without a front panel provided. Examples of this are the Kenwood TS-B2000 and the Ten-Tec Pegasus; both transceivers are sold with PC software to provide the <b>human</b> <b>interface</b> for operation. Most transceivers with front control panels (and many receivers popular among shortwave listeners) have a computer interface such as a serial port, USB or Ethernet port. These ports are useful for satellite-tracking frequency control (Doppler tuning), station logging, digital operation, internet and special-needs accessibility. In many cases, the software adds improved or extra functions and features beyond that provided by the original design. For this reason, some operators purchase radio-control software for non-computerized operation even if their radio has a front control panel.|$|E
