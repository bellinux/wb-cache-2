5|$|Prince <b>Gumball</b> (voiced by Neil Patrick Harris)– <b>Gumball</b> is the gender-swapped {{version of}} Princess Bubblegum. He is the {{frequent}} {{victim of the}} Ice Queen's kidnapping schemes and appears that he harbors some sort of feelings for Fionna.|$|E
5|$|Enraged by the deception, Fionna {{takes out}} the crystal sword to fight. The sword {{turns out to be}} another one of Ice Queen’s tricks and turns into a ball of ice around Fionna’s hands. Cake hears noises from downstairs and senses Fionna is in trouble. Undaunted, Fionna uses the ice to beat Ice Queen over the head. Ice Queen pushes her off with a burst of snow which allows Fionna to get close to enough to break Prince <b>Gumball</b> free and knock out the Ice Queen with a broken icicle. Cake bursts in and sees <b>Gumball</b> {{standing}} next to Fionna in her torn dress; she jumps to the wrong conclusion and lunges at him but Fionna stops Cake and tells her it was the Ice Queen all along. Just then Ice Queen recovers and blasts Cake away from Fionna only to have Fionna knock her magic tiara off which negates her powers. The real <b>Gumball</b> asks Fionna on a date and is turned down; Fionna notes that she does not need a boyfriend at the moment.|$|E
5|$|<b>Gumball</b> is a 1983 {{video game}} by Robert Cook and Broderbund {{in which the}} player {{controls}} the valves of a maze-like machine to sort gumballs by their color. The player meets the quota of each level to earn their character—a factory worker—a promotion, resulting in a raise in difficulty with more color choices and defective gumballs to exclude. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived of the game's machine-sorting concept, and Cook, the designer, added the <b>gumball</b> conceit and built the core gameplay within a week. He later returned to add sound, decorative features, and a secret image that was only found three decades after the game's release. <b>Gumball</b> debuted at the June 1983 Consumer Electronics Show and released for the Apple II, Atari 8-bit family, and Commodore 64. Reviewers separately noted {{the difficulty of the}} game's later stages, praised its comical elements, and commented on the social role of simulating mundane work. The game did not become popular and its copies became rare.|$|E
50|$|Today, Ford Gum and Machine Co. is {{headquartered}} in Akron, NY {{and has a}} sales office in Buffalo Grove, IL. The company is the only large scale manufacturer of <b>gumballs</b> in the US. Their primary competitors, Tootsie Roll's Dubble Bubble and SweetWorks' Oak Leaf Confections, manufacture <b>gumballs</b> and confectionery products in Canada.|$|R
5000|$|... 'Two Ball Screwball' is a {{brand name}} (in the United States, a {{registered}} trademark) for a screwball containing two <b>gumballs.</b> The original flavor was cherry {{but it has also}} been introduced a multiple flavored twist of lemon and blue raspberry. As with all screwballs, the shape is that of an upside down cone with the <b>gumballs</b> at the bottom.|$|R

5|$|Once {{the basic}} {{functions}} ran reasonably well, Cook focused {{on making the}} game fun, with challenge and incentive to return. He added smaller features like sound effects and music, conveyor belt animations, and scorekeeping, but each new feature brought new software bugs to address. To make the game more interesting, Cook added the <b>gumball</b> bombs and tweaked the mechanism that caught them. He iterated through prototypes including a player-controlled claw and an item that traversed the pipes before finally deciding on crosshairs for the player to fire. Cook also added the game's time limit and the differences between levels. Closer to the end, Cook coded <b>Gumball</b> title page and the animated transitions between levels.|$|E
5|$|Robert Cook wrote <b>Gumball</b> for {{publication}} by Broderbund in 1983. Broderbund {{had a reputation}} as a successful publisher. Its games and productivity software each composed about half of the company's output, and their software in both categories reached the top of sales charts. Broderbund co-founder Doug Carlston conceived the core concept of a machine that sorts based on color, and Robert Cook expanded the concept with the <b>gumball</b> conceit. He spent a week designing the main processing machine, with its pipes and valves. Though he later returned to add more background detail, his original pipe design did not change. Most of Cook's time was spent programming the game's functions, such as the how individual gumballs move through the pipes.|$|E

5000|$|Internet {{personality}} Matt Dillahunty {{gives the}} example of a large jar full of <b>gumballs</b> to illustrate the burden of proof. The number of whole <b>gumballs</b> in the jar is either even or odd, but the degree of personal acceptance or rejection of claims about that characteristic may vary. We can choose to consider two claims about the situation, given as: ...|$|R

5|$|<b>Gumball</b> is {{an action}} video {{game for the}} home {{computer}} in which the player works in a factory as a <b>gumball</b> sorter and sorts gumballs by color as they flow through a maze-like processing machine. The player controls valves in the machine to divert the flow of individual gumballs towards bins of corresponding colors. If the player sorts incorrectly, the foreman walks onscreen and dumps the gumballs out the bin. The player has a daily quota to meet {{by the end of}} the level's time limit. If successful, the player character receives a promotion; the player watches an animation of a worker walking home from the factory, and progresses to a more complex level, with more color options to sort and defective, explosive gumballs to deactivate. If unsuccessful in meeting the daily quota, the game ends and the player is left to restart from the beginning.|$|E
5|$|Pretty on the Inside is {{the debut}} studio album by American {{alternative}} rock band Hole, released on September 17, 1991, in the United States on Caroline Records.

But Sergeant Stinkbug summons {{a few of his}} greatest warriors and gives them [...] "Grow-Big Gumballs", causing them to grow. The Mighty Robot battles well against them at first, but Sergeant Stinkbug gives them more <b>Gumballs,</b> making them bigger than they were before. Fudgie and Cupcake manage to swipe the <b>Gumballs</b> from under the stinkbugs' noses, and Ricky chomps them down. Once he is as big as the stinkbugs, he battles against them and wins. But then he soon realizes that he still needs {{to get rid of the}} foes. Then he sees that Lucy had the rest of the <b>Gumballs</b> (she enjoys <b>Gumballs</b> so much), and has grown way bigger than anyone else. She grabs the rest of the stinkbugs, stuffs them back inside the spaceship, and hurls them back to Saturn.

Popular elements of the obstacle course included The One-Ton Human Hamster Wheel, an oversized hamster wheel; Pick It, a giant human nose with a flag hidden inside; The Sundae Slide, a chocolate-covered ramp leading to a playground slide with ice cream; and Gum Drop, a gigantic <b>gumball</b> machine replica filled with plastic balls into which contestants would leap.|$|E
5|$|In 2016, an Apple II {{software}} cracker {{team found}} an Easter egg {{hidden by the}} game's creator 33 years prior. Cook had hidden a secret congratulations screen in the game for players who entered a specific keyboard key combination at a specific time and solved the resulting series of substitution ciphered clues. Cook congratulated the cracker team on Twitter. The crackers found the secret while working to preserve the game for the Internet Archive by removing its digital copyright protections. One of the crackers said that while most 1980s games could be cracked by automation, <b>Gumball</b> protections, coded by Roland Gustafsson, were exceptional.|$|E

50|$|<b>Gumballs</b> and chicles, {{a classic}} seller that {{can last for}} two years or more. Bubble gum sells well to children, while chewing gum sells better to adults. Dubble Bubble is {{reported}} to be a lower quality gum than Ford Gum and other brands. <b>Gumballs</b> sell best in machines by themselves, as opposed to being an option in a triple-selection machine. Gum is likely to become more popular among adults as more workplaces become smoke-free.|$|R
