5|$|During the 2004 {{crossover}} event , Black Mask commandeers Oracle's {{computers and}} satellites and engages {{in a fight}} to the death with Batman. In order to prevent Batman from killing his adversary, Oracle initiates the Clock Tower's self-destruct sequence, provoking Batman to rescue her rather than continue the battle. This results in the destruction of Gordon's home and headquarters in the clock tower. Subsequently, Oracle decides to move on, and leaves Gotham City altogether. She cuts her ties with Batman, and after a temporary world trip with her team, relocates to Metropolis. In the events comprising Gail Simone's Birds of Prey: Between Dark and Dawn (2005), and Birds of Prey: The Battle Within (2005), Oracle is possessed by arch-villain Brainiac, an artificial intelligence entity, in order to become a biological being. Although Oracle overpowers Brainiac and expels him from her body, the advanced virus delivered by him remains despite his absence. The virus steadily causes cybernetic attachments to sprout all over her body. Oracle develops supernatural abilities that allow her to psychically interact with computer information systems. Although she loses these abilities after the virus is rendered dormant following an operation by Doctor Mid-Nite, she discovers she can move <b>her</b> <b>toes.</b> However, this proves to be short-lived; Gordon remains paralyzed.|$|E

5|$|Knowles {{was born}} in Houston, Texas, to Mathew Knowles and Tina Knowles. Solange's older sister is singer Beyoncé. Her father, {{originally}} from Alabama, is African American, and her mother, originally from southern Louisiana, is Creole (with African, Native American, French, and 1/32 Irish ancestry). Her maternal grandparents are Lumis Beyincé and Agnéz Deréon, (a seamstress). She is also a descendant of Acadian leader Joseph Broussard. As a child, Knowles studied dance and theater. At the age of five, she made her singing debut at an amusement park. She began writing songs {{at the age of}} nine. At 13, she decided to pursue recording, but her parents initially advised her to wait. At the age of 15 Knowles replaced a departed dancer and performed with her sister's group Destiny's Child on tour. During the group's opening stint for American pop singer Christina Aguilera's tour, Knowles temporarily replaced Destiny's Child member Kelly Rowland after she broke <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> backstage during a costume change. When Knowles was 16, her father, who was then also her manager, signed her to his recording company, Music World Entertainment, along with Columbia.|$|E

25|$|Nut is {{also the}} barrier {{separating}} the forces of chaos from the ordered cosmos in the world. She was pictured as a woman arched on <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> and fingertips over the earth; her body portrayed as a star-filled sky. Nut's fingers and toes were believed to touch the four cardinal points or directions of north, south, east, and west.|$|E
25|$|If the {{infection}} in the feet and toes entered the bones, it could cause them to soften, which could result in toes dropping off; although, this {{was seen as a}} benefit because the feet could then be bound even more tightly. Girls whose toes were more fleshy would sometimes have shards of glass or pieces of broken tiles inserted within the binding next to her feet and between <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> to cause injury and introduce infection deliberately. Disease inevitably followed infection, meaning that death from septic shock could result from foot-binding, and a surviving girl was more at risk for medical problems as she grew older. It is thought that as many as 10% of girls may have died from gangrene and other infections due to footbinding.|$|E
25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} the foot while the foot was then drawn down {{straight}} with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the {{sole of the foot}}. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the girl could not move <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the girl could not loosen it.|$|E

25|$|One {{example is}} a grave in Fyrkat, Denmark {{which turned out to}} be the richest grave in the area. She had been buried in a wagon from which the wheels had been removed. She had been plainly clad in what was {{probably}} only a long dress. Around <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> she had toe rings, which suggests that she was buried without shoes or only in sandals so that the rings showed. At her head, she had a Gotlandic buckle which may have been used as a box, and she also owned objects from Finland and Russia. At her feet, she had a box which contained her magic tools, comprising a pellet from an owl as well as small bones from birds and mammals, and in a pouch she had the seeds of Hyoscyamus niger ("henbane"). If such seeds are thrown into a fire, they produce a hallucinogenic smoke which causes a sense of flying. In the grave there was also a small silver amulet that represented a chair made from a stump. When such small silver chairs are discovered in graves, they always belong to a woman, and it is possible that they represented objects such as the platform where the vǫlva performed her rituals and Hlidskjalf from which Odin watched across the world.|$|E
500|$|This was {{the final}} episode of the season to be filmed, though not the last to air. According to Jenna Fischer, {{everybody}} on the set was excited {{in a manner that}} she likened to students {{on the last day of}} school. The giddiness particularly shows in Fischer's performance: Pam skips after Jim into the break room, she bounces on <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> at the end of the [...] "fake crying" [...] talking head, and she taps the soda can three times to get Jim to release the jinx.|$|E

More digging convinces Monk he is on to something. Monk quickly annoys everyone and a fellow passenger informs Stefan of Monk's suspicions.|$|E

500|$|D'wayne Wiggins, who had {{produced}} their first recordings as Destiny's Child, {{filed suit in}} 2002 against his former counsel (Bloom, Hergott, Diemer & Cook LLP) seeking $15 million in damages for lessening his contractual agreement with the group without his consent, effectively nullifying his original contract that offered Sony Music/Columbia Destiny's Child's exclusive recording services for an initial seven years, in exchange for [...] "certain royalties", instead of royalties only from the first three albums. The case was settled for an undisclosed amount. In June 2003, Mathew Knowles announced that Destiny's Child would expand back to a quartet, revealing Knowles' younger sister, Solange, as the latest addition to the group. Destiny's Child had previously recorded songs with Solange and shared the stage when she temporarily replaced Rowland after she broke <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> while performing. Their manager, however, said the idea {{was used to test}} reactions from the public. In August 2003, Knowles herself confirmed that her sister would not be joining in the group, and instead promoted Solange's debut album, Solo Star, released in January 2003.|$|E
500|$|Her {{wings are}} spread to a {{triangular}} shape but not fully extended. The breasts are full and high, but without separately modelled nipples. Her {{body has been}} sculpted with attention to naturalistic detail: the deep navel, structured abdomen, [...] "softly modeled pubic area" [...] the recurve of {{the outline of the}} hips beneath the iliac crest, and the bony structure of the legs with distinct knee caps all suggest [...] "an artistic skill that is almost certainly derived from observed study". A spur-like protrusion, fold, or tuft extends from her calves just below the knee, which Collon interprets as dewclaws. Below the shin, the figure's legs change into those of a bird. The bird-feet are detailed, with three long, well-separated toes of approximately equal length. Lines have been scratched into the surface of the ankle and toes to depict the scutes, and all visible toes have prominent talons. <b>Her</b> <b>toes</b> are extended down, without perspective foreshortening; they do not appear to rest upon a ground line and thus give the figure an impression of being dissociated from the background, as if hovering.|$|E
2500|$|The {{sculpture}} stands upright {{looking toward}} her right. [...] The hair is wrapped loosely into a bun {{at the nape}} of the neck. [...] The figure is dressed in a toga that is banded at the waist and drapes behind the back. [...] The skirt is gathered into her left hand where the figure holds a cluster morning glory flowers. [...] The sandal-clad feet touch at the heels with <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> pointed out. [...] Behind her right foot lies an ear of corn.|$|E

2500|$|... 28th May, 1719. I {{went to see}} {{her last}} Sunday, the 23rd May, and found her in a sad state, {{suffering}} from pains in <b>her</b> <b>toes</b> and the soles of her feet until the tears came into her eyes. I went away because I saw that she refrained from crying out on my account. I thought {{she was in a}} bad way. A consultation was held by her three physicians, the result of which was that they determined to bleed her in the feet. They had some difficulty in persuading her to submit to it, because the pain in her feet was so great that she uttered the most piercing screams if the bedclothes only rubbed against them. The bleeding, however, succeeded, and she was in some degree relieved. It was the gout in both feet ...|$|E
2500|$|Mapp {{consulted}} on {{and fixed}} multiple cases. Some {{of her most}} noteworthy cases are recorded in James Caulfied's Portraits, Memoirs, and Characters of Remarkable Persons where he recorded an account from October 21, 1736, [...] "On Monday, Mrs. Mapp performed two extraordinary cures; one on a young lady of the Temple, who had several bones out from the knees to <b>her</b> <b>toes,</b> which she put in their proper places: {{and the other on}} a butcher, whose knee-pans were so misplaced that he walked with his knees knocking one against another. Yesterday she performed several other surprising cures; and about one set out for Epsom, and carried with her several crutches, which she calls trophies of honour." [...] At one point, some surgeons tried to fool Mapp and show that she was not skilled by sending her a healthy patient who claimed he had a damaged wrist. This test angered Mapp and she dislocated the patient's wrist and sent him back to the people who had tried to trick her.|$|E
