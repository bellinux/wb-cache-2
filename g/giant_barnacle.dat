40|$|Evidence is {{presented}} supporting {{the technical and}} economic possibilities of <b>giant</b> <b>barnacle</b> Austromegabalanuspsittacus (Molina, 1782) culture, {{one of the main}} alternatives for diversifying aquaculture in Chile. Spat collection from the wild varied between different sites in the north and south of the country and according to type of artificial collector. Growth also varied between sites (greater in the north), technological systems (greater in tubular systems) and depths (greater at 4 m). Average commercial size in the national market was reached over a period between 18 and 24 months. A long-line can produce between 7 to 10 gross ton during this period, therefore average annual fisheries production can be reached with only 10 to 30 long-lines, in an area of 1 to 3 ha. There is demand for this resource in the external market, particularly in the Japanese market, either as product similar to "fujit subo" (Balanus rostratus), or as a new resource; the relationship between production costs and price determines that <b>giant</b> <b>barnacle</b> culture has commercial potential.

40|$|The Chilean fjord region, {{situated}} between 42 and 56 °S, forms one of {{the most}} ragged shorelines and belongs to the ecologically and biogeographically least understood marine regions of the world. A labyrinth of fjords, channels, and islands extends over 240, 000 km 2 and creates a coastline of more than 80, 000 km. Due to strong abiotic gradients, numerous habitats are created, which are further diversified by temporal dynamics (tidal cycle, seasonal changes in precipitation, temperature, radiation, etc.). The region is a biodiversity hotspot hosting unique and fragile ecosystems. Among the species living here, several are species forming habitats in the ecosystem. These organisms can reach high densities conforming the so-called marine animal forests. Examples are marine animal forests dominated by cold-water stony corals, gorgonians, hydrocorals, brachiopods, polychaetes, <b>giant</b> <b>barnacles,</b> sponges, and ascidians.

40|$|Abstract. The {{south-eastern}} {{coast of}} Australia is recognised as a climate-change hotspot; warming {{over the past}} 50 years has exceeded the global average. Themarine fauna {{in the region is}} responding to this warmingwith several subtidal species showing a pole-ward range expansion. We provide the first evidence for a similar response in intertidal invertebrates, on the basis of surveys from the eastern coast of Tasmania in 2007 – 2008 that replicated a set from the 1950 s.

40|$|ABSTRACT Unidirectional {{chloride}} efflux and influx {{were studied}} in <b>giant</b> <b>barnacle</b> muscle fibers that were internally dialyzed. When cyclic 3 ' 5 '-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) {{was included in}} the dialysis fluid, both unidirectional fluxes were stimulated by about the same amount. This stimulation was not associated with measurable changes either in membrane electrical conductance or with net movements of chloride. The stimulation required the tram-side presence of chloride. The stimulated flux was inhibited by the sulfonic acid stilbene derivatives 4 -acetamido- 4 '-isothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonate (SITS) and 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulfonate (DIDS) or by furosemide. When cAMP was presented in high concentrations (10 - 6 M), the effect on chloride fluxes was characterized by a desensitization phenomenon. This desensitization was not the result of an increased amount of phosphodiesterase activity, but may be related to ATP and/or intraceUular calcium levels. These results further support the hypothesis that the barnacle sarcolemma possesses a specialized chloride transport mechanism that largely engages in CI-CI exchange under conditions of normal intracellular pH...|$|E

We investigated changes in metabolism and structure of B. nubilus muscle in response to: normoxic immersion, anoxic immersion, or air emersion, for acute (6 h) or chronic (6 h exposures twice daily for 2 wks) time periods. Following exposure, we immediately measured hemolymph pO 2, pCO 2, pH, Na+, Cl-, K+, and Ca+ then excised tergal depressor (TD) and scutal adductor (SA) muscles to determine citrate synthase (CS) activity, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) activity, and D-lactate levels. We also prepared a subset of SA and TD muscles from the chronic barnacles for histological analysis of fiber diameter (Feret’s), cross-sectional area (CSA), mitochondrial distribution and relative density, as well as nuclear distribution and myonuclear domain size. There was a significant decrease in hemolymph pO 2 and pCO 2 following acute and chronic anoxic immersion, whereas air emersion pO 2 and pCO 2 was comparable to normoxic levels. Fiber CSA and diameter did not change significantly in either tissue, while myonuclear domain size in SA muscle was significantly lower in the anoxic and emersion groups than the normoxic control. Neither CS, nor LDH activity, showed any significant treatment effect in either tissue, whereas both muscles had significantly higher D-lactate levels after air emersion following acute (though not chronic) exposure. Thus far, our findings indicate that B. nubilus experience a general reduction in aerobic metabolism under anoxia, emersion is only mildly oxygen-limiting, and that muscle plasticity is occurring during chronic emersion and anoxia...|$|R

The glass capillary prevented the chemically "skinned " fiber from swelling with a water content beyond 80 %. Isotope exchange studies using Z~Na, ~K, and aeCl indicated {{the existence of}} an intermediate rate constant and compartment which varied with pH. This intermediate rate was attributed to counter-ions and co-ions in the myofilament phase. Analysis of the electrolyte composition of the fiber at pH 8 predicts that the myofilaments contain about 0. 3 of the fiber water, and that a- 15 mV Donnan potential exists at the myofilament surface. An open-tipped (l-?tm) microelectrode in the skinned fiber measured a potential (similar in magnitude to the Donnan potential), which decreased and reversed sign as the pH was lowered. The measured cation contents of the fiber between pH 5 and 8 were found to be similar to the cation contents predicted from the measured Donnan potentials.

40|$|In single {{muscle fibers}} from the <b>giant</b> <b>barnacle,</b> a small {{decrease}} in muscle length decreases both the calcium activation and the peak isometric tension {{produced by a}} constant current stimulus. The effect is most pronounced if the length change immediately precedes the stimulation. In some cases, the decrease in tension with shortening can be accounted for almost entirely by a decrease in calcium release rather than changes in mechanical factors such as filament geometry. During the constant current stimulation the muscle membrane becomes more depolarized at longer muscle lengths than at the shorter muscle lengths. Under voltage clamp conditions, when the membrane potential is kept constant during stimulation, there is little length dependence of calcium release. Thus, the effect of length on calcium release is mediated through a change in membrane properties, rather than an effect on a subsequent step in excitation-contraction coupling. Stretch causes the unstimulated fiber membrane to depolarize by about l mV while release causes the fiber membrane to hyperpolarize by about the same amount. The process causing this change in potential has an equilibrium potential nearly 10 mV hyperpolarized from the resting level. This change in resting membrane potential with length {{may account for the}} length dependence of calcium release...|$|E
40|$|The {{intracellular}} dialysis {{technique was}} used to measure unidirectional Cl- fluxes and net acid extrusion by single muscle fibers from the <b>giant</b> <b>barnacle.</b> Decreasing pHi below normal levels of 7. 35 stimulated both Cl- efflux and influx. These increases of Cl- fluxes were blocked by disulfonic acid stilbene derivatives such as SITS and DIDS. The SITS- sensitive Cl- efflux was sharply dependent upon pHi, increasing approximately 20 -fold as pHi was decreased from 7. 35 to 6. 7. Under conditions of normal intracellular Mg 2 + concentration, the apparent pKa for the activation of Cl- efflux was 7. 0. We found that raising [Mg 2 +]i, but not [Mg 2 +]o, had a pronounced inhibitory effect on both SITS-sensitive unidirectional Cl- fluxes as well as on SITS-sensitive net acid extrusion. Increasing [Mg 2 +]i shifted the apparent pKa of Cl- efflux to a more acid value without affecting the maximal flux that could be attained. This relation between pHi and [Mg 2 +]i on SITS- sensitive Cl- efflux is consistent with a competition between H ions and Mg ions. We conclude that the SITS-inhibitable Cl- fluxes are mediated by the pHi-regulatory transport mechanism and that changes of intracellular Mg 2 + levels can modify the activity of the pHi regulator/anion transporter...|$|E

Propionate influx {{was not nearly as}} large as the stimulated C 1 efflux and was unaffected by SITS. Neither the effects of SITS nor those of the anion substitutes could be simply accounted for by changes in the membrane resting potential or conductance. These results suggest a mediated transport system for chloride across the barnacle sarcolemma...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — We {{propose a}} {{technique}} for reformulation {{of state and}} parameter estimation problems as that of matching explicitly computable definite integrals with known kernels to data. The technique applies for a class of systems of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and is aimed to exploit parallel computational streams {{in order to increase}} speed of calculations. The idea is based on the classical adaptive observers design. It has been shown that in case the data is periodic {{it may be possible to}} reduce dimensionality of the inference problem to that of the dimension of the vector of parameters entering the right-hand side of the model nonlinearly. Performance and practical implications of the method are illustrated on a benchmark model governing dynamics of voltage in generated in <b>barnacle</b> <b>giant</b> muscle. NOTATION Symbol ∥ · ∥ stands for the Euclidian norm. By K we denote the set of all strictly increasing continuous functions κ: R≥ 0 → R≥ 0 such that κ(0) = 0. Consider a nonautonomous system ˙x = f(x, p, t, u(t)), where f: R n × R d × R × R l → R n, u: R → R l are continuous, p ∈ R d is the vector of parameters, and f(·, p, t, u) is locally Lipschitz; x(·; t 0, x 0, p, [u]) stands for the unique maximal solution of the initial value problem: x(t 0; t 0, x 0, p, [u]) = x 0. In cases when no confusion arises, we will refer to these solutions as x(·; t 0, x 0, [u]), x(·; x 0, [u]), or simply x(·). Solutions of the initial value problem above at t are denoted as x(t; t 0, x 0, p, [u]), x(t; t 0, x 0, [u]), x(t; x 0, [u]), or x(t) respectively. Let f: R → R n, then ∥f(τ) ∥ ∞,[t 0,t 0 +T] denotes the uniform norm of f(·) on [t 0, t 0 +T]: ∥f(τ) ∥ ∞,[t 0,t 0 +T] = ess sup{∥f(t) ∥, t ∈ [t 0, t 0 + T]}. I...|$|R
40|$|Stable {{isotopes}} of Mg {{were used}} to measure bidirectional magnesium ion fluxes in single <b>barnacle</b> <b>giant</b> muscle fibers immersed in Ca- and Na-free, isosmotic media. Measurements were made using a mass spectrometric technique, thermal ionization mass spectrometry (TIMS), in conjunction with atomic absorption spectroscopy. Kinetic relations based on a first-order model were developed that permit the determination of unidirectional rate coefficients for Mg influx, ki, and efflux, ke, in the same experiment from knowledge of initial conditions and the initial and final ratios of 26 Mg/ 24 Mg and 25 Mg/ 24 Mg in ambient solutions (i. e., by isotope dilution). Such determinations were made for three values of the external Mg ion concentration: 5, 25, and 60 mM. At the concentration [Mg+ 2]o = 5 mM, ki and ke were about equal at a value of 0. 01 min- 1. At the higher values of [Mg+ 2]o, the values of ke increased along a curve suggesting saturation, whereas the values of ki remained essentially constant. As could be expected {{on the basis of}} a constant ki, the initial influx rate varied in direct linear proportion to [Mg+ 2]o, and was 11. 8 pmol/cm 2 s when [Mg+ 2]o was 5 mM. However, the initial efflux rate appeared to increase nonlinearly with [Mg+ 2]o, varying from 13. 4 pmol/cm 2 s ([Mg+ 2]o = 5 mM) to approximately 80 pmol/cm 2 s ([Mg+ 2]o = 60 mM). The results are consistent with a model that assumes Mg influx to be mainly an electrodiffusive inward leak with PMg = 0. 07 cm/s and Mg efflux to be almost entirely by active transport processes. Where comparisons can be made, the rate coefficients determined from stable isotope measurements agree with those previously obtained using radioactive Mg. The rate coefficients can be used to correctly predict time-dependent changes in total fiber Mg content. The results support the conclusion that nonradioactive tracers can be used to measure ion fluxes and ion flux ratios in excitable cells; it is expected that this method will greatly assist in the study of Mg regulation in general...|$|R
