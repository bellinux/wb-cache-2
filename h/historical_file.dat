40|$|Abstract. Grid {{applications}} {{often require}} large data transfers along heterogeneous networks having different latencies and bandwidths, therefore efficient support for data transfer {{is a key}} issue in Grid computing. The paper presents a performance evaluation of the GridFTP protocol along some typical network scenarios, giving indications and rules of thumb useful to select the “best ” GridFTP parameters. Following some recent approaches that make use of experimental results to optimize data transfers, the paper presents a simple algorithm that suggests the “best ” GridFTP parameters for a required transfer session {{on the basis of}} <b>historical</b> <b>file</b> transfer data. ...|$|E

40|$|Until {{recently}} {{archival storage}} tiers have consisted of tapebased devices {{with a large}} storage capacity, but limited I/O performance for data retrieval. However, the growing capacity and shrinking cost of disk-based devices means that disk-based systems are now a realistic option for enterprise archival storage tiers. Given the increasingly diverse options for archival storage, robust benchmarking of possible technologies for archival storage tiers is vital for reducing risk before deployment. This paper investigates benchmarks that utilize archival workloads developed from an analysis of <b>historical</b> <b>file</b> size distributions. These benchmarks not only provide more appropriatemeasurementsofsystemperformanceas an archive than traditional approaches, but we also incorporate the variation observed in the historical data to provide “best” and“worst”case workloads for benchmarking. By considering not only the usual workload, butalso workloads {{at either end of}} the archival workload spectrum, our benchmarking is robust, i. e., it provides measures of performance for the envelope of typical archival workload observed from empirical data. 1...|$|E

The basic design concept is for an integrated file system in which a single machine-held record is created and maintained for each bibliographic item. Item records are variously processed for such products as acquisitions purchase orders, fiscal reports, catalog card sets, charge cards, and pocket labels. The system is built around an on-line master in-process file to which records and data can be variously entered as needed for ordering, order record update, cataloging, etc. At any time the master file contains records in many stages of completion; its current size is over 40, 000 records. Altogether more than 100, 000 complete machinereadable bibliographic records have been created through the system.
