5|$|A {{period is}} a <b>horizontal</b> {{row in the}} {{periodic}} table. Although groups generally have more significant periodic trends, there are regions where <b>horizontal</b> trends are more significant than vertical group trends, such as the f-block, where the lanthanides and actinides form two substantial <b>horizontal</b> series of elements.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} {{sequence}} of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed. Deformation typically occurs {{as a result}} of <b>horizontal</b> shortening, <b>horizontal</b> extension, or side-to-side (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.|$|E
5|$|Females {{predominantly}} scent mark {{with their}} anogenital scent glands, by squatting to rub their anogenital region along <b>horizontal</b> surfaces, such as tree limbs. Males, {{on the other}} hand, favor using the glands on their neck, muzzle, and chest, by embracing <b>horizontal</b> and vertical surfaces and rubbing themselves over them. Both sexes will occasionally scent mark in ways characteristic of the opposite sex.|$|E

5|$|<b>Horizontal</b> orb webs {{are fairly}} common, despite being less {{effective}} at intercepting and retaining prey and {{more vulnerable to}} damage by rain and falling debris. Various researchers have suggested that <b>horizontal</b> webs offer compensating advantages, such as reduced vulnerability to wind damage; reduced visibility to prey flying upwards, because of the back-lighting from the sky; enabling oscillations to catch insects in slow <b>horizontal</b> flight. However, {{there is no single}} explanation for the common use of <b>horizontal</b> orb webs.|$|E

5|$|One change {{made during}} {{production}} was augmented pitch control to avoid deep stall conditions at high angles of attack. The stall issue {{had been raised}} during development, but had originally been discounted. Model tests of the YF-16 conducted by the Langley Research Center revealed a potential problem, but no other laboratory was able to duplicate it. YF-16 flight tests were not sufficient to expose the issue; later flight testing on the FSD aircraft demonstrated {{there was a real}} concern. In response, the areas of the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer were increased 25% on the Block 15 aircraft in 1981 and later retrofitted to earlier aircraft. In addition, a manual override switch to disable the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizer flight limiter was prominently placed on the control console, allowing the pilot to regain control of the <b>horizontal</b> stabilizers (which the flight limiters otherwise lock in place) and recover. Besides reducing the risk of deep stalls, the larger <b>horizontal</b> tail also improved stability and permitted faster takeoff rotation.|$|E

50|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the eighteenth}} century, {{printers}} developed what are now called transitional and then Didone types. These typefaces had a far greater amount of stroke contrast than before, with the difference in stroke width much greater than in earlier types. The resulting, daringly slender <b>horizontals</b> and serif details could show off the increasingly high quality of paper and printing technology of the period. In addition, these typefaces had a strictly vertical stress: without exception, the vertical lines were thicker than the <b>horizontals,</b> creating a much more geometric and modular design.|$|R

5|$|The architects {{sought to}} create an approachable {{building}} that reflected {{the role of the}} PUB as a public supplier of gas and electricity, and this led them to choose strong <b>horizontal</b> elements for the design. In the building's façade, this is achieved with distinctive rows of vertical fins, staggered so as to emphasise <b>horizontal</b> movement; these fins also provide shade. A secondary <b>horizontal</b> pattern results from grouping two or more rows of these fins in blocks.|$|E
5|$|The best-known {{method of}} prey capture is {{by means of}} sticky webs. Varying {{placement}} of webs allows different species of spider to trap different insects in the same area, for example flat <b>horizontal</b> webs trap insects that fly up from vegetation underneath while flat vertical webs trap insects in <b>horizontal</b> flight. Web-building spiders have poor vision, but are extremely sensitive to vibrations.|$|E

5|$|A {{controller}} in {{the cockpit}} allowed the visor to be retracted and the nose to be lowered to 5° below the standard <b>horizontal</b> position for taxiing and take-off. Following take-off and after clearing the airport, the nose and visor were raised. Prior to landing, the visor was again retracted and the nose lowered to 12.5° below <b>horizontal</b> for maximal visibility. Upon landing the nose was raised to the 5° position to avoid the possibility of damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{long line}} of subwoofers placed {{horizontally}} along {{the front edge of}} the stage can be delayed such that the center subs fire several milliseconds prior to the ones flanking them, which fire several milliseconds prior to their neighbors, continuing in this fashion until the last subwoofers are reached at the outside ends of the subwoofer row (beamforming). This method helps to counteract the extreme narrowing of <b>horizontal</b> dispersion pattern seen with a <b>horizontal</b> subwoofer array. Such delay shading can be used to virtually reshape a loudspeaker array.|$|E

50|$|The {{effect is}} {{specific}} to {{the region of the}} retina that is exposed to the induction stimuli. This has been shown by inducing opposite effects in adjacent regions of the retina (i.e., from one region of the retina verticals appear pink and <b>horizontals</b> appear greenish; from an adjacent region of the retina, verticals appear greenish and <b>horizontals</b> appear pink). Nevertheless, if a small region of the retina is exposed to the induction stimuli, and the test contours run through this region, the effect spreads along those test contours. Of course, if the induced area is in the fovea (central vision) and the eyes are allowed to move, then the effect will appear everywhere in the visual scene visited by the fovea.|$|R
