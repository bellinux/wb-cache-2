The character {{and duration of}} transients {{in the area of}} <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> molding with thickness less than 2 mm in the stability of their geometri c parameters and physicochemical properties have been researched. The time-temperature regimes of drawing of <b>thin</b> nominals <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> have been determined. It was found that their molding should be carried out in the temperature range of 840 – 850 °C (glass viscosity 10 { 4. 8 }– 10 { 5 } Pa · s), since the detaching effect of surface tension forces does not lead to significant narrowing ribbon of the glass. According to the parameters of glass surface quality, glass drawn in this temperature range resembles float glass to some extent. However, it is characterized by the lower thickness (0. 5 mm). The temperature increase to 900 – 950 °C (in the active forming zone) causes the decrease of the surface quality and a significant narrowing of the glass ribbon at the expense of forces of surface tension. Being formed in the temperature range of 800 – 750 °C on the roller drawing device the glass ribbon requires more effort high. It reduces the efficiency of the process. The researches of toughness of <b>thin</b> nominals <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> demonstrate that the low-temperature ion-exchange treatment in the KNO 3 melt at the temperature of 400 – 500 °C causes significant increase of strength, microhardness and glass heat resistance.

50|$|Several Wacom models, {{including}} the Intuos4 and Bamboo, were criticized for the drawing surface's roughness, which caused the small pressure-sensitive 'nib' to wear down, and become slanted or scratchy {{in the same}} way as pencil lead, albeit more slowly. This could also cause the surface to become smoother where it is used more, resulting in uneven slick and non-slick areas. As the nibs were only short lengths of plastic, it was possible for a user wanting a more durable nib to improvise a replacement from a short length of nylon 'wire' (approx 0.065 inches or 1.7mm diameter) like that found in grass trimmer or 'weed-eater' refills, suitably straightened by hand and smoothed (rounded off) at one end with abrasive paper. Additionally, a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> or acetate can be placed over the drawing surface to avert surface or nib damage {{in the same way}} as screen protectors are used on phones, although in the case of glass this may induce a—usually modest—parallax error when tracing.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} we derive {{mathematical}} {{models for the}} <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> redraw process {{for the production of}} very <b>thin</b> <b>glass</b> <b>sheets.</b> In the redraw process, a prefabricated glass block is fed into a furnace, where it is heated and stretched by the application of draw rollers to reduce its thickness. Redrawn sheets may be used in various applications including smartphone and battery technology. Our aims are to investigate the factors determining the final thickness profile of a <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> produced by this process, as well as the growth of out-of-plane deformations in the sheet during redraw. Our method is to model the <b>glass</b> <b>sheet</b> using NavierâStokes equations and free-surface conditions, and exploit small aspect ratios in the sheet to simplify and solve these equations using asymptotic expansions. We first consider a simple two-dimensional sheet to determine which physical effects should be taken into account in modelling the redraw process. Next, we derive a mathematical model for redraw of a <b>thin</b> threedimensional <b>sheet.</b> We consider the limits in which the heater zone is either short or long compared with the sheet half-width. The resulting reduced models predict the thickness profile of the redrawn sheet and the initial shape required to redraw a product of uniform thickness.

40|$|Propagation and {{focusing}} of electromagnetic beams through layered anisotropic medium {{is of interest}} in the field of optical data storage, where thin layers are mounted on glass substrates, display technology, where polarised light passes through liquid crystals, and in biological and material sciences, where objects are portrayed through <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> <b>glass.</b> In the case of computing a focused or diffracted field of a three-dimensional optical problem, it would be required to evaluate two-dimensional integrals with amplitude and phase functions. Obtaining numerical results for these kinds of problems, is a difficult task because of the rapidly oscillating integrands and the singularities in the Fresnel transmission and the reflection coefficients. If a layered medium is an anisotropic crystal, the numerical analysis is complicated significantly, as it gives rise to birefringence and mode coupling. Research within this field is jointly being conducted by the Department of Engineering at the University College of Bergen [HIB] and the Department of Physics and Technology at the University of Bergen [UIB]. Their researchers have obtained both exact and asymptotic results for propagated and focused fields in uniaxial crystals, and they have been adopting various techniques to obtain numerical results. The double integrals, which can be used for obtaining the results, can be reduced to single integrals by means of applying parabolic approximations to the phase and amplitude functions, and even though the approximations tend to give numerical results, the procedure is time-consuming. As such obtaining numerical results from this sort of procedure might take a few minutes to several computing hours. To date, they have typically written software in Fortran, in order to achieve the numerical results, and this intermediary data is then used as input data for the MATLAB software, in order to present the final results. This process of having to code one program for producing results that are passed to another, just to able to produce the final results, is convoluted, the use of different programs in series for producing the final result creating unnecessary work for the user. As such, the researchers have requested a singular software solution that will handle both the numerical calculations and the graphical presentation of the propagated electromagnetic fields from the initial data, which describes the characteristics of the medium and the type of electromagnetic wave...|$|R

The shift from vertical slumping to horizontal slumping is implemented and various technologies required for the horizontal slumping process are developed. In the horizontal slumping process, a <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> of <b>glass</b> is placed in between two horizontal ceramic air bearings with a bearing to glass gap of about 50 pm, and the assembly is heated up to 600 *C. The glass is unconstrained in the horizontal plane and must be positioned without any solid contact. Specifically, the technologies developed are: an optical distance sensor for positioning of the glass, glass position control via air bearing fluid shear force and tilt of device, and device mechanisms for operation in 600 *C. Glass was slumped horizontally with bearing-to-glass gaps of > 50 [mu]m, 36 ± 2. 5 pm, and 30. 5 ± 2. 5 [mu]m. The best flatness achieved was 6. 7 / 3. 6 + 0. 5 [mu]m for front/back of the <b>glass</b> <b>sheet,</b> with a gap of 36 + 2. 5 [mu]pm. It was discovered that 600 *C is hotter than necessary and that 550 *C is still too hot for optimal slumping conditions. In addition, an important shift is made from using an oven, which heats the entire device, to using in-line pipe heaters, which supply heated air. This allows for much quicker heating and cooling times, which decreases slumping time to less than 30 minutes (10 minutes heating, 5 minutes slumping, 10 minutes cooling). by Edward Sung. Thesis (S.

After Emily is arrested, Jonathan solves the 1988 mystery, postulating that house Emily saw was actually a standing film set which blew over in the wind when she turned away. He suggests that the man in the field was actually the site watchman, reaching out to Emily in an attempt to free himself from beneath the set.

50|$|Other {{methods for}} making hand-blown glass {{included}} blown plate glass, crown glass (introduced to England in the 17th century), {{polished plate glass}} and cylinder blown <b>sheet</b> <b>glass.</b> These methods of manufacture lasted {{at least until the}} end of the 19th century. The early 20th century marks the move away from hand-blown to machine manufactured glass such as rolled plate glass, machine drawn cylinder <b>sheet</b> <b>glass,</b> flat drawn <b>sheet</b> <b>glass,</b> single and twin ground polished plate glass and float glass.|$|R
50|$|Broad <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> {{was first}} {{made in the}} UK in Sussex in 1226. This glass was of poor quality and fairly opaque. Manufacture slowly {{decreased}} and ceased by the early 16th century. French glass-makers and others were making broad <b>sheet</b> <b>glass</b> earlier than this.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Real-time {{displacement}} {{in stable}} crack tearing {{was measured by}} digital image correlation technique. Quantitative analyses were provided on mixed-mode I/II fracture and critical CTOA for recycled <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals. It is shown that the fracture of recycled <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals is tough due to the large plastic deformation, and mixed-mode crack is easier to extend than mode I crack. The critical CTOA at stable crack tearing is constant {{and can be used}} as a fracture criterion for the <b>thin</b> <b>sheet</b> metals...|$|R
