25|$|Barrientos' {{dilemma of}} {{allegiance}} was resolved when Álvaro de Luna returned from abroad, bringing {{with him the}} support of the Diocese of Toledo, which had practically unlimited resources, and which had granted him their patronage at the behest of his half brother, Juan de Cerezuela. Greatly aided by their financial backing and political cachet, he was able to mobilize royalist supporters of the crown to fight for the king. While the two sides geared up for war (ultimately taking place in Olmedo), Barrientos, his course now clear, traveled to the town of Madrigal de las Altas Torres (northern Ávila) to convince the heir, Prince Henry, to <b>forbear</b> from taking up arms against his own father.|$|E
25|$|Martin {{arrived at}} Naples on the {{afternoon}} of 19 August, with orders to capture, sink or burn any vessels carrying military stores and supplies he found there and 'to use his utmost to lay the said city in ashes, unless the King of the two Sicilies shall agree forthwith not only to withdraw his troops now acting in conjunction with those of the King of Spain in Italy, but to <b>forbear</b> from giving in future any assistance of what kind soever.' Martin sent his flag captain, Merrick de L'Angle, onshore to present the terms to the King, demanding that an answer be returned within half an hour. The small squadron was considerably more powerful than anything the Neapolitans could muster, and after calling an emergency council, the King and his ministers attempted to make conditions, sending a deputy back to Martin with de L'Angle. Martin instead stated that he was sent ‘as an officer to act, not a minister to treat’, and once more demanded the King comply with the demands. With no way of resisting, the Neapolitans confirmed their neutrality, and promised to withdraw their troops. His objective achieved, Martin weighed anchor at midnight, and sailed to rejoin Mathews at Hyères Bay.|$|E

500|$|From his {{vantage point}} William Hulton {{perceived}} the unfolding events as {{an assault on}} the yeomanry, and on L'Estrange's arrival at 1:50pm, at the head of his hussars, he ordered them into the field to disperse the crowd with the words: [...] "Good God, Sir, don't you see they are attacking the Yeomanry; disperse the meeting!" [...] The 15th Hussars formed themselves into a line stretching across the eastern end of St Peter's Field, and charged into the crowd. At about the same time the Cheshire Yeomanry charged from the southern edge of the field. At first the crowd had some difficulty in dispersing, as the main exit route into Peter Street was blocked by the 88th Regiment of Foot, standing with bayonets fixed.

500|$|Lincoln's reply {{would become}} famous, {{much more so}} than the prayer that {{provoked}} it. [...] "My paramount object in this struggle is to save the Union, and is not either to save or to destroy slavery. If I could save the Union without freeing any slave, I would do it, and if I could save it by freeing all the slaves I would do it; and if I could save it by freeing some and leaving others alone I would also do that. What I do about slavery, and the colored race, I do because it helps to save the Union; and what I <b>forbear,</b> I <b>forbear</b> because I do not believe it would help to save the Union." [...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom". According to Williams, [...] "Lincoln's war for Union was now also Greeley's war for emancipation." ...|$|E

500|$|Secondly, {{there was}} the case of Wenlock Christison, a Quaker who had {{repeatedly}} returned to Massachusetts despite banishment, whose trial in May, 1661 {{put an end to the}} execution of Quakers. [...] He was sentenced to death, but the law was changed soon after, and he was not executed. [...] He was the last Quaker to be sentenced to death in Massachusetts. [...] The Quakers believed that during an altercation between the accused and Atherton at the trial, Christison prophesied the outcome of his trial as well as the circumstances of Atherton's untimely death. [...] Quaker writer George Bishop wrote, [...] "Yea, Wenlock Christison, though they did not put him to death, yet they sentenced him to die, so that their cruel purposes were nevertheless. I cannot <b>forbear</b> to mention what he spoke, being so prophetical, not only as to the judgment of God coming on Major-general Adderton, but as to their putting any more Quakers to death after they had passed sentence on him." [...] Henry Wadsworth Longfellow recreated the Christison trial in his play [...] which included the damnation of Atherton by the accused.|$|E

[...] Two days later, upon hearing that British ships had left the Chesapeake, Washington was sure Howe's move was imminent. He rallied his troops, {{referencing}} Horatio Gates's successes against the British in the north, saying [...] "Who can <b>forbear</b> to emulate their [...] noble spirit? Who is there without ambition, to share with them, the applauses of their countrymen, and of all posterity, as the defenders of Liberty, and the procurers of peace and happiness to millions in the present and future generations? Two years we have maintained the war and struggled with difficulties innumerable.

[...] The 15th-century polymath Leonardo da Vinci may have secretly dissected around 30corpses, although their provenance remains unknown. [...] In Britain, the practice appears to have been common early in the 17th century. [...] For example, William Shakespeare's epitaph reads [...] "Good friend, for Jesus' sake <b>forbear,</b> To dig the dust enclosed here. [...] Blessed be the man that spares these stones, And cursed be he that moves my bones" [...] and in 1678, anatomists were suspected of being involved in the disappearance of an executed gypsy's body. [...] Contracts issued in 1721 by the Edinburgh College of Surgeons include a clause directing students not to become involved in exhumation, suggesting, according to historian Ruth Richardson, that students had already done the exact opposite. [...] Pupils accompanied professional body snatchers as observers, and were reported to have obtained and paid for their studies with human corpses, perhaps indicating that their tutors were complicit. [...] The unauthorised removal of bodies from London graveyards became commonplace and by the 1720s, probably {{as a direct result of}} the lack of legally available bodies for anatomical research, fresh corpses had likely undergone commodification.|$|E

500|$|Some texts {{state that}} Kalmashapada's birth name was Mitrasaha, {{but he was}} known by his patronymic Saudasa. A {{commentator}} on the Vishnu Purana says that Mitra-saha (literally, [...] "one who <b>forbears</b> a friend") is an epithet the king acquires from {{the curse of the}} sage Vashishtha. The king restrains (saha) himself from retaliation against his friend (mitra) Vashishtha's curse, though he possesses the power to do so. The Vayu Purana, the Agni Purana, the Brahma Purana, and the Harivamsa call him Amitrasaha, [...] "one who <b>forbears</b> (saha) a foe (amitra)"; here, Vashishtha is taken to be an enemy.|$|R

But Moses told God {{to think of what}} the Egyptians would think when they heard the news, and how they would think God powerless to bring the Israelites to the Promised Land. Moses asked God to <b>forbear,</b> quoting God's self-description as [...] "slow to anger and abounding in kindness, forgiving iniquity and transgression."

2500|$|In modern practice, {{perhaps the}} most {{important}} distinction between law and equity is the set of remedies each offers. The most common civil remedy a court of law can award is monetary damages. Equity, however, enters injunctions or decrees directing someone either to act or to <b>forbear</b> from acting. Often, this form of relief is in practical terms more valuable to a litigant; for example, a plaintiff whose neighbor will not return his only milk cow, which had wandered onto the neighbor's property, may want that particular cow back, not just its monetary value. However, in general, a litigant cannot obtain equitable relief unless there is [...] "no adequate remedy at law"; that is, a court will not grant an injunction unless monetary damages are an insufficient remedy for the injury in question. Law courts can also enter certain types of immediately enforceable orders, called [...] "writs" [...] (such as a writ of habeas corpus), but they are less flexible and less easily obtained than an injunction.|$|E
