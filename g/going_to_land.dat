5|$|The {{town was}} further {{reinforced}} with 300 sailors the next day, before another {{attack on the}} town was launched on 29 May. A few ships had been sent as a decoy to split the Royalist forces, but only succeeded in sending a small detachment of cavalry and foot away, though they quickly returned {{when it was clear}} that the ships were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b> Around midday, the batteries began to heavily bombard the town, followed by a ground attack which managed to breach the fortifications. After eight hours of fighting, the Parliamentarians rebuffed the attack. Fourteen more ships arrived two days later, bringing further provisions and ammunition, and news that a relieving force would be sent to aid the town. By this stage, Maurice realised that he was unlikely to be able to capture the town, and so was determined to destroy it instead; fires were set on 1 June and then no attacks other than light bombardments were made until 11 June, when heavier, red-hot shot was fired to try and set more fires in the town.|$|E
25|$|As {{soon as it}} was {{realised}} at Port Washington that Cavalier was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> in the sea, Port Washington {{requested a}} Pan American World Airways Sikorsky S-42 flying boat from Hamilton, Bermuda, to go to her assistance. The United States Coast Guard sent a flying boat from Long Island to Cavaliers last known position but it did not find her. A United States Army Air Corps Boeing B-17 Flying Fortress heavy bomber made a sortie from Langley Field in Virginia to search for Cavalier but had to return before midnight without success. Other aircraft also tried in vain to find the Cavalier.|$|E
25|$|On 6 July, Franklin began {{strikes on}} Guam and Rota Island to soften {{them up for}} the {{invasion}} forces that were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> on Guam, and those strikes continued until 21 July, when she lent direct support to enable safe landing of the first assault waves. Two days of replenishment at Saipan permitted her to steam in Task Force 58 (TF 58) for photographic reconnaissance and air strikes against the islands of the Palau Islands group. On 25 and 26 July, her planes struck enemy planes, ships, and ground installations. The Franklin departed on 28 July and headed for Saipan, and the following day she was shifted to TG 58.1.|$|E

500|$|As a youngster, Irvine {{played as}} a goalkeeper until his elder brother Bobby, {{who went on}} to keep goal for the Northern Ireland {{national}} team, threatened to [...] "batter" [...] him. He subsequently moved into a midfield position, before becoming a centre forward during his time in the Burnley youth team. Described as a natural and instinctive goalscorer, Irvine stated that one of his main strengths as a striker was the ability to anticipate where the ball was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
500|$|On 18 March, the Anglo-French fleet {{mounted a}} major {{attack on the}} Ottoman defences; Ocean joined ten British battleships and one battlecruiser and four French battleships for the operation. The plan called for the battleships to enter the narrows and {{suppress}} the fortresses while minesweepers cleared paths in the Ottoman minefields. At the same time, transport ships outside the straits would conduct a demonstration to convince the Ottomans they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> troops; the Entente commanders hoped this would tie down the Ottoman mobile guns. The British ships initially succeeded in inflicting heavy damage on the fortresses, but the battleship [...] and then the battlecruiser [...] began taking serious damage from the coastal batteries. The French battleships also began to take damage, and the battleship Bouvet struck a mine and exploded. Later in the day, [...] was disabled by a mine in Erenköy Bay. Once {{it became apparent that}} the ship could not be saved, all of her surviving crew was taken off by destroyers except for her commanding officer and some volunteers trying to keep her afloat. Ocean was sent in to tow her out, but she ran aground during the attempt, and, after freeing herself, found it impossible to take Irresistible under tow because of the shallow water, Irresistibles increasing list, and heavy enemy fire. Ocean then took off the remaining members of Irresistibles crew and left the abandoned battleship to her fate; Irresistible sank unobserved by Allied forces, at around 19:30.|$|E
2500|$|Planners for Operation Wadham {{wanted the}} Germans {{to believe that}} the Americans were going to invade in the area of Brest, a seaport on the Breton peninsula. The hoax {{involved}} minimal [...] "real" [...] forces, had a notional amphibious group sailing directly from the United States and another force from Great Britain with ten divisions in all, to conduct an invasion at Brest. The premise was that the Americans were planning to invade Brest following the successful invasion at Boulogne. Although the air commitment for this plan was considerably less than Starkey’s, Eaker also criticized Wadham by saying that the combined bomber offensive would more effectively destroy the Luftwaffe than the diverted bomber resources could provide in support of Wadham. Other than aircraft, the Americans only had to provide 75 dummy landing craft to aid in the deception effort. The primary weakness in Wadham’s story was that the US forces were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> outside of Allied tactical air support range. Prior to the operation, the Army Operations Branch called Wadham a [...] "very weak plan" [...] but [...] "essential as a part of Cockade to reinforce Starkey." ...|$|E

2500|$|The damage {{occurred}} {{when she was}} flying a mission over Baghdad on April 7, 2003. [...] "We did our job with the guys there on the ground, and as {{we were on our}} way out is when I felt the jet get hit. It was pretty obvious — it was loud... I lost all hydraulics instantaneously, and the jet rolled left and pointed toward the ground, which was an uncomfortable feeling over Baghdad. It didn't respond to any of my control inputs." [...] She tried several procedures to get the aircraft under control, none of which worked; last, she put the plane into manual reversion, meaning she was flying the aircraft without hydraulics. The aircraft immediately responded. [...] "The jet started climbing away from the ground, which was a good feeling because there was no way I wanted to eject over Baghdad." [...] With some technical advice from her flight leader, Lieutenant Colonel Turner, she flew the injured plane for an hour back to the air base. [...] "The jet was performing exceptionally well. I had no doubt in my mind I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> that airplane." [...] Landing was tricky: [...] "When you lose all the hydraulics, you don't have speed brakes, you don't have brakes, and you don't have steering." ...|$|E
2500|$|Strange as it {{may seem}} England had few qualms about the Australian bowling {{at the start of the}} series. Dennis Lillee and Bob Massie had been overbowled in 1972 and 1973 and had both broken down with {{crippling}} injuries, while Jeff Thomson – if they had heard of him – had taken 0/110 in his only Test. However, Lillee returned to Test cricket after considerable determination to overcome his injuries and though he lost a yard or two of pace he had lost none of his old venom and [...] "bowled with a hostility that bordered on savagery". His new bowling action was a text-book model and his straight arm gave him movement through the air and off the pitch that made him more dangerous than ever. But the real revelation was Thomson, whose javelin throw action gave him enormous pace and [...] "slung the ball down at sizzling pace, getting dangerous lift off a length, and not worrying overmuch where the ball landed" [...] In 1975–76 his bowling was clocked at 99.6mph compared to Lillee's 86.4 and his very inaccuracy made him dangerous, the batsmen never knew where the ball was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>land</b> next. They were given wholehearted support by Max Walker, as fast-medium bowler whose awkward whirlwind bowling action gave him the nickname of Tangles. 6'4" [...] tall and as strong as a bull Walker was an accurate swing bowler and took 8/143 in the last Test when Lillee and Thomson were injured. Geoff Dymock was a left-arm swing bowler who struggled to keep his pace in a strong Australian team, but became the first Australian to dismiss all 11 opposition batsmen in a Test when he took 12/166 at Kanpur in 1979–80. Doug Walters was a part-time bowler, but his medium-paced [...] "Golden Arm" [...] was capable of breaking any partnership and he deserved to be regarded an all-rounder. Greg Chappell was also seen as an all-rounder in his youth, and continued to bowl throughout his Test career, but mainly to tie up one end while the other bowlers rested. The orthodox off-spinner Ashley Mallett could turn the ball very sharply. Tom Graveney thought he was the finest Australian off-spinner since the war and came second in the averages after Thomson. Historically Australian selectors preferred a leg-spinner, but Terry Jenner failed to hold his place and as fast-bowling rose in prominence the Australian 'leggie' became almost extinct.|$|E
