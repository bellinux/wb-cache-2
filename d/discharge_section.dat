40|$|A {{study of}} benthic fauna, with special {{emphasis}} on polychaetes, {{was made in the}} discharge lagoon of an experimental shrimp farm and a pond of the farm. The discharge lagoon was divided into three sections and stocked with shrimp at low density (6 Pl/m 2). Neither formulated feed nor fertilization was used in these sections. The control pond was stocked with shrimp at high density (32 Pl/m 2). The pond was fertilized and fed with a commercial shrimp diet. Enclosures of 4 m 2 were made in the sections and control ponds with plastic nets to exclude shrimp. Water quality parameters (temperature, salinity, dissolved oxygen, pH and organic matter) and the nutrients (N-NO 2, N-NO 3, TAN and P-PO 4), were recorded during the study. Abundance and composition of benthic fauna were recorded biweekly in sections and pond. Significant differences in nutrients and organic matter were found among control pond and the <b>discharge</b> <b>sections,</b> with the highest values in the pond. The main benthic groups collected during the study were Chironomidae insect larvae, polychaete worms (Polydora socialis), gammarid crustaceans and gasteropods (Cerithidea sp). Total abundance of benthic organisms was greater in the <b>discharge</b> <b>sections</b> (5657 to 6202) compared with the control pond (5336). The abundance of polychaetes showed the same tendency (2318 to 2681 versus 1697). Total benthic abundance was always lower in sections and pond than in the respective enclosures (6882 to 7606 organisms). The same pattern was found for polychaetes abundance (3386 to 4006 organisms). Temporal variation of polychaetes abundance was mainly related to shrimp predation as confirmed by the more abrupt abundance decline in pond as compared to sections and in pond and sections as compared to the respective enclosures...|$|R

40|$|Separation of gas–liquid mixture, {{which is}} {{achieved}} by using either large gravity separators or compact separators is a common and vital operation in the petroleum industry. Where space and cost are key project considerations, gas–liquid compact separators are very attractive because of their versatility and cost effectiveness. Efficient performance of the cyclonic separator depends on smooth and steady swirling flow. Unsteady swirling flow in the separator may be due to capacity constraint, improper design or unforeseen flow instability at the inlet. An understanding of phase distribution in gas <b>discharge</b> <b>section</b> of these separators would help design engineers make a better decision when selecting and sizing inlet nozzle, diameter and length of the separator.

50|$|Submerged Flow - {{when the}} water surface {{downstream}} of the flume is high enough to restrict flow through a flume, the flume is deemed to be submerged. Lacking the extended throat and <b>discharge</b> <b>sections</b> of the Parshall flume, the Montana flume has little resistance {{to the effects of}} submergence and as such it should be avoided. Where submerged flow is or may become present, there are several methods of correcting the situation: the flume may be raised above the channel floor, the downstream channel may be modified, or a different flume type may be used (typically a Parshall flume). Although commonly thought of as occurring at higher flow rates, It should be noted that submerged flow can exist at any flow level as it is a function of downstream conditions. In natural stream applications, submerged flow is frequently the result of vegetative growth on the downstream channel banks, sedimentation, or subsidence of the flume.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The low {{biodegradability}} {{and high}} persistence in environment of PCBs (polychlorinated biphenyls) make their removal difficult and incomplete in conventional (chemical-biological) {{wastewater treatment plants}} (WWTP), and frequent oversteps (5 - 250 ng/L) of the admissible limits in effluents (1 ng/L) are reported worldwide. In general, accidental discharges of low loads {{might not be so}} critical, due to the fast pollutant dispersion over a short river-section downstream the release point. In contrast, this problem can turn into a serious one if the pollutant is a POP (persistent organic pollutants, as the PCBs), even for small concentrations in the WWTP effluent, due to its known high bioaccumulation capacity in the environment. The paper illustrates, for the case of a low-level but frequent PCB- 52 discharge from a WWTP, the high pollution potential for the river. By using a combined advective-dispersive dynamic model, including the phase-exchange and bioaccumulation terms in biota and sediments, it is proved how a small but quasi-continuous release of PCB can become dangerous on a long term. The model allows predicting the “moving pollution front ” effect propagated downstream the river, as soon as the aquatic phase-exchange equilibrium tends to be reached in the critical <b>discharge</b> <b>section...</b>|$|E

40|$|This article proposes an {{effective}} methodology for the fluid-dynamic design optimization of the sliding spool of a hydraulic proportional directional valve: {{the goal is}} the minimization of the flow force at a prescribed flow rate, so as to reduce the required opening force while keeping the operation features unchanged. A full three-dimensional model of the flow field within the valve is employed to accurately predict the flow force acting on the spool. A theoretical analysis, based on both the axial momentum equation and flow simulations, is conducted to define the design parameters, which need to be properly selected {{in order to reduce}} the flow force without significantly affecting the flow rate. A genetic algorithm, coupled with a computational fluid dynamics flow solver, is employed to minimize the flow force acting on the valve spool at the maximum opening. A comparison with a typical single-objective optimization algorithm is performed to evaluate performance and effectiveness of the employed genetic algorithm. The optimized spool develops a maximum flow force which is smaller than that produced by the commercially available valve, mainly due to some major modifications occurring in the <b>discharge</b> <b>section.</b> Reducing the flow force and thus the electromagnetic force exerted by the solenoid actuators allows the operational range of direct (single-stage) driven valves to be enlarged...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, organic Rankine cycle (ORC) turbogenerators {{have become very}} {{attractive}} for the exploitation of low-temperature heat sources in the small to medium power range. Organic Rankine cycles usually operate in thermodynamic regions characterized by high pressure ratios and strong real-gas effects in the flow expansion, therefore requiring a nonstandard turbomachinery design. In this context, {{due to the lack}} of experience, a promising approach for the design can be based on the intensive use of computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and optimization procedures to investigate a wide range of possible configurations. In this work, an advanced global optimization strategy is coupled with a state-of-the-art CFD solver in order to assist in the design of ORC turbines. In particular, a metamodel assisted genetic algorithm, based on the so-called 'off-line trained' metamodel technique, has been employed. The numerical solutions of the two-dimensional (2 D) Euler equations are computed with the in-house built code zFlow. The working fluid is toluene, whose thermodynamic properties are evaluated by an accurate equation of state, available in FluidProp. The computational grids created during the optimization process have been generated through a fully automated 2 D unstructured mesh algorithm based on the advancing-Delaunnay strategy. The capability of this procedure is demonstrated by improving the design of an existing one-stage impulse radial turbine, where a strong shock appears in the stator channel due to the high expansion ratio.
