50|$|Mixing: The {{ingredients}} are all placed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> {{at once and}} combined together. A variation of this technique is to add ingredients sequentially. This mixing process may be done by hand kneading or by machine. Once fermentation has commenced, it will continue until {{the heat of the}} oven kills the yeast during baking. For fast fermentations, long, intense mixing techniques are recommended for dough development, whereas for long-fermented doughs, short-mixing techniques on slow speeds or hand kneading may be used with sufficient later folding.|$|E

5000|$|Most bare {{cast-iron}} {{pots and}} pans are cast as {{a single piece of}} metal, including the handle. This allows them to be used on both the stovetop and in the oven. Many recipes call for the use of a cast-iron skillet or pot, especially so that the dish can be initially seared or fried on the stovetop then transferred into the oven, pan and all, to finish baking. Likewise, cast-iron skillets can double as baking dishes. Cornbread in particular is seen as a food item that is best prepared in a cast-iron skillet: the iron pan is heated beforehand in the oven, the ingredients are first combined and mixed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl,</b> then added to the heated pan, and the dish is then placed directly into the oven for fast baking.

50|$|Food {{processing}} {{is typically}} a mechanical process that utilizes large mixing, grinding, chopping and emulsifying {{equipment in the}} production process. These processes inherently introduce a number of contamination risks. <b>As</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> or grinder is used over time the food contact parts will tend to fail and fracture. This type of failure will introduce into the product stream small to large metal contaminants. Further processing of these metal fragments will result in downstream equipment failure {{and the risk of}} ingestion by the consumer. Food manufacturers utilize industrial metal detectors to detect and reject automatically any metal fragment. Large food processors will utilize many metal detectors within the processing stream to reduce both damage to processing machinery as well as risk to consumer health.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We {{present a}} method for {{predicting}} action outcomes in unstructured environments with variable numbers of partici-pants and hidden relationships between them. For example, when pouring flour from a cup into <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl,</b> important relations must exist between the cup and the bowl. The action Pour(x, y) might depend on the precondition Above(x, y). How well the predicate Above actually predicts action success often depends on complicated world dynamics and perhaps other objects in the scene. While such predicates are commonly hand-crafted, we present <b>in</b> this paper <b>a</b> method for learning physically grounded predicates directly from the continuous data. <b>In</b> this manner, <b>an</b> agent’s own developmental experience can drive its world representations. Here, we learn such representations as ensem-bles (or forests) of probability trees using the Spatiotemporal Multidimensional Relational Framework (SMRF). By reasonin...|$|R

5000|$|Runemaster : The Runemaster is {{the class}} in the game that the player will most likely control during battle, due to its spellcasting ability.

40|$|Lower back injuries, {{specifically}} lumbar stress fractures, {{account for}} the most lost playing time in professional cricket. The aims {{of this study were}} to quantify the proportion of lower trunk motion used during the delivery stride of fast bowling and {{to examine the relationship between}} the current fast bowling action classification system and potentially injurious kinematics of the lower trunk. Three-dimensional kinematic data were collected from 50 male professional fast bowlers during a standing active range of motion trial and three fast bowling trials. A high percentage of the fast bowlers used <b>a</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>bowling</b> action attributable to having shoulder counter-rotation greater than 30 °. The greatest proportion of lower trunk extension (26 %), contralateral side-flexion (129 %), and ipsilateral rotation (79 %) was used during the front foot contact phase of the fast bowling delivery stride. There was no significant difference in the proportions of available lower trunk extension, contralateral side-flexion, and ipsilateral rotation range of motion used during fast <b>bowling</b> by <b>mixed</b> and non-mixed action bowlers. Motion of the lower trunk, particularly side-flexion, during front foot contact, in addition to variables previously known to be related to back injury (e. g. shoulder counter-rotation), should be examined in future cross-sectional and prospective studies examining the fast bowling action and low back injury...|$|R
40|$|The geospace {{environment}} {{has been viewed}} as <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> <b>bowl</b> for plasmas of both solar and terrestrial origin. The present perspective {{on the nature of}} the supply mechanisms has undergone a radical evolution over the past decade, particularly during the five years of the Dynamics Explorer mission. During this period, the terrestrial source has increased in importance in both magnitude and character of ionospheric outflow. These outflows include the classical polar wind, the cleft ion fountain, the auroral ion fountain, and the polar cap. The earth can be envisioned as a multifaceted fountain which ejects particles from different spatial locations spread around the globe. These particles exhibit a range of masses from 1 to 32 amu and a range of energies from 1 eV to 10 keV. The total flux of this ionospheric outflow is very large: adequate to supply the entire magnetospheric particle population. And the implications of the outflow are significant across a broad spectrum of solar-terrestrial processes ranging from sources of magnetospheric plasmas, to influences on ionospheric density and temperature structure, to energy transfer in phenomena such as stable auroral red arcs. The Dynamics Explorer mission has made <b>a</b> major contribution <b>in</b> the characterization of the terrestrial plasma source...|$|R
