When tested with the pairmate, the sensitivity of the response was reduced in titis but not in squirrel monkeys. Behavioral measures were not <b>as</b> sensitive <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> <b>as</b> was the cortisol response.

40|$|The Minor in the Civil Procedure JUDr. Jana Sladká Hyklová Abstract The thesis {{deals with}} {{the topic of the}} minor in civil procedure. This topic has not been yet {{properly}} compiled in Czech legal literature although the issues of participation of minors within civil proceedings are still actual and their importance is increasing. The basic legal source covering the chosen topic is Act No. 99 / 1963 Coll., Civil Procedure Code, which had to be amended more than 120 times. Procedural law in family law matters, which form substantial part of the content of this thesis topic, is firmly connected with substantive law. Substantive legislation is nowadays represented by Civil Code and Family Law, which are supposed to be replaced on 1 January 2014 with new code of civil law, Civil Code (Act No. 89 / 2012 Coll.). This is the reason why the thesis pays attention to the existing legislation <b>as</b> well <b>as</b> <b>to</b> <b>novelties</b> brought by the new code. Where needed, an analysis of new legislation in terms of proper procedural protection of the rights of minors is provided. New legislation of civil law brings the question of preparation of appropriate procedural code. On spring 2012 the draft of law of non contentious procedure which includes main principles and outline of this brand new procedural regulation was published. Where [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{investigations}} {{reported here}} {{address the issue}} of overcoming loss in a typical isotropic metamaterial. The possibility of adding functionality to such materials, through gyrotropic effects, and diffraction management of nonlinear beams, driven by negative phase accumulation, is presented. Loss is overcome by the introduction of gain to the metamaterial. This is achieved on the basis that typical split-ring metaparticles can be suitably enhanced through the addition of carefully selected diodes. The detailed analysis given here deploys a familiar equivalent circuit model and specific current-voltage characteristics. It is emphasised that conditions must be in place to ensure overall stable material behaviour. The methodology uses convective and absolute instability concepts and it is shown that the latter can be so <b>detrimental</b> <b>as</b> <b>to</b> lead to a much reduced frequency window of operation. Another set of investigations emphasises that surface waves provide a path to new science. Consequently the propagation of surface waves along the interface between a metamaterial and a gyrotropic medium is promising for applications. The investigation outcomes of this complicated system need to demonstrate generation properties in real time. Hence, some unique finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) computations have been developed enabling their interesting connection to the Goos- Hanchen shift to be elegantly displayed. Many interesting forms of surface waves are discussed including the simultaneous generation of TE and TM waves propagating in opposite directions. It is well known that in an isotropic metamaterial backward waves can exist so this property is exploited to create a fascinating form of diffraction management. This is investigated both for the bulk and for cavities and the impact of what is defined as nonlinear diffraction is introduced. Finally, some magnetooptics is introduced that adds even more functionality to the generation of cavity solitons. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Background: The long-standing {{observation}} that the novelty-seeking personality trait is a predictor of drug use and other reinforcable risky behaviors raises the question <b>as</b> <b>to</b> how <b>novelty</b> and reward processing functionally interact in mesolimbic dopaminergic circuitry and how this interaction is modulated by the novelty-seeking personality trait. Methods: Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) hemodynamic responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and reward (monetary incentive) from the substantia nigra/ventral tegmental area (SN/VTA),the nucleus accumbens (NAcc), and the hippocampus of 29 subjects were correlated with novelty-seeking scores. These correlations were compared with those obtained for scores of reward-dependence. The fMRI data were taken from two experiments in which the interaction of novelty and reward was manipulated as a within-subject variable, and long-term memory for the critical stimuli was assessed after 24 hours. Results: Novelty-seeking {{was positively correlated with}} SN/VTA activation elicited by novel cues that did not predict reward, whereas reward-dependence was related to activations elicited by novel cues that predicted reward. The positive correlation between SN/VTA responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and novelty-seeking scores was accompanied by a negative correlation with reward-related SN/VTA activation and memory enhancement. Conclusions: SN/VTA responses <b>to</b> <b>novelty</b> and reward are differentially affected by personality traits of novelty-seeking and reward-dependence. Importantly, novelty-seekers were more responsive to novel cues in the absence of reward and needed less reward to boost their memory for novel cues. These observations strongly suggest that for novelty-seekers, the motivational value of novelty is not necessarily based on actual reward-predicting stimulus properties...|$|R
