50|$|Vegetation-induced {{sedimentary}} structures (VISS) are primary sedimentary structures {{formed by}} the interaction of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> with in situ plants. VISS provide physical evidence of vegetation's fundamental role in mediating sediment accumulation and erosion in clastic depositional environments. VISS can be broken into seven types, five being hydrodynamic and two being decay-related. The simple hydrodynamic VISS are categorized by centroclinal cross strata, scratch semicircles and upturned beds. The complex hydrodynamic VISS are categorized by coalesced scour fills and scour-and-mound beds. The decay-related VISS are categorized by mudstone-filled hollows and downturned beds.|$|E
50|$|In the Yorkshire dales the Carboniferous rocks assume {{an aspect}} very {{different}} from that which obtains in the South. Beds of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment,</b> sandstones, shales and occasional ironstones and thin coals separate the limestones into well-defined beds. These limestone beds have received various names of local significance (Hardraw Scar, Simonstone, Middle, Underset, Main and many others), and owing to the country being little disturbed by faulting and being much cut up by the streams, they stand out as escarpments {{on either side of the}} valleys. The first indication of the intercalation of thick detrital deposits within the massive limestone is seen in Ingleborough and Penyghent; but as the rocks are traced north the detrital matter increases in quantity and the limestones diminish, until in Northumberland the whole Carboniferous series assumes the Yoredale phase, and consists of alternations of detrital and calcareous beds, no massive limestone being seen.|$|E

We trace the layer through sediment cores collected along the Labrador and Greenland margins of the Labrador Sea. Biomarker data, Ca/Sr ratios and d 18 O measurements link the carbonate contained in the red layer to the Palaeozoic bedrock of the Hudson Bay. We conclude that the debris was carried to the Labrador Sea during a glacial outburst flood through the Hudson Strait, analogous to the final Lake Agassiz outburst flood about 8, 400 years ago, probably {{around the time of}} a last interglacial cold event in the North Atlantic.

Biodegradation of p-CP in estuarine water samples in shake flasks was slow over incubation periods of 300 h. The addition of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> resulted in immediate and rapid degradation evidenced by the production of 14 CO 2 from [14 C]p-CP.

Bacteria in the water and associated with the sediment after preexposure of both water and sediment of p-CP demonstrated enhanced biodegradation.

40|$|Thin {{carbonate}} laminae {{formed by}} root activity are common within Miocene detrital deposits of the Duero and Madrid basins. The laminae are about 3 cm thick, extending several metres laterally, and displace the original <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment,</b> which ranges in grain size from fine gravel to sandy clay. The thickness, morphology, microstructure and stable isotope compositions of the laminae {{indicate that they}} formed by the activities of roots and associated microorganisms within the soil. The laminae {{are similar to those}} commonly recognised in thick laminar calcrete profiles. Three types of laminae are recognised. Differences in the micromorphology of the laminae are explained as reflecting the different organisms involved and whether calcification occurred when the root was alive or decaying. The first type occurs in a profile at Paracuellos the Jarama, where the laminae consist of a mosaic of 20 mm calcite crystals whose arrangement indicates that calcification took place in the medulla of the root and probably occurred while the plant was alive. In a second type in the Villacadima profile, laminae comprise calcified root mats whose formation indicates the interplay of roots and fungi. Calcification of the cell-walls and intracellular spaces took place in the cortices of the roots and not in the medullas as revealed by the presence of central pores in every calcified root. A third type of lamina is recognised in profiles at Vin˜egra de Moran˜a and consists of mucilaginous sheets coated by needle-fibre calcite crystals. The occurrence of associated small root casts indicates that formation of the laminae occurred while the root was decaying and was also influenced by fungal activity. These laminae occur within poorly developed soils and their formation was controlled by the relationship between sedimentation, erosion and soil formation processes. Thus, the occurrence of these laminae interbedded with detrital sediments reflects environments where sedimentation was relatively low and episodic, so after the <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> input surfaces were stable and root mats were able to develop. Renewed sedimentation accounted for the death of the root mats and the development of new ones on the new surfaces. Where the sedimentation rate is lower the laminae tend to amalgamate and thicker laminar calcrete profiles form with little or no interbedded <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the application of}} a hydrogeomorphological numerical model (CAESAR) to simulate, at hourly time steps, changes in the hydrological and sediment regime of the Petit lac d’Annecy catchment. The outputs of the model were validated in three ways. In the short term (~ 5 years), water discharge outputs were compared against observed instrumental data. Over the longer term, modelled sediment discharge (AD 1825 – 2005) was compared with proxies for <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> influx (environmental magnetism) and accumulation rates discerned from a 210 Pb chronology for the lake sediments. Finally, spatial validation of the modelled erosion and deposition of sediment was undertaken by comparison with a field and remotely sensed survey of catchment geomorphology. The results suggest that while minor perturbations in forest cover during the last 180 years have partially conditioned the response of the sediment system, the bulk of modelled sediment discharge and particularly the peaks in sediment discharge were controlled by flood duration and magnitude, which in turn is driven by precipitation (storms/floods) and snowmelt. Basin geometry and geomorphology of each sub-catchment (Ire and Tamie) were also important in producing differences in the modelledsediment discharge. In essence, these differences were a function of sediment accommodation space and the ability of each system to store and release sediments. Modelled sediment discharge and ?para (lake sediments) display similar histories, and thus are both interpreted as reflecting variations in <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> supply. Intriguingly the style of modelled sediment discharge from the Ire, a confined mountain torrent, displays a greater similarity to and perhaps dominates the lake sediment record. These results provide partial validation of the CAESAR model and indicate that perhaps in the future it may be used as an exploratory and predictive tool in determining the impact of changes in climate, meteorology and land use on lake-catchment systems...|$|E

Interpretations of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> analyses are {{often based on}} the rarely tested assumption of time-invariant tracer concentration. A better understanding of when and where this assumption breaks down and what sampling strategies minimize temporal and small-scale spatial variance will improve science done using detrital river sediment. Here, we present new and previously published spatial and temporal replicates measured for in situ and meteoric 10 Be (10 Be i and 10 Be m, respectively). Our new data include 113 replicate pairs, taken from agricultural and/or tectonically active watersheds in China months to millennia apart and spatial replicates taken up to 2 km apart on the same day. The mean percentage difference is 10 % (- 122 % to 150 %) for both systems considered together; the mode is close to 0 % for both systems; and 36 % of pairs of samples replicate within our analytical accuracy at 2 σ. We find that 10 Be i replicates better than 10 Be m (p < 0. 01). 10 Be i replicability is worse in steeper basins, suggesting that stochastic processes (i. e. landslides) affect reproducibility. 10 Be m replicability is worse in larger basins, suggesting non-conservative behavior of 10 Be m as sediment moves downstream. Our {{results are consistent with}} the few previously published replicate studies. Considering all replicate data {{in a wide range of}} landscapes, in areas with deep erosional processes, replicability is poor; in other areas, replicability is good. This suggests that, in steep, tectonically active, and/or agricultural landscapes, individual <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> measurements do not represent upstream rates as well as larger populations of samples.

40|$|Grain-size {{dependencies}} in fallout radionuclide activity {{have been}} attributed to either increase in specific surface area in finer grain sizes or differing mineralogical abundances in different grain sizes. Here, we consider a third possibility, that the concentration and composition of grain coatings, where fallout radionuclides reside, controls their activity in fluvial sediment. We evaluated these three possible explanations in two experiments: (1) we examined the effect of sediment grain size, mineralogy, and composition of the acid-extractable materials on the distribution of 7 Be, 10 Be, 137 Cs, and unsupported 210 Pb in <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> samples collected from rivers in China and the United States, and (2) we periodically monitored 7 Be, 137 Cs, and 210 Pb retention in samples of known composition exposed to natural fallout in Ohio, USA for 294 days. Acid-extractable materials (made up predominately of Fe, Mn, Al, and Ca from secondary minerals and grain coatings produced during pedogenesis) are positively related to the abundance of fallout radionuclides in our sediment samples. Grain-size dependency of fallout radionuclide concentrations was significant in <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> samples, but not in samples exposed to fallout under controlled conditions. Mineralogy had a large effect on 7 Be and 210 Pb retention in samples exposed to fallout, suggesting that sieving sediments to a single grain size or using specific surface area-based correction terms may not completely control for preferential distribution of these nuclides. We conclude that time-dependent geochemical, pedogenic, and sedimentary processes together result in the observed differences in nuclide distribution between different grain sizes and substrate compositions. These findings likely explain variability of measured nuclide activities in river networks that exceeds the variability introduced by analytical techniques as well as spatial and temporal differences in erosion rates and processes. In short, we suggest that presence and amount of pedogenic grain coatings is more important than either specific surface area or surface charge in setting the distribution of fallout radionuclides...|$|E

These new records show that the different grain-size distributions {{can be associated with}} 1) Asian dust from the western and central Chinese deserts and Chinese loess and 2) volcanogenic materials that were derived from the Luzon Islands.

The MARs of Asian dust and volcanic materials are coupled with the glacial-interglacial cycle; these values are found to have been higher and more variable during the glacial period than during the interglacial period. We argue that the strengthening aridity of the Asian continent, which is connected to solar insolation and ice volume variations from orbital eccentricity, constitutes an important mechanism that drives the high MARs of glacial dust in the western Philippine Sea. The internal positive feedback of dust may be another important mechanism. The significant increase in volcanic material during the glacial period was caused by sea level changes, which were driven by the ice volume and solar insolation at high latitudes, and by strengthened precipitation from the El Nino/Southern Oscillation (ENSO), which is driven by orbital eccentricity and precession cycles on the Luzon Islands...|$|R
40|$|The {{content of}} the cosmogenic isotope 10 Be (t 1 / 2 = 1. 39 Mat 1 / 2 = 1. 39 Ma) in {{lacustrine}} sediments that deposit in lakes with a large watershed is susceptible to both climate and cosmogenic production rate variations. In order to distinguish between these two controls, we measured 10 Be and major elements in several sections of the annually laminated sediments of the Lake Lisan (the last Glacial precursor of the Dead Sea) that are composed of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments</b> and primary (evaporitic) aragonites. The sections were selected to represent regional hydrology and climate as reflected by different lake configurations (level rise, drop and high-stands) and rapid change in the 10 Be production rate during the Laschamp geomagnetic excursion. Since the short-lived cosmogenic “sister” of 10 Be, 7 Be (t 1 / 2 = 53. 3 dt 1 / 2 = 53. 3 d) has virtually no recycled component, the recycled 10 Be in Lake Lisan <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments</b> was evaluated by measuring 7 Be in their modern equivalents: modern flood suspended matter, dust and mud cracks. Our results demonstrate that although the recycled 10 Be component is significant, secular variations in the 10 Be concentration in Lake Lisan sediments correlate with hydrological variations and geomagnetic excursions. During periods of moderate variations in 10 Be production rate, the 10 Be concentration in the Lisan <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments</b> positively correlates with lake level, Al + Fe content and the (Al + Fe) /(Ca + Mg) ratio. These correlations suggest that the 10 Be is adsorbed on the fine silicate component (probably clays) of the detrital laminae. The fine silicates together with carbonates were transported to Dead Sea drainage basin mainly as airborne dust that after a short residence time was washed into Lake Lisan as flood suspended matter. We suggest that preferential dissolution of carbonates in the flood suspended matter concentrated the residual fine component leading to the positive correlation between 10 Be and the (Al + Fe) /(Ca + Mg) ratio. During periods of increased water discharge more carbonates were dissolved and hence the 10 Be concentration in the detrital laminae increased. During periods of rapid increase in the 10 Be production rate (e. g. the Laschamp excursion), 10 Be showed a ∼ 2 fold increase, beyond the above-mentioned correlations (lake levels and Al + Fe contents). This observation suggests that Lake Lisan {{can serve as a}} potential high-resolution archive of 10 Be production rate variations during periods of geomagnetic excursions. © 2014 Elsevier B.

The profile consists of a lower horizon of removilised weathered basalts, an intermediate red sandy mudstones horizon with irregular carbonate layers and a topmost horizon of amalgamated carbonate layers with root traces. Formation occurred in arid to semiarid climates, giving place to a complex mineralogical association, including Mg-carbonates and chabazite, rarely described in cal/dolocretes profiles. Initial vadose weathering processes occurred in the basalts and in directly overlying <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments,</b> producing (Stage 1) red-smectites and dolomicrite. Dominant phreatic (Stage 2) conditions allowed precipitation of coarse-zoned dolomite and chabazite filling porosities. In Stages 3 and 4, mostly pedogenic, biogenic processes {{played an important role}} in dolomite and calcite accumulation in the profile. Overall evolution of the profile and its mineralogical association involved initial processes dominated by alteration of host rock, to provide silica and Mg-rich alkaline waters, suitable for chabazite and dolomite formation, without a previous carbonate phase. Dolomite formed both abiogenically and biogenically, but without a previous carbonate precursor and in the absence of evaporites. Dominance of calcite towards the profile top is the result of Mg/Ca decrease in the interstitial meteoric waters due to decreased supply of Mg from weathering, and increased supply of Ca in aeolian dust. Meteoric origin of the water is confirmed by C and O isotope values, which also indicate lack of deep sourced CO 2.

At this time inorganic nutrient concentrations are high in lagoon water, but low temperature and low light conditions limit growth of benthic algae. However, diatom blooms retain nutrients and they are recycled to <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> to become available to benthic algae and Nodularia when temperatue and light are favorable for their growth in summer...|$|E
40|$|Géomorphologie mapping and {{structural}} data provide the preliminary {{results of the}} géomorphologie features of the Pindal Cave and surrounding area, described in this work. The landscape results from fluvial, mass wasting, karstic and marine processes, with the outstanding presence of two erosion marine surfaces called "Rasas": Pimiango (125 - 170 m) and Pindal (50 - 64 m). The origin of the Cave, developed in the karstic massif reaching its highest level in Pindal Rasa, is mainly controlled by two fractures trending E-W. The géomorphologie evolution of the Cave is due to 7 / block collapse from the roof related to three joint systems; 21 the episodic infilling by <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> coming from denudation of Pimiango Rasa Range and 3 / the chemical precipitation of speleotheme overlying both alluvial and collapse deposits. The present dynamics of the Cave is controlled by vadose conditions and collapse processes and sporadic flooding of channel inside the cave. A lower active level is inferred from scarps development in deposits over the floor cav...|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} the stratigraphy of sediment cores that span the last 13, 000 yrs from three {{sites in the}} main basin of Lake Titicaca, Boliva/Peru as indicators of regional paleoclimate. The cores show similar patterns of change after ~ 6, 400 calendar yrs before present (cal yr BP) but differ before that time. Site NE 98 -PC 2, which is near the Rio Illave and its delta, shows differences in diatom species composition and in calcium carbonate concentrations relative to cores from the other two sites, particularly during times of inferred high precipitation. In contrast, the carbon isotopic stratigraphy of the three sites is relatively similar. The magnetic susceptibility {{data suggest that the}} proximity of site NE 98 -PC 2 to the river and delta resulted in higher loads of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediment</b> prior to 6, 400 yr BP, whereas pelagic sources contributed most of the sediment at the other sites. These differences highlight the potential for spatial heterogeneity of sediment records in large lake systems and the importance of evaluating multiple cores for robust interpretation of paleoenvironmental history...|$|E
40|$|Zircon is {{a common}} {{accessory}} mineral in most rocks and sediments, and although it is ubiquitous, it possesses a considerable petrologic interest. In the scope of CHYNA project, some samples of <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments</b> have been collected in rivers and beaches from Western Algarve region. The present work {{presents the results of}} the analyses undergone with the intent to document the existing zircons’ variability in these samples. The zircons from 22 samples have been analysed based on their shape, colour and inclusions. There is predominance of rounded and subrounded grains, generally colourless and without inclusions. Systematic differences between beaches and rivers are not observed, indicating that both environments have the same zircon sources. CHYNA project (POCTI/CTA/ 48375 / 2002), financed by the Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia (FCT), with FEDER and OE supports...|$|R
40|$|The aquifer {{modelled}} in {{this study}} is approximately 3 km long and 450 - 600 m wide and is hosted in Quaternary alluvial and <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments</b> that crop out to the north of Ventimiglia (Liguria, Italy), covering about 2 km 2 at the confluence of the Roia river and the Bevera torrent. The aquifer is of strategic regional and crossborder importance, providing drinking water to part of Liguria and the French coast. Starting from a conceptual model of the aquifer, numerical transient regime flow and solute transport models were developed. The two watercourses, and especially the Roia, were found to {{play a key role in}} this aquifer system. Analysis of the overall water budget and those of the various sectors showed that exchange of water between the watercourses and the aquifer compensated the volumes pumped from the wells...|$|R
40|$|The Purcăreţ - Boiu Mare Plateau and the {{southern}} edge of the Baia Mare Depression, in Sălaj and Maramureş Counties, NW Romania, host over 200 caves located in limestones ranging in age from Upper Eocene to Badenian. The carbonate rocks are interposed with non-karst rocks consisting of shales, sandstones and marls. Four caves hosted by limestones of different lithologies have been investigated for secondary minerals in the composition of their speleothems. Calcite, gypsum, goethite, jarosite, brushite, hydroxylapatite and taranakite were found in the composition of crusts, crystals, aggregates and earthy masses. The mineral association was characterized by means of X-ray diffraction and scanning electron microscopy. Gypsum, goethite and jarosite resulted from sulphide oxidation, whereas the phosphate associations formed through the interaction of phosphoric acid from bat guano with the limestones and <b>detrital</b> <b>sediments.</b> In Lii Cave, hydroxylapatite was also identified in black crusts deposited on fossil rib fragments within the limestones. ...|$|R
