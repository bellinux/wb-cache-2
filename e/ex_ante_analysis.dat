5000|$|The {{theory of}} lead markets {{has been criticized}} for not being [...] "consistent and stringent". While {{conventional}} wisdom, due to its emphasis on customer affluence and sophistication as inducers of innovation, has tended to see lead markets exist in economically highly developed countries; recent research, notably by Rajnish Tiwari and Cornelius Herstatt of Hamburg University of Technology (e.g. Tiwari and Herstatt, 2011a, Tiwari and Herstatt, 2011b), has emphasized the need to update/extend the lead market model to adjust it to the changing ground realities in the face of globalization and sustained economic growth in developing nations. Using examples of several frugal innovations from India, and more specifically the case of small car industry in India's automotive sector, Rajnish Tiwari in his dissertation at Hamburg University of Technology (TUHH) has proposed that lead markets can emerge in developing nations as well provided the market size enables significant economies of scale and the country's innovation system is endowed with the necessary technological capabilities. These two conditions, seen in conjunction with several other factors such as embeddedness in the international trade and access to open global innovation networks (OGINs), can in many instances compensate other typical drawbacks of developing countries, such as low purchasing power. As a consequence, Tiwari's dissertation has proposed to update the model to include technology advantage in the model, while combining the export and transfer advantages as one single group. Factors within the individual groups of advantages have been also update/modified. The evolution of India's small car sector has also provided some valuable insights into possible emergence of a lead market in a country. This model, if validated by further research, would help enable an <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> <b>analysis</b> of lead markets, whereas so far mostly ex post, macroeconomic analyses have been the norm.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we explore}} how <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> scale {{dynamics}} <b>analysis</b> {{can contribute to}} better understanding of interactions between scales and levels, and how these interactions influence solution space in policy processes. In so doing, we address opportunities and challenges of conducting <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> scale dynamics <b>analysis</b> {{as part of an}} action-oriented social science research approach that seeks to enhance its contribution to more scale-sensitive policy development. The policy debate on sustainable biofuels in Mozambique provides the empirical context in which we analyze interactions across administrative, institutional, and economic scales and levels, and how these interactions influence the space in which policy solutions can be explored and designed. On the basis of the analysis, we conclude that <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> scale dynamics <b>analysis</b> can contribute to: (1) increasing awareness of interactions between scales and levels, and their implications for policy, (2) identifying immediate and potential matches and mismatches between scales and levels, and developing (adaptive) capacity to address them, and (3) identifying stakeholders and their scale- and level-related interests that can provide the basis for collaborative multi-stakeholder learning. Consequently, <b>ex</b> <b>ante</b> scale dynamics <b>analysis</b> can provide an important contribution to balancing and harmonizing interactions across different scales and levels, from which innovative and scale-sensitive policy responses can emerge.

40|$|Using {{data from}} 1995 and 1996, {{the authors of}} this paper {{estimate}} the cost of the Arizona Enhanced I/M Program and the emission reductions achieved. They begin by enumerating briefly the components of I/M costs and discuss their size and incidence.

Inspection costs include the costs of operating the test stations and the costs motorists incur in time and money to get to the station and go through the testing process. The authors find that the inspection costs account for over two-thirds of the full costs of I/M, while costs associated with actual vehicle repair account for only one third.

40|$|This {{document}} {{provides a}} review of recent theoretical and empirical literature {{on the relationship between}} entry, exit and productivity. Decomposition methods show that entry and exit considerably contribute to productivity growth, but are unable to shed any light on the ultimate sources of productivity growth. However, the theories discussed do provide options for effective policy instruments. We argue that productivity or welfare should be the aim of policy and not the number of entrants, the intensity of competition or the amount of innovation expenditures. Taking a welfare approach, we address market failures with respect to entry. The most eminent market failure is market power of dominant incumbents. Lowering institutional entry barriers economy-wide is a promising policy option for further consideration. Whether such a policy measure actually improves social welfare depends also on the extent of other failures.
