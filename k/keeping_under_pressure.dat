40|$|One {{major problem}} related to {{construction}} on peaty clay deposit is the low shear {{strength of the}} soil. However previous researches {{have shown that the}} shear strength could increase significantly by mixing with cement and various stabilizers. Hence some improvement methods have been developed to increase the bearing capacity of the peaty clay deposit by mixing with stabilizers and cement. The aim of this project is to evaluate the increase of shear strength of peaty clays due to mixing with cement and the application of preloading pressure during the curing period. The initial undrained shear strength was obtained from untreated remoulded peaty clay subject to preloading pressures. For this study, samples were prepared for untreated peaty clay samples and treated peaty clay by mixing with 15 % and 20 % cement by wet weight and <b>keeping</b> <b>under</b> two preloading <b>pressures</b> of; 20 kN/m 2 and 40 kN/m 2. The shear strength of the samples was obtained by triaxial compression test under unconsolidated undrained condition. The results proved that there is an increase in the range of 150 % to 240 % in shear strength due to mixing with cement and application of preloading pressure during the curing process. The other major problem related to construction on peaty clay deposit is the high settlement of the soil. The previous researches have proven that the settlement of soft soil has decreases significantly with the addition of stabilizers and cement. For the analysis of compressibility characteristics, peaty clay samples were mixed with 0 %, 15 % and 20 % cement by wet weight and <b>keeping</b> <b>under</b> two preloading <b>pressures</b> of; 20 kN/m 2 and 40 kN/m 2. Consolidation characteristics of the untreated and treated peaty clay are determined through the series of laboratory consolidation testing. From the consolidation test results, coefficient of volume compressibility (mv) and the coefficient of secondary consolidation (Ca) were evaluated in all the loading and reloading increments. The values of compression index (Cc) and recompression index (Cr) were also evaluated using the e Vs log a plot. The improvement of the stiffness is assessed and compared by the measurement of compressibility characteristics of the treated peaty clay with untreated peaty clay...|$|R

25|$|In 2005, as {{the inaugural}} effort, the theme was simply ‘Awareness of high blood pressure’. The 2006 theme was ‘Treat to goal’, {{with a focus}} on <b>keeping</b> blood <b>pressure</b> <b>under</b> control. The {{recommended}} blood pressures are less than 140/90 mmHg for the general population and for the hypertensive population without any other complications, and less than 130/80 mmHg for those with diabetes mellitus or chronic kidney disease. These are the cut-off values recommended by international and Canadian guidelines. The 2007 WHD theme was ‘Healthy diet, healthy blood pressure’. Through such specific themes, the WHL intends to raise awareness not only of hypertension, but also of factors contributing to an increase in the incidence of hypertension and on ways to prevent it. In an effort to empower the public, the theme for 2008 was ‘Measure your blood pressure…at home’. Recent reports confirm the ease, accuracy and safety of blood pressure measurements using home monitors.|$|R

30|$|During {{anesthetic}} procedures IOP {{control is}} important. Especially during ocular surgery, an important aim of anesthetic management is <b>keeping</b> intraocular <b>pressure</b> <b>under</b> control. During and after ocular surgery sudden and large changes in intraocular pressure may cause {{damage to the}} postoperative vision functions of these patients (Schäfer et al. 2002). Increased IOP disrupts vascular regulation, and additionally applies mechanical pressure to veins supplying the optical nerve and retina, reducing ocular perfusion pressure. All medications used for anaesthesia may change IOP. Also, insertion of endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway increases IOP (Alipour et al. 2014). An animal study showing the effect of general anaesthesia on IOP showed that isoflurane lowered IOP and that this effect became more distinct as the duration of anaesthesia lengthened. This study used 20 -min duration of anaesthesia and observed that the greatest reduction in IOP was in the 20 th minute (Jia et al. 2000). In our study similarly, in the 20 th minute the reduction of IOP {{in the control group}} was greatest and graphically we observed the difference with the OLE group narrowed at the 20 th minute. We believe this situation may have developed linked to the effect of isoflurane increasing with the duration of anaesthesia.|$|R
40|$|Background: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{demonstrate}} the hypotensive efficacy and tolerability of latanoprost when used as monotherapy and as polytherapy associated with antiglaucomatous medication proven to be ineffective in <b>keeping</b> intraocular <b>pressure</b> <b>under</b> control. Methods: Three hundred and thirty-seven patients (672 eyes) affected by primary open-angle glaucoma and intraocular hypertension were recruited over a period of 10 years from the Glaucoma Centre, Department of Ophthalmological Sciences, University of Rome "Sapienza", and treated, subject to informed consent, with latanoprost 0. 005 % alone or in combination with other ocular hypotensive drugs. The patients were followed during this period at regular intervals, with determination of visual field, fundus oculi, visual acuity, and eventual onset of local and systemic side effects. Results: Latanoprost used as monotherapy and as polytherapy renders possible optimal and durable control of intraocular pressure in the form of one antiglaucomatous drug because it can substitute for one or more drugs and obtain the same hypotensive effect. Conclusion: Latanoprost can be described as the ideal hypotensive drug, not only because of its ideal compliance profile (only one daily dose in the evening), excellent hypotensive effect, and, above all, few systemic side effects. © 2012 Pacella et al, publisher and licensee Dove Medical Press Ltd...|$|R

The experimental group practiced handgun shooting <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> evoked by an opponent who fired back using marking (coloured soap) cartridges. The control group practiced shooting on standard cardboard targets. While {{at the outset}} both groups performed worse {{in front of an}} opponent firing back compared to cardboard targets, after training, shooting performance of the experimental group no longer deteriorated while performance of the control group was still equally harmed. These results indicate that training <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> can acclimatize shooting performance of police officers to those highpressure situations they may encounter during their work. Yet, this study does not provide insights into more detailed changes in behaviour that accompany or underlie changes in performance. Therefore, in a next (pilot) study we explored changes in shooting accuracy, movement times, head/body orientation, blink and gaze behavior of police officers shooting <b>under</b> <b>pressure.</b> Results again showed that with pressure, shooting accuracy decreased. Furthermore, participants acted faster, had a different head/body orientation, made more blinks, and seemed to have higher search rates and decreased durations of fixations on the targets. The pilot study is currently followed-up by a training study investigating the effects of training <b>under</b> <b>pressure</b> on the same variables.
