40|$|The groundmass of andesitic dykes at Sezaki, {{southwest}} Japan, has trachytic {{texture and}} contains microscopic shear zones. The shear zones comprise a conjugate pair formed by flattening of the solidifying <b>dyke</b> <b>rock,</b> probably {{caused by the}} magma pressure of the still molten part of the dyke. This pressure shortened the solidifying rock perpendicular to the dyke margins and caused it to extrude parallel to the magma flow direction. The groundmass shears indicate that locally the magma flowed 60 ° upward in the dykes. It is concluded that while groundmass shears are a useful indicator of flow direction in dykes, phenocryst alignment in dykes is strongly influenced by magma-pressure flattening and thus may be a poor indicator of flow direction...|$|E

The pneumatolithic environment of the Karikari dumor-tierite seems imilar to that described for an Iranian occurrence by Sabzehei 0971). Dumortierite is a very minor component (less than o-I modal %) of the rock in which it occurs but is immediately noticeable in thin-section because of its unusual red and blue pleochroic olours; it occurs as small (< o.

Its rarity, small size, and intimate association with epidote and tourmaline made it impossible to separate sufficient material for X-ray identification.

40|$|Triassic {{magmatic rocks}} in the Central Dinarides in Bosnia and Herzegovina are known from two {{separate}} geotectonic units: (1) the Adriatic Carbonate Platform (Outer Dinarides) and (2) the Palaeozoic–Triassic allochthonous complex. They are assigned to the same regional, genetic and geochemical unit. Their emplacement age is inferred from contacts with the surrounding marble and sedimentary rocks (post-Anisian for intrusives and Ladinian for effusives). The magmatic rocks display different levels of emplacement and crystallization (intrusive, effusive and dyke rocks). They represent different stages of magmatic differentiation, from gabbro/basalt via diorite/andesite to granodiorite/dacite and granites. The most frequent <b>dyke</b> <b>rock</b> is diabase. Pillow basalts indicate eruption under subaquatic conditions. Pyroclastic rocks within the volcano–sedimentary unit point to the temporary explosive character of orogenic magmatic activity. Most rocks are affected and modified by post-magmatic alteration and hydrothermal fluids. This {{led to the formation}} of spilite, keratophyre, quartz keratophyre and rarely K spilite. New geochemical data support the opinion that subduction was the main process which triggered the Triassic magmatic activity in the Central Dinarides.

40|$|The {{rare earth}} element (REE) {{distribution}} in a comagmatic, metaluminous, igneous suite, consisting of a monzogranite, differentiating to an even-grained granite and eventually a sequence of <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks,</b> was investigated. During {{the early stages of}} the differentiation process, the REE behaved compatibly, the LREE being preferentially removed by fractionation of early allanite and monazite. With increasing fractionation, higher silica content and increasing alkalinity in the <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks,</b> evidence for the incompatible behaviour of the REE were obtained. LREE, Eu and, to a lesser extent, Gd were fractionated from the HREE and concentrated in the dyke centres. Partitioning of F and F-REE complexes towards the highly fractionated melt phase contributed towards this process. An increase in oxidation conditions during the very late evolutionary phases of the dykes again stabilized allanite as an accessory phase. LREE were sufficiently enriched at this stage to be incorporated in the mineral, leading to a subsequent lowering of the La Sm ratio in some highly evolved dyke centres. Late crystallizing fluorite in dyke centres accommodated some of the enriched LREE by a process of coupled substitution. Evidence for these fractionation processes in evolved metaluminous felsic rocks have implications for the use of REE in modelling the generation of such rocks. © 1995. Articl...|$|R
40|$|Mafic and silicic <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks,</b> which {{occur in}} the Ag-U ore {{district}} of Jachymov (Joachimsthal) in the Krusne hory (Erzgebirge) belong to kersantites, diorite porphyries, and granite porphyries, subordinately to spessartites. Dykes of minettes are located outside the district and penetrate the Nejdek-Eibenstock granitic massif. Mafic and silicic dykes exhibit diverse cross-cutting relationships and form in places composite dykes. Lamprophyres correspond to shoshonitic magmas with high abundances of compatible (Cr, Ni) and incompatible elements (Rb, Ba, P). All mafic dykes were affected by a postmagmatic alteration manifested by replacement of primary olivine and pyroxenes by amphibole, biotite and chlorite. Granite porphyries crystallized from leucocratic, weakly peraluminous, low-P magmas with moderate enrichments in Rb and depletions in Ca, Sr and Zr. By contrast, diorite porphyries are intermediate rocks containing 62 - 65 wt. % SiO 2 whose geological occurrence and major-element composition suggest origin by magma mixing involving lamprophyric and silicic melts, with simultaneous fractionation of biotite. The Th/U ratios in all <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> correspond to chondritic and crustal values and demonstrate that whole-rock uranium contents were neither significantly increased nor affected by contemporaneous mineralization events. The stable isotope composition has been determined for whole rocks (O, C, S) and carbonate minerals (C, O). Wholerock δ 18 O values range between 1. 6 to 7. 8 Ã¢Â€Â° SMOW and do not show any systematic variations with the rock types. The isotopic composition of carbonates {{is represented by the}} following values: δ 18 O = 19. 6 to 25. 0 Ã¢Â€Â° SMOW and δ 13 C = - 5. 7 to - 9. 0 Ã¢Â€Â° PDB. The high positive values of δ 18 O of carbonates are in a remarkable contrast to compositions of primary magmatic carbonates and indicate the carbonate formation during low-temperature hydrothermal event(s). Sulphides in kersantites and diorite porphyries yielded δ 34 S = 0. 5 to 6. 6 Ã¢Â€Â° CDT, which document crustal in addition to mantle source of sulphur consistent with average value in the Saxothuringian crust (~ 5 Ã¢Â€Â° CDT). Bulk magnetic susceptibility of <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> shows a general decrease from mafic to silicic magmas in a sequence as follows: kersantites - 500, minettes - 350, diorite porphyries - 350 and granite porphyries - 50 Ã¢ÂˆÂ™ 10 - 6 [SI]. Local increases up to 5000 Ã¢ÂˆÂ™ 10 - 6 [SI] are due to accessory pyrrhotite in kersantites and diorite porphyries. Mafic dykes in the Western Krusne hory (Erzgebirge) are preferentially found within the Jachymov-Gera tectonic zone and demonstrate spatial focusing of ascending mantle-derived melts. Such pathways may have served for transfer of ore-forming elements on the crustal scale by fluids of diverse origin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The Miocene {{igneous rocks}} in the Basal Unit of the Lavrion area form part of the granitoid {{province}} of the central Aegean. Undeformed, subvertical dykes of quartz-syenite to granodiorite and granite porphyries, and a little deformed but variably altered granodiorite stock intrude metamorphic rocks of the Basal Unit. A 9. 4 ± 0. 3 Ma K–Ar age on feldspar for a <b>dyke</b> <b>rock</b> provides a minimum age for the igneous activity in the Basal Unit. East–west orientation of porphyry dykes is indicative of a regional extensional stress field with roughly north–south direction. Substantial extension in the Basal Unit after granodiorite emplacement is evident from widespread quartz veining associated with hydrothermal alteration of the granodiorite and the occurrence of mineralized tension gashes cutting the hydrothermally altered hornfelses. Final emplacement of the Blueschist Unit over the Basal Unit by extensional detachment post-dates contact metamorphism of the rocks surrounding the granodiorite. Geochemical diagrams show a continuous range of compositions from the dykes to the granodiorite. Radiogenic isotope compositions are compatible with a common magmatic source for the two lithologies. Elemental variations, {{as well as the}} considerable geochemical similarity of the dyke rocks to the Hercynian paragneiss of the central Cyclades, indicate that crustal melts were significant components during the evolution of the igneous rocks with fractional crystallization as a...|$|E
40|$|During the Geological Expedition to the Shackleton Range, Antarctica (GEISHA) in 1987 / 88, {{samples were}} taken from twenty-one basaltic dykes for palaeomagnetic investigations. The {{directions}} of characteristic remanent magnetization (ChRM) of the dykes were determined by thermal and alternating-field demagnetization of 268 cores drilled from the specimens collected. Moreover, {{on account of the}} hydrothermal and sometimes low-grade metamorphism of the <b>dyke</b> <b>rock</b> and the resulting partial modification of the primary magnetization, not only were comprehensive magnetic studies carried out, but also ore-microscopic examination. Only thus was it possible to achieve a reasonable assessment and interpretation of the remanent magnetization. Jurassic and Silurian-Devonian ages were confirmed for the dykes of the northern and northwestern Shackleton Range by comparison of the paleopole positions calculated {{on the basis of the}} ChRM of the dykes with the known pole positions for the eastern Antarctic, as well as with polar-wandering curves for Gondwana. Radiometric ages were also determined far some of the dykes. Middle and Late Proterozoic ages are postulated far the dykes in the Read Mountains. Conclusions on the geotectonic relations of the Shackleton Range can also be drawn from the palaeomagnetic data. It has been postulated that the main strike direction, which differs distinctly from that of the Ross orogen, is due to rotation or displacement of the Shackleton Range crustal block; however, this was not corroborated. The pole positions for the Shackleton Range agree with those of rocks of the same age from other areas of East Antarctica and its positions in the Palaeozoic-Mesozoic polar-wandering path for Gondwana are evidence against the idea of rotation and rather suggest that the position of the Shakleton Range crustal block is autochthonous...|$|E

Polzenites and associated melilitic rocks are characterized by the mineral association of olivine + melilite ± nephe- line, haüyne, monticellite, phlogopite, calcite, perovskite, spinels and apatite. New data on their mineral and chemical compositions from original Scheumann’s localities (the Vesec, Modlibohov, Luhov types) argue against {{the abolition of the}} group of ultramafic lamprophyres and the terms ‘polzenite’ and ‘alnöite’ by the Le Maitre (2002) classification. Marginal facies and numerous flat apophyses of the lopolith-like body known as the Osečná Complex show an olivine micro-melilitolite composition (lamprophyric facies). The porphyritic texture, chemical composition and the presence of characteristic minerals such as monticellite and phlogopite point to their affinity with ultramafic lamprophyres – polze- nites of the Vesec type. Melilite-bearing olivine nephelinites to olivine melilitites (olivine + clinopyroxene + nepheline + melilite ± haüyne and spinels with apatite) form a swarm of subparallel dykes known as the Devil’s Walls.

Of these, picrite, monchiquite, nephelinite and phonolite have been studied here. Whole rock and mineral geochemical data indicate that monchiquites evolved from a picritic primary magma by olivineþ magnetite fractionation and subsequent steps involving magma mixing at crustal levels. None of these processes or assimilation=magma mixing of wall rocks or other plutonic rocks within the complex can entirely explain the geochemical and Nd-Sr-isotopiccharacteristics of the monchiquites (i. e. a covariant alignment between (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) 370 0. 70367, (143 Nd/ 144 Nd) 370 0. 51237 and (87 Sr/ 86 Sr) 370 0. 70400, (143 Nd/ 144 Nd) 370 0. 51225 representing the end points of the array). This signature points to isotopic heterogeneities of the mantle source of the dyke-producing magma. The four mantle components (i. e. depleted mantle, lower mantle plume component, EMI-like component and EMII-like component) must occur in different proportions on a small scale in order to explain the isotopic variations of the <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks.</b> The EMII-like component might be incorporated into the source area of the primary magma by carbonatitic fluids involving subducted crustal material.

Instead, we propose that both, carbonatite and picrite=monchiquite, originated by low-degree partial melting of peridotite.

40|$|Comprehensive {{investigations}} {{were conducted}} on halogen (F, Cl and Br) distributions in alkaline to peralkaline rocks and their constituting halogen-bearing minerals (e. g., apatite, biotite, amphibole, titanite, etc.). Olivine melilitites and olivine nephelinites from Upper Rhine graben contain small amounts of Cl and Br with respect to associated evolved rocks such as tephrites and phonolites. Significant differences are not found in their F contents. The low Cl and Br contents of olivine melilitites and olivine nephelinites are similar to estimates for the primitive mantle, whereas the F contents of these samples are much higher. This probably points to a relatively F-rich mantle beneath Central Europe. Similar to oceanic basaltic samples, the investigated alkaline rocks generally present fairly uniform Cl/Br ratios (370 ± 120), suggesting that magmatic processes have limited effects on the fractionation of Cl and Br. Apatites from silicate rocks of the Kaiserstuhl Alkaline Complex contain higher Cl, Br, S, Fe, Mn, Th, U and Si contents but lower Sr and Nb contents than apatites from associated carbonatites. Apatites from some transitional samples (a carbonate-bearing melilititic <b>dyke</b> <b>rock</b> and a diatreme breccias which contains both carbonatitic and silicate fragments) show systematic zonations and record the compositional variations between apatites from silicate rocks and apatites from carbonatites. This provides new constraints for the genetic relations between alkaline silicate rocks and associated carbonatites in Kaiserstuhl, and also suggests that Cl and Br contents of apatite are potentially ideal indicators for magma evolution. Apatite, biotite, amphibole and titanite {{from a series of}} alkaline rocks of Tamazeght complex show variable halogen concentrations. In general, the Cl contents of the minerals from gabbros and monzonites are higher than those from pyroxenites and syenitic rocks. Calculations of the partitioning coefficients for F and Cl between coexisting biotite and amphibole show relatively constant values of 1. 1 and 0. 3, respectively. However, the KD values of F and Cl for other coexisting mineral pairs are highly variable depending on the crystal chemistry of mineral, halogen contents and prevailing temperature of melt. The generally observed and preferred partitioning sequence for F is apatite ≫ biotite, amphibole, titanite, whereas for Cl it is apatite > amphibole > biotite...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the tectonic {{evolution of the}} Mersin ophiolite of the central Tauride of Turkey, using palaeomagnetic, structural and geochemical analyses. This ophiolite {{represents one of the}} best examples of Tethyan-type ophiolites formed by supra-subduction zone spreading within the northern Neotethyan Ocean basin during the Late Cretaceous. It exposes a 3. 0 km section of lower crustal, cumulate rocks, and tectonically separated exposures of the underlying mantle sequence and metamorphic sole, both of which are cut by basaltic dykes. Stepwise thermal and alternating field demagnetization of ultramafic and gabbroic cumulates from 18 sites mostly identified single components of remanent magnetization characterized by ENE-directed, moderately upwards inclined directions in geographic coordinates with high coercivities/high unblocking temperatures. The slight increase in scattering in remanence directions after tilt correction has been interpreted to be related to local variations in orientation of cumulates layering within the magma chamber. Rock magnetic investigations showed that magnetite is the main magnetic mineral in the majority of ultramafic, gabbro and <b>dyke</b> <b>rock</b> samples, and rock magnetic and demagnetization characteristics suggest that the samples carry thermoremanent magnetizations acquired during crustal accretion. Net tectonic rotation analyses show that all the units of the Mersin ophiolite, including lower crustal cumulates, dykes in the mantle sequence and dykes in the metamorphic sole have experienced large clockwise rotations around NE- trending, moderately plunging to sub-horizontal axes. Correcting anisotropy of magnetic susceptibility data for the effects of these rotations suggests that magmatic flow in the cumulates had an initial NNE-SSW orientation, which if assumed to relate to seafloor spreading suggests that the Mersin spreading axis was oriented WNW-ESE. This is consistent with regional palaeogeographic reconstructions. The net tectonic rotation data show that dykes in the metamorphic sole are rotated by c. 45 °, significantly less than the c. 115 ° rotations seen in the mantle sequence and in the cumulate sequences of the overlying thrust sheets. These results therefore document an initial stage of intra-oceanic clockwise rotation of the ophiolite that occurred after initial detachment but prior to emplacement of dykes cutting the metamorphic sole. Subsequent additional clockwise rotation (of all units) may be attributed to further intra-oceanic rotation (preferred interpretation) or to later emplacement of the ophiolite onto the Tauride continental margin. Finally, some new, preliminary data are presented from the Lizard ophiolite of Cornwall in Appendix A, forming the results of a training project undertaken while awaiting permission for fieldwork in Turkey.

40|$|A total field {{magnetic}} {{survey was conducted}} in Harwood valley in Northern Teesdale, and the neighbouring area, to investigate the igneous intrusions which could {{be the cause of}} a magnetic anomaly and metasomatism in the mineralization of the area. Niccolite and other nickel-bearing minerals had been found in magnetite-rich ore at three localities in Harwood valley by a team of the British Geological Survey. This mineral assemblage has only been sighted in a few other zones and the cause of mineralization was assumed to be metamorphism due to the emplacement of the Whin Sill and associated dykes during the late Carboniferous-early Permian age. Magnetic profiles recently acquired in the area confirm the existence of a dyke intruding the Teesdale fault along the Harwood valley. The average amplitude of the anomaly is 350 nT, reversed with respect to the present field. Further investigations to the south-east and north-west of the valley relate the intrusion with the known outcrops of the Cleveland dyke (Tertiary). An outcrop of an igneous intrusion that bears similar properties with samples of the Cleveland <b>dyke</b> <b>rock</b> was recently sighted by the author at lower Langdon Beck near the confluence of the Tees and Harwood rivers. Thin sections of this rock displayed an identical match in grain size and pigment composition with the Cleveland dyke samples from other known outcrops, confirming the dyke's presence along the Teesdale Fault. 2. 5 D modelling of the magnetic profiles was carried out and the results reflect the depth {{to the top of the}} dyke at Harwood to be about 30 m. Thickness of the body varies from 5 to 25 m but is 12 m at Harwood and about 14 m in Etters Gill. Further south of the valley at Langdon Beck is another geological formation; the Burtreeford Disturbance. This is a series of faulting and folding that was a result of compressional stress (Permian age) from a WSW direction. It also produced the E- facing monoclinal folds of the Dent Fault zone and the easterly directed Pennine thrusts of the Cross Fell Inlier before, during and after the emplacement of the Whin. The study here reflects the Disturbance as a magnetic high and its confluence with the Teesdale fault, the inferred Cleveland dyke and the Whin Sill offers a complex interpretation challenge. A GIS data base for the project area was created using Arc-GIS, GRAVMAG, SURFER,DIDGER and other Microsoft Office applications. General interpretation of the anomalies is conducted but conclusions raise several questions. The cause of the mineralization in Harwood Valley is still uncertain, though it could be due to the cooling Cleveland dyke (58 Ma) or the dyke could be forming a passage for the fluids of unknown age from the lower crust or mantle that cool and crystallize at shallower depths...|$|E

We present U–Pb mineral isotope {{data on the}} Finnishplutons. The concordia ages are in the 1. 79 − 1. 77 Ga range {{and there is little}} evidence for inheritance. Initial radiogenic isotope compositions (our common-Pb data combined with previously published whole-rock Nd and Hf data) imply a major, yet varying, Archeansource component. Elemental geochemical data on five Finnish intrusions (the Nattanen stock, the Tepasto and Pomovaara complexes, the Riestovaara and Vainospää batholiths), as well as associated <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> allow the Nattanen-type granites to be classified as oxidizedA-type granites. Their petrogenesis may be related to partial melting of the lower crust by mafic underplating (extensional setting) or as a result of thermal relaxation in thickened crustal setting...|$|R

According to the status of resource mining and theory research, this paper analyzed the geological conditions (i. e. stratum, tectonic evolution and magmatism), in order to supply the theory guidance for the prospecting in this district. The exposure strata consists of Devonian, Carboniferous, Permian, Triassic and Quaternary, but Devonian is the key stratum, which there is a close relation with Sn–polymetallic deposits. This area, which experienced three tectonic evolution stages, is situated in the south margin of the Yangtze platform. Because of the affect of the tectonic evolution, it was characterized the special geological conditions and mineralization environment. The main magmatism occurred in the medium and late period of Yanshan, including biotite granite, granite porphyry, quartz diorite and white granite, in the pattern of <b>dykes,</b> <b>rock</b> strain, rock bed commonly. In the whole, the prospecting is rather favorable, in the deep or around of the known deposits...|$|R

Dating of two NNW-SSE trending dykes by K-Ar method has yielded Middle Proterozoic ages (ca. 1660 Ma and ca. 1420 Ma respectively). Our initial geochemical results on these <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> (0. 65 - 0. 15 wt pct K 2 O, 0. 37 - 0. 38 wt pct P 2 O 5, 3. 30 - 1. 00 wt pct TiO 2, 11 - 1 p. p. m. Rb, 250 - 90 p. p. m. Sr, 230 - 40 p. p. m. Ba, 160 - 40 p. p. m. Zr, and 30 - 10 x chondrite rare earth elemental abundances) indicate a transitional character between abyssal and plateau tholeiites. Petrogenetic modelling suggests that the dyke compositions have been derived by different degrees of partial melting of a heterogenous source mantle. The mantle sources with accessory amphibole and/or garnet, variably enriched in LREE and LIL elements, are compatible with the observed geochemical data...|$|R

The study of spectral absorptions of rocks and minerals in the visible and near infrared (VNIR) and short wavelength infrared (SWIR) spectral bands of the Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) using the Spectral Angle Mapper (SAM) supervised image classification technique has provided information on the occurrence of minerals in the rock types of the regions. The study shows the occurrence of carbonate minerals in the limestone formations and of poorly altered silicate minerals in the basic <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> of the study regions. The analysis of minerals over the ancient terraces and recent alluvial deposits show that the deposit materials are derived from the dykes and foliated gabbro source rocks. The image interpretation is compared to the geological map, verified in the field and confirmed through laboratory analyses.

40|$|A {{complete}} dismembered {{sequence of}} ophiolite is well exposed {{in the south}} Andaman region that mainly comprises ultramafic cumulates, serpentinite mafic plutonic and <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks,</b> pillow lava, radiolarian chert, and plagiogranite. Pillow lavas of basaltic composition occupy {{a major part of}} the Andaman ophiolite suite (AOS). These basalts are well exposed all along the east coast of southern part of the south AOS. Although these basalts are altered due to low-grade metamorphism and late hydrothermal processes, their igneous textures are still preserved. These basalts are mostly either aphyric or phyric in nature. Aphyric type exhibits intersertal or variolitic textures, whereas phyric variety shows porphyritic or sub-ophitic textures. The content of alkalies and silica classify these basalts as sub-alkaline basalts and alkaline basalts. A few samples show basaltic andesite, trachy-basalt, or basanitic chemical composition. High-field strength element (HFSE) geochemistry sug-gests that studied basalt samples are probably derived from similar parental magmas. Al 2 O 3 /TiO 2 and CaO/TiO 2 ratios classify these basalts as high-Ti type basalt. On the basis of these ratios and many discriminant functions and diagrams, it is suggested that the studied basalts, associated with Andaman ophiolite suite, were derived from magma similar to N-MORB and emplaced in the mid-oceanic ridge tectonic setting. 1...|$|R
40|$|In {{addition}} to some mafic dykes which are already known {{and which were}} resampled, a number of mafic dykes were discovered in the Shackleton Range during the 1987 / 88 GEISHA expedition and sampled for the first time. Field data for 29 dykes, as well as analytical results of petrographic, geochemical, and isotope-geochemistry studies on the basalts of 26 of these dykes, are presented and discussed. The mafic dykes can be subdivided into five groups {{on the basis of}} their petrography and degree of alteration. According to the geochemical analyses, the <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> are continental tholeiites. Geochemical characterization on the basis of trace-elements, especially rare earths, permits subdivision according to magma type. This subdivision shows reasonable agreement with the subdivision according to petrographic criteria. On the basis of radiometric dating and field relationships, the following ages can be assigned to the five groups of dykes: Group I, Early Jurassic; Groups II and III, early Palaeozoic (Middle Devonian to Late Ordovician?); Group IV, probably Late Proterozoic and Group V, probably Middle Proterozoic. These groups of mafic dykes, which can be regarded as indicating extension phases, are discussed with respect to the geotectonic history of the Shackleton Range, and comparisons with neighbouring regions are made...|$|R
40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. This report {{deals with the}} crystalline rocks of Southern Yorkes Peninsula. The Precambrian age of these is considered and the petrography discussed. The rocks are divided into the main varieties, which are as follows:- (i) Gneisses: (a) "Grey banded gneiss". (b) "Red gneissic granite". (c) "Augen gneisses". (d) Cape Spencer and Royston Head gneisses. (e) "Dark biotite granite". (ii) Amphibolites: (a) Conformable amphibolite bodies. (b) Altered <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks.</b> (iii) Pegmatites. The mineralogy and texture are described where necessary, and structural relations are considered. The older rocks in the Point Yorke area are described as possible metasediments containing the conformable amphibolite bodies which may represent metamorphosed basic flows or sills. The "red gneissic granite" is shown to have subsequently engulfed these rocks forming migmatites and injection gneisses, {{and many of the}} pegmatites of the area are tentatively related on structural evidence to this later activity. Rapakivi type porphyritic granites are common, usually as narrow zones related to intrusive contacts. The paper is concluded with a discussion concerning similarities between those rocks and rocks of other Precambrian terrains of the world. Thesis (B. Sc.

40|$|The basic {{requirements}} of reliable palaeomagnetic data for calculation of continental drift and past plate reconstructions {{are that the}} Natural Remanent Magnetization is primary, separated from younger overprints by multicomponent analysis {{and that it is}} statistically well defined. The age of the remanence is established by using rock units dated predominantly by the U-Pb method on zircon or baddeleyite. By using these criteria, the palaeomagnetists of Scandinavia have recently defined nine key palaeopoles ranging in age from 2446 Ma to 930 Ma. The oldest key pole was obtained from the 2446 Ma old gabbronorite dykes in Russian Karelia. A pole of the age of 1930 Ma isolated in the gabbro-diorite intrusion in Tsuomasvarri, in northern Finland. An 1880 Ma pole represents four separate syn- to late orogenic gabbro intrusions at the Svecofennian orogen in Finland and Sweden. A younger pole of 1840 Ma was obtained from the post-orogenic Haukivesi lamprophyre dykes in central Finland.

40|$|Fluid and melt {{inclusions}} in minerals of two native iron-bearing <b>dyke</b> <b>rocks</b> from Disko, Greenland, {{were investigated}} using {{heating and cooling}} microscopic techniques. The melt inclusions in olivine are homogenized at temperatures of 1170 – 1200 °C. The melts are characterized by high SiO 2, K 2 O and TiO 2 and low MgO contents. The co-existence of combined melt–fluid (gas) inclusions in olivine implies that the olivine phenocrysts crystallized from a heterogeneous magma at low pressure. Gas bubbles were investigated in {{the glass of the}} rock. Water and four crystalline phases were observed at room and low temperatures {{on the walls of the}} bubbles: serpentine, naphthalene, clathrate, and an unknown phase. The complex composition of trapped volatiles is reflected in considerable ranges of clathrate melting and solidus temperatures (20 to 7. 5 °C and − 82. 6 to − 73 °C, respectively). Melt equilibrium with metallic iron at T= 1450 K suggests that logfO 2 =− 13. 95. The calculated composition of C–O–H fluid in equilibrium with Fe, Fe 3 C and FeS is characterized by high CH 4 and H 2 contents. During cooling at the postmagmatic stage, polymerization proceeds, and heavy hydrocarbons are formed inside vesicles. The presence of organic compounds in inclusions trapped at a magmatic stage is a natural consequence of unusual reducing condition during crystallization...|$|R
