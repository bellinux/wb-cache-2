5|$|Although Herbert {{asserts that}} the many-worlds {{interpretation}} lacks the counterfactual definiteness required to prove Bell's theorem, <b>he</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the many-worlds view is inherently non-local, by any reasonable conception of locality.|$|E
5|$|A {{somewhat}} similar hypothesis was advanced by astronomer John J. Matese of the University of Louisiana at Lafayette in 2002. <b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> more comets are {{arriving in the}} inner Solar System from a particular region of the postulated Oort cloud than {{can be explained by}} the galactic tide or stellar perturbations alone, and that the most likely cause would be a Jupiter-mass object in a distant orbit. This hypothetical gas giant was nicknamed Tyche. The WISE mission, an all-sky survey using parallax measurements in order to clarify local star distances, was capable of proving or disproving the Tyche hypothesis. In 2014, NASA announced that the WISE survey had ruled out any object as they had defined it.|$|E
5|$|<b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the {{presentation}} of the Quran and its suras was dictated by Muhammad and that the task of Abu Bakr was to collect the Quran between its two covers and transcribe it into one copy, while Uthman's task was to fix the transcription and unify it to prevent variant readings. He also expresses doubts that Ali, as it is alleged, had made a chronologically arranged collection. Darwaza was very critical of other modern interpreters who used certain verses of the Quran to deduce and support scientific theories. He argues that those people have done harm to Islam by trivializing the sacred character of the Quran.|$|E

5|$|As Rana Bahadur Shah's {{bodyguard}} and advisor, Bhimsen Thapa also {{accompanied him}} to Varanasi. Rana Bahadur's retinue included his first wife, Raj Rajeshwari Devi, while his second wife, Subarna Prabha Devi, stayed back in Kathmandu {{to serve as}} the regent. Since Rana Bahadur was willing to do anything to regain his power and punish those who had forced him to exile, he served as a focal point of dissidenting factions in Varanasi. In November 1800, he first sought help from the British in exchange for which he was willing to concede a trading post in Kathmandu and grant them 37.5% of the tax revenue derived from the hills and 50% from the terai. However, the British were in favor of working with the existing government in Nepal, rather than risk the uncertainties of restoring an exiled ex-King to power. The Kathmandu Durbar was willing to appease the British and agreed to sign a commercial treaty so long as the wayward Rana Bahadur and his group were held in India under strict British surveillance. This arrangement was kept a secret from Rana Bahadur and his group; but when they eventually became aware of the strictures on their movement, and hence the treaty, they were incensed at the British as well as the proponents (Damodar Pande and his faction) of this treaty in Nepal. An intrigue was set in motion with the aim of splitting the unity of courtiers in Kathmandu Durbar and fomenting anti-British feelings. A flurry of letters were exchanged between the ex-King and individual courtiers in which he tried to set them up against Damodar Pande and tried to woo them by promises of high government positions, which they could hold for their entire life, and which could be inherited by their progeny. Baburam Acharya holds Bhimsen responsible for all these schemes, reasoning that Rana Bahadur did not have the mental capacity for such negotiations and intrigues. <b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> Bhimsen was responsible for negotiation with the British as well as responsible for writing letters {{in the name of the}} ex-King, while the ex-King was bidding his time in debauchery.|$|E

25|$|Sachs {{believes}} {{it is best to}} empower countries by utilizing their existing governments, rather than trying to circumnavigate them. He remarks that while the corruption argument is logically valid in that corruption harms the efficiency of aid, levels of corruption tend to be much higher on average for countries with low levels of GDP. <b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> this hurdle in government should not disqualify entire populations for much needed aid from the west.|$|E

25|$|Baldwin chronicled his seven-year {{battle to}} remain {{a part of his}} daughter's life in his 2008 book, co-authored with Mark Tabb, A Promise to Ourselves: A Journey Through Fatherhood and Divorce. Baldwin contends that after their {{separation}} in December 2000, his former wife, Kim Basinger, endeavored to deny him access to his daughter by refusing to discuss parenting, blocking visitation, not providing telephone access, not following court orders, not dropping their daughter off for reasons of convenience, and directly lobbying the child. <b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> she spent over $1.5 million in the effort. Baldwin called this parental alienation syndrome.|$|E
25|$|In the USA, {{on average}} {{one third of}} grade A {{students}} have cheated.

In the study mentioned above (in which students were allowed to bring crib sheets to a test but did not improve their scores), the researcher concluded that the students used the crib notes as alternatives to studying, rather than as complements to studying, and thus spent less time preparing for the exam.|$|E
25|$|Hartmann is {{considered}} to have progressive/liberal politics (although he describes himself {{as part of the}} radical middle). He is the author of numerous books, including , in which he argues that the 1886 U.S. Supreme Court decision in Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad Company (118 U.S. 394) did not actually grant corporate personhood, and that this doctrine derives from a mistaken interpretation of a Supreme Court clerk's notes. Hartmann considers this a clear contradiction of the intent of the Founding Fathers of the United States. He has also written on {{the separation of church and}} state, drawing upon The Federalist Papers to argue that the Founding Fathers warned against the notion of the United States being a Christian nation. <b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> the 2000 American election and 2004 American election were stolen through electronic tampering, denial of the voting franchise by rigged voting lists, and limiting availability of voting machines in selected precincts. He also accuses the Bush administration of eroding democracy and individual freedoms.|$|E

25|$|His {{subsequent}} book, {{released in}} summer 2006, is titled Conservatives without Conscience, {{a play on}} Barry Goldwater's book The Conscience of a Conservative. In it, he asserts that post-Goldwater conservatism has been co-opted by people with authoritarian personalities and policies, citing data from Bob Altemeyer. According to Dean, modern conservatism, specifically in the Christian Right, embraces obedience, inequality, intolerance, and strong intrusive government, {{in stark contrast to}} Goldwater's philosophies and policies. Using Altemeyer's scholarly work, <b>he</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> there is a tendency toward ethically questionable political practices when authoritarians are placed in positions of power, and that the current political situation is dangerously unsound because of it. Dean cites the behavior of key members of the Republican leadership, including George W. Bush, Dick Cheney, Tom DeLay, Newt Gingrich, and Bill Frist, as clear evidence of a relationship between modern right-wing conservatism and this authoritarian approach to governance. He places particular emphasis on the abdication of checks and balances by the Republican Congress, and of the dishonesty of the conservative intellectual class in support of the GOP, {{as a result of the}} obedience and arrogance innate to the authoritarian mentality.|$|E

ÄorÄeviÄ notes that BojiÄ's early poems reflect {{the degree to which}} he was {{influenced}} by the [...] "exalted sensuality" [...] of Baudelaire's works. <b>He</b> <b>contends</b> <b>that</b> Baudelaire's influence on BojiÄ's early work is [...] "rather unfortunate", as by striving to imitate Baudelaire's style, BojiÄ failed to achieve originality and instead merely used Baudelaire as a [...] "crutch in the absence of spontaneous emotion".|$|E
25|$|Philip Beardsley {{argued that}} {{applying}} a uniparadigmatic system to political science would be âmorally indefensible,â {{as it would}} involve arbitrarily choosing one view from among a large pool of fundamentally divergent political viewpoints.
