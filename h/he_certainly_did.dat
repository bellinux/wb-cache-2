Andrew was incorporated at the University of Glasgow in 1456, {{and he is}} found as a determinant, i.e. having completed his Bachelor's Degree, at the University of St Andrews in 1462 x 1463. He appears to have entered the University of Paris ad eundem in 1465. By 1460, he had become Dean of Moray, while retaining the Glasgow sub-deanery. In 1470, {{he may have been}} given the position of Provost of the Collegiate church of Lincluden, a position <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> hold in 1477.|$|E
25|$|St Chad's Well near Battle Bridge on {{the river}} Fleet in London was a celebrated {{medicinal}} well and had a new pump house built in 1832. It was destroyed by the Midland Railway company, and is remembered in the street name of St Chad's Place. There is no independent evidence of Chad's visiting the site, but it clearly is named after him, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> travel in southern England. His association with wells seems ancient, and no doubt stems from the St Chad's Well at Lichfield, visited by pilgrims and probably the water supply of his monastery. This {{is the most likely}} explanation of the name.|$|E
25|$|In 219 BC, Hannibal {{attacked}} {{the town of}} Saguntum, which stood under the special protection of Rome. According to Roman tradition, Hannibal {{had been made to}} swear by his father never to be a friend of Rome, and <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not take a conciliatory attitude when the Romans berated him for crossing the river Iberus (Ebro), which Carthage was bound by treaty not to cross. Hannibal did not cross the Ebro River (Saguntum was near modern Valencia – well south of the river) in arms, and the Saguntines provoked his attack by attacking their neighboring tribes who were Carthaginian protectorates and by massacring pro-Punic factions in their city. Rome had no legal protection pact with any tribe south of the Ebro River. Nonetheless, they asked Carthage to hand Hannibal over, and when the Carthaginian oligarchy refused, Rome declared war on Carthage.|$|E

2500|$|Deakin defined {{himself as}} an [...] "independent Australian Briton," [...] favouring a self-governing Australia but loyal to the British Empire. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not see {{federation}} as marking Australia's independence from Britain. On the contrary, Deakin was a supporter of closer empire unity, serving {{as president of the}} Victorian branch of the Imperial Federation League, a cause he believed to be a stepping stone to a more spiritual world unity.|$|E
2500|$|Did Jesus Exist?: The Historical Argument for Jesus of Nazareth [...] is a 2012 book by the {{academic}} and author Bart Ehrman, a leading scholar of the New Testament and writer of over twenty-five books (including three college textbooks) in that field of study. In the book, written to counter {{the idea that there}} was never such a person as Jesus Christ at all, Ehrman sets out to demonstrate the historical evidence for Jesus' existence, and he aims to state why all experts in the area agree that [...] "whatever else you may think about Jesus, <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> exist." ...|$|E

He provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which Mercadante also provided. By the end of August it appears that Romani had completed a considerable amount of the libretto, enough at least to allow Bellini to begin work, which <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> in the first weeks of September as the verses were supplied.

2500|$|For the {{forthcoming}} autumn/winter season, La Scala had engaged Giulia Grisi (the sister of Giuditta Grisi) and the well-known tenor Domenico Donzelli, {{who had made}} a name for himself with Rossini roles, especially that of Otello. They would fill the roles of Adalgisa and Pollione. Donzelli provided Bellini with precise details of his vocal capabilities which were confirmed by a report which the Neapolitan composer Saverio Mercadante also provided.

For Demetrius was so assiduous in keeping hot these hopes and projects in the king's mind, that Philip even dreamed of them in his sleep, and thought of nothing else but this Italian expedition. The motive of Demetrius in so acting was not a consideration for Philip, for <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> not rank higher than third in the calculations of Demetrius. A stronger motive than that was his hatred of Rome: but the strongest of all was the consideration of his own prospects. For he had made up his mind that it was only in this way that he could ever recover his principality in Pharos.|$|E
2500|$|The South Wales Club's first {{match was}} at The Oval, which would {{become one of}} Grace's {{favourite}} venues, and he scored 5 and 38 against the Surrey Club in addition to taking 4 wickets. The South Wales captain wanted to drop Grace for the second match against the Gentlemen of Sussex at the Royal Brunswick Ground in Hove, but Henry Grace intervened and insisted that Grace must play as he was [...] "recruited for both games". Henry Grace apparently informed the captain that no member of his family, including E.M. who was then the star turn, would represent South Wales in future. The captain backed down and Grace played at Hove but under great pressure to succeed. <b>He</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>did</b> succeed for he scored 170 and 56 not out. His innings of 170 was his first-ever century in a serious match. The third match, against Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) was Grace's debut at Lord's and he was joined by E.M. who had just disembarked from his voyage. Grace scored 50 in the first innings only three days after his sixteenth birthday.|$|E

60|$|Yes. That the Old Testament is not {{contrary}} to the New, I believe with my whole heart and soul. And therefore {{to those who say}} that the Apostles had solved the whole mystery of human life, its sins, its sorrows, its destinies, I must reply that such is not the case, at least with the most gifted of all the writers of the New Testament. We may think fit to claim omniscience for St Paul: but <b>he</b> <b>certainly</b> <b>does</b> not claim it for himself.|$|R
