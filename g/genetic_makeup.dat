5|$|After {{the islands}} were {{transferred}} to Scotland, thousands of Scots families emigrated to Shetland in the 16th and 17th centuries but studies of the <b>genetic</b> <b>makeup</b> of the islands' population indicate that Shetlanders are just under half Scandinavian in origin.

The Norn language was a form of Old Norse, which continued to be spoken until the 18th century when it was replaced by an insular dialect of Scots known as Shetlandic, which is in turn being replaced by Scottish English. Although Norn was spoken for hundreds of years it is now extinct and few written sources remain. Shetlandic is used both in local radio and dialect writing, and kept alive by the Shetland Folk Society.|$|E

5|$|The game series {{features}} {{many types}} of Tyrants {{as the result of}} several different experiments. Following the discovery of the Progenitor virus, the Umbrella Corporation’s founders become eager to create a Bio-Organic Weapon (BOW) that is both powerful and capable of following orders. Prior to the events of Resident Evil Zero, Umbrella used the Progenitor virus to create the Tyrant virus (T-virus), which they believe can be used to manufacture powerful organisms. A problem with the virus’ compatibility with humans set the project back, as only humans with a very rare <b>genetic</b> <b>makeup</b> are capable of mutating into potent and manageable life forms. Umbrella eventually overcame this setback by resorting to using clones of Sergei Vladimir, one of their executives who happens to be genetically compatible.|$|E
5|$|An individual's {{mitochondrial}} {{genes are}} not inherited {{by the same}} mechanism as nuclear genes. Typically, the mitochondria are inherited from one parent only. In humans, when an egg cell is fertilized by a sperm, the egg nucleus and sperm nucleus each contribute equally to the <b>genetic</b> <b>makeup</b> of the zygote nucleus. In contrast, the mitochondria, and therefore the mitochondrial DNA, usually come from the egg only. The sperm's mitochondria enter the egg, but do not contribute genetic information to the embryo. Instead, paternal mitochondria are marked with ubiquitin to select them for later destruction inside the embryo. The egg cell contains relatively few mitochondria, but it is these mitochondria that survive and divide to populate {{the cells of the}} adult organism. Mitochondria are, therefore, in most cases inherited only from mothers, a pattern known as maternal inheritance. This mode is seen in most organisms, including the majority of animals. However, mitochondria in some species can sometimes be inherited paternally. This is the norm among certain coniferous plants, although not in pine trees and yews. For Mytilids, paternal inheritance only occurs within males of the species. It has been suggested that it occurs at a very low level in humans. There is a recent suggestion that mitochondria that shorten male lifespan stay in the system because they are inherited only through the mother. By contrast, natural selection weeds out mitochondria that reduce female survival as such mitochondria {{are less likely to be}} passed on to the next generation. Therefore, it is suggested that human females and female animals tend to live longer than males. The authors claim that this is a partial explanation.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{diversification}} of Sino-Tibetan populations {{have been a}} long-standing hot debate. However, the limited genetic information of Tibetan populations keeps this topic far from clear. In the present study, we genotyped 15 forensic autosomal STRs from 803 unrelated Tibetan individuals from Gansu Province (635 from Gannan and 168 from Tianzhu). We combined these data with published dataset to infer a detailed population affinities and admixture of Sino-Tibetan populations. Our results revealed that the genetic structure of Sino-Tibetan populations was strongly correlated with linguistic affiliations. Although the among-population variances are relatively small, the genetic components for Tibetan, Lolo-Burmese, and Han Chinese were quite distinctive, especially for the Deng, Nu, and Derung of Lolo-Burmese. Southern indigenous populations, such as Tai-Kadai and Hmong-Mien populations might have made substantial genetic contribution to Han Chinese and Altaic populations, but not to Tibetans.

40|$|If {{maternal}} expressed {{emotion is}} an environmental {{risk factor for}} children’s antisocial behavior problems, it should account for behavioral differences between siblings {{growing up in the}} same family even after genetic influences on children’s behavior problems are taken into account. This hypothesis was tested in the Environmental Risk Longitudinal Twin Study with a nationally representative 1994 – 1995 birth cohort of twins. The authors interviewed the mothers of 565 five-year-old monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs and established which twin in each family received more negative emotional expression and which twin received more warmth. Within MZ pairs, the twin receiving more maternal negativity and less warmth had more antisocial behavior problems. Qualitative interviews were used to generate hypotheses about why mothers treat their children differently. The results suggest that maternal emotional attitudes toward children may play a causal {{role in the development of}} antisocial behavior and illustrate how genetically informative research can inform tests of socialization hypotheses. Children who are reared in the same family by the same parents are often remarkably different from each other.

40|$|Incretin hormones, such as glucose-dependent insulinotropic {{polypeptide}} and glucagon-like peptide- 1, are secreted on oral nutrient ingestion {{and regulate}} postprandial glucose homeostasis by conveying the signal of intestinal glucose flux. In East Asians, the secretion of glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide and glucagon-like peptide- 1 is not reduced in {{type 2 diabetes}} relative to normal glucose tolerance. Although the incretin effect is blunted in European patients with type 2 diabetes, a few East Asian studies showed {{no difference in the}} incretin effect between type 2 diabetes and normal glucose tolerance. Interestingly, the glucose-lowering efficacy of dipeptidyl peptidase- 4 inhibitors or glucagon-like peptide- 1 receptor agonists was reported to be greater in Asians than in non-Asians. The difference in the treatment responses could be ascribed to a different pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes (lower insulin secretory function and less insulin resis-tance), lower body mass index, different <b>genetic</b> <b>makeups,</b> preserved incretin effect and different food compositions in East Asians compared with other ethnic groups. Based on the currently available data, incretin-based therapies appear to be safe and well tolerated in East Asians. Nevertheless, continuous pharmacovigilance is required.

40|$|Inflammation {{and cancer}} {{are the two}} major {{disorders}} in the gastrointestinal tract. They are causally related in their pathogenesis. It is important to study animal models' causal relationship and, in particular, to discover new therapeutic agents for such diseases. There are several criteria for these models {{in order to make}} them useful in better understanding the etiology and treatment of the said diseases in humans. In this regard, animal models should be similar as possible to human diseases and also be easy to produce and reproducible and also economic to allow a continuous replication in different laboratories. In this review, we summarize the various animal models for inflammatory and cancerous disorders in the upper and lower gastrointestinal tract. Experimental approaches are as simple as by giving a single oral dose of alcohol or other noxious agents or by injections of multiple dosages of ulcer inducing agents or by parenteral administration or in drinking water of carcinogens or by modifying the <b>genetic</b> <b>makeups</b> of animals to produce relatively long-term pathological changes in particular organs. With these methods they could induce consistent inflammatory responses or tumorigenesis in the gastrointestinal mucosa.

40|$|A major {{challenges}} {{in the analysis of}} large and complex biomedical data is to develop an approach for 1) identifying distinct subgroups in the sampled populations, 2) characterizing their relationships among subgroups, and 3) developing a prediction model to classify subgroup memberships of new samples by finding a set of predictors. Each subgroup can represent different pathogen serotypes of microorganisms, different tumor subtypes in cancer patients, or different <b>genetic</b> <b>makeups</b> of patients related to treatment response. This paper proposes a composite model for subgroup identification and prediction using biclusters. A biclustering technique is first used to identify a set of biclusters from the sampled data. For each bicluster, a subgroup-specific binary classifier is built to determine if a particular sample is either inside or outside the bicluster. A composite model, which consists of all binary classifiers, is constructed to classify samples into several disjoint subgroups. The proposed composite model neither depends on any specific biclustering algorithm or patterns of biclusters, nor on any classification algorithms. The composite model was shown to have an overall accuracy of 97. 4 % for a synthetic dataset consisting of four subgroups. The model was applied to two datasets where the sample's subgroup memberships were known. The procedure showed 83. 7 % accuracy in discriminating lung cancer adenocarcinoma and squamous carcinoma subtypes, and was able to identify 5 serotypes and several subtypes with about 94 % accuracy in a pathogen dataset. The composite model presents a novel approach to developing a biclustering-based classification model from unlabeled sampled data. The proposed approach combines unsupervised biclustering and supervised classification techniques to classify samples into disjoint subgroups based on their associated attributes, such as genotypic factors, phenotypic outcomes, efficacy/safety measures, or responses to treatments. The procedure is useful for identification of unknown species or new biomarkers for targeted therapy...|$|R

40|$|At a {{time when}} the human genome has nearly been sequenced and the genomes of various organisms have already been completed, there is a plethora of {{information}} waiting to be uncovered in the sequences that make up these genes. Despite such initial breakthroughs in terms of discovering the <b>genetic,</b> structural <b>makeup</b> of organisms, a formidable task lies ahead: to be able to determine the functions of all these genetic sequences. As Mark Schena of Stanford University observes, “Understanding human behavior, disease and other health issues thus requires more than just a knowledge of genes and genomes: one must understand the cellular, physiological, cultural and ecological context in which genomic instructions are being read (1). ” Indeed, the billions of DNA bases alone do not directly tell us about the function of genes, cellular processes, and mechanisms of disease.

40|$|DNA {{replication}} {{and cell}} proliferation are intensely studied subjects. There have been countless experiments and hours put into better understanding how DNA is replicated and compacted, and how cells {{are able to}} proliferate with this new DNA. While {{there have been many}} breakthroughs throughout history in these subjects, the progress has been at times, slow. Advancing technologies have made studying biological phenomena easier as time progresses. The mysteries that still surround life are being uncovered with new vigor and at hastening paces. With the advent of the genome-wide association study (GWAS), researchers are able to determine gene functions based off of the variation already present in life. By examining multitudes of specimens with slightly differing <b>genetic</b> <b>makeups,</b> researchers are able to deduce gene function from those slight variations. A small single nucleotide can have resounding effects on organisms, such as with sickle cell anemia, or Tay-Sachs; both diseases caused by only a single nucleotide being different from the norm, or point mutation. GWA studies work with a similar principle in mind. By looking at all single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), we can deduce that any phenotypic changes observed in our specimens are caused by these slight changes in the genetic code.   	The Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel is a GWAS using the organism Drosophila melanogaster. This is a relatively new GWA, developed by Dr. Trudy McKay from NC State University (NCSU). Already there are over 200 strains that are genetically different from the others. By analyzing specific traits, known as quantitative traits, or traits which can be marked by a number, we can deduce what genetic factors could be playing a role in the traits observed. For this study, we will be observing DNA quantity for DNA replication, nucleus size with DNA quantity for DNA compaction, and nuclei counts for cell proliferation. By quantifying these traits for each strain, we will then {{be able to use the}} DGRP pipeline to uncover new genetic players in these traits. Some genes may have a role in all traits studied, some may only be involved in one, and some may not have a direct role at all, and only play an indirect regulatory role. While all of this is unknown at the moment, this study hopes to unveil the genetic players that have a high likelihood of being involved in one or more of these traits. Once these genetic markers have been unveiled, new studies can be done to specifically target these genes to allow for more concrete evidence to be provided in support of their roles in the studied traits.   M.
