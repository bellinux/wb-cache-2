5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected,</b> he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I ever saw, and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E

500|$|For his PhD thesis, Sommerfeld {{suggested}} that Bethe examine electron diffraction in crystals. As a starting point, Sommerfeld suggested Paul Ewald's 1914 paper on X-ray diffraction in crystals. Bethe later recalled {{that he became}} too ambitious, and, in pursuit of greater accuracy, his calculations became unnecessarily complicated. [...] When he met Wolfgang Pauli for the first time, Pauli told him: [...] "After Sommerfeld's tales about you, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> much better from you than your thesis." [...] "I guess from Pauli," [...] Bethe later recalled, [...] "that was a compliment." ...|$|E

60|$|Yes, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> {{always known}} {{that this was the}} one flaw in my dedication, but how could <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> her to <b>have</b> the wit to see it? I was very depressed.|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> to {{find that}} [...] was {{directly}} responsible for looting and stealing of paintings that he wanted for himself, and I couldn't find any evidence of it, I found evidence that he paid for them; sometimes at knock-down prices, but not direct theft in any way. [...] I was quite surprised by this, and I have to say in all honesty that's what I found.|$|E
2500|$|According to Jefferson Airplane's Spencer Dryden, {{the idea}} for [...] "a kind of Woodstock West" [...] began when he and bandmate Jorma Kaukonen {{discussed}} the staging of a free concert with the Grateful Dead and Rolling Stones in Golden Gate Park. Referring to the Stones, Dryden said, [...] "Next to the Beatles they were the biggest rock and roll band in the world, and we wanted them to experience what we were experiencing in San Francisco." [...] As plans were being finalized, Jefferson Airplane were on the road, and by early December they were in Florida, believing the concert plans for Golden Gate Park were proceeding. But by December 4, the plans had broken down, in Paul Kantner's account, because the city and police departments were unhelpful; innate conflict between the hippies of Haight-Ashbury and the police was manifested in obstructiveness. Sears Point Raceway was suggested, but its owners wanted $100,000 in escrow from the Rolling Stones. At the last moment, Dick Carter offered his Altamont Speedway in Alameda County for the festival. Jefferson Airplane flew out of Miami on December 5. Kantner said the location was taken {{in a spirit of}} desperation: [...] "There was no way to control it, no supervision or order." [...] According to Grace Slick, [...] "The vibes were bad. Something was very peculiar, not particularly bad, just real peculiar. It was that kind of hazy, abrasive and unsure day. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>expected</b> the loving vibes of Woodstock but that wasn't coming at me. This was a whole different thing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very much," [...] our visitor said, {{with the}} fine irony {{characteristic}} of him. [...] "All the more because I hadn't expected {{that sort of}} thing of you. What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>expected</b> of you hitherto was something more of the major morality." ...|$|R
