30|$|TEP deterministic, stochastic, and all <b>fault</b> classes <b>diagnosis</b> are {{studied to}} verify the {{effectiveness}} of the proposed method in complex process. Consensus theory is employed for fusion of results provided by different sources The results show with only small quantity of training data provided and the testing data being much more different from training data, the performances of deterministic or stochastic <b>faults</b> <b>diagnosis</b> is better than or equally well as multivariate statistics based approaches studied in [17]. Several faults deemed as unobservable for multivariate statistic based approaches can be also recognized more easily. Deterministic <b>faults</b> <b>diagnosis</b> fares better than the stochastic <b>faults</b> <b>diagnosis,</b> since deterministic ones are apt to form similar or regular trends regardless of specified faulty conditions and noise levels while stochastic ones fail to retain basic morphologies for signal patterns. It is also noted that for some real-time applications, signal template sets provided by only one or two PCs is recommended to reduce computational cost. The future work also lies in diagnosing more diverse or multiple faults in TEP or other complex processes to improve the proposed methods. Besides, Ku et al. [19] pointed DPCA model was expected to perform better than regular PCA on the TEP problem. DPCA could be introduced to extract more information in data set.|$|R
