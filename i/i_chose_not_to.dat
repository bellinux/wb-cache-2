25|$|Finally, William <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> abdicate and {{appointed}} Count Otto von Bismarck as Prime Minister of Prussia on 22 September. Leader of the Conservative Party, the politician {{was willing to}} rule without parliamentary majority and even without authorised budget. The King {{was pleased with the}} situation, but his wife, the liberal Queen Augusta, and especially his son and daughter-in-law, harshly criticised the decision. However, Bismarck remained {{at the head of the}} Prussian government and subsequently of the German government until 1890 and was instrumental in the isolation of the Crown Prince and his wife.|$|E
25|$|The Castilian fleet {{divided and}} part of the ships headed to the Llobregat river to get water. There they were confronted by many peasants of Barcelona and Sant Boi, and Peter I reorganized his forces and sailed to Ibiza, where he placed its castle under siege. Peter IV {{gathered}} a force of 50 galleys collected from Collioure, which he entrusted to Admiral Count of Osona with Cardona as vice-admiral. Relieving the island, the Castilian army left the siege and reembarked. Though he had numerical advantage, Peter <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> join the battle and withdrew. He was pursued by 15 or 20 galleys under Bernat de Cabrera. This force then anchored at the Denia estuary. The Castilians were then willing of fight, but as the Aragonese position was strong and supported by land forces, Peter I decided to sail back to Seville. Upon his arrival, Peter found that his armies had been defeated on 22 September in the largest land battle of the war at Araviana.|$|E

In 1989, she participated in recording [...] "Do They Know It's Christmas?" [...] under the name Band Aid II to help raise money. In early 2010, Minogue along with many other artists (under the name Helping Haiti) recorded a cover version of [...] "Everybody Hurts". The single was a fundraiser to help after the 2010 Haiti earthquake. She also spent a week in Thailand after the 2005 tsunami. During her 2011 Aphrodite World Tour, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami struck Japan, which was on her itinerary. She declared she would continue to tour there, stating, [...] "I was here to do shows and <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> cancel, Why did I choose not to cancel? I thought long and hard about it and it wasn't an easy decision to make." [...] While she was there, she and Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard were star guests at an Australian Embassy fundraiser for the disaster.|$|E

2500|$|Throughout {{most of her}} career, Baez {{remained}} {{apprehensive about}} involving herself in party politics. However, on February 3, 2008, Baez {{wrote a letter to}} the editor at the San Francisco Chronicle endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election. She noted: [...] "Through all those years, <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> engage in party politics.... At this time, however, changing that posture feels like the responsible thing to do. If anyone can navigate the contaminated waters of Washington, lift up the poor, and appeal to the rich to share their wealth, it is Sen. Barack Obama." [...] Playing at the Glastonbury Festival in June, Baez said during the introduction of a song that one reason she likes Obama is because he reminds her of another old friend of hers: Martin Luther King, Jr.|$|E
2500|$|The {{film was}} made without Twin Peaks series regulars Lara Flynn Boyle, Sherilyn Fenn, and Richard Beymer. At the time, these {{absences}} {{were attributed to}} scheduling conflicts, but in a 1995 interview, Fenn said that her real reason was that she [...] "was extremely disappointed {{in the way the}} second season got off track. As far as Fire Walk with Me, it was something that <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be a part of." [...] In a 2014 interview, however, Fenn said that it was ultimately a scheduling conflict with Of Mice and Men that prevented her from committing to the film. Fenn's character was cut from the script, Moira Kelly was cast as Donna, and Beymer's scenes were not filmed. In a September 2007 interview, Beymer claimed that he did not appear in any scenes shot for the film, although his character, Benjamin Horne, appeared in the script.|$|E

2500|$|Andrew first {{appears in}} the [...] "Pilot" [...] of season one. His first {{speaking}} role is arguing with his mother, Bree, over her desire for perfection. He is attached to his father, Rex, and is upset when Bree tries to cover up their impending divorce. When he confronts her about her lies after she discovers he lied to her, she says, [...] "Just because <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> share my marital problems with you does not give {{you the right to}} be rude!": and Andrew replies, [...] "How about driving my father away? Do I get to be rude then?", and shuts the door in her face. Andrew repeatedly breaks the rules during Season 1, infuriating Bree, who eventually humiliates him by turning up at the strip club he is visiting with his friends while grounded. Bree does later apologize to Andrew (who also admits how much he misses his father) for lying to him, but removes the door to his room in punishment for him smoking marijuana.|$|E

6000|$|There {{was really}} the touch of grace in my poor friend's divagations--the disheartened dandy had so {{positively}} turned rhapsodist and seer. I was particularly struck with his having laid aside the diffidence and self-consciousness of {{the first days of}} our acquaintance. He had become by this time a disembodied observer and critic; the shell of sense, growing daily thinner and more transparent, transmitted the tremor of his quickened spirit. He seemed to pick up acquaintances, in the course of our contemplations, merely by putting out his hand. If I left him for ten minutes I was sure to find him on my return in earnest conversation with some affable wandering scholar. Several young men with whom he had thus established relations invited him to their rooms and entertained him, as I gathered, with rather rash hospitality. For myself, <b>I</b> <b>chose</b> <b>not</b> <b>to</b> be present at these symposia; I shrank partly from being held in any degree responsible for his extravagance, partly from the pang of seeing him yield to champagne and an admiring circle. He reported such adventures with less keen a complacency than I had supposed he might use, but a certain method in his madness, a certain dignity in his desire to fraternise, appeared to save him from mischance. If they didn't think him a harmless lunatic they certainly thought him a celebrity of the Occident. Two things, however, grew evident--that he drank deeper than was good for him and that the flagrant freshness of his young patrons rather interfered with his predetermined sense of the element of finer romance. At the same time it completed his knowledge of the place. Making the acquaintance of several tutors and fellows, he dined in hall in half a dozen colleges, alluding afterwards to these banquets with religious unction. One evening after a participation indiscreetly prolonged he came back to the hotel in a cab, accompanied by a friendly undergraduate and a physician and looking deadly pale. He had swooned away on leaving table and remained so rigidly unconscious as much to agitate his banqueters. The following twenty-four hours he of course spent in bed, but on the third day declared himself strong enough to begin afresh. On his reaching the street his strength once more forsook him, so that I insisted on his returning to his room. He besought me with tears in his eyes not to shut him up. [...] "It's my last chance--I want to go back for an hour to that garden of Saint John's. Let me eat and drink--to-morrow I die." [...] It seemed to me possible that with a Bath-chair the expedition might be accomplished. The hotel, it appeared, possessed such a convenience, which was immediately produced. It became necessary hereupon that we should have a person to propel the chair. As there was no one on the spot at liberty I was about to perform the office; but just as my patient had got seated and wrapped--he now had a perpetual chill--an elderly man emerged from a lurking-place near the door and, with a formal salute, offered to wait upon the gentleman. We assented, and he proceeded solemnly to trundle the chair before him. I recognised him as a vague personage whom I had observed to lounge shyly about the doors of the hotels, at intervals during our stay, with a depressed air of wanting employment and a poor semblance of finding it. He had once indeed in a half-hearted way proposed himself as an amateur cicerone for a tour through the colleges; and I now, as I looked at him, remembered with a pang that I had too curtly declined his ministrations. Since then his shyness, apparently, had grown less or his misery greater, for it was with a strange grim avidity that he now attached himself to our service. He was a pitiful image of shabby gentility and the dinginess of [...] "reduced circumstances." [...] He would have been, I suppose, some fifty years of age; but his pale haggard unwholesome visage, his plaintive drooping carriage and the irremediable disarray of his apparel seemed to add to the burden of his days and tribulations. His eyes were weak and bloodshot, his bold nose was sadly compromised, and his reddish beard, largely streaked with grey, bristled under a month's neglect of the razor. In all this rusty forlornness lurked a visible assurance of our friend's having known better days. Obviously he was the victim of some fatal depreciation in the market value of pure gentility. There had been something terribly affecting in the way he substituted for the attempt to touch the greasy rim of his antiquated hat some such bow as one man of the world might make another. Exchanging a few words with him as we went I was struck with the decorum of his accent. His fine whole voice should have been congruously cracked.|$|E
