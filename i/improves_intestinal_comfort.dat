40|$|BACKGROUND—High dose growth hormone, glutamine, {{and a high}} {{carbohydrate}} diet may <b>improve</b> <b>intestinal</b> {{function in}} short bowel patients.  AIMS—To investigate if growth hormone with glutamine and no change in diet <b>improved</b> <b>intestinal</b> function.  PATIENTS AND METHODS—Eight short bowel patients were randomised in a double blind crossover study between placebo and growth hormone (mean 0. 12  mg/kg/day) with oral (mean 28  g/day) and parenteral glutamine (mean 5. 2  g/day) for 28  days. Balance studies were performed at baseline and five days after placebo and treatment were terminated. Dietary energy, carbohydrate, and fat were maintained as usual.  RESULTS—Growth hormone with glutamine did not <b>improve</b> <b>intestinal</b> absorption of energy (baseline, placebo, treatment, mean: 46 %, 48 %, 46 % of oral intake, respectively), carbohydrate (71 %, 70 %, 71 %), fat (20 %, 15 %, 18 %), nitrogen (27 %, 18 %, 19 %), wet weight (37 %, 39 %, 31 %), sodium (− 16 %, − 16 %, − 36 %), potassium (43 %, 47 %, 33 %), calcium (− 16 %, − 16 %, − 15 %) or magnesium (− 3 %, 4 %, 2 %) compared with placebo or baseline (p> 0. 05) five days after treatment was terminated.

No effective prophylactic treatment is available for these patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to ascertain whether zinc supplementation may <b>improve</b> <b>intestinal</b> permeability. Methods: We studied 12 patients with quiescent Crohn's disease who had been in remission for at least 3 months and had increased {{intestinal permeability}} on two separate occasions within the last 2 months. Patients received oral zinc sulfate supplements (110 mg three times a day) for 8 weeks and were followed-up for 12 months thereafter to monitor relapses.

Methods: Sprague Dawley rats were given Lieber-DeCarli ethanol liquid diet once daily for 6 weeks to induce alcoholic liver injury. In step one, U 17 (1716) table of uniform design was adopted to design the experiment and the eight herbs of Jianpi Huoxue Decoction were screened to seek the herbs which play the main role. Three {{and a half hours}} before the rats were killed, each rat was administered lipopolysaccharide once, then blood sample was collected from portal vein and endotoxin content in plasma was detected as the index of intestinal permeability. The data were analyzed by stepwise regression to find the herbal drugs which had the best effects and the compatibility ratio of these drugs. In step two, the rats with Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet-induced liver injury were divided into four groups to test and verify the results. Results: According to the obtained regression equation, Rasux Paeoniae Alba (Baishao), Rhizoma Alismatis (Zexie) and Fructus Schisandrae Chinensis (Wuweizi) were the main herbal drugs in Jianpi Huoxue Decoction in <b>improving</b> <b>intestinal</b> permeability, and the doses for rats were 1. 33, 0. 50 and 0. 17 g/kg respectively.

Parenteral and certain elemental diets {{have been shown to}} impair intestinal barrier function, whereas fiber has been shown to protect against nutritionally induced bacterial translocation. However, the factors responsible for these phenomenon have not been fully determined. METHODS. Intestinal mucin levels, mucosal protein content, slgA, intestinal morphology, and permeability to horseradish peroxidase, bacterial translocation, and intestinal bacterial population levels were measured in rats 7 days after receiving total parenteral nutrition (TPN) solution (28 % glucose, 4. 25 % amino acids; 307 kcal/kg/day) enterally (ORAL-TPN) or parenterally (IV-TPN) with or without enteral bulk fiber supplementation. Chow-fed rats served as control subjects. RESULTS. The incidence of bacterial translocation in the ORAL-TPN and IV-TPN groups was reduced significantly by the provision of fiber (p < 0. 05). Mucosal protein, slgA, and insoluble mucin levels were decreased in the jejunum of the ORAL-TPN and IV-TPN groups, with mucosal protein levels being decreased {{to a greater extent than}} slgA or mucin.

MethodsMale C 57 BL/ 6 mice were fed a HFD (60 % kcal fat) or a regular/control diet (RD) (18 % kcal fat) for 13 weeks. Serum and fecal endotoxin levels were measured, and relative amounts of specific gut bacteria in the feces were assessed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. Intestinal transit was measured by fluorescent-labeled marker and a bead expulsion test. Enteric neurons were assessed by immunostaining. Oligofructose (OFS) supplementation with RD or HFD for 5 weeks also was studied. In vitro studies were performed using primary enteric neurons and an enteric neuronal cell line. ResultsHFD-fed mice had reduced numbers of enteric nitrergic neurons and showed delayed gastrointestinal transit compared with RD-fed mice. HFD-fed mice had higher fecal Firmicutes and Escherichia coli and lower Bacteroidetes compared with RD-fed mice. OFS supplementation protected against enteric nitrergic neuron loss in HFD-fed mice, and <b>improved</b> <b>intestinal</b> transit time. OFS supplementation resulted in a reduction in fecal Firmicutes and Escherichia coli and serum endotoxin levels.

40|$|Aims/hypothesis Impaired {{intestinal}} {{barrier function}} is observed in type I diabetes patients and animal {{models of the}} disease. Exposure to diabetogenic antigens from the intestinal milieu due to a compromised intestinal barrier is considered essential for induction of the autoimmune process leading to type I diabetes. Since a hydrolysed casein (HC) diet prevents autoimmune diabetes onset in diabetes-prone (DP) -BioBreeding (BB) rats, we studied {{the role of the}} HC diet on intestinal barrier function and, therefore, prevention of autoimmune diabetes onset in this animal model. Methods DP-BB rats were fed the HC diet from weaning onwards and monitored for autoimmune diabetes development. Intestinal permeability was assessed in vivo by lactulose mannitol test and ex vivo by measuring trans-epithelial electrical resistance (TEER). Levels of serum zonulin, a physiological tight junction modulator, were measured by ELISA. heal mRNA expression of Myo 9 b, Cldn 1, Cldn 2 and Ocln (which encode the tight junction-related proteins myosin IXb, claudin- 1, claudin- 2 and occludin) and Il- 10, Tgf-beta (also known as Il 10 and Tgfb, respectively, which encode regulatory cytokines) was analysed by quantitative PCR. Results The HC diet reduced autoimmune diabetes by 50 % in DP-BB rats. In DP-BB rats, prediabetic gut permeability negatively correlated with the moment of autoimmune diabetes onset. The <b>improved</b> <b>intestinal</b> barrier function that was induced by HC diet in DP-BB rats was visualised by decreasing lactulose:mannitol ratio, decreasing serum zonulin levels and increasing ileal TEER.

Oligofructose (OFS) supplementation with RD or HFD for 5 weeks also was studied. InÂ vitro studies were performed using primary enteric neurons and an enteric neuronal cell line. Results: HFD-fed mice had reduced numbers of enteric nitrergic neurons and showed delayed gastrointestinal transit compared with RD-fed mice. HFD-fed mice had higher fecal Firmicutes and Escherichia coli and lower Bacteroidetes compared with RD-fed mice. OFS supplementation protected against enteric nitrergic neuron loss in HFD-fed mice, and <b>improved</b> <b>intestinal</b> transit time. OFS supplementation resulted in a reduction in fecal Firmicutes and Escherichia coli and serum endotoxin levels. InÂ vitro, palmitate activation of TLR 4 induced enteric neuronal apoptosis in a Phosphoâc-Jun N-terminal kinaseâdependent pathway. This apoptosis was prevented by a c-Jun N-terminal kinase inhibitor and in neurons from TLR 4 -/- mice. Conclusions: Together our data suggest that intestinal dysbiosis in HFD-fed mice contribute to the delayed intestinal motility by inducing a TLR 4 -dependent neuronal loss. Manipulation of gut microbiota with OFS <b>improved</b> <b>intestinal</b> motility in HFD mice. Keywords: Myenteric Neurons, Palmitate, Gut Microbiota, LPS, TLR 4, Colon Transi...|$|R
