40|$|As the world's {{population}} is expanding, the global demand for energy {{will continue to}} increase. The global demand for all energy will grow by over 50 % the next 25 years. New technology and renewable energy will help us face these challenges, but an essential breakthrough in {{oil and gas production}} and exploration is also needed. The most common method for secondary oil recovery is water flooding implemented early during the primary production phase. This is done by forcing water down the injection wells in order to maintain reservoir pressure above bubble point, and to sweep the oil towards the production wells. Micro- and nano- technologies have already proved to be important in technical advances in a variety of industries, and the potential in upstream petroleum industry is great. Nanotechnology will have the ability to improve the industry when it comes to energy supply, by introducing technologies that are more efficient, and more environmental friendly. Many materials, tools and devices with qualities that cannot be matched by conventional technologies can be developed using nanotechnology. In this master's thesis I will look at the unique possibilities of using nanotechnology in oil and gas E&P. The thesis expands my project thesis, where I studied the potential for nanotechnology in exploration, drilling, production and especially enhanced oil recovery. Some believe that nanotechnology has the opportunity to increase the recovery factor up to 10 % in the future. This can be achieved by using for example tailored surfactant that can be added to the reservoir in a more controlled way than existing substances. Other applications could be “smart fluids” and new metering techniques for use in upstream petroleum industry. Experimental studies of the potential of hydrophilic silica nanoparticles have been carried out. Core flood experiments using Berea sandstone were performed to assess the potential in nanoparticle <b>flooding.</b> <b>Permeability</b> impairment was studied by flooding, and clear identification of retention was observed. It showed that concentration, injection volume and rate are important parameters when injecting particles through a porous media. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) was applied to detect any residual particles inside the core sample, which could explain permeability impairments. Further, implementations of silica nanofluid as both secondary and tertiary recovery method were tested. The results showed little mobilization when implemented as tertiary recovery method, but a clear reduction of residual oil saturation was observed when applying as secondary recovery method. Using nanoparticles in EOR is currently only tested at laboratory scale, but integrating this in large scale fields could improve the lifetime, recovery and make oil production even more economically beneficial. This thesis summarizes available information within the topic, and performs laboratory experiments in order to study the potential of hydrophilic silica nanoparticles for EOR purposes. </p...|$|E

A statistical analysis allowed to calculate the permeability of each unit combining information on soil and land use and so to propose a permeability map for the catchment. This map was validated using the runoff model STREAM. With this model, correlation between simulated and observed discharges (0. 83) is satisfactory when using distributed soil permeability for Gardon d'Anduze catchment or Mialet and Saumane sub catchment. Correlation significantly decreases (0. 66) when using STREAM with an homogeneous averaged permeability value of 30 mm/hour for the catchment.

30|$|Furthermore, {{improper}} {{interpretation of}} laboratory experimental data may also add further errors to reservoir simulation. In principle, three major approaches—analytical methods, semi-analytical methods and history-matching methods {{can be used}} to determine two-phase relative permeability from unsteady state displacement experiments (Hussain and Cinar 2010). However, analytical methods and semi-analytical methods failed to represent miscible <b>flooding</b> relative <b>permeability</b> for their ignorance of capillary pressure effects and vaporizing mechanism (Gu and Oliver 2005). History-matching methods iterate the laboratory core flooding pressure and production data by changing the relative permeability values. Unlike analytical and semi-analytical methods pointed defects can be removed easily. This possibility encourages us to use this inverse modeling technique to calculate CO 2 <b>flooding</b> relative <b>permeability</b> curves under near miscible and miscible conditions (Watson et al. 1984; Reynolds et al. 2004; Eydinov et al. 2007).

30|$|Fluid {{characteristics}} are generally black-oil or compositional PVT properties {{obtained in the}} laboratory by standardized procedures (Rogers and Grigg 2000). Very accurate determination of fluid properties can be obtained with current techniques. However, rock-fluid interactions such as adhesion, spreading and wettability affect the displacement in the reservoir. In reservoir simulators, rock-fluid interactions are generally lumped into one parameter—relative permeability. The relative permeability is the connecting link between the phase behavior and transport properties of the system. Relative permeability is an important petrophysical parameter, {{as well as a}} critical input parameter in predictive simulation of miscible <b>floods.</b> Relative <b>permeability</b> data are generally measured in the laboratory by standardized procedures with actual reservoir fluids and cores and at reservoir conditions (Rogers and Grigg 2000).|$|R

This grid block volume potentially exhibits a large degree of heterogeneity and if a core <b>flood</b> measured relative <b>permeability</b> curve is used to simulate such a large grid block, the important effects of scale dependency on the relative permeability curves and also on reservoir heterogeneity are neglected, thus significant errors may occur in simulation results (Cao and Aziz 1999).|$|R

The multiphase flow equations are solved in multi cases and in three-dimensional frameworks following the implicit pressure explicit saturation (IMPES) procedure in which {{the solution of the}} bacteria transport equations is solved implicitly whereas the nutrient transport equation is solved explicitly. The MEOR model was incorporated into an existing chemical flooding simulator (UTCHEM). The simulation results showed that the sharp increase of pressure after the microbial flooding is caused by pore plugging and the production of biogenic gas.

The importance of viscous forces during drainage core floods is evaluated using fluid viscosity as the varying parameter in CO 2 -brine core floods, and flow rate in N 2 -water core floods. A transition from a heterogeneous to a homogeneous displacement is observed with increasing viscous force applied to the core.

40|$|High {{vascular}} pressure targets {{the lung}} septal network, causing acute lung injury. While calcium entry in septal endothelium has been implicated, the channel involved is not known. This study tested {{the hypothesis that}} the vanilloid transient receptor potential channel, TRPV 4, is a critical participant in the permeability response to high vascular pressure. Isolated lungs from TRPV 4 +/+ or TRPV 4 −/− mice were studied at baseline or during high pressure challenge. Permeability was assessed via the filtration coefficient. Endothelial calcium transients were assessed using epifluorescence microscopy of the lung subpleural network. Light microscopy and point counting were used to determine the alveolar fluid volume fraction, a measure of alveolar <b>flooding.</b> Baseline <b>permeability,</b> calcium intensity, and alveolar flooding were no different in TRPV 4 +/+ versus TRPV 4 −/− lungs. In TRPV 4 +/+ lungs, the high pressure–induced permeability response was significantly attenuated by low calcium perfusate, the TRPV antagonist ruthenium red, the phospholipase A 2 inhibitor methyl arachidonyl fluorophosphonate, or the P 450 epoxygenase inhibitor propargyloxyphenyl hexanoic acid. Similarly, the high pressure–induced calcium transient in TRPV 4 +/+ lungs was attenuated with ruthenium red or the epoxygenase inhibitor. High vascular pressure increased the alveolar fluid volume fraction compared with control. In lungs from TRPV 4 −/− mice, permeability, calcium intensity, and alveolar fluid volume fraction were not increased. These data support a role for P 450 -derived epoxyeicosatrienoic acid–dependent regulation of calcium entry via TRPV 4 in the permeability response to high vascular pressure...|$|R
30|$|To avoid {{unreliable}} {{results obtained}} from the simulation of LSW <b>flooding,</b> the relative <b>permeability</b> and capillary pressure curves under high- and low-salinity condition were extracted from a recent research conducted by Omekeh et al. (2013). These high- and low-salinity relative permeability functions which {{were used for the}} general model are shown in Fig.  1 a. This figure indicates oil wetness behavior at the initial state of the reservoir and more water wetness after low-salinity water flooding, based on Craig’s rule (1971). As it can be seen in Fig.  1 b, LSW imbibition capillary pressure curve is situated above HSW curve which proves that the spontaneous imbibition in LSW condition is more dominant in comparison to HSW condition. By assumption of water flood injection at irreducible water saturation in this study, the imbibition capillary pressure curve must be applied rather than drainage capillary pressure. Note that the same two-phase relative permeability curves under high-salinity condition are used for base case simulation.|$|R
30|$|Two other tight {{limestone}} cores (called core 4 {{and core}} 5) {{were obtained from}} another well in the same field and used to study the effect of SC-CO 2 floods on the relative permeability. Core 4 has brine permeability of 0.63  md and porosity of 29  %, while core 5 has brine permeability of 0.81  md and effective porosity of 36  %. The cores were prepared as described previously and fully saturated with oil at irreducible water saturation (Swir). Water flooding of these cores was conducted at a constant pressure, and oil and water production were measured continuously as function of time until the water–oil ratio (WOR) reached about 100  %. Cores were then re-flooded with oil to establish a residual water saturation state followed by CO 2 flooding at 4, 000  psia and 250  °F. Once the cores were fully saturated with SC-CO 2 at irreducible oil saturation, the CO 2 injection stopped and water injection was initiated to completely saturate the core with water at residual oil saturation. Cores were then flooded with oil {{to prepare them for}} the post SC-CO 2 <b>flood</b> relative <b>permeability</b> measurements. Results indicated that the used cores in this phase of the work are water-wet cores. Produced oil and water interfacial tensions were measured as a function of pore volume injected (PVI). It is well known that changes in rock wettability and in IFT between oil and water can significantly affect the displacement process. The IFT between produced oil and brine was measured in this study using Spinning Drop Interfacial Tensiometer of Model 500, which was manufactured by Corexport Corporation in USA.|$|R

Through comparing with six proposals, the consequences indicated that CO 2 flooding technology could be applied in ultra-low permeability oilfield. Advanced CO 2 injection and the style of cycle CO 2 injection could both have good flooding effect and pressure maintenance degree. The best opportunity of Advanced CO 2 injection is 4 months.

Waterflooding has become standard practice for extending the productive life of many solution gas drive reservoirs, but has the disadvantage of leaving a substantial residual oil volume in the reservoir. Solvent flooding has been offered as a method whereby oil may be completely displaced from the reservoir, leaving no residual volume. Field results have demonstrated that solvent floods suffer from early solvent breakthrough and considerable oil by-passing owing to high solvent mobility. The injection of both water and solvent has been demonstrated to offer advantages. Water partially mitigates both the adverse mobility and high cost of solvent floods, while solvent mobilizes oil which would be left in the reservoir by water alone. The process is equally applicable to reservoirs currently at residual oil saturation (tertiary floods) and to reservoirs at maximum oil saturation (secondary floods). In stratified reservoirs high permeability layers may be preferentially swept by solvent <b>floods,</b> while low <b>permeability</b> layers may be scarcely swept at all. Presence or absence of transverse communication between layers can modify overall sweep efficiency. This work is a study of water-solvent injection in stratified reservoirs based on computer simulation results. Fractional oil recovery as a function of injected solvent fraction, permeability contrast between layers, initial oil saturation, and presence or absence of transverse communication between strata has been determined. Results are presented as a series of optimization curves. Permeability contrast between layers is shown to be the dominant control on fractional oil recovery. Transverse communicating reservoirs are shown to require a higher solvent-water ratio in order to attain recoveries comparable to transverse noncommunicating reservoirs. In actual field projects, water and solvent are injected alternately as discrete slugs. This process is known as "WAG" for "water-alternating-gas". In the simulations used in this study, continuous water-solvent injection at a fixed fraction rather than true WAG was employed. It is demonstrated that the two methods give equivalent results. In summary, this work is the first comprehensive study of the behavior of stratified reservoirs undergoing water-solvent injection...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the focus}} on {{enhancing}} the oil recovery from oil fields has increased. This is because of falling oil reserves and the increased oil price. Because of this {{there is a big}} focus on enhancing oil recovery (EOR) mechanisms in the petroleum industry. In this thesis, the EOR mechanism low salinity waterflooding has been investigated both in a literature review and in experiments on sandstone cores from the Frøy field in the North Sea. Usually injecting of saltwater into the reservoir is the main oil recovery technique. By doing this, the pressure in the field is kept high and the water can displace the oil. Freshwater is not used because the clay will start to swell and ruin the permeability in sandstones. In more recent years, laboratory experiments have shown that by decreasing the salinity of the injection water from 30. 000 ppm, which is typical saltwater salinity, to below 5. 000 ppm, oil droplets are released from the clay surface. The low salinity water affects the wettability and the interfacial tension leading to a reduction of the residual oil saturation. Pressure buildup is often observed during low salinity waterflooding. In this project, experiments have been carried out on seven cores from the Frøy field in the North Sea. Most of the cores were high permeable in the range of 3 - 4 D and had low clay minerals around 1, 5 - 5 %. The cores were prepared with crude oil from the Frøy field. During the waterflooding, the cores were flooded first with normal 100 % seawater then followed by low salinity water. Five of the seven cores which were flooded with low salinity water showed increased oil recovery between 5, 9 percentage points (pp) and 13, 9 pp, giving a mean of 7, 9 pp after reducing the salinity of the injection water from 43. 350 ppm to 435 ppm. The residual oil saturation was reduced with 6, 2 pp on average. Most of the increased oil production during low salinity waterflooding occurred after injecting 5 - 7 pore volume of low salinity water. It is therefore recommended to start low salinity waterflooding some time before oil production with normal seawater has ceased. After <b>flooding,</b> new air <b>permeability</b> tests were conducted. These tests showed that most of the cores had a reduction down to 30 - 40 % of the initial air permeability. Coreflooding by going directly to low salinity water showed the same recovery as flooding with normal seawater first. This shows that flooding with normal seawater does not affect the formation in a negative way before low salinity waterflooding. The conclusion of this project is that low salinity waterflooding enhances the oil recovery on most of the sandstone cores from the Frøy field. Since it varies which sandstone zones give an increased oil recovery by low salinity it is recommended to perform laboratory experiments on cores before considering low salinity waterflooding on a field scale. Further analysis of the effect of smectite in low salinity waterflooding is also recommended. </p...|$|R
40|$|Because a {{significant}} {{fraction of the}} world’s light oil reservoirs has already been produced, the technical and economic challenges of developing heavy oil fields is now unavoidable [1]. Water flooding {{has proven to be}} a less than adequate recovery mechanism for heavy oil fields, due to the unfavorable mobility ratio between water and oil, resulting in poor volumetric sweep efficiencies and low ultimate recovery factors. Consequently, reservoirs containing viscous crudes have reported recoveries of less than 20 % when utilizing water flooding as the recovery mechanism. Therefore, it is evident that there exists a huge potential for additional recovery by implementing improved oil recovery (IOR) projects, especially by employing enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods. Polymer flooding has gained increased attention during the last decades. Several field scale pilot projects have been implemented in heavy oil reservoirs with a varying degree of success [2] [3]. During polymer flooding, polymers are added to the injection brine to impart a viscosity increase of the corresponding polymer solution. This will increase the mobility of the drive fluid, and the mobility ratio between the displacing and displaced fluid will be more favorable. However, there are challenges concerning polymer flooding. The viscosity increasing feature of the polymer solution frequently induce large injection pressures and consequently may have detrimental effects on injectivity. Injectivity damage resulting from polymer flooding will in some instances require drilling of additional wells. This may negatively affect the economic feasibility of a polymer flood project [4]. Also, polymer loss due to retention mechanisms is a major economic expenditure in polymer flooding projects and will in most instances influence the decision making in relation to polymer flood implementation [5]. The synthetic polymer partially hydrolyzed polyacrylamide (HPAM) has been extensively used for polymer flood projects due to its low production costs and beneficial rheological properties [3], and is the only polymer investigated in this thesis. The rheological properties of HPAM in porous media have been investigated extensively, where mechanical degradation has been established as very probable when being subjected to the high shear rates experienced in an injection well [6]. Most of the research on HPAM in porous media have been carried out in linear core plugs, where the results from these studies have been considered transferable to flow in radial geometries. Recent research however, suggest that polymer flow is significantly different in linear versus radial models [7]. HPAM injectivity in porous media may therefore be underestimated based on linear core studies. The principal aim of this thesis is to investigate effects of residual oil on polymer injectivity in radial models. In addition, the relationship between polymer concentration and rheological behavior in presence of residual oil will be assessed and compared to conditions in absence residual oil. In this thesis, a polymer flood experiment conducted in a radial disc saturated with residual oil will be history matched. These results will subsequently be compared to previously history matched results from experimental conditions in absence of residual oil. Three water floods and two polymer floods was history matched, whereas two different polymer concentrations (800 and 2000 ppm) in the semi-dilute regime were investigated. A sequential order of alternating water and polymer <b>floods</b> enabled a <b>permeability</b> estimation both prior and post polymer flooding. History match results were obtained using two different simulator tools: STARS and MRST, respectively. Results from both simulator tools was consistent and thus will increase the confidence of obtained results. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to investigate the effect of different parameters on the STARS simulation tool. Several simulation model parameters such as grid block length and maximum timestep was investigated. In addition, polymer and fluid flow properties were assessed, which include: Molecular weight, viscosity, adsorption, adsorption reversibility, inaccessible pore volume, concentration, residual resistance factor and endpoint relative permeability. Current literature suggests that if porous media is first contacted with a low concentration HPAM solution that satisfies retention, no significant additional retention occurs when exposed to higher concentrations. In contrast, permeability determination both before and after polymer flooding revealed that additional retention occurred when the porous media was exposed to a higher concentration solution. In agreement with previously reported retention results in presence versus absence of residual oil, the amount of retention in presence of residual oil was reduced. However, this reduction was far greater than previous literature suggests. Both polymer concentrations exhibited strong shear thinning and shear thickening behavior in presence of residual oil. The highest polymer concentration was mechanically degraded during porous media propagation and the shear thinning behavior was inconsistent with previous literature. An effect of concentration on HPAM rheology was to shift the onset of shear thickening towards higher values with increasing polymer concentrations. This occurrence is not in agreement with previously obtained results. A comparison of bulk and in-situ viscosity of the highest concentration polymer was performed. Results revealed that in-situ viscosity was below bulk viscosity in the lower shear rate region. This is inconsistent with previously reported literature in the semi-dilute regime. An increase in HPAM concentration resulted in reduced injectivity values. However, this reduction was expected based on polymer rheology and presence of residual oil did not amplify the effect of concentration on injectivity. Simulation results showed that even though the absolute viscosity values of HPAM was severely reduced in presence of residual oil, the permeability decrease experienced during two-phase flow dominated. Thus, the overall effect of residual oil was to reduce injectivity of HPAM when varying flow conditions of the two experiments was not taken into consideration. However, since the isolated effect of residual oil on polymer injectivity was of primary concern in this thesis, injectivity in both absence and presence of residual oil was scaled according to corresponding brine injectivities, thus excluding experimental condition effects. The isolated effect of residual oil was to increase injectivity of HPAM significantly. Based on results obtained in this thesis, it may seem that injectivity estimation based on results from core floods in absence of residual oil may underestimate polymer injectivity...|$|R
