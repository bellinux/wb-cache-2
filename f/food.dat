5|$|A {{small number}} of {{productive}} species including carp, salmon, tilapia and catfish are farmed commercially, producing {{millions of tons of}} protein-rich <b>food</b> per year.

5|$|An embargo is not {{the same}} as <b>Food</b> Power, however, <b>food</b> power can be used in an embargo. In fact, embargoes that do not involve <b>food</b> in their list of {{restricted}} items often fail. For example, on August 20, 1914 the Allied Powers began an embargo on important items that were normally shipped to Germany. However, the embargo was not complete nor effective until <b>food</b> was added to the list of restricted materials. <b>Food</b> has the real power. After <b>food</b> was introduced the blockade began to strangle Germany's economy because they were dependent on imports for <b>food.</b> Because the Allied Powers used the power of <b>food</b> in their embargo, Germany was forced to resort to desperate measures and eventually failed despite them.|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the current levels of nitrates in baby <b>foods</b> marketed in Lisbon, Portugal to estimate the toxicological risk associated with their intake. The nitrate content was determined in bottled baby <b>foods</b> of four varieties: vegetable-based <b>foods,</b> meat-based <b>foods,</b> fish-based <b>foods,</b> and fruit-based <b>foods.</b> A total of 39 samples were analyzed over the period 2010 – 2011. Average and median levels of nitrate in baby <b>foods</b> were lower than the maximum limits established by European Union legislation (200  mg kg− 1). Median nitrate values in baby <b>foods</b> were 61, 30, 39, and 15  mg kg− 1 w/w for vegetable-based baby <b>foods,</b> meat-based baby <b>foods,</b> fish-based baby <b>foods,</b> and fruit-based baby <b>foods,</b> respectively.

5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in <b>food</b> selection for the grey jay, which selects <b>food</b> {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred <b>food</b> item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug <b>food</b> apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their <b>food.</b> Grey jays commonly carry large <b>food</b> items to nearby trees to eat or process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves {{to the site of}} dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their <b>food</b> and remember the locations of each other's <b>food</b> caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a <b>food</b> source to find better hiding places for <b>food.</b> They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the <b>food,</b> presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the diet of the American black duck consists of approximately 80% plant <b>food</b> and 20% animal <b>food.</b> The animal <b>food</b> diet increases to 85% during winter.

5|$|<b>Food</b> Circus: The <b>Food</b> Circus was a <b>food</b> {{court in}} the former armory, later named the Center House, and {{recently}} renamed The Armory (2012) as a remodel of the building continues. Unlike the current arrangement with a stage and a large open space for dancing, events, and temporary booths, many <b>food</b> booths {{were in the middle}} of the room as well as at the edges. There were 52concessionaires in all, nine of them with exhibits in addition to their <b>food</b> for sale. Beginning in 1963, the <b>Food</b> Circus also housed a variety of museums, including Jones' Fantastic Show, the Jules Charbneau World of Miniatures, and the Pullen Klondike Museum.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> is {{ingested}} {{through the}} mouth and when swallowed passes first into the pharynx {{and then into the}} esophagus. The esophagus is thus one of the first components of the digestive system and the gastrointestinal tract. After <b>food</b> passes through the esophagus, it enters the stomach. When <b>food</b> is being swallowed, the epiglottis moves backward to cover the larynx, preventing <b>food</b> from entering the trachea. At the same time, the upper esophageal sphincter relaxes, allowing a bolus of <b>food</b> to enter. Peristaltic contractions of the esophageal muscle push the <b>food</b> down the esophagus. These rhythmic contractions occur both as a reflex response to <b>food</b> that is in the mouth, and also {{as a response to the}} sensation of <b>food</b> within the esophagus itself. Along with peristalsis, the lower esophageal sphincter relaxes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> {{items include}} snails, worms, small crustaceans, flies and beetles. The {{proportions}} of each prey species vary with season and locality. Amphipod larvae {{are important in}} Ireland and Scotland, crustaceans in Norway, and the mollusc Assiminea grayana in the Netherlands. Small fish are occasionally eaten, and in hard weather pipits may scavenge for other <b>food,</b> including human <b>food</b> litter. There is little competition from other species for <b>food,</b> since rocky beach specialists like the purple sandpiper take slightly larger <b>food</b> items, and may wade in deeper water. When <b>food</b> is abundant, meadow pipits may also feed on the shore, but are driven away by the Eurasian rock pipits when there is less prey available.|$|E

5|$|<b>Food</b> {{politics}} are the political {{aspects of the}} production, control, regulation, inspection and distribution of <b>food.</b> The politics can {{be affected by the}} ethical, cultural, medical and environmental disputes concerning proper farming, agricultural and retailing methods and regulations. <b>Food</b> power {{is an integral part of}} the politics of <b>food.</b>|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> {{politics}} in Africa {{differs from the}} cases in North America and Europe in {{that there is a}} case of small scale <b>food</b> power in Africa, particularly in Sudan. Some experts say that the cases of famine and <b>food</b> insecurity in Africa are due to inconsistent output of <b>food</b> production and the downward spiral of the interaction between population growth and environmental sustainability. But upon closer inspection, it is revealed that nature is not the only catalyst for Africa’s numerous <b>food</b> insecurity issues.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> {{power is}} an {{integral}} part of the politics of <b>food.</b> The idea of <b>food</b> power is used in embargoes, employment, and <b>food</b> politics. In order for a nation to utilize <b>food</b> power effectively, the nation must effectively apply and display scarcity, supply concentration, demand dispersion, and action independence. The four main nations that export enough agriculture to be able to exert <b>food</b> power are the United States, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. On the smaller scale, particularly in some African countries, <b>food</b> power has been used as a weapon by opposing sides in internal wars and conflicts against their own people.|$|E

5000|$|There is some {{confusion}} over {{the usage of}} the term surrounding the inclusion of certain <b>foods,</b> in particular animal <b>foods.</b> The modern usage of the term whole <b>foods</b> diet is now widely synonymous with [...] "whole <b>foods</b> plant based diet" [...] with animal products, oil and salt no longer constituting whole <b>foods.</b>|$|R
5|$|<b>Food</b> {{security}} and <b>food</b> power {{are not the}} same thing. However, they are often directly related. <b>Food</b> security is when all people of a region at all times have enough <b>food</b> for an active, healthy life. <b>Food</b> power is related when a government, company, leader, country etc. takes this security away in order to get something in return. Many countries employ the exploit of <b>food</b> power to threaten another country's <b>food</b> security. A country's welfare correlates directly with the welfare of its people therefore each country wants to have an appropriate supply of <b>food</b> for its citizens. This want, however, can easily be used as leverage in the politics of <b>food,</b> demonstrating <b>food</b> power.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> stamps {{have been}} issued in the United States since World War II, but the program did not include Puerto Rico until the early 1970s, when U.S. Public Laws 91-671 of January 11, 1971 and 93-86 of November 1, 1974 {{partially}} extended the <b>Food</b> Stamp Program to U.S. territories. The <b>Food</b> Stamp program was later expanded to provide full coverage and benefits to Puerto Rico and other territories under Section 19 of the <b>Food</b> Stamp Act of 1977.|$|E
5|$|<b>Food</b> {{waste is}} {{generally}} considered to have a damaging effect on the environment; a reduction in <b>food</b> waste is considered critical if the UK is to meet obligations under the European Landfill Directive to reduce biodegradable waste going to landfill and favourable considering international targets on climate change, limiting greenhouse gas emissions. When disposed of in landfill, <b>food</b> waste releases methane, a relatively damaging greenhouse gas, and leachate, a toxin capable of considerable groundwater pollution. The <b>food</b> supply chain accounts for a fifth of UK carbon emissions; the production, storage and transportation of <b>food</b> to homes requires large amounts of energy. The effects of stopping <b>food</b> waste that can potentially be prevented has been likened to removing one in five cars from UK roads.|$|E

5|$|<b>Food</b> waste puts a large {{burden on}} the {{finances}} of each household and local councils in the UK; wasted <b>food</b> is estimated to cost each British household £250–£400 per year, accumulating to £15,000–£24,000 over a lifetime. This comes from the total purchasing cost of the <b>food</b> against what is thrown away uneaten. Additionally, households pay for the collection and disposal of <b>food</b> waste by their local council {{in the form of}} council tax. For councils, the cost of <b>food</b> waste comes from its collection and disposal {{as a part of the}} waste stream; this is especially an issue for councils that run separate <b>food</b> waste collections.|$|E
