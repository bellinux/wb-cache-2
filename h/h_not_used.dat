40|$|Abstract— 802. 11 {{wireless}} {{local area}} networks {{are now a}} common feature in the home. In {{order to meet the}} quality of service (QoS) demands for the increasing number of multimedia applications on these home networks the 802. 11 e amendment was developed. A suitable video coding standard for these multimedia applications is H. 264 due to its high compression and error resilience. In this paper we investigate how the quality of H. 264 video is affected as the number of concurrent video streams sent over a multi-rate 802. 11 e network is increased. Several packet mapping schemes are compared. We show that the mapping schemes which differentiate video packets based on their frame type are more successful at maintaining acceptable video quality when congestion occurs, providing a more gradual quality degradation as congestion increases rather than the cliffedge quality drop that tends to occur with the other mapping schemes. These differentiated schemes are more successful for videos that do not have a high amount of temporal activity. We also identify that impairments caused by congestion tend to occur towards the bottom of each frame when the flexible macroblock ordering (FMO) feature of <b>H.</b> 264 is <b>not</b> <b>used</b> but the use of FMO can reduce this effect.

On the September 5 episode of Raw, Truth and Miz challenged Air Boom (Evan Bourne and Kofi Kingston) to a match for the Tag Team Championship at Night of Champions, but were disqualified after Miz assaulted a referee during the match. R-Truth and Miz were subsequently fired by Triple H the following night on Raw. At Hell in a Cell, R-Truth and Miz attacked Alberto Del Rio, CM Punk, John Cena, and several others after the WWE Championship match ended. After this, the entire WWE roster came out to find a way into the cell before the officials were able to get the door open and arrest them. On the October 10 episode of Raw, R-Truth and The Miz were reinstated by John Laurinaitis. At Vengeance, Miz and Truth defeated CM Punk and Triple H in a tag match, due to interference from Kevin Nash. Later that same night they assaulted John Cena during his WWE Championship match with Alberto Del Rio. On the October 24 episode of Raw, Awesome Truth attacked John Cena and Zack Ryder. On the 7 November episode of Raw, Miz and R-Truth defeated Cena and Ryder. On November 20 at Survivor Series, R-Truth and The Miz were defeated by Cena and The Rock. The following night on Raw, Cena instigated an argument between R-Truth and Miz, which ultimately led to the team's dissolution as Miz attacked R-Truth with a Skull Crushing Finale onto the stage. Following the event, WWE announced that they had suspended Killings for 30 days for his first violation of the Wellness Policy.|$|R

We have conducted a randomised trial in consecutive patients with serious infections for whom an aminoglycoside seemed warranted. Exclusion criteria were neutropenia or severely impaired renal function. 123 patients were enrolled. For efficacy analysis only those patients were considered in whom treatment with the aminoglycoside was not stopped within 72 h (n = 67); toxicity was analysed on patients receiving aminoglycosides for more than 48 <b>h</b> and <b>not</b> <b>using</b> other nephrotoxic medication (n = 85). Gentamicin 4 mg/kg every day (OD) or gentamicin 1. 33 mg/kg three times daily (MD) (with dose-reduction in case of renal dysfunction) were given intravenously. In almost all patients intravenous amoxycillin 1 g every 6 h was also started. Baseline characteristics were comparable in both arms. A good clinical response was observed in 32 / 35 (91 %) of the OD and in 25 / 32 (78 %) in the MD group (difference 13 %, 95 % confidence interval - 6. 4 % to + 26. 9 %). 2 patients in each group died with uncontrolled infection. An insufficient bacteriological response (persistent positive cultures, resistance, or superinfection) was observed in 2 patients with OD and 3 patients with MD. In patients treated for more than 48 h duration of therapy and mean doses were 7. 0 days (1590 mg) and 7. 4 days (1672 mg) in OD and MD respectively. Mean first serum trough/peak levels were 0. 6 / 10. 2 mg/L and 1. 4 / 5. 2 mg/L. Nephrotoxicity (a rise in serum creatinine of 45 mumol/L or more) developed in 2 / 40 (5 %) in OD and 11 / 45 (24 %) in MD (p = 0. 016). Risk factors for nephrotoxicity were duration of therapy and baseline creatinine clearance rate.
