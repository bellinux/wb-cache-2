5|$|Norway is {{a country}} with {{abundance}} of hydroelectricity and NSB saw {{huge amounts of money}} burning up with the imported coal. Plans for electrification of the line is as old as the railway itself, and in 1912 the line from Nesttun to Bergen was proposed electrified and rebuilt to double track, having seen the Thamshavn Line open with <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> in 1908. During the planning of the Hardanger Line and the Flåm Line during the 30s the suggestion again arose, and both the branch lines were built with <b>electric</b> <b>traction,</b> but not the main line. Countersuggestions were raised proposing a conversion to the locomotives running on oil or coal dust. In 1939 a plan for national electrification was launched, and the Voss Line was top priority. But the breakout of World War II set the plans back, and not until the 50s was it again possible to afford such investments. Vossebanen took <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> into use on 2 July 1954.|$|E
5|$|Adelaide's first {{experiment}} with electric powered trams was a demonstration {{run on the}} Adelaide and Hindmarsh Tramway company's line. A battery powered tram fitted with Julien's Patent <b>Electric</b> <b>Traction</b> ran in 1889 to Henley Beach. The trial was unsuccessful due to the batteries poor capacity, and the promoters' deaths in a level crossing accident shortly after precluded further experiments.|$|E

50|$|The Twin City Railroad Company was {{organized}} in 1912 as {{successor to the}} Twin City Light and Traction Company and acquired its subsidiaries, the Chehalis <b>Electric</b> and <b>Traction</b> Company and the Centralia <b>Electric</b> and <b>Traction</b> Company. The company operated the 6.6 mile electric line extending from Chehalis, Washington (the “Rose City”) to Centralia, Washington (the “Hub City”) until 1936.|$|R
5|$|The first Zephyr (9900) was {{completed}} by the Budd Company on April 9, 1934, powered by an eight-cylinder, 600-horsepower (447kW), 8-201-A model Winton engine. Like the diesel-electric locomotives that soon displaced the steam locomotive on American railroads, this engine powered an electrical generator; the electricity it generated was then fed to <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> motors connected to the axles in the train's front truck.|$|E
5|$|Before its takeover, the DR {{had carried}} out some joint {{electrification}} experiments with the Metropolitan Railway (MR), the other sub-surface line {{with which the}} DR shared the Inner Circle. A section of track between Earl's Court and High Street Kensington was electrified with a four-rail system and a jointly owned test train operated a shuttle service between February and November 1900. Having proven the practicality of <b>electric</b> <b>traction,</b> the two companies set up a joint committee to select a supplier of equipment for the electrification of their networks.|$|E
5|$|From 21 November 1944, {{when the}} Flåm Line {{received}} <b>electric</b> <b>traction,</b> Class 64 trains {{were also used}} there. The Flåm Line is even steeper and more curved than the Hardanger Line, so the trains received track brakes. In 1947, El 9 locomotives were delivered for the Flåm Line. Class 64 trains continued to be used periodically on the Flåm Line when there was insufficient availability of El 9s, {{as well as in}} periods with very little or very much traffic.|$|E

The company got into financial difficulty and in turn became Lancashire United Tramways later Lancashire United Transport (LUT). LUT had headquarters and a large depot in Howe Bridge. On 16 December 1933, the last tram ran from Leigh to Four Lane Ends. The following day trolley buses took over.|$|E

5|$|It is {{reported}} that this {{problem with the}} CL contributed to the bankruptcy of the cable company in 1888. However, electric motor traction had been considered all along, and much engineering progress had been made since the tunnel's construction had begun in 1886. So, CL chairman Charles Grey Mott decided to switch to <b>electric</b> <b>traction.</b> Other cable-operated systems using the Hallidie patents continued to be designed, such as the Glasgow Subway which opened in 1896.|$|E
50|$|The 1270 {{class was}} devised by English Electric {{engineer}} Stan Lyons, {{based on the}} body design of North American road switcher but using the same engine and generator as the 1250 class. The first 12 units had the same English <b>Electric</b> 525 <b>traction</b> motors as the 1250 class. The remaining units had improved English <b>Electric</b> 548 <b>traction</b> motors with a slightly higher tractive effort. The final six units had dynamic brakes.|$|R

5|$|Perks {{was also}} a large {{shareholder}} in Yerkes' next target, the Metropolitan District Railway, usually known as the District Railway or DR. By March 1901, the syndicate had acquired a controlling interest in the DR and made a proposal for its electrification. Yerkes established the Metropolitan District <b>Electric</b> <b>Traction</b> Company (MDETC) on 15 July 1901 with himself as managing director. The company raised £1million (£ today) {{to carry out the}} electrification works including the construction of the generating station and supplying the new electric rolling stock. In September 1901, Perks became the DR's chairman.|$|E
5|$|The line beyond Harrow was not {{electrified}} so trains were hauled by {{an electric}} locomotive from Baker Street, changed for a steam locomotive en route. From 1 January 1907, the exchange {{took place at}} Wembley Park. From 19 July 1908, locomotives were changed at Harrow. GWR rush hour services to the city continued to operate, <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> taking over from steam at Paddington from January 1907, although freight services to Smithfield continued to be steam hauled throughout.|$|E
5|$|KSS {{decided to}} convert its lines to <b>{{electric}}</b> <b>traction</b> as well. The first electric trams ran on 29 September 1899, and the conversion {{was completed by}} 15 January 1900. At the time of electrification, KSS had 57 horsecars; 38 of these were later converted to trailers, while 19 were decommissioned. The John Stephenson and Skabo trailers were taken out of service in 1917–18, and sixteen of these were sold to the Bergen Tramway and Trondheim Tramway—the latter rebuilding them to meter gauge. One of the original Stephenson cars has been preserved at the Oslo Tramway Museum.|$|E

5|$|The District {{found an}} {{investor}} {{to finance the}} upgrade in 1901, American Charles Yerkes. On 15 July 1901, Yerkes established the Metropolitan District <b>Electric</b> <b>Traction</b> Company with himself as managing director and raised £1million {{to carry out the}} electrification, including construction of the generating station and supplying the new rolling stock. Yerkes soon had control of the District Railway and his experiences in the United States led him to favour DC with a track level conductor rail similar to that in use on the City & South London Railway and Central London Railway. After arbitration by the Board of Trade, the DC system was adopted.|$|E
5|$|The {{line from}} Sandvika to Oslo was {{substantially}} upgraded between 1917 and 1922. From 27 February 1917 a passing loop was built at Lysaker and standard gauge traffic {{was carried out}} on the northern track. A southern track was then built, which was used by narrow gauge trains. However, both were dual gauge. All–standard gauge operations commenced on 9 February 1920, although the dual gauge was not removed until 1922. <b>Electric</b> <b>traction</b> started operation on 30 August 1922. An interlocking system was installed on 29 July 1924. From 1922 a half-hour headway was introduced on the local trains between Sandvika and Oslo West Station.|$|E
5|$|The {{line was}} built by the mining company Sydvaranger, who started {{construction}} in 1907 and inaugurated the railway in 1910. From 1912, the port network received electrification, as did the mainline in 1920. Originally, free passenger trains services were also offered. During the Second World War, the line was largely destroyed, but rebuilt afterwards and re-opened in 1952. <b>Electric</b> <b>traction</b> was abandoned in 1955 when two EMD G12 diesel locomotives were bought. The line closed in 1997, but was reopened in 2009, following a change in ownership of the mine. There are proposals to connect the line to either {{one or both of}} the Finnish and Russian railway networks.|$|E

5|$|Today's DeKalb County Courthouse is {{the third}} {{in a line of}} {{structures}} to carry that name. In 1839 a log structure was built and called the county courthouse; the log building stood {{across the street from the}} current courthouse. Ten years later, in 1850, the second DeKalb County Courthouse was erected. From December 13, 1902 until April 17, 1924, DeKalb-Sycamore <b>Electric</b> <b>Traction</b> Company operated a trolley route between the two cities (DeKalb and Sycamore), which ended at the DeKalb County Courthouse. The current courthouse, which sits on the same site as the 1850 building, was erected in 1905.|$|E
5|$|Construction of {{the line}} started in 1924, with the line opening in 1940. It allowed the {{district}} of Sogn access to Bergen and Oslo via the Bergen Line. <b>Electric</b> <b>traction</b> was taken into use in 1944; at first El 9 locomotives were used, and from 1982 El 11. Until 1991, the train connected with a ferry service from Flåm to Gudvangen. In 1992, freight services were terminated, and due to low ticket prices and high operating costs, the line was nearly closed. In 1998, Flåm Utvikling took over marketing and ticket sale for the line, prices were heavily increased and El 17 locomotives were introduced. The trains remain operated by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB), while the line itself is {{owned and operated by}} the Norwegian National Rail Administration.|$|E
5|$|In November 1891, notice {{was given}} {{of a private}} bill that would be {{presented}} to Parliament {{for the construction of}} the BS The railway was planned to run entirely underground from the junction of New Street (now Melcombe Street) and Dorset Square west of Baker Street to James Street (now Spur Road) {{on the south side of}} Waterloo station. From Baker Street, the route was to run eastwards beneath Marylebone Road, then curve to the south under Park Crescent and follow Portland Place, Langham Place and Regent Street to Piccadilly Circus. It was then to run under Haymarket, Trafalgar Square and Northumberland Avenue before passing under the River Thames to Waterloo station. A decision had not been made between the use of cable haulage or <b>electric</b> <b>traction</b> as the means of pulling the trains.|$|E
