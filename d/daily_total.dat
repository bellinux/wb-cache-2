5|$|The 1977 Oman cyclone was {{the deadliest}} {{tropical}} cyclone on record to strike Oman. The storm formed off {{the west coast}} of India in the Arabian Sea, and curved westward to reach peak winds of 110km/h (70mph). The storm struck Masirah Island and later southern Oman on June13, before dissipating the next day over Saudi Arabia. Producing wind gusts to 230km/h (140mph), the storm was the strongest cyclone on record to hit the Arabian Peninsula until Cyclone Gonu hit in 2007. About 95% of Marisah Island was damaged by the strong winds, including much of the military base. The cyclone dropped 430.6mm (16.95in) of rainfall over a 24period on Marisah, which was the highest <b>daily</b> <b>total</b> in the country as of 2003. Overall, the storm killed at least 105people and left 50,000 homeless.|$|E

Turning eastward, the storm dropped torrential rainfall in eastern Texas and western Louisiana, peaking at [...] in Logansport, Louisiana. Several stations reported record rainfall, including Shreveport, Louisiana where its 24‑hour amount remained the highest <b>daily</b> <b>total</b> as of 2008. High rains left about $1.5million in crop damage between two Texas counties. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, forcing evacuations and road closures.|$|E
500|$|Massachusetts Governor Christian Herter also {{issued a}} state of emergency, due to the {{widespread}} flooding damage. As a result, the state's National Guard and the Army Corps assisted in cleanup, and most roads took three weeks to clear. Residents in areas affected by Diane's flooding were advised to boil water and not to use gas cooking equipment. Diane's historic rainfall resulted in the wettest month on record in Boston {{with a total of}} , a record that stands as of 2010; Boston's 24‑hour total of [...] remained the highest <b>daily</b> <b>total</b> as of 1996. Following Diane's floods, cities in Massachusetts enlarged culverts and improved draining systems, as well as constructing weirs; these systems helped mitigate against future flooding.|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of circulation upon the atmospheric precipitation in Poland {{as an example}} of Central European climatic conditions is analysed. The study is based on daily sums of precipitation which have been collected from over 50 meteorological stations for the period of 1951 - 1999 as well as on Großwetterlagen circulation patterns. The analysis confirms the considerable {{influence of}} atmospheric circulation upon precipitation totals and especially upon their extreme values. The highest rainfalls occur during situations with N-NE-E air flow. During these circulation types and cyclonic troughs or with the cyclonic centre over Central Europe the highest probability of high <b>daily</b> <b>totals</b> is usually observed. However, heavy rainfalls in summer can also occur during other situations even including those with high pressure. Obviously these circulation patterns also have the highest chance for days without any precipitation as well as the lowest mean <b>daily</b> <b>totals.</b> A climatological analysis of the seasonal and annual precipitation totals associated with circulation indices confirmed relatively close connections between these variables...|$|R
500|$|On coming ashore, Cyclona Lua {{produced}} strong winds, gusting to [...] at Port Hedland, and appreciable rainfall, peaking at [...] at Bidyadanga. The precipitation was widespread, affecting a {{large area}} of interior Western Australia. The overcast weather led to abnormally cool temperatures, which broke monthly records in portions of the central and eastern Pilbara. For instance, the Port Hedland Airport recorded a maximum temperature of 24.1°C on 17 March, the coldest March day in the station's history; the previous record of 25.8°C was set 64 years prior. As the remnants of Lua continued poleward, they continued to drop heavy rainfall, including a <b>daily</b> <b>total</b> (19 March) of [...] at Edjudina, setting {{the record for the}} wettest March day there. A barometer reading of [...] at Rowley Shoals represented the lowest observed pressure associated with the storm.|$|E

The province experienced river flooding due to the heavy rains; the Dazhang Stream crested at [...] in Yongtai County, which was above [...] "danger" [...] flood levels. Damage in the province totaled $131million (¥1.085billion yuan). There were 19deaths in Fujian. Significant flooding from Kammuri occurred inland, related to the storm's remnants' merging with a cold front. Rainfall reached [...] at a station in Jiangxi Province. In Hunan Province, the storms destroyed 12,400houses, leaving over 10,000people homeless. Also in the province, 14reservoirs surpassed their capacity.

40|$|Objective: To {{describe}} the <b>total</b> and domain-specific <b>daily</b> sitting time among {{a sample of}} Australian office-based employees. Methods: In April 2010, paper-based surveys were provided to desk-based employees (n= 801) in Victoria, Australia. <b>Total</b> <b>daily</b> and domain-specific (work, leisure-time and transport-related) sitting time (minutes/day) were assessed by validated questionnaires. Differences in sitting time were examined across socio-demographic (age, sex, occupational status) and lifestyle characteristics (physical activity levels, body mass index [BMI]) using multiple linear regression analyses. Results: The median (95 % confidence interval [CI]) of <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> sitting time was 540 (531 - 557) minutes/day. Insufficiently active adults (median= 578 minutes/day, [95 %CI: 564 - 602]), younger adults aged 18 - 29 years (median= 561 minutes/day, [95 %CI: 540 - 577]) reported the highest <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> sitting times. Occupational sitting time accounted for almost 60 % of <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> sitting time. In multivariate analyses, <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> sitting time was negatively associated with age (unstandardised regression coefficient [B]=- 1. 58, p< 0. 001) and overall physical activity (minutes/week) (B=- 0. 03, p< 0. 001) and positively associated with BMI (B= 1. 53, p= 0. 038). Conclusions: Desk-based employees reported {{that more than half}} of their <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> sitting time was accrued in the work setting. Implications: Given the high contribution of occupational sitting to <b>total</b> <b>daily</b> sitting time among desk-based employees, interventions should focus on the work setting...|$|R

Only {{a small portion of the}} island near Saint-Pierre received less than 1m (3.3ft) of rainfall, and totals increased further inland, with over 2m (6.6ft) recorded at four locations. Such heavy rainfall typically occurs on the island when tropical cyclones approach, owing to orographic enhancement in the mountainous interior.|$|E
