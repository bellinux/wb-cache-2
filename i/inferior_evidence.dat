40|$|AbstractDisplacement of {{a visual}} target during a saccadic eye {{movement}} is normally detected {{only at a}} high threshold, implying that high-quality information about target position is not stored in the nervous system across the saccade. We show that blanking the target for 50 – 300 msec after a saccade restores sensitivity to the displacement. With blanking, subjects reliably detect displacements as small as 0. 33 deg across 6 deg eye movements, with correspondingly steep psychophysical functions. Performance with blanking in a fixation control is <b>inferior,</b> <b>evidence</b> for a saccadic enhancement of sensitivity to image displacement. If blanking is delayed so that the target is visible immediately after the saccade in its displaced position, performance declines to non-blanking levels. Blanking the target before the saccade, and restoring it during the saccade, yields a similar but weaker effect. We interpret these results with a model in which the visual system searches for the postsaccadic goal target within a restricted spatiotemporal window. If it is not found, the assumption of stationarity {{of the world is}} broken and the system makes use of other information such as extraretinal signals for calibrating location...|$|E

40|$|Argumentation {{textbooks}} typically {{dismiss the}} anecdote as an <b>inferior</b> type of <b>evidence.</b> We {{argue that it}} deserves more serious attention because it serves three important purposes: (1) Anecdotes function as synecdoches capable of revealing insights unobtainable through statistical norms.

Anecdotes, then, coordinate evidentiary, representational, narrative and ethotic elements of argumentation and are not always trivial...|$|R
40|$|Evidence-based {{medicine}} (EBM) {{makes use}} of explicit procedures for grading evidence for causal claims. Normally, these procedures categorise evidence of correlation produced by statistical trials as better evidence for a causal claim than evidence of mechanisms produced by other methods.

In this paper we first set out the case for treating evidence of mechanisms alongside evidence of correlation in explicit protocols for evaluating evidence. Next we provide case studies which exemplify the ways in which evidence of mechanisms complements evidence of correlation in practice. Finally, we put forward some general considerations as to how the two sorts of evidence can be more closely integrated by EBM...|$|R

40|$|Simultaneous {{intracellular}} {{recordings of}} nearby neocortical neurons {{have demonstrated that}} their membrane potentials are highly correlated. The correlation between the spiking activity of nearby neocortical neurons may be much smaller, suggesting that inputs are more similar than outputs. Much less {{is known about the}} similarity of inputs in subcortical sensory areas. Here we investigate this question by making simultaneous whole-cell recordings from neighbouring neurons in the dorsal cortex of the mouse <b>inferior</b> colliculus. No <b>evidence</b> for monosynaptic connections between neighbouring cells was observed, suggesting that integration of afferent signals plays a more important role than local processing. The correlation between frequency response areas of neighbouring cells varied but, surprisingly, neighbouring cells were on average not more similar in their responses to tones than non-neighbouring neurons. This large micro-heterogeneity suggests a sparse representation of acoustic features within the dorsal cortex. © 2011 The Authors. Journal compilatio...|$|R
60|$|In {{the laws}} of number, then, and in those of space, we {{recognize}} in the most unqualified manner, the rigorous universality {{of which we are}} in quest. Those laws have been in all ages the type of certainty, the standard of comparison for all <b>inferior</b> degrees of <b>evidence.</b> Their invariability is so perfect, that it renders us unable even to conceive any exception to them; and philosophers have been led, though (as I have endeavored to show) erroneously, to consider their evidence as lying not in experience, but in the original constitution of the intellect. If, therefore, from {{the laws of}} space and number, we were able to deduce uniformities of any other description, this would be conclusive evidence to us that those other uniformities possessed the same rigorous certainty. But this we can not do. From laws of space and number alone, nothing can be deduced but laws of space and number.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To dispel {{prevalent}} myths surrounding {{diagnosis of}} dermonecrotic and associated conditions supposedly resulting from bites of brown recluse, hobo, or other spiders in Canada. SOURCES OF INFORMATION: Worldwide, spider bites are regularly misdiagnosed as the etiologic agents in human dermonecrosis mainly {{as a result}} of inaccurate, erroneous, or hyperbolic popular and professional literature based on inference, circumstantial <b>evidence,</b> <b>inferior</b> clinical trials, and misunderstanding of the facts regarding spider-bite envenomation. MAIN MESSAGE: A working diagnosis of "spider bite" or publishing a case history should be considered only when a spider is caught in the act of biting or otherwise reliably associated with a lesion. Accurate identification of the spider could be critical for correct diagnosis and subsequent treatment. CONCLUSION: Brown recluse spiders are not found in Canada. Hobo spiders have not been reliably implicated in dermonecrosis. Worldwide, spider-bite envenomation is an unlikely cause of dermonecrosis.

40|$|Neurons in {{the medial}} {{superior}} olive encode interaural temporal disparity, and their receptive fields indicate {{the location of}} a sound source in the azimuthal plane. It is often assumed that the projections of these neurons transmit the receptive field information about azimuth from point to point, much like the projections of the retina to the brain transmit the position of a visual stimulus. Yet this assumption has never been verified. Here, we use physiological and anatomical methods to examine the projections of the medial superior olive to the <b>inferior</b> colliculus for <b>evidence</b> of a spatial topography that would support transmission of azimuthal receptive fields. The results show that this projection does not follow a simple point-to-point topographical map of receptive field location. Thus, the representation of sound location along the azimuth in the inferior colliculus most likely relies on a complex, nonlinear map.

5000|$|Education - It {{has been}} {{claimed that the}} {{education}} system for residential schools operated {{under the assumption that}} aboriginals were intellectually and culturally <b>inferior,</b> but documented <b>evidence</b> suggests otherwise. Prior to the establishment of the IRS system, a good number of Aboriginals had already received a non-aboriginal education in earlier mission schools. However, because of limited funds, a shortage of trained teachers, and an emphasis on manual labour, a good many students in the IRS system did not progress beyond a rudimentary education. When residential schools were phased out, Aboriginal youth enrolled in provincial schools dropped out in large numbers. The calls to action are to address the current school completion rates and the income gap between the aboriginals and non-aboriginals. In addition, the calls to actions request to eliminate the discrepancy in funding of schools on and off reserves, where children have had to leave their families behind to pursue high-school education or further education.|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Herbal {{medicine}} (phytotherapy) {{is widely}} used, {{but the evidence}} for its effectiveness {{is a matter of}} ongoing debate. We compared the quality and results of trials of Western phytotherapy and conventional medicine. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A random sample of placebo-controlled trials of Western phytotherapy was identified in a comprehensive literature search (19 electronic databases). Conventional medicine trials matched for condition and type of outcome were selected from the Cochrane Central Controlled Trials Register (issue 1, 2003). Data were extracted in duplicate. Trials described as double-blind, with adequate generation of allocation sequence and adequate concealment of allocation were assumed to be of higher methodological quality. RESULTS: Eighty-nine herbal medicine and 89 matched conventional medicine trials were analyzed. Studies of Western herbalism were smaller, less likely to be published in English, and less likely to be indexed in MEDLINE than their counterparts from conventional medicine. Nineteen (21 %) herbal and four (5 %) conventional medicine trials were of higher quality. In both groups, smaller trials showed more beneficial treatment effects than larger trials. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings challenge the widely held belief that the quality of the evidence on the effectiveness of herbal medicine is generally <b>inferior</b> to the <b>evidence</b> available for conventional medicine...|$|R

40|$|Mobility is {{important}} to successfulrehabilitation after a stroke,which makes restoration of gait a priority. Three months after a stroke, approximately 20 % of stroke survivors remain primary wheelchair users, while walking is limited in some manner in anoth-er 60 %. 1, 2 The purpose of this review {{is to examine the}} efficacy of a variety of gait retraining techniques currently in clinical use, including strength training, functional electrical stimulation, treadmill training, partial body-weight support, EMG biofeed-back, and splinting of the lower extremity. Method The literature search strategy and the assessment of trial quality, using the PEDro scoring system, have been previously described in an earlier issue (Topics in Stroke Rehabilitation 10 : 1). Studies that scored 9 – 10 on the PEDro Scale were con-sidered methodologically to be of “excel-lent ” quality. Studies with scores ranging from 6 – 8 were considered to be of “good” quality, while studies scoring between 4 – 5 were considered to be of “fair ” quality. Studies that scored below 4 were felt to be of “poor ” quality. We arrived at these descriptive terms of quality assessment arbitrarily in an effort to simplify the inter-pretation of results. Studies that used a non-experimental or uncontrolled design were given a “no score ” designation and were considered an <b>inferior</b> form of <b>evidence.</b> They were used to formulate conclusion...|$|R
40|$|Aim To {{evaluate}} {{the evidence on}} {{the formation of a}} hard tissue barrier after pulp capping in humans. Methodology A PubMed and CENTRAL literature search with specific indexing terms and a hand search were made. The authors assessed the level of evidence of each publication as high, moderate or low. Based on this, the evidence grade of the conclusions was rated as strong, moderately strong, limited or insufficient. Results The initial search process resulted in a total of 171 publications. After reading the abstracts and hand searching the reference lists of the retrieved publications, 107 studies were retrieved in full-text and interpreted. After the interpretation, 21 studies remained and were included in the systematic review and given a level of evidence. No study had a high level of evidence, one study had moderate and 20 studies had a low level of evidence. There was heterogeneity between the studies; therefore, no meta-analysis was performed. The majority of studies on pulp capping using calcium hydroxide based materials reported formation of hard tissue bridging, studies on other pulp capping materials such as bonding agents presented <b>inferior</b> results. The <b>evidence</b> grade was insufficient. Conclusions Insufficient evidence grade does not necessarily imply that there is no effect of a pulp capping procedure or that it should not be used. Rather, the insufficient evidence underpins the need for high-quality studies...|$|R
40|$|Up to 80 % of Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (CLL) harbour clonal {{chromosome}} aberrations having important clinical implications (i. e. 13 q deletion, + 12, 11 q/ATM and 17 p/TP 53 deletions). 14 q 32 /IGH rearrangements {{were recently}} found in 6 - 19 % of CLL patients and {{were associated with}} therapy-demanding disease and <b>inferior</b> outcome. Whereas <b>evidence</b> was provided {{that some of the}} classical aberrations, such as 11 q-, 17 p-, may appear late in CLL clinical history, no information is presently available concerning 14 q 32 /IGH translocations. The aim of this study was i) to analyze the incidence of 14 q 32 /IGH translocations occurring at clonal evolution in CLL, ii) to analyze the clinicobiologic significance of late-appearing 14 q 32 /IGH translocations. One hundred-five CLL cases seen at our institution in a 10 -year period were submitted to FISH analysis at diagnosis or before 1 st line treatment as part of routine diagnostic workup. In 47 patients with indolent disease (untreated or treated with 1 line without relapse, group 1) FISH analysis was repeated after 48 - 96 months (median 72). In 58 relapsed patients who started 2 nd line treatment (group 2), FISH was performed sequentially before administration of the 2 nd line and before each subsequent line of therapy. These 105 patients fulfilled the following criteria: a) diagnosis of bona fide CLL based on morphology and immunophenotyping (CD 5 /CD 19 +, CD 23 + as minimal requirement), b) clinical records available for review, c) successful FISH analysis at diagnosis and during follow-up. Those cases with t(11; 14) (q 13;q 32) /CCND 1 -IGH or other 14 q 32 /IGH translocations present at diagnosis were excluded from this study. Sequential FISH studies were performed in all patients on peripheral blood (PB) samples using commercially available probes for the identification of deletions at 13 q 14, 11 q 22 /ATM, 17 p 13 /TP 53, of trisomy 12 and of 14 q 32 /IGH translocations. In 10 patients bone marrow (BM) aspiration and/or lymph node (LN) biopsy were studied by FISH as well. The patients were treated at disease progression as defined by NCI criteria. Refractory disease was defined by stable disease or progressive disease during treatment or disease progression within 6 months of from antileukemic treatment using fludarabine alone or in combination with other agents. Time to chemorefractoriness was measured from date of first line treatment to date of refractoriness to fludarabine containing regimen or date of last follow-up. Overall survival was measured from diagnosis to date of last follow-up or death and from initiation of first line treatment to the date of death or last follow-up. At diagnosis 39 % of the cases had 13 q-, 14 % had + 12, 7 % had 11 q- and 3 % had 17 p-. A late-appearing 14 q 32 /IGH rearrangement was not detected among 47 patients in group 1, whereas 7 / 58 cases (12, 1 %) in group 2 showed a 14 q 32 /IGH break in 16 - 25 % of the cells. These 7 patients had the following aberrations at diagnosis: 13 q- and 11 q- in 1 case, 13 q- in 2 cases; 11 q- in 1 case, + 12 in 2 cases, no aberrations 1 case. The 14 q 32 translocation appeared after a median time of 64 months (range 51 - 91). It was associated with the appearance of 17 p- in 3 / 7 cases with one of these presenting also biallelic del 13 q. In two cases paired BM or LN sample and PB samples were available for FISH studies and the appearance of IgH translocation in the BM or in the LN sample preceded its appearance in PB by 13 - 58 months. All 7 cases with late appearing 14 q 32 /IGH translocation developed chemorefractoriness to fludarabine regimen with a median TTC of 27 months (range 12 - 40 months), as compared with a TTC of 67 months (range 1 - 143 months) in 51 treated patients who did not develop the 14 q 32 translocation (p= 0. 0002). Overall survival did not differ significantly either when measured from diagnosis or from 1 st line treatment in 7 patients with 14 q 32 translocation as compared with the appropriate control. We arrived at the following conclusions: i) a late-appearing 14 q 32 /IGH translocation occurred at a relatively high incidence (12, 1 %) in patients with relapsing disease and not in patients with stable disease, ii) this aberration involved a minority of cells and, in approximately half of the cases, it was associated with other aberrations, reflecting complex clonal evolution, iii) in 2 assessable cases it first appeared first in the BM or LN; iv) the appearance of 14 q 32 /IGH translocation was associated with shorter TTC...|$|R
