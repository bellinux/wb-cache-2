40|$|As {{a part of}} the Cal Poly Mechanical Engineering curriculum, all {{students}} must take part in a three quarter long senior design project. Students are presented with existing problems, select a project, and then apply the knowledge they have gained throughout their academic career to design and build a solution. The intent behind this project is to create an experience that is similar to an engineering project in industry, by applying engineering and teamwork skills to solve a problem. Team Trikeceratops’ mission was to develop an adaptive adjustable tricycle {{to be used in the}} Special Education Department of the Buena Park School District for recreational use and physical therapy. The design team was comprised of four Cal Poly mechanical engineering students and a kinesiology student-consultant who worked through three primary design phases over the course of nine months to develop a functional prototype. These phases included ideation and conception, detailed design, and manufacturing, all of which have different requirements that call for a variety of skill sets. During ideation and conception, Team Trikeceratops developed lists of requirements from sponsor input, divided the project into components, generated ideas, and refined the options to reach an overall conceptual design. This initial phase was also essential in developing a team mentality and establishing the basic rules and guidelines by which the team would operate. At the end of ideation and conception, the team had developed a full theoretical design that would meet the customer requirements. Detailed design was the second phase wherein the students took the conceptual design and applied engineering knowledge to clearly define the solution. In this phase, most of the more stereotypical engineering occurred. Students sized tubing for the frame, performed calculations and analysis on components, created manufacturing drawings, <b>identified</b> <b>part</b> <b>numbers</b> for acquisition, and began contacting companies for parts and services. At the end of detailed design, the team had a bill of materials, manufacturing plan, contact information for suppliers, and fully dimensioned drawings for manufacturing custom parts. The third phase of product development was manufacturing and testing. Students cut, notched, welded, and machined various custom components while simultaneously overcoming problems of improper sizing and extended lead times on ordered materials. Following this process, the students tested the tricycle to ensure that it met the customer requirements set forth in the Design Verification Plan and Report (DVPR). At the end of this phase a functioning prototype was completed and staged for delivery and the final report was compiled. This remainder of this report details Team Trikeceratops’ progress from initial concept generation to prototype realization and explores each part of the aforementioned engineering design process in depth...|$|R
40|$|The {{numbering}} {{and identification}} of parts within a manufacturing organization is of immense importance, for {{it serves as}} a major means of communicating information throughout the organization. The oldest, and still most prominent method of part identification is the use of meaningful, alpha/numeric <b>part</b> <b>numbers.</b> With the transition to computer assisted manufacturing systems, however, many of the weaknesses of this type of system have come to light. A newer approach to <b>part</b> <b>numbering,</b> the use of all numeric, nonsignificant <b>part</b> <b>numbers</b> as a vehicle for <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> and accessing the required information about each, may be a major contributor to improve communications in the computer age. This paper explores both approaches to part identification, addressing the advantages and drawbacks of each. It is concluded that the use of nonsignificant numbering, is indeed, the best approach to a flexible, simple, and standardized identification system, allowing access to all pertinent part information without incorporating that information in to the <b>part</b> <b>number.</b> Two case studies, one of a leading compressor manufacturer, and the other a producer of greeting cards, are presented, demonstrating the feasibility of a conversion from significant to nonsignificant systems and the benefits obtainable.

Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Nurul Choyimah, M. Pd. Keywords: Effectiveness, Song Lyrics, Parts of Speech 	The use of {{song lyrics}} as {{material}} {{in the classroom is}} very nice activity. It can be something attractive for the students. They can learn the material through the lyrics of song and sing the lyrics of song. It makes the students’ emotion to be good. So, they can enthusiastic and motivated to learn English material (parts of speech). But in the fact, the students still feel difficult in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech. Furthermore, the researcher tries to help the students’ ability in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech by learning the lyrics of song as the {{material in the}} classroom. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech before being taught by using song lyrics? 2) How is the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech after being taught by using song lyrics? 3) Is there any significant difference between the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech before and after being taught by using song lyrics? The purpose of this research are: 1) To find out the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech before being taught by using song lyrics. 2) To find out the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech after being taught by using song lyrics. 3) To find out the significant difference between the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech before and after being taught by using song lyrics. Research Method: 1) The research design in this study was pre-experimental design in the form of One-Group Pretest-Posttest designs with quantitative approach, 2) The population of this research is all students of eight grade at SMPN 1 Sumbergempol Tulungagung, 3) The sample was VIII B class consisting of 32 students, 4) The research instrument was test (pre-test and post-test), 5) The data analysis was using paired sample T- test by using SPSS 16. 0 for windows. The result showed that students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech before being taught by using song lyrics is 72. 66, while the students’ score in <b>identifying</b> <b>parts</b> of speech after being taught by using song lyrics is 85. 78.
