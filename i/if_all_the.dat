Assuming that such a situation does arise, the Prime Minister would be obliged to call a by-election within a reasonable time, unless he intends to call a general election in the near future.|$|E
5|$|Figs {{flower and}} fruit asynchronously. Flowering and fruiting is {{staggered}} throughout the population. This fact {{is important for}} fig wasps—female wasps {{need to find a}} syconium in which to lay their eggs within a few days of emergence, something that would not be possible <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> trees in a population flowered and fruited at the same time. This also makes figs important food resources for frugivores (animals that feed nearly exclusively on fruit); figs {{are one of the few}} fruit available at times of the year when fruit are scarce.|$|E
5|$|In {{an attempt}} to steal the six Chaos Emeralds and harness their power, the game's antagonist, Dr. Ivo Robotnik, has trapped the animal {{inhabitants}} of South Island in aggressive robots and stationary metal capsules. The player controls Sonic, who aims to halt Robotnik's plans by freeing his animal friends and collecting the emeralds himself. If the player collects all the Chaos Emeralds and completes the game, an ending sequence is shown. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> emeralds are not collected, Robotnik taunts the player while juggling any of the Chaos Emeralds not collected by the player.|$|E

On June 18, JAL signed a purchase agreement with Embraer for ten Embraer 170 jets, with options to acquire another five aircraft. The contract value was worth approximately US$435 million, <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> options are exercised. The aircraft was configured to seat 76 passengers in a single-class layout and was designated for J-Air.

5|$|The lack of armour on {{both ends}} of the design sparked controversy: after the former Chief Constructor of the Royal Navy Edward James Reed visited the ships under construction, he criticized this {{particular}} design feature, arguing that in case of damage to either end the entering water would have compromised the stability; the new Italian Minister of the Navy, Simone Pacoret di Saint-Bon, replied during a Parliament session that such an event was very unlikely, as it could happen only <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> bulkeads of the watertight compartments were destroyed.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{theory is that}} Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If they had all {{remained}} at the pass, {{they would have been}} encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.|$|E

5|$|The work {{eventually}} cost £211,000; {{it began}} in 1861, {{with the majority of}} the work being completed by 1870 and the additional iron shielding by 1874.

5|$|A {{major benefit}} of {{biodiesel}} is lower carbon emissions, although the energy balance of liquid biofuels {{is a matter}} of controversy. Research is being undertaken into converting rapeseed oil into biodiesel, and the European biofuels directive intended to ensure that 5.75% Europe's transport fuel came from renewable sources by 2010. There is only enough used vegetable oil in the UK to contribute 0.38% of current road fuel demand and <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> arable land in the UK were turned over to biofuel crops this would still only satisfy 22% of the existing requirement for road transport. Serious concerns regarding the ethics of growing biodiesel in developing countries and importing the fuel to Europe have been raised {{on the grounds that they}} may replace much needed food crops. Converting any mainstream transport system to a renewable one also involves the conundrum that for consumers to use it the infrastructure must be in place, but high levels of use may be required to finance the infrastructure. Developments are thus slow at present and renewably powered vehicles very much the exception.|$|E
5|$|Alongside {{the main}} {{narrative}} are side stories involving {{various members of}} Fortuna Entertainment, which Itsuki can help as he learns from working in various sectors of the agency's business. These quests' storylines include Tsubasa working to create her idol persona; Touma's wish to become an inspirational actor; Kiria's discomfort with her softer side, which clashes with her professional identity; Eleanora's attempts to polish her abilities as an actress {{in preparation for a}} hoped-for Hollywood career; Mamori pushing to expand her professional range beyond her cooking host role; Yashiro breaking out of his self-imposed personal and professional isolation, culminating in a battle with his father's spirit; the often-tipsy Maiko's efforts to maintain Fortuna's public and private functions; Barry's antics and his growing insecurity after losing his Mirage Master abilities; and Tiki wanting the chance to experience the real world. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> side stories are completed, a post-credits scene is unlocked where Maiko returns to modelling and makes Itsuki the new manager of Fortuna Entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Each summer (June, July, and August in the US), the {{producers}} would outline the storylines for the subsequent season. Before an episode went into production, Kauffman and Crane would revise the script written by another writer, mainly if something concerning either the series or a character felt foreign. Unlike other storylines, {{the idea for}} a relationship between Joey and Rachel was decided on halfway through the eighth season. The creators did not want Ross and Rachel to get back together so soon, and while looking for a romantic impediment, a writer suggested Joey's romantic interest in Rachel. The storyline was incorporated into the season; however, when the actors feared that the storyline would make their characters unlikable, the storyline was wrapped up, until it again resurfaced in the season's finale. For the ninth season, the writers were unsure about the amount of storyline to give to Rachel's baby, as they wanted the show neither to revolve around a baby nor pretend there to be none. Crane said that it took them a while to accept the idea of a tenth season, which they decided to do because they had enough stories left to tell to justify the season. Kauffman and Crane would not have signed on for an eleventh season, even <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> cast members had wanted to continue.|$|E

5|$|Gameplay in {{relation}} to The Lost Age's battle mode is similar to traditional role-playing video games. In each battle, the player is required to defeat all the enemies using direct attacks with weapons, offensive Psynergy spells, and other means of causing damage, all while keeping their own party alive through items and supportive Psynergy that restore life and supplement defense. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> player's characters are downed by reducing their hit points to zero, the party is returned to the last village that the player visited and suffers a monetary penalty. The successful completion of a battle yields experience points, coins, and occasionally rare items.

5|$|In each level, {{the player}} must {{complete}} certain objectives and then exit the stage. The requirements are varied, with many levels requiring the recovery {{and use of}} numerous high-tech gadgets. If Joanna is killed or fails an objective, the player must start the level again. Three distinct difficulty settings are available for each level, the choice of which will affect aspects such {{as the number of}} objectives that must be completed, enemy accuracy and damage, the effectiveness of the game's optional aiming assistance, and the availability of ammunition and protective shields. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> levels are completed on the highest difficulty, an additional setting becomes available, allowing players to customise various aspects of enemies, such as their health, their aiming accuracy and the damage they inflict. In addition to the main campaign, there are four bonus missions, with three enabling the player to control other characters with unique special abilities. Players can also unlock cheats by completing the levels within certain time limits.|$|E
5|$|King Henry's Articles, {{signed by}} each king since 1573, {{required}} the king {{to call a}} general sejm (lasting six weeks) every two years, and provisions for an extraordinary sejm (Polish: sejm ekstraordynaryjny, nadzwyczajny) that was to last two weeks were also set down in this act. Extraordinary sejms could be called in times of national emergency, for example a sejm deciding whether to call pospolite ruszenie (a general call to arms) {{in response to an}} invasion. The sejm could be extended <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> deputies agreed. No set time of a year was defined, but customarily sejms were called for a time that would not interfere with the supervision of agriculture, which formed the livelihood of most nobility; thus most sejms took place in late fall or early winter.|$|E

5|$|Knuckles' {{story begins}} in Mushroom Hill, {{where he is}} {{relaxing}} with his animal friends but is interrupted by a bomb dropped by EggRobo. This prompts Knuckles to chase after him, leading him {{through most of the}} same zones Sonic went through. The chase ends at the damaged remains of Sky Sanctuary, where a robot called Mecha Sonic attacks Knuckles but accidentally destroys EggRobo instead. After a short fight, Mecha Sonic uses the power of the Master Emerald to achieve a Super form similar to Sonic's. Knuckles manages to defeat Super Mecha Sonic, who explodes. Sonic flies in piloting the biplane Tornado and Knuckles hitches a ride to return the Master Emerald to Angel Island. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> Chaos Emeralds are collected, Angel Island rises upwards, into the sky. However, if the player has not collected all the Chaos Emeralds, Knuckles cannot redeem the Master Emerald, and Angel Island plummets into the ocean.|$|E

Before leaving, he explains to her that many students have recently left school to find work in the cities, and he offers her a 10 yuan bonus <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> students are still there when he returns.|$|E
5|$|Captain Smith was an {{experienced}} seaman {{who had served}} for 40 years at sea, including 27 years in command.

As Smith began to grasp the enormity of what was about to happen, he appears to have become paralysed by indecision. He had ordered passengers and crew to muster, but from that point onward, he failed to order his officers to put the passengers into the lifeboats; he did not adequately organise the crew; he failed to convey crucial information to his officers and crew; he sometimes gave ambiguous or impractical orders and he never gave the command to abandon ship. Even some of his bridge officers were unaware for some time after the collision that the ship was sinking; Fourth Officer Joseph Boxhall did not find out until 01:15, barely an hour before the ship went down, while Quartermaster George Rowe was so unaware of the emergency that after the evacuation had started, he phoned the bridge from his watch station to ask why he had just seen a lifeboat go past. Smith did not inform his officers that the ship did not have enough lifeboats to save everyone. He did not supervise the loading of the lifeboats and seemingly made no effort to find out if his orders were being followed.|$|E
