This research used time data series from 2003 – 2013 which are poverty as dependent variable and <b>Gross</b> Regional <b>Domestic</b> <b>Income</b> as independent variable. From the research finding it was found out that R was 0. 933 which indicated that there was positive connection between independent variable (<b>Gross</b> Regional <b>Domestic</b> <b>Income)</b> toward dependent variable (poverty). The result of the calculation was R 20 [...] 916 which meant the fluctuation of poverty was influenced by the sum of the citizens and <b>Gross</b> Regional <b>Domestic</b> <b>Income</b> by 91. 6 %.

5000|$|The NBER prefers {{this method}} {{for a variety}} of reasons. First, they feel by {{measuring}} a wide range of economic factors, rather than just GDP, a more accurate assessment of the health of an economy can be gained. For instance, the NBER considers not only the product-side estimates like GDP, but also income-side estimates such as the <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>income</b> (GDI). Second, since the NBER wishes to measure the duration of economic expansion and recession at a fine grain, they place emphasis on monthly—rather than quarterly—economic indicators. Finally, by using a looser definition, they can take into account the depth of decline in economic activity. For example, the NBER may declare not a recession simply because of two quarters of very slight negative growth, but rather an economic stagnation.However, they do not precisely define what is meant by [...] "a significant decline," [...] but rather determine if one has existed on a case by case basis after examining their catalogued factors which have no defined grade scale or weighting factors. The subjectivity of the determination has led to criticism and accusations committee members can [...] "play politics" [...] in their determinations.|$|E

Nemesis was released on December 13, 2002, in direct competition with Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets (released November 15, 2002), the 20th James Bond film Die Another Day (released November 22, 2002), and The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (released December 18, 2002). Rick Berman (executive producer of the film) has suggested that Nemesiss performance may have been negatively affected by [...] "the competition of other films". This poor performance was predicted by reviewers, due to the short period in the film's release before The Two Towers was released. The film's <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>income</b> was the lowest of the franchise at $43,254,409 as of September 2008.

40|$|ABSTRACT The two {{official}} measures of U. S. economic output, {{gross domestic product}} (GDP) and <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>income</b> (GDI), have shown markedly different business cycle fluctuations over the past 25 years, with GDI showing a more pronounced cycle than GDP. This paper reports {{a broad range of}} results that indicate that GDI better reflects the business cycle fluctuations in true output growth. Results on revisions to the estimates, and correlations with numerous other cyclically sensitive variables, are particularly favorable to GDI. The most recent GDI data show the 2007 – 09 downturn to have been considerably worse than is reflected in GDP. T he Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) produces two conceptually identical {{official measures}} of U.

40|$|Greenhouse gas {{emissions}} {{have been a}} growing concern throughout the world, particularly in the Western society. Agriculture {{has been identified as}} both a major source of greenhouse {{gas emissions}} and a potential solution in mitigating emissions through carbon sequestration. Changing agriculture current production practices (called conventional production system) to an organic production system can reduce the need for synthetically produced agricultural inputs, and thereby reduce these emissions. However, this may generate other co-benefits (or costs) to the society. The focus {{of this study was to}} evaluate the implications of converting conventional agriculture production system to an organic one for greenhouse gas emissions, level of agricultural production, farmer net income, regional and national level changes (in terms of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product, household <b>income,</b> and employment levels). The scope of the study was limited to the Prairie Provinces in Canada. This area was selected because it contained a majority of area under organic production system in Canada. Since there are several types of changes resulting from the conversion, a trade-off analysis was used to evaluate the overall desirability of the two options - conventional production system and the organic production system. Multiple models were used to estimate various criteria. These included: the Canadian Regional Agriculture Model (CRAM), the Greenhouse Gas Emissions Model (GHGEM), and the Canadian Agriculture Regional Development Input-Output Model (CARDIOM). The study concluded that converting land under conventional production system to an organic production system reduces greenhouse gas emissions and improves regional <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product, household <b>income,</b> and employment.

40|$|AbstractThis study aims to {{identify}} the principal components in ten prevailing factors, which would account for the influence of major economic variables on electricity consumption. Principal component analysis on these variables suggests two principal components, which respectively have Eigen-values of 8. 28 and 1. 04 and a cumulative variance of 82. 77 % and 93. 19 %. The regression results between electricity consumption and two principal components indicate close match between the calculated and the actual electricity consumption. The first principal component positively impact on electricity consumption, while the second one has negative influence. According to the coefficient of each variable in the combination, we found that <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> product, <b>income,</b> industrial output value, commodity exports, added services industry value, household numbers, percentage of rural population and price index impact positively on electricity consumption, while increase in commodity imports and efficiency of electricity reduces electricity consumption. These imply the possibility to control the fast growth of electricity consumption by imposing policies to revise the concerned factors...|$|R
