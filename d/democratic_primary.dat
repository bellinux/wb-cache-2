In his 1997 {{re-election}} campaign, he won the September 9 <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> handily, and he was unopposed in the November 4 general election.

Beginning in January 2000, Brown served {{as part of the}} first ever African-American majority {{in the history of the}} Buffalo Common Council.|$|E

5|$|During the U.S. Senate {{election}} in 1940, United States Attorney Maurice Milligan (Jacob Milligan's brother) and former governor Lloyd Stark both challenged Truman in the <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary.</b> Truman was politically weakened by Pendergast's imprisonment for income tax evasion the previous year; the senator had remained loyal, having claimed that Republican judges (not the Roosevelt administration) {{were responsible for}} the boss's downfall. St. Louis party leader Robert E. Hannegan's support of Truman proved crucial; he later brokered the deal that put Truman on the national ticket. In the end, Stark and Milligan split the anti-Pendergast vote in the Senate <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> and Truman won by a total of 8,000 votes. In the November election, Truman defeated Republican Manvel H. Davis by 51–49 percent.|$|E

5|$|In the 1968 <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> campaign, McCarthy {{staged a}} strong showing. Robert Kennedy entered the race, President Johnson withdrew and Vice President Hubert Humphrey ran instead. While McGovern privately favored Kennedy, McCarthy and Humphrey were {{both from the}} {{neighboring}} state of Minnesota and publicly McGovern remained neutral. McGovern hosted all three as they campaigned for the June 4 South Dakota <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary,</b> {{which resulted in a}} strong win by Kennedy to go along with his win in the crucial California primary that night. McGovern spoke with Kennedy by phone minutes before Kennedy was assassinated in Los Angeles. The death of Bobby Kennedy left McGovern the most emotionally distraught he had ever been to that point in his life.|$|E

5|$|In the July 15, 2008 <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> election, Jones won a {{plurality}} of votes in the <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary.</b> However, Georgia law requires a majority; if no majority is reached by a candidate, the two top vote-getters must face {{one another in a}} runoff. On August 5, 2008 Jones lost the run-off election to Jim Martin by a margin of 20 points. Jones unexpectedly lost to Martin in his home base of Dekalb County. Jones had lost support within the black community before the runoff election, and only captured two-thirds of the black vote in the head to head match up against Martin. The black turnout in the run-off was also substantially lower than the initial primary election, further hurting Vernon Jones' chances in the runoff.|$|E
5|$|On December 19, 1904, Barkley {{declared}} his candidacy for county attorney of McCracken County {{well before the}} March 1905 <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary.</b> The Republicans did not nominate a candidate, so the <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> was the de facto general election. Barkley faced two opponents in the primary – two-term incumbent Eugene A. Graves and Paducah Police Court Judge David Cross. He organized his own campaign and made speeches across the county, showcasing his eloquence and likeability. Graves received more votes than Barkley in Paducah, but McCracken County's rural farmers gave Barkley the victory, 1,525 votes to 1,096; Cross came in third with 602 votes. This {{was the only time}} Barkley ever challenged an incumbent Democrat.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> {{was held}} on September 14. Turnout was high; though the mayoral {{candidates}} expected about 100,000 voters, about half of Baltimore's 294,000 registered voters voted in the primary elections.|$|E
5|$|The {{other three}} {{candidates}} in the <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> were regarded as unlikely to win; when the election was held, the three combined drew less than 3% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|When the President of the Massachusetts Senate, William M. Bulger, {{announced}} his resignation from his 1st Suffolk seat in late 1995, Lynch filed nomination papers {{for the special}} election to replace him. Bulger's son, attorney William M. Bulger, Jr. ran for the seat. Another lawyer, Patrick Loftus, also ran for the <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary.</b> The race grew from the grassroots of South Boston, with neighborhood issues such as development, crime, and education ruling the debate. The candidates declared their mutual respect. In a stunning victory, Lynch won the <b>Democratic</b> <b>primary</b> in March 1996, defeating Bulger Jr. and Loftus 56–35–9%. In April, he defeated Republican Richard William Czubinski 96–4% and was inaugurated on May 1, 1996. He won re-election unopposed in 1996, 1998, and 2000.|$|E
