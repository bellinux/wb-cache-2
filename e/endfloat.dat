40|$|The ccaption package enables {{restyling}} of captions {{and provides}} for ‘continuation’ captions, unnumbered captions, bilingual captions, and an ‘anonymous’ caption (a legend) {{that can be}} used in any environment. It also provides commands to define captions {{that can be used}} outside float environments as well as a mechanism for creating new types of float environments and subfloats. The package has been tested in conjunction with the tocloft rotating, caption 2, sidecap, subfigure, <b>endfloat</b> and hyperref packages...|$|E
40|$|Reconstruction of {{the linear}} power {{spectrum}} from observational data {{provides a way}} to compare cosmological models to {{a large amount of}} data, as Peacock & Dodds (1994, 1996) have shown. By applying the appropriate corrections to the observational power spectrum it is possible to recover the underlying linear power spectrum for any cosmological model. Using extensive N-body simulations we demonstrate that the method is applicable {{to a wide range of}} cosmological models. However, we find that the recovery of the linear power spectrum from observations following PD 94 is misleading because the corrections are model- dependent. When we apply the proper corrections for a given model to the observational power spectrum, we find that no model in our test group recovers the linear power spectrum well for the bias suggested by PD 94 between Abell, Radio, Optical, and IRAS catalogs 4. 5 : 1. 9 : 1. 3 : 1, with b_IRAS= 1. When we allow b_IRAS to vary we find that: (i) CHDM models give very good fits to observations if optically-selected galaxies are slightly biased b_Opt= 1. 1 (ii) Most LCDM models give worse but acceptable fits if blue galaxies are considerably antibiased: 0. 6 <b_Opt< 0. 9 and fail if optical galaxies are biased. (iii) There is a universal shape of the recovered linear power spectrum of all LCDM models over their entire range of explored wavenumbers, 0. 01 <k< 0. 6 h. Recovered spectra of CDM and CHDM models are nearly the same as that of LCDM in the region 0. 01 <k< 0. 2 h/Mpc but diverge from this spectrum at higher k. Comment: submitted to the Mon. Not. R.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} quantum phase {{transition}} in the Bose-Hubbard model borrowing two tools from quantum-information theory, i. e. the ground-state fidelity and entanglement measures. We consider systems at unitary filling comprising up to 50 sites and show {{for the first time}} that a finite-size scaling analysis of these quantities provides excellent estimates for the quantum critical point. We conclude that fidelity is particularly suited for revealing a {{quantum phase transition}} and pinning down the critical point thereof, while the success of entanglement measures depends on the mechanisms governing the transition. Comment: 7 pages, 5 figures (<b>endfloats</b> used due to problems with figures and latex. Sorry about that); final version, similar to the published on...|$|R
