While William Styron's Sophie's Choice was {{acceptable}} because of its anti-fascist themes, his The Confessions of Nat Turner was banned because it implied that all rebellions were <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail.</b> Likewise, sexual content was taboo in the USSR, and John Updike's Rabbit series, which she translated, had to be sanitised. Her longest battle against the censor was an eighteen-year struggle to publish Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, which was finally allowed to come out in 1982.|$|E
50|$|Determined {{to return}} to Alabastra, the Fateless One and their allies - Agarth, Alyn Shir, Cydan and Ventrinio - help {{spearhead}} the Alfar counter-attack through Klurikon and into Alabastra. Splitting up, each {{make their way into}} the heart of Gadflow's kingdom, with the Fateless One eventually happening upon Alyn Shir and a dead Ventrinio. Alyn Shir reveals that the Fateless One was her fellow member of a non-descript organization dedicated to protecting the secret of Tirnoch's existence and her true nature, silencing any who might learn and ensuring Tirnoch's continued imprisonment. She reveals that Tirnoch is a dragon, with powers that rival those of Amalur's gods, who had previously foreseen the Fateless One's dedication to their mission to destroy Tirnoch, as well as the fact that the Fateless One was <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> and die. Tirnoch helped revive them through the Well of Souls, freeing the Fateless One of the dictates of Fate, so that the Fateless One might return and be used to set her free.|$|E
50|$|The {{leaders of}} the {{republic}} tried to organize and establish administration {{in the city and}} its outskirts, and the new periodical Zabaykalsky Rabochy was issued in Chita on December 7, 1905, but the republic was <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> after the suppression of the uprisings in Moscow and Saint Petersburg. Troops loyal to the regime, led by Paul von Rennenkampf and general Miller-Zakomelsky, were sent to suppress the rebellious territory; it was quickly subjugated and Chita was occupied by government troops on 22 January 1906."At the beginning of 1906 Kurnatovsky was again arrested and sentenced to death. General Rennenkampf, the pacifier of Siberia, carried the condemned man in his train so that he might witness with his own eyes the executions of workers at every railway station."The six {{leaders of the}} Chita Republic were shot on the slope of Titovsky sopka. Kurnatovsky's death sentence was later commuted to life-long exile to Siberia. In the memory {{of the leaders of the}} Chita Republic, several central streets of Chita were named after them (Babushkina street, Kurnatovsky street, etc.).|$|E
50|$|The Idle Argument was {{anticipated}} by Aristotle in his De Interpretatione chapter 9. The Stoics considered {{it to be}} a sophism and the Stoic Chrysippus attempted to refute it by pointing out that consulting the doctor would be as much fated as recovering. He seems to have introduced the idea that in cases like that at issue two events can be co-fated, so that one cannot occur without the other. It is, however, a false argument because it <b>fails</b> <b>to</b> consider that those <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> recover may be those <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> consult a doctor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Software {{companies}} rely on stored {{metric data}} {{in order to}} track and manage their projects, through analyzing, monitoring and estimating software metrics. If managers cannot believe the metrics data, the product that is being developed is <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail.</b> Currently, the assessment of software effort is subjective and derived mainly through managers ’ assumptions, which is fundamentally an error-prone process. We present an architecture for assessing data quality of software effort metric based on data provenance associated with a mechanism of logical inference (fuzzy logic). The contribution is to provide an assessment to search evident reasons for a low quality {{in order to ensure}} that the metrics can be used with sufficient reliability. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} frequency and deal size of {{mergers and acquisitions}} (M&A) in market contradict the general agreement that {{a large proportion of}} M&A fail to benefit shareholders of acquiring firms. The reasons of taking M&A for companies can be complex, but it is possible that people factor risk the success of M&A from the beginning. As CEO compensation considered to be a force for CEOs to make effort to engage their companies to M&A, failure of M&A to some extent depends on perceptual factor. To explore the potential link between M&A motive and M&A failure, also inspired by the research of Harford and Li (2007) on CEO compensation, then in this article, research is launched following the clue of thought that M&A motives, M&A failure determinants and CEO compensation are progressively related. Consequently, the whole research analyse the research objective combining literal and empirical methods. The final result suggests certain degree of possibility for CEOs to take M&A action perceptually and M&A activity may <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{article is}} a {{synthetic}} and comparative study of theoretical grounds of monetary concepts developement adopted in Poland {{in the interwar period}} and after the World War two. Various monetary theories formed the grounds of those concepts, they were implemented in the two different socio-political systems and under different economic conditions. Their choice was determined by distinct doctrines of political economy. Having the said assumptions in mind the authoress attempted to find the reason for inefficiencies of monetary systems and their financial-credit policies based ori adopted monetary concepts. Sharing her reflections on the monetary concepts, the authoress pointed out that fallacies in the very concepts, improper handling and utilization of money instrument in economy, and no adjustments made in the concepts for the given conditions made the financial-credit policies <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail.</b> It was also indicated that recently forwarded propositions related to changes in rates of exchange and financial-credit policies are directed in a correct way.

40|$|In {{opposition}} {{to a number of}} the presentations at the Conference, we argue that the development of foodcrop agriculture needs to be considered as a pivotal poverty reduction strategy in Africa-in spite of the sector's erratic performance which has seen a number of 'mini-green revolutions' take off, falter and crash back to earth. We insist that for at least five reasons-the scale-neutrality of hybrid seed technology, its labour-intensity, its tendency to reduce risks, its ability to reduce the prices of poor people's basic foods and its ability to stimulate off-farm linkages-the hybrid seed revolution, partial though it has been, needs to be supported and sustained, and not dismissed as <b>fated</b> <b>to</b> <b>fail</b> in African conditions. We support this conclusion by two estimates of poverty impact of these 'new' technologies-a quick and dirty estimate based on four channels of impact only (income of adopter households, labour market, consumer prices and off-farm linkages) and an estimate derived from a multi-market model of Uganda, in which about one-tenth of the poverty reduction achieved in Uganda since 1992 is ascribed to productivity change in maize and cassava. We note that a number of domestic and aid policy factors-from weak rural infrastructure and financial systems to food aid-have tended to reduce either the incentive to introduce new technologies, and|or the poverty-elasticity of their introduction. To reduce many of the different poverties from which Africa suffers, we argue, the policies responsible for the underdevelopment of its cereal crops need coordinated reform across many countries; in preparing such reform, inspiration can be taken from the policies which preceded the surge in agricultural productivity in India, Indonesia and China 30 years ago.
