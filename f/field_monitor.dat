40|$|New Jersey Department of Environmental Protection (NJDEP) is in {{the process}} of {{certifying}} removal efficiencies of total suspended solids (TSS) for various manufactured treatment devices (MTDs). Prior to the certification, the removal efficiencies are verified by New Jersey Corporation for Advanced Technology (NJCAT) under some specific laboratory testing and <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> conditions. However, the TSS removal performance is expected to vary with operating flow rates, unit sizes, and laboratory or field evaluation techniques. Several technical issues related to the uniform certification have been researched. Among them are difference between TSS and suspended sediment concentration (SSC), extrapolation of operating flow rates, unit size scaling, impacts of particle size and influent concentration, and possibility of bottom sediment re-suspension. NJDEP has made amendments to the TARP <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> protocol to further constrain the <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> conditions and to additionally require the particle size measurements and the sediment re-suspension tests.

40|$|Purpose To {{assess the}} utility of {{concurrent}} magnetic <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> for observing and correcting for variations in k-space trajectories and global background fields that occur in single-shot echo planar imaging (EPI) time series as typically used in functional MRI (fMRI). Methods <b>Field</b> <b>monitoring</b> was performed using an array of NMR field probes operated concurrently with series of single-shot EPI acquisitions from a static phantom. The observed fluctuations in field evolution were analyzed {{in terms of their}} temporal and spatial behavior at the field level {{as well as at the}} level of reconstructed image series. The potential to correct for such fluctuations was assessed by accounting for them upon image reconstruction. An indication of the number and relative magnitude of underlying effects was obtained via principal component analysis. Results Trajectory and global field variations were found to induce substantial image fluctuations. Global field fluctuations induced standard deviations in image intensity up to 31 %. Fluctuations in the trajectory induced ghosting artifacts with standard deviations up to 2 %. Concurrent magnetic <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> reduced the fluctuations in the EPI time series to a maximum of 1. 2 %. Conclusion Concurrent magnetic <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> holds the potential to improve the net sensitivity of fMRI by reducing signal fluctuations unrelated to brain activity.

A <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> was carried out to collect matric suction data at slope in two conditions; with a tree located at toe of slope and absent of a tree.

The use of the dynamic load factor (DLF) {{to account for the}} impact effect has been widely accepted in bridge engineering. Although the <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> studies are the most dependable way to study the actual DLF of the bridge, according to previous studies there are few <b>field</b> <b>monitoring</b> data on high-speed railway truss arch bridges.
