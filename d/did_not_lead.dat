5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he is often described as one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|All {{medical records}} and documents, {{including}} Poe's death certificate, have been lost, {{if they ever}} existed. The precise cause of Poe's death is disputed, but many theories exist. Many biographers have addressed the issue and reached different conclusions, ranging from Jeffrey Meyers' assertion that it was hypoglycemia to John Evangelist Walsh's conspiratorial murder plot theory. It has also been suggested that Poe's death might have resulted from suicide related to depression. In 1848, he nearly died from an overdose of laudanum, readily available as a tranquilizer and pain killer. Though it is unclear {{if this was a}} true suicide attempt or just a miscalculation on Poe's part, it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to Poe's death a year later.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} of the 5th National Congress, the party {{leadership}} had turned into a veritable gerontocracy. The five most powerful Politburo members were all over the age of 70; Lê Duẩn was 74, Trường Chinh was 75, Phạm Văn Đồng was 76, Phạm Hùng was 70 and Lê Đức Thọ was 72. Lê Duẩn {{is believed to have been}} in bad health during this period; he had travelled to the Soviet Union on several occasions for medical treatment during the late-1970s and early 1980s. It was reported that Lê Duẩn <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> the party delegates of the 5th National Congress to the Hồ Chí Minh Mausoleum because of his deteriorating health. Lê Duẩn looked both feeble and old; he had problems reading his report to the Congress.|$|E
5|$|Facing {{significant}} changes in the 2006–07 season, Näslund's points total continued to decrease. He began the season by scoring his 300thgoal as a Canuck during the team's home-opener against the San Jose Sharks on 14 October 2006. The goal tied Canucks teammate Trevor Linden for the franchise lead in all-time goals. He soon surpassed Linden with his 301stgoal against the Edmonton Oilers on 17 October. Near the midway point of the season, however, Näslund went through a 17-game stretch without a goal. He completed the season with 60points, his lowest output since 1997–98. Teammate Daniel Sedin had 84points, marking the first time in eight seasons that Näslund <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> the team in scoring. In the 2007post-season, Näslund contributed five points before the team was eliminated by the Anaheim Ducks in the Conference Semifinals.|$|E
5|$|Forms of {{traditional}} football have been played throughout Europe and beyond since antiquity. Many of these involved {{handling of the}} ball, and scrummage-like formations. These archaic forms of football, typically classified as mob football, would be played between neighboring towns and villages, involving an unlimited number of players on opposing teams, who would clash in a heaving mass of people struggling to drag an inflated pig's bladder by any means possible to markers {{at each end of}} a town. By some accounts, in some such events any means could be used to move the ball towards the goal, as long as it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to manslaughter or murder. These antiquated games went into sharp decline in the 19th century when the Highway Act 1835 was passed banning the playing of football on public highways.|$|E

A number of teams were in competition for these Wild Card spots, along with their divisional competition. The Rangers spent over 80 days leading the American League West and shared the lead as late as September 4. The Rays spent only a few days leading the American League East, but held a share of the lead as late as August 24. The Cleveland Indians <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> the American League Central after July 2 but remained close throughout the season and ultimately finished just a single game back of the Central champion Detroit Tigers.|$|E
5|$|Industry {{appeared}} {{very early}} in Sélestat. The town had already several factories {{at the beginning of}} the 19th century: a tilery, a sawmill, 12 tanneries and 11 mills. Sélestat quickly became specialised in wire gauze making but it never became a large industrial centre, remaining a small town with limited influence. The completion of the Strasbourg-Basel railway (1840), one of the first to be built in France, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to significant urban development. The town walls that still encircled the town were a significant factor in its economic and demographic stagnation. After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Alsace and a part of Lorraine were annexed by the new German Empire. The German authorities demolished the city walls in 1874 and built new spacious neighbourhoods around the old town, as they did in Strasbourg and Metz.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon's triumph at Marengo secured his {{political}} authority and boosted his popularity back home, but it <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to an immediate peace. Bonaparte's brother, Joseph, led the complex negotiations in Lunéville {{and reported that}} Austria, emboldened by British support, would not acknowledge the new territory that France had acquired. As negotiations became increasingly fractious, Bonaparte gave orders to his general Moreau to strike Austria once more. Moreau and the French swept through Bavaria and scored an overwhelming victory at Hohenlinden in December 1800. As a result, the Austrians capitulated and signed the Treaty of Lunéville in February 1801. The treaty reaffirmed and expanded earlier French gains at Campo Formio. Britain now remained the only nation that was still at war with France.|$|E

5|$|Silver {{was one of}} {{the seven}} metals of antiquity that were known to prehistoric humans and whose {{discovery}} is thus lost to history. In particular, the three metals of group 11, copper, silver, and gold, occur in the elemental form in nature and were probably used as the first primitive forms of money as opposed to simple bartering. However, unlike copper, silver <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to the growth of metallurgy on account of its low structural strength, and was more often used ornamentally or as money. Since silver is more reactive than gold, supplies of native silver were much more limited than those of gold. For example, silver was more expensive than gold in Egypt until around the fifteenth century BC: the Egyptians are thought to have separated gold from silver by heating the metals with salt, and then reducing the silver chloride produced to the metal.|$|E
5|$|The P.1154 {{was judged}} to be {{technically}} superior, however, the Mirage acquired a greater level of political palatability due to the co-operative development and production aspects proposed for the programme, which spread work across a number of member nations. Protracting political maneuvering by firms and national governments alike was deployed in attempts to secure their respective project's selection. The P.1154 was ultimately selected to meet NBMR-3, however this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to orders being placed. The French government subsequently withdrew from participation once the Dassault design had not emerged victorious. NATO lacked any central budget, relying on individual member nations to actually procure military equipment, and the NBMR-3 selection went unheeded by all of these nations. Thus, in 1965, the whole project was terminated.|$|E
5|$|The Red River Trails {{are less}} well known today than many other pioneer trails and trade routes in North America, and do not occupy as large a place in {{folklore}} as the great western trails in the United States and the fur-trading canoe routes of Canada. They were neither fought over nor the locus of battles (with {{the exception of the}} Dakota War of 1862), and although hazardous at times, other trails presented greater dangers. It may be that this relative lack of attention {{is due to the fact}} they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to annexation of any territory to either of the nations in which the trails were located.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect has implications for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|There is {{very strong}} {{evidence}} that comets have previously been fragmented and collided with Jupiter and its satellites. During the Voyager missions to the planet, planetary scientists identified 13 crater chains on Callisto and three on Ganymede, the origin of which was initially a mystery. Crater chains seen on the Moon often radiate from large craters, and {{are thought to be}} caused by secondary impacts of the original ejecta, but the chains on the Jovian moons <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> back to a larger crater. The impact of SL9 strongly implied that the chains were due to trains of disrupted cometary fragments crashing into the satellites.|$|E
5|$|Warfarin {{is used to}} cull {{vampire bat}} populations in areas where human-wildlife {{conflict}} is a concern. Vampire bats are captured with mist nets and coated {{with a combination of}} petroleum jelly and warfarin. The bat returns to its roost {{and other members of the}} roost become poisoned as well by ingesting the warfarin after reciprocal grooming. Suspected vampire bat roosts may also be coated in the warfarin solution, though this kills other bat species and remains in the environment for years. The efficacy of killing vampire bats to reduce rabies transmission is questionable, however; a study in Peru showed that culling programs <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>lead</b> to lower transmission rates of rabies to livestock and humans.|$|E
