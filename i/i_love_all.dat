500|$|On May 11, 1988, Mirth & Girth was {{displayed}} at a private exhibition {{in one of the}} school's main interior hallways. The painting was part of a set of six that Nelson was displaying in a judged three-day student fellowship exhibition held to showcase upcoming graduates. Another of his works was a self-portrait titled [...] "I'm Sensitive, and <b>I</b> <b>Love</b> <b>All</b> Humanity", depicting Nelson holding little people of multiple nationalities. As soon as the exhibit opened, between 7:30 and 8:30 am, the painting drew enough negative attention for the Art Institute to post a security guard in front of the painting. Shortly thereafter, the school began to receive angry phone calls about the painting.|$|E
500|$|Mars {{claims that}} his work with other artists has {{influenced}} his musical style: [...] " [...] Nothin' on You had a Motown vibe, Billionaire was a reggae acoustic guitar-driven song, though one of my favourites is the CeeLo Green song. I don't think anyone else could've sung that song. And there's Just the Way You Are. If you know my story, you know <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>all</b> different genres of music." [...] Mars states that growing up in Hawaii influenced his style, giving the songs a reggae sound. He explains: [...] "In Hawaii {{some of the biggest}} radio stations are reggae. That music brings people together. It's not urban music or pop music. It's just songs. That's what makes it cross over so well. The song comes first." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{questioned}} further {{about the}} lyrics, Jackson denied that [...] "They Don't Care About Us" [...] was antisemitic, commenting [...] "It's not anti-Semitic because I'm not a racist person... I {{could never be}} a racist. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>all</b> races." [...] That same day, Jackson received support from his manager and record label, who described the lyrics as [...] "brilliant", that they were about opposition to prejudice and taken out of context. The following day, David A. Lehrer and Rabbi Marvin Hier, leaders of two Jewish organizations, stated that Jackson's attempt to make a song critical of discrimination had backfired. They expressed the opinion that the lyrics used were unsuitable for young audiences because they might not understand the song's context and that the song was ambiguous {{for some of the}} listeners. They acknowledged that Jackson meant well and suggested that he write an explanation in the album booklet.|$|E

2500|$|During Bucharest's annual GayFest in June 2007, Becali {{seemed to}} have {{tempered}} his homophobic stance. He declared {{in an interview that}} [...] "I love them [...] {{in the same way that}} <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>all</b> other people. They can marry at the City Hall, every day, 10 of them if they want to. But in church, they don't have a place."

[...] "The song 'Apology' for example was from the first demo sessions. We tried that song a year later completely differently ... way more up-tempo and it just didn't feel right. It didn't serve the song and what Raine was saying {{and how he was}} singing dictated how we were playing. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>all</b> the songs on the record, but that was a very magical, musical moment because it was so organic the way that happened." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{results of}} the {{sessions}} were released in November 1997 as the seventeenth Yes studio album, Open Your Eyes (on the Beyond Music label, who ensured that the group had greater control in packaging and naming). The music (mainly at Sherwood's urging) attempted to bridge the differing Yes styles of the 1970s and 1980s. (Sherwood: [...] "My goal {{was to try to}} break down those partisan wallsâ€”because all of the music was so good. There are people who won't listen to Genesis, say, after 1978, but I can't imagine that. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>all</b> music. That was the one thing I tried to do, to bring unity. During the time I was with Yes, you heard new things, and classic things. For that, I am proud â€” to have aligned planets for a moment in time.") However, Open Your Eyes [...] was not a chart success; the record peaked at number 151 on the Billboard 200 but failed to enter the charts in the UK.

Let them meet in the park, 300, 500 of them, to make a show. I would have nothing against it, but a parade, propaganda? It is abnormal." [...] Becali, {{who is also the}} president of the Steaua football club, stated that he doesn't want any more homosexuals coming to Ghencea Stadium, but later appeared to contradict himself by saying [...] "Discrimination? It's discrimination if I don't let them come. Where's the discrimination?" [...] The National Council for Combating Discrimination announced that it will be investigating if Becali's comments breach Romania's anti-discrimination laws, which also cover speech. In a later interview, however, Becali declared, [...] "I love them [...] {{in the same way that}} <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>all</b> other people.

2500|$|Eden Riegel {{was cast}} in 2000 as Bianca Montgomery, the lesbian {{daughter}} of Erica Kane. Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show. [...] "I definitely wanted to fulfill that desire if I could," [...] she said. Riegel then let the show know she was willing to come back. [...] " [...] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. <b>I</b> <b>love</b> <b>All</b> My Children, and theyâ€™re my family. I barely need an excuse -- itâ€™s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time {{it was the fact that}} they were going to have Bianca in a committed relationship". She stated, [...] "It was very, very important to me, and I was so glad to hear that. In the context of that, thereâ€™s some pretty exciting story line plot points that Iâ€™m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun. [...] "It means so much [...] because it shows how committed AMC is to this pairing," [...] Riegel said in an interview with Soap Opera Weekly. [...] "We're going to have some serious stuff to play- they aren't going to waste her talents." ...|$|E
