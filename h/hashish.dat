5|$|Hergé took {{influence}} from the published works of French adventurer and gunrunner Henry de Monfreid, particularly his books Secrets of the Red Sea and The <b>Hashish</b> Cruise. Having {{lived through the}} First World War, Hergé disliked arms dealers, and used Monfreid {{as the basis for}} the gunrunner character in Cigars.|$|E
5|$|On June 19, 1969, Hendrix flew to Toronto for a {{preliminary}} hearing. He wore {{a business suit}} {{for the first time}} since before the formation of the Experience in late 1966. Judge Robert Taylor presided over the hearing, setting a date for December 8, at which Hendrix would stand trial for two counts of possession of heroin and <b>hashish,</b> for which he faced as many as 20 years in prison. More serious potential charges of drug transporting and trafficking, which had been discussed at the time of the arrest, were not filed.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, customs {{agents at}} Toronto International Airport {{detained}} Hendrix after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and <b>hashish</b> in his luggage. Four hours later, after a mobile lab confirmed what had been found, he was formally charged with drug possession. Released on $10,000 bail, Hendrix was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. During a performance at Maple Leaf Gardens later that night, he displayed a jovial attitude, joking with the audience and singing a few lines of mock opera for comedic effect.|$|E
5|$|Al-Qassam {{concentrated}} {{his activities}} on the lower classes, setting up a night school for casual laborers and preaching to them as an imam, first in the Jerini Mosque, {{and later in the}} Istiqlal Mosque. He would seek them out on the streets, in brothels and <b>hashish</b> dens. His greatest following came from the landless ex-tenant farmers drifting into Haifa from the Upper Galilee where purchases of agricultural land by the Jewish National Fund and Hebrew labor policies excluding Arabs had dispossessed many of their traditional livelihoods. Al-Qassam grew increasingly popular with northern Palestine's poorer Muslims and was frequently sought out to preach at Mawlid celebrations.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to <b>hashish</b> possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or instruments to be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E
5|$|Hay {{enrolled}} at Brown in 1855. Although he enjoyed college life, {{he did not}} find it easy: his Western clothing and accent made him stand out; he was not well prepared academically and was often sick. Hay gained {{a reputation as a}} star student and became a part of Providence's literary circle that included Sarah Helen Whitman and Nora Perry. He wrote poetry and experimented with <b>hashish.</b> Hay received his Master of Arts degree in 1858, and was, like his grandfather before him, Class Poet. He returned to Illinois. Milton Hay had moved his practice to Springfield, and John became a clerk in his firm, where he could study law.|$|E
5|$|On May 3, 1969, while Hendrix {{was passing}} through customs at Toronto International Airport, {{authorities}} detained him after finding {{a small amount}} of what they suspected to be heroin and <b>hashish</b> in his luggage. Four hours later, he was formally charged with drug possession and released on $10,000 bail. He was required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. The incident proved stressful for Hendrix, and it weighed heavily on his mind during the seven months that he awaited trial, which took place in December of that year. For the Crown to prove possession they had to show that Hendrix knew the drugs were there. During the jury trial he testified that a fan had given him a vial of what he thought was legal medication, which he put in his bag not knowing what was in it. He was acquitted of the charges. Mitchell and Redding later revealed that everyone had been warned about a planned drug bust the day before flying to Toronto; both men also stated they believed that the drugs had been planted in Hendrix's bag without his knowledge.|$|E
5|$|One {{source of}} {{tensions}} in the western and southwestern states was the influx of Mexicans to the U.S. following the 1910 Mexican Revolution. Many Mexicans also smoked marijuana to relax after working in the fields. It was also seen as a cheaper alternative to alcohol, due to Prohibition (which went into effect nationally in 1920). Later in the 1920s, negative tensions grew between the small farms and the large farms that used cheaper Mexican labor. Shortly afterwards, the Great Depression came which increased tensions as jobs and resources became more scarce. Because of that, {{the passage of the}} initial laws is often described as a product of racism, yet use of <b>hashish</b> by near eastern immigrants was also cited, as well as the misuse of pharmaceutical hemp, and the laws conformed with other legislation that was being passed around the country. Mexico itself had passed prohibition in 1925, following the International Opium Convention (see below).|$|E
25|$|Graney contributed {{music to}} {{and played a}} small (musical) part in a stage {{production}} of the 1960s British play Stone in 2004. Graney and Moore released a double album , <b>Hashish</b> and Liquor, in 2005, with the first disc, <b>Hashish</b> performed by Graney and the second, Liquor by Moore.|$|E

25|$|Paul Branzburg of The (Louisville) Courier-Journal, in {{the course}} of his {{reporting}} duties, witnessed people manufacturing and using <b>hashish.</b> He wrote two articles concerning drug use in Kentucky. The first featured unidentified hands holding <b>hashish,</b> while the second included marijuana users as sources. These sources requested not to be identified. Both of the articles were brought to attention of law-enforcement personnel. Branzburg was subpoenaed before a grand jury for both of the articles. He was ordered to name his sources.|$|E
25|$|On September 19, 2012 Apple {{was arrested}} at an {{internal}} Border Patrol checkpoint in Sierra Blanca, Texas and charged with possession of <b>hashish.</b> Authorities detained Apple at the Hudspeth County Jail.|$|E
25|$|Pfc. Moore, of Severna Park, Maryland, {{faced the}} fewest charges among the group. Moore {{pleaded guilty to}} using <b>hashish</b> during the deployment. He was demoted to private and had to forfeit half a month’s pay.|$|E
25|$|During {{the summer}} of 2010, the {{military}} charged {{five members of the}} platoon with murder of three Afghan civilians in Kandahar Province and collecting their body parts as trophies. In addition, seven soldiers were charged with crimes such as <b>hashish</b> use, impeding an investigation, and attacking the whistleblower, Private First Class Justin Stoner.|$|E
25|$|It {{was also}} {{revealed}} that amongst the pardoned figured a drug trafficking suspect, who was released before standing trial. He had resisted arrest using a firearm. There was, Antonio Garcia, a recidivist drug trafficker arrested in possession of 9 tons of <b>Hashish</b> in Tangiers and sentenced to 10 years. Some media claimed that his release embarrassed Spain.|$|E
25|$|March 6, 2007, ICE removed Muhammed Abdi Afrid to Pakistan. Afrid was paroled {{into the}} United States on March 5, 2003 to face federal {{criminal}} charges in California. The United States Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of California charged Afrid with conspiracy to distribute <b>hashish</b> and heroin and conspiracy to provide material support to {{a terrorist group}} based on an incident in China on September 16, 2002 wherein Afrid attempted to purchase stinger missiles from an undercover U.S. agent in exchange for five tons of <b>hashish</b> and 600 kilograms of heroin. Afrid planned to sell the missiles to the Taliban. On April 3, 2006, Afrid received a five-year sentence to federal prison for these offenses. ICE placed Afrid in removal proceedings and charged him with being removable {{on account of his}} criminal conviction. An immigration judge ordered his removal on December 14, 2006.|$|E
25|$|By 1857, Fitz Hugh Ludlow {{had become}} a known <b>hashish</b> addict and the bestselling author of The Hasheesh Eater. In 1859, he married Rosalie Osborne in her {{hometown}} of Waterville, New York. Her mother had reservations about Ludlow, who continuously struggled with finances. At one point, Rosalie was forced to write at least one job inquiry for him in a letter that could have been construed as flirtatious.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 26 {{varieties}} of hemp with {{low levels of}} tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are certified by the European Union (EU). They have, unlike other types, a very high fiber content of 30-40%. In contrast to cannabis for medical use, varieties grown for fiber and seed have less than 0.2% THC and they are unsuitable for producing <b>hashish</b> and marijuana. The most important cannabinoid in industrial hemp is cannabidiol (CBD) with a proportion of 1 to 5%.|$|E
25|$|Smuggling: During {{the civil}} war, Lebanon turned {{into one of}} the world's largest {{narcotics}} producers, with much of the <b>hashish</b> production centered in the Bekaa valley. But much else was also smuggled, such as guns and supplies, all kinds of stolen goods, and regular trade – war or no war, Lebanon would not give up its role as the middleman in European-Arab business. Many battles were fought over Lebanon's ports, to gain smugglers access to the sea routes.|$|E
25|$|Pfc. Justin Stoner was {{the soldier}} who caused the {{investigation}} to begin. He caught {{a few members}} of his unit smoking <b>hashish</b> and as a result was later beaten by unit members. When his injuries were taken up his chain of command, he had to explain what happened. He then admitted he knew of murders committed by SSG Gibbs and other unit members, which opened up the case. Stoner was not charged and was honorably discharged in 2012.|$|E
25|$|The {{prohibition}} on alcohol under Islamic Sharia law, {{which is usually}} attributed to passages in the Qur'an, {{dates back to the}} 7th century. Although Islamic law is often interpreted as prohibiting all intoxicants (not only alcohol), the ancient practice of <b>hashish</b> smoking has continued throughout the history of Islam, against varying degrees of resistance. A major campaign against hashish-eating Sufis was conducted in Egypt in the 11th and 12th centuries resulting among other things in the burning of fields of cannabis.|$|E
25|$|He {{sought the}} company of artists such as Utrillo and Soutine, seeking {{acceptance}} and validation for his work from his colleagues. Modigliani's behavior stood out even in these Bohemian surroundings: he carried on frequent affairs, drank heavily, and used absinthe and <b>hashish.</b> While drunk, he would sometimes strip himself naked at social gatherings. He died in Paris, aged 35. He became the epitome of the tragic artist, creating a posthumous legend almost as well known as that of Vincent van Gogh.|$|E
25|$|Panizza {{became an}} avid {{member of the}} Gesellschaft für modernes Leben (Society for Modern Life), which Conrad founded in 1890 {{together}} with Detlev von Liliencron, Otto Julius Bierbaum, Julius Schaumberger, Hanns von Gumppenberger and Georg Schaumberg. One of Panizza's notable presentations was a lecture in 1891 titled Genie und Wahnsinn (Genius and Madness), which drew heavily {{on the work of}} Cesare Lombroso. Of particular interest even today are Panizza's discussions of hallucinations and model psychosis, <b>hashish</b> and the hallucinatory basis of religion.|$|E
25|$|Morocco {{consistently}} {{ranks among}} the world's largest producers and exporters of cannabis, and its cultivation and sale provide the economic base for much of northern Morocco. The cannabis is typically processed into <b>hashish.</b> This activity represents 0.57% of Morocco's GDP. A UN survey in 2003 estimated cannabis cultivation at about 1340km2 in Morocco's five northern provinces. This represented 10% of the total area and 23% of the arable lands of the surveyed territory and 1% of Morocco's total arable land.|$|E
25|$|It is in Venice that {{he first}} smoked <b>hashish</b> and, rather than studying, began {{to spend time}} frequenting disreputable parts of the city. The impact of these {{lifestyle}} choices upon his developing artistic style is open to conjecture, although these choices {{do seem to be}} more than simple teenage rebellion, or the cliched hedonism and bohemianism that was almost expected of artists of the time; his pursuit of the seedier side of life appears to have roots in his appreciation of radical philosophies, including those of Nietzsche.|$|E
25|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2003–2004 by Narcotics Control Bureau found that India {{has at least}} four million drug addicts. The most common drugs used in India are cannabis, <b>hashish,</b> opium and heroin. In 2006 alone, India's law enforcing agencies recovered 230kg heroin and 203kg of cocaine. In an annual government report in 2007, the United States named India among 20 major hubs for trafficking of illegal drugs along with Pakistan, Afghanistan and Burma. However, studies reveal {{that most of the}} criminals caught in this crime are either Nigerian or US nationals.|$|E
25|$|Agriculture employs about 40% of Morocco's workforce. In {{the rainy}} {{sections}} of the northeast, barley, wheat, and other cereals can be raised without irrigation. On the Atlantic coast, where there are extensive plains, olives, citrus fruits, and wine grapes are grown, largely with water supplied by artesian wells. Morocco also produces {{a significant amount of}} illicit <b>hashish,</b> much of which is shipped to Western Europe. Livestock are raised and forests yield cork, cabinet wood, and building materials. Part of the maritime population fishes for its livelihood. Agadir, Essaouira, El Jadida, and Larache are among the important fishing harbors.|$|E
25|$|Sandiford {{was convicted}} on 19 December, with a {{recommendation}} from prosecutors {{that she be}} spared the death penalty – the maximum punishment for drug trafficking under Indonesian law – because of her age and cooperation with police, and instead receive a 15-year custodial sentence. On the same day, Rachel Dougall {{was found guilty of}} failing to report a crime, while Paul Beales was convicted of possessing <b>hashish.</b> They later received one year and four-year prison sentences respectively. Julian Ponder was cleared of drug smuggling, but convicted of the possession of narcotics in January 2013, and sentenced to six years' imprisonment.|$|E
25|$|Hasheesh {{is indeed}} an accursed drug, {{and the soul}} at last pays a most bitter price for all its ecstasies; moreover, the use of {{it is not the}} proper means of gaining any insight, yet who shall say that at that season of exaltation I did not know things as they are more truly than ever in the {{ordinary}} state?.... In the jubilance of <b>hashish,</b> we have only arrived by an improper pathway at the secret of that infinity of beauty which shall be beheld in heaven and earth when the veil of the corporeal drops off, and we know as we are known.|$|E
25|$|As the Dubois Brothers {{continued}} to make money and become wealthier they realized that the highest profits were {{in the drug trade}} realizing that a drug, especially methamphetamine, were cheap enough to get and highly addictive and once a customer was hooked they could not resist coming back for more creating a customer base. One of their previous drug pushers stated that the Dubois Brothers could get a pound of marijuana for $30 imported from Mexico and were able to sell it on the streets for up to $750 making a major profit. The Dubois Brothers, more specifically Adrien, Claude and Roland, had branched off logically into drug trafficking in the mid 70s and were controlling, in the west end and city center of Montreal, the sales of marijuana, <b>hashish,</b> LSD, amphetamines, and cocaine. They had a web of dealers set up to distribute the drugs all of which were working in licensed establishments under the control of {{at least one of the}} Brothers. Montreal police were able to seize a drug distribution for the Dubois Brothers that consisted of nearly two million tenure pills in late 1973 to early 1974. The Brothers took it one step further by going continental when they began having roots in Pakistan because Adrien Dubois decided to introduce a Sixth Family associate to his impressive source of <b>hashish</b> through a corrupt government official in Pakistan who had a ministerial position and thrived for foreign currency. The Dubois Brothers were always thirsty for more territory and money and that is what lead them to the McSween Turf War.|$|E
25|$|A 2010 survey {{estimated}} about 46,000 {{hard drug}} {{users in the}} country, with 70% of the users to be within {{the age group of}} 15 to 29. The same survey also reported that 19% of the users had been introduced to hard drugs when they were less than 15 years old; and 14.4% of drug users were attending school or college. Only 12 of the 17 municipalities studied had any type of rehabilitation centre. There has been a sharp increase in the seizure of drugs such as <b>hashish,</b> heroin and opium in the past few years; and there are indications that drug traffickers are trying to establish Nepal as a transit point.|$|E
25|$|Cannabis sativa {{seeds are}} chiefly {{used to make}} {{hempseed}} oil {{which can be used}} for cooking, lamps, lacquers or paints. They can also be used as caged-bird feed, as they provide a moderate source of nutrients for most birds. The flowers (and to a lesser extent the leaves, stems, and seeds) contain psychoactive chemical compounds known as cannabinoids that are consumed for recreational, medicinal and spiritual purposes. When so used, preparations of flowers (marijuana) and leaves and preparations derived from resinous extract (e.g., <b>hashish)</b> are consumed by smoking, vaporising and oral ingestion. Historically, tinctures, teas and ointments have also been common preparations. In traditional medicine of India in particular C. sativa has been used as hallucinogenic, hypnotic, sedative, analgesic and anti-inflammatory agent.|$|E
25|$|Later {{the parties}} confer. The {{man in the}} teashop was Mr Lipscombe and when Miss Carnaby {{recognised}} him, she put on an act of allegiance to Andersen. Poirot realised this {{when he had the}} man followed back to the lodge. Andersen's chemistry background (although he was probably not a Jewish refugee) came in useful for preparing injections of <b>hashish</b> to produce ecstasy in his adherents, and also for injecting them with relevant bacteria when he wanted to kill them and inherit their estates. Andersen was about to inject Miss Carnaby with tuberculosis bacteria to tie in with the fictional ailment she told him about. The proof has been obtained in the laboratory in the sanctuary that the police have raided.|$|E
25|$|When {{analysing}} the Dutch model, both disadvantages and advantages can {{be drawn}} when comparing the results with other countries. On a moral argument, tolerating soft drugs {{can be seen as}} the defeat of the government against hedonism. Additionally, decades of growing and perfecting cannabis and <b>hashish</b> has resulted in increased levels of the main active hallucinogenic constituent tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), as levels have doubled, making the derived products more powerful, and therefore requiring less to achieve the desired effect. The coffee shop will lose its license if it caught selling to minors. Though there was a slight increase of use at the beginning, the rates balanced out some years later. The presence of coffee shops does not translate in public urge for experimentation. In fact, most people that did not consume drugs before the enhancement of the policy continue not to use them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} part of the ritual, the aides seek {{repeatedly}} both to arouse the ritualist sexually as well as to exhaust him. The ritualist is generally passive in this regard. There is disagreement over whether sexual arousal is enough, or sexual orgasm must be eventually accomplished. Crowley and others argue that orgasm must be avoided. Although later practitioners conclude that orgasm does not need to be avoided, that was how Crowley originally formulated the ritual. Most practitioners agree with Crowley that every means of arousal may be used, such as physical stimulation, genital stimulation, psychological stimulation, devices (such as sex toys), or drugs (an entheogen like <b>hashish,</b> marijuana, or other aphrodisiacs). There should be enough aides so that if one aide tires another may take his or her place. Eventually, the ritualist will tend to sink into sleep due to exhaustion.|$|E
25|$|The tough {{shell of}} secrecy that {{protected}} the Hells Angels for years finally cracked during {{an investigation that}} has resulted in the arrests of almost every member of the gang in Quebec. On April 15, 2009, operation SharQc was conducted by the provincial police force Sûreté du Québec. According to police, {{at the time it was}} the biggest strike at the HAMC in Canada's history and probably in all of HAMC's history. In all, 177 strikes were conducted by the police, 123 members were arrested, charged with for first-degree murder, attempted murder, gangsterism or drug trafficking. The police seized $5million in cash, dozens of kilograms of cocaine, marijuana and <b>hashish,</b> and thousands of pills. The operation was expected to lead to the closing of 22 unsolved murders. Operation SharQc involved a full-patch member of the gang turning informant, a very rare occurrence in Quebec.|$|E
