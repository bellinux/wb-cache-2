Marshall and Diggle state that the existence of some kind of non-random seed paternity is, in fact, not in question in flowering plants. It is how this occurs that remains unknown. Pollen choice is one of the possibilities, taking into account that 50% of the pollen grain’s haploid genome is expressed during its tube’s growth towards the ovule.|$|E

500|$|Verbal {{report is}} widely {{considered}} to be the most reliable indicator of consciousness, but it raises a number of issues.

[...] Daniel Dennett has argued for an approach he calls heterophenomenology, which means treating verbal reports as stories that may or may not be true, but his ideas about how to do this have not been widely adopted. [...] Another issue with verbal report as a criterion is that it restricts the field of study to humans who have language: [...] this approach cannot be used to study consciousness in other species, pre-linguistic children, or people with types of brain damage that impair language. [...] As a third issue, philosophers who dispute the validity of the Turing test may feel that it is possible, at least in principle, for verbal report to be dissociated from consciousness entirely: [...] a philosophical zombie may give detailed verbal reports of awareness in the absence of any genuine awareness.|$|E

The American Badger has been seen working with a coyote in tandem while hunting. Typically this pairing is one badger to one coyote, however, one study found about 9% of sightings included two coyotes to one badger, while 1% had one badger to three coyotes. Researchers have found that the coyote benefits by an increased catch rate of about 33%, and while it is <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> precisely <b>how</b> the badger benefits, the badger has been noted to spend more time underground and active. Badgers are also thought to expend less energy while hunting in burrows. According to research, this partnership works due to the different hunting styles of the predators and how they prey reacts to them. A ground squirrel, upon spotting a coyote, will crawl into its hole to escape; while upon seeing a badger, the ground squirrel will climb out of its hole and use its speed to out run the badger. Hunting in tandem raises the prey vulnerability and both predators win.|$|R

FPCA and clustering and Deming Regression highlight that the modelled and monitoring data appear not very well calibrated at Wellington Road, however these data are reasonably well calibrated at the other monitoring sites. FPCA and Clustering indicate that the roads appear to dominate and be the main cause of concern in Aberdeen in terms of air pollution. All methods suggest that between April 9 th and July 18 th the model and monitoring data appear not be well calibrated and this could be further explored to examine the potential causes.

One aim of policy, whether developed by a Government department or by a professional association or both, may be to promote efficiency, but not at the expense of individual discretion.
