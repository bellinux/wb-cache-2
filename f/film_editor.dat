5|$|Pre-{{production}} {{work began}} in December 2015. Shinde began {{working in the}} story at that time, and she chose Goa and Mumbai as the film's key locations. The production crew consisted primarily of people Shinde had worked with in English Vinglish, {{with the exception of}} production designer Rupin Suchakthey are <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> Hemanti Sarkar; dialogue team Krishna Hariharan, Gauri Shinde and Kausar Munir; and cinematographer Laxman Utekar.|$|E
5|$|After {{the release}} of Licence to Kill, legal wrangling {{over control of the}} series and the James Bond {{character}} resulted in a six-year delay before production of the next Bond film which resulted in Dalton deciding not to return. It is also the final Bond film for actors Robert Brown (as M) and Caroline Bliss (as Moneypenny), screenwriter Richard Maibaum, title designer Maurice Binder, editor John Grover, cinematographer Alec Mills, director and former Bond <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> John Glen, and producer Albert R. Broccoli, although he would later act as a consulting producer for GoldenEye before his death.|$|E
5|$|For Your Eyes Only {{marked a}} change in the {{production}} crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies from Heaven, Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.|$|E

5|$|In August 2005, a 25th-anniversary {{celebration for}} The Blues Brothers {{was held at}} Grauman's Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles. Attendees {{included}} Landis, former Universal Studios executive Thom Mount, <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> George Folsey, Jr., and cast members James Brown, Henry Gibson, Charles Napier, Steve Cropper, and Stephen Bishop. It featured a press conference, a panel discussion where Dan Aykroyd joined by satellite, and a screening of the original theatrical version of the film. The panel discussion was broadcast direct to many other cinemas around the country.|$|E
5|$|Ray's regular <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> was Dulal Datta, but the {{director}} usually dictated the editing while Datta did the actual work. Because of financial reasons and Ray's meticulous planning, his films were mostly cut in-camera (apart from Pather Panchali). At {{the beginning of}} his career, Ray worked with Indian classical musicians, including Ravi Shankar, Vilayat Khan, and Ali Akbar Khan. He found that their first loyalty was to musical traditions, and not to his film. He had a greater understanding of Western classical forms, which he wanted to use for his films set in an urban milieu. Starting with Teen Kanya, Ray began to compose his own scores.|$|E
5|$|The trailer piqued the {{interest}} of Twitch <b>Film</b> <b>editor</b> Todd Brown, who inquired if the project had entered production. When Matti {{told him that the}} film did not yet have a screenplay, Brown encouraged him to write it while he looked for investors for financing. On the script's ninth revision, screenwriter Michiko Yamamotoknown for films such as Magnifico (2004) and Ang Pagdadalaga ni Maximo Oliveros (2006)came on board to help finalize the remainder of the draft. Four uncredited consultants were also hired to develop details in the story.|$|E

The film was later re-cut in Rome by one of John Huston's favorite <b>film</b> <b>editors,</b> Russell Lloyd, but Simon believes more funny bits [...] "are lying in a cutting room in Italy".

5|$|Fields' {{career as}} a <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> {{commenced}} in 1960, when the director Irving Lerner recruited her to be {{the editor of the}} film Studs Lonigan; Fields and Lerner had both worked on The Savage Eye. In 1963 she edited An Affair of the Skin, which was directed by Ben Maddow (another Savage Eye contact). Over the next five years, Fields edited several other independent films; the best known is The Legend of the Boy and the Eagle (1967), which was shown on the television program Walt Disney's Wonderful World of Color. She also made documentaries funded by the United States government through the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), the United States Information Agency (USIA), and the U.S. Department of Health, Education, and Welfare (HEW).|$|E
5|$|It is {{the only}} Bond film to be {{directed}} by Peter R. Hunt, who {{had served as a}} <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> and second unit director on previous films in the series. Hunt, along with producers Albert R. Broccoli and Harry Saltzman, decided to produce a more realistic film that would follow the novel closely. It was shot in Switzerland, England, and Portugal from October 1968 to May 1969. Although its cinema release was not as lucrative as its predecessor You Only Live Twice, On Her Majesty's Secret Service was still one of the top performing films of the year. Critical reviews upon release were mixed, but the film's reputation has improved greatly over time.|$|E
5|$|Money No Enough was {{produced}} by JSP Films on a budget of S$850,000. The production crew included Deri Ng as first assistant director, J.P. Tan as producer, Kamis as cinematographer, A. Supranamian as <b>film</b> <b>editor,</b> Anthony Ng as art director and Abdul Shukar Mohd as sound designer. Filming was plagued by financial problems, such as poor quality shooting equipment. After the Board of Film Censors reviewed and approved Money No Enough, distributor Shaw Organisation released the film on 21 screens on 7 May 1998 and 18 April 2008. The success of the movie led to a dispute between Neo and Producer over their shares of the profits. To mark its tenth anniversary, Money No Enough was released in cinemas again and {{was followed by a}} sequel, Money No Enough 2.|$|E

5000|$|The Guild {{was formed}} by some 40 British <b>Film</b> <b>Editors</b> in 1966. Originally named the Guild of British <b>Film</b> <b>Editors</b> (GBFE), as more {{television}} programmes - particularly dramas and drama series - were pre-recorded rather than broadcast live its membership very soon included editors working in television as well. In 2005, when the advance of digital recording and editing meant that very few editors were actually working with film at all, the name was changed to the Guild of British <b>Film</b> and Television <b>Editors.</b> At {{the same time the}} motto “Crafting the Moving Image” was added to the logo to reflect these changes.|$|R
5|$|Roger Stevens {{was working}} for the BBC as a <b>film</b> <b>editor</b> in the 1980s, and one morning, as he was {{travelling}} to work by train, he bumped into a BBC co-worker and they began to talk about Doctor Who episodes. The BBC projectionist mentioned that he had nine episodes of Doctor Who that Stevens could buy for £25. In the summer of 1981, Stevens bought The Space Museum episode one, The Abominable Snowmen episode two, The Moonbase episode four, Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one, and three episodes of Carnival of Monsters. Stevens then contacted Ian Levine {{to find out what was}} missing from the BBC archive; Levine confirmed that The Abominable Snowmen episode two and Invasion of the Dinosaurs episode one were currently missing.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} crew included Titus Ho as executive producer; Chan Pui Yin and Daniel Yun as producers; Kane Chen as cinematographer and Lawrence Ang as <b>film</b> <b>editor.</b> In addition to writing and directing, Neo also penned {{the lyrics to}} the theme song, which was sung by Koh Mei Xian and composed by Li Yi. Filming {{took place in the}} rural outskirts of Kuala Lumpur during November and December 2002. The cast endured a rigorous schedule, including extensive travel times to the filming location and many running scenes. The child actors' school commitments made the planning of reshoots difficult; moreover, the production team decided to delay post-production work in Thailand due to the SARS outbreak.|$|E
5|$|The {{script for}} Danger: Diabolik {{was written by}} Dino Maiuri, Tudor Gates, Brian Degas, and Bava. The {{screenplay}} was adapted from three different Diabolik stories: Sepolto vivo! ("Buried Alive!") from August 1963, Lotta disperata ("Desperate Fight") from March 1964, and L'ombra nella notte ("Shadow In The Night") from May 1965. Like Law, Degas and Gates had also worked on Barbarellla. <b>Film</b> <b>editor</b> Romana Fortini and cinematographer Antonio Rinaldi were also brought in, having worked with Bava on his previous films such as Planet of the Vampires and Kill, Baby, Kill. Other crew members included future Academy Award winners, such as set designer Carlo Rambaldi (E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial) and composer Ennio Morricone (The Hateful Eight).|$|E
