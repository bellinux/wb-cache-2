2500|$|Today I sent my Annual Message to the Congress, as {{required}} by the Constitution. It has been my custom to deliver these Annual Messages in person, and they have been broadcast to the Nation. I intended to follow this same custom this year. But like a great many other people, I have had the [...] "flu", and although I am practically recovered, my doctor simply would not let me leave the White House {{to go up to the}} Capitol. Only a few of the newspapers of the United States can print the Message in full, and I am anxious that the American people be given an opportunity to hear what I have recommended to the Congress for this very fateful year in our history — and the reasons for those recommendations. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> said … ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I neither admit {{anything}} nor deny anything,’ I returned. ‘But if {{this form}} of words will suffice you, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> say: I give you my parole, as a gentleman and a soldier, there has nothing taken place amongst us prisoners that was not honourable as the day.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|From these {{delicate}} and choice writers I turned with some curiosity to a {{player of the}} big drum--Macaulay. I had in hand the two- volume edition, and I opened {{at the beginning of}} the second volume. <b>Here</b> <b>was</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> read: ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thou speakest {{rather as}} a philosopher than as a {{penitent}} Catholic. For me, I feel that I want to look more, and not less, inward. Deeper self-examination, completer abstraction, than I can attain even <b>here,</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> crave for. I long--forgive me, my friend--but I long more and more, daily, for the solitary life. This earth is accursed by man's sin: the less we see of it, it seems to me, the better.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Merton blushed. 'If you are right,' he said, 'then I have no {{business}} to <b>be</b> <b>here.</b> <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> {{in the eyes of}} a man like Mr. Macrae? An adventurer, that <b>is</b> <b>what</b> he would think me. I did think that I had done nothing, said nothing, looked nothing, but having the chance--well, I could not keep away from her. It is not honourable. I must go. [...] . I love her.' ...|$|R
60|$|Friedrich's Journey to Pyrmont is {{the first}} thing {{recorded}} of him by the Newspapers. Gone to take the waters; as he did after his former War. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> had noted of that small Occurrence, and of one or two others contiguous in date, which prove to be of significance in Friedrich's History.|$|E
6000|$|The same marks, plain cups, {{cups and}} rings, spirals, {{concentric}} circles, horseshoes, medial lines with short slanting lines proceeding from them, like the branches on a larch, or {{the spine of}} a fish, occur on the rocks of the Arunta hills, and also on plaques of stone cherished and called churinga ("sacred") by the Arunta. {78} <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call [...] "parallelism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No, not {{anything}} to drink, thank you; it isn't very long since breakfast,' said Caterina, drawing out the comforter from her deep pocket. Pockets were capacious in those days. 'Look here, uncle Bates, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> came to bring you. I made {{it on purpose}} for you. You must wear it this winter, and give your red one to old Brooks.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{contained}} a false bottom, and <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> found in it. I stowed them {{away in a}} secret drawer in that old cabinet that stands by my bedside. It is in the bottom pigeonhole on the right hand side. I bought the cabinet at a sale, and found the spring of the secret drawer quite accidentally. I shall put the things back tonight, and you will {{know where to look}} for them. You press against the bottom and up against the top simultaneously, and the back then falls forward. The opening behind is very shallow, and will hold but two or three letters. But, however, it sufficed for this;" [...] and he handed Mark the coin and slip of paper.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only knew}} {{her as a}} pale, shy young girl who went in and out, and seldom spoke to any one. Mrs. Finn {{told me she was}} poor, but a busy, honest, little thing, who did n't mix with the other folks, but lived and worked alone. 'She has looked so down-hearted and pale for a week, that I thought she was sick, and asked her about it,' said Mrs. Finn, 'but she thanked me in her bashful way, and said she was pretty well, so I let her alone. But to-night, as I went up late to bed, I was kind of {{impressed}} to look in and see how the poor thing did, for she had n't left her room all day. I did look in, and <b>here</b> <b>'s</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> found.' As Mrs. Finn ended she opened the door of the back attic, and I saw about as sad a sight as these old eyes ever looked at." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for that," [...] sighed Cis, [...] "I {{never know}} <b>what</b> <b>is</b> sooth <b>here,</b> and <b>what</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> save a living lie myself? O Humfrey! I am so weary of it all." ...|$|R
6000|$|<b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> {{have seen}} printed {{regarding}} the matter, and I will copy it lest any one think I may have imagined {{some portion of}} this contention, which, {{as we look at}} the situation now, seems so improbable, for one can hardly believe that any officer in the patriot army would have refused at such a time to aid those who were so sorely pressed as were Gansevoort's troops: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But Jasper is not useless--would not {{be useless}} when {{out of sight}} of land," [...] said Mabel, with a spirit and energy that caused her clear sweet voice to be startling amid the solemn stillness of that {{extraordinary}} scene. [...] "No one can be useless there who can do so much <b>here,</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> mean; though, I daresay, he is not as well acquainted with ships as my uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|As I write, now, {{many months}} later, I {{perceive}} {{that each of}} us, by observing and noting and inquiring, diligently and day by day, had managed to lay in a most varied and opulent stock of misinformation. But this is not surprising; {{it is very difficult}} to get accurate details in any country. For example, I had the idea once, in Heidelberg, to find out all about those five student-corps. I started with the White Cap corps. I began to inquire of this and that and the other citizen, and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> found out: ...|$|E
2500|$|Popović {{returned}} to Belgrade in 2001 after {{the overthrow of}} Milošević. Explaining why he decided to come back rather than remain living in New York, he said: [...] "My children had grown, completed their schooling, I saw they no longer needed me. I spent my entire life <b>here,</b> this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> know. I communicate with these people much easier as similar things interest us. No one in America cares about Tuđman and Milošević".|$|R
6000|$|... "But, my dear madam," [...] said I, [...] "you don't {{want me to}} go to the town, and you won't {{allow me}} to have any cooking done <b>here.</b> <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> to do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Was it here {{while waiting}} about Meissen, or where was it, that Daun got his Letter to Fermor {{answered}} in that singular way? The Letter {{of two weeks}} ago,--carried by Loudon's Hussars, or by whomsoever,--for certain, it was retorted or returned upon Daun; not as if from the Dead-Letter Office, but with an Answer he little expected! <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> record <b>I</b> have; very vague for a well-known little fact of sparkling nature:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|When I {{started to}} write this note my wife came up and stood looking over my shoulder. Women always {{want to know what}} is going on. Said she [...] "Should not that read in the third person?" [...] I conceded that it should, put aside what I was writing, and {{commenced}} over again. That seemed to satisfy her, and so she sat down and let me proceed. I then--finished my first note--and so sent what I intended. I never could have done this if I had let my wife know the truth about it. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wrote: ...|$|E
6000|$|Even if I {{had been}} treated kindly, I should {{certainly}} not have taken the money {{when there was a}} relative living with a claim to it. What did I want with a large fortune! To buy a husband with it, perhaps? No, no! from all that I have heard, the great Lord Chancellor was quite right when he said that a woman with money at her own disposal was [...] "either kissed out of it or kicked out of it, six weeks after her marriage." [...] The one difficulty before me was not to give up my legacy, but to express my reply with sufficient severity, {{and at the same time}} with due regard to my own self-respect. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> wrote: ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘You {{should have}} let me finish,’ she returned, smiling. ‘Do you suppose I did not mention her on purpose? You know you had lost your head. Well, so had I. Come now, do not be abashed by words,’ she added {{somewhat}} sharply. ‘It {{is the one thing}} I despise. If you are not a fool, you will see that I am building fortresses about your virtue. And at any rate, I choose that you shall understand that I am not dying of love for you. It is a very smiling business; no tragedy for me! And now <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> have to say about your wife; she is not and she never has been Gondremark’s mistress. Be sure he would have boasted if she had. Good-night!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "At lunch? Well, I don't know. Look <b>here,</b> mother. <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> {{to say to}} Miss Robarts when I see her?" [...] and {{he leaned}} with {{his back against the}} chimney-piece as he interrogated his mother.|$|R
6000|$|Then {{he studied}} {{the first of the}} {{markings}} and asked: [...] "What <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for? <b>What</b> <b>am</b> <b>I</b> <b>here</b> for? Does he who sits upon the Throne desire to know how long he has to reign?" ...|$|R
60|$|There is no {{need for}} me to add more to these few prefatory words than <b>is</b> <b>here</b> written. <b>What</b> <b>I</b> might {{otherwise}} have wished to say in this place, I have endeavored to make the book itself say for me.|$|R
6000|$|Ferdinand, strong only as one to two, cannot hinder Broglio, {{though he}} tries variously; and is much at a loss, seeing Broglio irrepressibly busy this way, all through August {{and on into}} September;--has heard, however, from Wesel, through secret partisans there, that Wesel, {{considered}} altogether out of risk, is left in a very weak condition; weak in garrison, weak even in gunners. Reflecting upon which, in his difficulties, Ferdinand asks himself, [...] "A sudden stroke at Wesel, 200 miles away, might it not astonish Broglio, who is so busy on us just here?"--and, September 22d, despatches the Hereditary Prince on that errand. A man likely for it, if there be one in the world:--unable to do it, however, as the issue told. <b>Here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> find noted.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{should have}} let me finish," [...] she returned, smiling. [...] "Do you suppose I did not mention her on purpose? You know you had lost your head. Well, so had I.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said George, who had {{glanced over}} the {{contents}} of the particular paper which had caused him so much surprise, [...] "listen to me. In the first place, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should judge to be an accurate survey of the wood-lot Ralph and I bought of Simpson. It states the price for which the land was mortgaged, and the probable price for which it could be bonded or purchased. Here is a description of the entire property, and here is given the exact spot, by measurement, where they have found satisfactory evidences of oil. It would be singular if, in helping Mr. Simpson, we had helped ourselves, and still more singular that we should learn of it through those who stole my team, and put us to so much trouble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{dear old}} soul," [...] said Archie, [...] "in the recent unpleasantness in France I had chappies popping off {{things like that}} at me all day and every day for close on five years, and <b>here</b> <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>what!</b> <b>I</b> mean to say, if I've got to choose between staying here and being pinched in your room by the local constabulary and having the dashed thing get into the papers {{and all sorts of}} trouble happening, and my wife getting the wind up and--I say, if I've got to choose--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘At {{the same}} time,’ I said, ‘I {{have had an}} accident: I have unhappily lost my baggage, and <b>am</b> <b>here</b> in <b>what</b> <b>I</b> stand in. I don’t know if the doctor be a formalist, but it is quite {{impossible}} I should appear at table as I ought.’ ...|$|R
6000|$|The general Secret of Prussian Thrift, I do fear, is {{lost from}} the world. And how an Army of about 200,000, in field and garrison, could be kept on foot, {{and in some}} ability to front {{combined}} Europe, on about Three Million Sterling annually ("25 million THALERS"=3,150,000 pounds, that is the steady War-Budget of those years), remains to us inconceivable enough;--mournfully miraculous, as it were; and growing ever more so in the Nugget-generations that now run. Meanwhile, <b>here</b> <b>are</b> <b>what</b> hints <b>I</b> could find, on the Origins of that modest Sum, which also are a wonder: [Preuss, ii. 388-392; Stenzel, v. 137-141.]-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So am I, at all events," [...] said she. [...] "I {{have seen}} you {{but a small}} time, but I put you very high. You are true, you are brave; in time I think you will {{be more of a}} man yet. I will be proud to hear of that. If you should speed worse, if it will come to fall as we are afraid--O well! think you have the one friend. Long after you are dead and me an old wife, I will be telling the bairns about David Balfour, and my tears running. I will be telling how we parted, and what I said to you, and did to you. God go with you and guide you, prays your little friend: so I said--I will be telling them--and <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{had thought}} so. It cannot be as you propose. I shall never speak of your sister to a living man. I shall never whisper {{a word of}} her regard even here in her own family. But I cannot change my heart as you propose. Your sister is beautiful, and sweet, and good; {{but she is not}} the girl who has crept into my heart, and made a lasting home for herself there,--if the girl who has done so would but accept it. Ada is not the girl whose brightness, whose bravery, whose wit and ready spirit have won me. These things go, I think, without any effort. I have known that there has been no attempt on your part; but the thing has been done and I had hoped that you were aware of it. It cannot now be undone. I cannot be passed on to another. Here, here, <b>here</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want," [...] and he put his two hands upon her shoulders. [...] "There is no other girl in all Ireland that can supply her place if she be lost to me." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, come, {{this is a}} nice bit, now. I did {{a little}} in this way myself at one time, you know. Look <b>here,</b> now; this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> call a nice thing, done with what we used to call brio." [...] Mr. Brooke held out towards the two girls a large colored sketch of stony ground and trees, with a pool.|$|R
500|$|In 1917, Jolin {{rented a}} studio at Kungsbroplan in Stockholm and painted diligently. At {{the end of}} that year he was visited by Herman Gotthardt, a {{wholesaler}} from Malmö, who had recently taken up art collecting as a hobby. He studied Jolin's numerous works and, as at this time the artists sold very few paintings, it came as a surprise to him when Gotthardt bought 16 canvases. Jolin received seven thousand crowns (sek) for the paintings, and at home the same evening he was able to show his parents the money from his first major sales, saying: [...] "Look <b>here,</b> this <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> earned today".|$|R
6000|$|... "You need have no fear," [...] he told her. [...] "With politics--I have finished. Why <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here,</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>here</b> for I {{will tell}} you very soon. It is to find one whom I have lost--and who is dear to me. Forgive me if for to-day I say no more. Come, if you will you shall drive me to my hotel." ...|$|R
