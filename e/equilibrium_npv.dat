40|$|This paper expands on {{the results}} {{obtained}} in Magni (2009) regarding investment decisions with the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). It is shown that four different decision criteria are deductively drawn from this model: the disequilibrium Net Present Value (NPV), the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>NPV,</b> the disequilibrium Net Future Value (NFV), and the equilibrium NFV. It is shown {{that all of them}} may be used for accept-reject decisions, but only the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>NPV</b> and the disequilibrium NFV may be used for valuation, given that they have the additivity property. However, it is possible to deductively dismiss the two nonadditive indexes if the ‘accept/reject’ problem is reframed as a choice among mutually exclusive alternatives. As for the remaining (additive) measures, the <b>equilibrium</b> <b>NPV</b> and the disequilibrium NFV are unreliable for both valuation and decision, because despite their additivity, they do not signal arbitrage opportunities whenever there is some state of nature for which they are decreasing functions with respect to the end-of-period cash flow. In this case, the equilibrium value of a project is not the price it would have if it was traded in the security market. This result is the capital-budgeting counterpart of Dybvig and Ingersoll’s (1982) result...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{reliable}} {{separation of}} neptunium from dissolved nuclear fuel assumes {{the ability to}} maintain a preferred oxidation state. However, regardless of its initial redox speciation, a series of reactions occurs in nitric acid to create a mixture of oxidation states including Np(V), Np(VI) and sometimes Np(IV). To further complicate the situation, irradiated solutions such as fuel dissolution contain both transient and long-lived radiolysis products which may be strongly oxidizing or reducing. Thus, irradiation {{may be expected to}} impact the equilibrium distributions of the various neptunium valences. We have irradiated nitric acid solutions of neptunium with 60 Co gamma-rays, and measured radiolytically-induced changes in neptunium valences, as well as the nitrous acid concentration, by UV/Vis spectroscopy. It was found that in 4 M HNO 3 at low absorbed doses, the oxidizing radicals oxidized Np(V) to Np(VI). However, as the irradiation proceeded the concentration of nitrous acid became sufficient to reduce Np(VI) to Np(V), and then continued irradiation favored this reduction until an equilibrium was achieved in balance with the oxidation of Np(V) by nitric acid itself. The starting abundances of the two neptunium valences did not affect the final <b>equilibrium</b> concentrations of <b>Np(V)</b> and Np(VI), and no Np(IV) was detected...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – In {{investment}} decision making, the {{net present value}} (NPV) rule is often used alongside the well-known capital asset pricing model (CAPM). In particular, the use of disequilibrium NPV is endorsed in corporate finance for both valuation and decision. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to test the reliability of this approach to capital budgeting valuations and decisions. Design/methodology/approach – The use of disequilibrium values for computing a project’s NPV is considered, and the consistency with the CAPM is checked. The resulting valuation and decision arecontrasted with the no-arbitrage principle, which is universally considered a benchmark for rationality. Findings – The paper finds that the disequilibrium NPV is logically deducted from the CAPM for decision-making purposes. However, this NPV provides nonadditive values, which makes it inconsistent with the no-arbitrage principle. Practical implications – The use of the CAPM þ NPV procedure for valuing projects is invalid if disequilibrium values are used. Its use for decision making is logically valid but practically unsafe,because decision makers may frame equivalent courses of action in different ways, resulting in different decisions, which implies that they may incur arbitrage losses. Originality/value – The literature does not distinguish between <b>equilibrium</b> and disequilibrium <b>NPV</b> nor between valuation and decision. This paper explicitly makes this distinction and the resulting consequences are highlighted. Paper type - Research pape...|$|R

Thus, irradiation {{may be expected to}} impact the equilibrium distributions of the various neptunium valences. Among the transient products of the irradiation of aqueous nitric acid are the reducing •H atom and solvated electron (e-aq) and the oxidizing •OH radical from water radiolysis, and the oxidizing •NO 3 and •NO 2 radicals from nitric acid radiolysis. Longer-lived radiolysis products include hydrogen peroxide from water radiolysis and nitrous acid from nitric acid radiolysis. It has long been known that HNO 2 acts as a reducing agent toward Np(VI); however, the effects of the oxidizing transient species have been less well studied. Here we have irradiated nitric acid solutions of neptunium with 60 Co gamma-rays, and measured radiolytically-induced changes in neptunium valences, as well as the nitrous acid concentration, by UV/Vis spectroscopy.
