5|$|Chamberlin was a {{prolific}} taxonomist of invertebrate animals who named and described over 4,000 species, {{specializing in the}} study of arachnids (spiders, scorpions, and their relatives), and myriapods (millipedes, centipedes, and relatives), but also publishing on molluscs, marine worms, and insects. By 1941 he <b>had</b> <b>described</b> at least 2,000 species, and by 1957 <b>had</b> <b>described</b> a total of 4,225 new species, 742 new genera, 28 new families, and 12 orders.

5|$|However, Ruiz died in Valparaíso, Chile {{soon after}} his arrival in the country. He {{reportedly}} had uremia and a urethral obstruction, both of which deteriorated into Fournier gangrene, which killed him soon after. Later speculation that Ruiz had been poisoned or killed has been countered by three facts: that Ruiz's brother, Mariano Ruiz Quiñones (who was the coordinator of the revolution in Curaçao), died of the same condition soon after (suggesting a genetic predisposition to it), that Betances had used a catheter on Ruiz before he left Saint Thomas to bring him some relief from his condition, and that Betances published a medical article in France twenty years later, in 1887, that discussed the condition, out of what he <b>had</b> <b>described</b> as many years of second-guessing {{what could have been}} done to save Ruiz's life.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 Elmer Riggs {{published}} {{a study that}} described a well-preserved skeleton of a diplodocid from the Grand River Valley near Fruita, Colorado, Field Museum of Natural History specimen P25112. Riggs thought that the deposits were similar in age {{to those of the}} Como Bluff in Wyoming from which Marsh <b>had</b> <b>described</b> Brontosaurus. Most of the skeleton was found, and after comparison with both Brontosaurus and Apatosaurus ajax, Riggs realized that the holotype of A.ajax was immature, and thus the features distinguishing the genera were not valid. Since Apatosaurus was the earlier name, Brontosaurus should be considered a junior synonym of Apatosaurus. Because of this, Riggs recombined Brontosaurus excelsus as Apatosaurus excelsus. Based on comparisons with other species proposed to belong to Apatosaurus, Riggs also determined that the Field Columbian Museum specimen was likely most similar to A.excelsus.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, {{dermatologist}} Frederick Parkes Weber {{wrote an}} article about von Recklinghausen disease in the British Journal of Dermatology. erroneously citing Merrick {{as an example of}} the disease, which German pathologist Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen <b>had</b> <b>described</b> in 1882, but in the last year has been found that this conjecture was wrong. In fact, symptoms that are always present in this genetic disorder include tumours of the nervous tissue and bones, small warty growths on the skin, and (which is a peculiar characteristic of this disease) the presence of light brown pigmentation on the skin called café au lait spots.; however, these spots were never observed on Merrick's body. For this reason, although this diagnosis was quite popular through most of the 20th century, other conjectural diagnosis were advanced, such as those of who suffer Maffucci syndrome and polyostotic fibrous dysplasia (Albright's disease).|$|E

5|$|In 1974, Ostrom {{published}} another monograph on {{the shoulder}} of Deinonychus in which he realized that the pubis that he <b>had</b> <b>described</b> was actually a coracoid– a shoulder element. In that same year, another specimen of Deinonychus, MCZ 4371, was discovered and excavated in Montana by Steven Orzack during a Harvard University expedition headed by Farish Jenkins. This discovery added several new elements: well preserved femurs, pubes, a sacrum, and better ilia, as well as elements of the pes and metatarsus. Ostrom described this specimen and revised his skeletal restoration of Deinonychus. This time it showed the very long pubis, and Ostrom began to suspect that they may have even been a little retroverted like those of birds.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, Hergé became {{increasingly}} annoyed at {{the success of}} René Goscinny and Albert Uderzo's Asterix comic book series, which various commentators <b>had</b> <b>described</b> as eclipsing The Adventures of Tintin as the foremost comic in the Franco-Belgian tradition. Hoping to imitate {{the success of the}} recent animated films Asterix the Gaul (1967) and Asterix and Cleopatra (1968), Hergé agreed to the production of two animated Belvision films based on the Adventures of Tintin. The first, Tintin and the Temple of the Sun (1969), was based on pre-existing comics, whereas the second, Tintin and the Lake of Sharks (1972) was an original story written by Greg. In 1982 the American filmmaker Steven Spielberg requested the film rights for a live-action adaptation of one of The Adventures of Tintin, a prospect that excited Hergé, but the project never came to fruition at the time.|$|E
5|$|Norris had {{similarly}} scouted {{settings for}} his novel and chose the upstairs {{of a building}} {{on the corner of}} Polk and California street as McTeague's dentist office, as well as many of the saloons and lunch counters in the area. Stroheim discovered that many of the locations that Norris <b>had</b> <b>described,</b> such as Polk Street, had been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, but he was able to find suitable period locations on Hayes and Laguna streets. For authenticity, Stroheim had no sets built in San Francisco and only redecorated existing locations, such as saloons, butcher shops, and wooden shacks, thus saving on construction costs.|$|E

5|$|Some mycologists {{classify}} C.violaceus as {{two distinct}} species—Cortinarius violaceus and Cortinarius hercynicus, with hercynicus {{relating to the}} Hercynian Forest region of southern Germany.

Persoon <b>had</b> <b>described</b> C.hercynicus as a separate species in 1794, though Fries regarded it as conspecific with C.violaceus. Moser separated them once again as species in 1967, and Norwegian biologist Tor Erik Brandrud classified C.hercynicus as a subspecies of C.violaceus in 1983. However, Harrower and colleagues, on limited molecular testing, found no genetic or ecological {{difference between the two}} taxa.|$|E
5|$|The Athenians now {{ended their}} {{alliance}} with the Ionians, since the Persians had proved {{to be anything but}} the easy prey that Aristagoras <b>had</b> <b>described.</b> However, the Ionians remained committed to their rebellion and the Persians did not seem to follow up their victory at Ephesus. Presumably these ad hoc forces were not equipped to lay siege to any of the cities. Despite the defeat at Ephesus, the revolt actually spread further. The Ionians sent men to the Hellespont and Propontis and captured Byzantium and the other nearby cities. They also persuaded the Carians to join the rebellion. Furthermore, seeing the spread of the rebellion, the kingdoms of Cyprus also revolted against Persian rule without any outside persuasion.|$|E
