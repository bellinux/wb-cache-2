However, these concoctions were deliberately never made fatal enough to cause death. [...] These <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> mostly depended on the fear of Takhar as dispenser of justice and vengeance, than their poisons.|$|R

50|$|The main cult of Ra was {{in ancient}} Heliopolis, {{northeast}} of present-day Cairo. The <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> of Ra {{are not as}} well documented as the <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> of other deities such as Amun and Ptah.|$|R
50|$|The {{family tree}} of the Twenty-first dynasty was heavily {{interconnected}} {{with the family}} of the <b>High</b> <b>Priests</b> of Amun at Thebes. The Twenty-second dynasty and Twenty-third dynasty were also related by marriage to {{the family of the}} <b>High</b> <b>Priests.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Theban <b>High</b> <b>Priests</b> of Amun While not {{regarded}} as a dynasty, the <b>High</b> <b>Priests</b> of Amun at Thebes were nevertheless of such power and influence that they were effectively the rulers of Upper Egypt from 1080 to c. 943 BC ...|$|R
5|$|The <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> of {{the temple}} of Anhur at Thinis was called the first prophet, or chief of seers, a title that Maspero (1903) {{suggests}} {{is a reflection of}} Thinis' decline in status as a city.|$|E

The <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> is chosen among fourth or higher degree members by the chairman of the Council of Nine. This ruling council has nine members chosen from the priesthood (third degree or higher), whose mandate lasts for nine years with a new member being elected every year. The chairman of the council is chosen from among the council members each year. The council has the ultimate ruling power in the Temple and even the <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> is responsible to it. The Temple also has an executive director, whose task is to deal with administrative issues.|$|E

5000|$|Like other priesthood {{offices in}} the LDS Church, <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> are {{organized}} into quorums. The <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> quorum is organized at the stake level, {{with the president of}} the quorum being the stake president. (In contrast, priesthood quorums for the offices of deacon, teacher, priest, and elder are organized at the ward level.) In consultation with the bishop, the stake president organizes a <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> [...] "group" [...] in each ward. Each group is provided with a group leader, who typically selects two assistants and a secretary to assist him. Assignments made to the group include home teaching and assisting adult males who are not yet elders prepare to receive the Melchizedek priesthood. <b>High</b> <b>priests</b> are also responsible for temple and family history work within a ward.|$|R
50|$|All {{adult men}} in the ward, whether they are {{faithful}} or not, are assigned to either the elders quorum or the <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> group, as directed by the bishop. However, ordained elders and <b>high</b> <b>priests</b> are assigned by default to the quorum or group consistent with their ordination.|$|R

5|$|Many {{scholars}} have gleaned from this passage that the Wicked Priest and the Teacher of Righteousness followed different liturgical calendars, thus enabling the Wicked Priest {{to travel on}} Yom Kippur; some have even suggested that the Teacher of Righteousness was a schismatic <b>High</b> <b>Priest</b> during the pre-Jonathan intersacerdotium.|$|E
5|$|Other scholars, however, {{argue that}} {{hereditary}} illegitimacy is not listed among the indiscretions of the Wicked Priest, {{and that this}} interpretation has been foisted upon the text by decades of questionable interpretation. Collins argues further {{that there is no}} evidence in the Community Rule or the Damascus Document to support the view that the Qumran community was concerned with the legitimacy of a non-Zadokite <b>High</b> <b>Priest.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{scholars}} {{argue that}} there is no one <b>High</b> <b>Priest</b> who is the strongest candidate for identification with each of the Wicked Priest passages. The different demises of the Wicked Priest and the tenses associated with them are often cited as evidence of the impossibility of a single Wicked Priest.|$|E

5|$|Some priests' duties {{took them}} beyond the temple precinct. They formed {{part of the}} entourage in festivals that {{traveled}} from one temple to another, and clergies {{from around the country}} sent representatives to the national sed festival that reinforced the king's divine power. Some temples, such as those in the neighboring cities of Memphis and Letopolis, were overseen by the same <b>high</b> <b>priest.</b>|$|E

5|$|At {{certain times}} {{there was an}} {{administrative}} office that presided over all temples and clergies. In the Old Kingdom, pharaohs gave this authority first to their relatives and then to their viziers. In the reign of Thutmose III the office passed from the viziers to the High Priests of Amun, who held it {{for much of the}} New Kingdom. The Romans established a similar office, that of the <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> for all Egypt, which oversaw the temple cults until their extinction.|$|E
5|$|Following {{initiation}} {{into the}} Temple, a Setian can proceed along {{a series of}} six degrees, each of which requires greater responsibilities to the group; as a result, most members remain {{in the first two}} degrees. Governed by a <b>high</b> <b>priest</b> or high priestess and a wider Council of Nine, the Temple is also divided into groups known as pylons, through which Setians can meet or correspond in order to advance their magical work in a particular area. Pylons of the Temple are now present in the United States, Australia, and Europe, with estimates placing the Temple's membership between 200 and 500.|$|E
