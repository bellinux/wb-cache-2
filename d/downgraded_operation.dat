40|$|Abstract. Disjunction Category Labels (DC-labels) are an {{expressive}} label format used {{to classify}} {{the sensitivity of}} data in information-flow control systems. DC-labels use capability-like privileges to downgrade information. Inappropriate use of privileges can compromise security, but DC-labels provide no mechanism to ensure appropriate use. We extend DC-labels with the novel notions of bounded privileges and robust priv-ileges. Bounded privileges specify and enforce {{upper and lower bounds}} on the labels of data that may be downgraded. Bounded privileges are simple and intuitive, yet can express a rich set of desirable security poli-cies. Robust privileges can be used only in <b>downgrading</b> <b>operations</b> that are robust, i. e., the code exercising privileges cannot be abused to release or certify more information than intended. Surprisingly, robust down-grades can be expressed in DC-labels as <b>downgrading</b> <b>operations</b> using a weakened privilege. We provide sound and complete run-time security checks to ensure <b>downgrading</b> <b>operations</b> are robust. We illustrate the applicability of bounded and robust privileges in a case study as well as by identifying a vulnerability in an existing DC-label-based application. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Data {{sanitization}} {{has been}} studied {{in the context of}} architectures for high assurance systems, language-based information flow controls, and privacy-preserving data publication. A range of sanitization strategies has been developed to address the wide variety of data content and contexts that arise in practice. It is therefore tempting to separate the complex <b>downgrading</b> <b>operations</b> into untrusted data sanitizers while leaving the verification of security policy to simpler trusted guards that mediate information flow between different sensitivity levels. We argue that this can be a false economy and may result in more restrictive information flow than is necessary. We also observe that the guarantees provided by language-based declassification algorithms do not hold without exacting requirements for the runtime environment, and that the satisfaction of these requirements is the precise goal of MILS architectures, making the two disciplines well-matched complements.

40|$|Classic {{information}} flow systems conservatively define the security label {{associated with a}} derived value {{to be at least}} as restrictive as the security la-bel on any input to that derivation. Because restrictions on {{information flow}} do not necessarily change monotonically over time, this definition requires programmers to invoke <b>downgrading</b> <b>operations.</b> A reactive information flow (RIF) specification for a value v gives (i) allowed uses for v and (ii) the RIF specification for any value that might be directly or indirectly derived from v. RIF specifications thus specify how transforming a value might alter how the result may be used, and that is more expressive than existing approaches for controlling downgrading. We implement a type system for RIF specifications by extending Jif, a dialect of Java that supports a form of classic information flow. By implementing the JRIF language and compiler, we show how a classic information-flow type system can be easily replaced with a more ex-pressive RIF type system. We built example applications with JRIF, and we provide insights into the benefits of RIF-based security labels. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Downgrade</b> <b>operations</b> are not {{specifically}} addressed in the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual procedures for two-lane highways. However, traffic operations on long steep downgrades on two-lane highways are becoming increasingly important due to increasing volumes and the higher percent of slow moving vehicles such as recreational vehicles and heavy trucks in the traffic stream. Compounding the slow moving vehicle platooning problem {{is the fact that}} most downgrades on the primary highway system in Western Canada are long no-passing zones. It is noted that most upgrades on the primary highway system have climbing lanes, and passing lanes are being built on level tangent sections which have extended no-passing zones. This paper presents the findings of a study of traffic flow on long downgrades on the primary highway system in Western Canada. Downgrade data was collected on three long, steep downgrades using a time lapse video camera. The findings indicated that while truck speeds on level terrain are only slightly slower than passenger cars, on downgrades the presence of trucks noticeably affects speed-flow relationships. Both the Hyperlang and Schuhl headway distributions produced excellent fits to the headway data. The data yielded over 6000 platoons. The Geometric, Borel-Tanner, and one parameter Miller distributions provided a good representation of traffic flow on downgrades only under some conditions, however, the two-parameter Miller distribution produced very good fits in all cases of platoon size distributions. ...|$|R

In January 1994 Central was bought in its entirety by Carlton for £750 million The new owners later restructured the company further by combining Central's operations into one and moving its Birmingham studios to a smaller complex elsewhere in the city centre. Network programmes were now classed as Carlton UK Productions and around 140 jobs were lost from the <b>downgraded</b> Birmingham <b>operation.</b>|$|R

40|$|Modern {{applications}} demand {{extremely low}} power budgets in computer architectures for battery-operated devices. In the particular case of implantable devices —the {{main focus of}} this thesis— the system must have a long life span and batteries {{may not be possible}} or easy to recharge. In addition to power, chip area is also of major concern in this specific scenario. Since implantable devices are sometimes placed at locations inside the body where limited space is available, the implant must be as small as possible. The vast amount of volume of an implant is typically occupied by the battery and its electrodes, so the affordable chip area is very limited. Another reason why we want very small processor cores, is because this approach leaves more space for cache memory and it statistically reduces the chance of hardware failures. In this thesis we focus on the arithmetic unit (AU) of such a core, which is typically the adder/subtracter. The goal is to explore existing fault-tolerant and low-power AUs which are suitable for implementation in biomedical implants. A second objective is to study our own idea for a resource-constrained AU, based on graceful degradation: the so-called scalable arithmetic unit (ScAU). When an error occurs, the ScAU is able to proceed with the computational work, but no longer at the normal throughput: instead of single-cycle we <b>downgrade</b> to double-cycle <b>operations.</b> The design of our ScAU as well as several reference designs are all implemented in VHDL, synthesized and analyzed using Synopsys Design Compiler/PrimeTime and ModelSim. A major part of this thesis is dedicated to fault-tolerant design. An extensive study among common and less frequently employed error-detection schemes is performed. Finally, an error-detection scheme is chosen, applied to the ScAU, {{as well as to the}} reference designs for providing fair comparisons. A simple error-correction scheme is implemented as well. The fault-tolerant ScAU proves to have some very interesting advantages over the current state of the art. The fault-tolerant ScAU saves 17 % of area, with a speedup of 12 % for a 7. 3 % increase in power consumption, compared to the conventional technique with the lowest costs. Because of these savings, the power-delay-area product reduces by almost 21 %. Under specific circumstances, our fault-tolerant ScAU is even capable of saving both area and power.
