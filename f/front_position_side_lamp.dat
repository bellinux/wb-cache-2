50|$|Vehicles are {{equipped}} {{with a variety of}} lights and reflectors to mark their presence, position, width, length, and direction of travel as well as to convey the driver's intent and actions to other drivers. These include the vehicle's headlamps, <b>front</b> and rear <b>position</b> <b>lamps,</b> <b>side</b> marker lights and reflectors, turn signals, stop (brake) lamps, and reversing lamps. School buses and Semi-trailer trucks in North America are required to bear retroreflective strips outlining their side and rear perimeters for greater conspicuity at night.|$|R
50|$|LEDs {{were first}} applied to {{automotive}} lighting in centre high mount stop lamps (CHMSL), {{beginning in the}} late 1980s. Adoption of LEDs for other signal functions on passenger cars is gradually increasing with demand for the technology and related styling updates. In North America, the 2000 Cadillac Deville was the first passenger car with LED taillights. The 2002 Kia Opirus/Amanti was an early adopter of LED front turn signals. The 2007 Audi R8 sports car uses two strips of optically focused high-intensity LEDs for its daytime running lamps. Optional on the R8 outside North America was the world's first LED headlamp made by AL-Automotive Lighting. The low and high beams along with the position (parking) lamp and front turn signal are all realised with LEDs. The Lexus LS 600h features LED low beam, <b>position</b> and <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> in North America, and the 2009 Cadillac Escalade Platinum uses LEDs for the low and high beams, {{as well as for the}} <b>position</b> and <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The Mercedes-Benz S-Class (W222) has no non-LED lamps at all, not even in the most basic trim level.|$|R
50|$|A later job of {{the guard}} was the {{provision}} of <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> on brake vans, see picture where all three <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> are visible. The white lamp is the tail lamp, whilst the grey <b>lamps</b> are the <b>side</b> <b>lamps,</b> along with the standard tail lamp (showing red to the rear and sides) required on the rear of every train. The <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> showed a white light towards the front and a red light to the side/rear. The front-facing lamps were an indication to the locomotive crew that the train was still complete, whilst the provision of extra red lights to the rear was an additional safety measure. Due to the very low chance of all three lights being out at once, it was stipulated that a freight train passing without any lamps on the rear had split and that the rear portion was potentially running away. These <b>side</b> <b>lamps</b> were used on passenger trains before the adoption of continuous brakes on such trains.|$|R

5|$|Paul prefers {{playing in}} the half court versus playing up-tempo. He creates scoring {{opportunities}} by constantly changing speeds; upon beating his defender one-on-one or shedding him in the pick-and-roll, he will often slow down and box him out, denying him from regaining <b>front</b> <b>side</b> <b>position</b> and forcing the defense to help at all times. His ability to penetrate deep into the paint leads to easy shots for his teammates, and in 2013 he was second {{in the league in}} assisted three pointers. As a playmaker, he is noted for his consistently high assist-to-turnover ratio, averaging just 2.4 turnovers per game over his career. A deft midrange shooter, he is especially proficient from the right elbow, leading the league in shooting percentage from that area in 2015. On defense, he aggravates opponents with active hands and high effort, and has been ranked {{as one of the best}} perimeter defenders in the NBA.|$|R
40|$|Abstract-The present {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} effect of small amber lamps mounted near {{the front and rear}} on each side of a passenger car-so called side marker lamps-on visual detection and recognition of passenger cars in complex nighttime environments. It was determined whether cars equipped with <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> are detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than cars without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> Subjects were presented with slides of natural nighttime scenes in which a car, either with or without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps,</b> viewed from its side, approaching from a side street, was either present or not. Subjects determined as fast as possible whether a car was present or not. Reaction time measures (speed and accuracy) indicated that both under clear and fog visibility conditions, a car equipped with <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> was detected and recognized earlier and more accurately than a car without <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps.</b> The results indicate that <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> increase both lateral conspicuity and recognizability suggesting that <b>side</b> marker <b>lamps</b> may be effective i...|$|R

Colloquial city light terminology for <b>front</b> <b>position</b> lamps derives from the practice, formerly adhered to in cities like Moscow, London and Paris, of driving at night in built-up areas using these low-intensity lights rather than headlamps.|$|R

50|$|In a {{standard}} 4WD design, the separate four wheels {{are allowed to}} rotate at different speeds {{through the use of}} differentials. This is important for cornering to eliminate binding. In a Mini 4WD, this is not {{a standard}} design and is only achieved through optional one-way wheel sets. Thus, the standard Mini 4WD utilizes a direct drive to all 4 wheels even around corners. Chassis' are designed to hold the motor and batteries in differing arrangements. There are sideways motors positioned in the rear. There are sideways motors <b>positions</b> in the <b>front.</b> There are in-line motors positioned in the middle. Rear and <b>Front</b> <b>position</b> motor designs <b>position</b> batteries <b>side</b> by side in the front or rear of the motor placement. Middle position motor designs position the batteries straddling either side of the motor. Rear and <b>front</b> <b>position</b> motor designs utilize a propeller rod extending from the main motor gear box that drives both the front and rear axles. Middle position motor design powers both the front and back wheels through separate gear boxes eliminating the need for such a propeller rod.|$|R
