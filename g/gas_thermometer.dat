25|$|Many {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for measuring temperature. Most of these rely on measuring some physical property of a working material that varies with temperature. One of the most common devices for measuring temperature is the glass thermometer. This consists of a glass tube filled with mercury or some other liquid, which acts as the working fluid. Temperature increase causes the fluid to expand, so the temperature can be determined by measuring the volume of the fluid. Such thermometers are usually calibrated so that one can read the temperature simply by observing the level of the fluid in the thermometer. Another type of thermometer that is not really used much in practice, but is important from a theoretical standpoint, is the <b>gas</b> <b>thermometer.</b>|$|E
25|$|An ideal {{material}} {{on which a}} temperature scale can be based is the ideal gas. The pressure exerted by a fixed volume and mass of an ideal gas is directly proportional to its temperature. Some natural gases show so nearly ideal properties over suitable temperature ranges {{that they can be}} used for thermometry; this was important during the development of thermodynamics and is still of practical importance today. The ideal <b>gas</b> <b>thermometer</b> is, however, not theoretically perfect for thermodynamics. This is because the entropy of an ideal gas at its absolute zero of temperature is not a positive semi-definite quantity, which puts the gas in violation of the third law of thermodynamics. The physical reason is that the ideal gas law, exactly read, refers to the limit of infinitely high temperature and zero pressure.|$|E

50|$|The ideal <b>gas</b> <b>thermometer</b> can {{be defined}} more {{precisely}} by saying it is a system containing an ideal gas, which is thermally connected to the system it is measuring, while being dynamically and materially insulated from it. It is simultaneously dynamically connected to an external pressure reservoir, from which it is materially and thermally insulated.

30|$|The {{chemistry}} of discharging stream from the wells indicated that about 98 % {{of the total}} gas content is CO 2, while H 2 S, N 2, Ar, H 2 and CH 4 form the remaining steam components (Kosari 2011). The temperature calculated by gas geothermometers, particularly H 2 S geothermometer changes from 269.1 to 277.1  °C (with an average of 274.2  °C), is fairly well correlated with that of Na–K geothermometer (279  °C). However, CO 2 geothermometer estimated temperatures ranging from 287.3 to 308.9  °C (having an average of 301.8  °C) which is higher than those calculated applying all the other <b>gas</b> and solute <b>thermometers</b> (Table  3). The elevated CO 2 concentration in deep liquid {{is the main reason}} for this overestimation (Kosari and Sattari 2015).|$|R
40|$|There is a {{great concern}} about the {{influence}} of the humankind on the cycle of CO 2 {{and its impact on the}} global climate change. This has motivated a worldwide effort to study the budgets of CO 2, which requires field measurements of flux that is dominated by atmospheric turbulence. ^ The study of atmospheric flux requires three-dimensional wind measurements, and one way to do this is by using airborne platforms equipped with sensors like pressure probes, hotwires, etc. Another way is to use a sonic anemometer aboard an inexpensive unmanned aerial vehicle, which is an unexplored technique that has the advantage of gathering data at very low altitudes where manned missions are extremely dangerous. In addition, the application of sonic anemometers has several other advantages, which are robustness, long-term calibration, and lack of moving parts. Together with other sensors like airborne <b>gas</b> analyzers, <b>thermometers</b> etc, it is possible to conduct the atmospheric flux measurement by using unmanned aerial vehicles. ^ A combination of the unmanned aerial vehicle with a sonic anemometer as a technique to measure atmospheric turbulence has been evaluated. To do this, the performance of the sonic anemometer has been analyzed and compared to other existing anemometry techniques, such as hotwires and pressure probes. The unmanned aerial vehicle carrying the sonic anemometer and inertial navigation, global positioning sensors and data acquisition devices has been developed. The entire system has been evaluated by flying at a set altitude same as a nearby ground station. ^ Comparison of the flight test data with the ground station measurements revealed that the airborne system was capable of measuring the mean wind speed. However, the measured vertical turbulence intensity was larger than that measured by the ground station. For this reason, a computational fluid dynamic model of the airplane was developed using a low order panel code. This simulation showed that the aerodynamic disturbances of the aircraft were one of the possible causes of the discrepancy. ^ An error analysis of the complete system has been performed and an overall accuracy of ± 0. 11 m/s has been determined. It has been found that the measurement errors of inertial navigation sensors, compared to the error introduced by the remaining instrumentation, had the largest impact on the accuracy. ...|$|R

Consider a graph of pressure versus temperature made not far from standard conditions (well above absolute zero) for three different samples of any ideal gas (a, b, c). To the extent that the gas is ideal, the pressure depends linearly on temperature, and the extrapolation to zero pressure occurs at absolute zero. Note that data could have been collected with three different amounts of the same gas, which would have rendered this experiment easy to do in the eighteenth century.|$|E
50|$|A {{thermometer}} calibrated to a known {{fixed point}} is accurate (i.e. gives a true reading) at that point.

This may give {{significant differences between}} different types of thermometer at points {{far away from the}} fixed points. For example, the expansion of mercury in a glass thermometer is slightly different from the change in resistance of a platinum resistance thermometer, so these two will disagree slightly at around 50 °C.

The results clarify the role of non-exponential energy distributions as possible generalizations of the Boltzmann distribution for systems where the usual formulation of thermostatistics may not apply. In particular, they show that the power-law distributions derived from Tsallis's nonextensive formalism are irrelevant to the stationary state of the thermometer, thus failing to give a consistent description of the system-thermometer equilibrium. We point out the need of a generalized thermostatistical formulation able to give a unified frame to Levy and Maxwell distributions. Comment: To appear in Phys. Lett. ...|$|E
