5|$|The Senate {{began work}} on its own {{proposals}} while the House was still working. The United States Constitution requires all revenue-related bills to originate in the House. To formally comply with this requirement, the Senate used H.R. 3590, a bill regarding housing tax changes for service members. It had been passed by the House as a revenue-related modification to the Internal Revenue Code. The bill became the Senate's vehicle for its healthcare reform proposal, discarding the bill's original content. The bill ultimately incorporated elements of proposals that were reported favorably by the Senate Health and <b>Finance</b> <b>committees.</b> With the Republican Senate minority vowing to filibuster, 60 votes {{would be necessary to}} pass the Senate. At the start of the 111th Congress, Democrats had only 58 votes; the Senate seat in Minnesota ultimately won by Al Franken was still undergoing a recount, while Arlen Specter was still a Republican (he became a Democrat in April, 2009).|$|E

In 2010, however, Schumer suggested that a hedge-fund tax would be acceptable and not hurt the industry.|$|E

2500|$|Entering {{politics}} as a Democrat and supporter of Martin Van Buren, Boutwell was appointed head of the Groton post office by his business partner, who had been appointed postmaster. [...] Boutwell's first entry into elective politics was a successful run for the Groton School Committee as a Temperance Party candidate; he would sit on that committee for many years. [...] The success prompted him {{to run for the}} state legislature on the same party's ticket; because the party was a small third party, he lost badly. [...] In 1840, he won the Democratic Party nomination, despite temperance opinions that were [...] "offensive to many", but lost in a Whig landslide. [...] He finally won on the third try, defeating incumbent John Boynton in 1841. [...] He won reelection twice before being defeated in 1844. [...] Although he also lost in 1845, he was returned to the state legislature in the 1846 election, serving from 1847 to 1850. [...] His elective successes, sometimes in the face of major Whig victories statewide, highlighted Boutwell's potential, and brought him into the Democratic Party's leadership circles. [...] He sat on the judiciary and <b>finance</b> <b>committees,</b> where he gained a reputation for thorough research into legislation, and advocated positions favoring free trade, restraint of the money supply, and increased taxes for spending on education and other reforms.

2500|$|In December 2010 Alaskan {{state senator}} Scott Kawasaki {{proposed}} legislation creating the state's first law and medical schools, {{with the law}} school in Anchorage. Kawasaki cited high legal costs, his desire {{for the state to}} be a model for tribal and environmental law and not losing Alaskan law talent to the lower 48 states as reasons for the legislation. In reply, the University of Alaska System noted that [...] "adding graduate programs would require an analysis of student demand and the work force needed to staff" [...] a law school. On January 7, 2011 Kawasaki introduced Alaska House Bill (HB) 38, [...] "University Institutes Of Law And Medicine" [...] at the University of Alaska, to the 2011 legislative session. A day after the bill was introduced, it was opposed by legislators [...] "who question the cost and the need for Alaska to have the schools." [...] A commentator replied that due to the absence of an Alaskan law school, the Alaska Law Review had been published by the UCLA and Duke University Schools of Law. The Juneau Empire opposed an Alaska law school in a January 16 editorial, saying that [...] "the idea of creating Alaska's own JD factory should be quickly dismissed." [...] Asserting that Alaska has had little trouble attracting lawyers and the U.S. has too many attorneys (rather than Alaska having too few), the newspaper proposed: [...] "The seed money required to launch a law school could go to better use to endow scholarships for bright Alaskans to go outside for a fully funded legal education, in the same vein as the WWAMI program for Alaska's medical students. It could also be used to better fund district attorney's offices, Legal Aid, victims' compensation and public defenders programs." [...] The House referred the bill to the Education and <b>Finance</b> <b>Committees</b> on January 18, 2011.|$|E
