5|$|Meanwhile, Tony follows Chastity into a cave in {{the woods}} and stumbles upon a bizarre shaft of light. Once Tony steps into the light, he is possessed with the same {{abilities}} that Max and Chastity have, the ability to vibrate at high frequencies, allowing Tony to move faster than normal vision can detect. At the same time, however, Max collapses and is sent to the hospital where it is found he is suffering from exhaustion, withdrawal, a concussion, muscular tears and skeletal fractures - basically, his abilities are killing him. Mulder eventually deduces that he possesses superhuman speed. Chastity sneaks Max out of the hospital where he returns to the cave (even though she suggested they go somewhere else for help but Max refused). Later, the sheriff finds the <b>flashlight</b> <b>in</b> Max's room and confronts his son about the murders. Max confesses and then attempts to kill his father, but Tony intervenes, taking the sheriff's gun; the sheriff is promptly taken to the hospital. That night, Tony and Chastity head to the cave so that Max won't use up any more of the remaining power. Once there, Chastity has been knocked unconscious by Max, who then confronts Tony, using his abilities to take back the gun before throwing it away. However, Chastity (having come to and using her abilities) takes the gun and shoots Max from behind, then allows herself to be shot by the same bullet; she tells Tony that she can't go back to the way things were before. Afterwards, Tony is seen in the hospital recuperating while numerous geological experts examined the cave, but were unable to identify anything unusual. The city then fills the cave with concrete, sealing it forever, leaving the question as to what caused the teenager-related ability a mystery.|$|E

500|$|The lights, and, by extension, the {{flashlight}} and flash beacon, {{are found in}} all main games, excluding the third. While use varies per game, lights are generally used to ward off animatronics, or warn the player of their presence. Lights {{in the first game}} and second games are activated via buttons mounted into the walls, and light up the player's 'blind spot', being the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The fifth game has the lights work similarly, however, they are now mounted onto a control pad, and serve no purpose other than the ability to see the animatronics, due to the different gameplay style. [...] The <b>flashlight</b> <b>in</b> the second and fourth game works in the same fashion as its real life counterpart, {{in the sense that it}} has a limited battery life, albeit only in the second game, and must be toggled on and off. The flash beacon was introduced in Sister Location, and is used to quickly gather bearings in the pitch black room seen on the third and fifth nights.|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{arrived at}} the scene around 11:45p.m. After about ten minutes, a man walked up to Hollis' driver-side door and flashed a <b>flashlight</b> <b>in</b> his face, {{blinding}} him. Hollis, {{not sure if it}} was a prank or if he had been mistaken for someone else, told the man, [...] "Fellow, you've got me mixed up with someone else. You've got the wrong man." [...] The man had a pistol and told him something like, [...] "I don't want to kill you fellow, so do what I say", and ordered them {{to get out of the}} car. They both got out through the driver-side door. The man told Hollis to [...] "take off your [...] britches." [...] Larey pleaded with Hollis to please take them off, believing that if he did they would not be hurt, but, after Hollis removed his trousers, he was struck twice in the head with a heavy, blunt object. Larey explained in an interview three months later with Texarkana Gazette reporter Lucille Holland that the noise was so loud she thought he had been shot, but she learned later it was the sound of his skull cracking.|$|E

The dissolve detection is based on the skipping image difference and linearity error in a sequential image buffer. We also eliminated the effect of <b>flashlights</b> <b>in</b> our algorithms. We submitted 5 runs to TRECVID 2004. Their run-ids are “D 0, D 1, …, D 4 ”. They use the same algorithms with different parameter settings.

40|$|Aim: This study aims {{to assess}} the {{infection}} risks of <b>flashlight</b> contamination <b>in</b> a stomatology hospital and compare the disinfection effectiveness of alcohol (75 %) and disinfecting wipes. Background: The flashlight is a basic non-critical medical device in oral and maxillofacial surgery wards. Wounds are mostly found in oral cavities; therefore, reusable flashlights may be a potential source of nosocomial infections (NIs). However, the microbial flora present <b>in</b> <b>flashlights</b> used <b>in</b> hospitals {{has not yet been}} explored. Methods: This study investigated the microbial contamination of 41 <b>flashlights</b> used <b>in</b> a stomatology hospital in Guangzhou in March 2016. Results: Results indicated that 75. 6 %(31 / 41) of the flashlights had microbial contamination. Gram-positive bacteria accounted for 72. 7 %(24 / 33) of the microbial groups contaminating the flashlights, and Gram-negative bacteria (21. 2 %, 7 / 33), and fungi (6. 1 %, 2 / 33) constituted the remaining contaminants. The predominantly isolated species was Staphyloccus (66. 7 %, 22 / 33), especially Staphylococcus aureus (24. 2 %, 8 / 33). Approximately 77. 3 % (17 / 22) of the types of bacteria detected in the hands were same as those <b>in</b> the corresponding <b>flashlights.</b> Both the bacterial overstandard and S.  aureus detection rates of doctors' flashlights were higher than those of nurses' flashlights (16 / 17 vs. 14 / 23, 7 / 17 vs. 1 / 23, respectively) (P    0. 05). Conclusion: Flashlights are potential causes of NIs. Disinfecting flashlights could be an effective and practical infection control method...|$|R

2500|$|... 467 performers, each {{wearing one}} of the 5 Olympic colours, created a 20 meter tall ski jumper formation, after the playing of the Italian {{national}} anthem.

Puffs of air {{could be seen as}} the jumper prepared his jump. Performers carrying a blue banner then entered to show the skier gliding down the slope. In flight the figure was lit up by headlamp <b>flashlights</b> <b>in</b> a formation of a ski jumper in peak flight. The ski jumper eventually made a graceful landing on the ground as performers released confetti (to represent a snowplow stop) and cheered as the segment came to a close.|$|R

50|$|Most Surefire {{flashlight}} {{models are}} made of anodized aluminum alloy in various colors, while a few models {{are made of}} Nitrolon, a proprietary glass-filled polyamide nylon plastic.
