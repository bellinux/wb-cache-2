500|$|In an {{interview}} after the episode aired, Sapochnik detailed {{the process of}} filming the battle and called Akira Kurosawa's Ran an inspiration in shooting the scenes: [...] "I watched every pitch field battle I could find (footage of real ones too), looking for patterns — for what works, what doesn't, what takes {{you out of the}} moment, what keeps you locked in. Interestingly one of the things I noticed is that staging of these battles through the years has changed dramatically. Back in the day you'd see these huge aerial shots of horse charges and there were two big differences. First, it was all real — no CGI or digital replication. And second, often when the horses would go down, you can kind of tell they got really hurt. Nowadays you'd never <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> and nor would you want to." ...|$|E
2500|$|Singer {{stated that}} he had to tone down the special effects to keep the film age-appropriate for children. He said, [...] "This movie {{probably}} has a bigger on-screen body count than any movie I've done before. It's done in a way that's fun, but it was a challenge to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> without it becoming upsetting to people... It was about creating a tone like Raiders of the Lost Ark or Star Wars that allows you to get away with a lot of stuff because it feels like a movie." ...|$|E
6000|$|Frankness was an {{essential}} quality of Heavy Tree Hill. [...] "We were just saying, Jack," [...] said an old locator, [...] "that, {{giving you a}} fair show and your own game, you could manage to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> pile before daybreak." ...|$|E
2500|$|The fictional detective {{inspector}} William E. [...] "Jack" [...] Frost in {{the novels}} of R. D. Wingfield is a recipient of the George Cross, which sometimes serves as a plot element in allowing him to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> actions <b>that</b> would otherwise have landed him in trouble.|$|R
5000|$|... "He {{knows what}} it is. I {{told him to get}} into the cage with me. Five rounds, homie, fight me! He wouldn't do it. I am asking Keith Murray to do the same. I’ll break his ass down in two. He’s a five dollar dude. Sign the papers, we’ll set it up, and can handle it. That goes for any ma’fucka who has {{problems}} with me. We’ll get in the cage. If you can beat me, you get the money and I’ll get my ass beat. Let people do what they got to do. I’m in war mode. I’m more ready now than I've ever been. People aren't <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> dumb shit. DMX can’t fight." ...|$|R
5000|$|What made it worse, {{was that}} the Hill vs. Mill {{conflict}} also entered {{into some of the}} adults lives and judgments. Some of the teachers and administrators blatantly gave the Hill kids preferential treatment, whilst the Mill kids got punished more harshly, and also on the flip side, people would gossip more harshly about the Hill people when they <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> something <b>that</b> the Mill people couldn't <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{wish to be}} {{too hard}} on these two men, but I think they're frauds, {{and they may have}} complices that we don't know nothing about. If they have, won't the complices <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> bag of gold Peter Wilks left? It ain't unlikely. If these men ain't frauds, they won't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they're all right--ain't that so?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is it KETCHING? Why, how you talk. Is a HARROW catching--in the dark? If {{you don't}} hitch on to one tooth, you're bound to on another, ain't you? And you can't <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> tooth without {{fetching}} the whole harrow along, can you? Well, {{these kind of}} mumps {{is a kind of}} a harrow, as you may say--and it ain't no slouch of a harrow, nuther, you come to get it hitched on good." ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{reckless}} antipathy of {{the domestic}} fowls to this inoffensive lady remains to be explained. Having rejected her theory, I am bound in honour to set up one of my own. Happily an inventory of her effects, now before me, furnishes a tolerably safe basis. Amongst the articles of personal property I note [...] "One long, thin, silken fishing line, and hook." [...] Now if I were a barn-yard fowl--say a goose--and a lady not {{a friend of mine}} were to pass me, munching sweetmeats, and were to drop a nice fat worm, passing on apparently unconscious of her loss, I think I should try to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> worm. And if after swallowing it I felt drawn towards that lady by a strong personal attachment, I suppose that I should yield if I could not help it. And then if the lady chose to run and I chose to follow, making a good deal of noise, I suppose it would look as if I were engaged in a very reprehensible pursuit, would it not? With the light I have, that {{is the way in which}} the case presents itself to my intelligence; though, of course, I may be wrong.|$|E
5000|$|In December 2015 Jones {{made public}} his strong {{criticism}} of the new Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, in particular after Corbyn opposed military intervention in the Syrian Civil War. Jones stated [...] "because of Corbyn's incompetence, the Tories are <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> things <b>that</b> are not being properly scrutinised {{and the people who}} are suffering are the ones that we represent." ...|$|R
5000|$|Publishers Weekly {{described}} the novella as a [...] "blend of 1900s H. G. Wells and 1970s propaganda, updated for the 21st {{century in the}} clear, chilly and fashionably cynical style <b>that</b> lets Stross <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> premises <b>that</b> would be absurdly cheesy in anyone else's hands." [...] Carl Hays in his review for Booklist called the novel a [...] "bizarre, nevertheless brilliant alternate-history novella featuring a protracted U.S.-Soviet cold war." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "If it {{were only}} for a fixed time, a month or three months, or even six months," [...] the poor lady said to herself, [...] "I might stand it. It {{would be hard to}} do without all the things I want, and be afraid even to pay the money I {{borrowed}} to go to South America, but if I knew when the day was certainly coming when I could hold up my head and let everybody know just what I am, and take my proper place in the community, then I might wait. But nobody knows {{how long it will take}} the captain to <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> gold. He may have to make ever so many voyages. He may meet with wrecks, and dear knows what. It may be years before they are ready to tell me I am a free woman, and may do what I please with my own. I may die in poverty, and leave Mr. Cliff's nephews to get all the good of the draft and the money in my trunk up-stairs. I suppose they would think it came from Valparaiso, and that I had been hoarding it. It's all very well for Edna. She is going to Europe, where Ralph will be educated, I suppose, and where she can live as she pleases, and nobody will ask her any questions, and she need not answer them, if they should. But I must stay here, in debt, and in actual want of the comforts of life, making believe to pinch and to save, until a sea-captain thousands and thousands of miles away shall feel that he is ready to let me put my hand in my pocket and spend my riches." ...|$|E
6000|$|He traversed the shrubbery, glanced {{into the}} walled garden--no Jon! Nor where the peaches and the {{apricots}} {{were beginning to}} swell and colour. He passed the Cupressus trees, dark and spiral, into the meadow. Where had the boy got to? Had he rushed down to the coppice--his old hunting-ground? Jolyon crossed the rows of hay. They would cock it on Monday and be carrying the day after, if rain held off. Often they had crossed this field together--hand in hand, when Jon was a little chap. Dash it! The golden age was over by the time one was ten! He came to the pond, where flies and gnats were dancing over a bright reedy surface; and on into the coppice. It was cool there, fragrant of larches. Still no Jon! He called. No answer! On the log seat he sat down, nervous, anxious, forgetting his own physical sensations. He had been wrong to let the boy <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> letter; {{he ought to have}} kept him under his eye from the start! Greatly troubled, he got up to retrace his steps. At the farm-buildings he called again, and looked into the dark cow-house. There in the cool, and the scent of vanilla and ammonia, away from flies, the three Alderneys were chewing the quiet cud; just milked, waiting for evening, to be turned out again into the lower field. One turned a lazy head, a lustrous eye; Jolyon could see the slobber on its grey lower lip. He saw everything with passionate clearness, in the agitation of his nerves--all that in his time he had adored and tried to paint--wonder of light and shade and colour. No wonder the legend put Christ into a manger--what more devotional than the eyes and moon-white horns of a chewing cow in the warm dusk! He called again. No answer! And he hurried away out of the coppice, past the pond, up the hill. Oddly ironical--now he came to think of it--if Jon had taken the gruel of his discovery down in the coppice where his mother and Bosinney in those old days had made the plunge of acknowledging their love. Where he himself, on the log seat the Sunday morning he came back from Paris, had realised to the full that Irene had become the world to him. That would have been the place for Irony to tear the veil from before the eyes of Irene's boy! But he was not here! Where had he got to? One must find the poor chap! ...|$|E

5000|$|At the 2013 PaleyFest, Falchuk {{compared}} the series to horror films: [...] "It does demand {{a little bit}} of compassion at the end because {{you fall in love with}} these characters in a different way than you would in a movie," [...] he said. [...] "If you want to kill everybody in a movie except one person, you can kind of <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> but if you're looking to do a horror TV show, you have a different responsibility to the characters because the audience has a different affection for them." ...|$|E

[...] Two more Representatives, Jon Porter (R-NV) and Kay Granger (R-TX) also supported LaHood's recommendation to suspend the page program until an outside team could evaluate its security protocol.

He told Musician magazine in 1989: [...] When we started, and were playing in pubs, I wasn't the singer ... I was the drunk rhythm guitarist who wrote all these weird songs. We went through about five different singers - they were fucking useless, basically. I always ended up thinking, 'I could do better than this.' ... I mean, I hated my voice, but I didn't hate it more than I hated everyone else's voice ... So I thought, 'If I can <b>get</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> <b>that,</b> I can be the singer.'

5000|$|Confronted with {{unhealthy}} criticism or unhealthy {{responses to}} criticism, {{it may be}} unwise to get scared, {{and it may be}} unnecessary to run to the doctor straightaway.
