50|$|In colonial times, it was {{difficult}} to hide a pre-marital pregnancy. Even during cases of <b>disputed</b> <b>paternity,</b> one irrefutable fact was that a baby had been born and legally had no father. Men could avoid the label of “father” if the pregnant woman chose to hide or conceal the truth from her midwife or the courts. Trying to avoid the bastardy or fornication laws seemed the easiest thing {{to do in order to}} avoid the stigmas attached to being guilty of fornication and bastardy. Both parents or each parent individually could flee the region. The reputed father had the option of arranging a private settlement with the mother to avoid publicly being a bastard's father. Abortions, concealing births, tricked marriages, and bribery were used to help conceal crimes of bastardy. Other methods of preventing bastardy existed, but not widely used. Birth control existed within colonial America, but due to a lack of understanding of human anatomy, attempts at preventing pregnancy during this time often failed. Coitus interruptus, which meant that the male withdrew before ejaculating, was not a useful method of birth control. Nor were barrier methods of contraception. Condoms existed, but males used them to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases. People during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries did not understand that condoms had other uses, such as a method to prevent pregnancy. Males and females also made promises of abstinence, but that also did not always work as it should. To avoid bastardy, the couple had the option of engaging in infanticide, the purposeful murder of a baby. Typically, parents who engaged in infanticide used it as an absolute last resort to cover up a pre-marital pregnancy. In Pennsylvania, infanticide, defined legally, was concealing the death of a bastard child. There were laws in place against infanticide in each colony. However, establishing that infanticide took place proved difficult. Instances such as a child being born stillborn or the jury of a court understanding a single mothers plight made cases of infanticide tough to prosecute. Options did exist for colonists to attempt to escape from bastardy and fornication charges, although many of those choices lead to less than desirable outcomes.|$|E

50|$|Men {{and women}} had equal roles in {{creating}} a situation where bastardy laws had to be enforced. All cases of bastardy heard before colonial courts were {{the direct result of}} an act of adultery or fornication. Early in colonial history, men took more of the responsibility for an act of fornication or a bastardy charge. Women before the courts claimed that they engaged in sexual activity with men and explained to the courtroom that if somehow they ended up pregnant as a result that the man would marry them, thus preventing the birth of a bastard child. A child being born out of wedlock automatically resulted in a trial to determine who the father was and who and how the bastard would be cared for. To catch fornicators, one had to either find the couple committing the act, or the couple had to immediately confess their sin. Someone finding a pair engaged in fornication was rare. Thus, many times court cases relied on confessions to bring about charges in a case of bastardy. By 1668 in the Massachusetts colony, women had begun to name the fathers of their bastard children during childbirth. This act earned legal recognition by the Puritan courts, as it was believed that women endured so much anguish during childbirth that they would not lie and truthfully confess to their sin of fornication and reveal who the baby’s father was. Either the pregnant women would willingly tell someone that she had a bastard son, and then she would name the father or a midwife would ask the mother to tell whether or not her child was legitimate. If the midwife discovered that the baby was a bastard, then the courts expected that the midwife get the mother to disclose who the father was. Bastardy cases in the colonies involved women of high, low, and middle standing, similarly to England. Once a bastard child was born, women could not deny a charge of adultery, or more common a charge of fornication. The baby was undeniable proof that an illicit sexual act took place. Where the courts did have trouble was in determining who the father of the bastard was. While the courts believed women to be truthful during their childbirth confession, they were not always entirely. For whatever reason, a woman could name a man who was later revealed to not be the baby’s father. Such situations resulted in <b>disputed</b> <b>paternity</b> suits. While the courts initially relied on confessions to make judgments in bastardy cases, as it became apparent that the confessions could be lies, the courts gradually came to trust evidence-based claims more so than testimony-based claims. In {{the latter half of the}} eighteenth century, this trend reflected a growing shift in colonial courts as a movement away from more faith-based rules and towards law grounded more in English common law. In the 1650s, when the colonial courts reached a verdict in cases of adultery or fornication, the guilty parties had to pay fines ranging from forty shillings to ten pounds and were publicly struck with a whip six to fifteen times. By the 1680s, the fine usually amounted to forty shillings or ten blows of the whip. These punishments became standard procedure by 1692. From 1639-1666, in Connecticut, if a father did not willingly come forward to acknowledge his illegitimate child, the mother of the bastard received a public whipping. The thought was that the male would not stand idly by and watch the mother of his child receive such a harsh punishment and public humiliation. Not all individuals who committed acts of fornication and bastardy ended up in front of a court. To avoid the penalties and shame of having a bastard child, men and women took different steps to avoid pregnancy while engaging in sexual behavior.|$|E
