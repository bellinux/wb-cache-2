60|$|But May Maylands did not stick {{her feet}} in hot water; neither <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to bed, or take any physic. Indeed there was no {{occasion}} to do so, for a clear complexion and pink cheeks told of robust health.|$|E
60|$|But in {{the shadow}} of the narrow alley between the two houses she stood still and pleasured in the ring of his foot falls down the cement sidewalk. Not until they had quite died away <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> on. She crept up the back stairs and across the kitchen to her room, {{registering}} her thanksgiving that Sarah was asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "So it be. Sister, indeed! Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> and make--. I won't {{say what}} she's made of herself. Ain't she brought trouble and sorrow enough upon us? Have her here! Why, I'm that angry with her, I shouldn't be keeping my hands off her. Why didn't she keep herself to herself, and not disgrace the whole family?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His was not {{a nature}} to rest inactive. He poured out a hundred {{questions}} to Jack who could not answer {{half a dozen of}} them. [...] "Who is <b>she?</b> Where <b>does</b> <b>she</b> live? <b>Do</b> you know her? Is she a good scholar? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to church? I hope she don't talk religion. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to parties? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> dance?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Fulkerson!" [...] Dryfoos snorted. [...] "Where's Mrs. Mandel, I {{should like}} to know? He brought her, too. <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> traipsin' off this way every evening?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She's {{a regular}} play actor. I don't like made-up people. Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> {{around with her}} sleeves rolled up that way, and--and her dress open at the throat?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Aunt Ursel! Oh, Nuttie, Nuttie, I {{had almost}} forgotten! How could I?' {{and there was}} a shower of tears of compunction. 'But he said he owed {{everything}} to her! She will come with us! Or if she doesn't live with us, we will make her live close by in a dear little cottage. Where is she? When <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go?</b> I never saw her go.' ...|$|E
60|$|Jarman, {{warming to}} his work, then {{proposed}} {{the health of}} Mrs. Peedles, as true-hearted and hard-breathing a lady as ever it had been his privilege to know. Her talent for cheery conversation was familiar to us all, upon it he need not enlarge; all he would say was that personally never <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> {{out of his room}} without leaving him more cheerful than when she entered it.|$|E
6000|$|Therefore they watch'd a {{time when}} they might sift [...] This hidden whim; and long they watch'd in vain; [...] For seldom <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to chapel-shrift, [...] And seldom felt she any hunger-pain; [...] And when she left, she hurried back, as swift [...] As bird on wing to breast its eggs again; [...] 470 [...] And, patient, as a hen-bird, sat her there [...] Beside her Basil, weeping through her hair.|$|E
6000|$|... "The prettiest women's name going; there's no {{name like}} it," [...] said the contractor, {{with an unusual}} {{tenderness}} in his voice. [...] "Mary--yes; but Mary what? What other name <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> by?" ...|$|R
50|$|After the February Revolution <b>she</b> <b>did</b> not {{flee the}} Tsarskoye Selo {{as many of}} her {{relatives}} <b>did.</b> <b>She</b> <b>went</b> {{to work on the}} World War I front, but settled in Kiev with her lover, Countess Maria Nierodt.|$|R
5000|$|Chris Jones of BBC Music called Trailer Park [...] "a very English record" [...] {{and wrote}} that [...] "only on the poppier 'Don't Need a Reason' or 'Someone's Daughter' <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> badly wrong." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yesterday--to Fleurieres? Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to Fleurieres? What day is this? What day was yesterday? Ah, then I shan't see her," [...] said Valentin, sadly. [...] "Fleurieres is too far!" [...] And then {{he closed}} his eyes again. Newman sat silent, {{summoning}} pious invention to his aid, but he was relieved at finding that Valentin was apparently too weak to reason or to be curious. Bellegarde, however, presently went on. [...] "And my mother--and my brother--will they come? Are they at Fleurieres?" ...|$|E
6000|$|How {{did she do}} it? In {{the word}} [...] "missing" [...] there is a horrible depth of doubt and speculation. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> quickly from under the men's feet, or did she resist to the end, letting the sea batter her to pieces, start her butts, wrench her frame, load her with an {{increasing}} weight of salt water, and, dismasted, unmanageable, rolling heavily, her boats gone, her decks swept, had she wearied her men half to death with the unceasing labour at the pumps before she sank with them like a stone? ...|$|E
6000|$|She did {{not come}} into sight. Apparently she had not gone round by the post office after all. It made one wonder where she had gone. <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> up through the town to the avenue on these occasions?... Then {{abruptly}} a cloud drove across the sunlight, the glowing street went cold and Mr. Lewisham's imagination submitted to control. So [...] "Mater saeva cupidinum," [...] "The untamable mother of desires,"--Horace (Book II. of the Odes) was the author appointed by the university for Mr. Lewisham's matriculation--was, after all, translated to its prophetic end.|$|E
6000|$|His brother {{answered}} the question. He looked backward and forward suspiciously between Julius and Anne. [...] "What <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> out for at his time?" [...] he said. [...] "Has {{she left the}} house to avoid Me?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Bernard {{gave her}} a {{grateful}} smile, but while he smiled, he asked himself a serious question. [...] "Why the deuce <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> on flattering me?--You have always been very kind to me," [...] he said aloud.|$|R
50|$|What {{happens when}} Radha learns {{about the fact}} later? Will she {{continue}} her married life with Ramudu or <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>goes</b> to Raghu or anything strange happens... The remaining part of the movie is based on these circumstances.|$|R
60|$|But yet {{she waited}} for him to come again. Not once during the next ten days, {{excepting}} on the Sunday, <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> out of the house during the hours that her cousin would be in London. Very sad and monotonous was her life, passed alone in her own bedroom. And it was the more sad, because Mrs Buggins somewhat resented the manner in which her husband was treated. Mrs Buggins was still attentive, but she made little speeches about Buggins' respectability, and Margaret felt that her presence in the house was an annoyance.|$|E
6000|$|The self-justifying tone rather puzzled Miss King. She noted {{likewise}} that Isabel was {{backward in}} entering into {{details of her}} home life, and that she {{never said a word}} to encourage her sister's wishes to visit her at Northwold. Knowing Isabel as the governess did, she was sure that she would not merely talk of things on the surface, if her spirit were fully content. Only once <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> any deeper, and that was as she took up a little book of religious poetry of which she had been very fond. 'Ah!' she said, 'I don't feel these things as I used. I think practical life dulls one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do immensely! If Isabel's unhappy I'm {{very sorry}} for her, but I can't help it. I might tell her {{something}} {{that would make her}} worse, but I can't tell her anything that would console her. What <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> and marry him for? If she had listened to me she'd have got rid of him. I'll forgive her, however, if I find she has made things hot for him! If she has simply allowed him to trample upon her I don't know that I shall even pity her. But I don't think that's very likely. I count upon finding that if she's miserable she has at least made HIM so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I was her father! I was her father!’ {{cried the}} old man, {{stretching}} {{out his hands}} to the dark shadows flying on above. ‘Have mercy on her, and on me! Where <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go?</b> Turn her back! I was her father!’ ...|$|R
60|$|This <b>done,</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> up {{to visit}} Margaret, {{to tell her}} the story, and consult her. But this was not so easy. She found Margaret with little Daisy lying by her, and Tom sitting by the fire over his Latin.|$|R
6000|$|... 'SHE warn't, sir,' said Sloppy, {{taking this}} ghostly counsel rather ill, {{in behalf of}} his late benefactress. 'Let us speak for ourselves, sir. <b>She</b> <b>went</b> through with {{whatever}} duty <b>she</b> had to <b>do.</b> <b>She</b> <b>went</b> through with me, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> through with the Minders, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> through with herself, <b>she</b> <b>went</b> through with everythink. O Mrs Higden, Mrs Higden, you was {{a woman and a}} mother and a mangler in a million million!' ...|$|R
6000|$|Her {{situation}} was altogether {{the subject of}} hours of gratitude to Mrs. Weston, and of moments only of regret; and her satisfaction--her more than satisfaction--her cheerful enjoyment, was so just and so apparent, that Emma, well as she knew her father, was sometimes taken by surprize at his being still able to pity 'poor Miss Taylor,' when they left her at Randalls in the centre of every domestic comfort, or saw her go away in the evening attended by her pleasant husband to a carriage of her own. But never <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> without Mr. Woodhouse's giving a gentle sigh, and saying, [...] "Ah, poor Miss Taylor! She would be very glad to stay." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then, again: Had she a {{carriage}} of her own? What ladies {{took care of}} her when she went out? Did she like dancing? What were the fashionable dances at noblemen's houses? Did young ladies in the great world practise the pianoforte much? How many offers had my sister had? <b>Did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to Court, as well as my father? What did she talk about to gentlemen, and what did gentlemen talk about to her? If she were speaking to a duke, how often would she say [...] "your Grace" [...] to him? and would a duke get her a chair, or an ice, and wait on her just as gentlemen without titles waited on ladies, when they met them in society? ...|$|E
60|$|But {{there was}} one honest loyal little heart that carried back--three {{thousand}} miles--to England the man as it had known and loved him. Lady Elfrida Runnybroke never married; neither <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> into retirement, but lived her life and fulfilled her duties in her usual clear-eyed fashion. She was particularly kind to all Americans,--barring, I fear, a few pretty-faced, finely-frocked title-hunters,--told stories of the Far West, and had theories of a people of which they knew little, cared less, and believed to be vulgar. But I think she found a new pleasure in the old church at Ashley Grange, and loved to linger over the effigy of the old Crusader,--her kinsman, the swashbuckler De Bracy,--with a vague but pretty belief that devotion and love do not die with brave men, but live and flourish even in lands beyond the seas.|$|E
60|$|Daylight {{waited to}} see if <b>she</b> were quite <b>done,</b> and <b>she</b> <b>went</b> on again.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{that gives}} us a limit. Our lady enters this room, and what <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>do?</b> <b>She</b> <b>goes</b> over to the writing-table. What for? Not for {{anything}} in the drawers. If there had been anything worth her taking, it would surely have been locked up. No, it was for something in that wooden bureau. Halloa! what is that scratch upon the face of it? Just hold a match, Watson. Why did you not tell me of this, Hopkins?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{following}} day in town after {{going to the}} police, Helen sees what she thinks is her dead Husband James. Only after speaking {{to him for a}} moment <b>does</b> <b>she</b> realize it is Will. He asks her to leave with him. The film ends with Helen contemplating a return Toronto and to her normal life... Or <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> with Will? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My brethren of Paradise"; {{who could}} she be that rode so late in company of armed men, and yet spoke of such great kinsfolk? That {{it might be the}} holy Colette, then, as now, so famous in France for her miracles, and good deeds, and her austerities, was a thought that arose in me. But the holy Sister, as I had heard, never mounted a horse in her many wanderings, she being a villein's daughter, but was carried in a litter, or fared in a chariot; nor <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> in company with armed men, for who would dare to lay hands on her? Moreover, the voice that I had heard was that of a very young girl, and the holy Sister Colette was now entered into the vale of years. So my {{questioning}} found no answer.|$|E
6000|$|... "They won't thank me--they won't thank me," [...] Valentin murmured. [...] "They {{will pass}} an atrocious night, and Urbain doesn't like {{the early morning}} air. I don't {{remember}} ever {{in my life to}} have seen him before noon--before breakfast. No one ever saw him. We don't know how he is then. Perhaps he's different. Who knows? Posterity, perhaps, will know. That's the time he works, in his cabinet, at the history of the Princesses. But I had to send for them--hadn't I? And then I want to see my mother sit there where you sit, and say good-by to her. Perhaps, after all, I don't know her, and she will have some surprise for me. Don't think you know her yet, yourself; perhaps she may surprise YOU. But if I can't see Claire, I don't care for anything. I have been thinking of it--and in my dreams, too. Why <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to Fleurieres to-day? She never told me. What has happened? Ah, she ought to have guessed I was here--this way. It {{is the first time in}} her life she ever disappointed me. Poor Claire!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Wos Jenny {{here when}} the lady come? Yes, she wos here when the lady come. Wot did the lady say to her? Well, I'll tell you wot the lady said to her. She said, 'You {{remember}} me as come one {{time to talk}} to you about the young lady as had been a-wisiting of you? You remember me as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she had left?' Ah, she remembered. So we all did. Well, then, wos that young lady up at the house now? No, she warn't up at the house now. Well, then, lookee here. The lady was upon a journey all alone, strange as we might think it, and could she rest herself where you're a setten for a hour or so. Yes she could, and so she did. Then she went--it might be at twenty minutes past eleven, and it might be at twenty minutes past twelve; we ain't got no watches here to know the time by, nor yet clocks. Where <b>did</b> <b>she</b> <b>go?</b> I don't know where she go'd. She went one way, and Jenny went another; one went right to Lunnun, and t'other went right from it. That's all about it. Ask this man. He heerd it all, and see it all. He knows." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course she}} has got friends, if she'll only take {{up with them}} as <b>she</b> ought to <b>do.</b> Why <b>does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> on shilly-shallying with that young man, instead of closing upon it at once? If <b>she</b> <b>did</b> that <b>she</b> wouldn't want such friends as Lady Ushant. Why did the girl come to you with all this instead of asking me?" ...|$|R
60|$|And {{it seemed}} that, after all, Stephen {{had not yet}} made his desired {{communication}} to her father. Again <b>she</b> <b>went</b> indoors, wondering where Stephen could be. For want of something better to <b>do,</b> <b>she</b> <b>went</b> upstairs to her own little room. Here she {{sat down at the}} open window, and, leaning with her elbow on the table and her cheek upon her hand, she fell into meditation.|$|R
5000|$|... "How'd she {{happen to}} mention me? <b>Does</b> <b>she</b> <b>go</b> to B.M. now? She said <b>she</b> might <b>go</b> there. <b>She</b> said might <b>go</b> to Shipley, too. I thought <b>she</b> <b>went</b> to Shipley. How'd she happen to mention me?" [...] I was pretty excited. I really was.I don't know, for Chrissake. Lift up, willya? You're on my towel," [...] Stradlater said. I {{was sitting on}} his stupid towel."Jane Gallagher," [...] I said. I couldn't get over it. [...] "Jesus H. Christ." ...|$|R
