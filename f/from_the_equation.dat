Ken reverses his ultimatum after a conversation with a dismayed Finn and cancels the extra practice, allowing the football players to again do both activities. Meanwhile, Will and Emma spend more time together while Will prepares the mash-up, and soon realize they have strong feelings for one another. Will decides to remove himself <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> and later tells Emma and Ken that he {{will not be able to}} create their mash-up.|$|E
5|$|But, after {{assessing}} {{the situation in}} Alsace, Julian evidently decided that his force was insufficient to prevail over the Alamanni alone. Instead, {{he set out to}} recover Cologne. From Metz, he led his army via Treviri (Trier) to Roman-held Koblenz and thence along the Rhine to Cologne. Entering the ruined city unopposed, Julian's men were set to work to rebuild the city walls. Julian then concluded a peace treaty with the Franks. This had the important result of removing half the opposition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> and allowing Julian to focus his resources on dealing with the Alamanni.|$|E

25|$|Over the {{remaining}} 20 {{years of the}} bond, the annual rate earned is not 16.25%, but rather 7%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> (1+i)20 = 100/25.84, giving 1.07. Over the entire 30 year holding period, the original $5.73 invested increased to $100, so 10% per annum was earned, irrespective of any interest rate changes in between.|$|E
25|$|What {{happens in}} the meantime? Suppose that over the first 10 years of the holding period, {{interest}} rates decline, and the yield-to-maturity on the bond falls to 7%. With 20 years remaining to maturity, {{the price of the}} bond will be 100/1.0720, or $25.84. Even though the yield-to-maturity for the remaining life of the bond is just 7%, and the yield-to-maturity bargained for when the bond was purchased was only 10%, the return earned over the first 10 years is 16.25%. This can be found by evaluating (1+i) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> (1+i)10 = (25.882/5.7389), giving 0.1625.|$|E

This event forms the main part of what became known as Munich betrayal (Czech: Mnichovská zrada) in Czechoslovakia and the rest of Eastern Europe, as the Czech view was that Britain and France pressured them to cede territory in order to prevent a major war that would involve the West. The Western view is that they were pressured in order to save Czechoslovakia from total annihilation.|$|E
25|$|Jaime first teams up {{with the}} Titans in Teen Titans #50 and Blue Beetle #18, {{fighting}} Lobo, along with the group to ensure the launch of a satellite armed with anti-Reach technology. The Reach themselves apparently hire Lobo to keep their facade as benevolent protectors; however, at last, Batman and the Teen Titans believe Jaime. Although criticizing Jaime for his lack of formal training, the Titans extend an invitation to visit and perhaps join the team. The Reach later attempt to remove Jaime <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation,</b> combining the missing A.I. of Jaime's scarab, a new scarab and a Sinestro Corps power ring into the Peacemaker, forcing him to cut the scarab from his spine to ensure that his scarab {{could not be used}} as a weapon again.|$|E
25|$|To {{compute the}} {{intersection}} of the curve defined by the polynomial p with the line of equation ax+by+c = 0, one solves the equation of the line for x (or for y if a = 0). Substituting the result in p, one gets a univariate equation q(y) = 0 (or q(x) = 0, if the equation of the line has been solved in y), each of whose roots is one coordinate of an intersection point. The other coordinate is deduced <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> of the line. The multiplicity of an intersection point is the multiplicity of the corresponding root. There is an intersection point at infinity if the degree of q is lower than the degree of p; the multiplicity of such an intersection point at infinity is the difference of the degrees of p and q.|$|E

25|$|This {{equation}} {{was first}} studied extensively in India, starting with Brahmagupta, {{who developed the}} chakravala method to solve Pell's equation and other quadratic indeterminate equations in his Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta in 628, about a thousand years before Pell's time. His Brahma Sphuta Siddhanta was translated into Arabic in 773 and was subsequently translated into Latin in 1126. Bhaskara II in the 12th century and Narayana Pandit in the 14th century both found general solutions to Pell's equation and other quadratic indeterminate equations. Solutions to specific examples of the Pell equation, such as the Pell numbers arising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>equation</b> with n = 2, had been known for much longer, {{since the time of}} Pythagoras in Greece and to a similar date in India. The name of Pell's equation arose from Leonhard Euler's mistakenly attributing Lord Brouncker's solution of the equation to John Pell.|$|E
