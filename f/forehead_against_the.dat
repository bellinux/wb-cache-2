60|$|The {{door shut}} and Terence walked {{across to the}} window. He leant his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pane.|$|E
60|$|He {{fell on his}} knees, {{and still}} holding her hand he rested his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cool white fingers.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, what is impossible?" [...] murmured {{the young}} man, {{going over to}} the window, and leaning his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold, mist-stained glass.|$|E
60|$|For {{a moment}} he rushed aimlessly and madly about the room, while the priest and the slave {{remained}} upon hands and knees with their <b>foreheads</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> floor.|$|R
60|$|She whispered them at last. Not bravely, at all. Feebly, haltingly, with {{a little}} sob: her <b>forehead</b> pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold iron seat, as if that could help her.|$|R
60|$|Adrian {{clasped his}} hands over his <b>forehead,</b> and leaned <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table.|$|R
60|$|On {{the summit}} he {{fell on his}} knees and knelt {{at the foot of the}} Cross, leaning his aching <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold, dank wood.|$|E
60|$|With his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> window, Armine {{watched and}} did his utmost to repress the eagerness {{that seemed to}} irritate his brother, and at last gave vent to an irrepressible hurrah.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have been}} shot, dear Lena," [...] Heyst {{said in a}} steady voice, while Davidson, at the question, turned away and leaned his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> post of {{the foot of the}} bed.|$|E
6000|$|... “I’ll bang myself <b>against</b> <b>the</b> tree!” he cried, and, rushing up to {{the nearest}} {{hardwood}} tree, he brought his <b>forehead</b> up <b>against</b> <b>the</b> bark. A thump was heard and each time his head went forward another thump followed.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Scale-like {{feathers}} {{around the}} eyes and <b>forehead</b> provide armour <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stings of its prey species.|$|R
60|$|I saw her shrug her {{uncovered}} shoulders impatiently. Her <b>forehead</b> was <b>against</b> <b>the</b> very {{blackness of}} the panes; pulled upward from the beautiful, strong nape of her neck, the twisted mass of her tawny hair was held high upon her head by the arrow of gold.|$|R
6000|$|She {{looked at}} him. [...] "Oh Jude!" [...] Sue bent her <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> {{corner of the}} compartment. [...] "I thought you might do it; and that I was deceiving you. But I didn't mean that!" ...|$|E
60|$|In the {{meanwhile}} the gentleman {{had gone up}} to the mantelpiece, {{right in front of}} the fire, and had laid his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece (which it is a low one, and brought him into the attitude of leap-frog), and had heaved a tremenjous sigh. His hair was long and lightish; and when he laid his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mantelpiece, his hair all fell in a dusty fluff together over his eyes; and when he now turned round and lifted up his head again, it all fell in a dusty fluff together over his ears. This give him a wild appearance, similar to a blasted heath.|$|E
60|$|After {{her mother}} {{had gone to bed}} she turned her light down and resumed her seat by the window, {{pressing}} her hot <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> pane, and losing all sense of the scene without in the whirl of her thoughts.|$|E
6000|$|With {{the curious}} little {{movement}} {{of one who}} sees something he [...] does not like to see, he goes. CLARE is leaning her <b>forehead</b> [...] <b>against</b> <b>the</b> mantel-shelf, seemingly unconscious {{that she is not}} [...] alone. MRS. FULLARTON approaches quietly till she can see [...] CLARE'S face.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I've {{nothing to}} do with it,' she began coldly; but Mrs. Boulte's sobs overcame her, and she {{addressed}} herself to the man. 'I don't know what I am to say, Captain Kurrell. I don't know what I can call you. I think you've you've behaved abominably, and she has cut her <b>forehead</b> terribly <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table.' ...|$|R
40|$|HE SAT on the sidewalk, {{a compact}} little unit; legs crossed {{and his head}} down between his knees. Danny 2 ̆ 7 s <b>forehead</b> pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sidewalk. His back stuck u p into the air, and I could see the bones of his {{vertebrae}} in a straight row marching up to his neck and down again even through the thickness of his jeans. Also, I thought, like the spines {{on the back of}} a dinosaur [...] ...|$|R
60|$|She {{went up to}} {{the window}} and rested her <b>{{forehead}}</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cool pane. She might be ever so strong, she could not help her forehead feeling hot and her eyes being full of tears--tears that did not hurt as they fell.|$|E
60|$|Not {{all at once}} could life return {{into the}} body that had been {{practically}} dead for ten days, and as a result, with no power as yet over my flesh, I gave at the knees, crumpled, pitched sidewise, and gashed my <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall.|$|E
60|$|Mr Dorrit was ashamed. He {{went back}} to the window, and leaned his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> glass for some time. When he turned, he had his {{handkerchief}} in his hand, and he had been wiping his eyes with it, and he looked tired and ill.|$|E
60|$|He {{lay down}} on a couch, and there stayed a long time quite still, his <b>forehead</b> pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wall. His will was already {{beginning}} to recover for a fresh attempt. It was merciful {{that she was going}} away from Cramier, going to where he had in fancy watched her feed her doves. No laws, no fears, not even her commands could stop his fancy from conjuring her up by day and night. He had but to close his eyes, and she was there.|$|R
60|$|Lelop-Aw, having {{ended his}} speech and struck his <b>forehead</b> thrice <b>against</b> <b>the</b> table, as the custom is in Japan, {{sat down with}} great {{complacency}} of mind, and much applause of his adherents, as might be observed by their countenances and their whispers. But the Emperor's behaviour was remarkable; for, during the whole harangue, he appeared equally attentive and uneasy. After a short pause, His Majesty commanded that some other counsellor should deliver his thoughts, either to confirm or object against what had been spoken by Lelop-Aw.|$|R
60|$|Caterina {{kissed her}} old friend coaxingly, but Mrs. Sharp {{was not to}} be 'come over' in that way, and insisted on seeing her former charge in bed, taking away the candle which the poor child had wanted to keep as a companion. But it was {{impossible}} to lie there long with that beating heart; and the little white figure was soon out of bed again, seeking relief in the very sense of chill and uncomfort. It was light enough for her to see about her room, for the moon, nearly at full, was riding high in the heavens among scattered hurrying clouds. Caterina drew aside the window-curtain; and, sitting with her <b>forehead</b> pressed <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cold pane, looked out on the wide stretch of park and lawn.|$|R
6000|$|John Chivery {{dropped into}} the chair nearest the door, and Mr Dorrit {{walked up and down}} the room; rapidly at first; then, more slowly. Once, he went to the window, and stood there with his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> glass. All of a sudden, he turned and said: ...|$|E
60|$|It was Colonel Harris's {{presence}} {{in the room that}} transformed the next instant into a wonderful miracle: for Luke was down on his knees before his simple-souled Lou. She had yielded her hand to him and he had pressed an aching <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> delicately perfumed palm.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was rather}} a sigh than a word and, raising his head, Winton saw {{her eyes closed}} again. Now that the fever had gone, the white {{transparency}} of her cheeks and <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> dark lashes and hair was too startling. Was it a living face, or was its beauty that of death? ...|$|E
60|$|Suddenly {{the girl}} reeled forward. She saved herself from a fall only by {{embracing}} with both arms {{one of the}} tall, roughly carved posts holding the mosquito net above the bed. For a long time she clung to it, with her <b>forehead</b> leaning <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wood. One side of her loosened sarong had slipped down as low as her hip. The long brown tresses of her hair fell in lank wisps, as if wet, almost black against her white body. Her uncovered flank, damp with the sweat of anguish and fatigue, gleamed coldly with the immobility of polished marble in the hot, diffused light falling through the window above her head--a dim reflection of the consuming, passionate blaze of sunshine outside, all aquiver with the effort to set the earth on fire, to burn it to ashes.|$|R
60|$|The restlessness {{that had}} driven {{her up and}} down the stairs, and {{backward}} and forward in the hall, left her as suddenly as it had come. She waited through the second interval, leaning on the window-sill, and staring, without conscious thought of any kind, into the black night. The howling of a belated dog was borne toward her on the wind, at intervals, from some distant part of the suburb. She found herself following the faint sound as it died away into silence with a dull attention, and listening for its coming again with an expectation that was duller still. Her arms lay like lead on the window-sill; her <b>forehead</b> rested <b>against</b> <b>the</b> glass without feeling the cold. It was not till the moon struggled out again that she was startled into sudden self-remembrance. She turned quickly, and looked at the clock; seven minutes had passed since the second Pouring.|$|R
50|$|A deer rub {{describes}} the abrasions {{caused by a}} male deer rubbing his <b>forehead</b> and antlers <b>against</b> <b>the</b> base of a tree. Easy to spot in areas with high deer populations, hunters use them to find ideal locations for hunting. They appear {{in the late summer}} or early fall, when male deer rub the velvet off their newly acquired antler growth or during rut season. The area between the forehead and antlers contains a large number of apocrine sweat glands, and leave a scent that communicates a challenge to other male deer while also attracting potential mates. The size of the rub usually varies with the size of the deer.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{struggled}} up. At first I was as incapable as a swathed infant--stepping with limbs I {{could not}} see. I was weak and very hungry. I went {{and stared at}} nothing in my shaving-glass, at nothing save where an attenuated pigment still remained behind the retina of my eyes, fainter than mist. I had {{to hang on to}} the table and press my <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> glass.|$|E
6000|$|STRANGWAY. [Turning away] God!--if {{there be}} one help me! [He stands leaning his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> window. Suddenly his glance {{falls on the}} little bird cage, still lying on the window-seat] Never cage any wild thing! [He gives a laugh that is half a sob; then, turning to the door, says in a low voice] Go! Go please, quickly! Do what you will. I won't hurt you--can't----But--go! [He opens the door.] ...|$|E
6000|$|A priest burst {{suddenly}} {{through the}} hangings {{of the doorway}} and falling upon {{his hands and knees}} rubbed his <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stone flagging. [...] "O Jad-ben-Otho," [...] he cried, [...] "the warriors of Ja-don have attacked the palace and the temple. Even now they are fighting in the corridors near the quarters of Lu-don, and the high priest begs that you come to the palace and encourage your faithful warriors by your presence." ...|$|E
6000|$|While affairs stood thus, Charles VIII died {{suddenly}} at Amboise in April {{of that year}} 1498. Some work was being carried out there by artists whom he had brought from Naples for the purpose, and, in going to visit this, the king happened to enter a dark gallery, and struck his <b>forehead</b> so violently <b>against</b> <b>the</b> edge of a door that he expired the same day--at the age of twenty-eight. He was a poor, malformed fellow, as we have seen, and [...] "of little understanding," [...] Commines tells us, [...] "but so good {{that it would have}} been impossible to have found a kinder creature." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{was an only}} child, {{and lost}} his mother early. He was very ill brought up, and was as impetuous and violent as Sir Guy himself, though with much kindliness and generosity. He was only {{nineteen}} when he made a runaway marriage with a girl of sixteen, the sister of a violin player, who {{was at that time}} in fashion. His father was very much offended, and there was much dreadfully violent conduct on each side. At last, the young man was driven to seek a reconciliation. He brought his wife to Moorworth, and rode to Redclyffe, to have an interview with his father. Unhappily, Sir Guy was giving a dinner to the hunt, and had been drinking. He not only refused to see him, but I am afraid he used shocking language, and said something about bidding him go back to his fiddling brother in-law. The son was waiting in the hall, heard everything, threw himself on his horse, and rushed away in the dark. His <b>forehead</b> struck <b>against</b> <b>the</b> branch of a tree, and he was killed on the spot.' ...|$|R
60|$|Aaron replied by {{rubbing his}} <b>forehead</b> <b>against</b> his mother's shoulder.|$|R
