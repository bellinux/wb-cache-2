5|$|A {{group of}} thieves stole, {{on a summer}} day, horses {{that belonged to the}} Monastery of StJovan Vladimir. When they came to the nearby stream of Kusha to take the horses across, it {{appeared}} to them like an enormous river.

5|$|A {{survival}} horror storyline {{usually involves}} {{the investigation and}} confrontation of horrific forces, and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges. Early releases utilized camera angles seen <b>in</b> <b>horror</b> films, which allowed enemies to lurk {{in areas that are}} concealed from the player's view. Also, many survival horror games make use of off-screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger. This feedback assists the player, but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the films}} were not popular with critics, Friday the 13th is {{considered}} one of the most successful media franchises in America—not only for the success of the films, but also because of the extensive merchandising and repeated references to the series in popular culture. The franchise's popularity has generated a fanbase who have created their own Friday the 13th films, fashioned replica Jason Voorhees costumes, and tattooed their bodies with Friday the 13th artwork. Jason's hockey mask has become one of the most recognizable images <b>in</b> <b>horror</b> and popular culture.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured <b>in</b> <b>horror</b> fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E
5|$|Clock Tower was commercially successful, selling {{close to}} half a million copies. Kono {{attributed}} some of this success to Resident Evil generating interest <b>in</b> <b>horror</b> games {{and the success of}} the PlayStation. Critical reviews of Clock Tower were mixed. The game's horror atmosphere and storyline were praised, although most other aspects were found to be mediocre. Most of the negative critique was directed towards the game's slow pace, which was compared unfavorably to other PlayStation games of the era, particularly the more action-oriented and fast-paced Resident Evil. These factors influenced some critics to recommend Clock Tower purely for point-and-click adventure fans.|$|E

5|$|In his 1931 study, Mavrodinov {{also writes}} {{that at the}} time, the church lacked a roof. He {{references}} {{a story about a}} group of Circassians that were settled in Sapareva Banya on the order of the Ottoman authorities after the Crimean War (1853–1856). According to that story, the Circassians sought to pull down the church's roof.

5|$|On the film's {{release in}} 1957, it became Italy's first horror {{film of the}} sound era. It was not {{successful}} in Italy, which Freda interpreted as an audience not interested <b>in</b> <b>horror</b> films made by Italians. The film was released theatrically as The Devil's Commandment and Lust of the Vampire in the United States and United Kingdom respectively. English critics predominantly discuss the film {{in terms of its}} cinematography and place in film history. Despite being the first of the Italian horror films, {{it was not until the}} British film Dracula (1958) and the international hit Black Sunday were released that a greater amount of horror films began being produced in Italy.|$|E
