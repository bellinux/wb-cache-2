25|$|In {{addition}} to spiders, silkworms are {{another source of}} silk. Protein from Bombyx mori silkworms is a core of fibroin protein surrounded by sericin, which is a family of glue-like proteins. Fibroin has been characterized as a heavy chain with a repeated hydrophobic and crystallizable sequence: Gly-Ala-Gly-Ala-Gly-X (X stands for Ser or Tyr). The surrounding sericin is more hydrophilic due to many polar residues, but it does still have some hydrophobic β-sheet portions. Silks have been long been used as sutures due to their high mechanical strength and flexibility as well as permeability to water and oxygen. In addition, silk fibroin can be easily manipulated and sterilized. However, silk use halted when undesirable immunological reactions were reported. Recently, it has been discovered {{that the cause of}} the immunological problems lies solely with the surrounding sericin. Since this discovery, silk with the sericin removed has been used in many pharmaceutical and biomedical applications. Because it is necessary to remove the sericin from around the fibroin before the silk can be used, an efficient procedure needs to be developed for its removal, which is known as <b>degumming.</b> One degrumming method uses boiling aqueous Na2CO3 solution, which removes the sericin without damaging the fibroin. Yang, Chen et al. demonstrated that the silk fibroin and silk fibroin extract fluid show good biocompatibility with Schwann cells, with no cytotoxic effects on proliferation.|$|E
25|$|Biocompatibility, i.e., {{the ability}} to what level the silk will cause an immune response, is {{definitely}} a critical issue for biomaterials. The biocompatibility of silk arose during its increasing clinical use. Indeed, wax or silicone is usually used as a coating to avoid fraying and potential immune responses when silk fibers serve as suture materials. Although the lack of detailed characterization of silk fibers, such as {{the extent of the}} removal of sericin, the surface chemical properties of coating material, and the process used, make it difficult to determine the real immune response of silk fibers in literature, it is generally believed that sericin is the major cause of immune response. Thus, the removal of sericin is an essential step to assure biocompatibility in biomaterial applications of silk. However, further research fails to prove clearly the contribution of sericin to inflammatory responses based on isolated sericin and sericin based biomaterials. In addition, silk fibroin exhibits an inflammatory response similar to that of tissue culture plastic in vitro when assessed with human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) or lower than collagen and PLA when implant rat MSCs with silk fibroin films in vivo. Thus, appropriate <b>degumming</b> and sterilization will assure the biocompatibility of silk fibroin, which is further validated by in vivo experiments on rats and pigs. There are still concerns about the long-term safety of silk-based biomaterials in the human body in contrast to these promising results. Even though silk sutures serve well, they exist and interact within a limited period depending on the recovery of wounds (several weeks), much shorter than that in tissue engineering. Another concern arises from biodegradation because the biocompatibility of silk fibroin does not necessarily assure the biocompatibility of the decomposed products. In fact, different levels of immune responses and diseases have been triggered by the degraded products of silk fibroin.|$|E

50|$|Recent archaeological {{discoveries in}} Harappa and Chanhu-daro suggest that sericulture, {{employing}} wild silk threads from native silkworm species, existed in South Asia {{during the time}} of the Indus Valley Civilization dating between 2450 BC and 2000 BC, while evidence for silk production in China back to around 2570 BC and earlier. The Indus silks were obtained from more than one species Antheraea and Philosamia (Eri silk). Antheraea assamensis and A. mylitta were widely used. It is widely believed that silk process techniques of <b>degumming</b> and reeling were purely Chinese technology. These findings were published in the journal Archaeometry by archaeologists from Harvard University who examined the silk fibre excavated from two Indus valley cities of Harappa and Chanhudaro. The fibers were dated to around 2450-2000 BCE and were processed using similar techniques of <b>degumming</b> and reeling as that of the Chinese.

5000|$|Unlike most fabric/yard goods {{which are}} {{sold by the}} yard (or metre), silk is sold to the {{wholesaler}} by weight. The first step in processing the silk fiber is [...] "degumming the fibre," [...] the gum being a byproduct of {{the production of the}} silk fibre by the worm. Approximately one-fifth of the weight of the silk fibre is lost in the <b>degumming</b> process, and manufacturers felt they had the [...] "right" [...] to replace this lost weight with a filler of some sort. Silk has an affinity for several metallic salts, the most common of which being iron, lead, and tin. It was discovered to be an easy process to return this weight lost in the <b>degumming</b> process by soaking the fibre in a bath of these metallic salts. This process was called weighting, and by increasing the weight of the raw silk, the merchant increased his profit. Weighting with some metallic salts did improve the drapeability of the fibre; however greedy merchants soon began adding more weight than the lost one-fifth; sometimes the final weight was increased tenfold.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background <b>Degummed</b> silk fibroin from Bombyx mori (silkworm) has {{potential}} carrier capabilities for drug delivery in humans; however, the processing methods {{have yet to}} be comparatively analyzed to determine the differential effects on the silk protein properties, including crystalline structure and activity. Methods In this study, we treated <b>degummed</b> silk with four kinds of calcium-alcohol solutions, and performed secondary structure measurements and enzyme activity test to distinguish the differences between the regenerated fibroins and <b>degummed</b> silk fibroin. Results Gel electrophoresis analysis revealed that Ca(NO 3) 2 -methanol, Ca(NO 3) 2 -ethanol, or CaCl 2 -methanol treatments produced more lower molecular weights of silk fibroin than CaCl 2 -ethanol. X-ray diffraction and Fourier-transform infrared spectroscopy showed that CaCl 2 -ethanol produced a crystalline structure with more silk I (α-form, type II β-turn), while the other treatments produced more silk II (β-form, anti-parallel β-pleated sheet). Solid-State 13 C cross polarization and magic angle spinning-nuclear magnetic resonance measurements suggested that regenerated fibroins from CaCl 2 -ethanol were nearly identical to <b>degummed</b> silk fibroin, while the other treatments produced fibroins with significantly different chemical shifts. Finally, enzyme activity test indicated that silk fibroins from CaCl 2 -ethanol had higher activity when linked to a known chemotherapeutic drug, L-asparaginase, than the fibroins from other treatments. Conclusions Collectively, these results suggest that the CaCl 2 -ethanol processing method produces silk fibroin with biomaterial properties that are appropriate for drug delivery. </p...|$|R

We describe the effects of <b>degummed</b> silk fibers as well as extracted sericin on cell metabolism and proliferation. Endothelial cells directly exposed to native <b>degummed</b> Bombyx mori and Antheraea pernyi silks showed lower rates of proliferation and metabolism than nonexposed cells.

40|$|Methanolysis of {{rapeseed}} and {{soybean oil}} was studied using organic basic catalysts at boiling with reflux. The molar ratio methanol/free fatty acids (FFA) amounted to approx 2. 8 : 1. The catalyst (guanidine carbonate) is used at concentrations between 0. 5 and 1. 3 wt-% {{with respect to}} the oil. During boiling at reflux, guanidine carbonate disintegrates into guanidine and gaseous carbon dioxide. This is a very special reaction; other alcohols such as ethanol, propanol, etc. do not react in this way with guanidine carbonate. Under these conditions, the reaction mixture consists of two phases.
