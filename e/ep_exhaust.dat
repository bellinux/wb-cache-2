40|$|A {{document}} highlights a {{means to}} complement remote spectroscopy while also providing in situ surface samples without a landed system. Historically, most compositional analysis of small body surfaces has been done remotely by analyzing reflection or nuclear spectra. However, neither provides direct measurement that can unambiguously constrain the global surface composition and most importantly, the nature of trace composition and second-phase impurities. Recently, missions such as Deep Space 1 and Dawn have utilized electric propulsion (EP) accelerated, high-energy collimated beam of Xe+ ions to propel deep space missions to their target bodies. The energies of the Xe+ are sufficient to cause sputtering interactions, which eject material from the top microns of a targeted surface. Using a mass spectrometer, the sputtered material can be determined. The sputtering properties of <b>EP</b> <b>exhaust</b> {{can be used to}} determine detailed surface composition of atmosphereless bodies by electric propulsion induced secondary mass spectroscopy (EPI-SMS). EPI-SMS operation has three high-level requirements: EP system, mass spectrometer, and altitude of about 10 km. Approximately 1 keV Xe+ has been studied and proven to generate high sputtering yields in metallic substrates. Using these yields, first-order calculations predict that EPI-SMS will yield high signal-to-noise at altitudes greater than 10 km with both electrostatic and Hall thrusters...|$|E

5000|$|... 2006 {{the band}} is {{nominated}} for “Best Electronic Rock” category for the Inland Empire Music Awards, and starts recording the new <b>EP</b> titled “Movement.” <b>Exhausted</b> in working with several engineers and producers, it is decided that ROOM 1202 will produce themselves. This is the first recording using live drums, as well as using utilizing two studios, one for recording, and one for mixing. Michael Buchanan leaves again due to personal reasons, and the band continues recording and does sporadic shows {{for the rest of}} year as a three-piece. Hopes to spark interest in ROOM 1202, Omar accepts collaboration remixes for the song WEAK from Beau Baker, keyboardist and drummer for Los Angeles-based Depeche Mode Tribute band VIOLATOR, as well as from synth-pop/darkwave band CARVED SOULS. ROOM 1202 decides to release a new single available {{for the first time on}} iTunes in the early part of 2007.|$|R
