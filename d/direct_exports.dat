40|$|The {{indirect}} export route {{can often}} provide a low risk first {{stage in the}} internationalization process. Many enterprises, however, can become locked into the indirect export route and do not progress to <b>direct</b> <b>export.</b> It {{has been suggested that}} indirect exporting in China can be a double edged sword, and that it may prevent the accumulation of international experience and knowledge that organizations need to develop further. The aim of this research is to identify which of the selected barriers to export represent the greatest increase in perception of difficulty when considering the transition from indirect to <b>direct</b> <b>export.</b> This research identifies a range of 17 barriers that impact on small to medium sized enterprise (SME) export, from the export stream of literature, and then measures the perceptions of decision makers in the difficulty in overcoming these barriers when using the indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>export</b> routes. The differences in perception of the individual barriers between the export routes are a measure of the difficulty, through gaps in knowledge and resource, in moving from indirect to <b>direct</b> <b>export.</b> The research methodology adopted a quantitative approach and data was collected from 98 SME decision makers in the Chinese province of Ningxia, and was then subjected to statistical analysis. The findings include the wide differences in the perception of difficulty in accessing foreign distribution channels, the ability to obtain and understand information to operate in new markets, and finding reliable local representation when moving from indirect to <b>direct</b> <b>export.</b> In addition, two of the barriers are perceived as more difficult when using indirect <b>export</b> compared to <b>direct</b> <b>export...</b>|$|R

5000|$|The {{countries}} in the Caribbean Basin import relative high quantities of Brazilian ethanol, but not much is destined for domestic consumption. These countries reprocess the product, usually converting Brazilian hydrated ethanol into anhydrous ethanol, and then re-export it to the United States, gaining value-added and avoiding the 2.5% duty and the [...] per gallon tariff, thanks to the trade agreements and benefits granted by Caribbean Basin Initiative (CBI). This process is limited by a quota, set at 7% of U.S. ethanol consumption. Although direct U.S. exports fell in 2007, imports from four CBI countries almost doubled, increasing from 15.5% in 2006 to 25.8% in 2007, reflecting increasing re-exports to the U.S., thus partially compensating the loss of Brazilian <b>direct</b> <b>exports</b> to the U.S. This situation has caused some concerns in the United States, as it and Brazil are {{trying to build a}} partnership to increase ethanol production in Latin American and the Caribbean.

Innovative firms in particular seem to increase the export rate in competitive and dynamic markets (Boso et al. 2013). Despite the subcontractors’ liabilities in terms of <b>direct</b> <b>exports,</b> it may be argued that innovation strategies decrease dependency on system providers, because of the innovative firms’ attractiveness in international export markets.|$|E
