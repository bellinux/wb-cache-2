All enterococcal blood culture isolates at Royal Brisbane Hospital have been screened by agar dilution for <b>high</b> <b>level</b> {{resistance to}} gentamicin and strepto-mycin since 1989. Of 110 isolates of Enterococcus faecalis, 16 % displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to gentamicin and 10 % showed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to streptomycin. Four isolates had <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistance to both antibiotics. None of 23 Enterococcus faecium isolates displayed <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resis-tance to gentamicin and only one to streptomycin. Two Enterococcus faecium isolates were resistant to amoxycillin but none to vancomycin. There has been no apparent increase in <b>high</b> <b>level</b> aminoglycoside resistance from 1989 to 1996. <b>High</b> <b>level</b> gentamicin resistant isolates were relatively more common in liver transplant patients. Like vancomycin-resistant enterococci, isolates that are <b>high</b> <b>level</b> resistant to aminoglycosides can be spread by the hands of staff members. Preventing the nosocomial transmission of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> aminoglycoside-resistant entero-cocci follows the same general principles of preventing transmission of other resistant enterococci.

40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship between language brokering and its effects on the level of stress of the brokers. Specifically, the relationships between language brokering, parentification, stress, and gender were explored. Gender differences in the strength of this relationship were also examined. The following was expected: <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering would correlate positively with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress; <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification would correlate with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress; and that both brokering and parentification were gender specific, with female subjects reporting <b>higher</b> <b>levels.</b> The participants were 90 Latino undergrad students attending universities in the New York City area. The students completed several self-report measures including a parentification questionnaire, a language-brokering questionnaire, and stress scales. ^ Results showed that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of language brokering were positively correlated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification. Although no gender differences were found for levels of language brokering, females reported <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification. Those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of brokering did not report <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress. However, those who reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of parentification reported <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of stress. The {{results of the present study}} emphasized the need for understanding the ramifications and long-term consequences of language brokering, particularly for the Latino community. While brokering itself may not lead to a heightened degree of stress, cultural nuances within the Latino community serve to further perpetuate the pressures associated with brokering. As such, once a pattern of brokering has been established and identified, interventions must be developed to decrease the occurrence of long term impairment of individual and family functioning. ...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT-In present time’s <b>High</b> <b>level</b> clones (HLC) is an {{emerging}} concept {{that uses a}} hierarchical organization of fine gained clone fragments (Simple clones) to form coarser-grained clones (<b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone). Different research groups categorize clones with respect to different contexts. In this paper we review all such available categories of clones and present them {{in the form of}} a <b>High</b> <b>Level</b> Clone Classification. Classification can serve various purposes like studying the more frequently occurring <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, prioritizing different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones, devising re-engineering strategies for different types of <b>high</b> <b>level</b> clones etc [...] For this classification of HLC we develop a fuzzy rule-based system and also visualize the results.

40|$|The aim of {{our study}} was to {{identify}} perceptions of built and social residential characteristics and their association with behaviors such as physical activity (PA), nutrition and smoking and with cardiovascular risk factors (elevated BMI and fasting blood glucose). Among participants of a preventive medical checkup at an Austrian District Health Insurance Fund (n= 904, response rate = 82. 2 %, 42 % women, 18 - 91 years) self-reported and measured data were collected. Total PA was positively associated with the presence of trees along the streets and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of pro-physical activity social modeling (SM) and it was negatively related to perceived safety from crime. More leisure-time PA was associated with <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of cycling/walking infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. PA for transportation was positively related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of connectivity and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. Better behavioral cardiovascular risk factor profiles (smoking and nutrition) were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of total PA. Lower BMI values were associated with <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of infrastructure and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of SM. Both built and social residential characteristics are important correlates of PA as well as of major cardiovascular risk factors besides PA...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addressed}} {{the relationships among}} professional efficacy, emotional exhaustion, and job characteristics (job demands and job control) {{in the context of}} a two-wave panel study among 828 Dutch police officers. Based on the demand-control model, we expected that high demands/high control would be positively related to professional efficacy, and that high demands/low control would be related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion. Moreover, we hypothesized that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion would lead to lower levels of professional efficacy and that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy would lead to low levels of exhaustion. Structural equation modelling largely supported these predictions. High demands were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy and <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion; <b>high</b> control was longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of efficacy. Further, efficacy and exhaustion were indeed mutually related. Finally, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of exhaustion were longitudinally related to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of demands. We conclude that there are complex, yet theoretically, and practically interpretable relations among efficacy, strain and work characteristics. © 2010 The British Psychological Society...|$|R

40|$|There are {{tradeoffs}} to <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> {{of approach}} motivation. On the one hand, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of approach motivation {{are thought to}} underlie positive emotional states such as excitement (Watson, Wiese, Vaidya, & Tellegen, 1999). <b>High</b> <b>levels</b> of approach motivation should also invigorate goal pursuit (Higgins, 1997) and potentially facilitate progress as a result (Carver & Scheier, 1998). On the other hand, Gray (1982) suggested that <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of approach motivation predispose one to a certain class of dysregulated outcomes. Increasingly so, and consistent with the latter perspective, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of approach motivation {{have been linked to}} addictive behaviors (Franken, Muris, & Georgieva, 2006), anger and aggression (Carver & Harmon-Jones, 2009), and bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2006). Nonetheless, <b>high</b> <b>levels</b> of self-reported approach moti-vation, considered alone, may often not predict its problem-atic manifestations. For example, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of self-control should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation results in addiction (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994). Similarly, better neurological functioning should mitigate the extent to which approach motivation predicts bipolar symptoms (Alloy et al., 2009). Finally, <b>higher</b> <b>levels</b> of BIS (the Behavioral Inhibition System; Gray, 1982) are thought to mitigate the pernicious outcomes predicted by highe...|$|R
