CrPV does not appear to infect locusts. It is a commonly detected virus in honeybees as an <b>inapparent</b> infection. The strain CrPVbrk was isolated from the cricket A. domesticus ca.1980 following a major population collapse at a cricket rearing farm in Georgia. A related virus from Arkansas, initially called Pseudoplusia includens virus and redesignated CrPVark, was recorded in the mid-1980s. The brk and ark strains are closely related serologically but appear to be very distantly related to the other CrPV isolates so, despite their physical and chemical similarities, it remains speculative that these two American isolates are actually strains of CrPV. Reported detections and/or isolations of CrPV have been made in Australia, New Zealand, the United States of America, the United Kingdom and Indonesia. CrPV has one of the widest host-ranges, if not the widest, of any virus, insect or not. The potential for the use of CrPV as a biological control agent for insects has been suggested.

40|$|Dengue {{is a major}} {{international}} public health concern {{and the number of}} outbreaks has escalated greatly. Human migration, international trade and travel are constantly introducing new vectors and pathogens into novel geographic areas. Of particular interest {{is the extent to which}} dengue virus (DENV) infections are subclinical or <b>inapparent.</b> Not only may such infections contribute to the global spread of DENV by human migration, but also seroprevalence rates in naïve populations may be initially high despite minimal numbers of detectable clinical cases. As the probability of severe disease is increased in secondary infections, populations may thus be primed, with serious public health consequences following introduction of a new serotype. In addition, pre-existing immunity from <b>inapparent</b> infections may affect vaccine uptake and the ratio of clinically apparent to <b>inapparent</b> infection could affect the interpretation of vaccine trials. We performed a literature search for <b>inapparent</b> DENV infections and provide an analytical review of their frequency and associated risk factors. <b>Inapparent</b> rates were highly variable, but <b>inapparent</b> was the major outcome of infection in all prospective studies.

40|$|Dengue viruses are a {{major cause}} of illness and hospitalizations in {{tropical}} and subtropical regions of the world.

40|$|Background: Dengue viruses are a {{major cause}} of {{morbidity}} in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. <b>Inapparent</b> dengue is {{an important component of the}} overall burden of dengue infection. It provides a source of infection for mosquito transmission during the course of an epidemic, yet by definition is undetected by health care providers. Previous studies of <b>inapparent</b> or subclinical infection have reported varying ratios of symptomatic to <b>inapparent</b> dengue infection. Methodology/Principal Findings: In a prospective study of school children in Northern Thailand, we describe the spatial and temporal variation of the symptomatic to <b>inapparent</b> (S:I) dengue illness ratio. Our findings indicate that there is a wide fluctuation in this ratio between and among schools in a given year and within schools over several dengue seasons. The most important determinants of this S:I ratio for a given school were the incidence of dengue infection in a given year and the incidence of infection in the preceding year. We found no association between the S:I ratio and age in our population. Conclusions/Significance: Our findings point to an important aspect of virus-host interactions at either a population or individual level possibly due to an effect of heterotypic cross-reactive immunity to reduce dengue disease severity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Dengue {{has emerged}} as the most {{important}} vector-borne viral disease in tropical areas. Evaluations of the burden and severity of dengue disease have been hindered by the frequent lack of laboratory confirmation and strong selection bias toward more severe cases. METHODOLOGY: A multinational, prospective clinical study was carried out in South-East Asia (SEA) and Latin America (LA), to ascertain the proportion of <b>inapparent</b> dengue infections in households of febrile dengue cases, and to compare clinical data and biological markers from subjects with various dengue disease patterns. Dengue infection was laboratory-confirmed during the acute phase, by virus isolation and detection of the genome. The four participating reference laboratories used standardized methods. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Among 215 febrile dengue subjects- 114 in SEA and 101 in LA- 28 (13. 0 %) were diagnosed with severe dengue (from SEA only) using the WHO definition. Household investigations were carried out for 177 febrile subjects. Among household members {{at the time of the}} first home visit, 39 acute dengue infections were detected of which 29 were <b>inapparent.</b> A further 62 dengue cases were classified at early convalescent phase. Therefore, 101 dengue infections were found among the 408 household members. Adding these together with the 177 Dengue Index Cases, the overall proportion of dengue infections among the study participants was estimated at 47. 5 % (278 / 585; 95 % CI 43. 5 - 51. 6). Lymphocyte counts and detection of the NS 1 antigen differed significantly between <b>inapparent</b> and symptomatic dengue subjects; among <b>inapparent</b> cases lymphocyte counts were normal and only 20 % were positive for NS 1 antigen.

Further analysis of the EIAV genome, with primer pairs diagnostic for sequential stages of reverse transcription, suggests that EIAV DNA in the brain, liver, and lymph nodes was incompletely synthesized. The products of reverse transcription were found to diminish progressively during first-strand synthesis, while products indicative of second-strand synthesis were observed only in kidney and spleen DNA samples. Sequences specific for different regions of the envelope could not be amplified from any of the tissues of the <b>inapparent</b> carrier, suggesting that the envelope is highly variable and may be subject to extensive drift.

40|$|Lentiviruses are {{single-stranded}} RNA viruses generally {{associated with}} chronic {{diseases of the}} immune and central nervous systems. In contrast to the insidious, progressive nature of most lentiviral diseases, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) infection results in rapid onset of a variable disease course in equids. Acute disease is accompanied with high-titered viremia, thrombocytopenia, fever, depression, and inappetance. The chronic stage is usually characterized by recurrent episodes of disease. Equids that survive recurrent disease episodes progress to the <b>inapparent</b> stage of disease where no clinical signs are evident; however, there is persistent, ongoing virus replication. Lentiviruses exist within the host as a population of closely related genotypes, termed a quasispecies. Variation in the virus surface unit envelope glycoprotein (SU) has been demonstrated to contribute to immune evasion of host responses during chronic disease. However, {{little is known about}} the SU genotypes and phenotypes associated with disease progression to the <b>inapparent</b> stage of disease. The goal of this research is a genotypic and phenotypic characterization of the SU quasispecies during clinical and <b>inapparent</b> stages of disease. To accomplish this goal, I undertook a longitudinal study of SU variation in a pony experimentally inoculated with the virulent, wild-type, EIAVWyo. There was a marked increase in quasispecies diversity and divergence that coincided with maturation of the immune response and progression to the <b>inapparent</b> stage of disease. Variation was characterized by point mutations in each SU variable region as well as deletion/insertions within the principal neutralizing domain (PND). Genotypes representative of predominant PND variants were used to construct chimeric proviral clones for virus neutralization assays. A type-specific virus neutralizing antibody response was associated with resolution of acute disease. Variants predominant at later stages of disease showed increasing resistance to both type- and group-specific neutralizing antibody. Variants most resistant to group-specific antibody showed reduced replication fitness in vitro. These studies provide evidence that neutralizing antibody selects for resistant SU variants and thereby plays an important role in immune control of virus replication during the <b>inapparent</b> stage of disease...|$|E

40|$|Persistent {{infection}} of equids by equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) is typically {{characterized by a}} progression {{during the first year}} postinfection from chronic disease with recurring disease cycles to a long-term asymptomatic infection that is maintained indefinitely. The goal of the current study was to perform a comprehensive longitudinal analysis of the course of virus infection and development of host immunity in experimentally infected horses as they progressed from chronic disease to long-term <b>inapparent</b> carriage. We previously described the evolution of EIAV genomic quasispecies (C. Leroux, C. J. Issel, and R. C. Montelaro, J. Virol. 71 : 9627 – 9639, 1997) and host immune responses (S. A. Hammond, S. J. Cook, D. L. Lichtenstein, C. J. Issel, and R. C. Montelaro, J. Virol. 71 : 3840 – 3852, 1997) in four experimentally infected ponies during sequential disease episodes associated with chronic disease during the first 10 months postinfection. In the current study, we extended the studies of these experimentally infected ponies to 3 years postinfection to characterize the levels of virus replication and development of host immune responses associated with the progression from chronic disease to long-term <b>inapparent</b> infection. The results of these studies revealed over a 103 -fold difference in the steady-state levels of plasma viral RNA detected during long-term <b>inapparent</b> infection that correlated with the severity of chronic disease, indicating different levels of control of virus replication during long-term <b>inapparent</b> infections. Detailed analyses of antibody and cellular immune responses in all four ponies over the 3 -year course of infection revealed a similar evolution during the first year post{{infection of}} robust humoral and cellular immunity that then remained relatively constant during long-term <b>inapparent</b> infection. These observations indicate that immune parameters that have previously been correlated with EIAV vaccine protection fail to provide reliable immune correlates of control of virus replication or clinical outcome in experimental infections. Thus, these data emphasize the differences between immunity to virus exposure and immune control of an established viral infection and further emphasize the need to develop and evaluate novel immunoassays to define reliable immune correlates to vaccine and infection immunity, respectively...|$|E

In addition, EK cells did not express MHC class II molecules. The CTLm frequency in PBMC from five <b>inapparent</b> carriers infected for 22 to 50 months was determined by limiting dilution analysis. PBMC were diluted, stimulated, and tested on EK cell targets infected with EIAV and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing EIAV Env or Gag/Pr proteins. All five carriers had CTLm to EIAV-infected targets, while four had CTLm to targets expressing Env and four had CTLm to targets expressing Gag/Pr proteins. The CTLm frequency range was 60 to 468 per 106 PBMC to EIAV-infected targets, 4 to 286 to Env-expressing targets, and 25 to 190 to Gag/Pr-expressing targets. These results should facilitate the identification of epitopes recognized by predominant CTLm from horses controlling a lentivirus infection...|$|E
