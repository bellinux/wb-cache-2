5|$|Jewell's {{first order}} as Secretary, issued in October 2013, {{established}} {{a process for}} the Department of the Interior to offset large development projects with conservation efforts. The effort was an extension of <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> that use fees for offshore drilling permits to expand or build parks. At the same time, Jewell publicly pledged to work with President Obama to preserve mountains and rivers, with or without Congressional action. Existing laws, such as the 1906 Antiquities Act, give the president broad authority to preserve land, a power Jewell indicated she and the President were prepared to use {{as part of a}} balanced approach between development and conservation.|$|E
5|$|To {{administer}} {{the newly created}} National Register of Historic Places, the National Park Service of the U.S. Department of the Interior, with director George B. Hartzog Jr., established an administrative division named the Office of Archeology and Historic Preservation (OAHP). Hartzog charged OAHP with creating the National Register program mandated by the 1966 law. Ernest Connally was the Office's first director. Within OAHP new divisions were created {{to deal with the}} National Register. The division administered several <b>existing</b> <b>programs,</b> including the Historic Sites Survey and the Historic American Buildings Survey, as well as the new National Register and Historic Preservation Fund.|$|E

The quasi-opportunistic approach goes beyond volunteer computing on a highly distributed systems such as BOINC, or general grid computing on a system such as Globus by allowing the middleware to provide almost seamless access to many computing clusters so that <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> in languages such as Fortran or C can be distributed among multiple computing resources.|$|E
25|$|Founded in 1764, the College is {{the oldest}} school of Brown University. About 6,400 {{undergraduate}} students are currently enrolled in the College, and 79 concentrations (majors) are offered. Completed concentrations of undergraduates by area are social sciences 42 percent, humanities 26 percent, life sciences 17 percent, and physical sciences 14 percent. The concentrations with {{the greatest number of}} students are Biology, History, and International Relations. Brown {{is one of the few}} schools in the United States with an undergraduate concentration (major) in Egyptology. Undergraduates can also design an independent concentration if the <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> do not align with their curricular focus.|$|E

Since the release of GNOME 3.0, The GNOME Project concentrates on developing a set of programs that accounts for the GNOME Core Applications. The commonalities of the GNOME Core Applications are the adherence to the current GNOME HUD guidelines as well as the tight integration with underlying GNOME layers like e.g. GVfs and also with one another e.g. GOA (gnome-online-accounts) settings and GNOME Files with Google Drive and GNOME Photos with Google Photos. Some programs are simply renamed <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> with a revamped user interface, while others have been written from scratch.|$|E
25|$|The {{effectiveness}} of anger management {{has been studied}} {{in children and adolescents}} for the purpose of evaluating <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> and designing more effective programs. In a meta-analyses of 40 studies, an overall effect size of 0.67 was found for CBT anger management treatment, suggesting anger management as a legitimate approach to problematic levels of anger. Skills development (0.79) and problem solving (0.67) both had a higher impact than affective education (0.36). This was believed to be due to behavioral aspects being more easily conveyed than cognitive for children. The true value from early interventions aimed at youths comes from the preventative aspect. Curbing negative behaviors early in life could lead to a more positive outlook as an adult.|$|E
25|$|In 1991, Linus Torvalds, a Finnish student, {{used the}} GNU's {{development}} tools {{to produce the}} free monolithic Linux kernel. The <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> from the GNU project were readily ported to run on the resultant platform. Most sources use the name Linux {{to refer to the}} general-purpose operating system thus formed, while Stallman and the FSF call it GNU/Linux. This has been a longstanding naming controversy in the free software community. Stallman argues that not using GNU {{in the name of the}} operating system unfairly disparages the value of the GNU project and harms the sustainability of the free software movement by breaking the link between the software and the free software philosophy of the GNU project.|$|E

25|$|Supporters {{believe that}} this plan will be an {{important}} part of what Bush set in place while in office. However, the policy has been criticized on two fronts. Firstly, critics have opined that the United States should deal with solving domestic issues before concentrating on space exploration. Secondly, of the funding {{over the next five years}} that Bush has proposed, only US$1 billion will be in new appropriations while the remaining US$11 billion will be reallocated from NASA's other programs, and therefore inadequate to fully realize this vision. Most of the spending for the new program, and most of the budget cuts for <b>existing</b> <b>programs,</b> are scheduled after the last year of the Bush presidency. It is unclear how the space vision will be reconciled with budgetary concerns in the longer term.|$|E
25|$|By September 2002, {{the company}} had grown to 15 {{employees}} and had {{a board of directors}} heavy on those with Intel ties, such as Andy Bryant. The company’s original production was a subscription-based email add-on that allowed physicians to securely communicate with patients and others and data protected by HIPAA. In July 2003, the company purchased software company RosettaMed, with plans to incorporate their software into Kryptiq’s <b>existing</b> <b>programs.</b> In August of that year, Kryptiq finished raising $7.9 million in venture capital from investors such as Voyager Capital and SmartForest Ventures. The company continued with acquisitions in November when it purchased MedShape LLC, allowing Kryptiq to expand into the medical records field. Kryptiq retained all six employees who had developed DocuTrak and RosettaStone. By December 2003 {{the company had}} grown to 50 employees and projected to be cash flow positive by the end of 2004.|$|E
500|$|On March 3, 2014, as Chairman of the Budget Committee of the House of Representatives, Ryan {{released}} a report titled , asserting that some of 92 federal programs designed to help lower-income Americans have not provided the relief intended {{and that there is}} little evidence that these efforts have been successful. In the report, Ryan advances the argument that federal antipoverty programs suffer from defects that [...] "penalize families for getting ahead" [...] and that [...] "the complex web of federal programs and sudden drop-off in benefits create extraordinarily high effective marginal tax rates," [...] both of which [...] "reduce the incentive to work". At the core of the report are recommendations to enact cuts to welfare, child care, college Pell grants and several other federal assistance programs. In an appendix titled [...] "Measures of Poverty", when the poverty rate is measured by including non-cash assistance from food stamps, housing aid and other federal programs, the report states that these measurements [...] " [...] implications for both conservatives and liberals. For conservatives, this suggests that federal programs have actually decreased poverty. For liberals, it lessens the supposed need to expand <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> or to create new ones." [...] According to an article in the Fiscal Times, several economists and social scientists whose work had been referenced in the report said that Ryan either misunderstood or misrepresented their research.|$|E

2500|$|Attack trees can lend {{themselves}} to defining an information assurance strategy. [...] It is important to consider, however, that implementing policy to execute this strategy changes the attack tree. [...] For example, computer viruses may be protected against by refusing the system administrator access to directly modify <b>existing</b> <b>programs</b> and program folders, instead requiring a package manager be used. [...] This adds to the attack tree the possibility of design flaws or exploits in the package manager.|$|E
2500|$|On July 11, 2007, Bachmann {{voted against}} the College Cost Reduction and Access Act that would raise the maximum Pell grant from $4,310 to $5,200, lower {{interest}} rates on subsidized student loans to 3.4 percent from 6.8 percent, raise loan limits to $30,500 from $7,500, disfavor married students who file joint tax returns, provide more favorable repayment terms to students who fail to use their education to prosper financially and favor public sector over private sector workers with much more favorable loan forgiveness benefits. Supporters of the bill said [...] "it would allow more students to attend college". Bachmann said her opposition was because [...] "it fails students and taxpayers with gimmicks, hidden costs and poorly targeted aid. It contains no serious reform of <b>existing</b> <b>programs,</b> and it favors the costly, government-run direct lending program over nonprofit and commercial lenders." [...] The bill passed the House and was signed by President Bush.|$|E
