40|$|Background: The risk of renal {{damage in}} {{patients}} with <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption is controversial. The objective of this meta-analysis was to evaluate the associations between <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption and progression of kidney damage including chronic kidney disease (CKD), end-stage renal dis-ease (ESRD) and proteinuria. Methods: A literature search was performed using MEDLINE, EMBASE and Cochrane Databases from inception through August 2014 to identify studies investigating the association between <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption and CKD, ESRD or proteinuria. Studies that reported odds ratios, relative risks or hazard ratios comparing the risk of CKD, ESRD or proteinuria in patients consuming <b>high</b> amount of <b>alcohol</b> versus {{those who did not}} consume alcohol were included. Pooled risk ratios (RRs) and 95 % confidence interval (CI) were calculated using a random-effect, generic inverse variance method. Results: Twenty studies with 292431 patients were included in our analysis to assess the associations be-tween <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption and progression of kidney damage.

25|$|In 2012 {{researchers}} {{developed a}} method for storing electrical energy as chemical energy in <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> (including butanol). These alcohols can then be used as liquid transportation fuels. The team led by James C. Liao genetically engineered lithoautotrophic microorganism known as Ralstonia Eutropha H16 to produce isobutanol and 3-methyl-1-butanol in an electro-bioreactor. Carbon dioxide is the sole carbon source for this process and electricity is used as the energetic component. The process they developed effectively separates the light and dark reactions that occur during photosynthesis. Solar panels are used to convert sunlight to electrical energy which is then converted using the microorganism to a chemical intermediate. The team {{is now in the}} process of scaling up the operation and believes this process will be more efficient than the biologic process.|$|E
25|$|Chemically, transesterified {{biodiesel}} comprises {{a mix of}} mono-alkyl esters of long chain fatty acids. The {{most common}} form uses methanol (converted to sodium methoxide) to produce methyl esters (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Methyl Ester – FAME) {{as it is the}} cheapest alcohol available, though ethanol can be used to produce an ethyl ester (commonly referred to as Fatty Acid Ethyl Ester – FAEE) biodiesel and <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> such as isopropanol and butanol have also been used. Using alcohols of higher molecular weights improves the cold flow properties of the resulting ester, at the cost of a less efficient transesterification reaction. A lipid transesterification production process is used to convert the base oil to the desired esters. Any free fatty acids (FFAs) in the base oil are either converted to soap and removed from the process, or they are esterified (yielding more biodiesel) using an acidic catalyst. After this processing, unlike straight vegetable oil, biodiesel has combustion properties very similar to those of petroleum diesel, and can replace it in most current uses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Aims: To {{study the}} impact of social participation, trust, and the {{miniaturization}} of community, i. e. high social participa-tion/low trust, on the risk of <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption. Methods: The Scania 2000 public health survey is a cross-sectional, postal ques-tionnaire study. A total of 13 604 persons aged 18 – 80 years were included. A logistic regression model was used to investigate the association between the social capital variables and <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption (168. 0 g/week or more for men and 108. 0 g/week or more for women). The multivariate analyses analysed the importance of confounders (age, country of origin, education, and economic stress) on the risk of <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption according to the social capital variables. Results: A 14. 0 % proportion of all men and 7. 8 % of all women had an alcohol consumption above recommended levels. <b>High</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption above recommended levels {{was not associated with}} social participation but negatively associated with trust among men. The miniaturization of community cat-egory, i. e. high social participation/low trust, had significantly higher risks of <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption compared to the high social capital (high social participation/high trust) category among men. Conclusion: High social participation combined with low trust, i. e. the miniaturization of community, is positively associated <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption among men.

5000|$|Mixed Alcohols (i.e., {{mixture of}} mostly ethanol, propanol, and butanol, with some pentanol, hexanol, heptanol, and octanol). Mixed {{alcohols}} are produced from syngas with several classes of catalysts. Some have employed catalysts {{similar to those}} used for methanol. Molybdenum sulfide catalysts were discovered at Dow Chemical and have received considerable attention. [...] Addition of cobalt sulfide to the catalyst formulation was shown to enhance performance. [...] Molybdenum sulfide catalysts have been well studied but have yet to find widespread use. These catalysts have been a focus of efforts at the U.S. Department of Energy's Biomass Program in the Thermochemical Platform. [...] Noble metal catalysts have also been shown to produce mixed alcohols. [...] Most R&D in this area is concentrated in producing mostly ethanol. However, some fuels are marketed as mixed alcohols (see Ecalene and E4 Envirolene) [...] Mixed alcohols are superior to pure methanol or ethanol, in that the <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> have higher energy content. Also, when blending, the <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> increase compatibility of gasoline and ethanol, which increases water tolerance and decreases evaporative emissions. In addition, <b>higher</b> <b>alcohols</b> have also lower heat of vaporization than ethanol, which is important for cold starts.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{involved in}} alcohol use disorders are complex. It {{has been shown}} that ghrelin is an important signal for the control of body weight homeostasis, preferably by interacting with hypothalamic circuits, as well as for drug reward by activating the mesolimbic dopamine system. The ghrelin receptor (GHS-R 1 A) {{has been shown to be}} required for alcohol-induced reward. Additionally, ghrelin increases and GHR-R 1 A antagonists reduce moderate alcohol consumption in mice, and a single nucleotide polymorphism in the GHS-R 1 A gene has been associated with <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption in humans. However, the role of central ghrelin signaling in <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption is not known. Therefore, the role of GHS-R 1 A in operant self-administration of alcohol in rats as well as for <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> consumption in Long-Evans rats and in alcohol preferring [Alko alcohol (AA) ] rats was studied here. In the present study, the GHS-R 1 A antagonist, JMV 2959, was found to reduce the operant self-administration of alcohol in rats and to decrease <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> intake in Long-Evans rats as well as in AA rats. These results suggest that the ghrelin receptor signaling system, specifically GHS-R 1 A, is required for operant self-administration of <b>alcohol</b> and for <b>high</b> <b>alcohol</b> intake in rats. Therefore, the GHS-R 1 A may be a therapeutic target for treatment of addictive behaviors, such as alcohol dependence...|$|R
