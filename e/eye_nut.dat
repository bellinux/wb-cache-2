50|$|It is {{a static}} {{restraint}} i.e. {{it is designed}} to withstand tensile load only (no compression load should be exerted on it, in such case buckling may take place). It is rigid vertical type support provide from top only. It consists of clamp, <b>eye</b> <b>nut,</b> tie rod, beam attachment. Selection of rod hanger depends on pipe size, load, temperature, insulation, assembly length etc. As it comes with hinge and clamp, no substantial frictional force comes into play.|$|E

50|$|The coconut {{has spread}} {{across much of}} the tropics, {{probably}} aided in many cases by seafaring people. Coconut fruit in the wild are light, buoyant, and highly water resistant. It is claimed that they evolved to disperse significant distances via marine currents. However, it can also be argued that the placement of the vulnerable <b>eye</b> of the <b>nut</b> (down when floating), and the site of the coir 'cushion' are better positioned to ensure that the water-filled nut doesn't fracture when dropping on rocky ground, rather than for flotation.|$|R
60|$|On this merry Christmas evening, however, no fears or dim foreshadowings of any coming event clouded {{our hearts}} or faces. Cecily looked {{brighter}} and prettier than I {{had ever seen}} her, with her softly shining <b>eyes</b> and the <b>nut</b> brown gloss of her hair. Felicity was too beautiful for words; and even the Story Girl, between excitement and the crimson silk array, blossomed out with a charm and allurement more potent than any regular loveliness--and this {{in spite of the}} fact that Aunt Olivia had tabooed the red satin slippers and mercilessly decreed that stout shoes should be worn.|$|R

40|$|Fungal corneal ulcers mostly occur after {{incidental}} corneal trauma by plant {{leaves in}} farm lands {{or the use}} of topical corticosteroids or antibiotics. The infection is more prevalent among farmers and harvesters and {{in some parts of the}} world is considered as an occupational disease; however, there have been a few reports on the occurrence of such ulcers in healthy individuals after incidental spillage of vegetative material into the eye. The importance of these ulcers is their long-term and refractory course, which makes the visual prognosis unfavorable in most patients, even after appropriate antifungal therapy or ocular interventions. Herein, we present two rare cases of fungal ulcers caused by incidental spillage of vegetative material into the <b>eye</b> while eating <b>nuts</b> and corn. We also discuss the diagnostic and therapeutic approaches, as well as visual outcome reviewing the relevant literature...|$|R
