For instance, in the 24-hour rainfall distributions as developed by the Soil Conservation Service (now the NRCS or National Resources Conservation Service), rainfall intensity progressively increases until it reaches a maximum and then gradually decreases. Where this maximum occurs and how fast the maximum is reached is what differentiates one distribution from another. One important aspect to understand is that the distributions are for design storms, not necessarily actual storms. In other words, a real storm may not behave in this same fashion.

The event properties are rain event depth, event duration, mean event intensity, peak intensity and the time span between two consecutive rain events which {{is referred to as}} inter-event time (IET). Dimensionless event <b>hyetographs</b> are established by relating fractions of event intensities to the corresponding fractions of event durations.

The rainfall data was recorded at eight stations. The results reveal that rain event depth is more related to peak intensity than to event duration. At the start and towards the end of the wet season, the rain events have larger depth with longer duration and longer IET than the rain events in the mid-season.

50|$|A runoff {{model is}} a {{mathematical}} model describing the rainfall - runoff relations of a rainfall catchment area, drainage basin or watershed. More precisely, it produces a surface runoff hydrograph {{in response to a}} rainfall event, represented by and input as a <b>hyetograph.</b> In other words, the model calculates the conversion of rainfall into runoff.A well known runoff model is the linear reservoir, but in practice it has limited applicability.The runoff model with a non-linear reservoir is more universally applicable, but still it holds only for catchments whose surface area is limited by the condition that the rainfall can be considered more or less uniformly distributed over the area. The maximum size of the watershed then depends on the rainfall characteristics of the region. When the study area is too large, it can be divided into sub-catchments and the various runoff hydrographs may be combined using flood routing techniques.Rainfall-runoff models need to be calibrated before they can be used.|$|E
40|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{emphasized}} the effects of rainfall movement on runoff simulation; nevertheless, {{due to the lack of}} rain gauges inside sub-basins, a method using a <b>hyetograph</b> of the nearest gauges to a sub-basin is usually employed.

Simulations were carried out under two conditions: (1)  stationary conditions where the nearest gauge <b>hyetograph</b> was used and rainfall movement was ignored, which is quite common in the case of a lack of data, and (2)  moving conditions where a shifted <b>hyetograph</b> based on <b>hyetograph</b> timing recorded in the basin was used. The simulation results were compared with the measured discharge at the outlets.

40|$|Hydrologic {{engineering}} {{designs and}} analyses often require the specification of design storm which involves rainfall amount, duration and <b>hyetograph.</b> In practice, {{the determination of}} design rainfall in hydrologic engineering applications involves the frequency analysis of extreme rainfalls of different durations {{and the establishment of}} rainfall <b>hyetograph</b> for the design event under consideration. Sampling errors exist in the estimation of rainfall depth (or intensity) quantiles from frequency analysis, which will be transmitted in the process of determining the design rainfall <b>hyetograph.</b> This paper presents a practical methodological framework based on the bootstrap resampling scheme to assess the uncertainty features associated with the magnitude of estimated rainfall depth/intensity quantiles and the corresponding design hyetographs. The procedure is implemented to quantify uncertainty of design rainfall <b>hyetograph</b> following the Stormwater Drainage Manual of Hong Kong involving the use of rainfall intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) model. Of particular interesting is that the bootstrap resampling scheme implemented herein is modified to handle unequal record period of annual maximum rainfall data series of different durations and to account for their intrinsic correlations. According to the adopted rainfall IDF model, the design rainfall <b>hyetograph</b> {{is a function of the}} IDF model coefficients.

40|$|To {{understand}} {{the characteristics of}} severe floods under global climate change, we created a design <b>hyetograph</b> for a 100 -year return period. This incorporates a modified ranking method using the top 10 extreme rainfall events for present, near-future, and far-future periods. The rainfall data sets were projected with a general circulation model with high spatial and temporal resolution and used with a flood model to simulate the higher discharge peaks for the top 10 events of each term in a local watershed. The conventional-like ranking method, in which only a dimensionless shape is considered {{for the creation of}} a design <b>hyetograph</b> for a temporal distribution of rainfall, likely results in overestimates of discharge peaks because, even with a lower peak of rainfall intensity and a smaller amount of cumulative rainfall, the distribution shape is the only the factor for the design <b>hyetograph.</b> However, the modified ranking method, which considers amounts of cumulative rainfalls, provides a discharge peak from the design <b>hyetograph</b> less affected by a smaller cumulative rainfall depth for extreme rainfall. Furthermore, the effects of global climate change indicate that future discharge peaks will increase by up to three times of those of Present-term peaks, which may result in difficult flood control for the downstream river reaches...|$|E
40|$|The {{main purpose}} of a {{detention}} basin is to temporarily store runoff and to reduce peak discharge in the downstream conveyance system so that its capacity is not exceeded. The determination of required detention storage is based on volume calculations derived from the inflow hydrograph, along with the maximum outlet flow. In this work, utilizing a design storm approach, a yetograph with a variable intensity is proposed to maximize the volume of detention basins. The reliability of the yetograph in assessing a design volume which does not excessively overestimate the real ones is shown. The <b>hyetograph</b> is obtained deriving the depth-duration-frequency (DDF) curve, {{with respect to the}} duration, and drawing the resulting function so that the intensity increases with the duration. Since the starting <b>hyetograph</b> has an infinite duration, first a specific duration is chosen and then a constant intensity, corresponding to the selected duration, is assumed for the whole preceding period. The reliability assessment of the proposed <b>hyetograph</b> is shown by schematizing the rainfall-runoff process within the catchment by means of Nash’s model while the detention basin behavior is simulated by a linear reservoir model. The proposed <b>hyetograph</b> can be even coupled with more sophisticated models of detention basins...|$|E

40|$|Recently, the {{new concept}} of using {{continuous}} simulation in hydraulic design attracts interest. However, {{the absence of}} long rainfall records with appropriate temporal resolution, coupled with the requirement of simulating {{a vast number of}} synthetic events to calculate the flood peak for a given exceedance probability have become a barrier to the use of such approaches. Therefore, the use of design storms based on local intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves remains at present the most popular method not only for its simplicity but mainly because most frequently the IDF curves represent the only available information on local rainfall. Also, IDF based approaches assure the reproduction of rainfall extremes whereas continuous simulation models may fail to do so. An intermediate method lying in between the traditional design storm approach and the continuous simulation approach is presented. The method is based on, and uses as the only input, the IDF curves of a particular catchment. The main concept is to keep the design storm approach for the determination of the total characteristics of the design storm event, extracted from the IDF curves, and use a disaggregation technique to generate an ensemble of alternative <b>hyetographs.</b> The stochastically generated <b>hyetographs</b> are then entered into a rainfall - runoff model and then routed through the hydrosystem in order to simulate its hydraulic performance.

Program HEC-HMS 3. 2 has been used and with this program the model for watersheed of river Glinščica has been created. Glinščica is small river and because of that there is lack of measures and data so it has to be used only methods for which there was enough data.

The impact of climate change on summer and fall flooding on the Châteauguay River Basin (2500 km 2), located {{at the southern end}} of the Quebec province (Canada), was investigated using results from the Canadian GCM (CGCM 1) and a coupled hydrology–hydraulics model of the basin. Three 20 -year periods, corresponding to 1975 – 1995, 2020 – 2040 and 2080 – 2100, were used for the analysis. For each period, 24 -h precipitation depths corresponding to the 20 and 100 -year return periods were determined from a frequency analysis of the summer–fall maximum 24 -h precipitations using a general extreme value frequency distribution. 24 -h rainfall <b>hyetographs</b> were generated using region-specific cumulative distributions provided by the Canadian Atmospheric Environment Service. These <b>hyetographs</b> were then used as inputs to the hydrology–hydraulics model to simulate hydrographs, maximum discharge and maximum water levels at two sections of the river. Results indicate potentially very serious increases in the volume of runoff, maximum discharge and water level with future climate change scenarios. The changes get more drastic as longer return periods are considered. Increases of up to 250 % of the maximum water discharge are encountered and water levels are significantly higher than the current flood levels. If realistic, these scenarios indicate that important decisions will have to be taken to alleviate future increases in flooding damages in what is already a flood prone river.

40|$|Two {{stochastic}} {{models of}} the rainfall process, belonging to different categories, are compared {{in terms of how}} well they reproduce certain <b>hyetograph</b> characteristics. The first is the scaling model of storm <b>hyetograph,</b> which belongs to the category of storm-based models. The second is the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model, the most widespread among the category of point process models. The scaling model is further developed introducing one more parameter to better-fit historical data. The Bartlett-Lewis model is theoretically studied to extract mathematical relationships for the intra-storm structure. The inter-comparison is based on the storm hyetographs of a data set from Greece and another one from USA. The different storms are identified in each data set and classified according to their duration. Both models are fitted using the characteristics of storms. The comparison shows that the scaling model of storm <b>hyetograph</b> agrees well with the structure of historical hyetographs whereas the Bartlett-Lewis rectangular pulse model exhibits some discrepancies in either its original version or its random parameter version. However, it is shown that the performance of the Bartlett-Lewis model is significantly improved, and becomes comparable to that of the scaling model, by introducing a power-law dependence of its cell related parameters (duration and rate of arrivals) on the storm duration. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.

Storms of summer are short and violent and can be the origin of important floods. Due to the strong rainfall variability, precipitation and hydrological regime are very irregular.
