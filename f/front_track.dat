40|$|We propose {{and prove}} {{convergence}} of a <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> method for scalar conservation laws with source term.

Since we want to treat the resonant regime, classical arguments for bounding the total variation of numerical solutions do not apply here. Instead compactness of a sequence of <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> solutions is achieved using a variant of the singular mapping technique invented by Temple [69]. The <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> method has no CFL-condition associated with it, and it does not discriminate between stiff and non-stiff source terms.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{a model of}} continuous sedimentation. Under idealizing assumptions, the settling of the solid particles {{under the influence of}} gravity can be described by the initial value problem for a nonlinear hyperbolic partial differential equation with a flux function that depends discontinuously on height. The purpose of this contribution is to present and demonstrate two numerical methods for simulating continuous sedimentation: a <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> method and a finite finite difference method. The basic building blocks in the <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> method are the solutions of a finite number of certain Riemann problems and a procedure for tracking local collisions of shocks. The solutions of the Riemann problems are recalled herein and the <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm is described. As an alternative to the <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> method, a simple scalar finite difference algorithm is proposed. This method is based on discretizing the spatially varying flux parameters on a mesh that is staggered with respect to that of the conserved variable, resulting in a straightforward generalization of the well-known Engquist-Osher upwind finite difference method. The result is an easily implemented upwind shock capturing method. Numerical examples demonstrate that the <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> and finite difference methods can be used as efficient and accurate simulation tools for continuous sedimentation. The numerical results for the finite difference method indicate that discontinuities in the local solids concentration are resolved sharply and agree with those produced by the <b>front</b> <b>tracking</b> method. The latter is free of numerical dissipation, which leads to sharply resolved concentration discontinuities, but is more complicated to implement than the former.

2500|$|Development of new Fordson/Ford {{tractors}} in the U.S. remained mostly inactive {{for about}} 10 {{years after the}} end of U.S. production, although Ford did experiment with a number of designs during the 1930s. Most of them never left the drawing board, which was intentional; Henry Ford was interested in continuing R (and continued paying Ford engineers to work on it), although he wasn't going to put any models into production until all conditions (design, market) were right for commercial success. A Fordson row-crop model, essentially a [...] "Fordson version of the Farmall" [...] with tricycle design and high clearance, was prototyped at Dearborn in 1930-1931 but waited until 1936 to be produced, when Ford Ltd of Britain produced it as the Fordson All-Around. (It was not without precedent, for the aftermarket had presaged it, although not with the high clearance; in 1939, Ford filed a patent for raising and lowering the clearance on the fly.) The idea of variable <b>front</b> <b>track</b> for row-crop tractors was also considered at Ford during this era. Achieving it via pivoting cantilevered wheel mounts was one of the options, although Ford never put that method into production (it later reached production in the form of the Avery Ro-Trak in 1938). The thought devoted to the topic paid off later, when the Ford 9N achieved it with another, simpler method. Between 1928 and 1932, Henry Ford's attention became consumed mostly by the development and introduction of his company's first V8 engine, which was introduced by Ford on March 31, 1932 and was an immediate success in Ford cars and trucks.
