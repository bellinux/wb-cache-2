25|$|As {{the player}} explores, it becomes {{apparent}} {{the area is}} haunted by {{the spirits of the}} people who vanished in 1947, amongst others (including a Roundhead soldier who died in the original inn during the English Civil War, Timothy, Polly, Nigel and Pete). The player learns George Crabtree, the owner of the hotel in 1947, was suspected of murdering the others and then fleeing. However, Crabtree had learned of an evil in the hotel and was planning to imprison it by using twelve symbols to recite an incantation. Each symbol was on a piece of vellum, which he distributed amongst the staff and guests, most of whom thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b>|$|E
500|$|Hunter {{reports that}} Samuel Johnson visited Smart during the latter's confinement, {{and it was}} Johnson that, [...] "on the first {{approaches}} of Mr Smart's malady, wrote several papers for a periodical publication in which that gentleman was concerned." [...] However, {{at no time did}} Smart ever believe himself to be insane; these meetings began before Smart was ever put into asylum because he still contributed, although not as significantly, to the Universal Visiter. In joking about writing for the Universal Visiter, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer." ...|$|E
500|$|Michel nearly {{decided to}} give up cooking to become an opera singer, but instead {{followed}} Albert to London, despite {{not being able to}} speak English. He would later recall that people thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad</b> for travelling to England {{in view of the fact}} that he considered the state of English cooking at the time was horrific. [...] In 1967 they opened their first restaurant, Le Gavroche at Lower Sloane Street in London. The opening party was attended by celebrities such as Charlie Chaplin and Ava Gardner. For the following week, Chaplin was reportedly shuttled across London so he could eat there. In 1972 the Roux brothers opened a second restaurant, the Waterside Inn, in Bray, Berkshire, and launched a catering business. In 1974, when Michelin stars were first awarded in the UK, Le Gavroche and the Waterside Inn were both amongst those restaurants to win a star, and when a number of restaurants won two Michelin stars for the first time in 1977, both Roux restaurants were among them. Le Gavroche would move to a new location in Mayfair in 1982, and in the same year became the first restaurant in the UK to be awarded three Michelin stars. The same rating for the Waterside Inn would follow in 1985, but Le Gavroche would go back down to two stars in 1993 has not regained the three star level. In 2010, the Waterside Inn became the first restaurant outside France to hold three Michelin stars for a period of 25 years.|$|E

Dr. Evans helps Michael with the case in the [...] "green reality", while Lee insisted that the picture Evans noted is fake. Michael and Hannah speak about Kate in the [...] "red reality", when he finds out that her sister had died earlier. Michael thinks that she must be on the cocaine because of that. He shows Rex what they use to do together, Rex is {{depressed}} and mad, while Rex walks off claiming that he is studying for a Spanish test at school. Later, they go to a man's house who has a video camera at his house. This helps Michael with the case in the [...] "green reality". Vega and Michael continue on the case, and Michael goes to the house. Vega says nothing is there, while Michael thinks to his [...] "green reality", and looks in the bathroom for evidence, which was shaving cream in the cabinet. They speak to Cameron Fuller and Darin Knox, who committed the crime. Evidence was that a drink was dropped on the person who had fallen in the lake. Soon after, Dr. Wild finds evidence from the camera that Kate and her friend had done the crime. She finally confesses to it. They speak in both realities about the story of how it came to the current life. Michael speaks to Rex, again.

Rex goes to the tennis court and apologized to Cole who forgives him.|$|E

2500|$|Contrary to British opinion, King was {{a strong}} believer in the Germany first strategy. However, his natural {{aggression}} did not permit him to leave resources idle in the Atlantic that could be utilized in the Pacific, especially when [...] "it was doubtful when — if ever — the British would consent to a cross-Channel operation". King once complained that the Pacific deserved 30% of Allied resources but was getting only 15%. When, at the Casablanca Conference, he was accused by Field-Marshal Sir Alan Brooke of favoring the Pacific war, the argument became heated. The combative General Joseph Stilwell wrote: [...] "Brooke got nasty, and King got good and sore. King almost climbed over the table at Brooke. God, <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad.</b> I wished he had socked him." ...|$|E
2500|$|Early on, when Johnson {{was unable}} to pay off his debts, he began to work with {{professional}} writers and identified his own situation with theirs. During this time, Johnson witnessed Christopher Smart's decline into [...] "penury and the madhouse", and feared that he might share the same fate. In joking about Christopher Smart's madness, his writing for the Universal Visiter, and his own contributions, Johnson claimed: [...] "for poor Smart, while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>mad,</b> not then knowing the terms on which he was engaged to write... I hoped his wits would return to him. Mine returned to me, and I wrote in 'the Universal Visitor' no longer". The truth was that Johnson wrote for the Universal Visiter as an [...] "act of charity" [...] to the ailing Smart.|$|E
