The imaging plate response was characterized in terms of entrance exposure to the plate and the digital signal indicators generated by the system (SAL - Scanning Average Level and lgM - Logarithmic median) for different beam qualities. Several exposures were performed on a mammography unit and the digital signal, expressed as SAL and lgM for each image was correlated with the entrance exposure on a standard ACR phantom.

We present a centralized, server-based solution for the collection, archival, and distribution of rejected image and <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> data that automates the data collection process. Reject analysis program (RAP) and <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> data were collected and analyzed during a 1 -year period. RAP data were sorted both by reason for repetition and body part examined. Data were also stratified by clinical area for further investigation. The monthly composite reject rate for our institution fluctuated between 8 % and 10 %.

S values were log-normally distributed for examinations performed under either manual or automatic exposure control. The distributions were positively skewed and leptokurtic. S value decreases due to radiologic technology student rotations, and CR plate reader calibrations were observed. Our data demonstrate that reject analysis is still necessary and useful in the era of digital imaging.

METHODS: This was an ecological study using an environmental <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> presented {{as the percentage of}} annual hours (AH%) of PM 2. 5 above 80 &# 956;g/m 3. The outcome variables were the rates of hospitalization due to respiratory disease among children, the elderly and the intermediate age group, and due to childbirth. Data were obtained from the National Space Research Institute and the Ministry of Health for all of the microregions of the Brazilian Amazon region, for the years 2004 and 2005. Multiple regression models for the outcome variables in relation to the predictive variable AH% of PM 2. 5 above 80 &# 956;g/m 3 were analyzed. The Human Development Index (HDI) and mean number of complete blood counts per 100 inhabitants in the Brazilian Amazon region were the control variables in the regression analyses. RESULTS: The association of the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> (AH%) was higher for the elderly than for other age groups (&# 946; = 0. 10). For each 1 % increase in the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> there was an increase of 8 % in child hospitalization, 10 % in hospitalization of the elderly, and 5 % for the intermediate age group, even after controlling for HDI and mean number of complete blood counts.

40|$|The Emilia-Romagna {{coastline}} {{is located}} in northern Italy, facing the Adriatic sea. The area is especially exposed to the flooding hazard because of its low lying nature, high urbanisation and the large exploitation of beach resources for tourism. The identification of hotspots where marine flooding can cause significant damages is, therefore, a key issue. The methodology implemented to identify hotspots {{is based on the}} Coastal Risk Assessment Framework tool that was developed in the RISC-KIT project (www. risckit. eu). The tool combines the hazard component with different <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> and is applied along predefined coastal sectors of almost 1 Km alongshore length. The coastline was divided into 106 sectors in which each component was analysed. The hazard part was evaluated through the computation of maximum water levels, obtained as the sum of wave set-up, storm surge and tide, calculated along representative beach profiles, one per sector, and for two return periods (10 and 100 years). The data for the computation of the maximum water level were extracted from the literature. The landward extension of floodprone areas in each sector was the extension of the flood maps produced by the regional authorities for the EU Flood Directive and for the same return periods. The <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> were evaluated taking into account the location and type of different assets in each sector and in flood-prone areas. Specifically, the assets that were taken into account are: the transport network, the utilities (water, gas and electricity) networks, the land use typologies, the social vulnerability status of the population and the business sector. Each component was then ranked from 1 to 5, considering a scale based on their computed value (hazard), importance and location (<b>exposure</b> <b>indicators).</b> A final coastal index (CI) was computed as the root mean square of the geometrical mean of the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> multiplied by the hazard indicator. Land use typologies were valued taking into account a classification produced by the regional authorities for the Flood Directive. The social vulnerability status of the population was derived from data produced by the National Statistic Institute. The regional managers provided the location of transport and utilities networks. The business indicator was built considering the tourist arrivals in each coastal municipality compared to the total number of arrivals. The results showed that the coast is very exposed to flooding and that the 100 year return period event leads to the identification {{of a large number of}} hotspots (65 over 106) defined as sectors with CI > 2. 5. The main drivers for the hotspot identification were the hazard indicator and the land use typologies, because important transport/utilities network are not located in flood-prone areas.

In both cases, the practice of ETTR does not use or depend on the camera's meter.

A direct {{association}} between {{exposure to the}} metalloid sele-nium and risk of cutaneous melanoma has been suggested by some observational and experimental cohort studies, whereas other studies have yielded inconsistent re-sults. Since some of the inconsistencies {{may be due to}} exposure misclassification arising from the use of <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> that do not adequately reflect body tissue selenium content or the levels of the biologically relevant species of this metalloid, we examined this issue using multiple <b>indicators</b> of <b>exposure.</b> Methods. We analyzed the relation of selenium exposure with risk of cutaneous melanoma using two different biomarkers, plasma and toenail selenium concentra-tion, and estimated dietary selenium intake in a community-based case-control se-ries (54 cases, 56 controls) from an Italian community. Results. In unmatched and matched logistic regression models as well as nonpara-metric generalized additive models, higher plasma selenium levels were strongly as-sociated with excess disease risk. In contrast, toenail and dietary selenium exhibited little relation with melanoma risk. The pattern of correlation among indicators of ex-posure differed by disease status, with dietary intake associated with plasma seleni-um levels in patients but not in controls. Conclusions. Our data showed that different selenium <b>exposure</b> <b>indicators</b> can yield different inferences about melanoma risk.

Concentrations of TOL-EXH, TOL-U and TOL-B are closely correlated with each other. Therefore, HA-U or CR-U and any one of TOL-EXH, TOL-U and TOL-B are appropriate for use as the variable in MRA.

For each country, annual data of the best available <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> and of the number of fatalities were simultaneously analysed with the bivariate latent risk time series model. This model {{is based on the assumption}} that the amount of exposure and the number of fatalities are intrinsically related. It captures the dynamic evolution in the fatalities as the product of the dynamic evolution in two latent trends: the trend in the fatality risk and the trend in the exposure to that risk. Before applying the latent risk model to the different countries it was first investigated and tested whether the <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator</b> at hand and the fatalities in each country were in fact related at all. If they were, the latent risk model was applied to that country; if not, a univariate local linear trend model was applied to the fatalities series only, unless the latent risk time series model was found to yield better forecasts than the univariate local linear trend model. In either case, the temporal structure of the unobserved components of the optimal model was established, and structural breaks in the trends related to external events were identified and captured by adding intervention variables to the appropriate components of the model.

Eligible workers were recruited from university units in which exposure to rats and/or mice, occurrence of respiratory and/or skin symptoms, and/or a history of animal bites had been reported. Exposure to endotoxin and rat and mouse allergen was assessed (71 half-day personal samples). 'Symptomatic' was defined by work-related ocular, nasal, respiratory, or skin symptoms. A concentration of specific IgE against rat or mouse (e 87 and e 88) ≥ 0. 35 kU/l defined sensitization.

40|$|We {{proposed}} a general approach {{for assessing the}} robustness of the point and interval estimates of the primary exposure effect in an observational study, when some confounding effects are on unobserved or unmeasured. Here, we assume that a regression model that includes <b>exposure</b> <b>indicator,</b> measured and unmeasured confounders, can fit the true exposure effect. A reduce model that omits the unmeasured confounder could be represented. Under certain conditions, there exists a simple algebraic relationship between the true exposure effect in the full model an observed exposure effect in the reduce model. Poisson regression and Cox regression models are considered here. Applications to two major medical studies are also described. Key words: cohort studies, covariate adjustment, Cox regression, mixture distribution, poisson regression, and retrospective studie...|$|R
