In July 1888, George Westinghouse licensed Nikola Tesla's American patents for the induction motor and transformer designs. Westinghouse also purchased an American patent option on a possible prior design for an induction motor from the Italian physicist and electrical engineer Galileo Ferraris. He wanted to avoid the rather substantial amount of money being asked to secure the Tesla license, but Westinghouse concluded that it was too risky not to obtain what may have been an earlier patent by Tesla.

But there are obvious defects in reactive power metering in the presence of harmonics mainly due to mistake in phase shifting. This paper analyzes the phase-shift errors of common used varhour meters through sequence component analysis. The frequency response tests and harmonic reactive power tests are done to <b>induction</b> varhour <b>meter</b> and solid-state meter. The test data are analyzed by least square method. The analysis show that the error contribution of varhour meter’s registration in the presence of harmonics are due to amplitude effects and phase effects through analysis of theory and experiments: the phase contribution will be large to both <b>induction</b> varhour <b>meter</b> and solid-state meter and may cause metering errors of double harmonic apparent power, the amplitude is decreased with increasing harmonic order and that of the induction varhour is decreased more dramatically.

5000|$|Electric {{energy meters}} {{that meet the}} {{requirement}} of N-1 elements for an N wire service are often said to be Blondel Compliant. This label identifies the meter as one that will measure correctly under all conditions when correctly installed. However, a meter doesn't have to be Blondel compliant {{in order to provide}} suitably accurate measurements and industry practice often includes the use of such non compliant meters. The form 2S meter is extensively used in the metering of residential three wire services, despite being non compliant in such services. This common residential service consists of two 120 volt wires and one neutral wire. A Blondel compliant meter for such a service would need two elements (and a five jaw socket to accept such a meter), but the 2S meter is a single element meter. The 2S meter includes one potential measuring device (a coil or a voltmeter) and two current measuring devices. The current measuring devices provide a measurement equal to one half of the actual current value. The combination of a single potential coil and two so called half coils provides highly accurate metering under most conditions. The meter has been used {{since the early days of}} the electrical industry. The advantages were the lower cost of a single potential coil and the avoidance of interference between two elements driving a single disc in an <b>induction</b> <b>meter.</b> For line to line loads, the meter is Blondel compliant. Such loads are two wire loads and a single element meter suffices. The non compliance of the meter occurs in measuring line to neutral loads. The meter design approximates a two element measurement by combining a half current value with the potential value of the line to line connection. The line to line potential is exactly twice the line to neutral connection if the two line to neutral connections are exactly balanced. Twice the potential times half the current then approximates the actual power value with equality under balanced potential. In the case of line to line loads, two times the half current value times the potential value equals the actual power. Error is introduced if the two line to line potentials are not balanced and if the line to neutral loads are not equally distributed. That error is given by 0.5(V1-V2)(I1-I2) where V1 and I1 are the potential and current connected between one line and neutral and V2 and I2 are those connected between the other line and neutral. [...] Since the industry typically maintains five percent accuracy in potential, the error will be acceptably low if the loads aren't heavily unbalanced.|$|E

However, with the increase of pollution levels in power systems, the meters may be used even in the presence of distorted voltages and/or currents; in such cases, their accuracy may be very different from the nominal conditions, and the various meters may lead to different measurements of energy for the same load conditions.

40|$|In closed conduit water systems, {{being able}} to {{accurately}} measure flow is absolutely essential. For many meter designs, including electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>meters</b> (also known as magnetic flow meters), the greatest accuracy is achieved when the device is calibrated correctly. Optimal meter accuracy often depends on the flow conditions associated with the upstream geometry in the pipe system. Manufacturers typically give standards {{for the length of}} straight pipe required upstream of the meter. These standards vary, however, and do not address every possible configuration that may be installed upstream of the straight pipe requirement. An investigation on the effects of the length of straight pipe between a single 90 ° elbow and the upstream side of magnetic flow meters was completed in this research. Eleven 10 -inch meters were chosen for testing. The procedure included a baseline test with more than forty diameters of straight pipe between the elbow and the meter. The accuracy of the meter was determined over a range of flow velocities typical for operation of this type and size of meter. Further tests were performed with the meter installed only three diameters downstream of the elbow. These tests constitute Phase I. In Phase II, four meters were tested with the upstream pipe length varying from a close-coupled installation to ten diameters of straight pipe between the elbow and the meter to observe variances in accuracy with distance from the elbow. The intent of the research was to show whether manufacturer accuracy specifications are achievable in actual application. It was determined that very few meters meet the manufacturer’s specification for accuracy even when installation requirements were met.

40|$|Salinity is an {{increasing}} problem in irrigated areas which causes important reductions in agricultural production. Distribution of soil salinity and its variability are required to set up measure-observation control in an irrigated area. The conventional methods to determine soil salinity in an irrigated area entail intensive land survey and laboratory analysis. However these take plenty of time and cost much. Instead of these conventional methods, lately, practical and simple techniques have become a current issue in salinity assessment. One of them is to use electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>meter</b> (Geonics-EM 38) that measures apparent soil salinity, ECa. EM 38 is a device {{which is designed to}} measure ECa horizontally and vertically, i. e., to a depth of 0 - 1 m and 0 - 2 m, respectively. In this research, we tried to investigate the effectiveness of EM 38 device in identifying and mapping of soil salinity. The study was conducted in Yemi li Irrigation District (YID), covering an area of 7110 ha. YID is located in the Lower Seyhan Plain {{in the eastern part of}} the Mediterranean region, Adana, Turkey. The majority of farmers in YID use irrigation return flows of poor quality, diverted from main drainage canals. For this reason, the fields in YID are always under the risk of soil salinization. Therefore, soil salinity has to be monitored frequently in a quick and efficient way. Because of these characteristics, YID was chosen and 112 EM 38 readings were done for salinity assessment. Concurrently, soil samples from 20 points, distributed randomly in the field, were taken from 1 m soil profile with 0. 3 m intervals, summing up three totally. Extracts of soil saturation paste were obtained. Composite samples for 0 - 1 m depths were prepared by using extracts of each layer and salinities of composite samples were measured, ECe, to determine average ECe of 0 - 1 m depth. The relationship between ECe and ECa is determined. Then, ECe map was produced and salinity profile distribution was developed for the study area. The results showed that the electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>meter</b> (EM 38) can be used very efficiently to determine soil salinity in areas prone to salinization like in YID. Additionally, spatial and temporal changes in soil salinity can be derived from EM 38 readings, provided that the deterministic association between ECa and ECe is determined...|$|E

This thesis examines the application of electromagnetic induction geophysical techniques and coincident soil sampling to (1) represent the areal extent and magnitude of soil salinity on the agricultural areas of King Island, Tasmania, (2) constitute its major causes; and (3) address mitigation strategies. An automated electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>meter</b> used in the vertical dipolar mode (EM 31 v) was used to capture apparent total soil conductivity data over 15, 420 Ha of the island. A total of 447 soil samples were obtained from sixty-one soil sample holes typically to 350 cm below surface. Ordinary least squares-based regression methods were used to predict average ECe at the soil sample sites using the conductivity data (ECa) assessed by the EM 31 v (R 2 = 0. 76, p-value = 0. 0001). A local, exponential semivariogram kriging model was developed to interpolate average ECe to 350 cm depth across the surveyed area. An analysis of geographic information layers, further terrain modelling, and climatic estimates of salt accessions were used to isolate the geological, geomorphological and climatic determinants of soil ECe on the island. Across the island the major source of salt is from west coast generated sea spray. Down to 350 cm, the highest average soil conductivity (ECe of 8 dS/m and above) were found to occur in soils formed on Proterozoic granite, Proterozoic shale and undifferentiated Quaternary sediments.

The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the response of irrigated sugarcane to sodic and saline conditions, using natural variations in the field. Sixteen sites, in which sodicity and salinity varied within a field, were selected in the Burdekin district (19  30 ’S, 147  20 ’E) of Queensland, Australia. The soils were clay loams to clays, with neutral to alkaline pH. At each site, a 3 -row (4. 5 m) wide strip of cane that cut across variable areas was identified. The strips were between 150 and 600 m long, and cane yield was measured in selected sections, each 20 to 30 m long. Soils were analysed for solution chemistry, exchangeable cations, nutrients, organic C and particle size distribution. Cane yield (fresh weight) varied from 1 to 252 Mg ha- 1. Soil electrical conductivity (EC 1 : 5) and exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), weighted for depth using root mass distribution data, together accounted for 79. 5 % of the variation in yield over all sites. Only 7. 1 % of the variation in yield was accounted for by site-related factors, including crop variety and class (plant crop or ratoons). Sodicity- and salinity-related parameters (EC 1 : 5, electromagnetic <b>induction</b> <b>meter</b> [Geonics EM 38] readings, exchangeable Na content, and ESP) were highly correlated. Over all sites, EC 1 : 5 at 0 - 0. 125 m depth varied from 0. 04 to 0. 77 dS m- 1 (mean 0. 21 dS m- 1) and at 0. 5 - 0. 625 m depth varied from 0. 03 to 1. 50 dS m- 1 (mean 0. 50 dS m- 1). ESP at 0 - 0. 125 m depth varied from 1. 3 to 75. 4 % (mean 13. 4 %) and at 0. 5 - 0. 625 m depth varied from 1. 7 to 78. 7 % (mean 29. 3 %).
