40|$|WOS: 000356313900024 International audienceA {{critical}} {{aspect of}} 1 D single-shot spontaneous Raman scattering (SRS) experiments in turbulent flames {{is the need}} to ensure highly efficient detection associated with fast temporal gating to remove flame emission. Back-illuminated CCD cameras are remarkable for their high quantum efficiency, large dynamic range, good spatial resolution and low readout noise. However, their full-frame architecture makes these detectors difficult to use for SRS measurements in flame and requires the development of a high-speed shutter. The present work proposes a fast <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutter</b> composed of a large aperture Pockels cell placed between two crossed polarizers, providing high-speed gating up to 500 ns. The throughput of the shutter and its spatial homogeneity are measured. The angular tolerance of the Pockels cell is determined and its suitability for 1 D probing is assessed. Spectra acquired in a premixed methane-air flame show the capacity of the shutter to remove flame emission and increase the signal-to-noise ratio for major Raman species...|$|E
40|$|The {{generation}} of single CO 2 laser pulses, having sub-nanosecond {{rise and fall}} time, is described. The duration of these pulses is controlled in the range 0. 83 to 100 ns and their peak power is {{of the order of}} 1 MW. For the {{generation of}} these pulses, a double-discharge TEA CO 2 laser has been used, in conjunction with an <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutter.</b> A telescopic CO 2 laser amplifier has been employed to amplify the nanosecond pulses to 1 GW power levels. The design and operational characteristics of this device are presented and the effective elimination of associated problems is discussed. The effect of organic vapour additives on the performance of this oscillator-amplifier system is investigated. Experimental evidence is presented indicating an increased efficiency in the amplification of multi-line - as opposed to single line - nanosecond pulses. A novel method for single longitudinal mode operation of pulsed TEA CO 2 lasers - incorporating the use of two unstable coupled resonators - has been developed. The powers thereby achieved are in excess of 30 MW. <p...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{isotropic}} {{phase of}} polar liquid crystals exceptionally large electrically-induced optical birefringence coefficients (Kerr effect) are shown to occur.. The static and dynamic Kerr coefficients are correlated with molec-ular functional groups and are {{shown to be}} due to pre-transitional short-range order effects. Two relaxation processes with relaxation times between 10−7 - 10−9 sec are identified to govern the dynamics. The dispersion mechanisms as well as potential applications of liquid crystals in fast <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutters</b> are outlined.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{charge-coupled}} device (CCD) cameras equipped with image intensifiers {{are increasingly being}} used for radiographic applications. These systems {{may be used to}} replace film recording for static imaging, or at other times CCDs coupled with <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutters</b> may be used for static or dynamic (explosive) radiography. Image intensifiers provide precise shuttering and signal gain. The authors have developed a set of performance measures to calibrate systems, compare one system to another, and to predict experimental performance. The performance measures discussed in this paper are concerned with image quality parameters that relate to resolution and signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R
50|$|In {{magneto-optical}} shutters, {{the active}} material of the Faraday cell (e.g. dense flint glass, which reacts well to strong magnetic field) is located inside an electromagnet coil, formed by few loops of thick wire. The coil is powered through a pulse forming network, by a discharge of a high-voltage capacitor (e.g. 2 microfarads at 1000 volts), switched into the coil by a trigatron or a thyratron.In <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutters,</b> the active material is a liquid, typically nitrobenzene, {{located in a}} cell between two electrodes. A brief impulse of high voltage is applied to rotate the polarization of the passing light.|$|R
40|$|An old {{but still}} ongoing subject of debate among {{augmented}} reality (AR) experts is about which see-through paradigm is best in wearable AR displays. Video see-through (VST) and optical see-through (OST) paradigms have both their own strengths and shortcomings {{with respect to}} technological and human-factor aspects. The major difference between these see-through paradigms is in providing an aided (VST) or unaided (OST) view of the real world. In this work, we present a novel approach {{for the development of}} AR stereoscopic head-mounted displays (HMDs) that can provide both the see-through mechanisms. Our idea is to dynamically modify the transparency of the display through a liquid crystal (LC) -based <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutter</b> applied {{on the top of a}} standard OST device opportunely modified for housing a pair of external cameras. A plane-induced homography transformation is used for consistently warping the video images, hence reducing the parallax between cameras and displays. An externally applied drive voltage is used for smoothly controlling the light transmittance of the LC shutters so as to allow an easy transition between the unaided and the camera-mediated view of the real scene. Our tests have proven the efficacy of the proposed solution under worst-case lighting conditions...|$|E
40|$|Herein, we have {{investigated}} the various characteristics of two structurally different phases of Al 2 O 3 nanowires: (i) gamma-Al 2 O 3 (cubic) and (ii) gamma-Al 2 O 3 (monoclinic). These nanowires were synthesized via hydrothermal treatment followed by calcination. The structural and luminescent properties were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy, high-resolution transmission electron microscopy and time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy. A plausible formation mechanism was proposed {{on the basis of}} experimental observations and analysis. These nanowires of both phases exhibit blue emission at similar to 466 nm (2. 65 eV) upon 253 nm UV excitation wavelength. The time-resolved photoluminescence spectroscopy indicated that the decay time (tau) of theta-Al 2 O 3 nanowires (tau = 273 picoseconds) is longer than that of gamma-Al 2 O 3 nanowires (tau = 198 picoseconds). Moreover, these Al 2 O 3 nanowires were dispersed in ferroelectric liquid crystal (FLC) to observe their effect on the electrooptical characteristics. The electro-optical response of the composite devices showed faster electrooptical response, thereby suggesting potential applications in <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutters</b> and modulators. ...|$|R
40|$|Highly {{sensitive}} infrared detectors have to {{be protected}} against the impact of intense infrared radiation, for example from lasers or sun light. Conventional laser safety filters work only in a limited wavelength range, <b>electro-optical</b> <b>shutters</b> reduce the transmission significantly and micro-opto-mechanical systems (MOEMS) show problems with picture quality due to difficulties in aligning precisely all mirrors. As in many applications the IR illumination originates from a local spot in the image field, filters consisting of many segments that can be switched individually from ?transparent? to ?opaque? are therefore desirable. Individual switching requires a sophisticated combination of infrared materials and an optimized geometrical design, to achieve fast switching in combination with negligible crosstalk between neighbouring segments. We have realized fast switchable matrix-addressable infrared filters in the optical range between 2 and 12 ?m based on complex composite devices. Vanadium dioxide (VO 2) {{was used as a}} thermochromic layer, diamond as a heat-conducting layer, and chalcogenide glass as a heat insulating submount. Finite element calculations accompanied by an extensive series of experiments showed, that switching times less than 1 ms can be achieved if all materials are properly designed, prepared and matched together. A first prototype with a 10 x 10 pixel array has been realized at Fraunhofer IAF and successfully tested. The measurements confirmed the numerical simulations and proved the great potential of these devices...|$|R
