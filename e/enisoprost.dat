40|$|The {{actions of}} {{hydrochloric}} acid, natural PGE 1, PGE 2 and a synthetic commercial PGE 1 preparation, <b>Enisoprost</b> (Searle) on pepsinogen synthesis and secretion were studied in canine chief cell monolayer cultures. Hydrochloric acid, applied {{directly to the}} apical surface of chief cells using culture plate inserts (Millipore) {{had no effect on}} secretion, nor did it affect the action of any secretagogue in the basolateral medium. All prostaglandins tested showed significant stimulation of pepsinogen secretion. Basal secretion of pepsinogen after 90 min was 9. 4 (1. 3) % to total initial monolayer content. At 10 (- 6) M, PGE 1 stimulated secretion was 26. 1 (3. 8) %; PGE 2 27. 9 (4) % and <b>Enisoprost</b> 28. 8 (4. 2) % of initial pepsinogen content. Stimulations by all tested prostaglandins were additive with carbachol (10 (- 4) M) and CCK (10 (- 9) M), but not with VIP (10 (- 6) M), dbcAMP (10 (- 3) M) or forskolin (10 (- 6) M) responses. All three prostaglandins stimulated pepsinogen synthesis as measured by 14 C labelled amino acid incorporation into pepsinogen. Time course experiments were similar to those for forskolin and showed shorter time delays between stimulus and increased synthesis rate than carbachol but longer than dbcAMP. Stimulated pepsinogen secretion was inhibited by high pepsin concentrations (greater than 800 micrograms/ml) in the medium. The inhibited abolished simultaneous carbachol induced stimulation of synthesis but prostaglandin or forskolin stimulation only after two hours. Combined with the shorter response time, as compared with carbachol, these data support our previous findings that potent stimulators of cAMP production can stimulate pepsinogen synthesis directly by stimulation of mRNA synthesis, independently from an increased secretion. The additivity of effects with carbachol or CCK and similarity with forskolin stimulated synthesis supports the suggestion that the actions of prostaglandins are mediated by cAMP...|$|E
40|$|Bacterial {{translocation}} {{and related}} mortality rates {{were examined in}} previously transfused BALB/c mice that were gavaged with 14 C radioisotope-labeled Escherichia coli before inflicting a 20 % full-thickness flame burn. Radionuclide counts were measured in blood obtained by retro-orbital puncture 4 hours postburn, and survival was recorded for 10 days. Radionuclide counts in the blood correlated well with both radionuclide counts and numbers of viable bacterial in the tissues. Survivors had significantly less bacterial translocation as evidenced by blood radionuclide counts compared with nonsurvivors, {{and there was a}} significant inverse correlation between the degree of translocation and the length of survival. In the next experiment, the prostaglandin E (PGE) analogs misoprostol, <b>enisoprost,</b> or 16, 16 -dimethyl PGE 2 were administered to transfused animals for 3 days before burn. Prostaglandin E analogs significantly reduced bacterial translocation as measured by blood radionuclide counts 4 hours postburn and improved survival. The data demonstrate that the intensity of bacterial translocation after burn injury is significantly associated with subsequent death. Improvement of survival by PGE analogs is associated with decreased bacterial translocation...|$|E
