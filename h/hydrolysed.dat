5|$|ATP {{is stable}} in aqueous {{solutions}} between pH6.8 and 7.4, {{but it is}} rapidly <b>hydrolysed</b> at more extreme pH's. ATP hydrolyses to ADP and phosphate. Living cells maintain the ratio of ATP to ADP at a point ten orders of magnitude from equilibrium, with ATP concentrations fivefold higher than the concentration of ADP.|$|E
5|$|Serine and {{cysteine}} proteases catalyse {{peptide bond}} cleavage by a two-step process. Initially, the catalytic residue {{of the active}} site triad performs a nucleophilic attack on the peptide bond of the substrate. This releases the new N-terminus and forms a covalent ester-bond between the enzyme and the substrate. This covalent complex between enzyme and substrate is called an acyl-enzyme intermediate. For standard substrates, the ester bond is <b>hydrolysed</b> and the new C-terminus is released to complete catalysis. However, when a serpin is cleaved by a protease, it rapidly undergoes the S to R transition before the acyl-enzyme intermediate is <b>hydrolysed.</b> The efficiency of inhibition depends on fact that the relative kinetic rate of the conformational change is several orders of magnitude faster than hydrolysis by the protease.|$|E

5|$|A {{catalytic}} triad {{refers to}} the three amino acid residues that function together at {{the centre of the}} active site of some hydrolase and transferase enzymes (e.g. proteases, amidases, esterases, acylases, lipases and β-lactamases). An Acid-Base-Nucleophile triad is a common motif for generating a nucleophilic residue for covalent catalysis. The residues form a charge-relay network to polarise and activate the nucleophile, which attacks the substrate, forming a covalent intermediate which is then <b>hydrolysed</b> to regenerate free enzyme and release the product. The nucleophile is most commonly a serine or cysteine amino acid, but occasionally threonine. Because enzymes fold into complex three-dimensional structures, the residues of a catalytic triad can be far from each other along the amino-acid sequence (primary structure), however, they are brought close together in the final fold.|$|E
5|$|Physiological enzyme {{inhibition}} {{can also be}} produced by specific protein inhibitors. This mechanism occurs in the pancreas, which synthesises many digestive precursor enzymes known as zymogens. Many of these are activated by the trypsin protease, so {{it is important to}} inhibit the activity of trypsin in the pancreas to prevent the organ from digesting itself. One way in which the activity of trypsin is controlled is the production of a specific and potent trypsin inhibitor protein in the pancreas. This inhibitor binds tightly to trypsin, preventing the trypsin activity that would otherwise be detrimental to the organ. Although the trypsin inhibitor is a protein, it avoids being <b>hydrolysed</b> as a substrate by the protease by excluding water from trypsin's active site and destabilising the transition state. Other examples of physiological enzyme inhibitor proteins include the barstar inhibitor of the bacterial ribonuclease barnase and the inhibitors of protein phosphatases.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemistry}} of arsenic is predominately nonmetallic. Whether or not arsenic forms a cation is unclear. Its many metal alloys are mostly brittle. It shows fewer tendencies to anionic behaviour than ordinary nonmetals. Its solution chemistry is characterised by {{the formation of}} oxyanions. Arsenic generally forms compounds {{in which it has}} an oxidation state of +3 or +5. The halides, and the oxides and their derivatives are illustrative examples. In the trivalent state, arsenic shows some incipient metallic properties. The halides are <b>hydrolysed</b> by water but these reactions, particularly those of the chloride, are reversible {{with the addition of a}} hydrohalic acid. The oxide is acidic but, as noted below, (weakly) amphoteric. The higher, less stable, pentavalent state has strongly acidic (nonmetallic) properties. Compared to phosphorus, the stronger metallic character of arsenic is indicated by the formation of oxoacid salts such as AsPO4, As2(SO4)3 and arsenic acetate As(CH3COO)3. The oxide As2O3 is polymeric, amphoteric, and a glass former. Arsenic has an extensive organometallic chemistry (see organoarsenic chemistry).|$|E
50|$|The {{two types}} of cholinesterase are {{acetylcholinesterase}} (ACHE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE). The {{difference between the two}} types has to do with their respective preferences for substrates: the former <b>hydrolyses</b> acetylcholine more quickly; the latter <b>hydrolyses</b> butyrylcholine more quickly.|$|R
40|$|The {{kinetics}} of the <b>hydrolyses</b> {{of secondary}} and tertiary N-amidomethylsulfonamides were studied at 50 C. Both types of N-amidomethylsulfonamide <b>hydrolyse</b> through acid- and base-catalysed processes, {{as indicated by}} the pH–rate profiles. The order of reactivity for the acid-catalysed pathway implies a mechanism involving protonation of the amide followed by expulsion of a neutral amide and formation of a sulfonyliminium ion. In the base-catalysed region, compound 5 c, which is substituted at both amide and sulfonamide nitrogen atoms, <b>hydrolyses</b> by nucleophilic attack of hydroxide ion at the amide carbonyl carbon atom to form benzoic acid and a sulfonamide. In contrast, compound 5 b, which contains a sulfonamide NH group, <b>hydrolyses</b> to benzamide and sulfonamide products by an E 1 cbrev mechanism involving ionisation of the sulfonamide. Compound 5 a, which contains an amide NH, also <b>hydrolyses</b> to sulfonamide and amide products, probably by an E 2 mechanism...|$|R

25|$|PON1 {{in humans}} is encoded by the PON1 gene {{which is located}} on the long arm of {{chromosome}} 7. Although many nutritional, life-style and pharmaceutical modulators of PON1 are known., by far the biggest effect on PON1 activity levels, which can vary by over 40 fold between individuals, is through PON1 genetic polymorphisms. The coding region PON1-Q192R polymorphism determines a substrate dependent effect on activity. Some substrates e.g. paraoxon are <b>hydrolysed</b> faster by the R- isoform while others such as diazoxon and lipid-peroxides are <b>hydrolysed</b> more rapidly by the Q- isoform. Both the coding region PON1-L55M and the promoter region PON1-T-108C polymorphisms are associated with different serum concentrations and therefore activities. The 55L allele results in significantly higher PON1 mRNA and serum protein levels and therefore activity compared to the 55M allele. The -108C allele has greater promoter activity than the -108T allele which results in different serum activities.|$|E
25|$|Serine, {{threonine}} and cysteine proteases use a nucleophilic residue (usually in a catalytic triad). That residue {{performs a}} nucleophilic attack to covalently link the protease to the substrate protein, releasing {{the first half}} of the product. This covalent acyl-enzyme intermediate is then <b>hydrolysed</b> by activated water to complete catalysis by releasing the second half of the product and regenerating the free enzyme.|$|E
25|$|The free {{cysteine}} nucleophile forms a {{bond with}} the phosphorus atom of the phosphate moiety, and the P-O bond linking the phosphate group to the tyrosine is protonated, either by a suitably positioned acidic amino acid residue (Asp in the diagram below) or a water molecule. The phospho-cysteine intermediate is then <b>hydrolysed</b> by another water molecule, thus regenerating the active site for another dephosphorylation reaction.|$|E

25|$|ATP is <b>hydrolysed</b> {{relatively}} rapidly {{just after}} {{the addition of a}} G-actin monomer to the filament. There are two hypotheses regarding how this occurs; the stochastic, which suggests that hydrolysis randomly occurs {{in a manner that is}} in some way influenced by the neighbouring molecules; and the vectoral, which suggests that hydrolysis only occurs adjacent to other molecules whose ATP has already been <b>hydrolysed.</b> In either case, the resulting Pi is not released, it remains for some time noncovalently bound to actin’s ADP, in this way there are three species of actin in a filament: ATP-Actin, ADP+Pi-Actin and ADP-Actin. The amount of each one of these species present in a filament depends on its length and state: as elongation commences the filament has an approximately equal amount of actin monomers bound with ATP and ADP+Pi and a small amount of ADP-Actin at the (-) end. As the stationary state is reached the situation reverses, with ADP present along the majority of the filament and only the area nearest the (+) end containing ADP+Pi and with ATP only present at the tip.|$|E

This molecule undergoes a number of further modifications. Intermediates are used in different species to form particular substances, but, in humans, the main end-product protoporphyrin IX is combined with iron to form heme.
