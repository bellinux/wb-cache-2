40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to provide background information on asphaltic concrete mixtures peculiar to northwest Iowa. This background is necessary to provide the basis for future specifications. There were several projects let in 1967 involving l", 3 / 4 " and 3 / 8 " mixes of Type "B'' asphaltic concrete which specified in part, II Not less than 40 % of the material passing the No. 200 sieve shall be pulverized limestone or mineral filler, but in no case shall the per cent of pulverized limestone or mineral filler passing the No. 200 sieve be less than 2 %. No credit will be allowed for limestone in gravel - II Northwest Iowa has no suitable limestone or mineral filler locally available. As a result, this material has to be imported, raising the cost of the mix approximately twenty-five cents per ton. The purpose of this study, therefore, was designed to compare some original job mix samples with alternate mixes from the same local material, but without the addition of pulverized limestone or mineral filler. Since the filler from the crushed gravel does not have the same crushing characteristics or sieve analysis as the pulverized limestone or mineral filler, they could not be compared on an equal percentage basis. Therefore, the alternate mixes were made to conform to the following proposed specification, "No less than 40 % of the material passing No. 200 sieve shall be pulverized limestone or mineral filler or a 100 % crushed gravel, but in no case shall the per cent of pulverized limestone or mineral filler or a 100 % crushed <b>gravel</b> <b>passing</b> the No. 200 sieve be less than 2 %. ...|$|R

2500|$|This {{significant}} loss of suitable spawning {{habitat is}} {{due to lack of}} spawning-sized gravel recruitment from lateral and upstream sources due to the installation of manmade barriers that block this <b>gravel</b> from <b>passing</b> naturally downstream. Without recruitment, high flow releases scour gravel from spawning beds, so that they gradually become smaller and smaller. The smaller pieces of gravel are more easily picked up and moved downstream, leaving behind larger pieces that the salmon are unable to move to bury their eggs in a process called redd construction. This further crowds the salmon into smaller and smaller suitable spawning beds, which increases the likelihood of redd superimposition. This is when spawners construct their redds, or pockets in the gravel to lay their eggs in, on top of preexisting redds, thereby killing or burying some of the eggs in the pre-existing redds. [...] The EPA has also stated that the remaining gravel is [...] "probably fairly highly embedded and therefore of reduced quality and unavailable to fish for spawning". The Temperature of the water can also affect the level of spawning. The best temperatures for spring and fall run Chinook salmon are between 42° F and 57° F. However, in 77% of the years studied by the San Joaquin River Restoration Program, water temperatures were elevated above 57° F and abnormalities and egg morbidity rates increased.|$|R

Clarkson also noted that Hammond's river of <b>gravel</b> would <b>pass</b> through one of Redgrave's flowerbeds, which would be particularly difficult to remove. Hammond demonstrates that it is easy to simply dig up each flower with a trowel, Clarkson declares it would take too long, and instead reveals his unique method for removing the flowers using a shotgun. Unimpressed, Hammond sends Clarkson and May to Wyevale Garden Centre to pick up supplies. Deciding to go ahead with his plans to create a 'river of gravel', Hammond uses a small Caterpillar digger to dig a trench in the garden. Meanwhile, Clarkson and May arrive back with their desired equipment, only to destroy the push bike of one of Redgrave's children as they pull into his drive. As May starts work on his shed, Clarkson enlists the help of the Poles to start work on his greenhouse. Meanwhile, unable to control his digger, Hammond crashes it into the trench, leaving it immobile. In an attempt to rectify the situation, he hires a much larger digger to pull the smaller one out of the hole, but due to the digger being extremely heavy, it results in him leaving numerous caterpillar track marks all over the remainder of the garden lawn.
