In order to understand the operational criteria on how stand classification has been made, we compared structures of species and tree size between <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stand and supplemental planting stand. 19 sample plots established in sub-compartments 108 C and 109 C in 2002 for estimating standing volume of trees were used for the analysis. The key findings derived from this study are as follows: 1) The mean number and growing stock of conifers in <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stand were significantly larger than those in supplemental planting stand. 2) The number of conifers (≥ 5 cm in DBH) were ≥ 150 stems/ha in <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stand, whereas < 150 stems/ha in supplemental planting stand. 3) In all DBH classes, the number of conifers in <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stand was significantly larger than that in supplemental planting stand. Results indicate that the number of conifers may be a major indicator for distinguishing <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stand from supplemental planting stand. The size structure of conifers should be well-balanced to be classified as <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stand...|$|R

30|$|These {{findings}} are {{in accordance with}} studies in other forest types, where <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> maintained these structural forest attributes over decades while providing timber yields at regular intervals (e.g. Pukkala and Gadow 2012; Gronewold et al. 2010; O’Hara et al. 2007; Keeton 2006; Bagnaresi 2002). The observed reverse-J shaped distributions are typical for old-growth stands in the Valdivian Costal Range and the Valdivian Andes (Donoso 2013; Donoso 2005), showing that single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> is able to maintain this old-growth attribute. Still, {{results of this study}} cover only the short-term impacts of <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> (2  years), and there may be lag effects with sensitive species. However, the growth model predictions of Rüger et al. (2007), which were parameterised for the evergreen forest type on Chiloé Island, Chile, suggest that single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> can maintain the above-mentioned forest attributes also on the long term. Moreover, balanced structures with similar crown covers for small-, intermediate- and large-sized trees allow more abundant regeneration and tree growth in the evergreen forest type in Chile than unbalanced ones (Schütz et al. 2012; Donoso and Nyland 2005; Donoso 2005).|$|R

Furthermore, we established 5 × 5 -m plots for evaluating seedling and sapling abundance in four different environments, 1) around new stumps of Q. crispula, 2) closed canopy, 3) south-facing slopes along the forest roads, and 4) north-facing slopes. The former two environments are in forest stands, whereas the latter two are on the forest edge. Then, we counted the number of Q. crispula seedlings (height ＜ 20 cm) and saplings (20 cm ≦ height ＜ 130 cm). This study revealed that no dead trees were detected during the five years after <b>selection</b> <b>cutting.</b> We also found that living trees in selection-cutting forests showed greater growth than those in forests without silvicultural practice. Furthermore, the numbers of seedlings and saplings were significantly higher around new stumps than in those in other environments. In contrast, very few new recruits were detected in forest stands, most of recruits occurred in the south-facing slope in the forest edge.

30|$|Overall, {{our results}} support the claim that single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> is a {{promising}} silvicultural approach for the evergreen forest type. This approach is certainly more promising than the currently supported selective harvesting guidelines of the Chilean law which do not control for a balanced residual stock and allow the harvest of 35 % of the basal area in 5 -year cutting cycles, which is unsustainable (Donoso 2013; Schütz et al. 2012). In contrast, the only negative affect detected for the single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> regime applied {{in the present study}} was the clearly lower number of large-sized and emergent trees in managed plots, a key structural attribute of old-growth forests and crucial for biodiversity conservation.|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} to the control plots, treated plots had around twice as many young trees between 5 and 15  cm dbh (Fig.  2) before and after harvesting. For emergent trees (100  + cm dbh), a clear trend existed, with most trees in this diameter class in the control plots (max. diameter 160  cm) and few in the LRBA plots (max. diameter 105  cm). The LRBA plots had already fewer emergent trees before harvesting (plots had been slightly subjected to “selective” cuts {{in the past as}} mentioned above) but the difference became more pronounced after single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting.</b> Additionally, <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> reduced the number of large trees (50 – 100  cm dbh), especially in the LRBA plots (Fig.  2).|$|R

Highest mortality occurred in the controls in both the even- and uneven-aged stands, primarily due to suppression, while weather was the leading mortality agent in the thinning and <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> treatments. Beetles were the primary killer of ponderosa pine, and western spruce budworm of Douglas-fir. Mortality of trees ≥ 25 cm diameter was negligible in all silvicultural cutting treatments.

40|$|The {{amount of}} <b>selection</b> <b>cuttings</b> in {{uneven-aged}} forest stands {{is supposed to}} increase in Finland with the new Forest Act. In uneven-aged management, {{it is estimated that}} the cutting could be repeated every 15 – 20 years with the removal of around 100 m 3 /ha, depending on the site type and stand growth. This interval and volume highly depend on survival of lower canopy trees in cuttings. The number of these trees (2. 5 – 15 m in height) is typically limited. Felling larger trees from above means a high damage risk for smaller trees and also restricts the harvesting outside the heavy frost period due to top damage risk. Damage to trees taller than 2. 5 meters was studied in three <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> stands. Mechanized harvesting (harvester–forwarder) was carried out in late winter with no frost, which is the optimal time for <b>selection</b> <b>cuttings.</b> On the average 21. 5 % of the remaining trees were damaged. The percentage of damage to smaller (2. 5 – 10 m) trees was highest, 28. 4 %. Stem damage and breakage were the most common types of injury. A logistic mixed model was used to model the probability of tree injury (uninjured/injured). Distance from the nearest removed tree, harvested basal area within 25 m of the tree and diameter of the tree were the explanatory variables taken into the model.

30|$|We {{examined}} {{changes in}} forest structure and tree species composition {{as well as}} possible detrimental effects on key attributes of old-growthness in stands managed through single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting.</b> Through both harvest variants, high and low residual basal areas (HRBA and LRBA), a balanced, uneven-aged structure with reverse-J diameter distribution and forest cover were maintained. Also, a sufficient growing stock of small-sized trees was kept. Moreover, neither tree species richness, diversity and evenness, nor the presence of less frequent species were negatively affected on the short term. As the effects on tree regeneration remain unknown, {{using a combination of}} HRBA and LRBA may be advisable to support good development of relatively fast-growing and valuable mid-tolerant tree species associated with shade-tolerant ones. The only negative effect detected was the clearly lower number of large-sized and emergent trees in managed plots (especially for LRBA), which are a key structural attribute of old-growth forests and crucial for biodiversity conservation. These results suggest that single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting,</b> if adjusted to retain a certain number of large-sized and emergent trees, can serve as a possible means to preserve many old-growth structural and compositional attributes of the evergreen forest type in managed stands while harvesting timber for the landowners.

30|$|These {{considerations}} {{should be}} addressed before a new silvicultural scheme is applied at a large scale to avoid unwanted side effects. In the present work, our aim was, therefore, to evaluate the impacts of single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> with two different residual basal areas, upon structural and compositional attributes of old-growth temperate rainforests of the evergreen forest type. We were interested in finding management approaches that could avoid negative impacts on old-growth attributes and associated biodiversity at the stand scale. The objectives were to: (a) quantify the type and magnitude of structural and compositional changes induced through single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> with high residual basal areas (HRBA; 60  m 2  ha− 1) and low residual basal areas (LRBA; 40  m 2  ha− 1); and (b) identify key structural and compositional attributes of old-growthness that were affected through single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> with HRBA and LRBA. Unmanaged and well-conserved forests of the evergreen forest type in Chile reach 80 – 100  m 2  ha− 1 in basal area and support regeneration of almost exclusively shade-tolerant species (Donoso and Nyland 2005). The rationale for these two levels of residual basal areas was, therefore, that single-tree selection with LRBA would create relatively more light availability and was expected to favour the development of both ecologically and economically important mid-tolerant tree species (Donoso 2013). However, there might be trade-offs in terms of greater structural and compositional changes at LRBA compared with HRBA.|$|R

Results indicated {{that there were no}} significant effects from the slope classes and slope aspects on vegetative parameters before and after single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> in 1994 and 2006 (P> 0. 05). In single-tree <b>selection</b> <b>cutting,</b> the total species volume per hectare in different diameter classes in 1994 (before cutting) was approximately similar to 2006 (after cutting) (P> 0. 05).

Forest harvesting impacts root cohesion, and although the temporal effects have been noted, this dynamic parameter is often assumed to be spatially uniform. A model was developed to simulate the variation in root cohesion on a hillslope resulting from various forest management treatments. The model combines physical data on the horizontal rooting distribution of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco var. menziesii) together with a temporal relation of root cohesion decay.

At this site, inventory-based low-intensity <b>selection</b> <b>cutting</b> was used to maintain a continuous forest canopy.

Tree diameters for all plots showed a roughly inverse J-shaped distribution before cutting and a left-skewed unimodal distribution after two cuttings. Volume ratio (the relative amount of volume contained in different diameter classes) for small (6 - 14 cm), medium (14 - 26 cm), large (26 - 36 cm), and very large (> 38 cm) diameters remained unchanged in the plots with 5 and 10 % basal area removal, but increased in the plots with 15 and 20 % basal area removal, reaching approximately a 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 ratio in the plots with 20 % basal area removal after two <b>selection</b> <b>cuttings.</b> Net carbon storage increased when increasing cutting intensity, reaching maximum storage in the plots with 20 % basal area removal (cutting intensity and net C storage increase: 0 %, 7. 21 Mg C ha- 1, 5 - 10 %: 11. 68 Mg C ha- 1, 15 %: 21. 41 Mg C ha- 1, 20 %: 26. 47 Mg C ha- 1).

This study characterized and compared the composition (saplings and trees) and structure (gaps, foliage distribution, tree diameter and density, snags and coarse woody debris) of old-growth stands (OG), 12 -year-old selection cuts (SC), and 28 - 33 -year-old diameter-limit cuts (DLC) in sugar maple (Acer saccharum) -dominated northern hardwood stands. Results showed marked structural differences between OG and harvested stands, with stronger differences between DLC and OG than between SC and OG. The synchronized formation of numerous canopy openings in harvested stands induced a massive post-harvest recruitment of advance regeneration in both SC and DLC that created a dense foliage layer in the understory. Large living trees (dbh > 39. 1 cm) and defective trees were less numerous in SC than OG, which can have a detrimental impact on species dependent on these structural elements, and on the future availability and characteristics of coarse woody debris. Relatively few compositional differences were noticed among stand types, although a greater proportion of mid-tolerant species was found in the post-harvest recruitment cohorts of harvested stands compared to OG, and a lower proportion of beech (Fagus grandifolia Ehrh.) saplings was observed in DLC compared to OG and SC.
