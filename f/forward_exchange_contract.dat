40|$|Thesis (M. B. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Pietermaritzburg, 2006. Currency {{exposure}} {{has become}} a widespread issue as more corporations of all sizes source and sell in overseas markets and compete {{both at home and}} abroad with international companies. Very few companies are unaffected by currency risk, whether directly or indirectly. Businesses that source products from foreign countries face the risk that exchange rate movement will erode gross margins if competition prevents selling prices from rising in tandem, while resource-based companies face the uncertainty associated with the fact that the world's commodities markets are denominated in US Dollars or Pounds Sterling while their costs are often denominated in their local currencies. Businesses that ignore exchange rate volatility expose themselves to unnecessary risk, which could have significant consequences if exchange rates suddenly move unfavourably. The volatility of the South African Rand over the past few years is forcing treasurers and other managers responsible for international trade to look anew at how South African exchange rate fluctuations affect their company's results. Many companies have suffered from the effects of fluctuating exchange rates; some have reported losses running into millions of Rand. While more and more firms realize that they should manage foreign exchange risk, not all of them have come up with an appropriate management strategy. There has always been a great deal of debate over the best approach to hedging, or the best methods to forecast exchange rates; however hedging is of the utmost importance for companies. With the recent volatility of the rand, the multinational firm covered in this thesis, showed foreign exchange losses amounting to several millions, using forward exchange contracts to cover its high foreign exchange exposures. The major disadvantage of the forward contract as experienced by the firm and shown in this thesis is that it is a legally binding agreement and thus the firm was bound to accept the agreed exchange rate and also the fact that the exchange itself had to be done. If the commercial reason for the exchange disappeared, the cost of cancelling the forward contract would be quite high. In addition, if the exchange rate at maturity was more favourable to the firm than the one agreed to in the forward contract, the firm will still have to honour the contract and will not be able to take advantage of the favourable exchange rate. Thus, with FEC there is the elimination of the opportunity for profit, should exchange rates turn out favourably. When purchasing a currency option, however, the holder is protected from downward movements in the exchange rate whist still having the opportunity to benefit if the currency moves favourably. Hence, the purpose of this thesis was to evaluate the use of currency options as an alternative hedging strategy to forward exchange contracts to manage the firm's foreign exchange risk. It was found that, had the firm used currency options as compared to FEC over the last four years, the firm would have made significant saving in spite of the option premium. The firm would have enjoyed the flexibility offered by currency options, that is, to let the contract lapse when it would not be to the firm's advantage thus making a lower payment for its imports than would be paid under the <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>contract</b> for the same period. The results were tested over a period of four years to prove that the difference in payments using the FEC and the currency options were statistically significant. What was apparent from the research, however, was that though the multinational firm could choose from a vast array of financial instruments and currency derivatives to manage its foreign exchange risk, the firm chose to stick to using forward exchange contracts. The reasons varied from fear of dealing with the complexities of the many instruments available on the market to the limited resources within the foreign exchange department to understand the technicalities of the various instruments. The investigation revealed though forward cover as used by the firm was more efficient in terms of ease of use. Currency options when applied to cover the firm's foreign imports resulted in less cash outflow, making it better and more profitable than forward exchange contracts. Options contract, though more expensive, would have allowed the firms to let the option lapse and therefore benefit from spot exchange rates if these were more favourable...|$|E

The analysis {{is based on the}} stochastic discount factor methodology, which imposes a no arbitrage condition on the relationship between the foreign exchange risk premium and its macroeconomic determinants. Estimation results suggest that U. S. inflation and consumption growth are important factors driving the risk premium, which is in line with the standard C-CAPM model. In addition, growth in international oil prices influences the risk premium, reflecting the important role played by the hydrocarbon sector in GCC economies. The methodology employed in this paper can be used for forecasting the risk premium on a monthly basis, which has important practical implications for policymakers interested in the timely monitoring of risks in the GCC.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} {{of foreign exchange}} (FX) swaps {{as a source of}} funding and as a hedging tool has focused attention {{on the role of the}} FX swap market in the recent crisis. The turbulence in international money markets spilled over into the FX swap market in the second-half of 2007 and into 2008, giving rise to concerns over the ability of banks to roll over their funding requirements and manage their liquidity risk. The turmoil also raised questions about banks'' ability to continue their supply of credit to the local economy, as well as the external financing gap it could create. In this paper, we examine the channels through which FX swap transactions could affect a country''s financial and economic stability, and highlight the strategies central banks can employ to mitigate market pressures. While not offering any judgment on the instrument itself, we show that the use of FX swaps for funding and hedging purposes is not infallible, especially during periods of market stress.

The issues that examined in this paper include what types of risk BA is facing, the types of financial derivative instruments BA's using to hedge against its risks, effectiveness of BA's hedging, the extent of its derivatives usage, and a numerical example showing derivative instruments {{can be used to}} hedge against the movement of oil price risk and which derivative is more effective. I found out that the use of financial derivatives by BA is for hedging purpose, but not for speculative or trading purposes. BA is facing financing and interest rate risk, foreign exchange risk, fuel price risk, credit risk and other risks. Therefore, BA employs a mixture of swaps, options, forward and futures to hedge against these risks. The Group uses <b>forward</b> foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>contracts</b> to hedge against near-term foreign exchange risk, uses interest rate swaps to hedge against financing and interest rate risks, and uses a number of derivatives that are available the over the counter markets (such as options and forward contracts). During the financial year of 2006, the derivatives used by BA were generally found to be effective. Moreover, a numerical example is used to show how forward/futures and options can protect BA against the movement of fuel price risk.

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the tax {{treatment}} of equity option contracts is examined. The writer gives {{an overview of}} the derivatives market in general and discusses the nature and effect of equity options in detail. Limited amendments have been made to the South African Income Tax Act No 58 of 1962 ('the Act') since the emergence of derivative instruments and at present only three types of derivative instruments are recognised: <b>forward</b> <b>exchange</b> and option <b>contracts</b> relating to <b>forward</b> <b>exchange,</b> interest rate swaps based on notional capital amounts and option contracts. Other than section 241 of the Act which deems all receipts and accruals from foreign <b>exchange</b> <b>contracts</b> to be income, the other sections dealing with derivatives do not concern themselves with capital or revenue classification. Accordingly, the classification of receipts and accruals arising from an equity option transaction is generally governed by the ordinary principles of South African tax law with the added problem of there being limited South African case law applying these general prinCiples to such transactions. The research undertaken in this thesis results in the establishment of a framework designed to determine the classification as revenue or capital the receipts and accruals arising from equity option contracts. Speculating, trading and investing in equity options is examined with regard to the general principles of South African tax and available case law. Hedging transactions are analysed with specific reference to their exact nature as well as general tax principles and available case law. The analogy of Krugerrands is used to draw parallels with the tax treatment of receipts and accruals arising from equity options used for hedging purposes. Once the theoretical framework has been established for revenue or capital classification, the actual tax treatment of both revenue and capital receipts is examined with reference to the Act and issues such as the gross income definition, the general deduction formula, trading stock and timing provisions are analysed and applied to receipts and accruals arising from equity option transactions.
