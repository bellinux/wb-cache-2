50|$|Foot pedals can be raised, {{relocated}} (for instance swapped {{to be used}} by {{the opposite}} leg) or replaced with hand-controlled devices. The common form of hand controls consists of a push-pull handle mounted below and projecting {{to the side of the}} steering wheel housing. The bar connects by levers to the accelerator and brake pedals, and is typically pivoted so that pushing applies the accelerator while pulling applies the brake. As there is no facility to work a clutch pedal, hand controls must generally be used in cars with automatic transmissions. With one hand continuously engaged working the hand controls, the steering wheel will generally also be fitted with a steering knob to allow one-handed use. More complex fittings may also connect into the electronic circuitry of the vehicle to place indicator and other switches in easy reach of the driver without requiring them to release the hand controls or steering knob. A <b>guard</b> <b>plate</b> may be fitted to prevent inadvertent contact between the driver's feet and the pedals. Extension levers or adapted grips may also be fitted to the parking brake to allow it to be applied by a driver with limited hand or arm strength.|$|E
40|$|To {{study the}} effects of mulches and crop {{residues}} on soil temperature, researchers have frequently used simulation models. In such models, quantification of heat transport within the mulch material is often weak and heat transport mechanisms are poorly understood. In this paper we describe an apparatus to quantify heat transport through dry mulch materials. In addition, heat transport mechanisms (conduction, thermal radiation, free and forced convection) can be identified and quantified using this apparatus. The apparatus consists of precisely controlled and monitored 0. 9 m by 0. 9 m hot and cold plates. The hot plate actually consists of three component plates: a test, a guard, and a bottom plate that are individually controlled (temperature) and monitored (temperature and power). The <b>guard</b> <b>plate</b> surrounds the test plate, minimizing undesired lateral heat flow. The bottom plate is positioned in parallel with the test and guard plates to insure that all wattage into the test plate moves {{off the top of the}} plate through the mulch. The correct functioning of the hot plate was verified using three reference materials with a known thermal resistance. The cold plate is based on techniques using thermoelectric devices (Peltier coolers). In addition, heat sinks and fans are used to transport heat away from the cold plate. A two–dimensional numerical simulation showed that errors caused by lateral heat flow in a sample contained between the hot and the cold plate can be neglected. The thermal conductivity of air was measured using the apparatus, yielding a value of 0. 026 W m– 1 ºC– 1, exactly matching the theoretical value, thus confirming the correct functioning of the hot/cold plate combination...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{concerns}} {{the development of}} a measurement method for determination in the field of the thermal conductivity of the insulation in buried district heating mains. The thermal conductivity of the insulation is calculated from the measured value of the radial heat flow through the heating main, the measured temperature difference across the insulation, and the dimensions of the heating main. The heat flow has been measured with a heat flux sensor which was fitted {{to the surface of the}} casing. The temperature has been measured with copper/constantan thermocouples. It is a necessary condition for the method used in the project for determination of the thermal conductivity of the heating main insulation that the heating main is uncovered and is not in contact with the surrounding soil over a distance of about 1. 5 m and that the measurements are made directly on the heating main. In this way, no account need be taken of the material surrounding the heating main, nor of the effect of this material on the measurements. No interference is needed with the heating main which would affect the distribution of the district heating water, and the heating main can remain in operation during measurements. Shielding insulation consisting of preformed insulation sections which were placed over the casing of the heating main and covered the heat flux sensor and some of the casing. The function of this insulation was to shield the heat flux sensor from external thermal disturbances. In the field measurements, a copper <b>guard</b> <b>plate</b> of 0. 5 mm thickness, the temperature of which could be adjusted, was also placed over the shielding insulation in order to maintain the temperature on the heat flux sensor as constant as possible. When temperature and heat flow are measured, the instruments used will be affected by conditions which prevail at the time of measurement. It is therefore very important to analyse the sources of error which may arise in the measuring situation at hand. The effect of these factors on the measured values has been studied by * laboratory measurements * theoretical calculations * field measurements On the basis of the resulting values of heat flows and temperatures obtained in field measurements on plastic heating mains which were operating under normal conditions, the thermal conductivity of the insulation of the main has been estimated. The method has been tested on plastic heating mains with directly foamed insulation, since this is the most common type of heating main both in the existing district heating network and in new construction. The measuring method can also be used on other circular heating mains...|$|E

40|$|The National Physical Laboratory (NPL) has {{developed}} a new design of <b>guarded</b> hot <b>plate</b> apparatus specifically for absolute measurements on thin specimens of medium thermal conductivity materials, such as the polymer composites that are becoming more widely used in aerospace and other advanced manufacturing sectors. Although NPL has an existing measurement facility based on a commercially manufactured apparatus conforming to ASTM E 1530, this current facility {{is not based on}} an absolute measurement technique and is not able to provide the low measurement uncertainty or flexibility that is increasingly being demanded by industrial users of this NPL service. The target specification for this new NPL <b>guarded</b> hot <b>plate</b> is the measurement of materials with thermal conductivity in the range 0. 1 – 10 W·m− 1 ·K− 1 using specimens with thickness of 1 – 20 mm and over the temperature range − 100 °C to 250 °C. This is achieved using a new design of <b>guarded</b> heater <b>plate</b> and a temperature-controlled environmental chamber.

The measuring apparatus, a Wind Box which has been designed and developed at the Department of Building Physics is described. This apparatus is a prototype; its main difference from a traditional <b>guarded</b> hot <b>plate</b> apparatus is its large measuring area (0. 6 x 1. 2 m) over which the material can be installed up to a thickness of 0. 5 m and its thermal resistance when exposed to an upwards heat flux determined. In designing the measuring process, calculation of the maximum systematic error has been a control parameter; this is less than 6 %. The study includes a review of the literature, measurements in a horizontal <b>guarded</b> hot <b>plate</b> apparatus, measurements in the Wind Box and calculations with a recently developed simulation program (CONVBOX) for three-dimensional convection problems.

30|$|The {{testing methods}} and {{procedure}} for {{the measurement of}} the TCC are also complicated and time-consuming. In general, there are three methods of measuring the TCC: the two-linear parallel probe method, the plane heat source method, and the hot <b>guarded</b> <b>plate</b> method (Morabito 1989; Carslaw and Jaeger 1959; Nevile 1995). All the three methods based on similar basic principles require additional efforts to cut the specimen thin and firmly place the thermal probe on/in the specimen, as well as long time control of the dependent and independent variables during the entire testing. Moreover, the conditions of concrete structures exposed to real environmental conditions might differ from those experimentally controlled. Therefore, {{for the evaluation of}} temperature distributions and thermal behaviors in the current state of concrete structures, an accurate prediction {{of the value of the}} TCC that can account for all these characteristics of the concrete is essential but very complex. For this reason, to investigate the complexity and influences of numerous factors on the TCC, we have employed a back-propagation neural algorithm that emerged as a new alternative to complicated pattern recognition in many fields such as the medical and biochemistry field.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: The Heat Flow Meter (HFM) Apparatus (ASTM C 518) {{can be an}} ex-tremely {{versatile}} {{test instrument}} used {{in a wide variety}} of conditions. Two special design HFM apparatuses are described here. They are Vacuum-Cryogenic and High Temperature (600 &deg;C) Heat Flow Meters. Calibration technique is the main key to obtaining useful information from testing under these unusual conditions. A few standards are available for use in these areas, however, others must be generated from <b>Guarded</b> Hot <b>Plate</b> (ASTM C 177) tests under similar conditions. Mathematical modeling and statistical regression methods are employed to obtain calibration equa-tions in order to calculate the coefficient or sensitivity under a variety of test condi-tions. Error analysis is used to estimate the uncertainty of these test measurements which is usually greater than under standard conditions. These types of calibration methods have proven to be viable and useful for many years at the Manville-Schuller Mountain Technical Center thermal test labs. This allows the use of HFMs in testing conditions traditionally reserved for <b>Guarded</b> Hot <b>Plates.</b> The lower cost, simpler design, and easier operation of the HFM apparatus are significant advantages...|$|R
