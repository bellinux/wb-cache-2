25|$|The {{remains of}} a young woman were found frozen in a creek by hunters on November 23, 2008, in Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin, near an {{abandoned}} farm. To extract the body, investigators were forced to chisel away the ice and scuba divers searched the bottom for evidence. Some articles of clothing were found, including a black and pink top with a pink bow, originating from Family Dollar, distributed in the spring of 2008. The underclothing that she wore, also from Family Dollar, was shipped only between July 1 and July 15, 2008. Her jeans were that of the Angels brand and the bottom of the legs had been rolled up, somewhat, and an elastic ponytail holder was found on her wrist. No socks or shoes were found at the scene. Initially, no jewelry was found, until a penny-sized St. Benedict medal was found by divers, but it may not have belonged to her, as examiners could not be certain <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been in the water. However, some reports claim that a bracelet containing several pendants was also found on the girl's remains. The hair was a shoulder-length light brown, possibly having hair highlights due to having some different shades. The clothing had caused some issues with investigators, as many of the different articles were in various sizes.|$|E
500|$|The gum {{varied in}} color {{depending}} {{on the condition of}} the original tree. It also depended on where the gum had formed and <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been buried. Colors ranged from chalky-white, through red-brown to black; the most prized was a pale gold, as it was hard and translucent. The size of each lump also varied greatly. Swamps tended to yield the small nuggets known as [...] "chips", whereas the hillsides tended to produce larger lumps. The majority were the size of acorns, although some were found which weighed a few pounds; the largest (and rarest) were reported to weigh half a hundredweight. Kauri gum shares a few characteristics with amber, another fossilised resin found in the Northern Hemisphere, but where amber can be dated as millions of years old, carbon-dating suggests the age of most kauri gum is a few thousand years.|$|E
500|$|In a 1994 {{interview}} with The Des Moines Register, Iowa State University economist Kenneth Stone stated that Merle Hay Mall successfully {{adapted to the}} changing lifestyles of the 1960s and 1970s by offering longer shopping hours {{during a time when}} downtown Des Moines merchants began restricting their hours. Author and Des Moines native Bill Bryson commented on how Merle Hay Mall's opening changed Des Moines in his 2006 memoir The Life and Times of the Thunderbolt Kid: [...] "My father never shopped anywhere else after that. Neither did most people. By the early 1960s, people exchanged boasts about <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been since they had been downtown. They had found a new kind of happiness at the malls." [...] In 1989's , Bryson wrote that [...] "Jack Kerouac, of all people, thought that Iowa women were the prettiest in the country, but I don't think he ever went to Merle Hay Mall on a Saturday" [...] when he commented on the obesity of Iowa women.|$|E

2500|$|On 16 October 1888 {{a parcel}} {{containing}} half a human kidney {{accompanied by a}} note was received by George Lusk, Chairman of the Whitechapel Vigilance Committee. The note {{has become known as}} the [...] "Lusk letter" [...] or the [...] "From hell" [...] letter, because of a phrase [...] "from hell" [...] used by the writer, who claimed to have [...] "fried and ate" [...] the missing kidney half. The handwriting and style were unlike that of the [...] "Saucy Jacky" [...] postcard. The kidney was taken to Dr Thomas Horrocks Openshaw at the nearby London Hospital. He believed that the kidney was human, from the left side, and preserved in spirit. The Daily Telegraph reported on 19 October that {{he said it was a}} recent [...] "ginny kidney" [...] from a 45-year-old female, but in the Star newspaper the same day Openshaw denied the report strongly, saying it was impossible to tell its age or gender, or <b>how</b> <b>long</b> <b>it</b> <b>had</b> been preserved in spirits. Major Smith claimed in his memoirs that the sent kidney matched the one missing from Eddowes, because the length of renal artery attached to the kidney matched the missing length from the body, and both the body and kidney showed signs of Bright's disease. Smith's later recollection does not match the medical reports submitted by the examining pathologists or the police records. Police surgeon Dr Brown said that the kidney had been trimmed up, and that the renal artery was entirely absent. Metropolitan police memos state that the kidney could have come from any body, such as those found in a hospital morgue. Smith's story is thought by historians to be dramatic licence on his part, and the kidney could have been a medical student's prank. Dr Saunders, who attended the post-mortem, told the press, [...] "the right kidney of the woman Eddowes was perfectly normal in its structure and healthy... my opinion is that it was a student's antic." [...] Chief Inspector Donald Swanson, who co-ordinated the inquiry, wrote, [...] "similar kidneys might and could be obtained from any dead person upon whom a post mortem had been made for any cause, by students or dissecting room porter." ...|$|E

Not the smallest suspicion, therefore, had ever occurred to prepare him for what followed;--and when at last it burst on him in a letter from Lucy herself, he had been for some time, he believed, half stupified between the wonder, the horror, and the joy of such a deliverance. He put the letter into Elinor's hands.|$|E

She cried all church time; for whenever she tried to attend to the prayers, the very sound of the voice she loved so well set her off again; and Sylvia, tenderly laying a hand on her by way of sympathy, made her weep the more, though still so softly and gently that it was like a strange sort of happiness--almost better than joy and merriment. And then the sermon--upon the text, [...] "Peace, be still,"-- was on the same thought on which her uncle had talked to the children: not that she followed it much; the very words [...] "peace" [...] and [...] "be still," [...] seemed to be enough to touch, soften, and dissolve her into those sweet comfortable tears.|$|E
