Their use has mostly been {{autologous}} (self); used fresh (in the form of a mixed cell population mainly sourced from adipose tissue), or expanded in number via culture; or allogeneic (non-self). The majority of their action via a paracrine effect, and hence the route of administration has been mostly via intra-articular injection. In vitro, this paracrine effect has been shown to enhance type II collagen expression in OA chondrocytes while decreasing matrix metalloproteinase activity (MMP-3 and MMP-13). In clinical cases, this has been shown via their anti-inflammatory/pain relieving effects. Dogs treated with adipose derived stem cell therapy have had significantly improved scores for lameness and compiled scores for pain and range of motion compared with control dogs. Other randomised studies have shown similar improved results with functional limitation, range of motion, and owner and veterinary investigator visual analogue scale for pain all showing improvement.

Single pedestal models, sometimes called load cells, are suitable for forces that are applied over a small area. For studies of movements, such as gait analysis, <b>force</b> <b>platforms</b> with at least three pedestals and usually four are used to permit forces that migrate across the plate.

40|$|In this study, {{we present}} a multi-treadmill system {{instrumented}} with three <b>force</b> <b>platforms</b> capable of measuring vertical and shear ground reaction forces and moments during both walking and running. Linearity, belts speed variations, repeatability of the measures, cross-talk, natural frequency, instrumental noise, moving part induced noise and drift were investigated. The noise due to vibrations and to moving parts was also investigated having a subject walking and running on the treadmill. The linearity test results showed a high linearity of all three treadmill <b>force</b> <b>platforms,</b> and vertical <b>force</b> natural frequency values of 219, 308, 307 Hz, obtained for the three <b>force</b> <b>platforms,</b> were considered appropriate for the investigation of walking and running. The instrumental noise {{did not appear to}} be a significant source of error. The characteristics of the noise due to vibrations and moving parts changed when in the presence of a subject walking and running on the treadmill. For walking trials, averaging of gait cycles led to a systematic improvement of the signal to noise ratio, particularly for the medio-lateral component of the force. For running trials, even though averaging was not as beneficial as for walking trials, the greater force amplitude led to a better signal to noise ratio value. This instrumented treadmill demonstrated acceptable accuracy and signal to noise ratios for all ground reaction force components such that it can be useful for a variety of research and clinical gait analysis applications...|$|R

50|$|A ground {{reaction}} force is {{the force that}} is exerted by the ground onto whatever body is {{in contact with the}} ground and is equal to the force that is placed on the ground. An example is the force that the ground exerts onto the foot and then up the leg of a person when walking and making contact with the ground. These can be measured by having a subject walk across a <b>force</b> <b>platform</b> and collect the forces exerted on the ground. These forces have long been thought to increase loads on the knee and would increase with greater mass from an obese person. This may be a predictor of osteoarthritis for an obese subject as the vertical force has been documented to potentially be the most significant force that is transmitted up the leg to the knee. In 1996, Messier and colleagues observed the differences in ground {{reaction force}}s between obese and lean older adults with osteoarthritis. They found that when they accounted for age and walking velocity, the vertical force was significantly positively correlated with BMI. Therefore, as BMI increased, the forces increased. They found this in not only the vertical force, but also in the anteroposterior and mediolateral forces. Because of the study population, this study did not compare obese adults with lean counterparts. Browning and Kram in 2006 observed two groups (one obese and one non-obese group) of young adult’s ground reaction forces across different speeds. They found that absolute ground reaction forces were significantly greater for the obese people than the non-obese group at slower walking speeds and at each walking speed the peak vertical force was approximately 60% greater. Absolute peak in the anteroposterior and mediolateral directions were also greater for the obese group but the difference was erased when scaled to body weight. Forces were also greatly reduced at slower walking speeds.|$|E

The gymnastics "cross" is a held isometric strength position considered fundamental to all still rings athletes. The purpose of this investigation was to determine if two small <b>force</b> <b>platforms</b> (FPs) placed on supports to simulate a cross position could demonstrate the fidelity necessary to differentiate between athletes who could perform a cross from those who could not. Ten gymnasts (5 USA Gymnastics, Senior National Team, and 5 Age Group Level Gymnasts) agreed to participate. The five Senior National Team athletes were grouped as cross Performers; the Age Group Gymnasts could not successfully perform the cross position and were grouped as cross Non- Performers. The two small FPs were first tested for reliability and validity and were then used to obtain a force-time record of a simulated cross position. The simulated cross test consisted of standing between two small <b>force</b> <b>platforms</b> placed on top of large solid gymnastics spotting blocks. The gymnasts attempted to perform a cross position by placing their hands at the center of the FPs and pressing downward with sufficient force that they could remove the support of their feet from the floor. Force-time curves (100 Hz) were obtained and analyzed for the sum of peak and mean arm ground reaction forces. The summed arm forces, mean and peak, were compared to body weight to determine how close the gymnasts came to achieving forces equal to body weight and thus the ability to perform the cross. The mean and peak summed arm forces were able to statistically differentiate between athletes who could perform the cross from those who could not (p < 0. 05). The force-time curves and small FPs showed sufficient fidelity to differentiate between Performer and Non- Performer groups. This experiment showed that small and inexpensive <b>force</b> <b>platforms</b> may serve as useful adjuncts to athlete performance measurement such as the gymnastics still rings cros...|$|R

The accelerometer was compared to the common reference standard of <b>force</b> <b>platform</b> analysis. Fifteen client-owned, orthopedically sound dogs of various breeds underwent simultaneous <b>force</b> <b>platform</b> and accelerometer gait trials to measure peak vertical forces (PVFs). The agreement between PVF for the accelerometer and <b>force</b> <b>platform</b> was measured using concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) and was found, overall, to be moderate [CCC = 0. 51; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 46 to 0. 56].

As measured by the accelerometer, PVF was systematically higher than as measured by the <b>force</b> <b>platform</b> (forelimbs 55. 3 N, hind limbs 144. 3 N).

40|$|A {{method of}} {{estimating}} force using an accelerometer is presented. This model is based on estimating the resultant acceleration of a body at its centre of mass using a triaxial accelerometer. A data set of ground reaction forces are gathered using a <b>force</b> <b>platform,</b> which is used as the control for this experiment. Signal processing techniques for resampling the accelerometer signals, along with a method of cross correlation to align the <b>force</b> <b>platform</b> and accelerometer traces are used.
