60|$|Something {{across the}} room seemed to attract his {{attention}} and <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> He inspected this for some time with bland interest, then turned to Adams once more.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{looking for}} work," [...] Cole murmured. [...] "Any kind of work. I can do anything, fix {{any kind of}} thing. I repair broken objects. Things that need mending." [...] <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> uncertainly. [...] "Anything at all." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> He {{was not a}} very {{intelligent}} young man, but even he could see that his was not a position where righteous indignation could be assumed with any solid chance of success. As a substitute he tried pathos.|$|E
6000|$|For {{several minutes}} after An-Tak ceased speaking, <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> having <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> weakly into silence, neither spoke again. Then the Galu recommenced his, [...] "Food! Food! There {{is a way}} out!" [...] Bradley tossed him another bit of dried meat, waiting patiently until he had eaten it, this time more slowly.|$|R
60|$|Lane's <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> Then {{the stony}} {{face of the}} {{listener}} changed for a fleeting second.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> The {{muscles of}} Jimmy's back {{tightened}} and quivered. But {{he could find}} no words.|$|R
6000|$|... 'By Jove!' There was {{apprehension}} in his voice, but {{mingled with}} it a certain pleased surprise. 'Perhaps they were after my picture. I'll light the lamp. Good Lord, picture thieves--Romneys --missing Gainsboroughs--' <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> as he found the lamp and lit it. Relief and disappointment were nicely blended in his next words: 'No, it's still there.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off,</b> {{and there}} was silence for a moment. Then Freddie burst into speech. His good-natured face was hard with unwonted scorn. Its cheerful vacuity had changed to stony contempt. For {{the second time in}} the evening the jolly old scales had fallen from Freddie's good old eyes, and, as Jill had done, he saw Derek as he was.|$|E
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> {{and failed}} from excess of emotion. Kate Bland {{closed her eyes}} and leaned her head on his breast. Duane felt her heart beat against his, and {{conscience}} smote him a keen blow. If she loved him so much! But memory and understanding of her character hardened him again, and he gave her such commiseration as was due her sex, and no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no," [...] {{she cried}} in sudden panic. [...] "You must go away." [...] Again her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off,</b> as she said, [...] "But I can't let you go." ...|$|R
60|$|The <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> Her mouth relaxed. And {{suddenly}} my old {{love for}} her seemed to gush back into my heart. A burning, inarticulate pity rose up in me.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> and {{she broke}} into stormy sobbing, while Andrew, {{with his arm}} around her, awkwardly tried to comfort her. His touch {{seemed to have a}} {{soothing}} influence, for Elsie got calmer.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{points the}} way," [...] came {{the voice of}} the oracle. [...] "The spirits are {{pointing}} the way to penitence, and urging the thief to restitution. I can see nothing more." [...] <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> into a silence that lasted solidly for many minutes, like the long silence below when the theft had been committed. Then it was broken by the ring of metal on the floor, and the sound of something spinning and falling like a tossed halfpenny.|$|E
40|$|Logic is a {{very elegant}} tool, ” he [Gregory Bateson] said, “And we’ve {{got a lot of}} mileage out of it for two {{thousand}} years or so. The trouble is, you know, when you apply it to crabs and porpoises, and butterflies and habit formation ” — <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off,</b> and he added after a pause, looking out over the ocean — “you know, to all those pretty things ” — and now, looking straight at me — “logic won’t quite do [...] . because that whole fabric of living things is not put together by logic. You see when you get circular trains of causation, as you always do in the living world, the use of logic will make you walk into paradoxes. ” He stopped again, and at that moment I suddenly had an insight, making a connection to something I had been interested in for a long time. I got very excited and said with a provocative smile: “Heraclitus knew that! [...] . And so did Lao Tzu. ” them. ” “Yes, indeed; and so do the trees over there. Logic won’t do for “So what do they use instead?” “Metaphor. ” “Metaphor?” “Yes, metaphor. That’s how the whole fabric of mental interconnections holds together. Metaphor is right at the bottom of being alive. ...|$|E
6000|$|... "--I don't know," [...] {{she went}} on. [...] "I must have time, either {{to work it}} out myself or to let it work itself out. If it only weren't for Dick..." [...] her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> pathetically.|$|R
60|$|Archie's <b>voice</b> had <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> He {{was looking}} across the room.|$|R
60|$|Again <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> {{away into}} a mumbling whisper, but now Uncle John and Donald looked into one another's eyes with sudden interest.|$|R
5|$|The {{world of}} Citizen Kane, that mysterious, dark, and {{infinitely}} deep world {{of space and}} memory where <b>voices</b> <b>trail</b> <b>off</b> into distant echoes and where meaning dissolves into interpretation, seemed to Bazin to mark the starting point from which all of us try to construct provisionally the sense of our lives.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{you were}} the only person left, and there wasn't any princess [...] " [...] Whiskers cried out abruptly, and then let <b>his</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trail</b> away to embarrassed silence.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am very sorry, my dear, but--oh, no! oh, no! oh, no--' <b>His</b> <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> {{away into}} an unintelligible mutter. He {{was a very}} old man, {{and he was not}} always able to {{concentrate}} his thoughts on a subject for any length of time.|$|R
60|$|When Professor Keith {{came up to}} bid Miss Rangely good-bye {{on the eve of}} her {{departure}} from Harbour Hill, he looked like a man who was being led to execution without benefit of clergy. But he kept himself well in hand and talked calmly on impersonal subjects. After all, it was Katherine who made the first break when she got up to say good-bye. She {{was in the middle of}} some conventional sentence when she suddenly stopped short, and her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> in a babyish quiver.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Possibly. And in that case'--I felt in my {{left-hand}} coat-pocket--'I {{had better}} be getting ready.' I felt in my right-hand coat-pocket. 'Ready,' I repeated blankly. A clammy coldness took possession of me. My <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> into nothingness. For in neither pocket was There {{a single one of}} the shells with which I had fancied that I was abundantly provided. In moments of excitement man is apt to make mistakes. I had made mine when, starting out on the sortie, I had left all my ammunition in the house.|$|R
60|$|Her <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off,</b> and {{the sisters}} sat in soft silence while an ancient crone, staff in hand, twisted, doubled, and {{shrunken}} under {{a hundred years}} of living, hobbled across the lawn to them. Her eyes, withered to scarcely more than peepholes, were sharp as a mongoose's, and at Bella's feet she first sank down, in pure Hawaiian mumbling and chanting a toothless mele of Bella and Bella's ancestry and adding to it an extemporized welcome back to Hawaii after her absence across the great sea to California. And while she chanted her mele, the old crone's shrewd fingers lomied or massaged Bella's silk-stockinged legs from ankle and calf to knee and thigh.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> fading <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> {{away into}} silence. A cough shook him, and the faint crimson foam {{on his lips}} was increased. But he rallied again, and lay there panting, his fingers {{plucking}} at the coverlet.|$|R
500|$|After {{the band}} track ends, the song moves into avant-garde territory, with Yoko Ono reciting some prose over an unknown, vaguely operatic {{recording}} (possibly captured {{live from the}} radio). Ono's piece begins with the words [...] "Maybe, it's not that…", with her <b>voice</b> <b>trailing</b> <b>off</b> at the end; Harrison jokingly replies, [...] "It is 'that'!" [...] As the piece continues, Lennon quietly mumbles [...] "Gonna be alright" [...] a few times. Then follows a brief piano riff, some comments from Lennon and Ono on how well the track has preceded, and final appearances of the tape loops. Most of this coda was lifted {{for the end of}} [...] "Revolution 9", with a little more piano at the beginning (which monitor mixes reveal was present in earlier mixes of [...] "Revolution") and minus Lennon's (or Harrison's) joking reply.|$|R
40|$|Figure 7 - Example mPower patient voice data. In the mPower app, PD {{patients}} are prompted {{to perform the}} voice activity three times per day: once before taking their medication, a second time when they feel they are at their best after taking their medication, and a third "random" time. This figure shows example voice data for a single patient on medication (top) and at a "random" time, very likely off medication (bottom). On the left are waveforms, showing the acoustic voice signal over time (0 - 10 seconds), from which one can clearly see that the patient's <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off</b> to a minimum (bottom left) compared to after medication (top left). On the right are spectrograms, representing signal amplitude at different frequencies (0 - 5 kHz) over time (0 - 10 seconds). The spectrogram after medication (top right) has more uniform frequency bands across the recording compared to the rather "muddled" spectrogram recorded at the random time (bottom right) ...|$|R
5000|$|During a Rangers/Padres {{broadcast}} on Monday, June 18, 2012, from Petco Park in San Diego, Barnett suddenly began making nonsensical statements during {{the bottom of}} the eighth inning. Rangers' pitching coach Mike Maddux was concluding a visit to the mound when Barnett, without warning, said, [...] "Go-ahead run is at fifth pause on what Adams is insisting on calling it a botched robbery. What actually happened was pause his henchmen took a piece literally out of [...] [...] [...] [...]" [...] At that point, Barnett's <b>voice</b> <b>trailed</b> <b>off.</b> It sounded as though he was struggling to say the words [...] "my" [...] and then [...] "his," [...] but could not do so. There was initial speculation that the broadcast production crew had turned off his microphone, but they actually had not done so. For about twenty seconds, Barnett was silent, with viewers hearing only ambient noise from the ballpark. Then, just as suddenly as the oddity appeared, it was over. Barnett began speaking again as if nothing had happened, and he finished the game without further incident.|$|R
50|$|Summer {{arrives and}} Dawn is {{relieved}} that school is {{over for the}} time-being. Mark tells Dawn that she cannot expect school life to get any better until she starts high school. As Dawn's parents continue mistreating and ignoring her, Dawn signs herself up to attend a summer camp in Florida. On a school trip to Walt Disney World, Dawn sits among other girls from her school and joins them in singing the school anthem. Unnoticed, her <b>voice</b> slowly <b>trails</b> <b>off</b> as she sits looking out a bus window.|$|R
