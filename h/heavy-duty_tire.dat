50|$|<b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>tire</b> changers require larger {{equipment}} {{because these}} changers deal with larger, heavier tires and wheels. <b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>tire</b> changers {{can work with}} some wheels up to 56 inches in diameter and tires up to 90.5 inches in diameter and 43 inches wide. <b>Heavy-duty</b> <b>tire</b> changers are used for agricultural, off-road and construction vehicles. However, now, bigger versions of the <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>tire</b> changers are designed to mount/demount tires up to 95 inches in diameter and also features a hydraulically operated self-centering four jaw chuck with clamping jaws that can clamp from 14 to 58 inches either from the wheel’s inside or from the center bore.|$|E
5000|$|Motorcycle tire changers {{are less}} {{sophisticated}} than passenger cars and light truck or <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>tire</b> changers because {{they deal with}} smaller and lighter tires and wheels. Motorcycle tire changers mainly provide a simple bead loosening system and rim clamps powered manually. Certain motorcycle tire changers can accommodate wheel diameters as small as 10" [...] and wheels at least 1-1/2" [...] wide. [...] In addition, small atv wheels and tires are used on motorcycle tire changers.|$|E

50|$|There are {{numerous}} variants {{on the traditional}} road tourer depending on the weight carried {{and the type of}} terrain expected. Expedition tourers are strongly built bicycles designed for carrying heavy loads over the roughest roads in remote and far-flung places. These range from simply stronger built mountain bikes, equipped with racks, panniers, mudguards and <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>tires,</b> to purpose-built bicycles built to cope with long-haul touring on tracks and unsealed roads in developing countries throughout Asia, Africa, and the other continents. Their frames are often made of steel as it is stronger, more flexible- therefore more comfortable over rough surfaces- and any breakages can technically be repaired virtually anywhere in the world.|$|R

500|$|The {{bicycles}} are utility bicycles with a unisex step-through frame, which weigh about [...] each. Their one-piece {{aluminum frame}} and handlebars conceal cables and fasteners {{in an effort}} to protect them from vandalism and bad weather; the handlebars are located above the seat, allowing riders to sit upright and thereby maintain balance. They are equipped with a Shimano Nexus three-speed, twist-shifter-operated internal geared hub, full mudguards/fenders and chainguard. The <b>heavy-duty</b> <b>tires</b> are puncture-resistant and filled with nitrogen to maintain proper inflation pressure longer. The tires are also wider, leading to increased stability. Twin LED rear lights of a pre-2015 design are integrated into the frame, whose bright-blue color increases the bikes' visibility. The bikes are designed by industrial designer Michel Dallaire and built in the Saguenay, Quebec, region by Cycles Devinci, with aluminum provided by Rio Tinto Alcan. Citi Bikes are slower than most utility bicycles, averaging only [...] as opposed to regular bicycles' average speed of , which increases safety due to a lowered risk of a high-speed collision. The bikes are assembled in Detroit.|$|R

50|$|A {{tire changer}} is a machine {{used to help}} tire {{technicians}} dismount and mount tires with automobile wheels. After the wheel and tire assembly are removed from the automobile, the tire changer has all the components necessary to remove and replace the tire from the wheel. Different tire changers allow technicians to replace tires on automobiles, motorcycles and <b>heavy-duty</b> trucks. New <b>tire</b> and wheel technology has improved certain tire changers {{to be able to}} change a low profile tire or a run-flat tire.|$|R

5000|$|The next presidential state {{car was a}} 1983 Cadillac {{that was}} {{delivered}} on January 30, 1984. [...] This Cadillac Fleetwood is 17 in longer and 3 in taller than the stock Fleetwood. [...] It featured armor and bulletproof glass (2+3/8 in thick), and was described as [...] "distinctively styled, with a raised roof and a large rear greenhouse." [...] To deal with the added weight of the armor, the car had oversized wheels and <b>tires,</b> <b>heavy-duty</b> brakes, and an automatic leveling system.|$|R
5000|$|Darts {{were offered}} to the taxicab {{industry}} for their whole production run from 1963 to 1976. While specifications varied by year, interior upgrades generally included heavy-duty front and rear black rubber floor mats, heavy-duty seat cushion springs with full foam back and air-foam seats, black all-vinyl trim with heavy canvas-backed vinyl seat covers, interior door pull assist straps or handles, and a door-ajar warning light for the driver. Mechanically, Dart taxicabs were generally equipped with <b>heavy-duty</b> brakes, <b>tires,</b> shock absorbers, front torsion bars and rear leaf springs, a high-output alternator, an increased-capacity cooling system and extra-lean carburetor calibration for greater economy. In 1976, the Chrome Yellow taxi package was available only with a 225 slant-six engine producing [...] and 170 lbft Nm; transmission was the (rare) A-727-RG (raised-deck motor, which was the slant-six series) with California emissions, [...] and 165 lbft Nm. Options included a radio suppression package and a Fuel Pacer System. Many—if not all—of them had a body color paint sales code of [...] "999", meaning special order paint ...|$|R
5000|$|The most sporty and {{powerful}} option was the Monte Carlo SS 454 package. Priced at $420, it included a standard Turbo-Jet 454 of 454 CID (7.4 L) with a four-barrel carburetor, rated at 360 hp (269 kW) at 4800 rpm. It also included <b>heavy-duty</b> suspension, wider <b>tires,</b> [...] "SS 454" [...] badging, and an automatic load-leveling rear suspension. The Turbo Hydra-Matic three-speed automatic {{was the only}} transmission available for this package. The rear axle came standard with a 3.06 ratio but was available in 2.56 and 3.31, although it still cost $222 (£142) extra. Weighing only {{a bit more than}} a comparably equipped Chevelle SS 454, the Monte Carlo SS was quite a fast car, although it accounted for less than 3% of Monte Carlos sold in 1970.|$|R
5000|$|Basic {{modifications}} are simple. A lightweight, shortened fiberglass {{front body}} panel is fitted after the sheet metal from the trunk lid edge forward and rear engine deck lid and everything rearward (rear apron and engine compartment) is removed. The rear treatment leaves the engine totally exposed to aid in cooling. A tubular steel cage front and rear bumper is fitted to the body and floor pan for protection of engine and occupants. Shortened fiberglass fenders both front and rear meant removal of the Beetle's distinctive running boards and the likely addition of more tubular steel parts (side bars) in their place. The rugged torsion bar front and rear suspension standard on the Beetle, allows it to withstand the rigors of offroading and the rear ride height to easily be raised slightly and stiffened to make clearance for larger <b>heavy-duty</b> off-road <b>tires</b> and wheels. The relatively light {{front end of the}} Beetle allows some compensation for the lack of four wheel drive. The taller sidewall tires provide more flexible ride comfort and rocky road ground clearance. The Beetle suspension [...] "stops" [...] can be moved to allow more suspension travel. Longer shock absorbers for the increase in suspension travel, provide more damping control over bumps giving more driver control and comfort. Some people eliminate the torsion bar suspension and install coilover-type springs that mount to a roll cage, allowing extreme amounts of travel with a very comfortable ride.|$|R
40|$|To {{produce a}} <b>heavy-duty</b> steel radial <b>tire,</b> the cords of brass plated ultra-high {{strength}} thin wires are embedded into rubber. The adhesion between the cords and rubber is mainly {{controlled by a}} thin layer of chemical compounds (for example, (Cu) _ S) formed between them during vulcanlzation and/or driving. The adhesive strength of them is usually measured by pulling out a cord from CER (Cords embedded in rubber) in tension (ASTM., AM., or SWAT. method) or by peeling out the cords from CER in tearing (peeling test). The adhesive force (kgf) is naturally controlled by both the interfacial adhesive stress (kgf/(mm) ^ 2) and the adhered surface area ((mm) ^ 2). The latter area in the above tests is often examined intuitively for convenience sake and the degree of adherence to surface area, that is the rubber coverage, is expressed into ten grades; for example, 100 %, 90 %, …. Thus, the adhesive force between the cords and rubber is given, but the interfacial adhesive stress which is controlled by the chemical adhesion between them can not be analysed from the measured force. Of course, if this adhesive stress is stronger than the cohesive stress of rubber componds, shear fracture will occur in the latter and the measured force in the above test is no longer the strength concerned with the adhesive stress between the cords and rubber. And it will be a different problem from the subject reported here. To analyse adhesive stress and/or to examine the adhesiveness between the cords and rubber we have to measure the other important factor, i. e., the interfacial adhesive area exactly in the above test. Here, we proposed a method of measuring the non-adhesive interfacial area quantitatively using a potentiostat, a pulse generator, an electrolytic cell and so on. The method is applied to more than one hundred commercial cords of brass-plated wires pull out in ASTM test and the results prove that the proposed method is useful for the exact measurement of rubber-coverage in practice. The method and the data are reported here in detail...|$|R
