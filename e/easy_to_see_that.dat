5|$|The {{right-hand}} {{side of the}} above equation is the sure information, i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database. In the example we considered above, it's <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the intersection of all possible models (i.e. the sure information) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because, for instance, the (unlifted) query returns no rows for the relation EmpH37. More generally, it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections, selections (and renaming of columns). However, {{as soon as we}} add either joins or unions to the query language, even this weak property is lost, as evidenced in the next section.|$|E

50|$|Of course, {{the above}} {{integrals}} may easily be evaluated {{in terms of}} elementary functions, but theyare presented as above because in the above-form it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the former integral is due to momentum-transfers which are perpendicular to the beam-direction whereas the latter is due to momentum-transfers parallel to the beam-direction.|$|R
25|$|If p is an {{isolated}} {{point in the}} Stone space, i.e. if {p} is an open set, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> every model realizes p (at least if the theory is complete). The omitting types theorem says that conversely if p is not isolated {{then there is a}} countable model omitting p (provided that the language is countable).|$|E
25|$|It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{the steps}} in the tree {{preserve}} the semantic truth value of the formulas implied by them, with conjunction understood between the tree's different branches whenever there is a split. It is also obvious that an axiom is provable {{if and only if}} it is true for every truth values of the atomic symbols. Thus this system is sound and complete in propositional logic.|$|E
25|$|A graph H {{is called}} a topological minor of a graph G if a {{subdivision}} of H is isomorphic to a subgraph of G. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> every topological minor is also a minor. The converse however is not true in general (for instance the complete graph K5 in the Petersen graph is a minor but not a topological one), but holds for graph with maximum degree not greater than three.|$|E

25|$|This {{problem is}} known to be NP-complete. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the problem is in NP: a yes answer is easy to prove by {{presenting}} a large enough cut. The NP-completeness of the problem can be shown, for example, by a transformation from maximum 2-satisfiability (a restriction of the maximum satisfiability problem). The weighted version of the decision problem was one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems; Karp showed the NP-completeness by a reduction from the partition problem.|$|E
25|$|These results contain several notable special cases. For example, {{the problem}} of {{computing}} the partition function of the Ising model is #P-hard in general, even though celebrated algorithms of Onsager and Fisher solve it for planar lattices. Also, the Jones polynomial is #P-hard to compute. Finally, computing the number of four-colourings of a planar graph is #P-complete, even though the decision problem is trivial by the four colour theorem. In contrast, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{counting the number of}} three-colourings for planar graphs is #P-complete because the decision problem is known to be NP-complete via a parsimonious reduction.|$|E
25|$|Internet {{connectivity}} also varies {{a lot by}} State. In 2011, the US Census Bureau {{conducted a}} survey to determine internet access in each State. New Hampshire reported {{the highest rate of}} Internet access, with only 20.3% reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. Mississippi reported the lowest rate of access, with 41.0% of people reporting no internet access at home or elsewhere. As a general trend it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> Appalachian and Southern States in general have a much lower rate of Internet usage when compared to other regions. This correlates greatly with the average income of those states. Lower income states reporting lower rates of usage, and higher income states reporting higher rates of connectivity. Also it may be a matter of population density. There are a lot more disconnected individuals in states with many counties of low population density. This could be because Internet Service Providers are less likely to make a profit in these areas.|$|E
25|$|These {{arguments}} (and {{the robot}} or commonsense knowledge replies) identify some special technology {{that would help}} create conscious understanding in a machine. They may be interpreted in two ways: either they claim (1) this technology is required for consciousness, the Chinese room does not or cannot implement this technology, and therefore the Chinese room cannot pass the Turing test or (even if it did) {{it would not have}} conscious understanding. Or they may be claiming that (2) it is <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the Chinese room has a mind if we visualize this technology as being used to create it.|$|R

5000|$|Another {{enduring}} {{judgment is}} in the appeal considered in R v Geddes. This decision is often cited in criminal appeals. Jordan held that after making allowance for any relevant considerations, {{there has to be}} a reasonable proportionality between a sentence and the circumstances of the crime, and that any sentence should be appropriate to the particular crime having regard to the gravity of the offence viewed objectively. He concluded <b>that</b> it was <b>easier</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> a wrong conclusion had been applied rather than arrive at any fixed rules for solving the problem. He concluded with the classic line [...] "the only golden rule is that there is no golden rule'.|$|R
25|$|Intuitively, {{imagine that}} {{we wish to}} {{transmit}} sequences comprising the 4 characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'D'. Thus, a message to be transmitted might be 'ABADDCAB'. Information theory gives a way of calculating the smallest possible amount of information that will convey this. If all 4 letters are equally likely (25%), we can do no better (over a binary channel) than to have 2 bits encode (in binary) each letter: 'A' might code as '00', 'B' as '01', 'C' as '10', and 'D' as '11'. Now suppose 'A' occurs with 70% probability, 'B' with 26%, and 'C' and 'D' with 2% each. We could assign variable length codes, so that receiving a '1' tells {{us to look at}} another bit unless we have already received 2 bits of sequential 1s. In this case, 'A' would be coded as '0' (one bit), 'B' as '10', and 'C' and 'D' as '110' and '111'. It is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> 70% of the time only one bit needs to be sent, 26% of the time two bits, and only 4% of the time 3 bits. On average, then, fewer than 2 bits are required since the entropy is lower (owing to the high prevalence of 'A' followed by 'B' – together 96% of characters). The calculation of the sum of probability-weighted log probabilities measures and captures this effect.|$|E

500|$|Although {{using the}} Fourier transform, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> this generates a semigroup in some sense—it is not {{absolutely}} integrable and so cannot define a semigroup {{in the above}} strong sense. [...] Many nascent delta functions constructed as oscillatory integrals only converge {{in the sense of}} distributions (an example is the Dirichlet kernel below), rather than in the sense of measures.|$|E
50|$|Positive-definiteness arises {{naturally}} {{in the theory}} of the Fourier transform; it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> directly <b>that</b> <b>to</b> be positive-definite it is sufficient for f to be the Fourier transform of a function g on the real line with g(y) &ge; 0.|$|R

500|$|In {{her fifth}} paper on cyclols (1937), Wrinch {{identified}} {{the conditions under}} which two planar cyclol fabrics could be joined to make an angle between their planes while respecting the chemical bond angles. [...] She identified a mathematical simplification, in which the non-planar six-membered rings of atoms can be represented by planar [...] "median hexagon"s made from the midpoints of the chemical bonds. [...] This [...] "median hexagon" [...] representation made it <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> the cyclol fabric planes can be joined correctly if the dihedral angle between the planes equals the tetrahedral bond angle δ = arccos(-1/3) ≈ 109.47°.|$|E
500|$|The {{essential}} {{idea here}} is intuitive and probably qualifies as folk wisdom. [...] It was articulated by Kurt Vonnegut in his 1961 short story Harrison Bergeron. In Vonnegut’s futuristic dystopia, the Handicapper General uses {{a variety of}} handicapping mechanisms to reduce inequalities in performance. [...] A spectator at a ballet comments: [...] "it was <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she was the strongest and most graceful of all dancers, for her handicap bags were as big as those worn by two hundred pound men." [...] Zahavi interpreted this analogy to mean that higher quality peacocks with bigger tails are signalling their ability to [...] "waste" [...] more of some resource by trading it off for a bigger tail. This resonates with Thorstein Veblen's idea that conspicuous consumption and extravagant status symbols can signal wealth.|$|E
500|$|From {{the outset}} of the marriage, {{political}} members of the Rothschild family took an interest in Rosebery, and he was soon acclaimed as one of the rising hopes of the Liberal Party. As a hereditary peer, he already had a seat in the House of Lords and had made his maiden speech there on attaining his majority. But brilliant as he was, Rosebery tended to lethargy and boredom. Lord Granville in fact considered Rosebery's wife to be the more ambitious of the pair, and even advised her [...] "If you keep him up to the mark, [...] is sure to have his page in history." [...] The subtle driving of her often languid and lethargic husband to achieve his [...] "page in history" [...] was to become her [...] Rosebery's secretary Thomas Gilmour noted: [...] "She is thoroughly genuine and very tender and devoted to Lord Rosebery, it is <b>easy</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> she is very proud of him, and she is a woman of considerable force of character and great energy, she may prove to be a powerful ally in his political career." [...] Rosebery was not a natural politician. He was an idealist who disliked the rancour of politics, in fact [...] "his innate dislike of politics was something Lady Rosebery always fought against." [...] However, he was a gifted orator, and this was an era when platform speaking was beginning to replace House of Commons debate. On a tour of America before his marriage, Rosebery had been impressed by the campaigning of prospective political candidates; in Britain little had changed in that respect since the hustings of the 18th century. He realised how an electorate could be swayed by a candidate touring his prospective constituency, aided by a well thought-out series of events, rallies and advertising, with the candidate's ideal and attractive family smiling by his side. Thus Lady Rosebery not only pushed and encouraged him behind the scenes but was now to become an encouraging and conspicuous figure by his side. In this way it could be said she was the first openly [...] "political wife" [...] in Britain.|$|E
