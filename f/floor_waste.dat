40|$|Powder {{technology}} {{can be used for}} solid state recycling of metallic waste (e. g. iron oxide as forging scales in the forge shop and grinding sludge from the machine shop). Whereas recycling of such shop <b>floor</b> <b>waste</b> by melting and landfill are well known, that by powder metallurgical process has not received significant attention in published literature. The present work attempts to fill this gap. Initially, waste material (forging scale and grinding sludge) was separately pulverised using ball mill to obtain the respective powders. For carbothermic reduction, graphite (powder of particle size < 5 mu m) was homogeneously mixed with the two oxide powders. Each of the two mixtures was compacted in a die into a number of pellets. These were sintered for in-situ reduction of the metallic waste. The effect of the source of powder (grinding sludge or oxide scale), quantity of reducing agent cum lubricant, i. e., graphite powder, compaction parameters such as compaction pressure, compact weight and sintering parameters such as sintering temperature and time on reduction and densification characteristics were analysed using Taguchi based experimental design. The results showed significant effect of graphite content and sintering temperature on the degree of reduction and densification. The source of scrap was found to be important since samples from grinding sludge showed higher reduction and densification than forging scale. The analysis of variance was used to establish the individual effects and interactions like that between source of scrap and graphite addition. This was found to contribute most towards degree of reduction and densification. It was found that degree of reduction alone does not necessarily guarantee high degree of densification.

40|$|With annual {{renewable}} {{water resources}} {{of less than}} 150 m 3 per capita, Jordan {{is one of the}} most water scarce countries of the world. The demand for freshwater resources has been on the increase in the urban sector due to the economic development and population growth. The limited amount of water available for agriculture necessitates the use of non-conventional water resources, such as gray water, as an alternate option. Gray water refers to domestic wastewater generated by baths, showers, hand basins, <b>floor</b> <b>wastes,</b> washing machines, and dishwashing, which has not been mixed by toilet wastes. Its treatment and reuse offers an attractive option in arid and semi-arid regions due to its role in promoting the preservation of high-quality freshwater, as well as reducing environmental pollution. Additional benefits include cost savings to both the consumer and state water authorities, through reduced sewage flows and potable water supplies. This resource comprises about 50 - 80 % of house water consumption in the rural areas of Jordan. In times of unpredictable rainfall resulting from climate change, gray water provides a reliable supply of water for home farming to irrigate high-value crops, contributing to food security and income generation at the household level. Gray water reuse research activities in Jordan, conducted mainly by the National Center for Agricultural Research and Extension (NCARE) in cooperation with several national and international organizations, reveal its high potential for irrigation of residential gardens, especially in rural areas. However, there is a need for further research in gray water treatment and quality improvement to reduce environmental risks and enhance sustainable use. In partnership with the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA), NCARE is addressing these aspects through community-based interventions leading to safe and productive use of gray water for crop production...|$|R

40|$|The {{enhancement}} of wood waste is a promising {{solution for the}} production of energy from renewable resources. Nevertheless, wood waste often needs a preliminary treatment step to remove pollutants present in the material. The thermal cleaning of wood laminated <b>flooring</b> (WLF) <b>waste</b> is studied through thermogravimetric and FTIR analyses. As a first step, it has been shown, through non iso-thermal tests, that degradation temperature ranges for wood and additives (aminoplast resins) are different, making it possible to proceed to a thermal cleaning through a low temperature pyrolysis. It has also been highlighted that chemical linkages between the different components of WLF waste influence their own thermal behaviour making it difficult to predict the thermal behaviour of the whole material. Fourier transform infra-red spectrometry analyses reveal that NH 3 and HNCO are the main nitrogen-containing gases produced during pyrolysis, which highlights the pyrolysis efficiency in terms of nitrogen (i. e., resin) removing. Lastly, thermal degradation of wood and WLF has been modelled to provide information for reactor designing...|$|R

Growers can account for spatial variation in weed density and only spray weedy areas instead of applying herbicide to entire fields by using the automatic spot-sprayer, WeedSeeker sprayer. We conducted field experiments in flood- and microsprinikler-irrigated lemon orchards, and flood- and sprinkler-irrigated pecan orchards to measure the amount of herbicide applied, weed control, tree yield, and the economic value of adopting the WeedSeeker sprayer compared to conventional boom spray technology. The WeedSeeker sprayer reduced cumulative herbicide use by at least 36 % compared to the conventional boom sprayer at all sites. Weed control obtained using the WeedSeeker sprayer was usually similar to the conventional boom sprayer. There were no effects of the treatments on yield at any location. The partial budget analysis, {{used to determine the}} economic value of adopting the technology, showed that as the area of the orchard and the cost of the herbicide increased, the time to recover the initial investment in the WeedSeeker sprayer decreased. The investment in the technology can typically be recovered in less than five years in Arizona lemon and pecan orchards. We also conducted greenhouse experiments to determine the effect of various sensitivity settings and leaf area on the operational efficiency of the WeedSeeker sprayer. The WeedSeeker sprayer did not detect and spray all broadleaf and monocot plants unless a sensitive setting was used. The WeedSeeker sprayer was more efficient when detecting broadleaf plants compared to monocot plants. Our results indicate that operating the WeedSeeker sprayer using a sensitive setting (sensitivity level 2) will result in the most efficient detection of weeds. Finally, field studies were conducted in a non-bearing pecan orchard to evaluate weed management systems using various postemergence and preemergence herbicides. Most postemergence herbicides controlled the weed species present in the orchard. Tank mixing the herbicides generally resulted in greater control compared to applying them alone. All preemergence herbicides reduced the weed emergence compared to not using a preemergence herbicide. No pecan tree damage was observed in any treatment...|$|R
30|$|Livestock waste can be {{recycled}} by many modern ways {{in order to}} combat rising energy prices, sustainable agricultural and reduce the environmental threats from traditional livestock waste management practices. India, China, Germany, Malaysia, Brazil {{are some of the}} leading countries in world to take advantage of biogas technology. The results of initial trials of biogas bottling plants in India demonstrated that the biogas can be pure up to 98  % methane content. The pure biogas can be successfully filled into CNG cylinders to use as vehicular fuel. The bottled biogas was found to replace crude oil, hence, having a bright future. The algae cultivation in waste water is good option to recycle the carbon dioxide a potent green house gas; moreover, algal biomass can be converted into many value-added products like bio-oil. The dead animals and birds can be successfully composted to make nutrient-rich compost. The composting of pig carcasses may be carried out in bins built from treated wood, concrete or bales of hay, over a concrete <b>floor.</b> High-moisture organic <b>waste</b> can be composted using low-moisture bulking agents such as straw, sawdust, peat, peanut shells, rice hull, etc. Vermicomposting is not only a powerful method of recycling the organic waste but it has potentiality for employment generation especially in rural areas. However, the better substrate in shorter period can be obtained from combined process of composting and vermicomposting. Integrated fish farming in wallowing pond or poultry or duck waste-fed aquaculture is a very promising enterprise that can provide additional income to farmers.|$|R
