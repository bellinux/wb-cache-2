Over land, patches of large-radius aerosols appear over deserts and arid regions, most prominently, the Sahara Desert in north Africa and the Arabian Peninsula, where dust storms are common.

On June 11, Alexei managed to convince the people to allow Morozov to be exiled to the Kirillo-Belozersky monastery in Siberia. As the ashes settled, and half of Moscow lay in ruin, the riot gradually dissipated. Soon, however, the provincial nobility, big merchants, and top townsmen seized the initiative and came out with a petition demanding the convocation of the zemsky sobor, or Assembly of the Land, to discuss salary <b>distribution,</b> <b>time</b> limits for recovering escaped serfs, and other legalities. However, the Assembly lacked the voices of the serfs, leading to the institutionalism of serfdom instead of granting them concessions. Upon Morozov's removal, Alexei appointed a new boyar group led by Prince Yakov Cherkassky and boyar Nikita Romanov. They began distributing money, lands and souls to the dvoryane and made a few concessions to the remaining rebels, including the postponement of collection of arrears on 12 June. The government’s measures widened the split among the rebels, leading to the arrest and execution of many {{of the leaders of the}} uprising on July 3. On 22 October, Boris Morozov secretly returned to Moscow under Alexei’s order, and resumed his position as the head of the Russian government, relieving Nikita Romanov of the post.

The paper {{presents}} a fitness formula which is adopted {{to calculate the}} steel ball temperature uniform <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> in the annealing process, analyses the steel ball temperature distribution {{in the process of}} heating. After the heat conduction equation of the steel ball is deduced, the spherical bessel function is adopted to solve it. The temperature distribution series solution is obtained. Using this formula, the steel ball temperature uniform <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> of the different radius is calculated in the process of annealing. The result shows that the steel ball temperature uniform <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> is the quadratic function of the steel ball radius. The time and radius data is adopted to deduce a second-order fitness polynomial. The steel ball temperature distribution is obtained in the different position. The steel ball temperature uniform <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> is calculated by the fitness formula and the temperature distribution series one. The error between them is only 0. 03 %.

40|$|Abstract — Distributing large video files or {{operating}} system images over the Internet requires file servers with high bandwidth and large storage capacity. Overlay networks, including content distribution networks (CDN) and peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems, are promising network models for large file distributions. Both CDN and P 2 P leverage bandwidth and storage resources between content distribution servers and individual nodes, {{so that they}} can scale to a larger number of nodes easily. Previous work on large file distri-bution mainly focused on minimizing the <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> of a fully connected overlay network. In a fully connected overlay network, each individual node is connected to every other node in the network. However, most practical CDN and P 2 P systems are based on a partially connected mesh topology, where nodes are typically connected to a subset of other nodes. In this paper, the <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> of practical mesh-based overlay systems is analyzed and a lower bound on the file <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> is established. Our algorithms consist of two steps. First, we decompose the mesh network into multiple spanning trees so that the load on each node is balanced. We show that the construction of balanced spanning trees is NP-complete and propose a few heuristics to tackle it. The second step, we derive the optimal system <b>distribution</b> <b>time</b> based on the multiple spanning tree topology, node bandwidths and file size. In this step, an optimal file segmentation algorithm is developed, in which a file is divided into unequal-sized pieces and allocated to individual nodes based on the available bandwidth. We vali-date our theoretical analysis via experiments and investigate how system design parameters, such as node churning and implementation complexity, affect system <b>distribution</b> <b>time.</b> Index Terms — content distribution networks (CDN), peer-to-peer networks (P 2 P), mesh network, file distribution, overlay networks.
