25|$|These {{three key}} {{concepts}} – locality, realism, freedom– are highly technical and much debated. In particular, {{the concept of}} realism is now somewhat different {{from what it was}} in discussions in the 1930s. It is more precisely called counterfactual definiteness; <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may think of outcomes of measurements that were not actually performed as being just as much part of reality as those that were made. Locality is short for local relativistic causality. (Currently accepted quantum field theories are local in the terminology of the Lagrangian formalism and axiomatic approach.) Freedom refers to the physical possibility of determining settings on measurement devices independently of the internal state of the physical system being measured.|$|E

2500|$|The {{concepts}} {{raised by}} Gödel's incompleteness theorems {{are very similar}} to those raised by the halting problem, and the proofs are quite similar. [...] In fact, a weaker form of the First Incompleteness Theorem is an easy consequence of the undecidability of the halting problem. This weaker form differs from the standard statement of the incompleteness theorem by asserting that a complete, consistent and sound axiomatization of all statements about natural numbers is unachievable. The [...] "sound" [...] part is the weakening: <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> require the axiomatic system in question to prove only true statements about natural numbers. The more general statement of the incompleteness theorems does not require a soundness assumption of this kind.|$|E

60|$|Now {{here comes}} in the whole {{collapse}} and huge blunder of our age. We have mixed up two different things, two opposite things. Progress should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are always changing the world to suit the vision. Progress does <b>mean</b> (just now) <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are always changing the vision. <b>It</b> should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are slow but sure in bringing justice and mercy among men: <b>it</b> does <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are very swift in doubting the desirability of justice and mercy: a wild page from any Prussian sophist makes men doubt <b>it.</b> Progress should <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are always walking towards the New Jerusalem. <b>It</b> does <b>mean</b> <b>that</b> the New Jerusalem is always walking away from us.

In other words: can we reformulate {{the problem of}} the Utility of K (that P) as “convenience to believe’? “It is convenient to me to believe it, then I believe it!” No. We have not to confuse or identify the advantage, utility of K (if believed and used) 44 with the advantages, utility of believing that P.|$|R
2500|$|The British Government, in authorising {{the letters}} {{despatched}} to King Hussein [...] before {{the outbreak of}} the revolt by Sir Henry McMahon, would seem to raise a doubt as to whether our pledges to King Hussein as head of the Arab nation are consistent with French intentions to make not only Syria but Upper Mesopotamia another Tunis. If our support of King Hussein and the other Arabian leaders of less distinguished origin and prestige means anything <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> are prepared to recognize the full sovereign independence of the Arabs of Arabia and Syria. It would seem time to acquaint the French Government with our detailed pledges to King Hussein, and to make it clear to the latter whether he or someone else is to be the ruler of Damascus, which is the one possible capital for an Arab State, which could command the obedience of the other Arabian Emirs.|$|E

60|$|We {{need not}} {{debate about the}} mere words {{evolution}} or progress: personally I prefer to call it reform. For reform implies form. It implies that {{we are trying to}} shape the world in a particular image; to make it something that we see already in our minds. Evolution is a metaphor from mere automatic unrolling. Progress is a metaphor from merely walking along a road--very likely the wrong road.

60|$|Now the “forever,” in the conclusion, means, for {{any length}} of time that can be supposed; but in the premises, “ever” does not mean any length of time; it means any number of subdivisions of time. <b>It</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> may divide a {{thousand}} feet by ten, and that quotient again by ten, and so on as often as we please; that there never needs be an end to the subdivisions of the distance, nor consequently to those of the time in which it is performed. But an unlimited number of subdivisions may be made of that which is itself limited. The argument proves no other infinity of duration than may be embraced within five minutes. As long as the five minutes are not expired, what remains of them may be divided by ten, and again by ten, as often as we like, which is perfectly compatible with their being only five minutes altogether. It proves, in short, that to pass through this finite space requires a time which is infinitely divisible, but not an infinite time; the confounding of which distinction Hobbes had already seen to be the gist of the fallacy.|$|E
60|$|How is it, {{says one}} of the interlocutors, that the strongest, the sweetest, the most {{innocent}} of pleasures is become the most fruitful source of depravation and misfortune? This is indeed a question well worth asking. And it is comforting after the anarchy of the earlier part of the dialogue to find so comparatively sensible a line of argument taken in answer as the following. This evil result has been brought about, he says, by the tyranny of man, who has converted the possession of woman into a property; by manners and usages that have overburdened the conjugal union with superfluous conditions; by the civil laws that have subjected marriage to an infinity of formalities; by religious institutions that have attached the name of vices and virtues to actions that are not susceptible of morality. If this means that human happiness will be increased by making the condition of the wife more independent in respect of property; by treating in public opinion separation between husband and wife as a transaction in itself perfectly natural and blameless, and often not only laudable, but a duty; and by abolishing that barbarous iniquity and abomination called restitution of conjugal rights, then the speaker points to what has been justly described as the next great step in the improvement of society. If <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> do wrong to invest with the most marked, serious, and unmistakable formality an act that brings human beings into existence, with uncounted results both to such beings themselves and to others who are equally irresponsible for their appearance in the world, then the position is recklessly immoral, and it is, moreover, wholly repugnant to Diderot's own better mind.|$|E
