5|$|It is {{possible}} that the age of fusion–evaporation reactions to produce superheavy elements <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> due to the increasingly short half-lives to spontaneous fission and the looming proton drip line, so that new techniques such as nuclear transfer reactions (for example, firing uranium nuclei at each other and letting them exchange protons, potentially producing products with around 120 protons) would be required to reach the superactinides. On the other hand, many changes in techniques have been needed to synthesise transuranium elements, from neutron capture (until Z = 100) to light-ion bombardment (until Z = 110) to cold fusion (until Z = 113) and now hot fusion with 48Ca (until Z = 118), not to mention the essential difference before and after uranium between finding the elements chemically or spectroscopically in nature and synthesising them. In spite of this, the rate of discovery of new elements has remained at one every {{two and a half years}} on average for the past two and a half centuries.|$|E

25|$|On July 1, 2015, the Lightning signed {{free agent}} forward Erik Condra to a three-year {{contract}} with a $1.25 million average. Condra had played the previous five seasons with the Ottawa Senators, which is the team he was originally drafted by in the 2006 NHL Draft in the 7th round. Condra had 9 goals and 14 assists in 68 games. Condra {{is known for his}} strong work on the penalty kill, which could make Condra a key third/fourth-line player and penalty killer for the Lightning. Condra also has ties to Lightning head coach Jon Cooper, who played for him while Cooper was coach of Texarkana of the USHL. The signing of Condra likely means that Brenden Morrow's tenure with the team <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end.</b> Later in the day, the Lightning announced the signing of free agent defensemen Matt Taormina to a one-year, two-way contract. Taormina played 76 games with the Worcester Sharks of the AHL, notching 11 goals and 38 points. This will be Taromina's second stint with the organization, having previously played with both the Lightning and the Crunch over two seasons.|$|E

The flanks of the volcano do not pose a lower threat to the population than the area near the rift zones because the distance is short and the slopes are steep; lava poses as much of a threat as it does near its source.|$|E
500|$|... "A Totally Fun Thing That Bart Will Never Do Again" [...] is the 19th {{episode of}} the 23rd season of the American {{animated}} television sitcom The Simpsons. It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. In the episode, the Simpson family goes on cruise after being convinced by a bored Bart. He enjoys himself on the vacation until Rowan Priddis, {{the director of the}} cruise, performs a song called [...] "Enjoy It While You Can" [...] that makes him realize the cruise is soon to be over and he has to return to his boring life. Bart decides to trick the crew and the passengers on the ship that the world <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> back on land because of a pandemic and that the ship therefore has to stay out at sea.

She dances with four male dancers in the first chorus. During the second chorus, she dances with four other female dancers dressed in cheerleading outfits, while many men are watching them dance. The screen fades to white and Spears begins to change into a conservative '50s-inspired housewife outfit. As the chorus begins again, she comes out of her bedroom. She walks down the stairs, with dancers surrounding her and a woman gives her a potholder, which she uses to pick up a pie. After this, she walks out the front door of the house and is joined by her seemingly conservative-looking husband and children, one of them dressed with the schoolgirl outfit Spears wore in the [...] "...Baby One More Time" [...] video. As they go down the walkway, they are surrounded by paparazzi, who have no idea what goes on behind closed doors. While the kids and husband wave, Spears smiles for the camera and blows a kiss. The video then ends with the news anchor saying, [...] "Doesn't make any sense, does it?".|$|E

Solomon later places a chess piece of Darkseid onto the Source Wall as a memento of his victory and then witnesses Donna Troy, Kyle Rayner, Ray Palmer, and Forager agreeing to act as watchmen for the Monitors at the urging of Nix Uotan, who is impressed by the Challengers selflessness and repulsed by his brethren's lack of foresight.|$|E

2500|$|The anointed {{ones and}} the seventy years (Chapter 9): Daniel reinterprets Jeremiah's [...] "seventy years" [...] prophecy {{regarding}} the period Israel would spend in bondage to Babylon.

Daniel therefore reinterprets the seventy years as seventy [...] "weeks" [...] of years, making up 490 years. The 70 weeks/490 years are subdivided, with seven [...] "weeks" [...] from the [...] "going forth of the word to rebuild and restore Jerusalem" [...] to the coming of an [...] "anointed one", while the final [...] "week" [...] is marked by the violent death of another [...] "anointed one", probably the High Priest Onias III (ousted to make way for Jason and murdered in 171 BC), and the profanation of the Temple.

When Tristan arrives, Isolde reproaches him about his conduct and tells him that he owes her his life and how his actions have undermined her honour, since she blessed Morold's weapons before battle and therefore she swore revenge. Tristan first offers his sword but Isolde refuses; they must drink atonement. Brangäne brings in the potion that will seal their pardon; Tristan knows that it may kill him, since he knows Isolde's magic powers ("Wohl kenn' ich Irland's Königin"). The journey almost at its end, Tristan drinks and Isolde takes half the potion for herself. The potion seems to work {{but it does not}} bring death but relentless love ("Tristan!" [...] "Isolde!"). Kurwenal, who announces the imminent arrival on board of King Marke, interrupts their rapture. Isolde asks Brangäne which potion she prepared and Brangäne replies, as the sailors hail the arrival of King Marke, that it was not poison, but rather a love potion.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the next}} match {{was made at}} the request of Kane, and had its roots in both a shift in {{character}} for Kane and a match at the previous year's Survivor Series. Kane's storyline brother, The Undertaker, challenged Vince McMahon to a Buried Alive match. Kane, who had adopted a much more sadistic persona since being forced to unmask back in June 2003, interfered in the match and buried his brother under several tons of dirt, apparently killing him. On the November 20 episode of SmackDown, Kane appeared to give the eulogy for his brother, claiming that The Undertaker was no longer his brother and had died a long time before that as he no longer embraced his dark side. This rewarded him a title match for the World Heavyweight Championship at Armageddon (2003) which it was won by Triple H in a triple threat match also involving Goldberg. Two months later, Kane participated in the Royal Rumble and was eliminated by Booker T after the bell from The Undertaker's old theme music began playing just to upset and distracted him. Over the following weeks, Kane repeatedly insisted that The Undertaker was [...] "dead", only to be met with various paranormal incidents such as a rainstorm localized over the ramp on which he stood. On the last episode of Raw, Kane appeared to the ring and saw an empty Casket standing in the ring but as he opened it, he saw an urn inside of it. He then grabbed the microphone and asked if that's what he's been looking forward to. He also stated it's going to take more than an empty casket and an urn to intimidate and beat him. He then stated that the Undertaker's legacy, his 11–0 WrestleMania streak and his life <b>is</b> <b>coming</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> <b>end</b> as he said [...] "it's back to the grave for you for good". As he claimed that It's over and that he's not afraid of the Undertaker. The lights turned out but this time, the 10,000 pound wrestling ring lifted off the ground with Kane standing in it and tilted side ways, which would be the final message sent from the Undertaker before their match at WrestleMania XX.|$|E
