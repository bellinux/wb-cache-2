Long-term minimum targets are 35% by 2020, 50% by 2030 and 80% by 2050. The country is increasingly producing more electricity than it needs, driving down spot-market prices and exporting its surplus of electricity to its neighboring countries (record exported surplus of 32 TWh in 2013 and 34 TWh in 2014). A decline in spot-prices may however raise the electricity prices for retail customers, as {{the spread of the}} guaranteed feed-in tariff and spot-price increases as well. As the combined share of <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> and solar is approaching 17 percent on the national electricity mix, other issues are becoming more pressing. These include, adapting the electrical grid, constructing new grid-storage capacity, dismantling and altering fossil and nuclear power plants - brown coal and nuclear power are the country's cheapest suppliers of electricity, according to today's calculations - and to construct a new generation of combined heat and power plants.|$|E

40|$|The wind {{mechanical}} forcing of {{the ocean}} general circulation and its seasonal variations are examined using available observational products, focusing {{on the role of}} the mean and <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds.</b> It is found that including wind fluctuations in the stress calculation produces a qualitative change in the estimates of the mean and seasonal wind stress, particularly at mid and high latitudes where the synoptic wind variability is large. This effect of wind fluctuations on air-sea momentum exchange has immediate dynamical consequences for the large-scale ocean circulation. For example, power input to the ocean general circulation and subtropical gyre transport can be underestimated by more than 50 % if the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds</b> are not taken into account. However, the impact of including wind fluctuations depends strongly on the presence of the mean winds. If the mean winds are ignored in the stress calculation, the net effect of the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds</b> is to take energy out {{of the ocean}} owing to the skewness of the near-surface wind field. Furthermore, covariances of wind fluctuations are found to explain most of the effect of the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds,</b> while the variable drag coefficient makes a non-negligible contribution in the Southern Ocean. These results imply that paleo and future climate studies need to take into account the changes of the large-scale low-frequency wind field as well as the synoptic weather systems...|$|R

40|$|<b>Fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> {{power is}} due to wind {{turbulence}} and is the part which should be filtered out leaving behind the more predictable mean wind power which can be traded in the hourly energy market. The power fluctuations cause the frequency of electric utility to deviate from the 60 Hz standard. This thesis is concerned with estimating the maximum <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> power before the 1 % deviation from the 60 Hz standard (required by some utilities) is exceeded. To keep the thesis manageable, the scope is narrowed to thermal power plants with governor speed control but no Automatic Governor Control (AGC). This thesis shows that each governor speed control system provides energy storage buffer to attenuate the wind power fluctuations and arrives at the estimate that the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> power penetration is conservatively around 5 % of the generation capacity of the utility grid. The methodologies used to reach this estimate are: (i) Transfer Function analysis of power plants; (ii) digital simulations using HYPERSIM. Through the research, an innovative method of predicting the frequency deviation in an electric grid with multiple power plants has been developed and validated by simulation. The thesis also shows that <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> power penetration can be higher when there are filtering also in the wind farms. Wind turbines, with small inertias, driving constant speed squirrel cage induction generators are found to provide poor filtering. On the other hand, the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> power penetration limit is increased to 18 % {{in the case of}} wind turbines, with large inertias, driving variable-speed doubly-fed induction generators (DFIG) with decoupled P-Q control to implement optimal wind power acquisition...|$|E

30|$|As {{a result}} of the {{increasing}} of the train speed, the aerodynamics of high-speed trains has attracted great attention. Strong crosswinds seriously affect the operation safety of high-speed trains. Incidents of train derailments and overturns in strong winds have been reported from around the world with recent incidents being reported in Japan, Italy, Belgium, Switzerland, and China. A great deal of research has been carried out to investigate the operational safety of high-speed trains. In the past, most research on the aerodynamic performance and safety characteristics of high-speed trains under crosswinds are based on uniform wind hypothesis [1, 2, 3, 4]. However, the natural winds are not constant but instantaneous, and have fluctuating characteristics. The analysis based on uniform wind hypothesis is much different from the actual situation; thus, it is important to carry out the research on the aerodynamic characteristics of high-speed trains in <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds.</b> At present, extensive research work has been carried out on the vehicle–bridge coupling vibration [5, 6], in which the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds</b> at fixed points are considered, and the unsteady aerodynamic loads of high-speed trains are calculated based on the quasi-steady expression. Cooper [7] derived the <b>wind</b> spectrum of <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds</b> at a moving point shifting with high-speed trains based on von Karman spectrum, which is Cooper theory. Baker [8] found that, compared with the spectrum of <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds</b> at a fixed point, the wind spectrum of a moving point based on the Cooper theory will move to the higher frequency part. The quasi-steady expression assumes that force fluctuations follow velocity fluctuations. In reality, the quasi-steady assumption does not hold completely, and the force fluctuations do not completely follow the velocity fluctuations as the small-scale turbulence in the oncoming wind is not fully correlated over the entire exposed area of a train. The aerodynamic admittance function can solve the problem. This parameter is a normalized ratio of the force spectrum to the wind spectrum and can be measured in experiments. Baker et al. [9, 10] carried out several wind tunnel tests, and obtained the aerodynamic admittance function of high-speed trains. Recently, Baker [11] has studied the variation of the unsteady side force and lift force of a vehicle at different operating speeds according to the actual situation of trains. However, the characteristics of aerodynamic moments and the impact of yaw angle on statistical characteristics of aerodynamic loads are not considered in Baker’s research.|$|R
3000|$|To {{study the}} {{unsteady}} aerodynamic loads of high-speed trains in fluctuating crosswinds, the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds</b> of a moving point shifting with high-speed trains are calculated {{in this paper}} based on Cooper theory and harmonic superposition method. The computational fluid dynamics method is used to obtain the aerodynamic load coefficients at different mean yaw angles, and the aerodynamic admittance function is introduced to calculate unsteady aerodynamic loads of high-speed trains in <b>fluctuating</b> <b>winds.</b> Using this method, the standard deviation and maximum value of the aerodynamic force (moment) are simulated. The results show that when the train speed is fixed, the varying mean wind speeds have large impact on the fluctuating value of the wind speeds and aerodynamic loads; in contrast, when the wind speed is fixed, the varying train speeds have little impact on the fluctuating value of the wind speeds or aerodynamic loads. The ratio of standard deviation to 0.5 ρ Ku̅^ 2, or maximum value to 0.5 ρ Ku̅^ 2, can be expressed as the function of mean yaw angle. The peak factors of the side force and roll moment are the same ([...] 3.28), the peak factor of the lift force is [...] 3.33, and the peak factors of the yaw moment and pitch moment are also the same ([...] 3.77).|$|R

Typhoon-induced non-stationary wind speed is modelled as a deterministic time-varying mean wind speed component plus a zero mean stationary <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> speed component. The time-varying mean wind speed is naturally extracted from the measured wind speed time history using empirical mode decomposition (EMD).

40|$|This paper explores how to {{characterize}} nonstationary wind speed {{that can be}} modeled as a deterministic time-varying mean wind speed component plus a stationary random process for the <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> speed component. The time-varying mean wind speed is naturally extracted from the nonstationary wind data using the empirical mode decomposition (EMD). The proposed approach is then applied to the wind data recorded by the anemometers installed in the Tsing Ma suspension Bridge during Typhoon Victor to find its time-varying mean wind speed, probability distribution of <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> speed, wind spectrum, turbulence intensity, and gust factor. The resulting wind characteristics are compared with those obtained by the traditional approach based on a stationary wind model. It is found that most of nonstationary wind data can be decomposed into a time-varying mean wind speed plus a well-behaved <b>fluctuating</b> <b>wind</b> speed admitted as a stationary random process with a Gaussian distribution. The time-varying mean wind speed identified by EMD at a designated intermittency frequency level is more natural than the traditional time-averaged mean wind speed over the certain time interval.
