After Charles regained consciousness, and his fever subsided, he {{was returned to}} Paris by Harsigny, moving slowly from castle to castle, with periods of rest in between.

5|$|Guido Forti {{alleged that}} Shannon Racing had not paid him any money within the stipulated six-day {{deadline}} after {{the deal was}} concluded and refuted the claim that it now owned 51% of his team. As the team ran out of money, it was doubtful whether it would turn up at the British GP. In the end, Forti took part, only for the cars to complete a mere handful of laps each in practice and thus failing to set a time quick enough to qualify. This was because it was becoming increasingly in debt to Cosworth and {{was running out of}} engine mileage for its cars, only having <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> token effort at participation. The team made it to the next race - the German GP - but both cars remained unassembled in the pit garages throughout the weekend after the engine supply was finally cut off.|$|E
5|$|Sargent as {{composer}} attracted favourable {{notice in}} a Prom season when other composer-conductors included Gustav Holst with his Planets suite, {{and the next}} year, Wood included a nocturne and scherzo by Sargent in the Proms programme, also conducted by the composer. Sargent was invited to conduct the Impression again in the 1923 season, {{but it was as}} a conductor that he made the greater impact. On the advice of Wood, among others, he soon abandoned composition in favour of conducting. He founded the amateur Leicester Symphony Orchestra in 1922, which he continued to conduct until 1939. Under Sargent, the orchestra's prestige grew until it was able to obtain such top-flight soloists as Alfred Cortot, Artur Schnabel, Solomon, Guilhermina Suggia and Benno Moiseiwitsch. Moiseiwitsch gave Sargent piano lessons without charge, judging him talented <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> successful career as a concert pianist, but Sargent chose a conducting career. At the instigation of Wood and Adrian Boult he became a lecturer at the Royal College of Music in London in 1923.|$|E

He was probably hit by Captain Gerald Maxwell, though the latter did not receive credit for a victory. Berthold overcame the handicap of half-severed ailerons and remained conscious long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> smooth one-handed landing at Jasta 18's home airfield.

25|$|A {{technical}} {{concern is}} that the 14 MeV neutrons produced by the fusion reactions will damage the materials from which the reactor is built. Research is in progress to determine whether and how reactor walls can be designed to last long <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> commercial power station economically viable {{in the presence of the}} intense neutron bombardment. The damage is primarily caused by high energy neutrons knocking atoms out of their normal position in the crystal lattice. A related problem for a future commercial fusion power station is that the neutron bombardment will induce radioactivity in the reactor material itself. Maintaining and decommissioning a commercial reactor may thus be difficult and expensive. Another problem is that superconducting magnets are damaged by neutron fluxes. A new special research facility, IFMIF, is planned to investigate this problem.|$|E

25|$|The {{strategy}} {{of building a}} business around posting free comics online began in the 1980s, when Eric Millikin created the first webcomic, Witches and Stitches for CompuServe in 1985. Self-publishing on the internet allowed Millikin to avoid censorship and the demographic constraints of mass-market print publishers. Millikin's comics were instantly popular with the early internet audience around the world, inspiring other comics artists to follow. However, at that time a large online audience and influence did not necessarily translate into enough sales to reach economic success. By the 1990s, Millikin had moved to publishing comics on the then-new World Wide Web, but was homeless, living in a car, and working in an anatomy lab as an embalmer and dissectionist of human cadavers. Since then, Millikin has achieved professional webcomic success, including through turning his webcomics into award-winning print-published work and commissioned public art, and by selling original artwork in gallery exhibitions. By 1999, Millikin {{was one of the}} few, and first, webcomic creators successful <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> living as an artist. He now often donates a portion of his profits to charities.|$|E
25|$|However, another account {{states that}} after {{his brother was}} shot, Bonifacio was stabbed and hacked to death. This was {{allegedly}} done while he lay prone in a hammock {{in which he was}} carried to the site, being too weak to walk. This version was maintained by Guillermo Masangkay, who claimed to have gotten this information from one of Macapagal's men. Also, one account used to corroborate this version is of an alleged eyewitness, a farmer who claimed he saw five men hacking a man in a hammock. Historian Milagros Guerrero also says Bonifacio was bayoneted, and that the brothers were left unburied. After bones said to be Bonifacio's – including a fractured skull - were discovered in 1918, Masangkay claimed the forensic evidence supported his version of events. Writer Adrian Cristobal notes that accounts of Bonifacio's captivity and trial state he was very weak due to his wounds being left untreated; he thus doubts that Bonifacio was strong <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> last dash for freedom as Macapagal claimed. Historian Ambeth Ocampo, who doubts the Bonifacio bones were authentic, thus also doubts the possibility of Bonifacio's death by this manner.|$|E
