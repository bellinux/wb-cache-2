40|$|Distiller’s grains {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in the U. S. Corn Belt, where producers commonly feed dry-rolled or highmoisture corn. Fuel ethanol production is expanding into the High Plains, where most feedlots flake grain. Compared with dry- rolled corn, steam-flaked corn usually increases or has no change in average daily gain, yields lower dry matter intake and results in 12 to 16 % improvement in efficiency. Previous research at Kansas State University and elsewhere suggests {{that the value of}} distiller’s grains is different in flaked grain diets than in dry-rolled diets. We think this might be due to lower rumen pH when <b>flaked</b> <b>grains</b> are fed, perhaps reducing digestibility of the diet, especially the fibrous components. Because distiller’s grains contain considerable amounts of fiber, {{it might be possible to}} add less roughage to finishing diets that contain distiller’s grains, and doing so, improve efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted to}} determine the effects of grain processing, grain sources, protein sources, and bST treatments on lactation performance, ovarian activity and nutrient digestion in early lactation dairy cows. In experiment 1, forty-eight dairy cows were divided into six groups and fed diets containing 37 to 39 % grain as either steam-flaked sorghum (SFS, 360 g/L), steam-flaked corn (SFC, 360 g/L), or steam-rolled corn (SRC, 490 g/L) with one of two protein sources, soybean meal (SBM) or Prolak® for 70 days. Main effects for grain and protein source were not different for DMI, milk yield, 3. 5 % FCM yield or feed efficiency. Although efficiency of feed conversion into FCM did not differ among treatments, cows fed Prolak® required 10 % less NEL for every Mcal of NEL converted into body weight or FCM. Milk protein yield was increased by both flaked gain and Prolak®. Feeding flaked grain increased milk production by 1. 5 kg/d compared with rolled grain. Increasing the ratio of RDS/RDP to more than 2. 4 increased milk yield by 2. 7 kg/d (39. 0 vs 36. 3 kg/d). Plasma NEFA levels did not differ among treatments and grain and protein source had variable effects on PUN. Compared with other grains, SFC increased digestibilities of DM and OM, and <b>flaked</b> <b>grains</b> increased digestibility of starch. Cows fed SFS had the lowest crude protein digestibility, but was highest in NDF. In experiment 2, thirty-two postpartum (5 DIM) Holstein cows were assigned to one of four treatments in a 2 x 2 factorial design for 90 days. Treatments were: steam-flaked sorghum diet with bST (SFS-B); steam-flaked sorghum diet without bST (SFS-N); steam-rolled corn diet with bST (SRC-B); and steam-rolled corn diet without bST (SRC-N). Cows receiving bST during the first 45 days of treatment had lower DMI and DMI as % of BW. Milk yield was increased by bST 3. 1 kg/d and 1. 8 kg/d during the 45 d and 90 d periods, respectively, resulting in greater feed efficiency for bST-treated cows. Grain processing did not affect DMI, milk yield and FCM yield. Neither composition nor yields of milk components were influenced by treatments. Compared to the SRC diet, SFS increased plasma glucose 5 % and plasma insulin 19 %. Grain processing and bST had no effect on either BHBA or hepatic triglycerides. PUN was reduced by bST, but NEFA was increased. Compared with SRC, SFS increased progesterone during the first two postpartum estrous cycles and cows receiving bST had significantly larger CL. Flaked sorghum compared with SRC increased digestibility of DM, OM, and starch, and neither grain affected digestibilities of CP, NDF or ADF. Treatments with bST did not affect any nutrient digestibilities...|$|E
40|$|Escalating {{costs of}} natural gas and {{electrical}} utilities have greatly increased the cost of <b>flaking</b> <b>grain</b> for feedlots. Energy demand for flaking is inversely related to bulk density of flaked grain; the lighter, more highly processed flakes typically require longer steaming times and greater roll pressures, which ultimately decreases mill. Corn is most commonly flaked to a density of about 28 lb/bushel, and published research results indicate that levels less than 28 lb/bushel afford no further advantage with respect to animal performance. Little information is available concerning the relative feed value of <b>grains</b> <b>flaked</b> to heavier bulk densities. <b>Flaking</b> <b>grains</b> to heavier bulk densities could {{make it possible to}} increase mill throughput and reduce energy costs associated with flaking.

40|$|Advantages {{of steam}} <b>flaking</b> <b>grain</b> are less {{with respect to}} growth {{performance}} and diet digestion when a portion of distillers grains is substituted for grain. Ruminal pH typically is lower in cattle fed flaked-grain diets than in cattle fed rolled-grain diets. Ruminal pH for cattle fed finishing diets based on steam-flaked corn is observed below pH 6. 0. Previous research observed a 5 % decrease in digestion of organic matter when 13 % distillers grains (dry-matter basis) was added to steam-flaked corn finishing diets. A decline in ruminal pH below 6. 2 reduces activity of ruminal fiber-digesting organisms. Furthermore, ruminal protein digestion declines with pH below 5. 5. It is plausible that low ruminal pH may restrict digestion of distillers grains in flaked-grain diets.

40|$|Distiller’s grains are {{the primary}} {{coproduct}} derived from fuel ethanol production. As the fuel ethanol industry expands into the High Plains, distiller’s grains are becoming increasingly available as an alternative feed for livestock. Optimizing the use of distiller’s <b>grains</b> in <b>flaked</b> <b>grain</b> rations is important to maintaining a competitive advantage among feedlot producers in this region. Because distiller’s grains are relatively high in fiber, {{it is conceivable that}} the level of roughages in feedlot diets could be reduced when distiller’s grains are fed to cattle. Roughages normally have low energy density; therefore, the cost per unit of energy from roughages usually is relatively high compared with cereal grains or grain co-products. If the use of distiller’s grains would allow roughage levels to be decreased in finishing diets without deleterious consequences for health or performance, this generally would be viewed as a positive attribute. Our objective was to evaluate performance of feedlot cattle fed diets with and without distiller’s grains, and assess the effect of reducing the level of added roughage in diets containing distiller’s grains...|$|R

Feed mills associated with cattle feed yards are experiencing the effects of the Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAAS) of 1990 through the implementation of Title V of the act. This law requires any feed mill that qualifies as a major pollutant source (i. e. by emitting more than 90. 7 tonnes (100 tons) of a regulated pollutant annually) to obtain from its state air pollution regulatory agency (SAPRA) a federal operating permit (FOP).

The graphites were provided in the form of fuel spheres and a reflector block. The techniques used in the analysis of the materials include fracturing, etching, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), nano-indentation, x-ray diffraction (XRD) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The microstructures of the materials were characterized successfully. The fuel sphere material consisted of a high concentration of curved graphite <b>flakes</b> and <b>grains</b> in contact with turbostratic matrix graphite. The well graphitized <b>flakes</b> and <b>grains</b> were polycrystalline in nature. Delamination cracks were prevalent in the graphite crystallites.

Delamination cracks were observed within the graphite crystallites, and many cavities were present in the material. TEM observation also revealed the presence of diamond crystallites. It was concluded that the fuel sphere graphite was most probably suitable for use as is, provided that the material also possessed other required properties for use in a HTTR.

40|$|Modern {{industry}} uses a lot {{of elements}} as additives to improve the service characteristics of metal products {{that are to be}} used for various purposes. These elements can be divided into two groups: the first group includes the elements interacting with iron and improving its characteristics (alloying elements), and the second group includes the elements, that modify the characteristics of the structure and properties in an undesirable direction. These are trace elements: S, P, O, As, and others in steel. The negative impact of these elements shows itself as banding, the formation of non-metallic inclusions, <b>flakes,</b> <b>grain</b> boundary segregations et al. The influence of the elements of the both groups on the properties of steel depends on the nature and level of interatomic interaction in the alloy. Computational and analytical study of the major impurity elements in steel impact on the interatomic bond strength and the probability of forming complexes, clusters, and chemical compounds with the basic alloying elements in the steel has been carried out in the work. The theoretical parameter which defines the strength of the ion-covalent bond of two atoms: non-metallic – metallic is the electronegativity of elements. The electronegativity difference of the metal and non-metallic elements increasing, the ionic bonding and thermodynamic stability of these compounds  increase. On the other hand, concentration of valent electrons is a universal characteristic of an atomic element which determines many of its properties, and especially the energy of interatomic interaction. Energy calculations of pairwise interatomic impurity elements: H, C, N, S, P, As interaction with Fe and major alloying elements in steel: Mn, Cr, Si, V, Al, Ti, W, Cu, Mo, Nb were made. It has been stated that all the impurity elements except phosphorus, hydrogen and arsenic have sufficient high adhesion with the majority of the metal elements in the modern steels. Phosphorus does not form stable compounds with metals, but has a tendency to form grain boundary segregation (GBS). Niobium, molybdenum and titan change the nature of phosphorus distribution in steel and prevent GBS. Carbon, nitrogen and sulfur are impurity elements having higher energy of ion-covalent interaction with the main metals in steel, therefore tend to form clusters, complexes and chemical compound...|$|R

All diets contained an animal protein supplement and no antibiotics. Pigs fed diets based on steam-flaked corn and steam-flaked sorghum had a lower incidence of disease (11 – 33 %) than pigs fed diets based on other grains (75 – 100 %). Pigs fed the diet based on cooked white rice were fully protected against swine dysentery.

40|$|The core–shell {{structure}} in oriented cylindrical rods of polypropylene (PP) and nanoclay composites (NCs) from PP and montmorillonite (MMT) is studied by microbeam small-angle x-ray scattering (SAXS). The structure of neat PP is almost homogeneous across the rod showing regular semicrystalline stacks. In the NCs the discrete SAXS of arranged crystalline PP domains {{is limited to}} a skin zone of 300 μm thickness. Even there only frozen-in primary lamellae are detected. The core of the NCs is dominated by diffuse scattering from crystalline domains placed at random. The SAXS of the MMT flakes exhibits a complex skin–core gradient. Both the direction of the symmetry axis and the apparent perfection of flake-orientation are varying. Thus there is no local fiber symmetry, and the structure gradient cannot be reconstructed from a scan across the full rod. To overcome the problem the rods are machined. Scans across the residual webs are performed. For the first time webs have been carved out in two principal directions. Comparison of the corresponding two sets of SAXS patterns demonstrates the complexity of the MMT orientation. Close to the surface (< 1 mm) the flakes cling to the wall. The variation of the orientation distribution widths indicates the presence of both MMT <b>flakes</b> and <b>grains.</b> The grains have not been oriented in the flowing melt. An empirical equation is presented which describes the variation from skin to core of one component of the inclination angle of flake-shaped phyllosilicate filler particles...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{increasingly}} strict {{environmental regulations}} regarding extraction of gravel the concrete industry {{need to reduce}} the use of gravel {{and replace it with}} crushed aggregates in concrete. Gravel is very suitable for concrete because of its round grain shape with a smooth surface and very often also a suitable particle size distribution. Crushed aggregates very often have a more <b>flake</b> <b>grain</b> shape and higher content of fine particles. The characteristic of crushed aggregates depends on parameters such as; type of rock, crushing method and degree of refinement. With a suitable rock type and by choosing the right crushing setup it is possible to produce crushed aggregates for concrete. The use of VSI crushers may improve the grain shape but is not always necessary. In case of very high content of fines an air classifier can be used to reduce the filler content (or by washing). Concrete consists of cement, water, aggregates and very often also additional materials and admixtures. Replacing gravel with crushed aggregate as a direct 1 : 1 substitute might be difficult because of the grain shape of crushed aggregates and its higher fine content. Very often mix-design adjustments are required to achieve the same concrete properties as with gravel and to ensure the fresh concrete workability it might be needed to increase the cement paste. For environmental and concrete technical reasons, it is desirable to substitute gravel with crushed aggregates without increasing the cement paste and to succeed, it requires some kind of refinement of the hard rock. When choosing crush methods to improve the properties of the crushed aggregates decisions always include economic considerations and it is necessary to understand how varying degrees of processing effect the concrete properties. This include a need for test methods that makes it possible to determine if a crushed material is good enough for concrete. This master thesis aims to investigate if it is possible to determine if a crushed aggregate is suitable for concrete by using some practical and simple aggregate test methods. Aggregates with different degree of refinement has been used in the study; conventional crushed and materials processed with a VSI and an air classifier. Fine aggregates 0 / 4 mm and also the properties of the fines, particles smaller than 0, 25 mm, {{have a major impact on}} the concrete workability so focus in this investigation is crushed aggregates smaller than 4 mm. The results from this work show that there are correlations between the outcomes from aggregate tests and from concrete tests and that it is possible to assess if a crushed material is suitable for concrete without carry out a large scale concrete tests. It is difficult to assess a material with only one single aggregate test method but a combination of two tests methods describes well how the material will behave in a concrete. Important when producing crushed aggregates for concrete is the particle shape and the particle size distribution. These two parameters are important for how the material affects the concrete properties and aggregate test methods that can describe these parameters are desirable.

40|$|The {{coercivity}} of isotropic Dy-coated Nd-Fe-B flakes was {{enhanced by}} crystallization and simultaneous diffusion of Dy from their surfaces. Amorphous Dy-coated Nd-Fe-B flakes were crystallized by heating them to 923 K 2 over a 2 min period followed by rapid cooling. During crystallization, the Dy {{on the surface}} diffused into the flakes. This low-temperature rapid annealing produced <b>flakes</b> with fine <b>grains</b> and the Dy diffusion enhanced their coercivity. The coercivity after crystallization increased with increasing Dy layer thickness, although the remanence decreased when the layer thickness exceeded 3 μm. Thick coatings of over 6 μm resulted {{in the formation of}} DyFe 2, which degraded the magnetic properties of the crystallized flakes. Flakes with a 3 -μm-thick coating exhibited excellent magnetic properties after annealing: They had a coercivity of 1880 kA/m and a remanence of 78 emu/g. This coercivity is approximately 500 kA/m higher than that of uncoated flakes, whereas the remanence is comparable to that of uncoated flakes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{presents}} microstructural {{as well as}} {{bulk and}} mineral chemical investigations of deformation bands in uncemented, friable arkosic sands of Miocene age (Vienna Basin, Austria). Our microstructural study indicates grain size reduction by <b>grain</b> <b>flaking</b> in deformation bands with small offsets (0. 5 – 8  cm), and dominant intragranular fracturing and cataclasis of altered feldspar grains at larger displacements (up to 60  cm). Relative to quartz, the sericitized feldspar grains are preferably fractured and abraded, which additionally leads to an enrichment of mainly phyllosilicates by mechanical expulsion from feldspar. Both cataclasis of quartz and feldspar grains and enrichment of phyllosilicates result in grain size reduction within the deformation bands. The measured reduction in porosity of up to 20 % is in some cases associated with a permeability reduction, reflected in the retention of iron-oxide rich fluids along deformation bands. These deformation bands formed at very shallow burial depths in unconsolidated sediments indicate that fault sealing may occur {{in the absence of}} chemical alteration of the deformation bands and lead to a compartmentalization of a groundwater or hydrocarbon reservoir...|$|R
40|$|Semiconducting {{transition}} metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) {{have been applied}} as the active layer in photodetectors and solar cells, displaying substantial charge photogeneration yields. However, their large exciton binding energy, which increases with decreasing thickness (number of layers), {{as well as the}} strong resonance peaks in the absorption spectra suggest that excitons are the primary photoexcited states. Detailed time-domain studies of the photoexcitation dynamics in TMDs exist mostly for MoS 2. Here, we use femtosecond optical spectroscopy to study the exciton and charge dynamics following impulsive photoexcitation in few-layer WS 2. We confirm excitons as the primary photoexcitation species and find that they dissociate into charge pairs with a time constant of about 1. 3 ps. The better separation of the spectral features compared to MoS 2 allows us to resolve a previously undetected process: these charges diffuse through the samples and get trapped at defects, such as <b>flake</b> edges or <b>grain</b> boundaries, causing an appreciable change of their transient absorption spectra. This finding opens the way to further studies of traps in TMD samples with different defect contents...|$|R
