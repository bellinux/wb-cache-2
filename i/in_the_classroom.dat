40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this {{research}} project {{was to determine the}} perceptions and attitudes of teachers in their use of technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> and their support for its use. A survey was used on three distinct groups of 60 teachers to investigate how these groups of teachers felt about their use of technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> Test-retest was used to measure for reliability. The key research questions included teachers use technology, supports/resources, and interfere with the use of technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> <b>The</b> result of this study showed that the faculty members feel that technology education is important and that they feel encouraged to use computer technology and need more support in using technology <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms.</b> This study will contribute to confirm leaders at each of sites used for <b>the</b> project <b>in</b> order that staff development and the purchase of equipment are purposeful and directed...|$|R

5|$|Most {{teachers}} {{are required to}} address HIV/AIDS in their curricula; although instructors are, for the most part, committed to helping their students understand and avoid the disease, they face many obstacles that prevent them from informing their students about HIV/AIDS in productive ways. For example, some teachers cannot advise their students to remain faithful to their sexual partners without seeming hypocritical because they engage in extramarital sexual relations themselves. Others feel uncomfortable discussing sexual matters with their students, and some believe that, due to their limited training, they are not knowledgeable enough about HIV/AIDS to direct classroom discussions about the disease. In addition, many teachers feel unsupported by community members, who often either deny {{the extent of the}} epidemic or believe that HIV/AIDS should not be addressed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b>|$|E
