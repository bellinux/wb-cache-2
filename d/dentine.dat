5|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying <b>dentine</b> cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Mysticetes have large whalebone, as opposed to teeth, made of keratin. Mysticetes have two blowholes, whereas Odontocetes contain only one.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians usually swallow food whole but may chew {{it lightly}} first to subdue it. They {{typically}} have small hinged pedicellate teeth, a feature unique to amphibians. The base and crown {{of these are}} composed of <b>dentine</b> separated by an uncalcified layer and they are replaced at intervals. Salamanders, caecilians and some frogs {{have one or two}} rows of teeth in both jaws, but some frogs (Rana spp.) lack teeth in the lower jaw, and toads (Bufo spp.) have no teeth. In many amphibians there are also vomerine teeth attached to a facial bone in the roof of the mouth.|$|E
5|$|In {{the upper}} incisors, the chewing edges are located behind the {{vertical}} {{plane of the}} incisors; thus, they are opisthodont. The microstructure of the enamel of the lower incisor was reported in a 2005 study. The inner portion (portio interna, PI) is much thicker than the outer portion (portio externa, PE). The PI consists of Hunter-Schreger bands, which are uniserial (consisting of a single enamel prism), as in all myomorph rodents. The PE consists of radial enamel, with flattened prisms that are almost parallel to the junction between the enamel and the <b>dentine.</b> The microstructure {{is similar to that}} of Holochilus brasiliensis and displays several characters seen only in Myomorpha.|$|E
5|$|Isotope {{analysis}} of the remains revealed that while the bones had δ13C values that were typical of those found at many other southern British Neolithic sites, they had significantly higher values of δ15N, which grew over time. Although this data is difficult to interpret, the investigative team believed that it probably reflected that these individuals had had a terrestrial diet high in animal protein that over time was increasingly supplemented with freshwater river or estuarine foods. In {{the case of the}} older individuals whose remains were interned in the tomb, the tooth enamel was worn away and the <b>dentine</b> had become exposed on the chewing area of the crowns.|$|E
5|$|Lavanify had high-crowned, curved teeth. One of the {{two teeth}} is 11.2mm high and shows a deep furrow and, is {{centered}} laterally in the crown, a V-shaped area that consists of <b>dentine.</b> The other, damaged, tooth is 9.8mm high and {{has at least one}} deep cavity (infundibulum). Characters shared by the teeth of Lavanify and Bharattherium include the presence of an infundibulum and a furrow; they both also have large, continuous bands of matrix (unbundled hydroxyapatite crystals) between the prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) of the enamel, and perikymata—wave-like ridges and grooves in the enamel surface.|$|E
5|$|The large incisor is {{inclined}} forward, and its rootthe {{only part of}} the tooth that is preservedforms an angle of about 55° with the horizontal. At the tip of the alveolus, where the tooth projects out of the bone, it is 3.0mm (0.12 in) high and 2.1mm broad. The root extends through the dentary to a position below the third cheektooth. Only the roots of the first and second cheekteeth are preserved. Both are about 1.5mm in diameter, but the first tooth may have been slightly smaller than the second. The third tooth, the largest of the cheekteeth, has the root slightly curved backward. This root is deeply anchored in the dentary, extending down through about three-fourths of the bone. The crown is preserved {{in the form of a}} stump of <b>dentine,</b> 2.3mm (0.091 in) long and 1.9mm (0.075 in) broad, that extends high above the dentary, indicating that the tooth was hypsodont (high-crowned). High <b>dentine</b> stumps also remain of the fourth and fifth cheekteeth. The fourth is about as large as the first and second and the fifth is smaller, with a diameter of about 1.0mm (0.039 in). The fourth cheektooth also has a long, curved root, which extends more than halfway through the dentary, and that of the fifth tooth is even smaller and shorter. The orientation of the roots and teeth indicates that all the teeth were single-rooted.|$|E
5|$|Odontocetes possess {{teeth with}} {{cementum}} cells overlying <b>dentine</b> cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of}} the tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Porpoises, like other odontocetes, possess only one blowhole. Breathing involves expelling stale air from the blowhole, forming an upward, steamy spout, followed by inhaling fresh air into the lungs. All porpoises have a thick layer of blubber. This blubber can help with insulation from the harsh underwater climate, protection to some extent as predators {{would have a hard time}} getting through a thick layer of fat, and energy for leaner times. Calves are born with only a thin layer of blubber, but some species compensate for this with a covering of fine, downy hair known as lanugo.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinguishing}} {{feature of the}} rodents is their pairs of continuously growing, razor-sharp incisors. These incisors have thick layers of enamel {{on the front and}} little enamel on the back. Because they do not stop growing, the animal must continue to wear them down so that they do not reach and pierce the skull. As the incisors grind against each other, the softer <b>dentine</b> on the rear of the teeth wears away, leaving the sharp enamel edge shaped like the blade of a chisel. Most species have up to 22 teeth with no canines or anterior premolars. A gap, or diastema, occurs between the incisors and the cheek teeth in most species. This allows rodents to suck in their cheeks or lips to shield their mouth and throat from wood shavings and other inedible material, discarding this waste from the sides of their mouths. Chinchillas and guinea pigs have a high-fiber diet; their molars have no roots and grow continuously like their incisors.|$|E
5|$|UA8653, the holotype, is hypsodont and curved. It is 11.2mm high, {{of which}} the crown makes up about 85%, and the {{dimensions}} of its crown are 3.4 x 3.2mm. The occlusal (chewing) surface is worn flat and contains a V-shaped island of <b>dentine</b> surrounded by enamel. One side of the crown lacks enamel. Between the two arms of the V, at the lingual (inner) side of the tooth, is a furrow filled with cementum, which extends {{all the way through}} the tooth; the presence of such a long furrow distinguishes it from Gondwanatherium. The enamel is made up of small, round prisms (bundles of hydroxyapatite crystals) that are separated by large, continuous bands of interprismatic matrix (IPM; the material between the enamel prisms).|$|E
5|$|In their {{original}} description, Krause and colleagues suggested that Lavanify was most {{closely related to}} the then-unnamed Indian sudamericid. They based this proposed relationship on the shared presence of prominent, continuous bands of IPM. The teams who named the Indian gondwanathere in 2007 both agreed with this proposed relationship. In their description of Dakshina, Wilson and colleagues added the presence of an infundibulum and of perikymata to the evidence for the relationship between the two. These three characters are synapomorphies (shared derived traits) for the Bharattherium-Lavanify clade. They also share the presence of furrows on the lingual side of the teeth only, but whether this is a derived feature is uncertain. Wilson and colleagues list two autapomorphies (unique derived traits) of Lavanify: presence of a V-shaped <b>dentine</b> island and absence of enamel {{on one side of the}} crown. Prasad and colleagues who named Bharattherium, noted the absence of enamel on part of the crown of a Bharattherium tooth and interpreted this trait as a synapomorphy of Bharattherium and Lavanify. They also mentioned the presence of a furrow and infundibulum as shared traits.|$|E
25|$|The organic part of <b>dentine,</b> conversely, is {{destroyed}} by alkalis.|$|E
25|$|Because {{teeth are}} very resistant, often {{preserved}} when bones are not, and reflect the diet {{of the host}} organism, they are very valuable to archaeologists and palaeontologists. Early fish such as the thelodonts had scales composed of <b>dentine</b> and an enamel-like compound, suggesting that the origin of teeth was from scales which were retained in the mouth. Fish {{as early as the}} late Cambrian had <b>dentine</b> in their exoskeleton, which may have functioned in defense or for sensing their environment. <b>Dentine</b> can be as hard as the rest of teeth and is composed of collagen fibres, reinforced with hydroxyapatite.|$|E
25|$|All {{amphibians}} have pedicellate teeth {{which are}} modified {{to be flexible}} due to connective tissue and uncalcified <b>dentine</b> that separates the crown {{from the base of}} the tooth.|$|E
25|$|In around 2006, {{two teams}} {{attempted}} to extract DNA from a tooth discovered in 2003, but both teams were unsuccessful. It {{has been suggested}} that this happened because the <b>dentine</b> was targeted; new research suggests that the cementum has higher concentrations of DNA. Moreover, the heat generated by the high speed of the drill bit may have denatured the DNA.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} species produce exoskeletons, which {{are composed of}} a range of materials. Bone, cartilage, or <b>dentine</b> is used in the Ostracoderm fish and turtles. Chitin forms the exoskeleton in arthropods including insects, arachnids such as spiders, crustaceans such as crabs and lobsters, and in some fungi and bacteria. Calcium carbonates constitute the shells of molluscs, brachiopods, and some tube-building polychaete worms. Silica forms the exoskeleton in the microscopic diatoms and radiolaria. One species of mollusc, the scaly-foot gastropod, even makes use of the iron sulfides greigite and pyrite.|$|E
25|$|Teeth (singular tooth) {{are small}} whitish {{structures}} {{found in the}} jaws (or mouths) of many vertebrates {{that are used to}} tear, scrape, milk and chew food. Teeth are not made of bone, but rather of tissues of varying density and hardness, such as enamel, <b>dentine</b> and cementum. Human teeth have a blood and nerve supply which enables proprioception. This is the ability of sensation when chewing, for example if we were to bite into something too hard for our teeth, such as a chipped plate mixed in food, our teeth send a message to our brain and we realise that it cannot be chewed, so we stop trying.|$|E
25|$|Many Ordovician, Silurian, and Devonian agnathians were {{armoured}} {{with heavy}} bony-spiky plates. The first armoured agnathans—the Ostracoderms, precursors to the bony fish and hence to the tetrapods (including humans)—are {{known from the}} middle Ordovician, and by the Late Silurian the agnathans had reached {{the high point of}} their evolution. Most of the ostracoderms, such as thelodonts, osteostracans, and galeaspids, were more closely related to the gnathostomes than to the surviving agnathans, known as cyclostomes. Cyclostomes apparently split from other agnathans before the evolution of <b>dentine</b> and bone, which are present in many fossil agnathans, including conodonts. Agnathans declined in the Devonian and never recovered.|$|E
25|$|Ichthyosaur {{teeth are}} {{typically}} conical. Fish-eating species have long and slender tooth crowns that are slightly recurved. Forms specialised in catching larger prey have shorter, broader, and straighter teeth; sometimes, cutting edges are present. Thalattoarchon, an apex predator, had larger teeth formed like flattened blades. Durophagous species, that ate shellfish, have low, convex teeth that are closely packed. Many ichthyosaur dentitions are heterodont, combining several tooth shapes, e.g. small {{teeth in the}} front and larger teeth at the rear. The teeth are usually placed in tooth sockets; derived species possess a common tooth groove. In the latter case, adult individuals sometimes become toothless. Teeth in tooth sockets sometimes fuse with the jawbone. With ichthyosaur teeth, the <b>dentine</b> shows prominent vertical wrinkles. Durophagous forms have teeth with deep vertical grooves and wrinkles in the enamel.|$|E
25|$|Preliminary {{investigations}} {{suggested a}} beluga's life expectancy was rarely more than 30 years. The method {{used to calculate}} the age of a beluga is based on counting the layers of dentin and dental cement in a specimen's teeth, which were originally thought to be deposited once or twice a year. The layers can be readily identified as one layer consists of opaque dense material and the other is transparent and less dense. It is therefore possible to estimate the age of the individual by extrapolating the number of layers identified and the estimated frequency with which the deposits are laid down. A 2006 study using radiocarbon dating of the <b>dentine</b> layers showed the deposit of this material occurs with a lesser frequency (once per year) than was previously thought. The study therefore estimated belugas can live for 70 or 80 years.|$|E
25|$|Hybodonts are {{generally}} described and identified based on {{size and shape}} of teeth and fin spine fossils. Hybodonts are recognized as having teeth with a prominent cusp which is higher than lateral cusplets. Species of hybodonts are often determined based on their teeth fossils which {{are more likely to be}} preserved the rock record than the remainder of the sharks’ skeleton. Teeth are abundant in the fossil record because sharks shed them throughout their lifetime and teeth are resistant to erosion. Hybodont teeth are often preserved as incomplete fossils because the base of the tooth is not well attached to the crown. Hybodonts were initially divided into two groups based on their tooth shape. One group had teeth with acuminate cusps that lacked a pulp cavity; these are called osteodont teeth. The other group had a different cusp arrangement and had a pulp cavity, these are called orthodont teeth. For example, the hybodont species Heterophychodus steinmanni have osteodont teeth with vascular canals of <b>dentine</b> which are arranged vertically parallel to each other, also called ‘tubular dentine’. The crowns of these osteodont teeth are covered with a single layer of enameloid.|$|E
500|$|The {{anatomic}} {{crown of}} a tooth {{is the area}} covered in enamel above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) or [...] "neck" [...] of the tooth. Most of the crown is composed of dentin (<b>dentine</b> in British English) with the pulp chamber inside. The crown is within bone before eruption. After eruption, it is almost always visible. The anatomic root is found below the CEJ and is covered with cementum. As with the crown, dentin composes most of the root, which normally has pulp canals. A tooth may have multiple roots or just one root (single-rooted teeth). Canines and most premolars, except for maxillary first premolars, usually have one root. Maxillary first premolars and mandibular molars usually have two roots. Maxillary molars usually have three roots. Additional roots {{are referred to as}} supernumerary roots.|$|E
500|$|The sperm whale's {{lower jaw}} is very narrow and underslung. The sperm whale has 18 to 26 teeth {{on each side}} of its lower jaw which fit into sockets in the upper jaw. The teeth are {{cone-shaped}} and weigh up to [...] each. The teeth are functional, but {{do not appear to be}} necessary for capturing or eating squid, as well-fed animals have been found without teeth or even with deformed jaws. One hypothesis is that the teeth are used in aggression between males. Mature males often show scars which seem to be caused by the teeth. Rudimentary teeth are also present in the upper jaw, but these rarely emerge into the mouth. Analyzing the teeth is the preferred method for determining a whale's age. [...] Like the age-rings in a tree, the teeth build distinct layers of cementum and <b>dentine</b> as they grow.|$|E
500|$|The tusks of an {{elephant}} are modified incisors {{in the upper}} jaw. They replace deciduous milk teeth when the animal reaches 6–12 months of age and grow continuously at about [...] a year. A newly developed tusk has a smooth enamel cap that eventually wears off. The <b>dentine</b> is known as ivory and its cross-section consists of crisscrossing line patterns, known as [...] "engine turning", which create diamond-shaped areas. As a piece of living tissue, a tusk is relatively soft; it is as hard as the mineral calcite. Much of the incisor can be seen externally while the rest is fastened to a socket in the skull. At least one-third of the tusk contains the pulp and some have nerves stretching to the tip. Thus {{it would be difficult}} to remove it without harming the animal. When removed, ivory begins to dry up and crack if not kept cool and moist. Tusks serve multiple purposes. They are used for digging for water, salt, and roots; debarking or marking trees; and for moving trees and branches when clearing a path. When fighting, they are used to attack and defend, and to protect the trunk.|$|E
500|$|Woolly mammoths {{had four}} {{functional}} molar teeth at a time, {{two in the}} upper jaw and two in the lower. About [...] of the crown was within the jaw, and [...] was above. The crown was continually pushed forwards and up as it wore down, comparable to a conveyor belt. The teeth had up to 26 separated ridges of enamel, which were themselves covered in [...] "prisms" [...] that were directed towards the chewing surface. These were quite wear resistant and kept together by cementum and <b>dentine.</b> A mammoth had six sets of molars throughout a lifetime, which were replaced five times, though a few specimens with a seventh set are known. The latter condition could extend the lifespan of the individual, unless the tooth consisted {{of only a few}} plates. The first molars were about the size of those of a human, , the third were 15cm (6in) [...] long, and the sixth were about [...] long and weighed [...] The molars grew larger and contained more ridges with each replacement. The woolly mammoth is considered to have had the most complex molars of any elephant.|$|E
2500|$|Decalcification {{removes the}} enamel from teeth and leaves only the organic {{interior}} intact, which comprises <b>dentine</b> and cementine. Enamel is quickly decalcified in acids, perhaps by dissolution by plant acids or via diagenetic solutions, {{or in the}} stomachs of vertebrate predators. Enamel can be lost by abrasion or spalling, and is lost before <b>dentine</b> or bone are destroyed by the fossilisation process. [...] In such a case, the 'skeleton' of the teeth would consist of the <b>dentine,</b> with a hollow pulp cavity.|$|E
2500|$|Tetracycline, an antibiotic, {{should never}} be {{prescribed}} to women in the reproductive age or children, because of its negative impact on bone mineralization and teeth mineralization. The [...] "tetracycline teeth" [...] have brown or grey colour {{as a result of}} a defective development of both the <b>dentine</b> and the enamel of teeth.|$|E
2500|$|Bone - {{being one}} of the most {{resistant}} materials to the process of fossilisation - often preserves internal detail, which allows the histology and growth of the scales to be studied in detail. The scales consist of a non-growing [...] "crown" [...] composed of <b>dentine,</b> with a sometimes-ornamented enameloid upper surface and an aspidine (acellular bony tissue) base. Its growing base is made of cell-free bone, which sometimes developed anchorage structures to fix it {{in the side of the}} fish. Beyond that, there appear to be five types of bone-growth, which may represent five natural groupings within the thelodonts - or a spectrum ranging between the end members, meta- (or ortho-) <b>dentine</b> and mesodentine tissues. Interestingly, each of the five scale morphs appears to resemble the scales of more derived groupings of fish, suggesting that thelodont groups may have been stem groups to succeeding clades of fish.|$|E
2500|$|Teeth are {{not always}} {{attached}} to the jaw, {{as they are in}} mammals. In many reptiles and fish, teeth are attached to the palate or {{to the floor of the}} mouth, forming additional rows inside those on the jaws proper. Some teleosts even have teeth in the pharynx. While not true teeth in the usual sense, the dermal denticles of sharks are almost identical in structure and are likely to have the same evolutionary origin. Indeed, teeth appear to have first evolved in sharks, and are not found in the more primitive jawless fish – while lampreys do have tooth-like structures on the tongue, these are in fact, composed of keratin, not of <b>dentine</b> or enamel, and bear no relationship to true teeth. Though [...] "modern" [...] teeth-like structures with <b>dentine</b> and enamel have been found in late conodonts, they are now supposed to have evolved independently of later vertebrates' teeth.|$|E
2500|$|Odontocetes, such as {{the sperm}} whale, possess teeth with {{cementum}} cells overlying <b>dentine</b> cells. Unlike human teeth, which are composed mostly of enamel on {{the portion of the}} tooth outside of the gum, whale teeth have cementum outside the gum. Only in larger whales, where the cementum is worn away on the tip of the tooth, does enamel show. Except for the sperm whale, most toothed whales are smaller than the baleen whales. [...] The teeth differ considerably among the species. They may be numerous, with some dolphins bearing over 100 teeth in their jaws. At the other extreme are the narwhals with their single long tusks and the almost toothless beaked whales with tusk-like teeth only in males.Not all species are believed to use their teeth for feeding. For instance, the sperm whale likely uses its teeth for aggression and showmanship.|$|E
6000|$|Experiment 4.--May 1st, {{a minute}} and thin bit of <b>dentine,</b> {{moistened}} with saliva, was placed on a leaf, which was soon inflected, and re-expanded on the 5th. The <b>dentine</b> had become as flexible as thin paper. It was then transferred to a fresh leaf, which next morning (6th) was strongly inflected, and reopened on the 10th. The decalcified <b>dentine</b> was now so tender that it was torn into shreds merely {{by the force of}} the re-expanding tentacles.] ...|$|E
6000|$|Experiment 3.--May 1st, {{fragment}} moistened with saliva {{and placed}} on a leaf, which remained well inflected until 5th, when it re-expanded. The enamel was not at all, and the <b>dentine</b> only slightly, softened. The fragment was now transferred to a fresh leaf, which next morning (6th) was strongly inflected, and remained so until the 11th. The enamel and <b>dentine</b> both now somewhat softened; and Dr. Klein reports, [...] "less than half the enamel, but {{the greater part of}} the <b>dentine</b> decalcified." ...|$|E
60|$|Section 3. The {{skin of the}} dog-fish {{is closely}} set with pointed tooth-like scales, the placoid scales, and these are {{continued}} over the lips into the mouth as teeth. Each scale consists of a base of true bone, with a little tubercle of a harder substance, <b>dentine,</b> capped by a still denser covering, the enamel. The enamel {{is derived from the}} outer layer of the embryonic dog-fish, the epiblast, which also gives rise to the epidermis; while the <b>dentine</b> and bony base arise in the underlying mesoblast, the dermis. A mammalian tooth has essentially the same structure: an outer coat of enamel, derived from epiblast, overlies a mass of <b>dentine,</b> resting on bone, but the <b>dentine</b> is excavated internally, to form a pulpcavity containing blood-vessels and nerves. Most land animals, however, have teeth only in their mouths, and have lost altogether the external teeth which constitute the armour of the dog-fish. Besides the teeth there perhaps remain relics of the placoid scales in the anatomy of the higher vertebrata, in the membrane bones. How placoid scales may have given rise to these structures will be understood by considering such a bone as the vomer of the frog. This bone lies {{on the roof of the}} frog's mouth, and bears a number of denticles, and altogether there is a very strong resemblance in it to a number of placoid scales the bony bases of which have become confluent. In the salamander, behind the teeth-bearing vomers comes a similar toothed parasphenoid bone. The same bone occurs in a corresponding position in the frog, but without teeth. In some tailed amphibians the vomers and splenials are known to arise by the fusion of small denticles. These facts seem to point to stages in the fusion of placoid bases, and their withdrawal from the surface to become incorporated with the cranial apparatus as membrane bones, a process entirely completed in the mammalian type.|$|E
60|$|From these {{experiments}} {{it appears that}} enamel is attacked by the secretion with more difficulty than <b>dentine,</b> as {{might have been expected}} from its extreme hardness; and both with more difficulty than ordinary bone. After the process of dissolution has once commenced, it is carried on with greater ease; this may be inferred from the leaves, to which the fragments were transferred, becoming in all four cases strongly inflected {{in the course of a}} single day; whereas the first set of leaves acted much less quickly and [page 108] energetically. The angles or projections of the fibrous basis of the enamel and <b>dentine</b> (except, perhaps, in No. 4, which could not be well observed) were not in the least rounded; and Dr. Klein remarks that their microscopical structure was not altered. But this could not have been expected, as the decalcification was not complete in the three specimens which were carefully examined.|$|E
6000|$|Experiment 2.--May 1st, {{fragment}} {{placed on}} leaf; 2nd, tentacles fairly well inflected, with much secretion on the disc, and remained so until the 7th, when the leaf re-expanded. The fragment was now {{transferred to a}} fresh leaf, which next day (8th) was inflected in the strongest manner, and thus remained until the 11th, when it re-expanded. Dr. Klein reports, [...] "a great deal of enamel and {{the greater part of}} the <b>dentine</b> decalcified." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [Experiment 1.--May 1st, {{fragment}} {{placed on}} leaf; 3rd, tentacles but little inflected, so a little saliva was added; 6th, as the tentacles were not strongly inflected, the fragment {{was transferred to}} another leaf, which acted at first slowly, but by the 9th closely embraced it. On the 11th this second leaf began to re-expand; the fragment was manifestly softened, and Dr. Klein reports, [...] "a great deal of enamel and {{the greater part of}} the <b>dentine</b> decalcified." ...|$|E
6000|$|Enamel and Dentine.--As the {{secretion}} decalcified ordinary bone, I {{determined to}} try {{whether it would}} act on enamel and <b>dentine,</b> but did not expect that it would succeed with so hard a substance as enamel. Dr. Klein gave me some thin transverse slices of the canine tooth of a dog; small angular fragments of which were placed on four leaves; and these were examined each succeeding day at the same hour. The results are, I think, worth giving in detail.] [page 107] ...|$|E
