40|$|Although dust-holding {{capacity}} {{is the primary}} feature of engine air filters operating in dusty environments, efficiency becomes a major factor when selecting an engine air filter. Inertial separators and high porosity or fibrous prefilters are commonly used to decrease the dust load to the main filter while high efficiency is achieved by utilizing submicron or nanofiber fibers in the main filter. The patented multi-stage filter was designed to achieve ultra-high particle removal efficiency and <b>dust</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> and long life in dusty and on highway environments. The main (final) filter is located downstream of the prefilter. The main filter is made of pleated filter media containing nanofibers with a diameter {{in the range of}} 40 – 800 nanometers. The upstream in-line precleaner utilizing flow-through mini cyclones has separation efficiency of 95 %. A high dust capacity, high efficiency prefilter can be used instead of the precleaner. The prefilter is made of vertically lapped nonwoven filter media made from synthetic fibers of different materials to fully utilize the tribological effect. The volume of the prefilter is determined by the performance required and space allotted. This paper discusses the filter performance of high <b>dust</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> engine air filters. Filter specifications, design and performance are discussed in detail.

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Fibrous filter materials are used to remove fine aerosol particles from gases at as low a pressure drop as possible, while achieving the desired quality of cleaned gas. High aerosol removal efficiency at low pressure drop can be achieved if the filter fibres carry an electric charge, allowing aerosol to be collected by additional electrostatic mechanisms. Unfortunately the efficiency of such materials is reduced as they are loaded with aerosol. Prefilter materials can also achieve very high efficiencies, but {{at the expense of}} greater pressure drop, and filter cakes, which have very high pressure drops, form on such materials at low aerosol particle loads. Producing a fibrous filter from both types of material, a composite, allows efficient aerosol collection at low pressure drop, and high <b>dust</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity.</b> This work reports on an experimental program studying the aerosol particle penetration through, and pressure drop across a mixed fibre type electrically active material, and a number of prefilter materials of differing packing density, as they are loaded with aerosol particles.

40|$|TutorialAir {{filtration}} plays a {{key role}} in achieving high availability and low maintenance cost for Gas Turbines, in particular in offshore applications. Offshore applications pose a particular challenge, since they have to provide protection both against liquid water ingestion (and the salt particles dissolved in this water), as well as against very small particles (dry salt and other dust). Two fundamentally different concepts have emerged: High velocity systems and low/medium velocity systems, distinguished by the face velocity of the air entering the filter elements. While high velocity systems rely on vanes to remove liquids from the airstream, modern low/medium velocity systems use special filtration materials (usually in the last, high efficiency stage) that prevent water from passing through the element. Older systems did not have this type of filters available. The tutorial will discuss the physical principles of these air filtration concepts. The paper discusses the issues of filtration efficiency, <b>dust</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity,</b> as well as the capability to prevent water from entering the gas turbine.

40|$|Air filter {{manufacturers}} have recently begun marketing premium air filters that provide very high particle capture efficiencies with very low initial static pressure drops. This is accomplished with proprietary filter designs incorporating {{at least twice}} the media surface area of traditional filters. 1 The increased media reduces the initial pressure drop of air filters while dramatically increasing their <b>dust</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity.</b> In addition, their useful lives are extended and prefilter use may be eliminated. Physical principals governing airflow in fan systems predict available energy savings from using premium air filters. This energy savings may offset the additional cost of the premium filters. In fact, premium filter investments can payback in six months to three years depending on airflow and number of hours of fan operation. Additional benefits of using premium air filters include longer filter life, lower installation and disposal costs, elimination of prefilters {{and the ability to}} increase effective filter efficiency in buildings without reducing ventilation effectiveness. A case study was conducted in an office building with two nearly identical VAV systems to determine if premium air filters are good investments for building owners and managers.

The {{first part}} compares the filtration performance of nanofiber (300 nm diameter fibers) and microfiber (1. 8 m diameter fibers) filters. Test aerosol is sodium chloride (NaCl) particulates ranging from 41 to 514 nm generated from atomization. Experimental {{results show that}} the fractional efficiency and quality factor of nanofiber filter is higher than microfiber filter, but microfiber filter has lower rate of increase in pressure drop under continuous loading. The second part aims to utilize the <b>dust</b> <b>holding</b> <b>capacity</b> of microfiber filter to relieve the rapid clogging and skin formation of nanofiber filter. In this work, three types of filters formed by stacking of microfiber and nanofiber layers are tested to investigate the loading characteristics of inhomogeneous dual-layer fibrous filter under the challenge of sub-micron NaCl aerosol. Experimental {{results show that the}} filter with microfiber layer upstream of nanofiber layer has a lower increase rate in pressure drop than the filter with constituent layers in reversed arrangement. The semi-empirical model of polydisperse aerosol loading, as modified from the version of monodisperse aerosol, predicts deposition profile across filter depth that explains the pressure drop results. Serving two purposes, the dual-layer filter with microfiber (upstream) and nanofiber (downstream) is able to utilize the strength of nanofibers in clean stage filtration and microfibers in loaded stage filtration. Moreover, a lower pressure drop increase implies that the filter does not require frequent cleaning by backpulses of compressed air, which might destroy the fragile nanofibers.
