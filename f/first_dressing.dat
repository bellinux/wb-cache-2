I hung this, and a flask of whisky, in a sling round my neck; and, after <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> myself in my confusion, thought better of it, and stripped, again, for swimming, to my shirt and drawers. By the time I had done that the hammering was over and there was such a silence that I could hear the water bubbling into the scuttled vessel amidships. The next noise was the noise of the boat and the villains in her (always excepting my friend, the mate) shoving off from the starboard side. I waited for the splash of the oars in the water, and then got my back under the hatch. The mate had kept his promise. I lifted it easily--crept across the deck, under cover of the bulwarks, on all fours--and slipped into the sea on the port side. Lots of things were floating about. I took the first thing I came to--a hen-coop--and swam away with it about a couple of hundred yards, keeping the yacht between me and the boat. Having got that distance, I was seized with a shivering fit, and I stopped (fearing the cramp next) to take a pull at my flask. When I had closed the flask again, I turned for a moment to look back, and saw the yacht in the act of sinking. In a minute more there was nothing between me and the boat but the pieces of wreck that had been purposely thrown out to float. The moon was shining; and, if they had had a glass in the boat, I believe they might have seen my head, though I carefully kept the hen-coop between me and them.|$|E

50|$|The <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> mill, {{where the}} blocks of slate were split and dressed to form roofing slates, was {{situated}} {{on the eastern shore}} of Llyn Cwmorthin, and was known as Lake Mill. A second mill, the Cross Mill, was built a little further down the valley, as a result of which water from Llyn Cwmorthin could be used to feed a water wheel, which powered the dressing machinery. Two rope-worked inclined planes allowed the tramway to negotiate the difference in level between the mill and the Ffestiniog Railway. The connection of the final incline to the railway was deemed to be dangerous by a Board of Trade inspector in 1864, as there were no trap points to prevent runaway wagons running onto the main line. As a result, the Ffestiniog Railway had to install distant signals and a telegraph connection to the winding house at the incline summit. Trains were not allowed to run along the main line while the incline was in use.|$|E

40|$|Postoperative {{pain from}} split skin donor sites {{is often more}} intense than the pain at the grafted site. In this prospective, randomized, {{double-blind}} study we assessed the efficacy of a continuous fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) in reducing the pain at the thigh donor site. Twenty patients, with a total burn surface area of 16 % +/- 13 % (mean +/- SD) were randomized 1 : 1 to receive either ropivacaine 0. 2 % or saline 0. 9 %. All patients received a general anesthesic followed by preincision continuous FICB with 40 mL of the randomized solution, then an infusion of 10 mL/h of either ropivacaine or saline until the <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change (72 It later). Postoperative analgesia consisted of propacetamol 2 g/ 6 h, IV patient-controlled analgesia of morphine chlorhydrate (2 mg/mL), and morphine hydrochlorate 0. 5 mg/kg PO once 60 min before <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change. The visual analog scale (VAS) scores were compared using the Mann-Whitney U-test preoperatively, 24 and 48 It postoperatively, and during the <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change. The cumulative morphine consumption was compared with repeated-measures analysis of variance followed by Scheffe's method if indicated. Patients with continuous FICB had significantly reduced postoperative morphine consumption at all time points (23 +/- 20 versus 88 +/- 29 mg after 72 It, study versus control groups, respectively; P < 0. 05). In both groups, VAS scores remained low but were only significantly lower for patients with continuous FICB during the <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change (3 [1] versus 7 [3]; median [interquartile range]; P < 0. 05). We conclude that continuous FICB is an efficient method for diminishing pain at the thigh donor site. (250 words) ...|$|E
30|$|To {{overcome}} these problems, in this study, undiluted fibrin sealant was applied {{directly to the}} wound, and skin grafting was performed directly. Not only is the surgical method simplified, but the total time needed is shortened. The disadvantage of fast-clotting fibrin sealant is the formation of clots before the graft adheres to the wound bed, preventing their use as glue. When fast-clotting fibrin sealant {{was used in this}} study, clots were formed before graft application, and weaker adhesion was noted compared with low-concentration sealant. Nevertheless, little graft dislocation was observed at the time of <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change at 5  days postoperatively, and little graft necrosis was observed 30  days postoperatively.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Acute {{intraoperative}} suprachoroidal haemorrhage (AISH) is {{the most}} sight-threatening complication of ocular surgery. We investigated the visual outcomes following this intraoperative event, patient characteristics that may predispose to it and the clinical features that may be of prognostic significance. METHODS: The records of 45 cases of AISH collected from ophthalmic centres in the United Kingdom, Republic of Ireland and Switzerland were reviewed. Two satisfactory controls in terms of operative procedure, surgeon, age (+/- 5 years) and gender were found for each of 33 of our cases. Systemic and ocular characteristics were compared for cases and controls, and the visual results of all cases of AISH are analysed. RESULTS: Cases and controls differed {{only in terms of}} axial length and pre-operative intraocular pressure, both of which were significantly greater for eyes that experienced an AISH (p < 0. 05). Ten eyes (22. 2 %) achieved a final Snellen acuity of 6 / 12 or better. Statistically significant associations with a final acuity of counting fingers or worse included spontaneous nuclear expression (p = 0. 02), retinal detachment (p < 0. 0001), four-quadrant suprachoroidal haemorrhage (p = 0. 007) and vision of perception of light or worse at the <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> (p = 0. 0001). Four of the 6 eyes that experienced an AISH during phacoemulsification surgery had a visual outcome of 6 / 12 or better, and this was significantly greater than for cases involving extracapsular cataract surgery (p = 0. 004). CONCLUSION: The results indicate that longer axial length and higher pre-operative intraocular pressure are associated with increased risk of AISH. Poor visual results are more likely following spontaneous nuclear expression, retinal detachment, four-quadrant suprachoroidal haemorrhage or vision of perception of light or worse at the <b>first</b> <b>dressing.</b> The results also suggest that AISH complicating a phacoemulsification procedure has a more favourable visual prognosis than AISH that occurs during extracapsular cataract surgery...|$|E
30|$|The {{experiment}} {{was laid out}} in a split-plot design with three replications for each field (Figure  3). All fields were divided into two parts to produce two strips to separate fertilized and non-fertilized parts. Two sets of factors included in this experiment were as follows: with (+F) and without (-F) fertilizer application as the main plot, and different positions as a subplot. The positions were the inlet, middle and outlet for the two fields, referred to as the 1 st inlet, 1 st middle, 1 st outlet for the 1 st field, and the 2 nd inlet, 2 nd middle and 2 nd outlet for the 2 nd field. The applied chemical fertilizers were Nitrogen (N) 50 kg ha- 1 (Ammonium sulfate), Phosphorus (P) 30 kg ha- 1 (Triple superphosphate) and Potassium (K) 20 kg ha- 1 (Muriate of potash) with two split applications according to the local recommendations by extension service. The <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> was conducted at transplanting using 50 % N, 100 % P and 100 % K of the total amount of fertilized applied. The second dressing contained the remaining 50 % N which was applied at heading stage (60 days after transplanting).|$|E
40|$|The {{original}} publication {{is available}} at www. springerlink. comPURPOSE: Perianal sepsis is traditionally treated by incision and drainage, with packing of the residual cavity until healing. This {{study was designed to}} show that perianal abscess may be safely treated by incision and drainage alone. METHODS: Healing times, analgesic requirements, pain scores, abscess recurrence, and fistula rates were compared between two randomized groups treated with and without packing of perianal abscess cavities. RESULTS: Fifty patients were recruited (7 lost to follow-up) : 20 in the packing and 23 in the nonpacking arm. The groups were comparable in terms of age and gender distribution, type and size of abscess, and the presence of a fistula at operation. Mean healing times were similar (P = 0. 214). The rate of abscess recurrence was similar (P = 0. 61). Postoperative fistula rates were similar (P = 0. 38). Pain scores at the <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change were similar (P = 0. 296). Although pain scores appeared much reduced in the nonpacking arm, this did not attain statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study indicates that perianal abscesses can be managed safely without continued packing of the cavity without any obvious complications. Darren M.

40|$|Background and objectives: Platelets are {{a source}} of {{numerous}} growth factors which facilitate repair and healing. Thus platelet rich plasma has been increasingly used as a treatment modality in the field of reconstructive surgeries for wound healing. This preliminary study was carried out to explore whether platelet growth factors from platelet rich plasma could be used for enhancement of split thickness skin graft survival. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients (13 males and 7 females) requiring split thickness skin graft for various clinical reasons were enrolled in the study. Platelet rich plasma was collected by apheresis and frozen at − 80 ° C. It was thawed at room temperature immediately before its intended application. PRP was applied only on one half of the wound, while another half served as control. Patient was followed for 6 weeks. The effect was assessed at <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> in terms of graft uptake and subsequently as time taken for complete healing. Results: There was 100 % uptake of the graft in the area where platelet rich plasma was applied. In the control area, there was complete graft loss in 4 cases, partial loss in 7 cases and complete uptake in 9 cases. Conclusion: This study demonstrated promising results on application of PRP to split thickness skin grafts. Further randomized studies with greater sample size may be undertaken to establish platelet rich plasma as a validated treatment modality...|$|E
40|$|Background and Aim: Superinfection of burn wounds is a {{major cause}} of {{mortality}} and morbidity in hospital burn units. It is crucial for every burn center to determine the pattern of microbial colonization in burn wounds and the antimicrobial sensitivity profiles. This study was carried out on patients admitted to the Burn Unit of Emam Reza University Hospital, Mashhad, with the aim of verifying the pattern of microbial colonization of burn sites and determining the antimicrobial sensitivity of the isolated bacterial species. Materials and Methods: In this study a total of 344 samples were obtained from 126 burn patients. After isolation and identification of bacteria, we used an agar diffusion method to determine sensitivity against 14 common antibiotics. Results: Our results showed that 27. 7 % of the wounds were sterile {{at the time of the}} <b>first</b> <b>dressing,</b> but the rate of contamination increased with time so that only 5 % of wounds were sterile by the third week; Pseudomonas aeroginosa was the most frequently isolated species (31. 7 %). Most of bacteria were resistant to amoxicillin; ciprofloxacin and imipenem emerged as the most effective antibiotics. Conclusion: The common occurrence of gram-negative bacilli and staphylococci together with the sensitivity patterns show that we are far from eradication of wound infections, so there is an urgent need for improved infection control practices and policies...|$|E
40|$|An open {{randomised}} prospectively controlled {{trial was}} performed to assess the healing efficacy, slippage rate and degree of discomfort on removal of calcium alginate and a silicone-coated polyamide net dressing on split skin graft donor sites. Sixteen patients were randomised to the calcium alginate group and 14 to the silicone-coated group. The donor sites were assessed at days 7, 10, 14 and up to day 21. The mean time to healing in the calcium alginate group was 8. 75 +/- 0. 78 days (range 7 to 14 days) compared to 12 +/- 0. 62 days (range 7 to 16 days) for the silicone-coated group (p < 0. 01). Although more silicone-coated dressings slipped (5 versus 1), {{the difference was not}} statistically significant. Pain during the <b>first</b> <b>dressing</b> change was assessed using a visual analogue pain scale. Although {{no significant differences were found}} between the groups, it was necessary to change the dressing protocol in the silicone-coated arm of the trial after entering the first two patients. Overlaid absorbent gauze adhered to the donor site through the fenestrations in the dressing necessitating the placement of paraffin gauze between the experimental dressing and the overlying cotton gauze. There was one infection in the study, occurring in the alginate group. Based on these results we recommend calcium alginate as the dressing of choice for split skin graft donor sites...|$|E
