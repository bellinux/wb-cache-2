5|$|Jackson edited unused {{material}} from the Division Bell sessions, described by Mason as ambient music, into an hour-long composition tentatively titled The Big Spliff, but Pink Floyd decided not to release <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> of The Big Spliff was used to create the band's final album, The Endless River (2014).|$|E
5|$|Like {{some other}} {{grassland}} psilocybin mushroom {{species such as}} P.mexicana, P.tampanensis and Conocybe cyanopus, P.semilanceata may form sclerotia, a dormant form of the fungus, which affords <b>it</b> <b>some</b> protection from wildfires and other natural disasters. The German mycologist Jochen Gartz even succeeded in producing sclerotia on a malt agar surface culture.|$|E
5|$|At 23:30, Fleet and Lee {{noticed a}} slight haze {{on the horizon}} ahead of them, but did not make {{anything}} of <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> experts now believe that this haze was actually a mirage caused by cold waters meeting warm air (similar to a water mirage in the desert) when Titanic entered Iceberg Alley. This {{would have resulted in}} a raised horizon, blinding the lookouts from spotting anything far away.|$|E
25|$|Michael Palmer's poetry has {{received}} both praise and criticism over the years. <b>Some</b> reviewers call <b>it</b> abstract. <b>Some</b> call <b>it</b> intimate. <b>Some</b> call <b>it</b> allusive. <b>Some</b> call <b>it</b> personal. <b>Some</b> call <b>it</b> political.

5|$|DST is {{generally}} not observed near the equator, where sunrise times do not vary enough to justify <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> countries observe it only in some regions; for example, southern Brazil observes it while equatorial Brazil does not.

5|$|Dionne Warwick first {{performed}} (but never recorded) {{the song}} in February 1983 on a TV special {{as a tribute to}} many performers, including Janis Joplin, Elvis Presley, John Belushi, Cass Elliot, John Lennon, Bobby Darin, Minnie Riperton, Sam Cooke, Harry Chapin, Buddy Holly, Otis Redding, Jimi Hendrix, Jim Croce, Bobby Van and Karen Carpenter who had died days earlier. Later on the same day, Jackson called Kohan explaining he had wept while watching the performance and that he felt he wanted to record <b>it</b> <b>some</b> day.|$|E
5|$|Football {{was played}} in Leek {{from at least}} 1876, with an earlier side called simply Leek F.C. having been part of The Combination in the 1890s, but the current Leek Town club traces its lineage to the {{formation}} of a team called Leek Lowe Hamil in 1946 (although the club's official history does not mention <b>it,</b> <b>some</b> sources state that the club was initially known as Abbey Green Rovers before adopting the Lowe Hamil name).|$|E

5|$|On 9 February 2014, Swiss voters {{narrowly}} {{approved by}} 50.3% a ballot initiative {{launched by the}} national conservative Swiss People's Party (SVP/UDC) to restrict immigration, and thus reintroducing a quota system on the influx of foreigners. This initiative was mostly backed by rural (57.6% approvals) and suburban agglomerations (51.2% approvals), and isolated towns (51.3% approvals) of Switzerland {{as well as by}} a strong majority (69.2% approval) in the canton of Ticino, while metropolitan centres (58.5% rejection) and the French-speaking part (58.5% rejection) of Switzerland rather rejected <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> news commentators claim that this proposal de facto contradicts the bilateral agreements on the free movement of persons from these respective countries.|$|E
5|$|The 10th Regimental {{headquarters}} {{remained at}} Fort Gibson until March 31, 1869, {{when they moved}} to Camp Wichita, Indian Territory (now the state of Oklahoma). They arrived on April 12, 1869. Camp Wichita was an old Indian village inhabited by the Wichita tribe on the Anadarko Reservation. General Sheridan had selected a site nearby for a military post and Carpenter {{with the rest of}} the 10th Cavalry was ordered there to establish and build <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> time in the following month of August, the post was given the name of Fort Sill. Civil War Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill was a classmate and friend of Sheridan who was killed in action in 1862.|$|E

5|$|The West Pier Trust {{now owns}} the pier and has {{proposed}} various plans to renovate <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> schemes have been opposed by local residents {{and the owners}} of the nearby Palace Pier, who have claimed unfair competition. The pier gradually collapsed during the early 21st century. Major sections collapsed in late 2002, and two fires in March and May 2003 left little of the original structure. Subsequently, English Heritage declared it to be beyond repair. Structured demolition took place in 2010 {{to make way for the}} observation tower i360; further structural damage from storms has occurred since.|$|E
5|$|The {{reasons for}} {{piercing}} or not piercing are varied. Some people pierce for religious or spiritual reasons, while others pierce for self-expression, for aesthetic value, for sexual pleasure, {{to conform to}} their culture or to rebel against <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> forms of piercing remain controversial, particularly when applied to youth. The display or placement of piercings have been restricted by schools, employers and religious groups. In spite of the controversy, some people have practiced extreme forms of body piercing, with Guinness bestowing World Records on individuals with hundreds and even thousands of permanent and temporary piercings.|$|E
5|$|There are no {{respiratory}} organs, {{and both}} cell layers absorb oxygen from and expel carbon dioxide {{into the surrounding}} water. When {{the water in the}} digestive cavity becomes stale it must be replaced, and nutrients that have not been absorbed will be expelled with <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> Anthozoa have ciliated grooves on their tentacles, allowing them to pump water out of and into the digestive cavity without opening the mouth. This improves respiration after feeding and allows these animals, which use the cavity as a hydrostatic skeleton, to control the water pressure in the cavity without expelling undigested food.|$|E

5|$|Thin {{film with}} diffuse reflector, {{based on the}} top two layers of a buttercup's petals. The {{brilliant}} yellow gloss derives from a combination, rare among plants, of yellow pigment and structural coloration. The very smooth upper epidermis acts as a reflective and iridescent thin film; for example, in Ranunculus acris, the layer is 2.7 micrometres thick. The unusual starch cells form a diffuse but strong reflector, enhancing the flower's brilliance. The curved petals form a paraboloidal dish which directs the sun's heat to the reproductive parts at {{the centre of the}} flower, keeping <b>it</b> <b>some</b> degrees Celsius above the ambient temperature.|$|E
5|$|This strong odour can be {{detected}} {{half a mile away}} by animals, thus luring them. In addition, the fruit is extremely appetising to a variety of animals, including squirrels, mouse deer, pigs, orangutan, elephants, and even carnivorous tigers. While some of these animals eat the fruit and dispose of the seed under the parent plant, others swallow the seed with the fruit and then transport <b>it</b> <b>some</b> distance before excreting, with the seed being dispersed as a result. The thorny, armoured covering of the fruit discourages smaller animals; larger animals are more likely to transport the seeds far from the parent tree.|$|E

5|$|At about 3:30am on Thursday, 25 February, Gothenburg {{continued}} to heel over. The deck became so steep that {{passengers and crew}} had to climb over the rails to get on her side. At about 4:00am, the two remaining starboard lifeboats were lowered and were rushed by the passengers. One starboard lifeboat, crammed with women and children, capsized when others tried to board <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> half dozen men righted her in the water, but, damaged and without oars, food or water, it quickly drifted away and was never found. The second starboard lifeboat also capsized when the sea crashed over, washing all the occupants into the sea. One passenger recalled the sea on the downwind {{side of the ship}} being covered with human heads bobbing up and down like corks. Five or six men and one woman climbed onto the upturned hull. The boat was still connected to its painter, but it was unable to be recovered from the heavy sea and wind which swept the woman off and drowned her. A passenger, John Cleland, swam to the connected, but upturned lifeboat and further secured it with a rope tied to Gothenburg. In less than fifteen minutes, nearly 100 people had drowned; washed away or trapped in their water-filled cabins. By this time, several sharks were circling the wreck.|$|E
5|$|Butterflies are {{threatened}} {{in their early}} stages by parasitoids and in all stages by predators, diseases and environmental factors. Braconid and other parasitic wasps lay their eggs in lepidopteran eggs or larvae and the wasps' parasitoid larvae devour their hosts, usually pupating inside or outside the desiccated husk. Most wasps are very specific about their host species and some {{have been used as}} biological controls of pest butterflies like the large white butterfly. When the small cabbage white was accidentally introduced to New Zealand, it had no natural enemies. In order to control <b>it,</b> <b>some</b> pupae that had been parasitised by a chalcid wasp were imported, and natural control was thus regained. Some flies lay their eggs on the outside of caterpillars and the newly hatched fly larvae bore their way through the skin and feed in a similar way to the parasitoid wasp larvae. Predators of butterflies include ants, spiders, wasps, and birds.|$|E
5|$|For example, (using {{the first}} formula (1) for {{absolute}} maximum breathing time), a diver {{at a depth}} of 15 meters in water with an average density of 1020kg/m³ (typical seawater), who breathes at a rate of 20 litres per minute, using a dive cylinder of 18 litres pressurized at 200 bars, can breathe for a period of 72 minutes before the cylinder pressure falls so low as to prevent inhalation. In some open circuit scuba systems this can happen quite suddenly, from a normal breath to the next abnormal breath, a breath which may not be fully drawn. (There is never any difficulty exhaling). The suddenness of this effect depends on the design of the regulator and the internal volume of the cylinder. In such circumstances there remains air under pressure in the cylinder, but the diver is unable to breathe <b>it.</b> <b>Some</b> of it can be breathed if the diver ascends, as the ambient pressure is reduced, and even without ascent, in some systems a bit of air from the cylinder is available to inflate buoyancy compensator devices (BCDs) even after it no longer has pressure enough to open the demand valve.|$|E
