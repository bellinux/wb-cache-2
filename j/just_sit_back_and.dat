She commended Padukone's looks, although she criticized aspects of her stagecraft skills. Sukanya Verma of Rediff.com gave the film 2.5 stars, saying, [...] "Chennai Express evokes a few laughs but otherwise it decides to shift tracks from droll comedy to dreadful drama." [...] Khalid Mohamed of Deccan Chronicle gave the film 2.5 stars and wrote, [...] "board Chennai Express at your own risk". Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave the film 2/5 rating and said the film was a [...] "big, fat" [...] bore. He commented that Chennai Express was a [...] "bloated vanity project", and felt that the lead actor could have performed better. Mayank Shekhar of Dainik Bhaskar rated it 1 star out of 5, saying, [...] "You've paid for the ticket? Yes. Now <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> suffer." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{successful}} on track, the Mercedes team {{got into}} a discussion with Formula One chief executive Bernie Ecclestone over the TV coverage time their drivers received during the Grand Prix. Over the ninety-minute race, Mercedes cars were visible for only six minutes, leading to their non-executive chairman Niki Lauda saying: [...] "I was watching TV all day long, and funny enough I saw Saubers {{and a lot of}} Honda cars, but I don't know why [...] Somebody must do the filming here. I have to ask what's wrong with him. I want to see Bernie next week and ask him what is the reason." [...] Speaking about hitting the pit bollard at his stop, Carlos Sainz Jr. said it had been a [...] "rookie error" [...] due to his urgency to overtake Pastor Maldonado during the pit stops. Daniil Kvyat, who finished 13th after starting in the pit lane complained about the race, saying: [...] "It was pretty boring for me out there this afternoon because a combination of circumstances meant I had to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> was unable to attack. [...] In the end, I did manage to overtake some people, but it wasn't great. It's frustrating and annoying, but there was nothing I could do." ...|$|E

50|$|Frank {{could be}} {{considered}} a foil to Esme, since he is rather easy going and doesn’t complain or get worked up easily. This contrasts greatly with Esme's strong emotional response to almost anything. Although she may remain cool, you can see that she is analyzing and calculating {{to take control of the}} situation. Frank <b>just</b> <b>sits</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> watches the action - often missing something in the conversation, or at least pretending to be uninvolved. Frank could also be considered the buffoon, since he creates an additional obstacle between Amy and Esme by screwing up Esme's finances.|$|R
2500|$|The subject {{material}} for Game Theory follows {{the more serious}} tone of the album, with topics ranging {{from the war in}} Iraq to violence in music. Questlove was quoted as saying [...] "There was too much going on that we couldn’t <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> not speak on it." [...] In accordance with its more-serious tone, the album heavily references Public Enemy's highly-political It Takes a Nation of Millions to Hold Us Back on its lead track [...] "False Media".|$|E
2500|$|Among French philosophers, Vincent Descombes {{argues that}} Deleuze's {{account of a}} {{difference}} that is not derived from identity (in Nietzsche and Philosophy) is incoherent, and that his analysis of history in Anti-Oedipus is 'utter idealism', criticizing reality for falling short of a non-existent ideal of schizophrenic becoming. [...] According to Pascal Engel, Deleuze's metaphilosophical approach {{makes it impossible to}} reasonably disagree with a philosophical system, and so destroys meaning, truth, and philosophy itself. Engel summarizes Deleuze's metaphilosophy thus: [...] "When faced with a beautiful philosophical concept you should <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> admire it. You should not question it." [...] Alain Badiou claims that Deleuze's metaphysics only apparently embraces plurality and diversity, remaining at bottom monist. Badiou further argues that, in practical matters, Deleuze's monism entails an ascetic, aristocratic fatalism akin to ancient Stoicism.|$|E
2500|$|Colter {{explained}} that in Luke Cage, {{the character is}} [...] "trying to basically stay off the radar", but an event in the series' second episode, described as [...] "hard to watch", [...] "get this series into forward action mode ... There were events that needed to happen to make [...] see that he couldn’t <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> do nothing." [...] Coker said the arc for Cage in the season was [...] "hero", [...] "How does one become a hero? What does one feel about being a hero? How does one live their life and eventually go through the [...] until the acceptance is fine, I’m a hero?" [...] He felt this was a natural way of introducing the character, rather than the more traditional origin story of other Marvel properties, and differentiated the show {{from the rest of}} the MCU. Coker had plotted the story of the first four episodes before the show's writers room began work, but had initially done so over two or three episodes, with the event at the end of the second episode originally taking place at the end of the first. Loeb and Marvel's Karim Zreik told Coker to [...] "slow it down a little bit", which led to an approach that Coker compared to Unforgiven where [...] "you keep building little moments of what Luke can do but he hasn’t really engaged yet." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1934 {{the chief}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Admiral Ernest King, offered Halsey command of the {{aircraft}} carrier , subject to completion of the course of an air observer. Captain Halsey elected to enroll as a cadet for the full 12-week Naval Aviator course rather than the simpler Naval Aviation Observer program. [...] "I thought it better to be able to fly the aircraft itself than to <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> be {{at the mercy of the}} pilot." [...] Halsey earned his Naval Aviator's Wings on May 15, 1935, at the age of 52, the oldest person to do so in the history of the U.S. Navy. While he had approval from his wife to train as an observer, she learned from a letter after the fact that he had changed to pilot training, and she told her daughter, [...] "What do you think that the old fool is doing now? He's learning to fly!" [...] He went on to command the Saratoga, and later the Naval Air Station Pensacola at Pensacola, Florida. Halsey considered airpower an important part of the future navy, commenting, [...] "The naval officer in the next war had better know his aviation, and good." [...] Captain Halsey was promoted to rear admiral in 1938. During this time he commanded carrier divisions and served as the overall commander of the Aircraft Battle Force.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{staff writer}} Steve Huey gave the album {{four and a}} half out of five stars, saying, [...] "The album's {{strength}} is its mournful, elegiac ballads, but thanks to the band's spontaneous creative energy and appropriately warm sound, it's permeated by a definite, life-affirming aura." [...] Rolling Stone staff writer David Fricke gave Temple of the Dog four out of five stars, saying, [...] "For [...] "Hunger Strike" [...] and [...] "Reach Down" [...] alone, Temple of the Dog deserves immortality; those songs are proof that the angst that defined Seattle rock in the 1990s was not cheap sentiment, at least in the beginning. And you can't help but love the irony of an album, made in great sadness, kick-starting the last great pop mutiny of the twentieth century." [...] David Browne of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a B+. Browne said, [...] "Maybe because the musicians avoid the often-labored anthems they play with their own bands, the songs sound relaxed and airy without losing any of the crunch or drive of the best arena rock." [...] He ended by stating, [...] "Singer Chris Cornell's lyrics remain as annoyingly oblique as they are with Soundgarden, but don't worry. <b>Just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> revel in the whomping guitars of Mike McCready and Love Bone member Stone Gossard as they mesh with the imaginative pummeling of Soundgarden drummer Matt Cameron—the untamed side of the much-hyped Seattle sound, in all its wailing glory." ...|$|E

5000|$|A {{review for}} the second season of Hetalia, also in NEO, by Matt Kamen gave the DVD of the season four stars, each for {{the program and the}} DVD extras. Kamen wrote that [...] "Despite its risqué jokes and {{abundance}} of national stereotypes, Hetalia thankfully manages to stay on just the right side of casual comedy racism — maybe that's why we don't feel too bad laughing uproariously at the dub, particularly Japan's heavy 'Engrish' accent! It's best not to ask too many questions of this show — instead, <b>just</b> <b>sit</b> <b>back</b> <b>and</b> enjoy while Hetalia conquers your world".|$|E

5000|$|From The Brass Herald (May 2009, by Philip Biggs) Tom Brantley ... is a {{musician}} who transcends technique and the practical considerations that most mortals {{have to deal}} with.

A playful yet serious blending of genres makes TMO an un-intimidating way to expose oneself to classical and traditional jazz blended with elements of rock.
