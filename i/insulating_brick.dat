This experimental analysis extends further the previous studies {{of the benefits of}} thermal mass on the overall thermal performance of building enclosures (Gregory et al. 2008, Luo at al. 2008, Alashaary et al. 2009). The comparison is based on the time required to maintain thermal comfort for free-floating internal conditions. The results clearly show that internal comfort levels are influenced by both the thermal resistance of the walls as well as the extent and location of the thermal mass, with neither parameter being the sole predictor. The best thermal performance is therefore obtained by an appropriate combination of thermal mass and resistance, rather than focussing on the overall wall thermal resistance (R-value) alone. A new approach of density temperature plots for comparison of temperature variation is also used in the assessment of module thermal performance...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This study {{examined}} the feasibility of utilizing lignite bottom ash as a partial substitute for ball clay in an <b>insulating</b> <b>brick</b> composition. Lignite bottom ash is a waste byproduct that is high in alumina and silicates and is therefore a candidate material for replacing aluminosilicate minerals such as clay. The lignite bottom ash powder {{was obtained from the}} Mae Moh power plant, Thailand. Small brick specimens were produced by die pressing a mixture of lignite bottom ash, ball clay and aluminum hydroxide. The composition of the mixture contained a fixed amount of aluminum hydroxide, while the lignite bottom ash replaced from 30 to 70 % of the ball clay. The pressed samples were sintered at 1300 ºC for 1 hour in air. The density, porosity, strength and thermal properties of the samples were measured. A microstructural analysis of the sintered brick was also performed. It was found that the porosity of the samples increased from 35 to 45 % with increased lignite bottom ash content. The modulus of rupture and the thermal conductivity of the bricks were reduced with increased lignite bottom ash content, likely due to the increased amount of porosity. Dilatometric analysis found that the thermal expansion increased with increased amounts of lignite bottom ash, possibly {{as a result of an}} increased amount of glassy phase.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{concept of}} {{durability}} for buildings was until recently mainly {{limited to the}} reduction of energy consumption during the use phase, in particular for heating requirements. Because of the constant improvement of the thermal performances of the envelopes, {{the share of the}} environmental impacts due to building materials takes an increasingly significant share. In this study the environmental impact assessment of three construction systems (wood frame, thermal <b>insulating</b> <b>brick</b> and concrete block with a peripheral insulation) has been established and analysed. The results of the assessment show that energy requirements for the use phase of the building are more significant than for the manufacturing of building materials. On the contrary the environmental impacts of building materials are bigger than those of the energy resources for heating and production of hot water. It comes out from this study that there are no very significant differences for the environmental impact assessment between the three considered construction systems. Each system shows advantages and disadvantages. The share of steel as well as the nature and the quantity of insulation material are the main causes of variations between the construction systems.

40|$|The {{design of}} low energy {{buildings}} requires accurate thermal simulation software {{to assess the}} heating and cooling loads. Such designs should sustain thermal comfort for occupants and promote less energy usage over the life time of any building. One of the house energy rating used in Australia is AccuRate, star rating tool to assess and compare the thermal performance of various buildings where the heating and cooling loads are calculated based on fixed operational temperatures between 20 °C to 25 °C to sustain thermal comfort for the occupants. However, these fixed settings for the time and temperatures considerably increase the heating and cooling loads. On the other hand the adaptive thermal model applies {{a broader range of}} weather conditions, interacts with the occupants and promotes low energy solutions to maintain thermal comfort. This can be achieved by natural ventilation (opening window/doors), suitable clothes, shading and low energy heating/cooling solutions for the occupied spaces (rooms). These activities will save significant amount of operating energy what can {{to be taken into account}} to predict energy consumption for a building. Most of the buildings thermal assessment tools depend on energy-based approaches to predict the thermal performance of any building e. g. AccuRate in Australia. This approach encourages the use of energy to maintain thermal comfort.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a novel concept called the 'Dynamic Thermal Response' (DTR) {{which accounts for}} {{the contribution of the}} masonry components of walling systems in buildings when exposed to typical temperature fluctuations. The concept is of particular importance for masonry construction as it directly reflects the contribution and appropriate arrangement of the insulation and thermal mass within each wall. The concept can also be expanded to capture the overall thermal performance of building enclosures (termed the 'DTRS'). The current worldwide emphasis in the assessment of the thermal performance of buildings is to use static thermal conditions, with the thermal resistance (R-value) of the various building components being the principal parameter considered. None of the existing methods consider the location of the insulation in relation to the high thermal mass components of the walls, despite this being an important parameter. This importance is illustrated by the comparative behaviour of <b>insulated</b> <b>brick</b> veneer and <b>insulated</b> reverse <b>brick</b> veneer walling systems, which can have the same steadystate R-value but significantly different thermal performance. The DTR concept takes into account the dynamic nature of the environmental conditions, the response of the wall to environmental changes and more importantly, facilitates the assessment of the thermal performance of the building as a whole (using the DTRS as a direct extension of the concept). The principles of the concept and the fact that masonry construction significantly reduces heating and cooling loads have been confirmed using data obtained from observations of the thermal performance of existing lightweight and heavy walling housing test modules. The concept has the potential to improve the accuracy and effectiveness of current energy efficiency measures and ultimately lead to more thermally efficient house designs as well as the assessment of the performance of retrofitting techniques for existing housing...|$|R
