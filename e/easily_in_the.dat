5|$|The {{transformation}} of age-old customs, commerce and administration to the Swedish model {{could not be}} effected quickly or <b>easily.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first fifty years of the transition, {{the treatment of the}} population was quite harsh. Denmark made several attempts to recapture the territories, the last in 1710, but ultimately conceded the territories as lost.|$|E
5|$|Storylines often {{centred on}} new signings who {{were unable to}} settle <b>easily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Melchester team, either because they refused to change their style of play and {{expected}} the Rovers to play around them, such as the uncomprisingly tough defender Duncan McKay, or had personal characteristics that {{made it difficult for}} the other players to accept them, such as ex-circus ball juggler Sammy Spangler. As the average reader probably stayed with the comic for only three or four years, many storylines were recycled. For instance, during the first ten years of his playing career Roy was kidnapped at least five times.|$|E
5|$|Two {{days after}} her defeat in the Derby, La Fleche ran against fillies in the Oaks. Although some {{regarded}} her as a certainty, her odds drifted from 2/5 to 8/11 before the start. In the race she tracked the leader Broad Corrie before taking {{the lead in the}} straight apparently poised for an easy victory. In the final furlong however, she was closely pressed by The Smew, a filly she had dealt with <b>easily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1000 Guineas, and Barrett had to ride a vigorous finish to win the race by a short head. On 29 July at Goodwood, La Fleche won the Nassau Stakes in which, despite looking less than fully fit, she quickened impressively to bear Broad Corrie by a length and a half.|$|E

5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more <b>easily.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with its beak and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|In {{another study}} that {{appeared}} in the British Journal of Psychology, researchers tested how respondents considered balance in artwork composition of differing qualities. Fifteen pairs of works from ArtCyclopedia by artists such as Paul Gauguin, Georgia O'Keeffe, and Georges-Pierre Seurat, and fifteen from MOBA by artists including Doug Caderette, Unknown, and D. Alix were shown to participants; in each, an item in the painting was shifted vertically or horizontally, and respondents were asked to identify the original. The researchers hypothesized that respondents would identify balance and composition more <b>easily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> traditional masterworks, and that study participants would find a greater change of quality when items were shifted in traditional masterworks than they would in MOBA pieces. However, the study concluded that balance alone did not define art of higher quality for the participants, and that respondents were more likely to see that original art was more balanced than the altered version, not necessarily that the traditional art was significantly better composed and balanced than MOBA works.|$|E
5|$|The Australians seized {{their good}} fortune and set their fastest time to date with 11.0seconds (s). Having been beaten twice after leading out, the Australians sat back before {{sweeping}} past the Germans and Americans {{in the final}} lap. Australia were again drawn against South Africa in their quarter-final, who had defeated them <b>easily</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> heats. This time they equalled the fastest team in the competition over the final 200m, clocking 10.8s to progress to the final, where they faced the Italy. Giuseppe Ogna and Cesare Pinarello {{appeared to be in}} control {{at the start of the}} final lap. They had moved alongside the Australians with one and a half laps to go, but the Australians surprised them at the start of the final lap. The Italians came back to pull level at the start of the back straight, but the Australians held them off and pulled away to win by a length and a half. The Italians lodged a protest for interference but it was dismissed. The Australians finished in a time of 10.8s and Browne later claimed that he was convinced by the performance that they would win the gold medal.|$|E

This is in spite of tensions caused by Mexico's annexation of the Soconusco region in the 19thcentury. The border between Mexico and Guatemala had been traditionally poorly guarded, due to diplomatic considerations, lack of resources and pressure from landowners who need cheap labor sources.|$|E
