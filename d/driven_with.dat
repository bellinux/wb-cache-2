5|$|When Prince Alfred {{arrives in}} the kingdom and {{falls in love with}} Snow White, Elspeth is furious to {{discover}} that images of Snow White are appearing in her mirrors, which means that her stepdaughter is the fairest of them all. <b>Driven</b> <b>with</b> jealousy, Elspeth orders Hector, a hunter, to take Snow White into the forest and kill her, and then return with Snow White's heart for her to consume. In the meantime, Elspeth transforms Alfred into a bear. Unable to kill Snow White, Hector presents Elspeth with the heart of a wild boar instead. When she learns the truth, Elspeth kills Hector, imprisons John in her mirrors, and stifles Snow White with an enchanted ribbon.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the failure}} of surpassing the Huracán Performante, the team {{was still able to}} make the Viper ACR the fastest American, rear-wheel <b>driven</b> (<b>with</b> no {{additional}} assistance), and manual transmission car to go around the track. Their lap time also brought the car to sixth position for street legal vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Impedance {{extends the}} concept of {{resistance}} to AC circuits, and possesses both magnitude and phase, unlike resistance, which has only magnitude. When a circuit is <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> direct current (DC), there is no distinction between impedance and resistance; the latter {{can be thought of}} as impedance with zero phase angle.|$|E
25|$|In the 1943 serial film Batman, a black 1939 Cadillac Series 61 {{convertible}} {{was used}} by Bruce Wayne and Dick Grayson, {{as well as their}} secret identities Batman and Robin. (It was <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> the top down as Bruce and Dick, and with the top up when they were in disguise.) Alfred chauffeured the Dynamic Duo in both identities.|$|E

25|$|In the West, {{the most}} common {{materials}} for the equipment have been wood and metal. Wooden hoops, <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> a stick about one foot long, are struck with the centre or the 2/3 point of the stick {{in order to ensure}} good progress. Metal hoops, instead of being struck, are often guided by a metal hook.|$|E
25|$|The Frisky Family Three was {{basically}} a three-wheeled version of the coupe fitted with a smaller Villiers 9E engine and MacPherson strut front suspension. Having three wheels instead of four meant the car qualified for lower vehicle excise duty and also meant {{that it could be}} <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> a motorcycle licence. It entered production in about February 1959.|$|E
25|$|Initial phase: {{the bulb}} is <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> {{controlled}} overload. Because the arc is operated at high power, {{the temperature in}} the capsule rises quickly. The metallic salts vaporize, and the arc is intensified and made spectrally more complete. The resistance between the electrodes also falls; the electronic ballast control gear registers this and automatically switches to continuous operation.|$|E

25|$|In {{the mid-19th}} century, bent ash was favoured as {{material}} for making wooden hoops. In early 20th-century England, girls {{played with a}} wooden hoop <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> a wooden stick, while boys' hoops were made of metal and the sticks were key-shaped and also made of metal. In some locations, hoops with spokes and bells were available in stores, but they were often disdained by boys.|$|E
25|$|The world's largest {{mechanical}} planetarium {{is located}} in Monico, Wisconsin. The Kovac Planetarium. It is 22 feet in diameter and weighs two tons. The globe is made of wood and is <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> a variable speed motor controller. This is the largest mechanical planetarium in the world, larger than the Atwood Globe in Chicago (15 feet in diameter) and one third {{the size of the}} Hayden.|$|E
25|$|The {{doors are}} {{unique in that}} they retract vertically, instead of {{traditional}} designs which swing outward or upward (the first car with retractable doors was the 1954 Kaiser Darrin, although these doors slid forwards not downwards). The body with its high sills, offers crash protection independent of the doors, {{and it is possible}} (although perhaps not legal in some countries) for the Z1 to be <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> the doors lowered.|$|E

25|$|Hoops, {{also called}} krikoi, were {{probably}} made of bronze, iron, or copper, and were <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> a stick called the elater. The hoop was sized {{according to the}} player, as it {{had to come up}} {{to the level of the}} chest. Greek vases generally show the elater as a short, straight stick. The sport was regarded as healthful, and was recommended by Hippocrates for strengthening weak constitutions. Even very young children would play with hoops.|$|E
25|$|Computers: The {{on-board}} equipment centered around a 2-of-3 computer system. The original LZB 80 design used 8085 microprocessors programmed in assembly language. The programs were interrupt <b>driven,</b> <b>with</b> interrupts {{generated by a}} 70 ms clock, the track receivers and transmitters, the serial interface, and also within the program itself. Interrupts triggered comparison and output programs. Peripheral equipment was arranged around the computers with all interfaces electrically separated and all grounds tied to the cabinet frame which was tied to the vehicle chassis.|$|E
25|$|A {{rail spike}} is roughly chisel-shaped {{and with a}} flat edged point; the spike is <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> the edge {{perpendicular}} to the grain, which gives greater resistance to loosening. The main function {{is to keep the}} rail in gauge. When attaching tie plates the attachment is made as strong as possible, whereas when attaching a rail to tie or tie plate the spike is not normally required to provide a strong vertical force, allowing the rail some freedom of movement.|$|E

25|$|The Loyal Legion...undercut the IWW quite effectively. In {{the summer}} of 1917, the IWW {{appeared}} to control an entire industry, {{but by the end}} of the war, the IWW was not only suppressed, it had been dispersed and absorbed.... In the minds of all but the most dedicated Wobblies the ferocious ideas of the class struggle evaporated in the atmosphere of patriotism, the eight-hour day, and palpable improvements of living conditions. The Wobblies of hard revolutionary substance had to be <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> the club rather than led by the carrot.|$|E
25|$|A {{keypunch}} is {{a device}} for manually entering data into punched cards by precisely punching holes at locations {{designated by the}} keys struck by the operator. Early keypunches were manual devices. Later keypunches were mechanized, often resembling a small desk, with a keyboard similar to a typewriter, and with hoppers for blank cards and stackers for punched cards. In 1901, Herman Hollerith invented and patented the mechanical key punch that was operated by keys, like a typewriter, and that advanced the card automatically to the next column after each punch. Later models would be motor <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> rudimentary programming features.|$|E
25|$|The {{opening of}} the valley road as far as Täsch in 1971 {{resulted}} in a new focus of passenger volumes. Since then, many tourists have <b>driven</b> <b>with</b> their own cars to Täsch, {{where they have to}} change to the trains of the BVZ, as the road to Zermatt remains closed to car traffic to this day, and can only be used with special permission. To cope with the additional passenger numbers from Täsch, a commuter service was introduced in May 1972 between Täsch and Zermatt. This service has since transported around two thirds of all passengers arriving in Zermatt.|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Development of a {{brushless}} valve electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> {{a minimum}} apparatus excess for an autonomous floating vehicle. Methodology. The construction of models of an automated electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a contactless DC motor {{and the subsequent}} technical implementation of such automated electric drive under various control methods are possible using coordinate transformations of differential equations describing the electric motor under the assumed assumptions. Results. The analysis of {{the current state of}} an automated electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a brushless DC motor in a special technique is carried out, possible directions for the improvement of automated electric drives are determined. A simple technical solution of an automated electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a brushless DC motor was proposed and its mathematical model for an electric drive of an automatic floating vehicle with improved technical and economic parameters was developed. Model of an automated electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a brushless DC motor are carried out. Originality. A simple technical solution for the construction of an automated electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a brushless DC motor is proposed, which excludes the use of intermediate computation of coordinates and an expensive encoder. Practical value. Model of the proposed scheme of an automated electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a minimum hardware redundancy, which confirmed the operability of the proposed solution, were carried out. Analysis of the dynamic and static characteristics of the proposed scheme of an automated asynchronous electric <b>drive</b> <b>with</b> a brushless DC motor with a simplified rotor position sensor has made it possible to determine the maximum speed control range with an allowable level of its pulsations...|$|R
