5|$|The Ethics Commission later granted his {{campaign}} a reprieve, allowing Wolf {{to make an}} appeal at their next scheduled meeting on September 19. At the meeting, the Commission ruled 4-1 to reverse its decision which disqualified him from public office, allowing him {{to remain in office}} and renew his candidacy Governor. On October 21, Wolf announced he was ending {{his campaign}} for governor, due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though the Ethics Commission voted to change its rules, the implementation would have likely taken several months. On June 17, 2014, Wolf endorsed Don Berwick as the Democratic nominee for governor.|$|E
5|$|The {{agricultural}} sector continued to perform poorly and by Brezhnev's final year, food shortages were reaching disturbing levels of frequency. Particularly embarrassing {{to the regime}} was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> bread had become rationed, one commodity that they always prided themselves on being available. One reason for this was excessive consumer demand as food prices remained artificially low while incomes had trebled over the last 20 years. Despite the miserable failure of collective farming, the Soviet government remained committed to reducing imports of foodstuffs from the West even though they cost less than domestic production, not only for reasons of national pride, but {{out of fear of}} becoming dependent on capitalist countries for basic necessities.|$|E
25|$|In the {{introduction}} Obadiah {{says that he}} was induced to write his work by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> so great a man as Maimonides had expressed the opinion that all the theories of Aristotle concerning the sublunary world are absolutely correct. Obadiah himself translated the Or Ammim into Latin {{and sent it to}} Henry II of France. It has been published in 1548.|$|E

25|$|Although no {{photographs}} of Paganini {{are known to}} exist, in 1900 Italian violin maker Giuseppe Fiorini forged the now famous fake daguerreotype of the celebrated violinist. So well in <b>fact,</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the great classical author and conversationalist Arthur M. Abell was led to {{believe it to be}} true, reprinting the image in the 22 January 1901 issue of the Musical Courier.|$|E
25|$|A fourth {{phase of}} post-approval {{surveillance}} is also often required {{due to the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the largest clinical trials cannot effectively predict the prevalence of rare side-effects. Postmarketing surveillance ensures that after marketing {{the safety of a}} drug is monitored closely. In certain instances, its indication may need to be limited to particular patient groups, and in others the substance is withdrawn from the market completely.|$|E
25|$|The poem {{allows the}} reader to {{experience}} this, her dying wish, in a very personal and powerful way as she entreats us to come in close {{and listen to what}} she has to say like a loved one and a confidence. Yet the reader is struck by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> as we read her final request, we know it goes un-honored. This has a further social implication on the silencing of marginalized cultures and, additionally, women.|$|E

25|$|However, he did {{not support}} any kind of {{regional}} administration within Hungary based on the nationality principle. Kossuth accepted some national demands of the Romanians and the Croats, but he showed no understanding for the requests of the Slovaks. Despite his father's Slovak origin, he considered himself Hungarian and {{went so far as}} to reject the very notion of a Slovak nation in the Kingdom of Hungary, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> his uncle György Kossuth supported the Slovak national movement.|$|E
25|$|South Ossetia's {{climate is}} {{affected}} by subtropical influences from the East and Mediterranean influences from the West. The Greater Caucasus range moderates the local climate by serving as a barrier against cold air from the North, which results in the <b>fact</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> at great heights, it is warmer there than in the Northern Caucasus. Climatic zones in South Ossetia are determined by distance from the Black Sea and by altitude. The plains of eastern Georgia are shielded from {{the influence of the}} Black Sea by mountains that provide a more continental climate.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in March 1964, Radio Caroline was {{the first}} in what became an {{eventual}} fleet of 10 offshore pirate radio stations that began to ring the British coastline, mostly along the South East coast. By 1966 millions were tuning into these commercial operations, and the BBC was rapidly losing its radio listening audience. This was largely due to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though they were fully aware of the problem, the BBC still only played a few hours of Pop music from record a week, as opposed to the pirates who broadcast chart music and new releases all day.|$|E
50|$|The {{large number}} of {{extensions}} and lack of agreement on a standard library, together with the language popularity and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> not <b>even</b> the Unix compilers precisely implemented the K&R specification, led to the necessity of standardization.|$|R

5000|$|For {{many years}} historians {{have pointed to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> an <b>even</b> longer, more explicit, version of the film played in Japanese and European cinemas in 1958. Efforts to locate the legendary [...] "Japanese version" [...] of Dracula had been fruitless.|$|R
25|$|A Fistful of Dollars was {{at first}} {{intended}} by Leone to reinvent the western genre in Italy. In his opinion, the American westerns of the mid- to late-1950s had become stagnant, overly preachy and not believable. Despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Hollywood began to gear down production of such films, Leone {{knew that there was}} still a significant market in Europe for westerns. He observed that Italian audiences laughed at the stock conventions of both American westerns and the pastiche work of Italian directors working behind pseudonyms. His approach was to take the grammar of Italian film and to transpose it into a western setting.|$|E
25|$|These studies {{point to}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though we only attend to and process limited information, we have {{a vast amount of}} {{knowledge}} at our disposal through our highly unrestricted sensory registers. It is the selective attention, perception, and higher order cognitive processing that limits these inputs and it is precisely these processes that make up our conscious awareness. Thus, in order to formulate some explanations for Plato's Problem, our conscious awareness limits our experience; nevertheless, it seems as though some stimuli that are sensed by our sensory registers, although seemingly rejected by conscious awareness, are actually retained and abstracted into our memories for further processing. All of our fully functioning perceptual faculties enhance, supplement, and optimize our experiences.|$|E
25|$|One {{particular}} case that highlighted {{the lack of}} uniqueness in bite marks involved two suspects accused of attacking a man that had sustained a bite mark injury. Two separate forensic dentists, one representing the prosecution and one the defense, were brought in to analyze the mark. They reported conflicting results. One found the mark to come from suspect A and the other said it was from suspect B. This disagreement resulted from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though the two suspects had dental features making them unique, the bite mark itself was not detailed enough to reflect them. Therefore, the mark could have reasonably come from either of the men. The equivocal outcome demonstrated in the case emphasizes the difficulty in proving uniqueness.|$|E

5000|$|Every even perfect {{number is}} a pernicious number. This {{is based on}} the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> every <b>even</b> perfect number can be {{represented}} as 2p−1(2p − 1) with p a prime. Owing to this form, every even perfect number is represented in binary as p ones followed by p &minus; 1 zeros.|$|R
5000|$|Blame it on Vaasthu Dhosham, Kaala Dhosham or {{any other}} aspect, the <b>fact</b> is <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> Chilkur Balaji Temple ran into {{problems}} {{and was on the}} verge of being closed.

25|$|Kūkai himself left {{writings}} {{that make}} it clear he saw no problem in a mixed institution like the jingū-ji. There, Buddhist clergy would routinely recite sūtras {{on behalf of a}} kami, to guide him or her to satori. The institution had the government's approval and was meant on one side to be a tool to spread Buddhism to the provinces, on the other as a way to install religious representatives of the government there. During the Heian period a great number of temples were built next to shrines, but the term jingū-ji itself tended to disappear, suggesting that temples were taking over control of the shrines. How pervasive was Buddhism can be inferred from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Ise Shrine, a place considered even today the holiest of Shinto shrines, in 1868 included almost 300 Buddhist temples and practiced Buddhism. This in spite of strict rules which forbade Buddhism within the shrine itself.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the causes}} of the defeat was that General József Nagysándor, who had the task to cross the Vág at Szered in order to hold the Austrian units there, did not {{observed}} that these enemy units left that place and joined Wohlgemuth's main troops, to support the attack in the main front. He remained on his position, despite the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Görgei ordered him to cross the now undefended Vág river, and attack from side and behind the enemy troops, which could have brought the victory to Hungarians. Do to the inactivity of Nagysándor the numerically much superior Austro-Russian troops managed to chase the Hungarian troops from the positions they occupied the day before. Görgei had no choice that to order the Hungarian retreat. He sent Leiningen a messenger with the order to continue its retreat, crossing the Vág river, but he held Királyrév for a while, until the units of lieutenant-colonel Rakovszky which were pursuing the enemy troops chased out of the village turned back. Until this happened, Colonel Kászonyi, with the cavalry battery of the II. corps attacked the enemy troops which were moving towards Királyrév. After all detached troops arrived, Görgei ordered the retreat of the II. corps too, towards the bridge of Aszódpuszta.|$|E

25|$|Although now {{regarded}} as a cult film, Sorcerer was not received as well by the public or film critics as Friedkin's previous two films had been. American movie reviewer D. K.

50|$|Uniqueness of PDVU {{lay in the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> it <b>even</b> {{before its}} Constituent Congress had its {{parliamentary}} factions: among the Constituent Congress delegates there were 18 members of the Supreme Council of Ukraine.

5000|$|After he had {{finished}} high school, Ernst started with high expectations and enthusiasm to study chemistry at the famous Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich (ETH Zurich). But he was disappointed {{by the state of}} chemistry in the early 1950s as it was taught at ETH Zurich; the students had to memorize uncountable <b>facts</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the professors did not understand. The physical chemistry lectures did not reveal much insight either, they were limited just to classical thermodynamics. So, Ernst had to return to reading {{in order to get the}} knowledge he wanted. He often read the book [...] "Textbook of Physical Chemistry [...] " [...] by S. Glasstone. In it he learned about the fundamentals of quantum mechanics, spectroscopy, statistical mechanics, and statistical thermodynamics.|$|R
500|$|Religious writer Michel Clasquin {{said the}} episode also {{demonstrates}} {{the ease with}} which people blend their religious convictions with lessons from pop culture, particularly with Stan's confusion of a Star Trek quote with a lesson from Jesus Christ. Additionally, Clasquin said the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Priest Maxi recognizes Jesus as [...] "that guy from the public access show" [...] demonstrates that even the supposedly most religious people are not always the most open to genuine religious experiences. Clasquin also said elements of the Crucifixion of Jesus are alluded to in the boxing match with Satan.|$|E
500|$|In June 2007, Governor T. V. Rajeswar {{said that}} there was {{insufficient}} evidence to prosecute her.

[...] Advocates unsuccessfully challenged the governor's decision in court. The Supreme Court rejected the plea of the CBI and refused to direct the governor to prosecute her. The Taj corridor case was effectively ended before going to trial.|$|E
500|$|Eric Walters of Paste awarded The Flash episode a 9.0 out of 10, stating, [...] ""Flash vs. Arrow" [...] was {{everything}} a fan could have wanted from a crossover event," [...] noting it was [...] "tight, well-paced, superbly written and, most importantly, fun...". Caroline Preece of Den of Geek also praised the episode, {{saying that it}} [...] "was pretty much everything fans wanted and more". She noted this episode demonstrated how comic book ideas [...] "can translate to the small screen if done with this much care, joy and enthusiasm". Given the [...] "hype" [...] she admired, and was [...] "surprised" [...] by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> [...] "with a little added Oliver, Felicity and Diggle thrown in," [...] the crossover was not {{the focus of the}} whole episode.|$|E
