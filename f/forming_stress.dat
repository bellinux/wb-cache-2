The results show that drawing stress decreases and elongation rate increases {{with the increase of}} grain size, the concentrated force area of cylinder-shaped part is transferred from the area punch fillet to die fillet area. Twin grain ratio and twinning degree near the punch fillet are increasing. Twin grain distribution becomes uneven with the increase of grain size.

40|$|Abstract. Applying {{the metal}} forming for the {{production}} of machine parts from the composites in the aluminum alloy matrix will allow to widen the range of the practical application in this group of materials. In order to reach such results not only the reinforcement with ceramic particles into the matrix should be inserted but also the basic metal forming parameters of created composites must be set and verified. The article shows the results of plastometric research carried on the composites with AW-AlCu 2 SiMn alloy matrix. The research was conducted on the turning plastometer possessed by the Faculty of Mechanical Engineering of the Silesian Technology University. On the basis of the results the yielding curves were set in the system <b>forming</b> <b>stress</b> σ – true deformation ε. Good coating in the AW-AlCu 2 SiMn-SiC system causes limitation of the ability to deformation {{as a result of the}} separating boarder destruction and leads to destruction of the composite at the much lower deformation value and ductile stress.

40|$|Using a one-layer QG model, {{we study}} {{the effect of}} random monoscale {{topography}} on forced beta-plane turbulence. The forcing is a uniform steady wind stress that produces both a uniform large-scale zonal flow U(t) and smaller-scale macroturbulence (both standing and transient eddies). The flow U(t) is retarded by Ekman drag and by the domain-averaged topographic <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> produced by the eddies. The topographic <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> typically balances most of the applied wind stress, while the Ekman drag provides all of the energy dissipation required to balance the wind work. A collection of statistically equilibrated solutions delineates the main flow regimes and the dependence of the time-mean U on the problem parameters and the statistical properties of the topography. If β is smaller than the topographic PV gradient then the flow consists of stagnant pools attached to pockets of closed geostrophic contours. The stagnant dead zones are bordered by jets and the flow through the domain is concentrated into a narrow channel of open geostrophic contours. If β is comparable to, or larger than, the topographic PV gradient then all geostrophic contours are open and the flow is uniformly distributed throughout the domain. In this case there is an "eddy saturation" regime in which U is insensitive {{to changes in the}} wind stress. We show that eddy saturation requires strong transient eddies that act as PV diffusion. This PV diffusion does not alter the energy of the standing eddies, but it does increase the topographic <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> by enhancing the correlation between topographic slope and the standing-eddy pressure field. Last, using bounds based on the energy and enstrophy we show that as the wind stress increases the flow transitions from a regime in which <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> balances the wind stress to a regime in which the <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> is very small and large transport ensues.

40|$|The {{regulation}} of translation and mRNA degradation in eukaryotic cells involves {{the formation of}} cytoplasmic mRNP granules referred to as P-bodies and stress granules. The yeast Pbp 1 protein and its mammalian ortholog, Ataxin- 2, localize to stress granules and promote their formation. In Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Pbp 1 also interacts with the Pab 1, Lsm 12, Pbp 4, and Dhh 1 proteins. In this work, we determined whether these Pbp 1 interacting proteins also accumulated in stress granules and/or could affect their formation. These experiments revealed the following observations. First, the Lsm 12, Pbp 4, and Dhh 1 proteins all accumulate in stress granules, whereas only the Dhh 1 protein is a constitutive P-body component. Second, deletion or over-expression of the Pbp 4 and Lsm 12 proteins did not dramatically affect the formation of stress granules or P-bodies. In contrast, Pbp 1 and Dhh 1 over-expression inhibits cell growth, and for Dhh 1, leads to the accumulation of stress granules. Finally, a strain lacking the Pab 1 protein was reduced at <b>forming</b> <b>stress</b> granules, although they could still be detected. This indicates that Pab 1 affects, but is not absolutely required for, stress granule formation.

40|$|The {{manufacturing}} process of glass fibers {{used for the}} reinforcement of composite material consists in drawing a glass melt at high temperature through the bushing plate into fibers using a winder. This process is sensitive to numerous disturbances that can cause the fiber to break during the drawing process. In {{order to understand the}} origin of these failures and improve the process efficiency, {{it is important to understand}} the physics of the forming fiber. We investigate here the underlying physics of the forming of a single fiber through numerical simulations. In particular, we focus on the region from the hole tips at the bushing plate to the glass transition point. The influence of key parameters (e. g. operating windows, and heat transfers mechanisms) on the fiber radius attenuation and the internal stresses is investigated through a sensitivity analysis. In addition, the impact of the temperature variations at the bushing plate is investigated. Finally, we show how the <b>forming</b> <b>stress</b> is influenced by these parameters. It is found that the internal stress can be minimizing by varying the operating windows. On the other hand, results also demonstrate that the heat pattern of the bushing plate is one of the most important causes for disturbance in the process...|$|E
40|$|AbstractFibroblasts are the {{predominant}} cell {{type in the}} cardiac interstitium. As the main matrix-producing cells in the adult mammalian heart, fibroblasts maintain {{the integrity of the}} extracellular matrix network, thus preserving geometry and function. Following myocardial infarction fibroblasts undergo dynamic phenotypic alterations and direct the reparative response. Due to their strategic location, cardiac fibroblasts serve as sentinel cells that sense injury and activate the inflammasome secreting cytokines and chemokines. During the proliferative phase of healing, infarct fibroblasts undergo myofibroblast transdifferentiation <b>forming</b> <b>stress</b> fibers and expressing contractile proteins (such as α-smooth muscle actin). Mechanical stress, transforming growth factor (TGF) -β/Smad 3 signaling and alterations in the composition of the extracellular matrix induce acquisition of the myofibroblast phenotype. In the highly cellular and growth factor-rich environment of the infarct, activated myofibroblasts produce matrix proteins, proteases and their inhibitors regulating matrix metabolism. As the infarct matures, “stress-shielding” of myofibroblasts by the cross-linked matrix and growth factor withdrawal may induce quiescence and ultimately cause apoptotic death. Because of their critical role in post-infarction cardiac remodeling, fibroblasts are promising therapeutic targets following myocardial infarction. However, the complexity of fibroblast functions and the pathophysiologic heterogeneity of post-infarction remodeling in the clinical context discourage oversimplified approaches in clinical translation.

40|$|Bone {{fractures}} affect over 1. 5 {{million people}} {{a year in the}} United States and can lead to a decrease in life expectancy and quality of life. While some fractures occur due to a single overloading event such as a fall, many fractures develop over time. Insufficiency fractures are one type of fracture that develop over time and typically occur in regions of the skeleton dominated by cancellous bone. In cancellous bone, the accumulation of microdamage results in a loss of biomechanical performance and is believed to contribute to fracture incidence. However, relatively {{little is known about the}} how microdamage accumulates in cancellous bone and the aspects of cancellous bone structure that influence the development of microdamage. While the development of microdamage is driven by stresses and strains at the tissue-level, the complex microarchitecture of cancellous bone prevents the direct measurement of tissue-level stresses/strains. Additionally, naturally <b>forming</b> <b>stress</b> concentrations called resorption cavities form on the surface of cancellous bone. Finite element models can be used to calculate the tissue-level stress/strain in cancellous bone. According to finite element models, the largest stresses/strains will occur at the surface of cancellous bone and the stresses around resorption cavities will be higher than other surfaces of the bone. However, finite element models are created from three-dimensional images of the bone and the images are not typically obtained at resolutions capable of examining resorption cavities. Additionally, the material properties of cancellous bone are not homogeneous and may influence the location of microdamage formation. The oldest and stiffest tissue is found near the center of trabeculae away from the locations that experience the highest stresses. Therefore, first, we characterized the size and location of resorption cavities. Next, we explored the spatial relationship between microdamage and resorption cavities by developing three-dimensional spatial correlation techniques and determining the spatial relationship between microdamage and resorption cavities. Finally, we examined how well tissue-level strains measured from finite element models predicted the location of microdamage The size and location of resorption cavities suggest that they can generate large stress concentrations in cancellous bone. However, microdamage preferentially formed away from resorption cavities, and the majority of microdamage was located distant from the surface of trabeculae. Additionally, reductions in biomechanical performance during fatigue loading were explained primarily by the largest microdamage sites. Hence, only microdamage sites larger than a certain size appear to influence the mechanical performance of cancellous bone following cyclic loading. Furthermore, when using finite element models, regions of cancellous bone displaying the greatest principal tissue strains were able to predict the location of the largest and most biomechanically relevant microdamage sites. Together, the current work suggests that losses in biomechanical performance following damage accumulation in cancellous bone are due to a few large microdamage sites that form near the center of trabeculae. Furthermore, microdamage accumulation is poorly related to location stress concentration due to microgeometry, suggesting that other factors such as tissue heterogeneity may be more influential in determining microdamage accumulation. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceTopographic {{influences}} {{are examined}} in an eddy-resolving model of oceanic channel flow forced by steady zonal winds. With small explicit lateral friction, transient eddies {{generated by the}} baroclinic instability of the mean flow transfer momentum downward to the bottom layer. In the flat-bottom case, bottom friction is the only efficient sink of eastward momentum. When bottom topography is present, the topographic <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> can replace the bottom friction sink in the momentum budget, and a large decrease of the zonal transport results. Large wale topography (of {{the scale of the}} forcing) provides the largest <b>form</b> <b>stress.</b> Topographic effects decay with height as suggested by the Prandit scaling, and therefore only topographic scales larger than the Rossby radius can affect the whole water column. In that case, the interfaces are deformed by standing eddies on topographic length scales, and standing eddies replace transient eddies in transferring momentum downward. The bottom-layer mean streamfunction tends to be correlated with the topography as in inviscid solutions. Because of this, {{only a small part of}} the flow (the larger scales) contributes to the domain-averaged momentum sink. On smaller scales, the topographic <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> is anticorrelated with the Reynolds stress and has no net effect on the transport. The energy level of the transients is less affected by the topography than is the mean energy.

40|$|The {{momentum}} {{balance of the}} Antarctic Circumpolar Current is investigated using both output from a highresolution primitive equation model and sea surface height measurements from the Geosat altimeter. In the Semtner–Chervin general circulation model, run with approximately one-quarter degree resolution and timevarying ECMWF winds, topographic <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> is the dominant process balancing the surface wind forcing. Detailed examination of <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> in the model indicates that it is due to three large topographic obstructions located at Kerguelen Island, Campbell Plateau, and Drake Passage. The difference between wind <b>stress</b> and <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> represents the lateral transfer of momentum {{into and out of}} the ACC. It is examined both in zonal coordinates to conform to the model architecture and along mean streamlines in order to reduce the effects of standing eddies. In this particular model, in stream coordinates, biharmonic friction dominates the lateral transfer of momentum. Since biharmonic friction is a parameterization of subgrid-scale transient eddy processes, this indicates that the unresolved transient eddy processes play a critical role in fluxing momentum across the ACC in this model. Although the relative importance of individual terms in the {{momentum balance}} does not vary substantially along streamlines, elevated levels of eddy kinetic energy are associated with the three major topographic features. In contrast, altimeter data show elevated energy levels at many more topographic features of intermediate scales, suggesting that smaller topographic effects are better able to communicate with the surface in the real ocean than in the model. 1...|$|R

40|$|There is {{an ongoing}} {{discussion}} in the community concerning the wave-averaged momentum equations in the hybrid vertically Lagrangian and horizontally Eulerian (VL) framework and, in particular, the <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> term (representing the residual effect of pressure perturbations) which is thought to restrict the handling of higher order waves {{in terms of a}} perturbation expansion. The present study shows that the traditional pressure-based <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> term can be transformed into a set of terms that do not contain any pressure quantities but do contain the time derivative of a wave-induced velocity. This wave-induced velocity {{is referred to as the}} pseudomomentum in the VL framework, as it is analogous to the generalized pseudomomentum in Andrews and McIntyre. This enables the second expression for the wave-averaged momentum equations in the VL framework (this time for the development of the total transport velocity minus the VL pseudomomentum) to be derived together with the vortex force. The velocity-based expression of the <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> term also contains the residual effect of the turbulent viscosity, which is useful for understanding the dissipation of wave energy leading to transfer of momentum from waves to circulation. It is found that the concept of the virtual wave stress of Longuet-Higgins is applicable to quite general situations: it does not matter whether there is wind forcing or not, the waves can have slow variations, and the viscosity coefficient can vary in the vertical. These results provide a basis for revisiting the surface boundary condition used in numerical circulation models...|$|R
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) in a near-eddy-resolving model of the Southern Ocean (FRAM) are investigated. A streamwise coordinate system is used, rather than a more conventional approach of considering zonally averaged quantities. The motivation for this approach is the large deviation from a purely zonal flow made by the current. Comparisons are made with a zonal-mean analysis of the same model. It is found that the topographic form drag is the main sink of the momentum that is input by the wind. However, {{in contrast to a}} zonal-mean analysis other terms, namely, horizontal mixing, bottom friction, and advection of momentum, are no longer negligible. The total effect of transient eddies is to produce a drag on the mean flow, again in contrast to the zonally averaged case. The vertical penetration of stress is considered. A generalized formula is derived for the interfacial <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> averaged along a convoluted path and that includes nonquasigeostrophic effects. The interfacial <b>form</b> <b>stress</b> is found to be related not only to the local wind stress but also to changes in stratification and the Coriolis parameter along the path of integration. The vertical gradient of the extra terms is found to be proportional to the quasimeridional velocity averaged along an isopycnic surface. Using the model data, the nonquasigeostrophic effects are found to be important, particularly toward the northern flank of the ACC. Relating the vertical shear of the flow to the interfacial <b>form</b> <b>stress,</b> it is shown that the vertical structure of the flow is set by a combination of the wind stress and the meridional overturning. There is, therefore, an intimate linking of the wind and thermohaline-driven circulations...|$|R
