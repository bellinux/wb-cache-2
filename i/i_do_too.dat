Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and <b>I</b> <b>do,</b> <b>too.</b> I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and then he added his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E

But Jim came to New Mexico with Hardman. They were getting along all right when we arrived. But, trouble soon arose--and that over Lucy.... Young Dick Hardman--you certainly ought to remember him, Pan--fell {{madly in love with}} Lucy. Dick always was a wild boy. Here in Marco he went the pace. Well, bad as Jard Hardman is he loves that boy and would move heaven and earth for him. Lucy despised Dick. The more he ran after her the more she despised him. Also the more she flouted Dick the wilder he drank and gambled. Now here comes the pitiful part of it. Jim Blake went utterly to the bad, so your father says, though Lucy hopes and believes she can save him. <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>too.</b> Jim was only weak. Jard Hardman ruined him. Finally Dick enlisted his father in his cause and they forced Jim to try to make Lucy marry Dick. She refused. She left her father's place and went to live with her Uncle Bill, who was an honest fine man. But he was shot in the Yellow Mine. By accident, they gave out, but your father scouts that idea... Oh, those dreadful gambling hells! Life is cheap here.... Lucy came to live with us. She taught the school. But she had to give that up. Dick Hardman and other wild young fellows made her life wretched. Besides she was never safe. We persuaded her to give it up. And then the--the worst happened." ...|$|E

We women of Vissarion, in all the history of centuries, have never put ourselves forward in rivalry of our lords. Well I know that my own dear lord will forgive me as wife if I err; but I speak to you, the Council of the nation, from another ground and with another tongue. My lord does not, I fear, know as you do, and as <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>too,</b> that of old, {{in the history of this}} Land, when Kingship was existent, that it was ruled by that law of masculine supremacy which, centuries after, became known as the Lex Salica. Lords of the Council of the Blue Mountains, I am a wife of the Blue Mountains--as a wife young as yet, but with the blood of forty generations of loyal women in my veins. And it would ill become me, whom my husband honours--wife to the man whom you would honour--to take a part in changing the ancient custom which has been held in honour for all the thousand years, which is the glory of Blue Mountain womanhood. What an example such would be in an age when self-seeking women of other nations seek to forget their womanhood in the struggle to vie in equality with men! Men of the Blue Mountains, I speak for our women when I say that we hold of greatest price the glory of our men. To be their companions is our happiness; to be their wives is the completion of our lives; to be mothers of their children is our share of the glory that is theirs.|$|E

He's got a way with words and <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>too.</b> We both write a different type of song than what passes today for songwriting.” The only other writer Dylan has ever collaborated with to such a degree is Jacques Levy, with whom he wrote most of the songs on Desire in 1976.|$|E
