40|$|From {{the end of}} World War II {{until the}} {{beginning}} of the decade of the sixties, non-bank financial institutions in the United States experienced a far greater growth rate than did commercial banks. By contrast, in the 1960 s the growth rate of commercial banks sharply accelerated, while that of the nonblanks held rather stable. In the present work, t is argued that more aggressive competition by banks in the sixties necessarily reflected a revolutionary willingness to take the risk that higher and costlier time deposit rates would cut into the banks’ own monopoly in providing demand deposits. The major theme of the paper is that the banks’ willingness to compete is directly quantifiable by reviewing their willingness to accept narrower profit margins. These narrower margins resulted from a faster rise in TD rates than in rates of return on bank credit; it was the banks’ acceptance of the new set of cost/return functions that helped them to bid funds away <b>from</b> <b>non-banks.</b> Finally, a rise in leveraging of capital accounts and faster asset growth by banks allowed them to maintain profit rates, while, under that same competitive pressure, nonbank profit rates receded.

An example of an organisation in which the implementation of a centralised computer-based system, whilst potentially desirable, does not satisfy the short-term information needs of the company is given.

40|$|How {{much does}} {{the private sector}} really borrow? A new {{database}} for total credit to the private nonfinancial sector 1 Despite their importance, data capturing total credit to the private non-financial sector are scarce. This article introduces a new BIS database that provides this information for 40 economies with, on average, more than 45 years of quarterly data, reaching back to the 1940 s and 1950 s in some cases. It explains the key concepts underlying the compilation of the new series, including {{a description of the}} high-level statistical criteria applied, the characteristics of the underlying series used and the statistical techniques employed. For illustration purposes, some facets of the historical evolution of total credit are explored, revealing interesting similarities and differences across countries. JEL classification: C 82, E 51. Credit is vital for economic activity. Households borrow to smooth consumption and purchase homes. Firms often require credit to finance investments. Unsurprisingly, private sector borrowing has important implications for policy. It influences the monetary transmission mechanism and is a major determinant of financial stability – history shows that systemic banking crises tend to be preceded by unusually large build-ups of credit in the private sector. Despite this importance, series for total credit to the non-financial private sector have not been readily available. Even in countries that compile financial accounts, the series for total credit tend to be quite short. As a result, practitioners and researchers have often resorted to well established statistics on bank credit that fail to include credit <b>from</b> <b>non-banks</b> or foreign lenders. To remedy this, BIS statisticians have compiled long-run series of total credit for 40 advanced and emerging market economies. In doing so, they consulted national 1 The construction of the long-run credit series would have been impossible without the extensiv...|$|E
50|$|Re-intermediation {{in banking}} and finance {{can be defined}} as the {{movement}} of investment capital <b>from</b> <b>non-bank</b> investments, back into financial intermediaries. This is usually done in efforts to secure depository insurance on the capital, during times of high risk and volatility in market interest rates. Conceptually, Reintermediation {{can be thought of as}} an answer to disintermediation, which is the movement of investment funds away from financial intermediaries into other investments. Disintermediation occurs naturally, as competition from different financial firms can allow for higher investment yield, which causes funds to flow away from depository institutions.|$|R
40|$|Access to {{external}} finance {{is a key}} determinant of a firm's ability to develop, operate and expand. To date, the literature has examined a variety of macroeconomic and microeconomic factors that influence firm financing. In this paper, we examine access by Spanish firms {{to external}} financing, both <b>from</b> bank and <b>non-bank</b> sources. We use dynamic panel data estimation techniques to estimate our models over a sample of 60, 000 firms {{during the period from}} 1992 to 2002. We find that Spanish firms are quite dependent on short-term non-bank financing (such as trade credit), which makes up about 65 percent of total firm debt. Our results indicate that this type of financing is less sensitive to firm characteristics than short-term bank financing. However, we also find that short-term bank debt seems to be accessed more during economic expansions, which may suggest a substitution away <b>from</b> <b>non-bank</b> financing as firm conditions improve. Short-term bank debt also seems to be accessed more as funding rates rise, possibly again suggesting a substitution away <b>from</b> higher-priced <b>non-bank</b> alternatives. Using data from the Spanish Credit Register maintained by the Banco de Espana, we find that the impact of funding costs on access to external financing, whether <b>from</b> banks or <b>non-banks,</b> is affected by the nature of borrowing firms' bank relationships and collateral. In particular, we provide evidence of a potential hold-up problem in loan markets. Moreover, collateral {{plays a key role in}} making long-term finance available to firms. Bank competition...|$|R

40|$|Total credit as {{an early}} warning {{indicator}} for systemic banking crises 1 Credit-to-GDP gaps are valuable early warning indicators for systemic banking crises. As such, they are useful for identifying vulnerabilities and can help guide the deployment of macroprudential tools such as the build-up of countercyclical capital buffers. In line with Basel III recommendations, credit-to-GDP gaps can be further improved by taking account of all sources of credit to the private non-financial sector, rather than just bank credit. Drawing on a new BIS database, this special feature finds that total credit developments predict the risk of systemic crises better than indicators based solely on bank credit. JEL classification: E 44, G 01. Financial crises are usually preceded by private sector credit booms. 2 This insight {{can be used to}} construct early warning indicators for crises. Yet much of the work on such indicators is based only on credit granted by domestic banks, even though this aggregate excludes lending <b>from</b> <b>non-banks</b> or foreigners. However, such lending can be significant. A new BIS database reveals, for example, that banks may provide as little as 30 % of total credit to the private non-financial sector, as is currently the case in the United States. This special feature assesses whether credit from all sources (ie total credit) has different early warning properties than bank credit. It extends previous BIS work (eg Borio and Lowe (2002), Borio and Drehmann (2009)) which finds that credit booms can be successfully captured by the so-called credit-to-GDP gap. 3 In particular, the analysis draws on the new BIS database covering bank and total credit to the private non-financial sector (Dembiermont et al (2013)). The sample comprises 39 emerging market and advanced economies, starting at the earliest in 1970 and capturing 33 crises. ...|$|E

The global financial crisis provided a number of new experiences on the contribution of fund managers to systemic risk. In this article, we focus on these lessons from the crisis. We distinguish between three sources of systemic risk in the financial system that may arise from fund management: insufficient credit risk transfer to fund managers; runs on funds that cause sudden reductions in funding to banks and other financial entities; and contagion through business ties between fund managers and their sponsors.
