5|$|San Francisco {{had been}} a tiny {{settlement}} before the rush began. When residents learned about the discovery, it at first became a ghost town of abandoned ships and businesses, but then boomed as merchants and new people arrived. The population of San Francisco <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> perhaps about 1,000 in 1848 to 25,000 full-time residents by 1850. Miners lived in tents, wood shanties, or deck cabins removed from abandoned ships.|$|E
25|$|Between 1970 and 1972, Cerritos was {{the fastest}} growing city in California. The {{population}} <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> 16,000 to 38,000. Since the 1980s, Cerritos has attracted {{a large number of}} Filipino, Korean, Taiwanese, Indian, and Chinese immigrant families.|$|E
25|$|The {{town was}} less than a year old and its {{population}} had <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> about 100 residents in March 1879 when it consisted mostly of wooden shacks and tents. By the fall of 1879 more than a thousand hardy miners and merchants lived in a canvas and matchstick camp built on top of the richest silver strike in the United States. On September 9,1880, the richly appointed Grand Hotel was opened, adorned with fine oil paintings, thick Brussels carpets, toilet stands, elegant chandeliers, silk-covered furniture, walnut furniture, and a kitchen with hot and cold running water.|$|E

25|$|Starting in 1849, many of {{the ship}} crews jumped ship {{and headed for the}} gold fields when they reached port. Soon San Francisco Bay had many {{hundreds}} of abandoned ships anchored offshore. The better ships were recrewed and put back in the shipping and passenger business. Others were bought cheap and hauled up on the mud flats and used as store ships, saloons, temporary stores, floating warehouses, homes, {{and a number of other}} uses. Many of these repurposed ships were partially destroyed in one of San Francisco's many fires and ended up as landfill to expand the available land. The population of San Francisco <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> about 200 in 1846 to 36,000 in the 1852 California Census.|$|E
25|$|In 1801 the U.S. {{government}} purchased land on Wallabout Bay for {{the construction}} of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, stimulating some growth in the area. Ferry service linking Manhattan and Brooklyn launched in 1814, and Brooklyn's population <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> 4,000 to nearly 100,000 by 1850. Fort Greene was known as The Hill and was home to a small commuter population, several large farms—the Post Farm, the Spader farm, the Ryerson Farm, and the Jackson farm—and a burial ground. As early as the 1840s the farms' owners began selling off their land in smaller plots for development. Country villas, frame row houses, and the occasional brick row house dotted the countryside, {{and one of them was}} home to poet Walt Whitman, editor of the Brooklyn Eagle newspaper.|$|E
25|$|On 23 June Burr, Hopewell, Swallow and Content arrived between Cape Corrientes and Cape San Antonio {{and soon}} sighted six sail. Having {{believed}} {{they might have}} been treasure ships from Cartagena the English closed, only to discover the force was Ribera’s 700-ton flagship Galleon Nuestra Señora del Rosario, Vice Admiral Aparicio de Arteaga’s 650-ton Magdalena, two other large galleons, and a pair of galleys. Despite being heavily outnumbered the English stood formation and a long-range exchange commenced at 7:00 am. This lasted for the next three hours, after which the English formation scattered. During this time Burr <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> a catastrophic fire in the magazine either from a stray Spanish shot or by complete accident. Irish and sixteen survivors were rescued by the Swallow which soon after withdrew from the area. Soon after the 100-ton galleys San Agustín and Brava then closed in on the two remaining English vessels and attempted to board by grappling. They were however repelled by heavy gunfire from Hopewell and Content in a defensive position. The Spanish galleys, unable to make an impression and suffering considerable damage then stood off and rejoined de la Ribera's galleons. Soon after the English ships departed and sailed to Cape San Antonio but sighted nothing of value. Content got lost during the night and was unable to find any other ships and may have headed all the way to Florida.|$|E

500|$|Meanwhile, on the {{afternoon}} of 6 April, the South Vietnamese inside Lộc Ninh were slightly reinforced by the 3rd Battalion, ARVN 9th Infantry Regiment, along with the men of the 1st Cavalry Squadron at FSB Alpha who had refused to surrender. Furthermore, wounded South Vietnamese soldiers who were still able to fight made their way back to the defensive perimeter to await the next wave of attacks. During the night, the South Vietnamese compound descended into chaos when North Vietnamese artillery scored a direct hit on the hospital bunker, killing a large number of wounded men. Later on, another round of rockets struck the South Vietnamese artillery compound, striking [...] the ammunition storage bunker, which <b>exploded.</b> <b>From</b> {{the eastern side of the}} district, the Viet Cong tried to penetrate the defense line at Lộc Ninh, but were beaten off. Realizing that the situation had become hopeless, Vinh took off his uniform and told his to surrender.|$|E
500|$|Boullemer's {{wrote his}} sensational account {{well after the}} fact, {{in the safety of}} Rennes, where he was taken after being rescued by republican forces. Boullemer {{admitted}} that he had spent most of the six weeks of the upheaval at Machecoul in the safety of his granary, hiding from the peasants. His account of the terror, though lost nothing in {{the fact that he had}} seen little: the peasants in the town sounded the , he wrote, and others <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> the surrounding fields. Within a short time the entire affair had become a wholesale massacre of republican troops, the constitutional priest, known radical sympathizers and anyone involved with the municipal administration. [...] Prisoners had their hands tied behind their backs, and were linked with a rope passed under their armpits, in a so-called rosary; then they were dragged into fields and forced to dig their own graves before being gunned down. Patriots, those who supported the revolution, were hunted down, lashed to trees, and emasculated. Patriot women were raped and cut down in orchards. [...] Boullemer placed the count of the dead at 552.|$|E

Although this {{was intended as}} a one-shot tale, the three future teens returned as guest stars in late 1959, and over the next three years, the Legion appeared periodically in Superboy, Supergirl (who also joined the Legion), and even Superman stories. The team membership also <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> the initial three members to nearly twenty. Finally, the Legion got its own feature, starting in Adventure Comics #300 (1962), with Superboy usually, but not always, appearing as part of the team.|$|E

60|$|In fact, these {{singular}} explosions {{have received}} fanciful explanations from learned men, {{and have not}} been satisfactorily accounted for even by philosophers. They are said to occur frequently in Brazil. Vasconcelles, Jesuit father, describes one which he heard in the Sierra, or mountain region of Piratininga, and which he compares to the discharges of a park of artillery. The Indians {{told him that it}} was an explosion of stones. The worthy father had soon a satisfactory proof of the truth of their information, for the very place was found where a rock had burst and <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> its entrails a stony mass, like a bomb-shell, and of the size of a bull's heart. This mass was broken either in its ejection or its fall, and wonderful was the internal organization revealed. It had a shell harder even than iron; within which were arranged, like the seeds of a pomegranate, jewels of various colors; some transparent as crystals; others of a fine red, and others of mixed hues. The same phenomenon is said to occur occasionally in the adjacent province of Guayra, where stones of the bigness of a man's hand are exploded, with a loud noise, from the bosom of the earth, and scatter about glittering and beautiful fragments that look like precious gems, but are of no value.|$|E
60|$|Horse-forage abounds here; {{but there}} is no getting of it without {{disturbance}} from those dogs; you must fight for every truss of grass: if a meal-train is coming, as there does every five days, you have to detach 8,000 foot and 3,000 horse to help it safe in. A fretting fatiguing time for regular troops. Our bakery is at Trautenau,--where Valori is now lodging. The Tolpatchery, unable to take Trautenau, set fire to it, though it is their own town, their own Queen's town; thatchy Trautenau, wooden too in the upper stories of it, takes greedily to the fire; goes all aloft in flame, and then lies black. A scandalous transaction, thinks Friedrich. The Prussian corn lay nearly all in cellars; little got, even of the Prussians, by such an atrocity: and your own poor fellow-subjects, where are they? Valori was burnt out here; again <b>exploded</b> <b>from</b> his quarters, poor man;--seems to have thought it a mere fire in his own lodging, and that he was an unfortunate diplomatist. Happily he got notice (PRIVATISSIME, for no officer dare whisper in such cases) that there is an armed party setting out for Silesia, to guard meal that is coming: Valori yokes himself to this armed party, and gets safe over the Hills with it,--then swift, by extra post, to Breslau and to civilized (partially civilized) accommodation, for a little rest after these hustlings and tossings.|$|E
