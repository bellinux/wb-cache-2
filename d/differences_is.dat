It is unknown if this is derived from the turtle's diet, which includes biofluorescent organisms like the hard coral Physogyra lichtensteini.

30|$|Simple <b>differences</b> <b>are</b> most {{representative}} if the <b>difference</b> level <b>is</b> {{independent of}} the perfusion level.

50|$|Subtraction is {{the inverse}} of addition. Subtraction finds the {{difference}} between two numbers, the minuend minus the subtrahend. If the minuend {{is larger than the}} subtrahend, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> positive; if the minuend is smaller than the subtrahend, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> negative; if they <b>are</b> equal, the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> 0.|$|R

25|$|The partial {{differences}} {{method is}} different from other vertical subtraction methods because no borrowing or carrying takes place. In their place, one places plus or minus signs {{depending on whether the}} minuend is greater or smaller than the subtrahend. The sum of the partial <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> the total difference.|$|E
30|$|The A values {{greater than}} 0 {{indicated}} that the <b>difference</b> in intra-group <b>is</b> greater than that in inter-group, but less than 0 represented that the <b>difference</b> in inter-group <b>is</b> greater than that in intra-group. Observe-delta value is smaller which indicates that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> small within groups, and the Expect-delta value is greater which indicates that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> great between groups. The significance value below 0.05 indicate that the <b>difference</b> <b>is</b> significant.|$|R
30|$|The {{significance}} of <b>differences</b> <b>was</b> assessed using two-tailed Student’s t tests or one-way ANOVA. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> {{considered to be}} significant {{at a level of}} p[*]<[*] 0.05.|$|R

25|$|The {{opposition}} Conservative Party {{supported the}} concept of a bill, and proposed their own variation ahead of the Government's. One of the key <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> that they were demanding annual carbon targets, and that the Committee on Climate Change should have an enhanced role, setting targets as well as advising governments.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{application of}} finite <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> in numerical analysis, especially in numerical differential equations, which {{aim at the}} numerical solution of ordinary and partial differential equations respectively. The idea is to replace the derivatives appearing in the differential equation by finite differences that approximate them. The resulting methods are called finite difference methods.|$|E
25|$|The {{gameplay}} {{dynamics of}} BS Zelda no Densetsu (and BS Zelda no Densetsu: MAP2) are most closely {{comparable to those}} of the first The Legend of Zelda, however a few major differences exist between Zelda and BS Zelda which make the two play-through experiences distinctly different. Foremost among these <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> the use of SoundLink data to supplement and provide plot for BS Zelda.|$|E
30|$|Results were {{presented}} as mean ± SEM. For comparison between two groups, <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> analyzed by 2 -tailed Student’s t-test. <b>Differences</b> <b>were</b> considered significant at {{a value of}} P < 0.05.|$|R

25|$|Ageing or aging (see {{spelling}} <b>differences)</b> <b>is</b> {{the process}} of becoming older. The term refers especially to human beings, many animals, and fungi, whereas for example bacteria, perennial plants and some simple animals are potentially immortal. In the broader sense, ageing can refer to single cells within an organism which have ceased dividing (cellular senescence) or to the population of a species (population ageing).|$|E
25|$|One of the {{problems}} is that statisticians have tended not to publish their match lists with their findings. It should, however, be noted that the number of <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> extremely small in terms of the sport's overall statistics. The status of pre-definition matches is primarily a statistical concern rather than a historical one. Historians record the importance of a match in contemporary terms regardless of statistical hindsight.|$|E
25|$|Unit {{conversion}} for temperature <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> {{simply a}} matter of multiplying by, e.g., 1°F / 1 K (although the ratio is not a constant value). But because some of these scales have origins that do not correspond to absolute zero, conversion from one temperature scale to another requires accounting for that. As a result, simple dimensional analysis can lead to errors if it is ambiguous whether 1 K means the absolute temperature equal to −273.15°C, or the temperature difference equal to 1°C.|$|E
30|$|Intergroup {{analysis}} showed time dependent {{significant differences between}} the groups. Although no significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found in pre-treatment evaluation between the groups, significant <b>differences</b> <b>were</b> found between the groups I and II at 3 rd day and 1 st month VAS values (p <  0.01).

25|$|A major {{question}} is whether human psychological faculties are mostly innate or whether they are mostly a result of learning, and hence subject to cultural and social processes such as language. The innate view holds that humans share {{the same set of}} basic faculties, and that variability due to cultural <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> less important and that the human mind is a mostly biological construction, so that all humans sharing the same neurological configuration can be expected to have similar cognitive patterns.|$|E
25|$|A major {{difficulty}} {{in reviewing the}} works of Ikram arises {{from the fact that}} he published interim works which he revised often, in the light of his new findings: correcting mistakes, adding, deleting, and rearranging sections, expanding one volume into two (changing the title of the work in the new edition and reverting to the old title in the next edition). In many cases the revisions were sufficiently major for the original and the revised to be treated as two separate works. A study of these <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> still awaited.|$|E

25|$|Animism is not {{the same}} as pantheism, {{although}} the two are sometimes confused. Some religions are both pantheistic and animistic. One of the main <b>differences</b> <b>is</b> that while animists believe everything to be spiritual in nature, they do not necessarily see the spiritual nature of everything in existence as being united (monism), the way pantheists do. As a result, animism puts more emphasis on the uniqueness of each individual soul. In pantheism, everything shares the same spiritual essence, rather than having distinct spirits and/or souls.|$|E
25|$|Globalization (or globalisation; see {{spelling}} <b>differences)</b> <b>is</b> {{the increasing}} interaction of {{people through the}} growth of the international flow of money, ideas and culture. Globalization is primarily an economic process of integration which has social and cultural aspects as well. It involves goods and services, and the economic resources of capital, technology and data. Advances in the means of transport (such as the steam locomotive, steamship, jet engine, and container ships) and in telecommunications infrastructure (including the rise of the telegraph and its modern offspring, the Internet and mobile phones) have been major factors in globalization, generating further interdependence of economic and cultural activities.|$|E

In cases where the transcription of the sign remains in doubt, Bennett's number serves to identify the sign.
