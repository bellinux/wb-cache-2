5|$|MGySgt Guadalupe Denogean is an {{immigrant}} from Mexico {{who has served}} in the Marine Corps for 25 years. Denogean was wounded in combat in Basra, Iraq. During {{the time that he}} received treatment for his wounds, he was asked if he had any requests. His answer was that he had two: First, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> promotion for the corporal who helped rescue him, and second he wanted to be an American citizen.|$|E
5|$|The {{character}} of Jareth also underwent some significant developments {{during the early}} stages of pre-production. According to Henson he was originally meant to be another puppet creature in the same vein as his goblin subjects. Henson eventually decided <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> big, charismatic star to play the Goblin King, and decided to pursue a musician for the role. Sting, Prince, Mick Jagger, and Michael Jackson were considered for the part; however, it was ultimately decided that David Bowie would be the most suitable choice.|$|E
5|$|The {{game was}} {{developed}} because the designer Gregg Barnett wanted a large adventure for CD-based systems. A licence {{was difficult to}} obtain; Pratchett was reluctant to grant one as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> Discworld game to be developed by a company with a reputation and who cared about the property. An original story was created due to Barnett having difficulty basing games on one book. Discworld was praised for its humour, voice-acting and graphics, though some criticised its gameplay and difficult puzzles. Discworld {{was followed by a}} sequel, , in 1996.|$|E

5|$|Tod favoured the then-fashionable {{concept of}} Romantic nationalism. Influenced by this, {{he thought that}} each princely state should be {{inhabited}} by only one community and his policies were designed to expel Marathas, Pindaris and other groups from Rajput territories. It also influenced his instigation of treaties that were intended to redraw the territorial boundaries of the various states. The geographical and political boundaries before his time had in some cases been blurred, primarily due to local arrangements based on common kinship, and <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> more evident delineation of the entities, He was successful {{in both of these}} endeavours.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of losing her match against her father, Stephanie McMahon {{was forced to resign}} as SmackDown! General Manager. On the SmackDown {{following}} No Mercy, Vince McMahon announced Paul Heyman as the new General Manager. Heyman booked a Handicap match, in which the Undertaker faced Brock Lesnar and the Big Show. Heyman stated that should Undertaker win, he could face anyone he wished at Survivor Series. During the match, there were several opportunities in which the Undertaker would have won the match, but Heyman restarted the contest three times. The Undertaker did, however, win the contest, and announced <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> Buried Alive match against Vince McMahon. McMahon would go on to win the match with the aid of the Undertaker's half-brother Kane.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.|$|E

5|$|In the {{following}} year, the Persian satrap (governor) of Caria, Pixodarus, offered his eldest daughter to Alexander's half-brother, Philip Arrhidaeus. Olympias {{and several of}} Alexander's friends suggested this showed Philip intended to make Arrhidaeus his heir. Alexander reacted by sending an actor, Thessalus of Corinth, to tell Pixodarus {{that he should not}} offer his daughter's hand to an illegitimate son, but instead to Alexander. When Philip heard of this, he stopped the negotiations and scolded Alexander for wishing to marry the daughter of a Carian, explaining that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> better bride for him. Philip exiled four of Alexander's friends, Harpalus, Nearchus, Ptolemy and Erigyius, and had the Corinthians bring Thessalus to him in chains.|$|E
5|$|New Line {{believed}} Freddy vs. Jason {{needed a}} fresh start, and choose a new actor for Jason. Cunningham disagreed with their decision, believing Hodder {{was the best}} choice for the role. Hodder did receive the script for Freddy vs. Jason, and had a meeting with director Ronny Yu and New Line executives, but Matthew Barry and Yu felt the role should be recast to fit Yu's image of Jason. According to Hodder, New Line failed to provide him with a reason for the recasting, but Yu has explained <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> slower, more deliberate Jason, and less of the aggressive movements that Hodder had used in the previous films. Yu and development executive Jeff Katz recognized the outcry among fans over the replacement of Hodder as Jason, but stood by their choice in recasting.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} to {{civilian}} life, Agnew resumed his legal studies, and secured {{a job as a}} law clerk with the Baltimore firm of Smith and Barrett. Until now, Agnew had been largely apolitical; his nominal allegiance had been to the Democratic Party, following his father's beliefs. The firm's senior partner, Lester Barrett, advised Agnew that if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> career in politics he should become a Republican. There were already many ambitious young Democrats in Baltimore and its suburbs, whereas competent, personable Republicans were scarcer. Agnew took Barrett's advice; on moving with his wife and children to the Baltimore suburb of Lutherville in 1947, he registered as a Republican, though he did not immediately become involved in politics.|$|E
5000|$|Her critics see Doyle as advocating {{that women}} should be {{submissive}} to their husbands, even referring to 'Stepford Wives'. Former Australian Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Sex Discrimination Commissioner Pru Goward compared the movement to slavery saying [...] "There {{is no such thing}} as an adult who can entirely subvert themselves to another person. That's called slavery and I think we abolished that several hundred years ago." [...] She also claimed that [...] "If <b>a</b> man <b>wants</b> that sort of relationship, <b>he</b> actually doesn't <b>want</b> <b>a</b> relationship, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> doll. <b>He</b> <b>wants</b> <b>a</b> puppet, <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> total control and that's not the definition of a relationship." ...|$|R

5|$|On {{the episode}} of Raw {{following}} Over the Limit, Bret Hart was announced {{as the new}} Raw General Manager. During Batista's promo {{at the beginning of}} the show, Hart interrupted and told him that if <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> rematch against Cena, he would have to qualify for the Fatal 4-way match at the Fatal 4-Way pay-per-view in June. Batista refused to wrestle, citing his injuries, and as a result Hart awarded the match to his opponent Orton by forfeit. Following Hart's decision, Batista quit WWE. This storyline was put in place as Batista was legitimately leaving WWE to pursue acting and a career in mixed martial arts.|$|E
5|$|Phil {{explains}} to Mulder that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> divorce from Ellen two years ago, {{but she got}} pregnant and would not allow it. He also believes {{that he is the}} reason for this happening and that he somehow summoned the entity. It turns out that Ellen is the entity, which is given away by a cut in her back given by Jenny during the attack. Ellen transforms into the creature, attacks Mulder, and attempts to drown him in a bath tub, but stops when she sees her monstrous reflection in the water. She is placed in a psychiatric hospital, where the doctors diagnose her with multiple personality disorder. Meanwhile, Scully reveals to Mulder that the mysterious prostitute killer was not an X-File at all, but rather a man disguised as a woman who talked to the prostitutes about religion and attempted to help them get out of the prostitution ring.|$|E
5|$|Super Mario Land was {{developed}} by Nintendo R and published by Nintendo in 1989 as a launch title for their Game Boy handheld console. Nintendo CEO Hiroshi Yamauchi believed that fun games sold consoles, so when the company created the Game Boy handheld console, <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> fun game that would feature Nintendo's mascot, Mario, and subsequently sell consoles. The job fell to Nintendo R, a development team led by Game Boy inventor Gunpei Yokoi. Yokoi had previously created the Game & Watch series and worked with his protégé, Shigeru Miyamoto, on the game that invented Mario, Donkey Kong. Super Mario Land was the fourth Super Mario title, the first portable Mario game, and {{the first in the}} series to be made without Miyamoto.|$|E

5|$|Taylor rebounded in {{the early}} stages of what many thought would be his final season in 1992. Through close to nine games Taylor was on pace for 10 sacks and the Giants were 5–4. However, a {{ruptured}} Achilles tendon suffered in a game on November 8, 1992 against Green Bay sidelined him for the final seven games, during which the team went 1–6. Before the injury Taylor had missed only four games due to injury in his 12-year career. Throughout the 1992 season, and the ensuing offseason, Taylor was noncommittal about his future, alternately saying he might retire, then later hinting <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> longer-term contract.|$|E
5|$|The film {{begins with}} Rahul Khanna (Shah Rukh Khan) {{standing}} in front of the funeral pyre of his wife Tina (Rani Mukerji). Through a series of flashbacks we are shown Rahul and Tina's marriage, their honeymoon, Tina's pregnancy with their daughter and the child's eventual birth. It is revealed that Tina was aware of complications in her pregnancy, during which only mother or child could be saved, but decided not to tell Rahul as she knew how much <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> child. During her pregnancy, Tina, who also loved the baby more than her own life, writes eight letters to her daughter (one for each of her first eight birthdays) and gives them to Rahul's mother (Farida Jalal). Before dying, Tina asks Rahul to promise her to name their daughter Anjali.|$|E
5|$|Twenty years later, the {{neighboring}} home was purchased, joined together, and a faux façade was built. Keystone Hall {{was now a}} fully functioning residence for the governor. By 1959, the home had fallen into such disrepair that the home was sold and demolished the following year. (The governors used the State House at Indiantown Gap during this period.) Arthur James proposed a new governors residence in 1941. <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> grand house built in the William & Mary (Williamsburg) style architecture. However, it took over 25 years for his idea to come to fruition. In 1968, the current residence opened to welcome the Ray Shafer family. It has been {{the home of the}} governor ever since.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, Kitase knew <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> {{thematic}} {{combination of}} fantasy and realism. To this end, he aimed {{to include a}} cast of characters {{who appeared to be}} ordinary people. Character designer and battle visual director Tetsuya Nomura and art director Yusuke Naora strove to achieve this impression through the inclusion of realistically proportioned characters—a departure from the super deformed designs used in the previous title. Additionally, Naora attempted to enhance the realism of the world through predominantly bright lighting effects with shadows distributed as appropriate. Other measures taken included implementing rental cars for travel in-game, and the use of motion capture technology to give the game's characters lifelike movements in the game's full motion video sequences. The FMV sequences were created by a team of roughly 35 people, with the total cinematic run-time being estimated at over an hour, approximately 20 minutes longer than the FMV sequences in VII. Motion capture was used to give a general realism to character movement, but the team favored manual animation over relying on motion capture. A major challenge was the technical advances made since the release of VII, and the aim for more realistic characters. A major issue with the cutscenes was having real-time character models moving across environments within an FMV.|$|E
5|$|Groves and Parsons {{drafted a}} {{proposed}} organization and charter for the AFSWP, which they sent to Eisenhower and Nimitz for approval in July 1947. Groves {{did not get}} everything that he asked for; <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> status {{equal to that of}} a deputy to the Chief of Staff and Chief of Naval Operations, but the most that Eisenhower and Nimitz would allow was a status equal to that of the heads of a technical service, although Groves still reported directly to them. They also characterized his role as a staff post rather than a command, although Groves was already exercising the functions of a commander at Sandia. After the National Security Act of 1947 created an independent Air Force, Groves reported to the Chief of Staff of the Air Force as well, and was given a second deputy chief from the Air Force, Major General Roscoe C. Wilson, who had worked on the Silverplate project during the war.|$|E
5|$|In July 1945, Lawton handed in a {{transfer}} request at Everton as <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>a</b> {{move to a}} Southern club so as {{to see more of}} his increasingly estranged wife. In November 1945, he was sold to Chelsea for a fee of £14,000. Chelsea continued to play regional wartime fixtures as national league football had not resumed for the 1945–46 season, and Lawton also continued his uncapped appearances for the England national team. In the summer of 1946, following his demobilisation, he coached for the FA in a summer camp in Switzerland. He scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season. However he struggled to settle at Stamford Bridge and came into conflict with manager Billy Birrell after refusing to go on a pre-season tour of Sweden in 1947, which resulted in him requesting {{a transfer}}. He favoured a move to Arsenal, but this was ruled out by the Chelsea hierarchy. Lawton turned down an approach by Sunderland manager Bill Murray as he held out hope that Chelsea would relent and allow him a move to Arsenal.|$|E
