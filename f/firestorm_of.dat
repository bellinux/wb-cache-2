5|$|Uncle Tom's Cabin has exerted an {{influence}} equaled by few other novels in history. Upon publication, Uncle Tom's Cabin ignited a <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from defenders of slavery (who created {{a number of}} books in response to the novel) while the book elicited praise from abolitionists. As a best-seller, the novel heavily influenced later protest literature.|$|E
5|$|Part of {{this scheme}} was the {{announcement}} of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, {{which led to the}} discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off. Pennsylvania revoked the cartel's charter, and non-preferential rates were restored for the time being. While competitors may have been unhappy, Rockefeller's efforts did bring American consumers cheaper kerosene and other oil by-products. Before 1870, oil light was only for the wealthy, provided by expensive whale oil. But during the next decade, kerosene became commonly available to the working and middle classes.|$|E

25|$|As {{the amount}} of {{territory}} controlled by German forces decreased, the task of Bomber Command became somewhat easier, as more friendly territory was overflown during missions.

25|$|The raw and {{undifferentiated}} {{nature of}} Matthews' Appendix IX, which listed communists alongside liberals and even centrists {{in a single}} list, lead to a <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> criticism and a quick effort at the document's recall.

25|$|In 1854, Congress {{passed the}} Kansas–Nebraska Act, which opened those territories to slavery if the local {{residents}} voted that way. The antislavery gains made in previous compromises were reversed. A <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> outrage brought together former Whigs, Know-Nothings, and former Free Soil Democrats {{to form a}} new party in 1854–56, the Republican Party. It included a program of rapid modernization involving the government promotion of industry, railroads, banks, free homesteads, and colleges, all to the annoyance of the South. The new party denounced the Slave Power – that is the political power of the slave owners who supposedly controlled the national government for their own benefit and to the disadvantage of the ordinary white man.|$|E
25|$|Southern California was in {{the midst}} of an unusual drought; in Los Angeles, California, with only 3.21in(82mm) of {{precipitation}} in 2006–2007, it was the driest year on record. The combination of wind, heat, and dryness turned the chaparral into fire fuel. Officials believed that some of the fires generated their own winds, similar to the Oakland <b>Firestorm</b> <b>of</b> 1991. The effects of the smoke were felt as far away as Brentwood, California (in the East Bay, near Stockton), where it impacted local weather. The high-speed Santa Ana winds also rendered the use of dropping water from fire fighting aircraft inefficient; until such winds abate, most payloads of water are just dispersed by the wind over an area so large that the water evaporates before it can reach a large fire on the ground.|$|E
25|$|In May 1999 the Board of Alderman {{selected}} Sansone Development over Landside Resources for redevelopment of McKnight and Manchester. In October Sansone {{withdrew from}} the project. Sansone told Rock Hill later that year it wanted to scale back the development area from 25 acres to 16, just the northwest corner. After the city reopening the bid process Rock Hill agreed in April 2000 to allow Sansone to develop 16 acres, financed by up to $7 million in tax-increment financing. Sansone withdrew its proposal again in September 2000 citing city delays that meant surrounding development projects had progressed so much as to make the 16-acre proposal infeasible. The city re-bid the projects and received 40-acre plans from Regency Realty and THF Realty and an additional 25-acre plan from Regency. In April 2001 both developers retracted their bids amid a <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> resident opposition against the proposals.|$|E

25|$|Much of Tobin's {{presidency}} was consumed by a long-running and sometimes physically violent jurisdictional {{battle with the}} National Union of United Brewery Workmen. The Teamsters had challenged the Brewery Workmen's right to organize beer wagon drivers in 1903 and 1905. At Tobin's insistence, in 1907 the AFL revoked the Brewery Workers' charter, but a <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from local unions around the country led the AFL to reinstate the charter in 1909. In 1933, the AFL Executive Council agreed to strip the brewery workers' union, {{now known as the}} United Brewery Workers, of the beer drivers. The United Brewery Workers filed suit in federal court in 1936 seeking to bar their suspension and the transfer of workers to the Teamsters. As the case worked its way to the Supreme Court of the United States the AFL attempted to mediate the dispute to no avail. The Supreme Court found in the AFL's favor, and the United Brewery Workers were suspended from the AFL.|$|E
25|$|Maxis {{went public}} in 1995 with revenue of US$38 million. The stock reached $50 a share and then dropped as Maxis posted a loss. EA bought Maxis in June 1997. Wright had been {{thinking}} about making a virtual doll house ever since the early 1990s, similar to SimCity but focused on individual people; after losing his home during the Oakland <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> 1991, he was inspired to turn his experiences of rebuilding his life into a game. Sims would be based on Wright's focus on building homes, which came from inspiration he found first-hand. Wright, was even sure to include many fires in the game, which were extra difficult for the player to extinguish. Themes like carpentry, home construction, and bare ground in need of landscaping, are common throughout the game. Originally conceived of as an architectural design game called Home Tactics, Wright's idea changed when someone suggested the player should be rated on the quality of life experience by the homeowners. It was a difficult idea to sell to EA, because already 40% of Maxis's employees had been laid off.|$|E
25|$|In June 1870, Flagler and Rockefeller formed Standard Oil of Ohio, which rapidly {{became the}} most {{profitable}} refiner in Ohio. Standard Oil grew {{to become one of}} the largest shippers of oil and kerosene in the country. The railroads were fighting fiercely for traffic and, in an attempt to create a cartel to control freight rates, formed the South Improvement Company in collusion with Standard and other oil men outside the main oil centers. The cartel received preferential treatment as a high-volume shipper, which included not just steep rebates of up to 50% for their product but also rebates for the shipment of competing products. Part of this scheme was the announcement of sharply increased freight charges. This touched off a <b>firestorm</b> <b>of</b> protest from independent oil well owners, including boycotts and vandalism, which eventually led to the discovery of Standard Oil's part in the deal. A major New York refiner, Charles Pratt and Company, headed by Charles Pratt and Henry H. Rogers, led the opposition to this plan, and railroads soon backed off.
