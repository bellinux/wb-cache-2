60|$|Now, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I did {{for that}} man? He {{was on a}} {{downward}} path, and I rescued him. But all I {{got out of it}} was a watermelon.|$|E
6000|$|... '"No," [...] I said. [...] "You've {{taken my}} {{men out of}} my command. I should only be your butcher if I killed him now." [...] <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I meant?' Parnesius turned to Dan.|$|E
2500|$|... <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> kind of {{wild ass}} (tomb) caught Bahram / Bahram caught?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{guess you}} are--any way, {{if you go}} on as you're <b>doing.</b> <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I {{consider}} it prudent to write off the value of your property?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Between seven-thirty and {{arriving}} here," [...] he said, drawing him on one side--"quick! Tell me, whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> <b>What</b> opportunities {{were there}} of stealing the paper, and by whom?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not with Wetzel here," [...] {{answered}} Col. Zane. [...] "Betty, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> your--" [...] he began, {{turning to}} his sister, {{but when he}} saw her white and miserable face he said no more.|$|E
6000|$|... "Senseless beings! It must {{be covered}} directly. It is a desight {{to the whole}} room. Here!" [...] and {{he went out to}} the carpenter, who was {{universal}} builder to the village, and was laying down the stair carpet. [...] "Here, Hewlett, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> you have done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will recollect, then, that Mrs. Inglethorp wrote a very {{distinctive}} hand, {{and left}} large clear spaces between her words. But {{if you look}} at the date at the top of the letter you will notice that 'July 17th' is quite different in this respect. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I mean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Father, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they said?" [...] he cried, trembling. [...] "Did <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they {{dared to}} say? I didn't {{understand}} it at first. I read it half through before I broke the window." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{a monstrous}} fine girl {{that is in}} the lodgings over the milliner's," [...] one of these three promenaders remarked to the other; [...] "Gad, Crawley, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a wink she gave me as I passed?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Him! Well, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> he <b>did,</b> mum?

6000|$|... 'You're acting all {{fair and}} above-board by me,' he said: 'and, before I take your money, I'll {{do the same}} by you. Look here, {{this is how it}} stands. You can have a bed all to {{yourself}} for five shillings; but you can't have more than a half-share of the room it stands in. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I mean, young gentleman?' ...|$|E
6000|$|L. Nonsense, Lucilla! do {{you think}} the {{universe}} is bound to look consistent to a girl of fifteen? Look up at your own room window; --you can just see it from where you sit. I'm glad that it is left open, as it ought to be, in so fine a day. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a black spot it looks, in the sunlighted wall? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're acting all {{fair and}} aboveboard by me," [...] he said, [...] "and, before I take your money, I'll {{do the same}} by you. Look here; {{this is how it}} stands.

5000|$|... “Touchdown! My God, a touchdown! We {{threw it}} to Haynes! We just stuffed them with five seconds left! My God Almighty, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> he <b>did?</b> David Greene just {{straightened}} up and we snuck the fullback over! … we just stepped on their face with a hobnailed boot and broke their nose! We just crushed their face!”—calling Bulldog quarterback David Greene’s game-winning touchdown pass to Verron Haynes against Tennessee in 2001.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have <b>seen</b> him! And <b>you</b> only {{arrived in}} France last night. Where <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> him? <b>What</b> has {{happened}} to him?' She gripped me by the wrist in her anxiety.|$|R
6000|$|Kate, waiting impatiently in her turn, {{met him at}} the door. [...] "Well, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> her? <b>What</b> <b>did</b> she say?" [...] Her {{voice rose}} in excitement, for she {{perceived}} unusual gravity in the lines of his face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{it means}} if {{anything}} happens something else is sure to happen," [...] said the Story Girl. [...] "I'll illustrate. There's Mrs. Murphy. She never had a proposal in her life till she was forty, {{and then she had}} three in the one week, and she was so flustered she took the wrong one and has been sorry ever since. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it means now?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My niece has her faults of {{temper and}} her failings of judgment," [...] he said. [...] "But she has one atoning quality (among many others) which ought to make--and which I believe will make--the {{happiness}} of your married life. In the popular phrase, Blanche is as true as steel. Once her friend, always her friend. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I am coming to? She has {{said nothing about}} it, Arnold; but she has not yielded one inch in her resolution to reunite herself to Miss Silvester. One of the first questions {{you will have to}} determine, after to-morrow, will be the question of whether you do, or not, sanction your wife in attempting to communicate with her lost friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|What! do you thrust your common {{offenders}} {{against the}} police {{discipline of the}} town, into such holes as these? Do men and women, against whom no crime is proved, lie here all night in perfect darkness, surrounded by the noisome vapours which encircle that flagging lamp you light us with, and breathing this filthy and offensive stench! Why, such indecent and disgusting dungeons as these cells, would bring disgrace upon the most despotic empire in the world! Look at them, man - you, who see them every night, and keep the keys. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they are? Do you know how drains are made below the streets, and wherein these human sewers differ, except in being always stagnant? ...|$|E
5000|$|Now, Her Imperial Majesty has {{returned}} {{the power to}} her son. Your Royal Highness should return to your mansion. Why are you still interfering with government. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happened to Lü Chan (呂產) and Lü Lu (呂祿)? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{that has}} to do with it? Then let me show you.|$|R
25|$|Lithuanian has no {{grammatical}} {{category of}} animacy. Pronouns (including personal ones jis, ji, jie, jos (he, she, they)) replace any noun, regardless {{if it is}} not animate (people, animals, objects etc.). Whom <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> and <b>What</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?</b> both translate as Ką tu matei?; Something is there and Somebody is there both translate as Ten kažkas yra.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thanks," [...] he said, taking it. [...] "Yes, here it is. I wish to {{read you}} this passage, Connie: 'Now they began {{to go down the}} hill into the Valley of Humiliation. It was a steep hill, and their way was slippery, but they were very careful, so they got down pretty well. Then said Mr. Great- heart, We need not be afraid in this Valley, for here is nothing to hurt us, unless we procure it for ourselves. It is true that Christian did here meet with Apollyon, with whom he also had a sore combat; but that fray was the fruit of those slips that he got in his going down the hill; for they that get slips there must look for combats here.' <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I mean, Connie?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And is that Gerard's daughter?" [...] {{said the}} weaver's wife. [...] "Only {{think what it}} is to gain two pounds a-week, and bring up your daughters in that way--instead of such shameless husseys as our Harriet! But with such wages one can do anything. What have you there, Warner? Is that tea? Oh! I should like some tea. I do think tea would do me some good. I have quite a longing for it. Run down, Warner, and ask them to let us have a kettle of hot water. It is better than all the fire in the world. Amelia, my dear, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> they have sent us. Plenty to eat. Tell Maria all about it. You are good girls; you will never be like that infamous Harriet. When you earn wages you will give them to your poor mother and baby, won't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{had no time}} then {{to ask him to}} {{give the}} full story of this Knox, much less to hear him tell it me; but, as it is usual in such cases, when one begins to be a little touched, I turned short with him. [...] "Why then, friend William," [...] said I, [...] "what would you have us <b>do?</b> <b>You</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> {{condition}} we are in, and what is before us; something must be done, and that immediately." [...] "Why," [...] says William, [...] "I'll tell thee what thou shalt do; first, cause a white flag to be hanged out, as they do to us, and man out the longboat and pinnace with as many men as they can well stow, to handle their arms, and let me go with them, and thou shalt see what we will do. If I miscarry, thou mayest be safe; and I will also tell thee, that if I do miscarry, it shall be my own fault, and thou shalt learn wit by my folly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{why were}} you so harsh with me when I wanted you to marry her? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> now <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done?</b> Look at her, and what she might have been. Look at yourself, and what you might have been. Had <b>you</b> <b>done</b> that, <b>you</b> might have been my heir in everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, the convents, the convents!" [...] {{cried the}} Countess with a flutter of her ruffles. [...] "Speak {{to me of}} the convents! You may learn {{anything}} there; I'm a convent-flower myself. I don't pretend to be good, but the nuns <b>do.</b> Don't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> I mean?" [...] she went on, appealing to Isabel.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, it won't,' said Maisie, {{putting down}} the teacups with a clatter to reassure herself. 'And I mean to <b>do</b> it. Can't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a {{beautiful}} thing it would make?' ...|$|R
60|$|In {{the mean}} time {{look at the}} change which {{has taken place in}} the water to which we have applied heat--it is losing its fluid state. You may tell this by two or three circumstances. I have covered the mouth of this glass flask, in which water is boiling, with a watch-glass. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> happens? It rattles away like a valve chattering, because the steam rising from the boiling water sends the valve up and down, and forces itself out, and so makes it clatter. You can very easily {{perceive}} that the flask is quite full of steam, or else it would not force its way out. You see, also, that the flask contains a substance very much larger than the water, for it fills the whole of the flask over and over again, and there it is blowing away into the air; and yet you cannot observe any great diminution in the bulk of the water, which shews you that its change of bulk is very great when it becomes steam.|$|E
6000|$|... "Turn {{your chair}} around towards me," [...] she invited. [...] "This is the hour I like best of any during the day. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a {{beautiful}} view I {{have of the}} Houses of Parliament? And there across the river, behind that mist, the cesspool begins. Sometimes I lie here and think. I see right into Bermondsey and Rotherhithe and all those places and think out {{the lives of the}} people as they are being lived. Then I look through those wonderful windows there--how they glitter in the sunshine, don't they!--and I think I hear the men speak whom they have sent to plead their cause. Some Demosthenes from Tower Hill exhausts himself with phrase-making, shouts himself into a perspiration, drawing lurid, pictures of hideous and apparent wrongs, and a hundred or so well-dressed legislators whisper behind the palms of their hands, make their plans for the evening and trot into their appointed lobbies like sheep when the division bell rings. It is the most tragical epitome of inadequacy the world has ever known." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now {{with this}} wand I gently touch this egg which {{is lying on}} the square of cloth. I do not believe {{you can see what}} has {{happened}} to this egg, but I will tell you. There is a little line, like a hair, entirely around it. Now that line has become a crack. Now you can see it, I know. It grows wider and wider! Look! The shell of the egg is separating in the middle. The whole egg slightly moves. Do you notice that? Now you can see something yellow showing itself between the two parts of the shell. See! It is moving a good deal, and the two halves of the shell are separating more and more. And now out tumbles this queer little object. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> it is? It is a poor, weak, little chick, not able to stand, but alive--alive! You can all perceive that it is alive. Now you can see that it is standing on its feet, feebly enough, but still standing.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{your mind}} is dark. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> have <b>done.</b> In our religion, Emily, {{forgiveness}} is sure, not after penitence, but with repentance." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it won't," [...] said Maisie, {{putting down}} the teacups with a clatter to reassure herself. [...] "And I mean to <b>do</b> it. Can't <b>you</b> <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a {{beautiful}} thing it would make?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "How? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> still ask? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> not <b>see</b> <b>what</b> a blind tool {{you have}} been in their crafty hands? In name at least you are king, and your {{signature}} is binding upon my subjects. Have you not brought them back from exile by one royal decree, whilst by another you have dispersed the Parliament that was assembled to attaint them of treason?" ...|$|R
