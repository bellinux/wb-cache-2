5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn down, and the transition from the <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E
5|$|To this dreadful monster the effluvium of {{the weasel}} is fatal, {{a thing that}} has been tried with success, for kings have often desired to see its body when killed; so true is it that it has pleased Nature {{that there should be}} nothing without its antidote.

5|$|The 1967 match {{continued}} {{the trend of}} American victories, as the United States won 23½–8½ at Champions Golf Club. Unlike in previous years, the 1969 match was much closer. The match {{came down to the}} last <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> final singles match between American Jack Nicklaus and British golfer Tony Jacklin. Nicklaus made his putt, which left Jacklin with a putt to tie the match. Despite this, Nicklaus conceded the putt, picking up Jacklin's ball marker. As a result their match was tied, as was the contest at 16–16. The United States won again in 1971, beating Great Britain 18½–13½. The 1973 match was the first held in Scotland at Muirfield. The outcome remained the same as Great Britain lost 19–13. The 1975 match at Laurel Valley Golf Club was similar with the United States winning 21–11. The format changed again in 1977, as matches were reduced by nearly a third leaving 20 points available. The changed requested by Great Britain & Ireland did little to change the outcome, as the United States won 12½–7½. Golfers from continental Europe were allowed to compete {{for the first time in}} 1979. There was another change to the format, the first two days now consisted of eight foursomes and fourballs, with twelve singles matches on the final day. Again, the changes had little effect on the outcome as the United States won 17–11.|$|E

25|$|The Duchal estates were {{acquired}} from the Lyles by John Porterfield in 1544.

As {{a result of these}} religious sympathies, the estate was sequestered by the Crown in 1684 and the men of the Porterfield family arrested; it was however returned following the Glorious Revolution.|$|E

25|$|At the 2006 Open Championship, Woods almost {{exclusively}} used long irons {{off the tee}} (he hit driver only one time the entire week—the 16th <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first round), he missed just four fairways all week (hitting the fairway 92% of the time), and his score of −18 to par (three eagles, 19 birdies, 43 pars, and seven bogeys) was just one off of his major championship record −19, set at St Andrews in 2000 (since eclipsed by Jason Day). The victory was an emotional one for Woods, who dedicated his play to his father's memory.|$|E
25|$|Dustin Johnson and Henrik Stenson both posted {{rounds of}} 65 (−5) {{to share the}} lead after the first round. Johnson {{recorded}} four birdies on his back-nine and {{did not make a}} bogey until the par-3 9th, his 18th <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> round. Stenson, meanwhile, birdied four of his last five holes to tie Johnson for the lead. Jordan Spieth, the reigning Masters champion, was three strokes back after a 68. Three-time champion Tiger Woods opened with a round of 80 (+10), his worst score ever at the U.S. Open. Brian Campbell, a senior at the University of Illinois, was low amateur after a round of 67 (−3), two behind the lead.|$|E
25|$|Bill Krohn {{has noted}} that Bass's 48 story board panels for the scene {{introduced}} all the key aspects of the final shower murder scene – most notably, {{the fact that the}} attacker appears as a silhouette, close-ups of a slashing knife, the shower curtain torn down, a shot of the shower head from below, Marion's desperate outstretched arm, and the famous shot of the transition from the drain <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bathtub to Marion Crane's dead eye. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of Bass's iris titles for Vertigo. Krohn also concludes that Bass did not literally direct the shower scene, proving Hitchcock's presence on the set throughout the shooting of that scene.|$|E

25|$|McIlroy took a month {{off from}} {{competitive}} golf. At The Open Championship he struggled in tough weather over a difficult layout at Royal St George's Golf Club, failing {{to contend with}} the conditions. He was again a non-factor at the PGA Championship at Atlanta Athletic Club after injuring his wrist on the 3rd <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first round after attempting to play a stroke from behind a tree root. McIlroy {{went on to win the}} Lake Malaren Shanghai Masters in a playoff against Anthony Kim. In November, he finished tied for 4th at the WGC-HSBC Champions to move to a then career high of number two in the Official World Golf Ranking. In December 2011, he won the UBS Hong Kong Open by two strokes.|$|E
25|$|The score {{achieved}} {{for each}} and every <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> round or tournament is added to produce the total score, and the player with the lowest score wins in stroke play. Stroke play is the game most commonly played by professional golfers. If there is a tie after the regulation number of holes in a professional tournament, a playoff takes place between all tied players. Playoffs either are sudden death or employ a pre-determined number of holes, anywhere from three to a full 18. In sudden death, a player who scores lower on a hole than all of his opponents wins the match. If at least two players remain tied after such a playoff using a pre-determined number of holes, then play continues in sudden death format, where {{the first player to}} win a hole wins the tournament.|$|E
25|$|Faldo won {{his second}} major {{championship}} at the 1989 Masters. Starting his fourth round five shots off the lead held by Ben Crenshaw, Faldo's {{final round of}} 65 (consisting of eight birdies, nine pars and one bogey) was the low round of the tournament and enabled him {{to get into a}} playoff with Scott Hoch. Displaying some brilliant putting in his final round, Faldo holed a 50-foot birdie putt on the first hole and followed this up with birdies on the 2nd, 4th and 7th holes. On the back nine, Faldo holed birdie putts of 12 feet at the 13th, 5 feet at the 14th, 15 feet (with an 8-foot break) at the 16th, and 30 feet at the 17th. On the first <b>hole</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ensuing sudden-death playoff, Hoch missed a 2-foot par putt that would have won him the tournament. On the 2nd playoff hole, amid the growing evening darkness, Faldo holed a 25-foot birdie putt to win the tournament.|$|E
