5|$|P. R. Brown {{directed}} this video, which premiered on VH1 Classic on 8 August 2006. There are {{similarities between}} the video for Meat Loaf's version of the song, and that the video for that of Celine Dion, with Meat Loaf being <b>haunted</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> memory of his lover. It is structured differently, however, with the story being told through flashback. Shots when Raven's character is alive have a distinct yellow tint, with a darker, blue tint for those after her death. Whereas the motorcyclist dies before the first verse in the Dion version, Raven's crash and resulting death is not shown until the final chorus. Meat Loaf becomes angry with Raven because the ghost of Raven's former lover appears at a masquerade ball they are attending (some reviewers have compared this to the Stanley Kubrick film Eyes Wide Shut).|$|E
