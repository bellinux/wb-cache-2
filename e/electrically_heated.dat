5|$|Although {{rainfall}} is low, Sismiut has abundant natural {{supplies of}} fresh, drinkable surface water, collected from a reservoir under Alanngorsuaq. Water is also pumped to the waterworks from another lake around 2.5 kilometers {{away in the}} mountains. The water mains are preinsulated and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> to supply the residents during the winter months. The water supply network is capable of producing some 882,000 cubic meters of water per year; two water-supplying lakes by the town have a combined annual minimum capacity of more than 7.2 million cubic meters.|$|E
25|$|The {{alternative}} is the Pirani gauge, which operates {{in a similar}} way, over approximately the same pressure range, but is only a 2-terminal device, sensing the change in resistance with temperature of a thin <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> wire, rather than using a thermocouple.|$|E
25|$|In 1865, John Tyndall {{described}} {{radiation from}} <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> filaments and from carbon arcs as visible and invisible. Tyndall spectrally decomposed the radiation {{by use of}} a rock salt prism, which passed heat as well as visible rays, and measured the radiation intensity {{by means of a}} thermopile.|$|E
50|$|The {{globally}} competitive RPL refinery {{was commissioned}} in 36 months. RPL contracted several companies having expertise in engineering construction and refining like Bechtel, UOP LLC and Foster Wheeler amongst others.

50|$|In {{order to}} <b>electrically</b> <b>heat</b> glass, a {{microscopic}} tin(II) oxide coating {{is applied to}} a pane of ordinary float glass. This coating is perfectly transparent and conducts electricity. An electrical current is supplied by two busbars located {{on opposite sides of}} the glass. The electrical resistance of the Tin Oxide coating produces heat energy. This heat radiates from the glass in the form of infrared energy. The busbars are typically connected to a power control unit that regulates the flow of electricity and thus the temperature of the glass.|$|R

25|$|During World War II, {{a number}} of Swiss steam {{shunting}} locomotives were modified to use <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> boilers, consuming around 480kW of power collected from an overhead line with a pantograph. These locomotives were significantly less efficient than electric ones; they were used because Switzerland had access to plentiful hydroelectricity, and suffered from a shortage of coal because of the war.|$|E
25|$|Fog (usually {{from water}} particles) is created with an {{ultrasonic}} piezoelectric nebulizer. The fog is transported inside the wind tunnel (preferably of the closed circuit and closed test section type). An <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> grid is inserted before the test section, which evaporates the water particles at its vicinity, thus forming fog sheets. The fog sheets function as streamlines over the test model when illuminated by a light sheet.|$|E
25|$|The {{mirror is}} {{aluminized}} by {{placing it in}} a vacuum chamber with <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> tungsten or nichrome coils that can evaporate aluminum. In a vacuum, the hot aluminum atoms travel in straight lines. When they hit {{the surface of the}} mirror, they cool and stick. Some mirror coating shops then evaporate a layer of quartz onto the mirror, whereas others expose it to pure oxygen or air in an oven so that the mirror will form a tough, clear layer of aluminum oxide.|$|E
50|$|The {{method of}} {{screening}} {{has been linked}} to the early Egyptians who used the process to separate basic minerals by using a mesh that had equal openings. This idea fell down through the ages and developed into a series of European patents around 1924, when the thought of <b>electrically</b> <b>heating</b> the wire cloth for screens was considered. This was the first attempt at eliminating screen blinding (when the material being processed (clay, dirt, etc.) clogs the holes in the screen) by using heat, and it proved that the surface tension from blinding was reduced when heat was introduced.|$|R
50|$|Towel dryers can be {{made from}} {{different}} metals such as steel, stainless steel, or aluminum. In some types brass or copper is used. The finish can be in chrome plating, polished steel or lacquer. Dryers can be <b>heated</b> <b>electrically</b> (<b>heating</b> cartridge or heating cable) or by circulating hot water (connected to the central heating). Often a combination of the methods is used. In these cases the dryer is heated by hot water in winter time and by electricity in the summer. A towel dryer, with high output, can also serve as a radiator in a small bathroom.|$|R

25|$|The engines were unusually quiet {{because the}} {{exhausts}} were muffled by the General Electric turbo-superchargers on the twin Allison V12s. There were early problems with cockpit temperature regulation; pilots were often too {{hot in the}} tropical sun as the canopy could not be fully opened without severe buffeting and were often too cold in northern Europe and at high altitude, as {{the distance of the}} engines from the cockpit prevented easy heat transfer. Later variants received modifications (such as <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> flight suits) to solve these problems.|$|E
25|$|The Allgemeine Elektricitäts-Gesellschaft (A.E.G.) G.IV {{was derived}} from the earlier G.III. Designed as a {{tactical}} bomber, the relatively modern technology included onboard radios and <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> suits for the crew. Unlike the other German bombers such as the Gotha and the Friedrichshafen, the AEG featured an all-metal, welded-tube frame, making it a more rugged aircraft. Well equipped with armament, although the rear gunner’s cockpit was {{on the top of the}} fuselage, the position was equipped with a hinged window in the floor for viewing and fending off pursuing aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The cockpit {{design of}} the TBM strives to be {{user-friendly}} and as uncomplicated to operate as possible. For pilot convenience, an automatic fuel selector automatically switches between fuel tanks periodically to effortlessly maintain fuel balance throughout flight; manual selection of fuel tanks is also possible, which remains overseen by a low fuel warning system. The ice protection system is as automated as possible, the windshield being <b>electrically</b> <b>heated,</b> the air inlet being kept warm by engine exhaust and the de-ice boots automatically cycling once activated. The electrically actuated flaps are monitored by a sophisticated split-flap protection system to prevent asymmetric deployment. An onboard air data computer calculates various values to support the pilot, such as the aircraft's true air speed, wind, and power advisory notices based upon current external temperature and altitude.|$|E

25|$|Thermospray {{was first}} {{developed}} {{as a way to}} effectively remove solvent and vaporize samples more easily. This method involves the liquid sample from the LC flowing through an <b>electrically</b> <b>heated</b> vaporizer that simply heats the sample, removing any solvent and therefore putting the sample in the gas phase. Electrospray ionization (ESI) is similar to thermospray in the principle of removing the liquid solvent from the sample as much as possible, creating charged sample molecules either in small droplets or in gas form. Studies have shown that ESI can be as much as ten times more sensitive than other ionization methods coupled to LC. The spray methods are particularly useful considering that non-volatile samples can be analyzed easily through this method since the sample is not itself turned into a gas, the liquid is simply removed, pushing the sample into a gaseous or mist phase.|$|E

40|$|Relaminarization of a {{turbulent}} boundary layer in air on a flat plate is demonstrated experimentally using localized surface heating. Localized heating is achieved by <b>electrically</b> <b>heating</b> a wire embedded in a thermally insulated substrate (Space Shuttle Tile) on the surface. The stability of the flow downstream of the applied control point increases with decreasing stream temperature in the flow direction. The mean and perturbation velocity profiles without control show that the flow is turbulent. With control, these profiles sequentially change from intermittently turbulent to a fully laminar state. In the relaminarization stage, the turbulent energy is dissipated by molecular transport due to viscous and conductivity mechanisms. The new profile adjusts to a lower Reynolds number based on the momentum thickness {{than that of the}} previous turbulent state...|$|R

500|$|There are {{different}} views {{about when the}} Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration came to an end. Shackleton's Endurance expedition is {{sometimes referred to as}} the last Antarctic expedition of the Heroic Age. Other chroniclers extend the era to the date of Shackleton's death, 5 January 1922, treating the Shackleton–Rowett, or Quest expedition, during which Shackleton died, as the final chapter of the Age. According to Margery and James Fisher, Shackleton's biographers: [...] "If it were possible to draw a distinct dividing line between what has been called the Heroic Age of Antarctic Exploration and the Mechanical Age, the Shackleton–Rowett expedition might make as good a point as any at which to draw such a line".

2500|$|A {{less common}} {{strategy}} {{is to use a}} hot reference junction.
