25|$|The Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority {{has begun}} to {{gradually}} phase out the mobile lounge system for inter-terminal passenger movements {{in favor of the}} AeroTrain, an underground people mover which currently operates to Concourses A, B and C, as well as underground pedestrian walkway tunnels (now in service to concourse A/B). The mobile lounges are still used to transport passengers directly from the main terminal to Concourse D. Plane mates also remain in use to disembark international passengers and carry them to the International Arrivals Building, as well as to convey passengers to and from aircraft on <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> (i.e., those parked remotely on the apron without access to jet bridges).|$|E
500|$|Patton chose Steve Henry, {{a surgeon}} and county {{commissioner}} from Louisville, {{as his running}} mate. His major opposition in the Democratic primary came from secretary of state Bob Babbage and President Pro Tempore of the Kentucky Senate John [...] "Eck" [...] Rose. Although sitting governor Brereton Jones did not officially endorse Patton, Rose referred to Jones as Patton's [...] "mentor". Rose charged that, like Jones, Patton would not take a <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> on the issues; referring to a nickname given to Jones in the 1991 campaign, Rose remarked [...] "If you have liked Jell-O Jones, then {{you are going to}} be in a position to love Puddin' Paul Patton." [...] Particularly odious to Rose was that Patton had publicly supported collective wage bargaining for public employees, but had declared that he would not fight for it in the upcoming 1996 legislative session. Though Babbage and Rose were political veterans and solid campaigners, Patton won 152,203votes in the primary, well over the 40percent needed to avoid a runoff. Babbage ran second with 81,352votes and Rose was third with 71,740votes. Two other candidates split the remaining 33,344votes.|$|E
2500|$|Wilson {{had earlier}} downplayed Germany's guilt in {{starting}} {{the war by}} calling for [...] "peace without victory", but he had taken an increasingly <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> at Paris and rejected advice to soften the treaty's treatment of Germany. In a reversal of his earlier position, in summer 1919 Wilson repeatedly stressed Germany's guilt, saying the treaty, [...] "seeks to punish {{one of the greatest}} wrongs ever done in history, the wrong which Germany sought to do to the world and to civilization; and there ought to be no weak purpose with regard to the application of the punishment. She attempted an intolerable thing, and she must be made to pay for the attempt." ...|$|E

50|$|Capacity: 10,884The Matthew <b>Harding</b> <b>Stand,</b> {{previously}} {{known as}} the North Stand, is along the north edge of the pitch. In 1939, a small two storied North Stand including seating was erected. It was originally intended to span the entire northern end, but the outbreak of World War II and its aftermath compelled the club to keep the stand small. It was demolished and replaced by open terracing for standing supporters in 1976. The North Terrace was closed in 1993 and the present North Stand of two tiers (the Matthew <b>Harding</b> <b>Stand)</b> was then constructed at that end.|$|R
2500|$|In {{response}} to Yarhouse's paper, Jack Drescher argued that [...] "any putative ethical obligation to refer a patient for reparative therapy is outweighed by a stronger ethical obligation to keep patients away from mental health practitioners {{who engage in}} questionable clinical practices". Chuck Bright wrote that refusing to endorse a procedure that [...] "has been deemed unethical and potentially harmful by most medical and nearly every professional psychotherapy regulating body cannot be justifiably identified as prohibiting client self-determination". Some commentators, recommending a <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> against the practice, have found therapy inconsistent with a psychologist's ethical duties because [...] "it is more ethical to let a client continue to struggle honestly with her or his identity than to collude, even peripherally, with a practice that is discriminatory, oppressive, and ultimately ineffective in its own stated ends". They argue that clients who request it do so out of social pressure and internalized homophobia, pointing to evidence that rates of depression, anxiety, {{alcohol and drug abuse}} and suicidal feelings are roughly doubled in those who undergo therapy.|$|E
2500|$|Fortunately, the lull in {{hostilities}} {{during the}} winter provided an opportunity for negotiations, and direct confrontation was avoided. As early as August 1857, Brigham Young had written to Thomas L. Kane of Pennsylvania asking for help. Kane {{was a man of}} some political prominence who had been helpful to the Mormons in their westward migration and later political controversies. In December, Kane contacted President Buchanan and offered to mediate between the Mormons and the federal government. In Buchanan's State of the Union address earlier in the month, he had taken a <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> against the Mormon rebellion, and had actually asked Congress to enlarge the size of the regular army to deal with the crisis. However, in his conversation with Kane, Buchanan worried that the Mormons might destroy Johnston's Army at severe political cost to himself, and stated that he would pardon the Latter-day Saints for their actions if they would submit to government authority. He therefore granted Kane unofficial permission to attempt mediation, although he held little hope for the success of negotiations. Upon approval of his mission by the President, Kane immediately started for Utah. During the heavy winter of 1857–1858, he traveled under the alias [...] "Dr. Osborne" [...] over 3,000+ miles from the East coast to Utah, first by ship to Panama, crossing the isthmus via the newly constructed (1855) Panama Railway, and then taking a second ship to San Francisco. Upon learning that the Sierra passes were blocked for the winter, he immediately took a ship to San Pedro, the unimproved harbor for what is now Los Angeles. He was met there by Mormons who took him overland through San Bernardino and Las Vegas, to Salt Lake City on the strenuous southern branch of the California Trail, arriving in February 1858.|$|E

In 2009, a dedicated bulk minerals export precinct was established at Berth 29, Port Adelaide. Exports of mineral sands, zinc concentrates, copper concentrates, sulphur and fertilisers/phosphate rock were initially catered for. Iron ore was first exported from the precinct from IMX Resources' Cairn Hill mine in December 2010. Flinders Ports also developed 25,000 square metres of <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> to accommodate the storage and handling of mineral sands. Mineral sands exporters include Cristal Mining.|$|E

5000|$|The airport {{once had}} an unusual {{terminal}} resembling a pioneer log cabin. The terminal was completely rebuilt between 2009 and 2014. The new terminal, designed by Gensler, still blends with the unique surroundings {{of the national}} park with exposed wood, fireplaces, and nature photography throughout. The park limited {{the height of the}} terminal building to 18 feet. [...] The terminal design received an American Institute of Architects Honor Award in 2014. The airport currently has 9 <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> gates and 3 baggage carousels. Jackson Hole Airport does not have jet bridges so passengers board aircraft via airstairs.

50|$|At Eastern Beach {{there is}} a sports ground (Rogers Park) named after Vic Rogers, a long serving local member of the former Manukau County Council in the 1950s and 60s, is used for junior soccer and a tennis club and courts. On the rocky area, named Grangers Point, between Big and Little Bucklands Beach is a yacht club rooms for centre board boats, boat ramp and hauling out <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> which was built in 1962. In 2007 a huge holding tank was {{constructed}} under the <b>hard</b> <b>stand</b> to hold the surplus sewage from beach side houses. Eastern Beach has a large Christian Youth camp which hires out its facilities to schools. At one stage the beach had three garages but all have closed now. Until the 1980s Bucklands Beach had its own post office, next to the community centre hall but this was shut down and removed by barge to Waiheke Island. In the 1950s Miss Tonks ran a library from a small building, {{that had previously been}} a garage, on the steep frontage of her property at the North end of Bucklands Beach Road near the Community hall. This little building about 4m x 3m, was so frequently crowded with customers they could barely walk around. Midway between the two restaurants at big Bucklands Beach was a dairy and hall complex called Westend (named after the farm {{at the tip of the}} peninsula). The hall was used for local dances in the 1930s and 1940s during the summer holidays.|$|E
