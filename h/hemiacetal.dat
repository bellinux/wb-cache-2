25|$|In the acetalisation reaction, under acidic or basic conditions, {{an alcohol}} {{adds to the}} {{carbonyl}} group and a proton is transferred to form a <b>hemiacetal.</b> Under acidic conditions, the <b>hemiacetal</b> and the alcohol can further react to form an acetal and water. Simple hemiacetals are usually unstable, although cyclic ones such as glucose can be stable. Acetals are stable, but revert to the aldehyde {{in the presence of}} acid. Aldehydes can react with water to form hydrates, R−CH(OH)2. These diols are stable when strong electron withdrawing groups are present, as in chloral hydrate. The mechanism of formation is identical to <b>hemiacetal</b> formation.|$|E
25|$|The open-chain {{form of a}} {{monosaccharide}} often coexists with {{a closed}} ring form where the aldehyde/ketone carbonyl group carbon (C=O) and hydroxyl group (–OH) react forming a <b>hemiacetal</b> with a new C–O–C bridge.|$|E
25|$|The {{aldehyde}} or ketone {{group of}} a straight-chain monosaccharide will react reversibly with a hydroxyl group {{on a different}} carbon atom to form a <b>hemiacetal</b> or hemiketal, forming a heterocyclic ring with an oxygen bridge between two carbon atoms. Rings with five and six atoms are called furanose and pyranose forms, respectively, and exist in equilibrium with the straight-chain form.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hemiacetals</b> and hemiketals are {{generally}} unstable compounds. In some cases however, stable cyclic <b>hemiacetals</b> and hemiketals, called lactols, {{can be readily}} formed, especially when 5- and 6-membered rings are possible. In this case an intramolecular OH group reacts with the carbonyl group. Glucose and many other aldoses exist as cyclic <b>hemiacetals</b> whereas fructose and similar ketoses exist as cyclic hemiketals. Examples of hemiketals which are stable are OH-CH2-CH2-CH2-C(=O)-CH3,OH-CH2-(CH2)4-C(=O)-CH3.|$|R

40|$|The {{electronic}} cigarette solvents propylene glycol and glycerol {{are known to}} produce toxic byproducts such as formaldehyde, acetaldehyde and acrolein. However, the aerosol toxin yield depends upon a variety of chemical and physical variables. The formaldehyde <b>hemiacetals</b> derived from these solvents were reported as major {{electronic cigarette}} aerosol components by us in 2015. In the study described herein, the formaldehyde <b>hemiacetals</b> were found at higher levels than those of free formaldehyde via an orthogonal sample collection protocol. In addition, the common aldehyde collection methods for electronic cigarettes, such as impingers and sorbent tubes containing DNPH, significantly underestimate the levels of formaldehyde. The {{reason for this is}} that formaldehyde <b>hemiacetals</b> follow other reaction pathways, such as the formation of a less reactive full cyclic acetal catalyzed by the acidity of the DNPH solution and the silica. We found that formaldehyde <b>hemiacetals</b> are a considerable fraction of the total formaldehyde produced in electronic cigarette that cannot be determined accurately by DNPH derivatization methods. Although the health effects of the <b>hemiacetals</b> are not yet known, they warrant further investigation...|$|R
25|$|In the Tishchenko reaction, {{the base}} used is an {{alkoxide}} rather than hydroxide, {{and the product}} is an ester rather than the separate alcohol and carboxylate groups. After the nucleophilic base attacks an aldehyde, the resulting new oxygen anion attacks another aldehyde to give a <b>hemiacetal</b> linkage {{between two of the}} formerly aldehyde-containing reactants rather than undergoing tetrahedral collapse. Eventually tetrahedral collapse does occur, giving the stable ester product.|$|E
25|$|In organic chemistry, {{there can}} {{be more than one}} {{chemical}} compound with the same composition and molecular weight. Generally, these are called isomers. Isomers usually have substantially different chemical properties, may be isolated and do not spontaneously convert to each other. A common example is glucose vs. fructose. The former is an aldehyde, the latter is a ketone. Their interconversion requires either enzymatic or acid-base catalysis. However, there are also tautomers, where isomerization occurs spontaneously, such that a pure substance cannot be isolated into its tautomers. A common example is glucose, which has open-chain and ring forms. One cannot manufacture pure open-chain glucose because glucose spontaneously cyclizes to the <b>hemiacetal</b> form.|$|E
