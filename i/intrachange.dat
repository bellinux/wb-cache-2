40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} biophysical model that {{explains}} the sizes of radiation-induced hprt deletions. METHODS: Key assumptions: (1) Deletions are produced by two DSB that are closer than an interaction distance {{at the time of}} DSB induction; (2) Interphase chromatin is modelled by a biphasic random walk distribution; and (3) Misrejoining of DSB from two separate tracks dominates at low-LET and misrejoining of DSB from a single track dominates at high-LET. RESULTS: The size spectra for radiation-induced total deletions of the hprt gene are calculated. Comparing with the results of Yamada and coworkers for gamma-irradiated human fibroblasts the study finds that an interaction distance of 0. 75 microm will fit both the absolute frequency and the size spectrum of the total deletions. It is also shown that high-LET radiations produce, relatively, more total deletions of sizes below 0. 5 Mb. The model predicts an essential gene to be located between 2 and 3 Mb from the hprt locus towards the centromere. Using the same assumptions and parameters as for evaluating mutation frequencies, a frequency of intra-arm chromosome deletions is calculated that is in agreement with experimental data. CONCLUSIONS: Radiation-induced total-deletion mutations of the human hprt gene and <b>intrachange</b> chromosome aberrations share a common mechanism for their induction...|$|E

40|$|We {{measured}} residual {{cytogenetic damage}} in the progeny of human peripheral blood lymphocytes exposed to 1 GeV/ nucleon iron ions or rays. Arm-specific DNA probes for chromosome 1 were used to detect aberrations {{as a function of}} dose in cells harvested 144 h after exposure. In addition, arm-specific mFISH was applied to samples exposed to a single dose of 2 Gy. These methods allowed the detection of interarm <b>intrachanges</b> (pericentric inversions) in addition to interchanges. The ratio of these types of aberrations (F ratio) has been proposed as a fingerprint of exposure to densely ionizing radiation. The fractions of aberrant cells in the progeny of cells exposed to iron ions were similar to those in the population exposed to rays, possibly because many rearrangements induced by heavy ions ultimately lead to cell death. Simple inter- and <b>intrachanges</b> were also similar, but more complex rearrangements were found in cells that survived after exposure to iron ions. We did not find {{a significant difference in the}} ratio of simple interchanges to simple <b>intrachanges</b> for the two radiation types. However, iron ions induced a much higher frequency of events involving both inter- and <b>intrachanges.</b> We conclude that these complex rearrangements represent a hallmark of exposure to heavy ions and may be responsible of the decrease of the F ratio with increasing LET reported in the literature in some in vitro and in vivo experiments...|$|R
40|$|Interchromosomal {{distributions}} of breakpoints from chromatid-type aberrations induced by gamma rays in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells were analyzed. In most chromosomes the distribution was as expected from chromosome lengths for simple breaks or the respective relative corrected length {{in case of}} exchanges. There were deviations from expectation in a few chromosomes for chromatid breaks, interchanges, intra-arm <b>intrachanges</b> and inter-arm <b>intrachanges.</b> Especially interesting are the results concerning chromosomes 2 and 8, which were more often involved in exchanges than expected. An "exchange phenotype" for these chromosomes is proposed and possible explanations for the nonrandom distribution of chromosome breakpoints are presented...|$|R
40|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{considerable}} interest in identifying cytogenetic biomarkers of radiation exposure that allow both to estimate the dose to which an individual has been exposed and to determine, whether the initial exposure was to low or high LET radiation [1, 2, 3]. Taking proximity effects into account it has been hypothesized that high LET exposure will enhance the yields of intraarm relative to inter-arm <b>intrachanges</b> and <b>intrachanges</b> relative to inter-chromosomal aberrations. However, published data are controversial. To contribute to this issue, we reanalysed 30 data sets generated at GSI (Darmstadt) for human lymphocytes {{as well as for}} Chinese hamster cells (V 79, CHO-K 1, xrs 5). In the experiments cells were exposed in G 1 -phase to heavy ions (C, Ne, Ar, Kr, Fe and Au ions) covering a...|$|R
40|$|The chromosome-type {{exchange}} aberrations {{induced by}} ionizing radiation during the G(0) /G(1) {{phase of the}} cell cycle {{are believed to be}} the result of illegitimate rejoining of chromosome breaks. From numerous studies using chromosome painting, it has emerged that even after a moderate dose of radiation, a substantial fraction of these exchanges is complex. Most of them are derived from the free interaction between the ends of three or more breaks. Other studies have demonstrated that chromosomes occupy distinct territories in the interphase nucleus. Since breaks that are in close proximity have an enhanced interaction probability, it seems likely that after ionizing radiation many of the interacting breaks will be present within one chromosome or chromosome arm. Unfortunately, the majority of these <b>intrachanges</b> remain undetected, even when sophisticated molecular cytogenetic detection methods (i. e. mFISH) are applied to paint all chromosome pairs in distinct colors. In the present paper, we evaluate the limitations of full-color painting for the detection of complex exchanges and the correct interpretations of break interactions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

40|$|Purpose: To {{assess the}} {{chromosomal}} breakpoint distribution in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) after {{exposure to a}} low dose of high linear energy transfer (LET) α-particles using the technique of multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridisation (m-FISH). Materials and methods: Separated PBL were exposed in G 0 to 0. 5 Gy 238 Pu α-particles, stimulated to divide and harvested 48 - 50 hours after exposure. Metaphase cells were assayed by m-FISH and chromosome breaks identified. The observed distribution of breaks were then compared with expected distributions of breaks, calculated {{on the assumption that}} the distribution of breaks is random with regard to either chromosome volume or chromosome surface area. Results: More breaks than expected were observed on chromosomes 2 and 11, however no particular region of either chromosome was identified as significantly contributing to this over-representation. The identification of hot or cold chromosome regions (pter,p,cen,q,qter) varied depending on whether the data were compared according to chromosome volume or surface area. Conclusions: A deviation from randomness in chromosome breakpoint distribution was observed, and this was greatest when data were compared according to the relative surface area of each individual chromosome (or region). The identification of breaks by m-FISH (i. e. more efficient observation of interchanges than <b>intrachanges)</b> and importance of territorial boundaries on interchange formation are thought to contribute to these differences. The significance of the observed non-random distribution of breaks on chromosomes 2 and 11 in relation to chromatin organisation is unclear...|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} has been perfected for enabling good microscope preparations to {{be obtained from}} the larval ganglia of Drosophila melanogaster. This system was then tested with X-rays and an extensive series of data was obtained on the chromosome aberrations induced in the various stages of the cell cycle. —The analysis of the results obtained offers the following points of interest: (1) There exists a difference in radio-sensitivity between the two sexes. The females constantly display a greater frequency of both chromosome and chromatid aberrations. They also display a greater frequency of spontaneous aberrations. (2) In both sexes the overall chromosome damage is greater in cells irradiated in stages G 2 and G 1. These two peaks of greater radiosensitivity are produced by a high frequency of terminal deletions and chromatid exchanges and by a high frequency of dicentrics, respectively. (3) The aberrations are not distributed at random among the various chromosomes. On the average, the Y chromosome is found to be more resistant and the breaks are preferentially localized in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of the X chromosome and of the autosomes. (4) Somatic pairing influences the frequency and type of the chromosome aberrations induced. In this system, such an arrangement of the chromosomes results in a high frequency of exchanges and dicentrics between homologous chromosomes and a low frequency of scorable translocations. Moreover, somatic pairing, probably by preventing the formation of looped regions in the interphase chromosomes, results in the almost total absence of <b>intrachanges</b> at both chromosome and chromatid level...|$|R
