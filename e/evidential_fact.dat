5000|$|The eight {{artists whose}} work was showcased were {{selected}} by curator Henry Bond for their ongoing {{interest in the}} exhibition's key theme: art exploring perceptions of <b>evidential</b> <b>fact</b> particularly {{in the context of}} the crime scene. The art historian Ian Jeffrey wrote,It is the opposite, Exhibit A, to a sensational exhibition, and crystallises a turning in the art world away from the egotistical mode towards impersonality. The egotistical, it admits, is a delusion ... its premises are anonymous, fluent, vertiginous, wary of values. Anything else would emerge as a cliché ... it is, in fact, a properly phenomenological exhibition, one which refuses to differentiate between subject and object, between perception and the moments and occasions of perception. [...] One of the works on view was a slide-installation, shown in a darkened room, by artist Mat Collishaw, which presented the viewer with a rapid-fire sequence of stills of Jodie Foster dancing as she appeared in the [...] "rape scene", in Jonathan Kaplan's 1988 movie The Accused.|$|E
40|$|Questioning {{has often}} {{been the focus of}} {{institutional}} legal discourse research across the domains of police interviews and courtroom interaction both in terms of the institutional participants and the lay respondents (e. g. Drew 1992; Archer 2005; Newbury and Johnson 2006; Tracy and Parks 2012). Though we know much about question design and evidence construction and negotiation from this work, there is more to be learned from cross-domain corpus-based research, particularly in the area of reported speech and quoting in legal discourse. This chapter focuses on pragmatic uses of the verb SAY in police interviewing and cross-examination discourse, using large specialised corpora. Combining insights from previous research on reported speech (Matoesian 2000; Galatolo 2007) in legal discourse and using a cross-corpus approach, we look at how actions of settling on agreed and contested <b>evidential</b> <b>facts</b> are accomplished. We see how patterns of use with SAY are linked to a range of institutional activities: arguing and stance making, doubting and rejecting, time-shifting and framing, which constitute professional activities of shifting and fixing states of knowledge against legal and moral discourses. Construction, acceptance and denial of the verbal “facts” is given “intertextual authority” (Matoesian 2000) by institutional participants: judges and lawyers...|$|R
40|$|Auditors review {{documented}} financial {{figures to}} test for their accuracy and materiality. Lawyers analyze <b>evidential</b> <b>facts</b> and records to build sound legal arguments. These parties work toward a mutual purpose: to present their clients as legitimate and compliant businesses. But {{what happens when the}} concrete facts upon which lawyers and auditors base their work are obscured by their inability to see into the future? In other words, how can these professions conjunctively handle potential future obligations brought about by contingent liabilities? This study will attempt to resolve the tensions that emerge between lawyers and auditors when tasked with estimating the likelihood and financial value of contingent liabilities. It considers the strict regulations set forth by the ABA and FASB and how each side might circumvent the guidelines to allow for better collaboration. Addressing a focal point of contention between the legal and financial professions for decades, this study will also look at past attempts at mediating the conflict as well as current proposals to alter the contingent liability disclosure process. Most importantly, it distinguishes itself from prior research by implementing firsthand arguments from professionals in each field to improve the cooperative landscape. Collectively weighing previously attempted solutions, current regulatory barriers, and professional guidance, this study proposes a three-step solution toward initiating reform between lawyers and auditors to enhance the visibility, precision, and ease of disclosing contingent liabilities...|$|R
40|$|This talk {{reports on}} a joint project with Norry Ogata on the {{semantics}} of Japanese evidentials. Until recently, evidential expressions have not received much attention in the (formal) semantic literature. This situation {{has changed in the}} last few years; influential work by Izvorski (1997) and Faller (2002), for instance, has inspired a good deal of work. The consensus at this point seems to be that evidentials have at least one characteristic in common: they must take widest scope. Even if they appear at the surface to be embedded under negation or modal operators, for instance, they cannot scope under them. In this paper we show that there are languages—namely, for instance, Japanese—in which this characterization does not hold. Many other questions are answered by the literature on evidentials; but many questions remain. Consider, for instance, hearsay evidentials. For instance, for is it enough just to overhear some information, or must one be told directly? Can inference play a role? More generally, since most of the literature on evidentials is oriented to functional and descriptive approaches (with some notable exceptions), a number of questions of interest to semanticists in the formalization of <b>evidential</b> <b>facts</b> are left unaddressed. How does evidential content affect anaphoric relations? Do evidentials block anaphora in a way similar to modals (Roberts, 1989), or not? Can evidentia...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} changes of the New York Code of Pleading and Practice of 1848, so at least the code makers believed, was {{to be found in the}} requirement that there should be stated 2 ̆ 2 in ordinary and concise language 2 ̆ 2 the facts constituting each cause of action or defense. It is true that the common law declaration contained allegations which set forth the pleader 2 ̆ 7 s cause in a general way at least; but the emphasis under the common law system of pleading was placed, not so much on getting the facts on record, but rather upon forcing the opposing parties by their successive pleadings to arrive at a single definite issue. In accordance with the natural tendency of all procedural processes towards standardization and formalism, common law pleading had come in large measure to consist of formal general statements which did not set forth the details of the pleader 2 ̆ 7 s case. The codifiers considered this to be a real and serious defect, and they termed their cure for it 2 ̆ 2 the key of the reform 2 ̆ 2 they were advocating. Elsewhere in their code they adapted the existing equity practice to their purpose. In equity pleading very great detail of the kind termed 2 ̆ 2 evidence 2 ̆ 2 was incorporated in the pleadings, due in part to the rules whereby the plaintiff might force the defendant to a discovery of his proof in his answer, and in part to the general requirement of equity that all the evidence must be made a matter of record. The codifiers concluded that for the blended system they proposed, the <b>evidential</b> <b>facts</b> should be omitted, the ultimate facts, rather than the legal conclusions, should be stated, and the pleadings should not go on until a single formal issue was reached, but should terminate in any event with the reply...|$|R
5000|$|Tillers' {{scholarship}} {{focused on}} <b>evidential</b> inference and <b>fact</b> investigation in legal settings. He maintained that multiple methods of marshaling and analyzing evidence {{are important in}} trials and in pretrial investigation and informal fact discovery (and in many other human domains). He maintainrf that inference networks offer a useful window into investigative discovery and proof at trial. But he believed that subjective, synthetic, and gestalt-like perspectives on evidence, inference, and proof are also essential. (This aspect of his thinking about evidential inference is almost undoubtedly attributable to his early interest in Immanuel Kant, G.W.F. Hegel, and, in general, German Idealism.) ...|$|R

40|$|Understanding {{language}} is the quintessential softcomputing problem. In {{order to understand}} language, a hearer must integrate {{a wide array of}} fuzzy, incomplete, and common sense knowledge. Yet we understand language effortlessly, spontaneously, and with remarkable efficiency. This remarkable human ability poses a challenge for computational neuroscience: How can a system of slow neuron-like elements represent a large body of knowledge and perform a wide range of inferences with such speed? SHRUTI attempts to address this challenge by demonstrating how a neural network can encode a large body of (i) specific facts, (ii) rules involving variables, negation, quantification, multiple antecedents and consequents, and (iii) knowledge about entities and types, and yet perform a wide range of inferences within a few hundred milliseconds. This paper provides a brief overview of SHRUTI with an emphasis on the encoding of soft (<b>evidential)</b> rules and <b>facts,</b> {{and the manner in which}} SHRUTI combines evidence during inference. ...|$|R
60|$|The same {{may be said}} {{of many of the}} {{subordinate}} groups, or orders, into which these great classes are divided. At the present time, for example, there are numerous forms of non-ruminant pachyderms, or what we may call broadly, the pig tribe, and many varieties of ruminants. These latter have their definite characteristics, and the former have their distinguishing peculiarities. But there is nothing that fills up the gap between the ruminants and the pig tribe. The two are distinct. Such also is the case in respect of the minor groups of the class of reptiles. The existing fauna shows us crocodiles, lizards, snakes, and tortoises; but no connecting link between the crocodile and lizard, nor between the lizard and snake, nor between the snake and the crocodile, nor between any two of these groups. They are separated by absolute breaks. If, then, it could be shown that this state of things had always existed, the fact would be fatal to the doctrine of evolution. If the intermediate gradations, which the doctrine of evolution requires to have existed between these groups, are not to be found anywhere in the records of the past history of the globe, their absence is a strong and weighty negative argument against evolution; while, on the other hand, if such intermediate forms are to be found, that is so much to the good of evolution; although for reasons which I will lay before you by and by, we must be cautious in our estimate of the <b>evidential</b> cogency of <b>facts</b> of this kind.|$|R
40|$|Background: A growing {{reshoring}} {{trend has}} recently been discovered, when companies bring back their manufacturing to the domestic country. Reshoring has received more public attention recently and the interest in reshoring strategies is growing. The knowledge about the reshoring decision is however limited {{and there is not}} a great deal of research addressing this. The knowledge about how companies have performed their cost analysis is limited as well as the risk assessments behind the reshoring decision. Hence, there is a knowledge gap regarding what cost and risk factors that are critical to consider in a reshoring decision. Purpose: The purpose of this master's thesis is to identify critical cost and risk factors to consider in a reshoring decision within Swedish companies. Method: The research design includes a literature review to identify what cost and risk factors that already have been stated. A literature review was essential in order to demonstrate current knowledge in the field. The search included four databases involving several search terms. Since the purpose is to gain a deeper understanding about the phenomenon and to investigate in depth within a real-life context a multiple case study was viewed as a proper method to use. The multiple case study included four companies and was performed using semi structured interviews and investigations of cost analyses and risk assessments.    Findings: This thesis shows that {{there is a great deal}} of factors that are critical in a reshoring decision. However, Coordination, Inventory, Management, Quality and Transportation were the most common cost factors to consider when deciding for reshoring. The most frequent risk factors mentioned by the case companies were Control, Engineering and Innovation and Undesirable reaction. Implications: Different factors are critical depending on what type of company considering the reshoring decision. This is due to deviations in such as products, company strategy, customers and manufacturing techniques. Since each company and each product is unique it is overall important to identify which costs to include in the cost analysis in a reshoring decision for one specific company. The result of the thesis indicates that critical cost factors that are more difficult to measure and compare, so called soft factors, have a great effect on the reshoring decision. Further, companies seem to consider risks with remaining in the offshored country to a higher extent than the risks of reshoring. These risks that appear if not reshoring seem to be of an importance to consider since they generate costs. The findings of the thesis are believed to be <b>evidential</b> to the <b>fact</b> that there is a lack of research since critical factors found in the multiple case study are more than the existing literature indicates...|$|R
40|$|This Thesis {{focuses on}} the {{interpretation}} of the ’directed activities’ connecting factor in the context of cross-border electronic commerce in tangible goods. The connecting factor is used as a condition for applying the private interna-tional law consumer protection rules of Regulation (EC) No 44 / 2001 (the Brussels Regulation) and Regulation (EC) No 593 / 2008 (the Rome I Regulation). The two-part connecting factor gives that a consumer contract is eligible for protection only if two cumulative conditions are met. Firstly, the business must have directed its activities to consumer’s jurisdiction or several jurisdictions including that. Secondly, the contract must falls within the scope of such activities. Before addressing the main purpose, it is reviewed what kind of consumer protection these Regulations offer. In addition, the significance of these rules is observed {{in the light of the}} recent developments in fields of procedural and substantial EU consumer law. The perspective of this study is European. The connecting factor is a product of the Europeanized private international law and it is specifically designed to provide protection for consumer engaging in e-commerce. In order to facilitate consumer trust in e-commerce, the circumstances in which consumers can resort to the protective rules should be clearly defined. However, the practical application of the connecting factor has been ambiguous. The main purpose of this study is to identify those legal facts which are relevant when determining if the requirements set down in the connecting factor are satisfied. In addition, the aim is to clarify how much <b>evidential</b> value these <b>facts</b> can bear in practical situations. The analysis is illustrated with examples of situations in which a consumer can, could or cannot enjoy the protection. The methodological focus is on analyzing the relevant case law of the ECJ. The interpretation established in the case law is complemented by analyzing the preparatory works for the relevant community instruments and Advocate Generals’ Opinions. In addition, visions created in academic debate are reviewed in order to see if they are in line with the autonomous interpretation. This study is mainly concerned with consumers’ interests and claims that consumers should be able to foresee their legal position before concluding a contract. In addition, the study acknowledges that consumers’ interests must be balanced against professionals’ interests. The main finding of this study is that, despite the recent case law and academic debate, the practical application of the connecting factor relies on case-by-case evaluation. Thus it is challenging to create clear guidelines for its application. Firstly, when considering if a website accessible in consumer’s jurisdiction constitutes an activity directed to that country, the evaluation should take into account website features and the professional’s overall activity. Consumers can enjoy the protection only if it is apparent that the professional was minded to conclude contracts with customers from consumer’s jurisdiction. Secondly, when determining whether the contract falls within the scope of the directed activities, the evaluation is based on the circumstances which led to the conclusion of the contract and in which the contract is concluded. It is discovered that, if the contract is concluded through the website, it generally falls within the scope of protection. However, if the contract is concluded by other means, there must be evidence indicating that there is a link between the directed activity and the contract. The general finding is that this fact-specific case-by-case evaluation will continue to cause uncertainty for consumers and professionals engaging in cross-border e-commerce...|$|R
