50|$|Depending on the system, {{hydraulic}} fuses may reset automatically after a delay, or {{may require}} manual re-opening. Forklift main hoist cylinders are usually {{equipped with a}} fuse built into the <b>hose</b> <b>adapter</b> {{at the base of}} the cylinder that resets immediately upon stopping the flow.|$|E
40|$|An {{anesthetic}} {{gas flow}} pop-off valve canister is described that is airtight and permits {{the patient to}} breath freely. Once its release mechanism is activated, the exhaust gases are collected at a <b>hose</b> <b>adapter</b> and passed through activated coal for adsorption. A survey of laminar air flow clean rooms is presented and the installation of laminar cross flow air systems in operating rooms is recommended. Laminar flow ventilation experiments determine drying period evaporation rates for chicken intestines, sponges, and sections of pig stomach...|$|E

50|$|In the United States, {{a growing}} number of {{departments}} use Storz couplers for large diameter supply hose, or other quick-action couplings. Because the usage is not standardized, mutual aid apparatus might have a compartment on their trucks dedicated to a multitude of <b>hose</b> <b>adapters.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1967 the Dynacraft {{division}} {{was formed to}} provide belts, <b>hoses,</b> <b>adapters,</b> and other accessories for Kenworth and Peterbilt truck plants. In 1969, 28 acres of land were purchased at suburban Bayswater - 30 kms east of Melbourne for Kenworth Australia. Construction plans were drawn up and by 1970, the 56,000 sq ft factory and office complex was completed to produce trucks initially on a CKD (Completely Knocked Down) basis. During Kenworth Australia's 35 year history in Australia, {{it has become a}} major manufacturing force in the Australian, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea markets.|$|R
50|$|A trickle ring is a {{circular}} drip irrigation device which evenly distributes water {{around the base}} of a tree or shrub. Connected to a water supply by a garden <b>hose</b> or tubing <b>adapter</b> fitting, trickle rings may be integrated into an irrigation network which waters many plants at the same time. By regulating the flow of water through the trickle ring, soil can be saturated at a rate which conserves water by minimizing wasteful surface runoff and losses due to evaporation.|$|R
