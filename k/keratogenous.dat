5000|$|Trichorrhexis invaginata (also {{known as}} [...] "Bamboo hair" [...] ) is a {{distinctive}} hair shaft abnormality {{that may occur}} sporadically, either in normal hair or with other hair shaft abnormalities, or regularly as a marker for Netherton's syndrome. The primary defect appears to be abnormal keratinization of the hair shaft in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone, allowing for intussusception of the fully keratinized and hard distal shaft into the incompletely keratinized and soft proximal portion of the shaft.|$|E
50|$|The matrix, {{sometimes}} called the matrix unguis, <b>keratogenous</b> membrane, nail matrix, or onychostroma, is the tissue (or germinal matrix) which the nail protects. It {{is the part of}} the nail bed that is beneath the nail and contains nerves, lymph and blood vessels.The matrix is responsible for producing cells that become the nail plate. The width and thickness of the nail plate is determined by the size, length, and thickness of the matrix, while the shape of the fingertip itself shows if the nail plate is flat, arched, or hooked. The matrix will continue to grow as long as it receives nutrition and remains in a healthy condition.As new nail plate cells are made, they push older nail plate cells forward; and in this way older cells become compressed, flat, and translucent. This makes the capillaries in the nail bed below visible, resulting in a pink color.|$|E
40|$|A {{granular}} structure {{was found in}} the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of the cortex in human hair follicles. This granule was a round, relatively electron-dense, homogeneous structure 0. 1 – 0. 3 μm in diameter and not membrane-limited. It appeared in cortical cells in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone, fused to the tonofilaments, and disappeared before the complete keratinization of the cortex. Thus, this granule was considered to be a trichohyaline granule. Similar granules were found in the nuclei of cortical cells in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone. A comprehensive survey of various human hairs confirmed tins observation. Trichohyaline granules were also present in the cortical cells of guinea pig hair in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone. However, a similar survey on mouse hair cortex did not reveal trichohyaline granules in this species...|$|E
40|$|AbstractUsing an {{antibody}} {{directed against}} γ-secretase-generated antigen unique to activated Notch 1, we mapped Notch 1 activation strictly to suprabasal cells in epidermis, nail matrix, and other skin appendages during normal development. The consequences of Notch 1 activation in keratinizing nail cells were investigated in a transgenic mouse model. Ectopic activation of Notch 1 in postmitotic cells within the nail <b>keratogenous</b> zone resulted in longer nails. BrdU labeling revealed an {{increased number of}} mitotic cells in transgenic nails. The matrix and <b>keratogenous</b> zone expanded distally due {{to the increase in}} cell numbers. The mitosis-promoting effects by a gene product expressed exclusively in postmitotic cells indicates a long-range effect of transgenic Notch 1 on regulation of nail homeostasis. We demonstrate that activation of Notch 1 in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone resulted in ectopic activation of Wnt signaling, the first such evidence in vertebrates. However, we detected little or no β-catenin activation in proliferating matrix cells, indicating that Wnt is at most an indirect mediator of Notch-induced proliferation. These data support the existence of a novel, cell-nonautonomous role for Notch in maintaining homeostasis of stratified squamous epithelia by indirectly promoting mitosis in basally located cells...|$|E
40|$|A new fluorogenic maleimide DACM, i. e., N(7 -dimethyl amino- 4 -methyl coumarinyl) maleimide, {{does not}} fluoresce by itself. It is {{specifically}} combined with —SR groups and becomes fluorescent (λ: ex: 400 nm, λ: em: 485 nm). At this range of excitation the frozen skin section has no native fluorescence because the emission maximum of DACM does not overlap {{with any of}} aromatic residues of proteins such as tryptophane. S—S groups can be demonstrated with DACM by inhibiting native —SH and then reducing SS to —SH. —SH was generally abundant at the bulb region. —SH of hair cortex was more concentrated at <b>keratogenous</b> zone. Further up in the follicle, —SH of hair cortex was gradually decreased, although at the region of isthmus, —SH reaction of the hair cortex was still moderately strong. Outer root sheath had —SH from the upper bulb {{to the surface of}} the epidermis. On the other hand, no S—S was demon-strable at the bulb region. At the level of <b>keratogenous</b> zone, however, S—S linkages of hair cortex and inner root sheath began to appear and further up in the follicle S—S linkages were increased gradually. Outer root sheath had no S—S linkages by DACM staining up until it is keratinized along the hair canal in the upper follicle. The concentration of —SH and S—S thus seemed to be reciprocal; —SH is found in non-keratinized tissues, whereas S—S is abundant in keratinized areas, These findings are at some variance with conventional data, which suggest, for example, that —SH groups disappear suddenly above the <b>keratogenous</b> zone...|$|E
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of H 3 -tyrosine into the protein {{of the cells}} in the cortex of rat hair has been investigated by radioautography. In growing hairs, radioactivity {{is found in the}} matrix, the upper bulb, and the whole of the <b>keratogenous</b> zone up to the fully keradnized part of the shaft, 10 and 30 minutes after an injection of labelled tyrosine. This is unequivocal evidence of protein synthesis at these simms. There is a very precise relationship between the end of protein synthesis and the hardening of the cortical cells {{at the top of the}} <b>keratogenous</b> zone. The way in which the silver grains of the radioautographs are clustered indicates that at 30 minutes after the injection the isotope is distributed more evenly in the matrix and upper bulb than in the top of the <b>keratogenous</b> zone. Possibly this reflects a difference, at these sites, in the cell components engaged in protein synthesis, or in the proteins being synthesized. The fully keratinized and hardened part of the hair was not radioactive at 10 and 30 minutes after the injection of H~-tyrosine. The rate at which the radioactivity moves into this region shows that the hair of rats grows 0. 9 mm/ 24 hours. Comparison of the degree of radioactivity along the growing hair in the 30 -minute, 12 -hour, and 36 -hour materials shows conclusively that protein accumulates in the cortical cells during their keratinization. An injection of a labelled amino acid does not behave as an ideal pulse dose; consequently, the grain density over the hair cortex at 36 hours is 100 per cent larger than would be expected if an ideal pulse dose situation existed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryIn {{an attempt}} to {{investigate}} the genes expressed during the development of mouse hair follicles, we employed RNA differential display and identified a cDNA encoding μ-crystallin, that is {{a major component of}} kangaroo lens and a cytosolic NADP-regulated thyroid hormone-binding protein in human kidney. In northern blot study, μ-crystallin transcripts were detected in skin at the highest level among the mouse tissues, whereas lower but detectable in the eye, brain, kidney, heart, lung, and liver. Furthermore, in mouse skin, the gene expression of μ-crystallin followed hair cycle fundamentally, increased significantly during mid- and late anagen phases and decreased during the catagen, telogen, and early anagen phases. In situ hybridization revealed that μ-crystallin gene starts to be activated in hair cone of anagen III, and that in anagen VI, its expression is detected predominantly in the cuticle layer of the inner root sheath from the upper hair bulb to the middle portion of the <b>keratogenous</b> zone and in the Huxley's layer through the <b>keratogenous</b> zone. The expression was not detected in catagen, telogen, and early anagen hair follicles, and any other skin components. These results suggest the possible involvement of μ-crystallin in the development of mouse hair follicles during the anagen phase...|$|E
40|$|The {{activity}} of α-naphthyl acid phosphatase was measured fluorometrically in μg samples of normal human skin and its appendages and in keloids. The preponderant distribution of this enzyme {{was in the}} <b>keratogenous</b> zones of the epidermis and hair follicles and in the disintegrating central portion of sebaceous glands. Enzyme activity was higher in the papillary than in the reticular layer of the dermis. Acid phosphatase activity in both the epidermis and dermis was higher in keloids than in normal skin: keloid nodules in the reticular layer exhibited a ten fold increase...|$|E
40|$|A genomic clone for {{a member}} of the mouse type I hair keratin protein family has been {{isolated}} and analyzed in order to study the regulation of this keratin during the hair growth cycle. The coding sequence is divided into seven exons. The gene structure is typical of keratins in particular and intermediate filaments in general in that the intron-exon borders are not located at the domain borders of the protein. Comparison with a sheep wool keratin gene shows that the splice sites in the two hair keratin genes are found at identical locations relative to the amino acid sequence of the proteins. Similarly, comparison of the promoter areas of these genes shows several areas of nucleotide sequence conservation, including the area around the TATA box and an SV 40 core enhancer sequence. In addition, a high degree of sequence identity exists in the fourth intron. In situ hybridization shows that transcripts of this gene are first found in the relatively undifferentiated proximal cortex area in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of mouse vibrissae...|$|E
40|$|Adamson's fringe {{is located}} at the upper margin of the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of the hair {{follicle}} where the nucleated hair shaft cornifies completely and gets converted to hard anucleated keratin. It marks also the area of complete keratinization of the cuticle and Henle's layer of the inner root sheath {{and the beginning of the}} stem of the follicle. In Tinea capitis, dermatophytic infection of the hair shaft is restricted to this zone and the fungi do not penetrate further down the infected hair in the bulb of the follicle. The fungi in Adamson's words form “a fringe of mycelium surrounding the hair shaft and project below the lower margin of the sheath of spores around the root-stem. ” Horatio George Adamson (1865 [...] 1955), a British dermatologist first described this phenomenon, in 1895, and this article describes Adamson's fringe with a short biography of Adamson and discusses Kligman's experiments and observations on Tinea capitis which validated the observations of Adamson and the concept of Adamson's Fringe and described the pathogenesis in Tinea capitis...|$|E
40|$|Changes in calcium levels {{control the}} {{differentiation}} of skin epithelial cells and thus may also affect the epithelial {{cells of the}} hair follicle. We have isolated a murine cDNA clone, pCAL-F 559, for the calcium-binding protein calcyclin by differential screening of a cDNA library made from RNA isolated from hair follicles of 6 -d-old mice. The identity of out cDNA clone was established by comparing the DNA sequence with the sequence of the human calcyclin gene. That the authentic calcyclin mRNA encoded by pCAL- 559 is present in skin of 3 -d-old mice was confirmed by S 1 nuclease protection assays. As measured by RNA dot blots, calcyclin mRNA levels in the skin change {{in accordance with the}} hair cycle and reaches a peak a few days prior to the mRNA for structural hair proteins. Although we can demonstrate by in situ hybridization that mRNA for calcyclin is localized in the post-mitotic <b>keratogenous</b> region of the hair follicle we can only assume that this calcium binding protein is involved in the control of differentiation of these cells by regulating their Ca++ levels...|$|E
40|$|We have {{isolated}} a hair-follicle-specific gene, termed had- 1, from a cDNA {{library of}} ICR mouse skin. Had-i is expressed specifically in skin, and its mRNA level is {{correlated with the}} active state of hair follicles in developmental and regenerative processes of hair. Its mRNA is ∼ 1 kilobase pairs (kb). Its cDNA was completely co-linear with the genomic clone, indicating that the had- 1 gene is composed of one exon. The hacl- 1 gene has an open reading frame of 579 base pairs (bp). The deduced amino acid sequence showed six direct repeats of a decapeptide on the C-terminal side. The repetitive unit contains a CQP motif, which is present in repetitive peptide sequences of some hair- and epidermal- cell – specific proteins. In situ hybridization with a 3 ' untranslated region of the hacl- 1 cDNA as a probe showed that hacl- 1 was expressed specifically in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of the cortical cells of the hair shaft. No other components of hair follicles or epidermis showed a positive signal. Thus, had-i is a novel, hair-follicle – specific gene...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the morphology of fungi invading into the human hair tissue, three cases of black dot ringworm caused by Trichophyton violaceum and Trichophyton glabrum were studied by light and electron microscopy. Fungal elements were mainly present in the hair cortex and showed a constant morphologic change during the differentiation of hair layers. The fungal elements, located deep in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of the cortex, showed less electron dense nonseptate hyphae. Distally, the hyphae showed septation and contained several scattered dense bodies in the cytoplasm. At the level where the Huxley's layer was keratinized, the fungal elements were transformed into arthrospores, which occupied the large volume of the cortex; each spore {{was surrounded by a}} fiber- and melanosome-free, electron lucent halo. Fungal elements occasionally invaded the keratinized hair cuticle and keratinized inner root sheath in a few hair follicles. Fungi do not invade the hair germinative cells. There seems to be a distinct relationship between the morphology of the invading fungi and the cortical cell differentiation in black dot ringworm; a balance between the fungus proliferation and the cortical cell development may be present...|$|E
40|$|Minoxidil, {{a potent}} vasodilator, stimulates {{the growth of}} {{terminal}} hair from vellus or miniaturized follicles in balding scalp. To study minoxidil's action on isolated follicles we developed and validated an organ culture system using mouse whisker follicles. Control follicles cultured without minoxidil showed macroscopic changes including kinking of the hair shafts and bending of the follicles. Necrosis {{was evident in the}} differentiating epithelial elements forming the cuticle, cortex, and inner root sheath. These abnormalities were eliminated or greatly reduced in minoxidil-treated follicles. The morphology of these follicles was consistent with the production of new hair during culture. Direct measurement demonstrated that minoxidil-treated follicles grew significantly longer than control follicles during the 3 -d culture. Minoxidil increased the incorporation of radiolabeled cysteine and glycine in follicles compared with control treatment. Doses of minoxidil up to 1 mM caused increased cysteine incorporation, while higher doses were inhibitory. Experiments with labeled thymidine indicated that minoxidil induced proliferation of hair epithelial cells near the base of the follicle. Autoradiography also showed that cysteine accumulated in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone above the dermal papilla. These studies demonstrate that organ cultured follicles are suitable for determining minoxidil's mechanism of action and may be useful for studying other aspects of hair biology. The results also show that minoxidil's effect on hair follicles is direct. This suggests that minoxidil's action in vivo includes more than just increasing blood flow to hair follicles...|$|E
40|$|By a {{hybridoma}} technique using BALB/c {{mice and}} Sp 2 / 0 -Ag 14 mouse myeloma cells, monoclonal antibodies against hair fibrous proteins (HFP) were produced. Two monoclonal antibodies, designated as HKN- 5 and HKN- 7, were chosen. Either HFP or epidermal fibrous proteins (EFP) were electrophoretically separated on polyacrylamide gels with sodium dodecyl sulfate. By immunoblot analyses, HKN- 5 and HKN- 7 decorated the electrophoretic bands of HFP but not those ot EFP. Immunohistochemically, these monoclonal antibodies stained the medulla, cortex, cuticle, and inner root sheath in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of anagen hairs, but not hair matrix cells. HKN- 5 further reacted with the innermost cells (IMG) {{of the outer}} root sheath; these cells formed a single cell layer located outside of the Henle's layer. HKN- 7 did not react with the outer root sheath including the IMG. Neither monoclonal antibody reacted with any other skin components or any tissues of other organs examined. Ultrastructurally, the IMG of the outer root sheath showed a unique cell differentiation forming an independent cell layer. It is suggested that the cells in the medulla, cortex, cuticle, and inner root sheath of anagen hair and hair follicles possess a similar keratin expression and that the IMC of the outer root sheath display a unique keratin expression and their own cell differentiation, resulting in 2 types of keratinization of the outer root sheath; keratinization of IMG and trichilemmal keratinization...|$|E
40|$|We have {{previously}} identified a cysteine-rich calcium binding protein S 100 A 3 {{present in the}} cuticle of human hair fiber. In this study, we cloned a cDNA for mouse S 100 A 3, identified its gene location, and elucidated the expression profile throughout hair follicle development. The mouse S 100 A 3 gene was clustered with other S 100 family members on chromosome 3, and specifically expressed in dorsal skin containing hair follicles. The level of S 100 A 3 mRNA was elevated during the anagen phase of the hair growth cycle, and sharply declined from the regression phase on. In situ hybridization revealed that the S 100 A 3 gene was prominently expressed in cuticular cells of the hair follicle, and mRNA levels were highest in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone over the entire cuticular layer. Expression was also observed {{to a lesser extent}} in differentiated cortical cells; however, expression was not observed in any other component of the hair follicle or dorsal tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that the S 100 A 3 protein accumulated in cuticular and cortical cells undergoing terminal differentiation. These results indicate that the S 100 A 3 gene is exclusively expressed, and the translation product retained, in follicular cells differentiating into major components of the hair shaft. It seems likely that S 100 A 3 {{plays an important role in}} calcium-dependent processes leading to hair shaft formation...|$|E
40|$|To {{identify}} the anagen hair follicle-specific proteins, we screened the cDNA library prepared from the murine skins of anagen phase by the differential hybridization technique. Fifty-four cDNA clones expressed specifically in anagen phase were isolated, and most {{were found to}} correspond to known proteins in the hair follicles. Alternatively, we isolated a cDNA clone encoding a novel protein that possessed an entire open reading frame of 501 base pairs. This protein with a molecular weight of 17. 9 kDa has no specific motifs nor significant homology to proteins already reported, although it contains some direct repeats that are often observed in intermediate filament-associated proteins and has a similar amino acid composition {{as a member of}} them. Northern blot analysis demonstrates that the transcript of this protein is skin specific, and that it is present in mid- and late anagen but not in catagen, telogen, and early anagen phases. The transcript appears to be expressed specifically in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of the cortical cells of hair follicles, as exhibited by in situ hybridization. Furthermore, immunohistochemical study confirms that the protein is distributed in the cytoplasms of the keratinizing cortical cells and is undetected in the completely keratinized ones. These results suggest that this protein can be identified as a new member of intermediate filament-associated proteins and is related to the keratinization of the cortical cell layer in mouse hair. Therefore, we have termed this novel protein mKAP 13 according to the unified nomenclature...|$|E
40|$|The plucked hairs and biopsied hair follicles of {{the scalp}} were {{obtained}} from a female patient with monilethrix. By scanning electron microscopy, the plucked hairs showed a typical moniliform feature composed of alternated nodes and inter- nodes. By computer stereography, reconstructed three-dimensional models of in vivo hair structures showed that the diameter of hair shaft was partially reduced in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone and that the reduction was severe in the hair cortex and cuticle layers but mild in the inner root sheath. By transmission electron microscopy, a significant degeneration of hair matrix cells was found, and a zig-zag disarray of cortical tonofibrils and invaginations of the hair cuticle cells into the cortex were noticed in the suprabulbar portion. In some hairs, the hair bulbs showed no degeneration, but a degeneration of cortical cells and invaginations of hair cuticle were seen in some portions in the developing zone of the cortex. This suggests that not every hair matrix is damaged in a synchronized fashion, but individual hairs are affected independently. Furthermore, in all the hair and hair follicles examined, cytoplasmic vacuolations were always seen in the various layers, and abnormal formation of tonofibrils was often observed in the cortex. In monilethrix, a cell abnormality may inherently {{be present in the}} hair tissue and, when such abnormality occurs severely, the cortical cells are particularly affected in the hair matrix. This seems to result in. a decrease in number of cortical cells and thinning of the hair shaft...|$|E
40|$|Retinoic acid-inducible gene- 1 was {{originally}} {{identified as an}} orphan G-protein coupled receptor induced by retinoic acid. Three highly homologous oGPCR (GPRC 5 B, GPRC 5 C, and GPRC 5 D) have since been classified into the RAIG 1 family. We describe here, the unique tissue distribution of GPRC 5 D and its mechanism of expression. Hybridization in situ has shown that GPRC 5 D is expressed in differentiating cells that produce hard keratin, including cortical cells of the hair shaft, the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of the nail, and in a central region of the filiform papillae of the tongue. The GPRC 5 D transcript is expressed in hair follicles during mid- and late anagen, and catagen but not at telogen and early anagen phases. The differentiation-inducer, all-trans retinoic acid, induces GPRC 5 D expression in cultured hair bulb cells. Because the tissue distribution of GPRC 5 D indicates a relationship with hard keratins that constitute the major structural proteins of hard epithelial tissues, we investigated the effect of GPRC 5 D on acid hard keratins. Analyses of cultured cells showed that transient overexpression resulted in suppression of Ha 3 and stimulation of Ha 4 hair keratin gene expression. The expression was maintained in the hair follicles of whn-deficient (nude) mice, suggesting that this gene is regulated by a signal pathway {{different from that of}} hair keratin synthesis. Collectively, these data provide a framework for understanding the molecular mechanisms of GPRC 5 D function in hard keratinization...|$|E
40|$|Hair {{follicle}} differentiation {{involves the}} expression of both epithelial-type keratins or cytokeratins and hair keratins as well as hair keratin-associated proteins. In this study, a cDNA clone encoding a cytokeratin family member was isolated using RNA differential display techniques. The predicted amino acid sequence derived from this clone, revealed a homology {{with a number of}} cytokeratins, not only in the central α-helical regions but also in the conserved portions of the amino and carboxy terminal domains, indicating that this protein represents a new member of the mouse type II cytokeratin family. Northern blot analysis showed expression in mouse skin, but not in other tissues, including tongue, esophagus, and forestomach. One- and two-dimensional western blot analysis showed that this new cytokeratin was 57 [*]kDa in size and ran slightly below the area of cytokeratin 5, which corresponded to that of the cytokeratin 6 family members. Both RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies of mouse anagen hair follicles demonstrated expression of this cytokeratin in the inner root sheath hair cone during anagen III and in the Henle and Huxley layers of the inner root sheath during anagen VI. The expression of the new cytokeratin began in the hair bulb and progressed up to the height of the <b>keratogenous</b> zone. Taken together the sum of the data analyzed, we have termed this novel cytokeratin mK 6 irs (mouse gene nomenclature k 2 - 6 g) to indicate both its similar mobility with K 6 in two-dimensional gels and its specific expression in the inner root sheath of the hair follicle...|$|E
40|$|The {{sites of}} the {{incorporation}} of labeled cystine into keratinizing structures were studied in electron microscopic autoradiographs. The tracer used was cystine labeled with S 3 ~ emitting long-range ionizing particles. During exposure for 1 to 2 months, according to our method of electron microscopic autoradiography, emulsion-coated specimens were exposed to a static magnetic field which appeared {{to result in a}} marked {{increase in the number of}} reacted silver grains. In young Swiss mice receiving intraperitoneal injections at 1, 3, and 6 hours before biopsy, conventional autoradiography demonstrated that S 35 cystine was intensely localized in the <b>keratogenous</b> zone of anagen hair follicles, and that the radioactivity there increased in intensity progressively with time while the radioactivity in the hair bulb always remained very low. Our observations with electron microscopic autoradiography in a magnetic field appeared to indicate that at 3 and 6 hours after injection the S 35 -cystine was directly and specifically incorporated into tonofibrils in the hair cortex and into amorphous keratin granules of the hair cuticle layer, possibly without any particular concentration of this substance in the other cellular components. There seemed to be an appreciable concentration of cystine in tonofibrils of the cuticle of the inner root sheath. However, trichohyalin granules in the hair medulla and inner root sheath failed to show any evidence of cystine concentration. The improved sensitivity of the electron microscopic autoradiography with S 35 -cystine appeared to be partly due to the application of a static magnetic field. However, the reason for this could not be explained theoretically...|$|E
40|$|Peptidylarginine deiminase catalyzes the post-translational {{modification}} of proteins through {{the conversion of}} arginine to citrulline {{in the presence of}} calcium ions. In rodents, peptidylarginine deiminase has been classified into four isoforms, types I, II, III, and IV, which are distinct in their molecular weights, substrate specificities, and tissue localization. Of these isoforms, only type III was detected in epidermis and hair follicles. Although the role of this enzyme in these tissues is not yet clear, indirect data have shown that several structural proteins such as filaggrin, trichohyalin, and keratin are substrates for peptidylarginine deiminase. In this study, we cloned the full-length cDNA of human peptidylarginine deiminase type III (3142 [*]bp) from cultured human keratinocytes by reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction and by rapid amplification of cDNA ends methods. This cDNA contained a 1995 [*]bp open reading frame encoding 664 amino acids (Mr[*]=[*] 74 [*] 770). To explore the physicochemical and enzymatic properties of human peptidylarginine deiminase type III, we constructed a plasmid for producing a recombinant human peptidylarginine deiminase type III in bacteria. The enzymatic characteristics of the recombinant enzyme were very {{similar to those of the}} rodent peptidylarginine deiminase type III. The recombinant enzyme showed the catalytic activities toward structural proteins of epidermis and hair follicle, filaggrin and trichohyalin, in which the deiminations maxima of about 60 % and 13 % arginine residues were observed in filaggrin and trichohyalin, respectively. An immunohistochemical study of human scalp skin with a monospecific anti-peptidyl-arginine deiminase type III antibody revealed that the type III enzyme was localized to the inner root sheath and outer root sheath of hair follicles. Peptidylarginine deiminase type III in the inner root sheath was notable between supramatrix and <b>keratogenous</b> zone and was scarcely detected in cornified hair zone. The enzyme was also expressed in the cuticle layer of hair. On the other hand, expression of the enzyme in the epidermis was very low. These data imply that human peptidylarginine deiminase type III is the predominant isoform in hair follicles and may function as a modulator of hair structural proteins, including trichohyalin during hair and hair follicle formation...|$|E
