Measures were implemented to ensure the industrialization of coca production, with Morales inaugurating the first coca industrialization plant in Chulumani, which produced and packaged coca and trimate tea; the project was primarily <b>funded</b> <b>through</b> a $125,000 donation from Venezuela under the PTA scheme.|$|E

5|$|According to Congressman Jim Himes' website, the {{demolition}} funding was appropriated in 2009 {{and consisted of}} more than $2 million through federal funding. The money was <b>funded</b> <b>through</b> the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, the Comprehensive Appropriations Act of 2009, and a Community Development Block Grant. According to the Connecticut Post, the State of Connecticut funded $1.2 million for {{the demolition}} of the bridge, and {{the first phase of}} the project was expected to cost $500,000. The contract for the demolition of the bridge was given to S Corporation and the first task was to remove the eastern portion of the bridge. The entire process was expected to take six weeks to demolish the bridge. It was estimated that another $450,000 would be needed to remove the bridge's concrete counter-weights and $8 million to remove the approaches. In 2010, the Drawbridge Operation Regulation; Pequonnock River, Bridgeport, CT struck the rule pertaining to the operation of the bridge due to its removal.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} college in Detroit, Mansour entered {{religious}} orders then earned {{a doctorate in}} biochemistry. She served {{as the president of}} Mercy College of Detroit from 1971 to 1983. She ran unsuccessfully for public office in 1982, in the process provoking comment from the Archbishop of Detroit. The Governor of Michigan appointed her to lead the state's social services department, and she was confirmed in early 1983. During this time, the Archbishop of Detroit and Vatican officials asked Mansour declare herself against abortion—her department was responsible for abortion services <b>funded</b> <b>through</b> Medicaid. Mansour refused to make such a statement, and two months after her confirmation as director she was required by the Vatican to decide whether she was to continue as director or as a nun. She chose to give up her vows as a nun. After serving out her appointment she was inducted into the Michigan Women's Hall of Fame in 1988.|$|E
5|$|Berry was {{appointed}} Assistant Secretary for Policy, Management and Budget at the U.S. Department of the Interior during the Clinton administration, serving from 1997 to 2001.

These changes were partly <b>funded</b> <b>through</b> partnerships with federal employees, unions and other agencies to reduce costs for the department. Berry worked to create a complaint procedure for employees who experience discrimination because of their sexual orientation, to expand relocation benefits and counseling services to domestic partners of employees, to establish a liaison to gay and lesbian workers, and to eliminate discriminatory provisions of the National Park Service's law enforcement standards. He helped establish an office supply store for Interior employees, which he staffed with disabled workers. Berry oversaw {{one of the largest}} budgetary increases in the department's history.|$|E

5|$|Howe cabled Anderson {{expressing the}} Canadian government's {{agreement}} in principle, but requesting {{a more detailed}} appraisal {{of the cost of}} the proposed laboratory. Sir John Anderson replied that he envisaged a laboratory with about 30 scientists and 25 laboratory assistants, of whom 22 scientists and 6 laboratory assistants would be sent from Britain. The estimated running cost was £60,000 per annum. He agreed that the costs and salaries would be divided between the British and Canadian governments, but the British share would come from a billion-dollar war gift from Canada. The Canadians found this acceptable. Howe and Mackenzie then travelled to London to finalise arrangements for the laboratory's governance. It was agreed that it would be run by a Policy Committee consisting of Howe and MacDonald and be administered by and <b>funded</b> <b>through</b> the NRC, with research directed by a Technical Committee chaired by Halban.|$|E
5|$|In late 2013, graphic {{designer}} Darren Wall released an art {{book about the}} history of British developer Sensible Software. <b>Funded</b> <b>through</b> the crowdfunding website Kickstarter and written by games journalist Gary Penn of Zzap!64, Sensible Software 1986–1999 is a 340-page anthology of the company's full catalogue, from its popular 16-bit games (e.g. Sensible Soccer, Cannon Fodder, Wizball) to its lesser-known products and features. It also explains the personalities behind the company, mainly its founders Jon Hare and Chris Yates, through long-form interviews. Hare was elated when Wall originally contacted him about the project, but Yates, who has been estranged from Hare since 2003, did not participate. Hare explained the company's issues with scaling and hiring, and how the company was slow to transition to 3D graphics. Other commentators featured in the book include developer and entrepreneur David Darling, television personality Dominik Diamond, musician Martin Galway, and games journalist Gary Whitta.|$|E
5|$|In the Lillehammer {{bid for the}} 1994 Winter Olympics, the {{agreement}} between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues. However, after the games were awarded the responsibility {{was taken over by}} Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) and the town's five venues were ultimately <b>funded</b> <b>through</b> state grants. To allow for post-Olympic use, a fund was created by the state, of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone (NOK). Unlike the Hamar venues, which survive on their fund's yield, the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital. From 2014 the post-Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into. A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state, while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality.|$|E
