5|$|At 6 feet (1.83 metres) and 212 pounds (96 kilograms), Booth's size {{enables him to}} play in {{the style}} of a power forward. Along with his {{physical}} stature, he is a fast skater, both of which allow him to retain the puck and contribute to <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> skills.|$|E
5|$|Lajoie {{finished}} the season tied for third-most in hits (168) while Cobb's batting average, slugging and on-base percentages, and hit total led the American League. Baseball historians have suggested the managerial duties Lajoie took on affected <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> numbers.|$|E

5|$|Allen briefly {{flirted with}} the 2010 NBA draft. He {{declared}} for early {{entry in the}} draft, but did not hire an agent. After one workout with the Portland Trail Blazers, Allen was told {{to return to school}} to work on <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> game. On May8, Allen officially pulled his name out of consideration for the draft. He did so on the final day allowed by the NCAA to ensure collegiate eligibility.|$|E
5|$|By 1279 however, Charles had {{established}} his control not only over the Latin states of Greece (after 1278 {{he was the}} Prince of Achaea), but also received the submission and vassalage of Nikephoros I, Despot of Epirus. In August 1279, in preparation for resuming <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> against Michael along the Via Egnatia, Charles appointed as his vicar-general in Albania the Burgundian Hugo de Sully. Over the next year, Sully received {{a steady flow of}} supplies, siege equipment and reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> {{success in}} junior, Giordano went unselected at the NHL Entry Draft. He {{accepted}} {{an invitation to}} attend the Phoenix Coyotes' training camp where, according to then-Owen Sound General Manager Mike Futa, Giordano impressed team officials but believed {{that he would be}} best served by playing a second season in the OHL. Giordano finished the 2003–04 season with 49 points.|$|E

25|$|Malvar, {{along with}} other generals like Mariano Trías, Paciano Rizal, Manuel Tinio and Artemio Ricarte, was opposed to the pact, believing it was a ruse of the Spanish {{to get rid of}} the Revolution easily, and {{therefore}} resumed military offensives. Aguinaldo, seeing the stiff resistance of Malvar and his sympathizers, issued a circular ordering the revolutionary generals to stop fighting. On January 6, 1898, Malvar ceased <b>his</b> <b>offensives.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> best <b>offensive</b> year in {{the major}} leagues was in 1954, when he had 73 hits and 14 home runs.|$|R
5|$|Huggins {{began his}} playing career in minor league {{baseball}} with the Mansfield Haymakers of the Class B Interstate League in 1899. He continued his minor league apprenticeship with the St. Paul Saints of the American Association from 1901 through 1903. After starting his career as an exclusively right-handed hitter, he began to bat {{from the left side}} in 1902 in response to <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> struggles in the 1901 season while also moving to second base during his time at St. Paul.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} season of his {{contract}} with the Avalanche in 2015–16, Tanguay struggled to retain <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> role in the top six, registering just 4 goals in 52 games. On February 29, 2016 Tanguay {{was traded to the}} Arizona Coyotes along with Conner Bleackley and Kyle Wood in exchange for Mikkel Boedker. He made a successful transition and played out the season in contributing with 13 points in 18 games.|$|E
5|$|After the 2011 season, Edsall fired both <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> {{coordinator}} Gary Crowton and his {{defensive coordinator}} Todd Bradford. Mike Locksley, {{who had been}} fired in 2011 from his head coaching position at New Mexico, was hired {{to be the new}} offensive coordinator. Locksley had previously worked at Maryland under head coaches Vanderlinden and Friedgen, and was the recruiting coordinator for Maryland before and during the three consecutive 10+ win seasons under Friedgen. Brian Stewart, who had been the defensive coordinator for the Houston Cougars, was hired to replace Bradford as the new defensive coordinator.|$|E

5|$|In Ronaldo's absence, however, Nani's {{style has}} {{developed}} into {{that of a}} more traditional winger; while being able to play on both wings, he is more comfortable on the right, {{where he has been}} known to utilise his pace, ball control, technical skills and trickery to create space and provide crosses for teammates. While capable of cutting off both wings to strike at goal from distance, Nani has substantially fewer goals, yet a substantially higher proportion of assists than his former colleague. Due to <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> movement, he can also play in a more offensive role, as a forward, inverted winger, second striker, or even in a more central position, as a main striker.|$|E
5|$|Kesler {{is known}} as a two-way forward, capable of {{contributing}} both offensively and defensively. In his first few years in the NHL, he established his role as a shutdown forward, playing on the penalty kill and against opposing teams' top players. He also earned a reputation as an agitator, trash-talking and engaging opponents physically in between play. During the 2008–09 season, Kesler began adding a more offensive component to his game and was moved up to the Canucks' second line from third. With an increased points total, he earned league recognition with his first Selke Trophy nomination as the NHL's best defensive forward. He has since continued to improve <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> skills while remaining defensively responsible.|$|E
5|$|Not {{known for}} <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> ability, Regehr ended a 100-game goal scoring drought {{early in the}} season, {{finishing}} with four for the season. He set a career high with 18 points, and was {{a key player in}} the Flames improbable run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals facing top opposition players. He played the final two games of the Stanley Cup Final despite tearing ligaments in his foot in game five. His performance in the post season earned him the praise of his opponents.|$|E
50|$|Mike Bloomgren left <b>his</b> {{assistant}} <b>offensive</b> coordinator {{position with}} the team in February to become the offensive line coach and run coordinator at Stanford.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, the Tower Hamlets Partnership {{began to}} survey {{residents}} of Brick Lane {{to ask whether}} they considered <b>his</b> graffiti <b>offensive</b> and should be removed.|$|R
5|$|On 14 February, Wellington {{launched}} <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> {{toward the}} east. On the right flank was Rowland Hill's 20,000-man corps {{which included the}} 2nd and 3rd Divisions, Lecor's Portuguese and Morillo's Spanish divisions and Fane's cavalry. Hill's main column struck toward Harispe's division at Hélette. Picton moved on the left flank against Villatte's division at Bonloc and Morillo took his men through the foothills on the right flank. On 15 February, Hill's column defeated Harispe's division in the Battle of Garris and forced the French to abandon Saint-Palais and {{the line of the}} Bidouze River.|$|E
5|$|Returning to Michigan {{following}} his draft, <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> production declined to 27 points over 39 games. The Wolverines {{returned to the}} CCHA finals, but were defeated by the Ohio State Buckeyes. Returning to form in 2004–05, Tambellini notched 24 goals and 57 points over 42 games, earning CCHA First All-Star Team honours. He led the Wolverines to a second Mason Cup championship in three years and {{was chosen as the}} CCHA Tournament MVP. Competing in the NCAA tournament, Tambellini was named to the NCAA Midwest Regional All-Tournament and NCAA West Second All-Star Teams.|$|E
5|$|Salo {{is known}} as a two-way defenceman, capable of being matched up against {{opposing}} team's top players, while also contributing offensively. <b>His</b> <b>offensive</b> game is characterized by his powerful slapshot. He has won numerous hardest shot titles with the Canucks in the team's SuperSkills competitions, clocking one shot at 102.7 miles-per-hour (163.5 kph) in 2012. As a result, he is used frequently on the powerplay, being set up by teammates for shots from the point. A well-rounded defenceman, Salo also earns time on the penalty kill.|$|E
50|$|While, in some respects, Marmaduke tactically won the Battle of Chalk Bluff, the Union forces {{claimed a}} {{strategic}} victory {{since he had}} abandoned <b>his</b> spring <b>offensive.</b>|$|R

5|$|The American {{command in}} Saigon and the {{politicians}} in Washington were opposed to a wet season Hmong offensive, supporting instead a holding action {{on the edge of}} the Plain of Jars as a prelude to a possible cease-fire. Washington also insisted that U.S. airpower be used to interdict PAVN supply lines, not as close air support for ground operations. Vang Pao took up the offensive anyway, but his forces could only occupy half of the Plain before <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> sputtered out at the end of July.|$|E
5|$|The North Carolina Tar Heels were {{coached by}} Frank McGuire, {{who was in}} his fifth season as {{head coach of the}} Tar Heels. <b>His</b> <b>offensive</b> {{philosophy}} was centered around passing before shooting. McGuire's starting line up and most of the roster consisted of players primarily from around the New York area. Tommy Kearns and Pete Brennan were two offensive specialists. Center Joe Quigg provided a solid presence in the paint and grabbed almost nine rebounds per game. Guard Bob Cunningham was one of the teams best defensive players. The team was led by Lennie Rosenbluth who averaged almost twentyeight points a game and served as the team's clutch performer.|$|E
5|$|There were fears Iginla {{would again}} hold out after his {{contract}} expired following the season. They were unfounded, however, as {{he signed a}} two-year, $13 million deal before the season and was looked on to again lead the Flames offensively. Iginla fell back to 67points in 2002–03 as injuries, including a lingering finger dislocation following a fight, diminished his play. His 35 goals were still enough to lead the Flames {{for the fourth time}} in five seasons. Despite <b>his</b> <b>offensive</b> contributions, the Flames missed the playoffs.|$|E
5000|$|Lloyd George {{had told}} Edmund Allenby, who was {{appointed}} the new commander in Egypt in June, that his objective was [...] "Jerusalem before Christmas" [...] {{and that he had}} only to ask for reinforcements, although the exact nature of <b>his</b> <b>offensives</b> was still undecided when he was appointed. Amidst months of argument throughout the autumn of 1917 Robertson was able to block Lloyd George's plan to make Palestine the main theatre of operations by having Allenby make the impossible demand that thirteen extra divisions be sent to him. Allenby captured Jerusalem in December 1917.|$|R
50|$|Starting quarterback put {{together}} a nice game with <b>his</b> best <b>offensive</b> production of the year. Still, Georgia had to stave off a late rally by Mississippi State to get the win.|$|R
50|$|He played 780 career NHL games, scoring 170 {{goals and}} 340 assists for 510 points. <b>His</b> best <b>offensive</b> season, points-wise, was the 1992-93 season when he scored 47 assists and 60 points.|$|R
