25|$|The four Main Bus Switching Units (MBSUs, {{located in}} the S0 truss), control the routing of power from the four solar array wings {{to the rest of}} the ISS. In late 2011 MBSU-1, while still routing power correctly, ceased {{responding}} to commands or sending data confirming its health, and was scheduled to be swapped out at the next available EVA. In each MBSU, two power channels feed 160V DC from the arrays to two <b>DC-to-DC</b> power converters (DDCUs) that supply the 124V power used in the station. A spare MBSU was already on board, but 30 August 2012 EVA failed to be completed when a bolt being tightened to finish installation of the spare unit jammed before electrical connection was secured. The loss of MBSU-1 limits the station to 75% of its normal power capacity, requiring minor limitations in normal operations until the problem can be addressed.|$|E
500|$|The {{simplest}} of these circuits are {{a form of}} rectifier which take an AC voltage as input and outputs a doubled DC voltage. [...] The switching elements are simple diodes and they are driven to switch state merely by the alternating voltage of the input. [...] <b>DC-to-DC</b> voltage doublers cannot switch in this way and require a driving circuit to control the switching. [...] They frequently also require a switching element that can be controlled directly, such as a transistor, {{rather than relying on}} the voltage across the switch as in the simple AC-to-DC case.|$|E
2500|$|Converting DC {{power from}} one voltage to another {{is much more}} complicated. [...] One method of <b>DC-to-DC</b> {{conversion}} first converts power to AC (using a device called an inverter), then uses a transformer to change the voltage, and finally rectifies power back to DC. A frequency of typically several tens of kilohertz is used, as this requires much smaller inductance than at lower frequencies and obviates the use of heavy, bulky, and expensive iron-cored units. Another method of converting DC voltages uses a charge pump, using rapid switching to change the connections of capacitors; this technique is generally limited to supplies up {{to a couple of}} watts, owing to the size of capacitors required.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} Insight had {{a conventional}} manual transmission. Starting with the 2001 model, a CVT {{variant of the}} Insight was available; the CVT {{is similar to that}} used in the Honda Civic Hybrid and the Honda Logo. A traditional transmission shifts between a fixed set of engine-to-wheel ratios; however, a CVT allows for an infinite set of ratios between its lowest gear and its highest. A feature shared by the two hybrids (and now appearing in others) is the ability to automatically turn off the engine when the vehicle is at a stop (and restart it upon movement). Since it is more powerful than most starters of conventional cars, the Insight's electric motor can start the engine nearly instantaneously. The Integrated Motor Assist is run by an [...] "Intelligent Power Unit (IPU)", a desktop computer-sized box. The Intelligent Power Unit, the Power control Unit, the Electronic Control Unit, the vehicle's batteries, <b>dc-to-dc</b> converter and a high-voltage inverter are all located under the cargo floor of the vehicle, behind the seats.|$|E
2500|$|Clones are {{computers}} that imitate C64 functions. In {{the middle of}} 2004, after an absence from the marketplace of more than 10 years, PC manufacturer Tulip Computers BV (owners of the Commodore brand since 1997) announced the C64 Direct-to-TV (C64DTV), a joystick-based TV game based on the C64 with 30 video games built into ROM. Designed by Jeri Ellsworth, a self-taught computer designer who had earlier designed the modern C-One C64 implementation, the C64DTV was similar in concept to other mini-consoles based on the Atari 2600 and Intellivision which had gained modest success earlier in the decade. The product was advertised on QVC in the United States for the 2004 holiday season. By [...] "hacking" [...] the circuit board, {{it is possible to}} attach C1541 floppy disk drives, hard drives, second joysticks, and PS/2-keyboards to these units, which gives the DTV devices nearly all the capabilities of a full Commodore 64. The DTV hardware is also used in the mini-console Hummer, sold at RadioShack in mid-2005. In 2015, a Commodore 64 compatible motherboard was produced by Individual Computers. [...] Dubbed the [...] "C64 Reloaded", it is a modern redesign of the Commodore 64 motherboard revision 250466 with a few new features. The motherboard itself is designed to be placed in an empty C64 or C64C case already owned by the user. Produced in limited quantities, models of this Commodore 64 [...] "clone" [...] sports either machined or ZIF sockets in which the custom C64 chips would be placed. [...] The board also contains jumpers to accept different revisions of the VIC-II and SID chips, as well as the ability to jumper between the analogue video system modes PAL and NTSC. [...] The motherboard contains several innovations, including selection via the RESTORE key of multiple KERNAL and character ROMs, built-in reset toggle on the power switch, and an S-video socket to replace the original TV modulator. [...] The motherboard is powered by <b>DC-to-DC</b> converter that uses a single power input of [...] from a mains adapter to power the unit rather than the original and failure prone Commodore 64 power supply brick.|$|E

50|$|The {{buck-boost}} converter {{is a type}} of <b>DC-to-DC</b> converter {{that has}} an output voltage magnitude that is either greater than or less than the input voltage magnitude. It is equivalent to a flyback converter using a single inductor instead of a transformer.|$|E
50|$|In these <b>DC-to-DC</b> converters, {{energy is}} {{periodically}} stored within and {{released from a}} magnetic field in an inductor or a transformer, typically within a frequency range of 300 kHz to 10 MHz. By adjusting the duty cycle of the charging voltage (that is, {{the ratio of the}} on/off times), the amount of power transferred to a load can be more easily controlled, though this control can also be applied to the input current, the output current, or to maintain constant power. Transformer-based converters may provide isolation between input and output. In general, the term <b>DC-to-DC</b> converter refers to one of these switching converters.

Also, unlike Greinacher/Cockcroft-Walton which is used on high-voltage applications, the Dickson multiplier is intended for low-voltage purposes. In addition to the DC input, the circuit requires a feed of two clock pulse trains with an amplitude swinging between the DC supply rails. These pulse trains are in antiphase.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{switched-mode}} {{power supply}} that gets its power from an AC power line (called an [...] "off-line" [...] converter) requires a transformer for galvanic isolation. Some <b>DC-to-DC</b> converters may also include a transformer, although isolation may not be critical in these cases. SMPS transformers run at high frequency. Most of the cost savings (and space savings) in off-line power supplies result from the smaller size of the high frequency transformer compared to the 50/60 Hz transformers formerly used. There are additional design tradeoffs.|$|E
50|$|A boost {{converter}} (step-up converter) is a <b>DC-to-DC</b> power converter that steps up voltage (while stepping down current) from its input (supply) to its output (load). It is {{a class of}} switched-mode power supply (SMPS) containing at least two semiconductors (a diode and a transistor) {{and at least one}} energy storage element: a capacitor, inductor, or the two in combination. To reduce voltage ripple, filters made of capacitors (sometimes in combination with inductors) are normally added to such a converter's output (load-side filter) and input (supply-side filter).|$|E

Gigabit passive injectors use a transformer {{on the data}} pins to allow power and data to share the cable and is typically compatible with 802.3af Mode A. In the common [...] "passive" [...] PoE system, the injector does not communicate with the powered device to negotiate its voltage or wattage requirements, but merely supplies power at all times.
