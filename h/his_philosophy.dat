5|$|Adi Da {{initially}} {{became known}} in the spiritual counterculture of the 1970s for his books and public talks, and for the activities of his religious community. <b>His</b> <b>philosophy</b> was essentially similar to many eastern religions which see spiritual enlightenment as the ultimate priority of human life. Distinguishing his from other religious traditions, Adi Da declared {{that he was a}} uniquely historic avatar (incarnation of a god or divinity in human form). As such, Adi Da stated that henceforth devotional worship of him would be the sole means of spiritual enlightenment for anyone else.|$|E
5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, {{he was the first to}} apply it in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains <b>his</b> <b>philosophy</b> and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E
5|$|Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar {{also found}} in Buddhism a basis for <b>his</b> <b>philosophy</b> {{though he did not}} accept that religion. It was again an {{alternative}} in the search for self-respect and the object was to get liberation from the discrimination of Hinduism. Through Periyar's movement Temple Entry Acts of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the Temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for priesthood.|$|E

5|$|Patton's {{colorful}} image, hard-driving {{personality and}} {{success as a}} commander were at times overshadowed by his controversial public statements. <b>His</b> <b>philosophy</b> of leading from the front {{and his ability to}} inspire troops with vulgarity-ridden speeches, such as a famous address to the Third Army, attracted favorable attention. His strong emphasis on rapid and aggressive offensive action proved effective. While Allied leaders held sharply differing opinions on Patton, he was regarded highly by his opponents in the German High Command. A popular, award-winning biographical film released in 1970 helped transform Patton into an American hero.|$|E

5|$|After {{twelve years}} of {{rigorous}} penance, {{at the age of}} forty-three Mahavira achieved the state of Kevala Jnana (omniscience or infinite knowledge) under a Sāla tree, according to traditional accounts. The details of this event are mentioned in Jain texts such as Uttar-purāņa and Harivamśa-purāņa. The Acharanga Sutra describes Mahavira as all-seeing. The Sutrakritanga elaborates the concept as all-knowing and provides details of other qualities of Mahavira. Jains believe that Mahavira had the most auspicious body (paramaudārika śarīra) and was free from eighteen imperfections when he attained omniscience. The Śvētāmbara believe that Mahavira traveled throughout India to teach <b>his</b> <b>philosophy</b> for thirty years after gaining omniscience. The Digambara, however, claim that after attaining omniscience, he sat fixed in his Samavasarana, giving sermons to his followers.|$|E
5|$|Aristotle (384–322 BC) {{studied at}} Plato's Academy in Athens, {{remaining}} {{there for about}} 20 years. Like Plato, he sought universals in <b>his</b> <b>philosophy,</b> but unlike Plato he backed up his views with detailed and systematic observation, notably of {{the natural history of}} the island of Lesbos, where he spent about two years, and the marine life in the seas around it, especially of the Pyrrha lagoon in the island's centre. This study made him the earliest scientist whose written work survives. No similarly detailed work on zoology was attempted until the sixteenth century; accordingly Aristotle remained highly influential for some two thousand years. He returned to Athens and founded his own school, the Lycaeum, where he taught for the last dozen years of his life. His writings on zoology form about a quarter of his surviving work. Aristotle's pupil Theophrastus later wrote a similar book on botany, Enquiry into Plants.|$|E

5|$|E.V. Ramasamy also {{blamed the}} capitalists for their control of machineries, {{creating}} difficulties for the workers. According to <b>his</b> <b>philosophy,</b> rationalism, {{which has to}} lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or scientific knowledge. An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the Tamil society in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.|$|E
5|$|He {{also wrote}} essays on film, {{published}} as the collections: Our Films, Their Films (1976), Bishoy Chalachchitra (1976), and Ekei Bole Shooting (1979).

The book contains articles and personal journal excerpts. The book {{is presented in two}} sections: Ray first discusses Indian film, before turning his attention toward Hollywood, specific filmmakers (Charlie Chaplin and Akira Kurosawa), and movements such as Italian neorealism. His book Bishoy Chalachchitra was published in translation in 2006 as Speaking of Films. It contains a compact description of <b>his</b> <b>philosophy</b> of different aspects of the cinemas.|$|E
5|$|In the 1913 session, Coolidge enjoyed renowned {{success in}} arduously {{navigating}} to passage the Western Trolley Act which connected Northampton {{with a dozen}} similar industrial communities in western Massachusetts. Coolidge intended to retire after his second term as was the custom, but when the President of the State Senate, Levi H. Greenwood, considered running for Lieutenant Governor, Coolidge decided to run again for the Senate {{in the hopes of}} being elected as its presiding officer. Although Greenwood later decided to run for reelection to the Senate, he was defeated primarily due to his opposition to women's suffrage; Coolidge was in favor of the women's vote, won his own re-election and with Crane's help, assumed the presidency of a closely divided Senate. After his election in January 1914, Coolidge delivered a published and frequently quoted speech entitled Have Faith in Massachusetts, which summarized <b>his</b> <b>philosophy</b> of government.|$|E

50|$|His views {{reflected}} {{those of}} Aristotle. <b>His</b> <b>philosophies</b> {{belonged to a}} group called “Semiramists,” which {{was a group of}} Aristotelians who believed in advocating dialectic interpretation of Aristotle’s learning, but also advocating the exposition of averroism.|$|R
50|$|Analyses of Weil’s work often split <b>his</b> {{practical}} <b>philosophy</b> and <b>his</b> theoretical <b>philosophy.</b> Following {{this traditional}} distinction largely inherited from Kant, {{we see the}} fullest expression of <b>his</b> theoretical <b>philosophy</b> in <b>his</b> Logique de la philosophie, and that of <b>his</b> practical <b>philosophy</b> in <b>his</b> Philosophie politique, and Philosophie morale. This distinction however is deceptive, because as is seen {{in all of these}} works and also in his numerous articles and critical studies, the distinction seems much less clear, and these two sides of his philosophical project mutually inform each other and work in unison. Nonetheless, there are significant distinctions between the two sides of Weil’s philosophy.|$|R
5|$|Periyar's {{philosophy}} of self-respect {{was based on}} his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. <b>His</b> <b>philosophy</b> preaches that human actions {{should be based on}} rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the {{philosophy of}} self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from rational thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.|$|E
5|$|Smuts's {{engagement}} with politics {{was very much}} a product of his time at Stellenbosch. While his parent's political moderation and rejection of Afrikaner exclusivism had left him largely unencumbered by any innate prejudices, it was his time at Victoria College which saw him develop his own independent political outlook. These views developed in tandem with another of Smuts's fixations, his philosophical pursuit of the embodiment of unity. This intellectual quest was later to develop into <b>his</b> <b>philosophy</b> of Holism, but even at this early undeveloped stage he brought these ideas to bear in shaping his political opinions. So it was that Smuts emerged as an outspoken supporter of South African unity, and, by extension, a supporter of Rhodes.|$|E
5|$|Swaminarayan {{developed}} {{a good relationship}} with the British Raj. He had followers not only from Hindu denominations but also from Islam and Zoroastrianism.

He died on 1 June 1830 and was cremated according to Hindu rites in Gadhada, Gujarat. Before his death, Swaminarayan appointed his adopted nephews as acharyas to head the two dioceses of Swaminarayan Sampraday. Swaminarayan is also remembered within the sect for undertaking reforms for women and the poor, and performing yajñas (fire sacrifices) on a large scale.|$|E
