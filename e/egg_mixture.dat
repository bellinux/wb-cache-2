2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{methods of}} holding a [...] reduced fracture involved using splints. [...] These are rigid strips laid parallel {{to each other}} alongside the bone. The Ancient Egyptians used wooden splints made of bark wrapped in linen. They also used stiff bandages for support that were probably derived from embalming techniques. The use of plaster of Paris to cover walls is evident, but it seems it was never used for bandages. [...] Ancient Hindus treated fractures with bamboo splints, and the writings of Hippocrates discuss management of fractures in some detail, recommending wooden splints plus exercise to prevent muscle atrophy during the immobilization. [...] The ancient Greeks also used waxes and resins to create stiffened bandages and the Roman Celsus, writing in AD 30, describes how to use splints and bandages stiffened with starch. Arabian doctors used lime derived from sea shells and albumen from egg whites to stiffen bandages. The Italian School of Salerno in the twelfth century recommended bandages hardened with a flour and <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> as did Medieval European bonesetters, who used casts made of egg white, flour, and animal fat. By the sixteenth century the famous French surgeon Ambroise Paré (1517–1590), who championed more humane treatments in medicine and promoted the use of artificial limbs, made casts of wax, cardboard, cloth, and parchment that hardened as they dried.|$|E
5000|$|There {{is always}} {{at least one}} {{optional}} ingredient, and such ingredients are combined with the beaten <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> while the eggs are still raw rather than being laid over the mostly cooked <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> before it is folded, as in a conventional omelette.|$|E

50|$|Bread {{and butter}} pudding is a {{traditional}} type of bread pudding popular in British cuisine. It is made by layering slices of buttered bread (often stale bread) scattered with raisins in an oven dish, over which an <b>egg</b> custard <b>mixture,</b> made with milk or cream and normally seasoned with nutmeg, vanilla or other spices, is poured. It is often served with custard or cream.|$|R
50|$|Paska is {{made with}} milk, butter, eggs, flour, and sugar, except in Romania, where the recipe most {{commonly}} includes sweet cream, cottage cheese, and/or sour cream along with eggs, sugar, raisins, and rum. An <b>egg</b> and water <b>mixture</b> {{is used as a}} glaze.|$|R
50|$|Angel food cake {{requires}} {{egg whites}} whipped {{until they are}} stiff; cream of tartar {{is added to the}} mixture to stabilize the egg whites. Remaining ingredients are gently folded into the <b>egg</b> white <b>mixture.</b> For this method of leavening to work well, it is useful to have flour that has been made of softer wheat; cake flour is generally used because of its light texture. The softer wheat and the lack of fat causes angel food cake to have a very light texture and taste.|$|R
50|$|Other solid {{ingredients}} (such as mushrooms, clams, or crab meat) {{may also}} {{be added to the}} mixture. The <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> is poured into a dish, which is then placed in a steamer and steamed until fully cooked. The eggs should be steamed until just firm, so that the texture of the eggs is still smooth and silky. A plate is usually placed on top of the bowl containing the <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> and left on while the egg is being steamed. Uncapped steamed eggs will have water on top of the finished dish due to the steam.|$|E
50|$|Homemade {{versions}} {{might include}} scallion, century egg, or dried shrimp. These additional ingredients {{are added to}} the <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> before steaming. It can also be enjoyed with soy sauce. The taste is usually savory (as opposed to a sweet custard).|$|E
50|$|Other recipes merely {{require that}} the {{ingredients}} are mixed together, like a savory bread pudding. A beaten <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> is then poured over the ingredients. The dish requires a rest of anywhere between one hour and overnight before it is baked. It is served warm.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1966 Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} with broilers and layers fed manually formulated or linear programmed rations. Experiments with broilers have involved the following: 1) determining the lysine requirement with and without cottonseed meal in the ration, 2) formulating by linear programming rations made up from different reported amino acid mixtures and 3) developing amino acid mixtures and formulating rations from these specifications using linear programming. The layer studies have involved: 1) developing rations using predicted rates of egg production based on the methionine need for egg production and 2) formulating by linear programming rations using various amino acid mixtures. In studying the lysine requirement of chicks, microbiological assays and chick experiments were used. Microbiological assays showed that the lysine content of cottonseed meal and the other selected feedstuffs exceeded the values {{reported in the literature}}. Results obtained from chick experiments indicated that both manually formulated and linear programmed rations meeting the reported lysine requirement of 1 percent resulted in depressed growth. The addition of lysine to these rations exhibited a significant growth response. It was concluded that the lysine requirement of chicks under conditions of these experiments was 1. 1 percent for rations containing calculated protein levels of 18. 4 and 21. 1 percent. The results comparing linear programmed rations formulated from different amino acid mixtures reported in the literature showed that the National Research Council's (NRC) amino acid mixture as well as the Dobson-Anderson mixture was inadequate from the standpoint of supporting maximum growth. The Klain mixture and the NRC mixture increased by 50 percent appeared capable of supporting optimum growth, while the Arscott-Brown mixture and the NRC mixture increased by 25 percent were considered optimum mixtures from an economic point of view. Experiments comparing developed amino acid mixtures and formulating rations using these specifications by linear programming indicated that the <b>egg</b> albumin-NRC <b>mixture</b> increased by 20 percent was capable of supporting optimum growth over the control <b>mixture</b> and the <b>egg</b> albumin-NRC <b>mixture.</b> There {{was no significant difference in}} body weights when the optimum <b>mixture</b> and the <b>egg</b> white-NRC <b>mixture</b> were compared. It was concluded that the <b>egg</b> albumin-NRC <b>mixture</b> increased by 20 percent more nearly meets the chick's amino acid needs than the NRC mixture. Layer studies involving manually formulated rations and using predicted rates of egg production based on the methionine need showed that there was no correlation between the predicted egg production rates and the rates of egg production obtained. The addition of methionine to these rations failed to improve rate of egg production. Explanations for these results were discussed. Layers fed linear programmed laying rations formulated from various amino acid mixtures showed no significant difference in rate of egg production between the control mixture versus the NRC mixture with or without upper amino acid restrictions or a ration developed from an amino acid mixture theoretically capable of supporting 100 percent of egg production. It was found that applying an upper limit to the NRC mixture appeared to have some adverse effect on egg production...|$|R

50|$|There is some {{suggestion}} that Welsh Rabbit derives from a South Wales Valleys staple, {{in which a}} generous lump of cheese is placed into a mixture of beaten eggs and milk, seasoned with salt and pepper, and baked in the oven until the <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> has firmed and the cheese has melted. Onion may be added and the mixture would be eaten with bread and butter and occasionally with the vinegar from pickled beetroot.|$|E
5000|$|The omelette {{commonly}} includes {{finely chopped}} green chili peppers and onions (or shallots), {{finely chopped fresh}} green coriander, salt, and zeera (cumin). Variations include grated coconut, ground black pepper, curry leaves, and finely chopped tomatoes. [...] Grated cheese may also be added. The <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> is whisked until fluffy and then cooked on a skillet. Usually the skillet is not warmed much before the mixture is poured in {{and it does not}} immediately solidify.

50|$|In Western countries, {{the dish}} usually {{appears as a}} well-folded omelette with the non-egg {{ingredients}} embedded in the <b>egg</b> <b>mixture,</b> covered in or served with sauce or gravy. Chinese chefs in the United States, at least {{as early as the}} 1930s, created a pancake filled with eggs, vegetables, and meat or seafood. In a U.S. regional variation, many American-Chinese restaurants in St. Louis, Missouri, serve what is called a St. Paul sandwich, which is an egg foo young patty served with mayonnaise, dill pickle, and sometimes lettuce and tomato between two slices of white bread.|$|E
2500|$|Century egg or Pidan (...) , {{also known}} as {{preserved}} egg, hundred-year egg, thousand-year egg, thousand-year-old egg, millennium egg and black egg, is a Chinese preserved food product and delicacy made by preserving duck, chicken or quail <b>eggs</b> in a <b>mixture</b> of clay, ash, salt, quicklime, and rice hulls for several weeks to several months, depending on the method of processing.|$|R
40|$|Water {{diffusion}} in the lamellar {{phase of}} egg phosphatidylcholine (egg PC) -water was studied by 1 H NMR using the pulsed field gradient-spin echo method. The curvature of diffusion plots obtained with <b>egg</b> PC-water <b>mixtures</b> indicates that water diffusion is highly anisotropic {{with respect to}} lipid lamellae. This was confirmed by measurements made on macroscopically aligned egg PC-water {{as a function of}} orientation that categorically establish DII/DI >>. 1, where the respective subscripts refer to parallel and perpendicular to the lipid bilayer. A smooth, monotonic dependence on water concentration was observed for water diffusion in aligned egg PC-water, varying at 25 degrees C from DII = 1. 2 x 10 (- 10) m 2 s 1 at n = 4. 9 mol water/lipid to DII = 4. 0 x 10 (- 10) m 2 s- 1 at n = 18. 6 mol water/lipid. The diffusion is approximately a factor of 10 slower than in pure water because of water binding and restriction to translational motion within the aqueous layer. No evidence for a sudden drop in water diffusion coefficient at a specific water content, as previously reported with <b>egg</b> PC-water <b>mixtures</b> (Lange and Gary Bobo. 1974. J. Gen. Physiol 63 : 690 - 706), was detected. A morphological reorganization of lamellar domains, which in random orientational distribution comprise lipid-water mixtures, is the likely explanation. The study of aligned lipid-water systems is manifestly preferable...|$|R

5000|$|In Thai cuisine, a {{traditional}} omelette is called khai chiao (khai meaning [...] "egg", and chiao meaning oil-fried), {{in which the}} beaten <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> and a small quantity of fish sauce is deep fried in a wok filled with 1-2 cups of vegetable oil and served over steamed rice. The dish is usually served with Sriracha sauce and cilantro. A variation on this dish is khai chiao songkhrueang, where the plain egg omelette is served together with a stir-fry of meat and vegetables. Yet another type of Thai omelette is kai yat sai, literally [...] "eggs filled with stuffing".|$|E
5000|$|Chawanmushi (4=literally [...] "tea cup steam" [...] or [...] "steamed in a tea bowl") is an egg custard dish {{found in}} Japan.

50|$|Today, bobotie is {{much more}} likely to be made with beef or lamb, {{although}} pork lends the dish extra moisture. Early recipes incorporated ginger, marjoram and lemon rind; the introduction of curry powder has simplified the recipe but the basic concept remains the same. Some recipes also call for chopped onions to be added to the mixture. Traditionally, bobotie incorporates dried fruit like raisins or sultanas. It is often garnished with walnuts, chutney and bananas. Although not particularly spicy, the dish incorporates a variety of flavours that can add complexity. For example, the dried fruit (usually apricots and raisins/sultanas) contrasts the curry flavouring. The texture of the dish is also complex, the baked <b>egg</b> <b>mixture</b> topping complementing the milk-soaked bread which adds moisture to the dish.|$|E

40|$|Many {{consumers}} {{do not follow}} recommended food safety practices for cooking egg dishes, such as pies, quiches, and casseroles, potentially leading to foodborne illnesses such as Salmonellosis. The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends cooking <b>egg</b> <b>mixtures</b> until the center reaches 71 °C (160 °F). The objectives {{of this study were}} to determine what endpoint temperature information consumers receive from egg dish recipes, and if recipes would lead to safe temperatures when followed. Egg dish recipes (n = 226) from 65 websites, 50 cookbooks, and nine magazine titles (multiple issues of each) were analyzed. Time was the most frequently used indicator, given in 92 % of the recipes, with 15 % using only time. Other indicators included: set (89), browned (76), clean toothpick/knife (60), puffed (27), and jiggled (13). Only two recipes indicated final endpoint temperatures. Three recipes (a pie, a quiche, and an egg casserole) were chosen and prepared in triplicate to see if they would reach recommended temperatures. The pie and quiche were still liquid at 71 °C, and were well over the recommended temperature when cooked according to instructions, but the egg casserole was not consistently above 71 °C, when the recipe instructions indicated it was done and the center was light brown and “jiggled” This research indicates that consumers are not receiving information on endpoint temperatures in egg recipes, but the likelihood of foodborne illness is low since most dishes probably be cooked past the recommended temperature before the consumer considers them done unless there are many inclusions that may absorb liquid and reduce the appearance of liquid in the dish...|$|R
