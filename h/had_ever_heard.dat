He searched amongst the ashes and found the burned Otto gas engine. This was the only one he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of or seen. He took it apart to see how it was constructed. It was a slide valve coal gas engine.|$|E
25|$|The diocese has {{historically}} had a somewhat high church ethos (note photographs of interiors {{of the original}} pro-cathedral {{in the town of}} Qu'Appelle and St Chad's Chapel on the former diocesan property in Regina), with significant early input by religious orders including the Sisters of St John the Divine who operated the St Chad’s Qu’Appelle Diocesan School until its closure. On the other hand, during the time of Michael Peers as Dean, Bruce McLeod, then Moderator of the United Church of Canada, visited Regina and departed from predecessors by visiting St Paul's Cathedral rather than any local United Church and was widely commented upon by parishioners as having delivered the best sermon they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b>|$|E
25|$|By all accounts, when Juan Diego, age 57, {{reported}} the apparition of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill in Mexico in 1531, {{he did not}} receive {{a lot of attention}} in Rome, since the Church was busy with the challenges of the Protestant Reformation of 1521 to 1579 and perhaps very few Cardinals in Rome <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the details of Mexico and its environs. Yet, just as {{a large number of people}} were leaving the Catholic Church in Europe as a result of the Reformation, Our Lady of Guadalupe was instrumental in adding almost 8 million people to the ranks of Catholics in the Americas between 1532 and 1538. The number of Catholics in South America has grown significantly over the centuries. Eventually with tens of millions of followers, Juan Diego had an effect on Mariology in the Americas and beyond, and was eventually declared venerable in 1987. Juan Diego was declared a saint in 2002. Furthermore, the Basilica of Our Lady of Guadalupe on Tepeyac hill in Mexico is now the third largest Catholic Church in the world, after Saint Peter's Basilica in Rome and the Basilica of the National Shrine of Our Lady of Aparecida in Brazil. Recent reported apparitions such as Medjugorje have also attracted a large following.|$|E

25|$|A {{television}} producer, {{working for}} producer Jack Webb, of Dragnet and Adam-12 fame, was in Los Angeles' UCLA Harbor Medical Center, doing background research for a proposed new TV show about doctors, when {{he happened to}} encounter these 'firemen who spoke like doctors and worked with them'. This novel idea would eventually evolve into the Emergency! television series, which ran from 1972–1977, portraying the exploits of a new group called 'paramedics'. The show {{captured the imagination of}} emergency services personnel, the medical community, and the general public. When the show first aired in 1972, there were only 6 full-fledged paramedic units operating in 3 pilot programs (Miami, Los Angeles, Seattle) in the whole of the United States. No one <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the term 'paramedic'; indeed, it is reported that one of the show's actors was initially concerned that the 'para' part of the term might involve jumping out of airplanes! By the time the program ended production in 1977, there were paramedics operating in every state. The show's technical advisor was a pioneer of paramedicine, James O. Page, then a Battalion Chief responsible for the Los Angeles County Fire Department 'paramedic' program, but who would go on to help establish other paramedic programs in the U.S., and to become the founding publisher of the Journal of Emergency Medical Services.|$|E

40|$|In the Indonesia Demographic Health Survey 1994 ever {{married women}} age 15 - 49 years {{were asked whether}} they <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> of AIDS and if so their sources of {{information}} concerning prevention and treatment of the disease, and their personal perception {{about the risk of}} getting the disease. Half of the women age 20 - 34 years <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> about AIDS and among the older women less than half of them <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> about it. This analysis describes information about the relationship between knowledge of ever married women 15 - 49 years about AIDS with various background characteristics - age, education, occupation, exposure to mass media, area, and regions. This information is required to improve the existing health education campaign about AIDS.   The results indicate that women with less than secondary education or married to husband with less than secondary education or women who do not work or working as farmers are less likely to <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> about AIDS. Women who are not exposed to any type of mass media or exposed to only one media are less likely to <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> about AIDS than those who are exposed to two or more media. The proportion of women who <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> about AIDS in outer Java Bali region is lower than in Java Bali region, likewise in the rural areas it is lower than in urban areas. There are significant associations between area, region, women' education, husbands' education, occupation, exposure to mass media and <b>having</b> <b>ever</b> heart about AIDS. The major source of information about AIDS are from TV and second are newspapers and radio. To control the transmission of HIV/ AIDS the role of mass media is very important and therefore it is necessary to improve the coverage and acceptability of the information considering mothers' education, region/area, and occupation. The information material should be simple and easily understood by the various social levels of community...|$|R

500|$|Hayward {{attempted}} {{to buy the}} rights from Michener outright, offering $500; Michener declined. [...] Although playwright Lynn Riggs had received 1.5% of the box office grosses {{for the right to}} adapt Green Grow the Lilacs into Oklahoma!, Michener never regretted accepting one percent of the gross receipts from South Pacific. [...] As Rodgers and Hammerstein began their work on the adaptation, Michener worked mostly with the lyricist, but Rodgers was concerned about the implications of the setting, fearing {{that he would have to}} include ukuleles and guitars, which he disliked. [...] Michener assured him that the only instrument he <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the natives play was an emptied barrel of gasoline, drummed upon with clubs.|$|E
500|$|Around eleven, {{the five}} {{warships}} began a salvo of broadside fire that flattened the flimsy American breastworks and panicked the Connecticut militia. [...] "So terrible and so incessant a roar of guns few {{even in the}} army and navy <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> before," [...] wrote Ambrose Serle, private secretary to Lord Howe. Nearly eighty guns fired at the shore for a full hour. The Americans were half buried under dirt and sand, and were unable to return fire due to the smoke and dust. After the guns ceased, the British flatboats appeared out of the smoke and headed for shore. By then the Americans were in a panicked retreat, and the British began their amphibious landing.|$|E

His speeches impressed many; even some of his opponents later conceded that Bryan was the most compelling speaker they <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard.</b> Bryan's speeches evolved over time; in December 1894, in a speech in Congress, he first used a phrase from which would come the conclusion to his most famous address: as originally stated, it was [...] "I will not help to crucify mankind upon a cross of gold." ...|$|E

[...] In response to Kaye's contention that Blaine invented the moniker to sell his book, Blaine denied that anyone <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>heard</b> the name [...] "The Clique".

[...] When asked why Reign in Blood has retained its popularity, King replied: [...] "If you released Reign in Blood today, no one would give a shit. It was timing; it was a change in sound.

And that was Bon's big idol, Little Richard. I think when he saw Brian at that time, to Bon it was 'Well he's a guy that knows what rock and roll is all about.' He mentioned that to us in Australia. I suppose when we decided to continue, Brian was the first name that Malcolm and myself came up with, so we said we should see if we can find him." ...|$|E

[...] "What I ended up doing was building a drum platform and designing some special little things, like a bass drum cover and a flat piece of wood that goes between the snare and the hi-hat" [...] Swedien later wrote. [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} there aren't many pieces of music where you can hear the first three or four notes of the drums, and immediately tell what the piece of music is."
