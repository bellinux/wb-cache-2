For comparison {{of air and}} molecular hydrogen recoveries, a laboratory Denver, type D 12, flotation machine was used. For both gases, pH of the suspension, gas flow rate, concentration of collector and frother, solids concentration, particle size and speed of impeller were kept constant. Almost identical recoveries were obtained for both gases, suggesting that gas composition played no significant role in silica flotation. <b>Electroflotation</b> experiments were carried out using 12. 6 μm mean diameter silica particles. While fine particles had very poor recovery in the Denver cell, greater than 70 % recoveries were achieved in the <b>electroflotation</b> cell.

40|$|This work employs {{digital image}} {{analysis}} to measure the size distribution of microbubbles generated {{by the process of}} <b>electroflotation</b> for use in solid/liquid separation processes. Microbubbles are used for separations in the mineral processing industry and also in the treatment of potable water and wastewater. As the bubbles move upward in a solid/liquid column due to buoyancy, particles collide with and attach to the bubbles and are carried {{to the surface of the}} column where they are removed by skimming. The removal efficiency of solids is strongly affected by the size of the bubbles. In general, higher separation is achieved by a smaller bubble size. The primary focus of this study was to characterize the size and size distribution of bubbles generated in <b>electroflotation</b> using image analysis.

40|$|A {{combined}} electrocoagulation and <b>electroflotation</b> {{process was}} designed to reduce Cr 6 + to Cr 3 + first and then to remove the total Cr from wastewater to a value below 0. 5 mg/L. Acidic condition was employed in the reduction of Cr 6 + and neutral conditions {{were found to be}} beneficial for the coagulation of the precipitates of Cr(OH) (3) and Fe(OH) (3). The formation of Fe(OH) (3) was ensured by sparging compressed air in the coagulation unit through a draft tube. The air not only oxidizes Fe 2 + produced electrically, but also helps to mix the water for a better coagulation of the particles. The two-stage <b>electroflotation</b> arrangement can separate the solids from the wastewater to a value of less than 3 mg/L with total Cr less than 0. 5 mg/L. The residence time required is about 1. 2 h. The optimal conditions for the treatment are: charge loading about 2. 5 Faradays/m(3) water, pH value in the coagulation unit is 5 - 8. The power consumption is less than 1 kW h/m(3) water at the conductivity of 1. 5 mS/cm.

40|$|<b>Electroflotation</b> and electrooxidation {{are the two}} {{attractive}} {{processes in}} wastewater treatment. However, the lack of ideal electrodes {{has long been a}} problem. This dissertation reports two types of high-performance electrodes, Ti/lrO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -SnO 2 and Ti/B-doped diamond (Ti/BDD), for <b>electroflotation</b> and electrooxidation, respectively. The Ti/lrO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -SnO 2 electrode developed {{in the present study was}} much more stable than the conventional Ti/lrO 2 electrode with 97. 5 percent of the precious Ir saved. The high stability of Ti/lrO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -SnO 2 with a low Ir content is attributed to the usage of conductive Sb-doped SnO 2 as a dispersing agent, the formation of a metastable solid solution, the interfacial bonding improvement, and the compact structure of the lrO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -SnO 2 film. An electrode system consisting of a fork-like Ti/lrO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -SnO 2 anode and a Ti cathode with a similar shape has been successfully applied to <b>electroflotation</b> to separate oil, suspended solids, fluorides, and Cr(lV) for over one year. The Ti/lrO 2 -Sb 2 O 5 -SnO 2 electrode still performs well for O 2 evolution without any noticeable deterioration in activity. Deposition of stable BDD films on titanium substrates is generally believed to be very difficult. In the present study, the durability of Ti/BDD electrodes has been improved significantly by optimizing the BDD film depositing conditions and using a proper organic additive. Different additives were investigated, and CH 2 (OCH 3) 2 was found to be the best one. The improved stability is attributed to the enhanced diamond nucleation and growth rates. In comparison with Ti/Sb 2 O 5 electrodes, the generally believed very active ones, the Ti/BDD electrodes obtained have 2 - 3 times higher current efficiencies in oxidizing various pollutants such as acetic acid, maleic acid, phenol, and dyes. A Ti/BDD electrode prepared from the H 2 + CH 4 + CH 2 (OCH 3) 2 gas mixture has been used for over 300 hours, and the superior activity remains. The successful development of the stable and active Ti/BDD electrodes significantly increases the feasibility of industrial application of electrooxidation to wastewater treatment...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} {{the removal of}} various (DyStar and CIBA) {{reactive}} dyestuffs (red - blue - yellow) and their trichromatic mixtures was examined by flotation techniques. The scope of this work was to demonstrate the feasibility of dispersed - air flotation (DispAF), dissolved - air flotation (DAF) and <b>electroflotation</b> (EF), {{in the treatment of}} simulated aqueous solutions and, consequently, of real industrial textile effluents, originating either from the dyeing reactor or from the equalization tank of a dye-house, bearing the same dyes as the simulated effluents. The main objectives were to characterize the experimental parameters affecting the three flotation processes, such as: the concentration and sort of dye (single dye solution, trichromatic mixture, real effluent), the concentration of added surfactants (CTAB, SDS), polyelectrolyte (Neoflock, PE) and flocculant (Zetag 87), the presence of electrolyte (NaCl) in the solution, the tension of the direct electric current (applied in <b>electroflotation).</b> To meet the demands of conservation of resources and sustainable development, this study was followed up by dyeing experiments and ultrasonic irradiation in order to investigate the possibility of water reuse and dyestuff degradation, respectively. The results of this study show that flotation seems to be an effective process for the removal of coloring matter from simulated effluents and textile industry effluents. Treated water could be totally reused in textile dyeing, if a small amount of supplement dye is used. The presence of collector in the effluent, in small quantities, favors the destruction of coloring matter. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{feature of}} <b>electro{{flotation}}</b> {{is the ability}} to create very fine bubbles, which are known to improve flotation performance of fine particles. This study was aimed at determining the hydrogen bubble size generated as a function of current density and electrode geometry. Experiments were performed in a viewing cell that allowed direct visualization of hydrogen bubbles being generated and transported away from platinum wire electrodes of 90, 120 and 190 μm in diameter. The detached bubble diameters varied between 15 and 23 μm in diameter, and for each wire diameter, were little influenced by the applied current in the range 150 – 350 A/m². The measurements were consistent with those predicted from a simple force balance analysis based on a H₂–Pt– 0. 2 M Na₂SO₄ contact angle of 0. 18 °. Interestingly, upon detachment, the bubble size increased rapidly, recording up to an 8 -fold increase in volume in the first few millimeters of rise, before approaching the steady state diameter of between 30 and 50 μm in the bulk. This increase in bubble size was found to be mostly due to the transfer of dissolve hydrogen into growing bubble while moving through the electrolyte super saturated by dissolved hydrogen gas. The equilibrium bulk diameter was found to be a function of the rate of hydrogen production, bubble nucleation rate, and dissolved gas concentration field. Consequently, <b>electroflotation</b> cells need to be designed to optimise the contact between the supersaturated liquid and the rising bubble plume. By doing this, the volumetric flux of bubbles will be maximised leading to improved flotation performance...|$|E

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Flotation of {{particles}} of diameter less than 10 μm is important economically yet recovery is very poor in conventional flotation machines where the bubble diameter is typically greater than 600 μm. Many {{studies have reported}} that flotation recovery of fine particles increases with decreased bubble size. <b>Electroflotation</b> can create very fine hydrogen and oxygen bubbles and may be a viable option to recover very fine particles. This study aims to develop an increased understanding {{of the principles of}} <b>electroflotation</b> and to use this knowledge to float very fine particles. The interaction between the gas phase with the mineral surface may bring about changes in the surface properties of the mineral, which can be either beneficial or detrimental in improving the flotation recovery. To investigate this interaction, flotation recovery of silica between air and molecular hydrogen was performed in a laboratory Denver, type D 12, flotation machine. For both gases, the pH of the suspension, gas flow rate, concentration of collector and frother, solids concentration, particle size and speed of impeller were kept constant. Almost identical recoveries were obtained for both gases, suggesting that gas composition played no significant role in silica flotation. There is wide variation in the reported measurements of bubble size in <b>electroflotation,</b> and uncertainty with the influence of electrode curvature, surface preparation and current density on bubble size have made it difficult to effectively design an efficient <b>electroflotation</b> system for fine particle recovery. Experiments were performed in a viewing cell that allowed direct visualization of hydrogen bubbles being generated and transported away from platinum wire electrodes of 90, 120 and 190 μm in diameter. It was found that the detached bubble diameter varied between 15 - 23 μm in diameter, and for each wire diameter, was little influenced by the applied current in the range 150 - 350 A/m². The measurements were consistent with those predicted from a simple force-balance analysis based on a H 2 -Pt- 0. 2 M Na₂SO₄ contact angle of 0. 18 °. Interestingly, upon detachment the bubble size increased rapidly, recording up to an 8 -fold increase in volume in the first few millimetres of rise, before approaching a steady state diameter of between 30 - 50 μm in the bulk. This increase in bubble size was found to be mostly due to the transfer of dissolve hydrogen into the growing bubble while moving through the electrolyte that was super-saturated with dissolved hydrogen. The equilibrium bulk diameter was found to be a function of the rate of hydrogen production, bubble nucleation rate, and dissolved gas concentration field. Consequently, it was concluded that in order to optimise <b>electroflotation</b> performance the cell geometry needed to be designed to optimise the contact between the supersaturated liquid and the rising bubble plume. By doing this, the volumetric flux of bubbles will be maximised leading to improved flotation performance. The influence of electrolyte flowrate past the electrode surface on resultant bubble size was also investigated. A peristaltic pump was used to a create a flow of electrolyte past 90 and 190 μm diameter platinum wire electrodes operating at a constant current density of 354 A/m². The superficial upward liquid velocity ranged from 1. 5 - 7. 1 mm/s. It was observed directly that the detachment diameter varied between 8 - 15 and 15 - 22 μm for the 90 and 190 μm diameter cathode wires, respectively. The corresponding bubble diameters in the bulk were found to be 14 - 31 and 30 - 43 μm, respectively. Both detachment and bulk bubble diameter decreased with increased superficial liquid velocity. Both bulk bubble size and <b>electroflotation</b> recovery are functions of the fraction of generated hydrogen that results in gas bubbles. Experimentally it was found that approximately 98 percent of the (theoretical) hydrogen produced by the electrolysis resulted in gas bubbles. This is a positive result, in that almost all of the electrical power is being converted to hydrogen (and oxygen) bubbles {{that can be used for}} flotation recovery. For a given current density, the rate of hydrogen gas production was largely independent of the concentration of the suspended solids. There was a very small increase in the hydrogen bubble production rate with the introduction of mechanical agitation, while the opposite trend was observed for the degassed electrolyte solution. Flotation of 3 - 15 μm diameter silica particles was carried out with electrolytically generated hydrogen bubbles with mean diameters of 30 and 40 μm. Fractional recoveries after two minutes of flotation were found to be 0. 82, 0. 90, 0. 96 and 0. 88 for the 3. 1, 5. 3, 12. 3 and 14. 7 μm diameter particles, respectively. The relatively high recoveries were directly attributed to the very small bubbles generated by the electrolysis process, which are known to increase flotation recovery for very fine particles. Finally, a flotation recovery model was developed which included a layered packing structure when estimating the fractional surface coverage of the bubble. Whilst it was not possible to measure surface coverage directly, the observed maximum plateau in flotation recovery appeared to occur when the bubble-particle aggregate projected area, based on a single layer particle packing, approached that of just the bubble. Moreover, flotation recovery was also found to be negatively influenced with a reduction in the bubble rise velocity due to attached particles...|$|E

These two steps were combined using a single vessel to grow marine (Pavlova pinguis) and fresh water (Chlorella vulgaris) microalgae. Combining growth {{and harvesting}} steps in a single vessel reduces capital as well as operation and maintenance (O&M) costs. Following the algae growth stage, biomass harvesting was obtained by <b>electroflotation</b> (EF) 2 ̆ 013 electrocoagulation (EC) using a series of flat aluminum electrodes. These electrodes were inserted into the reactor between aligned grooves drilled on opposing sides. Electrical energy consumption during the harvesting stage was optimized {{as a function of}} the size and number of electrodes, and current density. Concentrated algal biomass was collected from the tip surface using a scoop. After harvesting, the spent water was assayed for residual nutrients and adjusted for a second growth cycle. Characteristics of the second and first growth cycles were compared. Energy, capital and operations cost savings were estimated. Challenges and solutions of the proposed photobioreactor (PBR) design are presented. For example, to reduce heat load transparent conductive oxide (TCO) coated glass materials were used to construct the PBR. Our recently acquired data show that TCO coated glass improved algae growth by almost 50...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{hydrogen}} bubble <b>electroflotation</b> of 3 – 15 μm diameter silica particles was investigated. Experiments {{were conducted to}} {{determine the influence of}} current density, solids concentration, mechanical agitation and the presence of dissolved gases on the rate of hydrogen gas production. It was found that approximately 98 % of the theoretical hydrogen production resulted in gas bubbles. There was a very small increase in the hydrogen bubble production rate with the introduction of mechanical agitation, while the opposite trend was observed for the degassed electrolyte solution. Hydrogen gas production was found to be largely independent of the concentration of the suspended solids. Batchwise flotation experiments were also undertaken to determine the influence of particle diameter and solids concentration on flotation recovery. The experimental results were inputted into a recovery model, based largely on the work of Koh and Schwarz [1], that was applied to gain insight into the factors that influence the fractional coverage of the bubble surface by the particles. From the analysis it was found that, for this study at least, flotation recovery was controlled by either the bubble–particle aggregate rise velocity being greater than zero or the bubble–particle aggregate projected area being less than that of just the bubble...|$|E
40|$|The article {{presents}} the authors’ {{analysis of the}} industrial wastewater treatment and recycling technologies based on conventional technologies. It is pointed out that conventional electroplating waste water treatment plants in Russian Federation have several disadvantages, such relatively high operating costs and low wastewater processing efficiency. Thus electroplating wastewater treatment plants have to be modernized according to Best Available Technologies (BAT). A modern electroplating wastewater treatment and recycling technology based on BAT such as <b>electroflotation,</b> ultrafiltration and industrial reverse osmosis has been developed and successfully implemented at several RF industrial enterprises. The represented system is free from the disadvantages such as conventional wastewater processing technologies have. It allows to achieve integrated treatment of electroplating wastewater from heavy metal ions down to 0, 04 mg/l and from oil products down to 0, 05 mg/l within low power and chemicals consumptions with further water reuse, significantly reducing water disposal and WWTPs operating costs and thus ensuring the profitability of WWTPs usage {{and as a result}} electroplating industry in general.

30|$|With the world’s rapid {{population}} growth, the water pollution {{has become a}} serious global problem for the indiscriminate discharge of wastewater. Therefore, more efficient and cost-saving wastewater treatment technologies are vital to satisfy the ever-increasing requirements of human beings. Generally, wastewater treatment is {{carried out by the}} conventional wastewater treatment process (Grady Jr et al. 2011; Afzal et al. 2011), such as, physical–chemical methods and biological methods. However, it is difficult to degrade the complex refractory organic pollutant in the wastewater by biological methods. In addition, physical–chemical methods are not always effective due to the unreacted chemicals and sludge treatment (Feng et al. 2003; Afzal et al. 2011). Nowadays, electrochemical technology, which was applied to water and wastewater treatment, has attracted great attention for its environmental compatibility, high removal efficiency, and potential cost effectiveness. Electrochemical technology including electrocoagulation, electrodeposition, electrooxidation, electrodisinfection, electrofenton, <b>electroflotation,</b> and electrosorption, {{may be one of the}} most effective technologies. Among them, electrodisinfection process (Ghernaout and Ghernaout 2010), which is extremely popular in recent years, has great potential to eliminate and disinfect drinking water, swimming pool water and industrial cooling water. Compared with electrodisinfection, electrofenton was widely applied in the treatment of wastewater containing toxic and non-biodegradable materials (Jiang and Zhang 2007). In addition, <b>electroflotation</b> technology was used in the elimination of flocs and suspended sludge of wastewater (Chen et al. 2002; Ge et al. 2004), while electrosorption technology effectively removed polar molecules or ions from wastewater (Huang and Su 2010). However, electrocoagulation, electrodeposition and electrooxidation still were the uppermost electrochemical technologies during water and wastewater treatment in the history. Electrooxidation, which was extensively investigated since the late 1970 s (Mayeda et al. 1972; Nilsson et al. 1973), had been used worldwide in various refractory wastewater treatments, such as textile wastewater (Andrade et al. 2007), olive mill wastewater (Un et al. 2008), distillery industry wastewater (Piya-Areetham et al. 2006), dye-containing wastewater (Valero et al. 2010), brown-colored molasses wastewater (Canizares et al. 2008), and coking wastewater (Zhu et al. 2009). Recently, researchers have paid more concern on anodic material of electrodes and its electrochemical performance and degradation mechanism (Marselli et al. 2003; Chen 2004; Chang et al. 2009). The common electrodes (Gao et al. 1994; Chen 2004; Martinez-Huitle and Ferro 2006; Anglada et al. 2009; Zhu et al. 2009), such as, graphite, Pt, PbO 2, SnO 2, Ti/Pt, Ti/SnO 2, Ti/PbO 2, Ti/RuO 2 –TiO 2, Ti/IrO 2 –TiO 2, Ti/IrO 2 –RuO 2 –TiO 2, boron-doped diamond electrode (BDD), Titanium-based boron-doped diamond electrode (BDD/Ti) are usually found in the wastewater treatment field. Moreover, novel anodic material will be the future frontier of electrochemical technology for water and wastewater treatment related research.|$|E
40|$|Embora todas as etapas do processo de produÃÃo de {{biodiesel}} a partir de microalgas sejam essenciais, a separaÃÃo e a ruptura celular da biomassa sÃo particularmente importantes, uma vez que as tecnologias disponÃveis para este fim apresentam elevados custos, comprometendo a viabilidade do aproveitamento energÃtico. Este trabalho teve como objetivo apontar um sistema que conseguisse aliar a separaÃÃo da biomassa algal de efluente de sistemas de lagoas de estabilizaÃÃo Ã ruptura celular, como uma alternativa de prÃ-tratamento para maximizar a extraÃÃo de lipÃdios pelo mÃtodo modificado de Bligh e Dyer; assim como estudar preliminarmente a comunidade fitoplanctÃnica presente para comparaÃÃo dos rendimentos lipÃdicos. Um reator de eletroflotaÃÃo nÃo-convencional foi confeccionado para operar em batelada e em fluxo contÃnuo, utilizando-se eletrodos nÃo consumÃveis e baixa potÃncia elÃtrica. A metodologia proposta foi comparada com tÃcnicas tradicionalmente utilizadas para ruptura celular: autoclave, micro-ondas e ultrassom. Foram selecionadas seis estaÃÃes de tratamento de esgotos (ETE) com diferentes configuraÃÃes de lagoas de estabilizaÃÃo para anÃlise dos gÃneros fitoplanctÃnicos dominantes e do teor lipÃdico. Observou-se a separaÃÃo da biomassa, sendo obtida eficiÃncia de remoÃÃo de turbidez superior a 80 % em 20 minutos de operaÃÃo do reator em batelada. Entre os mÃtodos de prÃ-tratamento tradicionais testados, o micro-ondas foi o que apresentou maior rendimento lipÃdico (33, 7 Â 5, 3 %), diferente estatisticamente da autoclave (15, 4 Â 2, 26 %) e ultrassom (13, 3 Â 2, 96 %). Para a eletroflotaÃÃo nÃo-convencional o rendimento lipÃdico foi de 24, 8 Â 7, 05 %, que nÃo apresentou diferenÃa estatÃstica quando comparado ao micro-ondas. Entretanto, quando os custos energÃticos foram considerados, a eletroflotaÃÃo nÃoconvencional apresentou um custo de 5, 6 Wh. g- 1, sendo menor que o obtido para o micro-ondas. Os gÃneros de microalgas que predominaram nos efluentes analisados pertenciam Ãs classes Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae e Euglenophyceae. Em uma anÃlise quantitativa geral, os efluentes de todas as estaÃÃes analisadas apresentaram rendimento lipÃdico entre 8, 5 e 34, 6 %. Os efluentes das ETE Aquiraz e TupÃ-Mirim apresentaram os maiores teores lipÃdicos (28, 4 Â 6, 3 % e 23, 1 Â 3, 6 %, respectivamente), sem diferenÃa estatÃstica (p= 0, 12). Os efluentes das ETE Araturi e TabapuÃ apresentaram os menores potenciais lipÃdicos, sem diferenÃa estatÃstica entre eles (14, 3 Â 5, 9 % e 15, 6 Â 4, 9 %, respectivamente, p= 0, 68). A eletroflotaÃÃo nÃo-convencional mostrou-se como uma metodologia promissora para separaÃÃo e ruptura das cÃlulas de microalgas de efluentes de lagoas de estabilizaÃÃo, cujos potenciais lipÃdicos assemelharam-se aos obtidos a partir de biomassa microalgal cultivada em processos convencionais. AlÃm disso, a metodologia desenvolvida neste trabalho soma um motivo para a separaÃÃo e utilizaÃÃo da biomassa algal de lagoas de estabilizaÃÃo evitando, com isso, seu lanÃamento nos corpos dÂÃgua e garantindo um ganho econÃmico e ambiental, uma vez que visa o aproveitamento da biomassa para a produÃÃo de biocombustÃvel, ao passo que minimiza impactos ambientais decorrentes da presenÃa elevada desse material no ambiente. Although {{all stages}} {{on the production}} of biodiesel from microalgae cells are essential, harvest and cell disruption biomass are particularly important, since the available technologies for this purpose present high cost, compromising energy recovery viability. This study aimed to develop a system that could combine separation of algal biomass from wastewater stabilization pond systems to cell disruption as an alternative of pretreatment to maximize total lipids extraction by the modified method of Bligh and Dyer, as well as perform a preliminary study of the phytoplankton for comparison of lipid content. A non-conventional <b>electroflotation</b> reactor was designed to operate in batch and continuous flow, using non-consumable electrodes and low electrical power. The proposed methodology was compared to traditional techniques used for cell disruption: autoclave, microwave and ultrasound. Six Wastewater Treatment Plant (WTP) with different pond configuration were selected for analysis of the dominant phytoplankton genera and lipid content. Biomass separation was achieved, with turbidity removal efficiency exceeding 70 % in 20 minutes of operation with the batch reactor. Among the traditional pretreatment methods tested, the microwave showed the highest lipid yield (33. 7 Â 5. 3 %), followed by autoclave (15. 4 Â 2. 26 %) and ultrasound (13. 3 Â 2. 96 %). For non-conventional <b>electroflotation</b> methodology, lipid yield was 24. 8 Â 7. 05 %, which showed no statistical difference {{when compared to the}} microwave method. However, when energy cost was considered, non-conventional <b>electroflotation</b> presented a cost of 5. 6 Wh. g- 1, which was smaller than that obtained by the microwave method. The predominant microalgae genera in the analyzed effluents belonged to the classes Chlorophyceae, Cyanophyceae and Euglenophyceae. In a general quantitative analysis, the effluents from the analyzed ponds presented lipid yield between 8. 5 and 34. 6 %. Effluents of the WTP Aquiraz and TupÃ-Mirim achieved the highest lipid content (28. 4 Â 6. 3 % and 23. 1 Â 3. 6 %, respectively), with no statistical difference (p = 0. 12). Effluents of the WTP Araturi and TabapuÃ achieved the lowest lipidic potential, with no statistical difference (14. 3 Â 5. 9 % and 15. 6 Â 4. 9 %, respectively, p = 0. 68). Non-conventional <b>electroflotation</b> proved to be a promising methodology for harvesting and cell disruption of microalgae provided by effluent stabilization ponds, whose potential lipid resembled those obtained from microalgal biomass cultivated in conventional processes. Furthermore, the methodology developed in this work adds a reason for the harvesting and utilization of algal biomass from waste stabilization ponds avoiding, thus, its release into water bodies and ensuring an environmental and economic gain, since it aims the use of biomass for biofuel production, while minimizing environmental impacts due to elevated presence of this material on the environment...|$|E
40|$|A {{kinetic study}} of defluoridation of {{drinking}} water was carried out using the electrocoagulation/ <b>electroflotation</b> process in two batch reactors of identical volume (20 L) : a stirred tank reactor (STR) and an external-loop airlift reactor (ALR). When the evolution of fluoride content was independent of stirring speed, experimental {{results showed that the}} kinetics of fluoride removal could be modelled using a variable-order-kinetic (VOK) approach coupled with a Langmuir–Freundlich adsorption model in the STR. Conversely, when mixing was less efficient, which is the case in the ALR, experimental data could be fitted adequately only using a pseudo-first-order model. The variable order kinetic (VOK) model derived from the langmuir-freundlish equation was applied to determine the kinetics of fluoride removal reaction by electrocoagulation (EC). Synthetic solutions were employed to elucidate the effects of the initial fluoride concentration, the applied current and the initial acidity on the simulation results of the model. The proposed model successfully describes the fluoride removal in Airlift reactor in comparison with the experimental results. In this study two EC cells with the same capacity (V= 20 L) were used to carry out fluoride removal with aluminum electrodes, the first is a stirred tank reactor (STR) the second is an airlift reactor (ALR). The comparison of energy consumption demonstrates that the (ALR) is advantageous for carrying out the defluoridation removal process...|$|E
40|$|Polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) {{is a type}} of {{thermoplastic}} resin generated by a polymerization of vinyl acetate. Effluent of this polymer is highly rich with chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total solids (TS). Due to lack of studies on the above problem, the current study aimed at obtaining a sufficient method for the effluent pre-treatment. In fact, the study discussed PVAC effluent treatment by electrocoagulation (EC) and <b>electroflotation</b> processes. The study considered the effect of various operating parameters such as pH and current density, initial concentration of pollutant, inter-electrode distance, electrolysis times, and types of electrode materials (iron and aluminum); COD and TS removal efficiency and optimal values of operational parameters were calculated. In the study, COD and TS reduction rates in the optimized conditions in batch flow reactor were 83 % and 78 %, and 80 % and 72 % for Fe and Al electrodes, respectively. Optimized conditions were taken as 24 mA cm - 2, 20 g/L PVAC, and neutral pH in 20 minutes for Al-Al electrodes and 15 minutes for Fe-Fe electrodes, 1 cm distance between electrodes with parallel-type monopole of connection modes. According to the results, electrochemical process with batch flow tends to be a suitable pre-treatment process that is inexpensive, easily operated, and highly sufficient for effluent treatment, which contains polyvinyl acetate...|$|E
