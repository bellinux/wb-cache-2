40|$|Abstract: Polishing of {{harvested}} turmeric is {{a bigger}} problem for the turmeric producers in an India. The customer {{is in need of}} high quality polished turmeric for making turmeric powder. In this regard there is a need of polishing machine for washing turmeric to remove unwanted impurities and scales of harvested turmeric. The paper presents the new design of turmeric polishing machine which is based on designed for manufacturing, assembly and maintenance. The phenomenon of abrasion used <b>in</b> <b>polishing,</b> which is caused by the friction between expanded wired metal mesh and turmeric. The scale and unwanted impurities are fallen down on the base easily, which seems to be quite difficult <b>in</b> hand <b>polishing.</b> The designed machine is very simple in operation, efficient <b>in</b> <b>polishing</b> of harvested turmeric at a good speed of production. This machine seems very simple at same time very efficient <b>in</b> <b>polishing</b> about 50 kg of harvested turmeric at a speed about of 75 rpm for about 20 min...|$|R
