500|$|A San Francisco Chronicle {{review of}} a 2012 concert judged her singing [...] "an {{impressive}} thing to witness, and Evancho's technical precision and enormous range only serve {{to make it seem}} less fluky", but felt that [...] "every selection sounded alike". A reviewer for The Denver Post wrote that Evancho [...] "displayed her famous combo of poise and articulation", but he noted [...] "the burden of being a kid soprano, a true phenomenon. People pay a lot to see you and orchestras line up to get you on their stage. But still folks wonder if you really comprehend your life; if you shouldn’t be <b>home</b> ... <b>eating</b> ice cream. ... And yet they rise to their feet, yet again, as you finish." [...] A Naples Daily News review stated: [...] "Her poise. Her control. Her range. ... Her voice and her performance exhausted all of the superlatives in the dictionary." [...] In 2013, an Atlanta reviewer commented: [...] "Her pure and well-formed vowel sounds touched the hearts of everyone at the concert." [...] A review in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution called Evancho [...] "awesomely talented" [...] and [...] "technically flawless". The Buffalo News reviewer wrote: [...] "there is a poignancy to the sound of this mature voice coming out of this child. Her high notes are a joy." ...|$|E
2500|$|On February 20, 2010, Haltzman, Robbins' counsel, told MSNBC Live that Robbins {{had been}} sitting in his <b>home</b> <b>eating</b> [...] "Mike and Ike" [...] candy in front of his school-issued laptop. [...] The {{attorney}} said that the vice-principal had accused Robbins of taking illegal pills after seeing him eating the candy in a webcam image. [...] Michael Smerconish, a Philadelphia Inquirer columnist who reviewed the photo, said that it did in fact appear to be the same size and shape as Mike and Ike candy. [...] Haltzman said that his client's laptop had not been reported stolen or lost. [...] The lawyer also raised questions as to who in the school system decided when to activate each student's webcam, and for what reasons.|$|E

6000|$|Like {{many of the}} cocksure {{young men}} who forage about cities in {{apparent}} contentment and who express their cynicism in supercilious slang, Escott was shy and lonely.

60|$|I did a morning's task, and was {{detained}} late at the Court; came <b>home,</b> <b>ate</b> a hearty dinner, slumbered after it {{in spite of}} my teeth, and made a poor night's work of it.

It was only when I saw him really unhappy that I felt really vexed with the fair, frail cause of his suffering.|$|E

60|$|Once upon a {{time there}} lived a poor woman who had only one child, {{and he was a}} little boy called Hassebu. When he ceased to be a baby, and his mother thought it was time for him to learn to read, she sent him to school. And, after he had done with school, he was put into a shop to learn how to make clothes, and did not learn; and he was put to do silversmith's work, and did not learn; and {{whatsoever}} he was taught, he did not learn it. His mother never wished him to do anything he did not like, so she said: 'Well, stay at home, my son.' And he stayed at <b>home,</b> <b>eating</b> and sleeping.|$|E
60|$|Influenced by the {{contents}} of the Bugle, there is an impression general at this ranch that you are president, secretary, and committee, &c., of the various associations of fruit fairs, sewing societies, church fairs, Presbytery, general assembly, conference, medical conventions, and baby shows that go to make up the glory and renown of North Carolina in general, and while I heartily congratulate the aforesaid institutions on their having such a zealous and efficient officer, I tremble lest their requirements leave you not time to favor me with a letter in reply to this, and assure you that if you would so honor me I would highly appreciate the effort. I would rather have a good long letter from you than many Bugles. In your letter be certain to refer as much as possible to the advantages of civilized life over the barbarous; you might mention the theatres you see there, the nice things you eat, warm fires, niggers to cook and bring in wood; a special reference to nice beef-steak would be advisable. You know our being reminded of these luxuries makes us contented and happy. When we hear of you people at <b>home</b> <b>eating</b> turkeys and mince pies and getting drunk Christmas and having a fine time generally we become more and more reconciled to this country and would not leave it for anything.|$|E
6000|$|Dolph found, {{as he had}} suspected, {{that the}} shot from the glen, which had come so near giving him his quietus when on the precipice, was from the party before him. He had nearly crushed one of them by the {{fragment}} of rock which he had detached; and the jovial old hunter, in the broad hat and buck-tail, had fired {{at the place where}} he saw the bushes move, supposing it to be some wild animal. He laughed heartily at the blunder; it being what is considered an exceeding good joke among hunters; [...] "but faith, my lad," [...] said he, [...] "if I had but caught a glimpse of you to take sight at, you would have followed the rock. Antony Vander Heyden is seldom known to miss his aim." [...] These last words were at once a clue to Dolph's curiosity; and a few questions let him completely into the character of the man before him, and of his band of woodland rangers. The commander in the broad hat and hunting-frock, was no less a personage than the Heer Antony Vander Heyden, of Albany, of whom Dolph had many a time heard. He was, in fact, the hero of many a story; being a man of singular humours and whimsical habits, that were matters of wonder to his quiet Dutch neighbours. As {{he was a man of}} property, having had a father before him, from whom he inherited large tracts of wild land, and whole barrels full of wampum, he could indulge his humours without control. Instead of staying quietly at <b>home,</b> <b>eating</b> and drinking at regular meal times; amusing himself by smoking his pipe on the bench before the door, and then turning into a comfortable bed at night; he delighted in all kinds of rough, wild expeditions. He was never so happy as when on a hunting party in the wilderness, sleeping under trees or bark sheds, or cruising down the river, or on some woodland lake, fishing and hunting, and living the Lord knows how.|$|E
