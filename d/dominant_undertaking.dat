D Abstract: This thesis {{deals with the}} doctrine of special {{responsibility of}} the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> and related issues. The special responsibility of the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> is the obligation not to allow its conduct to impair genuine undistorted competition on the common market. The doctrine of the special responsibility {{is tied to the}} prohibition on abuse of such position. One concept could not be assessed without the other, because the concept of special responsibility of the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> is a fundamental principle for the application of the prohibition on abuse of such position. Based on {{that it is necessary to}} describe in this thesis the prohibition on abuse of dominant position together with selected prohibited practices, in which the special responsibility of the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> is reflected. This responsibility presupposes a higher standard of vigilance reflected in the conduct of such an undertaking, because an undertaking in dominant position on the relevant market could not take all actions that the other undertakings lacking such market power could do. The question of the superdominant undertakings and the scope of [...] ...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} focalizes on {{the relationship}} between the exercise of administrative power and the application of antitrust rules. In particular, the application of article 102 TFEU in relation to the participation of <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> within administrative proceedings is investigated. The aim of the research is to examine the boundaries between the prohibition set forth at Article 102 TFEU and the exercise of the dominant undertaking’s administrative participative rights. From another perspective, the analysis concerns the identification of possible criteria capable of resolving (or avoiding) the conflict between the application of antitrust rules and the exercise of constitutional rights, such as that of democratic participation to the public life and the right to petition the Government. In this regard, an important role could be played by the abuse of rights theory. The antitrust rules should apply only in relation to behaviours of the dominant firm, which do not represent a genuine exercise of its participative rights. The research is structured as follows. The first Chapter, after a brief introduction to the applicative principles of article 102 TFEU, focuses on the application of antitrust rules against State measures. The conclusion reached is that antitrust should apply only in cases where the public authority have delegated their power to private interested parties, without sufficient supervision on how such power is exercised by the private operators. The second chapter is entirely dedicated the application of Article 102 TFUE vis-à-vis the participation of a <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> within administrative/regulatory proceedings. The research concludes that elements such as, (i) the discretionary power of the public administration; (ii) the nature and effects of the administrative decision; as well as (iii) the principle of uniformity of the legal order, act as limits to the application of Article 102 TFEU. On the contrary, Article 102 TFEU shall apply in all cases when the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> abuses its participative rights for an anticompetitive purpose. Hence, the third chapter of the thesis investigates the relationship between abuse of dominant position and abuse of rights theory/legal principle. The thesis is then concluded by a fourth chapter, which shows that some of the arguments treated in the precedent chapters reveal general trends of the legal order. This is, for instance, the case with the pluri-qualification phenomenon (i. e. the qualification of the conduct by different branches of the legal system), {{as well as with the}} abuse of rights principle.

40|$|A <b>dominant</b> firm <b>undertakes</b> a given {{business}} {{practice that}} is regulated by an antitrust enforcer by {{the choice of}} a legal standard, fines and accuracy. In traditional industries the incumbent and technology are already established, while in innovative industries the successful innovator becomes dominant. In the former case, marginal deterrence is key to enforcement, and discriminating rules are always dominant when fines are unbounded, or they are replaced with per-se illegality when fines are capped and the practice is likely to be socially harmful. In innovative industries marginal deterrence interacts with average deterrence (the impact of enforcement on innovation effort). Then, per-se legality is preferred when the practice is likely to be welfare beneficial, moving to a discriminating rule when social harm becomes more likely. When fines are capped, per se-legality, discriminating rule and per-se illegality are alternatively chosen when the practice is more and more likely to be socially harmful. ...|$|R

40|$|This essay explores two {{different}} but related problems and how U. S. antitrust law and EU competition law approach them. The {{first is the}} offense of attempt to monopolize, which concerns the acts that a firm that is not yet <b>dominant</b> might <b>undertake</b> {{in order to become}} dominant. The second is the offense of monopoly or dominant firm leveraging, which occurs when a firm uses its dominant position in one market to cause some kind of harm in a different market where it also does business. The language of EU and U. S. provisions concerning dominant firms provokes one to think that the differences between them are significant. The Sherman Act includes an express attempt to monopolize claim while Article 82 does not. Article 822 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 abuse of dominance 2 ̆ 2 language invites in a concept of non-monopolistic leveraging while the U. S. antitrust law is moving in the opposite direction. In practice, the differences are not so great, although they should not be minimized either. Further, when one looks at the full range of competition laws and not just the provisions respecting unilateral conduct by dominant firms, then the differences appear to result more from the happenstance of statutory drafting than from significant differences concerning the scope of unlawful single-firm conduct...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{ultimate}} {{objective of}} EC competition rules {{is arguably the}} enhancement of ‘consumer welfare’. In EC competition law, however, ‘consumer ’ merely means ‘customer’. Not being limited to final consumers, the concept also encompasses intermediate customers. Moreover, according to the EC Commission, under Article 82 EC, harm to intermediate customers is generally presumed to create harm to consumers and where intermediate customers are not competitors of the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking,</b> there is no requisite to assess the effects of conduct on users further downstream. This paper questions the appropriateness of this presumption {{in light of recent}} advances in economics, specifically that of vertical restraints and in particular non-linear pricing. It uses this literature to show that there are many instances where an increase (decrease) in ‘customer welfare ’ does not cause an increase (decrease) in ‘consumer welfare’. In these cases, the presumption is devoid of economic justification and likely to lead to decisional errors. The paper concludes that if the law is to serve the interests of ‘real ’ consumers, the EC Commission should reconsider this presumption and its interpretation of the ‘consumer ’ in ‘consumer welfare’. Until then, it remains questionable and objectionable whose interests EC competition law and in particular, Article 82 EC, serve...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the main}} {{objectives}} of the European Community (EC) is to avoid the distortion of competition in the internal market. This aim is to be achieved {{through the application of}} the more detailed competition provisions in the EC Treaty, namely the Articles 81 and 82. Article 82 states that any abusive conduct of a <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> which may affect trade between Member States is prohibited. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has, through a wide stream of judgements, set the frame for which conducts that may be considered as abusive. These judgements have also {{led to the development of}} the so called “essential facilities doctrine” in EC law, which concerns the grant of access to a facility or resource controlled by a dominant firm. The central concept of the essential facilities doctrine is that a dominant firm's refusal to provide access to something it owns or controls, to which the access for other firms is essential in order for them to provide products or services to customers, may be held as abusive and therefore also prohibited. This means that a <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> may have a duty to share its facilities – which it many times has developed during many years – with competitors. A broad application of the essential facilities doctrine could therefore risk removing incentives for research and innovation, as it would become less fruitful for undertakings to invest in such facilities. On the other hand, if the essential facility is a monopoly asset of a <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking,</b> a non-application of the essential facilities doctrine could allow the undertaking to set abusively high access prices or to permanently exclude competition on the related market by refusing to share the facility. The essential facilities doctrine was first developed in cases where a dominant firm refused to supply a physical facility to other firms. In more recent cases, however, the European courts have also held a dominant firm's refusal to license intellectual property (IP) rights as infringing Article 82. 6 The reason for such an approach has mainly been that exclusive rights, such as IP rights, give the right-holder a temporary monopolistic position and that a refusal to license therefore may lead to the elimination of all competition on the market as it will be impossible for competitors to enter that market without a license. Thus, in exceptional cases, the exercise of exclusive rights, in means of a refusal to license, has been prohibited by Article 82. One particular area of refusal to license concerns “interface information” within the information technology sector. Interface information is such information that providers of software need in order to create products which can operate with other programs and systems. This information is many times either protected by IP rights, such as patent or copyright, or kept as a non-patented know-how and thus only protected by its secret nature. In a recent judgement of the European Court of First Instance (CFI) Microsoft was held to infringe Article 82 by refusing to license secret interface information. This case is highly interesting not only because it may clarify the relation between EC competition law and IP rights in essential facilities cases, but also because of the way the CFI equalled secret information – know-how – with other IP rights in its judgement by stating that “… there is no reason why secret technology should enjoy a higher level of protection than, for example, technology which has necessarily been disclosed to the public by its inventor in a patent-application procedure. ” As mentioned above, one {{of the main}} reasons for competition rules to interfere with exclusive rights is that such rights may give the owner a legally protected monopolistic position for a longer period and that it is feared that the exercise of exclusive rights may eliminate all competition in that area from the market. This is however not the case with trade secrets which, once they are revealed, cannot be protected from other's exploitation. One may therefore question if trade secrets in reality endanger competition to the same extent than IP rights...|$|E
40|$|Doctrine of {{essential}} facilities under Czech and European law "Essential facilities doctrine" {{is a term}} used to describe {{a set of rules}} concerned with a <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> refusing to supply a crucial resource, over which it holds an exclusive control, to its competitors who need the resource to remain in business.

50|$|As Tsushima had {{suffered}} greatly from its loss of trade with Korea {{as a result}} of the invasions, Yoshitoshi of the Sō family, then <b>dominant</b> in Tsushima, <b>undertook</b> the lead in the peace negotiations by Japan. He sent four peace missions to Joseon in 1599 to normalize relations.

As Ming troops continued to be present in Korea following the withdrawal of Japanese forces, the major incentive for Joseon for the normalization of relations with Japan was the withdrawal of the Chinese soldiers from their territory. The Ming Chinese themselves were causing as much havoc as the Japanese had during the actual conflict, and their presence continued to strain the local economy and infrastructure. In response to the Joseon request, Yoshitoshi promptly released several Joseon prisoners and between 1603 and 1604 helped the Joseon envoys to repatriate a further 3,000 by organizing negotiations at Kyoto with Tokugawa Ieyasu, by then the Shogun of Japan.|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{explores the}} {{interface}} between competition law and market integration, {{in the application of}} Article 102 TFEU. It focuses on ‘market separation’ and addresses conduct that has the intent, or effect, of hindering cross-border trade, either in the form of geographic price discrimination or in the form of exclusionary abuses, in which out-of-State competitors are affected. In doing so, the thesis delves into a comparative analysis of the Treaty requirements under Article 102 TFEU when applied in market separation cases and the Treaty requirements under the free movement provisions. It begins with a comparison of the objectives of the two sets of provisions and assesses how their historical link is echoed, presently, in the requirement of ‘effect on trade’ under Article 102 TFEU (Chapter I). Following this, the thesis explores the asymmetry as between the addressees of the two sets of provisions (Chapter II). It is argued that ‘undertaking with a dominant position’, as a distinct condition of the application of Article 102 TFEU, is the outer limit to any expansive view of direct horizontal applicability of the freedoms. Therefore, alleged market separation by dominant undertakings should be subject to Article 102 TFEU alone. Subsequently, the material scope of the prohibitions contained in the two sets of provisions is addressed. Here, it is argued that, {{in the vast majority of}} market separation cases, there is nothing special about {{the interface between}} competition law and the Internal Market. Rather, the inherent limits of economic integration, as reflected in the notion of trade barriers, should also be taken into account under the enforcement of Article 102 TFEU against dominant undertakings (Chapter III). Tensions between competition law and the Internal Market may, nevertheless, arise when non-economic values, as reflected in the notion of justified trade barriers, come into play. In these cases, the interface between competition law and the Internal Market is better conceptualised as a question of unclear attribution of the market distorting effect to the undertaking and/or the State (Chapter IV). A revised defence of shared responsibility for the market separation is proposed, which would render the legality of State intervention under the free movement provisions a necessary condition for the application of Article 102 TFEU against the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> (Chapters V and VI).

40|$|When a <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> {{holding a}} standard-essential patent uses its {{exclusive}} {{right to the}} IP to seek injunctions against those wishing to produce either de jure or de facto standard compliant products, it creates a conflict between the exclusive right {{to the use of}} the IP on the one hand and the possible abuse of dominance due to the exclusionary conduct on the other. The aim of the thesis is to focus on the issues concerning abuse of dominance in violation of Article 102 TFEU when the holder of the standard-essential patent seeks an injunction against a would-be licensee. The thesis is mainly based on the most recent ECJ case law in Huawei and the Commission’s recent decisions in Samsung and Motorola. The case law in Europe prior to those decisions was mainly focused on the German case law from Orange Book Standard which provided IP holders great leverage due to the almost automatic granting of injunctions against infringers. The ECJ in Huawei set out the requirements for when a de jure standard-essential patent holder would not be violating Article 102 TFEU when seeking an injunction, requiring that negotiations in good faith must take place prior to the seeking of the injunction and that all offers must comply with FRAND terms, thus limiting the scope of case law derived from Orange Book Standard in Germany. The ECJ chose not to follow all of the reasoning the Commission had laid out in Samsung and Motorola which provided a more licensee-friendly approach on the matter, but rather chose a compromise between the IP holder friendly German case law and the Commission’s decisions. However, the ECJ did not disclose how FRAND terms themselves should be interpreted, but rather left it for the national courts to decide. Furthermore, the thesis strongly argues that Huawei did not change the fact that only vertically integrated IP holders who have made a FRAND declaration are subject to the terms laid out in Huawei, thus leaving non-practicing entities such as patent trolls and entities that have not made a FRAND declaration outside its scope. The resulting conclusion from the thesis is that while the ECJ in Huawei presented new exceptional circumstances for when an IP holder could be abusing its dominant position when it seeks an injunction, it still left many more questions answered, such as the meaning of FRAND and whether deception in giving a FRAND declaration is prohibited under Article 102 TFEU or not...|$|E
40|$|As is {{very well}} known, {{intellectual}} property rights throughout the world have recently experienced a massive expansionist trend. Patent law has slowly stretched the boundaries of patentable subject matter to cover DNA sequences, software and business methods, leaving commentators to wonder whether it still make sense to inquire about what can and cannot be patented in the first place. Similarly, copyright law has been expanding in all possible directions: not just new subject matters have been added and new set of rights created, but the length of protection has been extended, and even {{a new set of}} exclusive rights has been created to protect technological measures that, in turn, are meant to protect copyrighted works. Such trends have been strongly backed by a reverse tendency in the application of antitrust laws towards anticompetitive practices involving intangible monopolies. After a period of hostility when antitrust laws, both in U. S. and E. U., severely constrained IP-owners’ licensing practices and unilateral behaviors, the wind changed again toward a more pro-IP attitude. This new approach has {{played a central role in}} strengthening IP-owners’ exclusive rights by allowing them to obtain a far greater monopoly than the one they were entitled to. Despite the major commonalities of approaches taken by United States and Europe, it is important to point out that some discrepancies have occurred with regard to the way the two systems have assessed anticompetitive behaviors endorsed by dominant firms whose position of strength stems, in great part, from intellectual property rights. Indeed, as I will show in this study, American antitrust treatment of refusal to deal cases has created a de facto immunity from antitrust intervention for unilateral conduct of <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> holding intellectual assets. Conversely, European antitrust law has endorsed a more restrictive attitude, holding that when exceptional circumstances do exist, the exclusive faculty of the IP-owner can be curtailed in favor of a more competitive structure of the market. As I will explain, the reasons for these discrepancies can be also traced back to more general differences of American and European assessment of anticompetitive unilateral conduct. This study is divided into three sections. The first section will be devoted to a comparative study of American and European antitrust provisions dealing with unilateral exclusionary conduct. Here it will be explained that although section 2 of the Sherman Act and Article 82 of the EC Treaty seem to share several commonalities, many significant differences do exist regarding both the normative framework and the practical assessment of the cases. The second part will be specifically concerned with the analysis of American and European cases involving the intersection between intellectual property rights and antitrust law. The third and last part will comment on the economic significance of intellectual property rights, and thus on the proper weight they should be afforded in an antitrust analysis...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 An {{investigation}} of the correlation between a number of behavioral, morphological and physiological parameters and dominance status of male Ring-necked Pheasants (Phasianus colchicus) was <b>undertaken.</b> <b>Dominant</b> males performed significantly more aggressive behaviors than subordinates and {{a higher proportion of}} these behaviors was directed toward distantly ranked subordinates. Animals could also be ranked in a subordinance hierarchy with subordinate males performing submissive behaviors and vocalizations at highest frequencies and directing the largest proportion of these behaviors toward distantly ranked dominants. A number of morphological characters were measured and their correlations with dominance status were investigated. Several significant correlations between certain body and wattle measurements were found. Experimental manipulations of the wattles were conducted to attempt to change behaviors and dominance status. Wattles of dominant birds were painted black to make them look subordinate. Wattles of subordinate birds were painted red to make them look dominant. Two of the dominant birds received more aggressive behaviors from true subordinates, after their wattles were painted. Two of the subordinate birds received fewer aggressive behaviors from true dominants, after their wattles were painted. Plasma levels of testicular hormones were measured during hierarchy establishment and in stable hierarchies. No correlations were found between testosterone levels and dominance status or frequencies of any of the agonistic behaviors measured. Exogenous hormones (estradiol, dihydrotestosterone, corticosterone, ACTH₄₋₁₀ and α-MSH) were injected to attempt to alter behaviors and change dominance status. These attempts were unsuccessful. My data conform to previously published reports on the use of morphological characters as signals of dominance status. My data also corroborate the absence of correlations of testicular hormone levels with dominance status and behavioral frequencies in other species of birds. The advantages of a status signalling system are discussed and reasons for living in a group and remaining subordinate are examined...|$|R
40|$|The study {{analyses}} {{the widening}} scope of competition {{law in the}} area of intellectual property rights law and the risk factors of compulsory licensing remedy for the intellectual property rights owners at European Union market. The subject of current thesis is interesting as despite the great amount of legal literature discussing the topic it still remains a controversial and developing area of European Union competition law. Intellectual property owner operating in Europe should take advantage of knowledge of the Court of Justice of the European Union case law on compulsory licensing cases to protect its commercial interests and assess the risks of European Commission and Member States court’s to be convinced that a compulsory license is the appropriate remedy if parties will not reach the agreement on licensing through their own negotiations. The refusal to license has been considered to be an abuse of a dominant position regulated under the Article 102 of the Treaty of the Functioning the European. The EU authorities have developed a list of “exceptional circumstances” for finding a refusal to license as an abuse under the Article 102 through their decisions. The Court of Justice of the European Union develops EU law by applying dynamic interpretation, thus the primary source for addressing the research topic is the case law of the Court of Justice of the European Union. The scope of this work is limited to the analysis of the most noteworthy cases in EU jurisprudence concerning the Article 102 of the TFEU and refusal to license. In some situations when IP law fails to guarantee the level of innovation in the market the competition law’s intervention may be justified as it happened e. g. in factual situation of case Magill. The landmark decision by Court of Justice is IMS Health, setting forth the legal standard applicable in the European Union today. However, European policy will be also assessed {{in the light of the}} recent European Commission decisions and General Court case law. The most recent compulsory licensing case Microsoft will be examined to analyse the policy developments and examine what test might be applied under European competition law in the future cases. In this research paper it will be examined if the competition law in Europe has graduated towards a more economic effect based approach and how the relationship between intellectual property and competition law may be seen as complementary and not as antagonistic. The different characteristics of intellectual property rights rather than “normal” property rights will be discussed according to the development of case law and analysis conducted to see what is the rationale of the new product criterion of the exceptional circumstances test. When considering the effectiveness of the jurisprudence it is necessary to take into account the need to balance the effective competition on the market and the encouragement for further innovation. The intellectual property rights protection has an important role in promoting the technological development and thus also in providing more choice for the consumers. The exceptional circumstances test created by the Court of Justice is formalistic and does not take fully into consideration the situation where intellectual property rights owner may block the innovation, however, it must be stressed that the courts are not generally well equipped to conduct the effect-based cost-benefit analysis that is necessary in order to balance the incentives of the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking</b> and its competitors to innovate, and such evaluation may prove to be a difficult task for the judiciary. The standards developed in case law are fact-specific and ultimately a source of uncertainty for undertakings at EU market. The study gathers together the most significant snapshots of law and assesses the possibilities where the EU jurisprudence on compulsory licensing is heading. The author concludes that the law on compulsory licensing in Europe will continue to evolve towards lesser intellectual protection to advance competition, innovation and free movement of goods, however, in spite of the widening scope of the European competition law the conditions for issuing compulsory licenses are still highly restrictive...|$|E
40|$|Competition law is an {{important}} area of Community law. It influences {{a lot of the}} everyday business of companies all over the world. The two most important regulations are Article 81 and 82 of the EC Treaty. These are the base for the competition authorities and also for the institutions within the Community when it comes to issuing different types of regulations. Article 81 is addressed to companies and regulates the situations when two undertakings enter into agreements. If these agreements fulfill the criteria in the article they are considered to be in conflict with European Competition Law, and shall therefore be considered void. The 3 rd paragraph of Article 81 does however contain exemptions that can make it possible for the companies to uphold their agreement even if it fulfills {{the first part of the}} article. Article 82 regulates the situation when one or more dominant undertakings act on the market. An undertaking is not prevented from holding a dominant position on the market but when there is an abuse of this position competition rules are there to regulate this conduct. There is a clear connection between Article 81 and 82. They can be applied to the same agreement and the application of Article 81 (3) does not prevent the application of Article 82. It has been made clear that Article 81 (3) cannot be applied to permit an abuse of a dominant position. Licensing is an area that is growing rapidly and that is becoming more and more important on the market. This area is under great influence from competition rules and there are several different Community regulations that has to be considered. One of the most important ones is the Technology Transfer Block Exemption Regulation. This regulation has undergone changes lately and a new block exemption was adopted last year. Some major changes were made, mainly so that the regulation now has an economic and effect-based approach instead of the old legalistic and form-based approach. One of the changes important for this thesis is that software now is included in the TTBER. This means that licensing of software will have a new regulation to take into account when conducting business. Critique has been heard that the new TTBER is not adapted for software licensing and that this will create problems. Since the TTBER is not even a year old yet it is hard to say if there are any big difficulties for the software industry. In relation software licensing it is important to consider the Council Directive on the legal protection of computer programs. Interoperability is regulated by this directive and that is important when it comes to software and software licensing. It is often in relation to Article 82 EC that these kind of questions arise since it can be an abuse of dominant position to prevent competitors from being able to create programs that interact with these of the <b>dominant</b> <b>undertaking.</b> There has been some interesting decisions from the Commission and judgments from the European Court of Justice on this matter. The most recent one that has gotten a lot of media attention is the Microsoft decision where Microsoft was obliged to release interface information to competitors so that interoperability was achievable. As will be seen in this thesis, there are several things that has to be considered when it comes to licensing in the European Community. As mentioned, the TTBER is one of the most important regulations to keep in mind and it can give a lot of companies guidance when it comes to concluding agreements. If the companies fall below the market share threshold set out in the TTBER many clauses in the agreements will be permitted even if they would not have been if the companies would have had bigger market shares. The market shares is one of the big difficulties in the TTBER since the assessment can be very hard to do. Depending on the definition of relevant product and technology markets the market shares can differ. The rules in the TTBER are somewhat different depending on if the actors are competitors or not and that will make the regulation even more complicated. The TTBER is an regulation that is complicated and it might require some knowledge to apply it. The Commission has issued guidelines to help with this and these guidelines are almost as important as the regulation itself. The two documents, the regulation and the guidelines shall be read together and seen more as a whole than two separate things...|$|E
