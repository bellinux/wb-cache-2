50|$|Dividend futures allow {{investors to}} take a {{position}} on the future dividends paid by single names or indices such as the Euro Stoxx 50. An investor might believe that a company's future dividend payment expectations are too high or too low and can decide {{to take a}} position in dividend futures to express his views. By investing in a single stock <b>dividend</b> <b>future,</b> an investor has a proxy of a company's earnings. dividends paid by a company usually varying in line with its earnings, the investor can take a pure fundamental view by choosing which dividend, hence which earnings forecast, he wants to pinpoint. Because <b>dividend</b> <b>future</b> are finite, at one stage, the performance of the future will be driven only by the company's paid dividends rather than micro or macro economic news flow.By investing in an Index <b>dividend</b> <b>future,</b> investors have a similar exposure, except they're taking a view on a basket of companies. This is usually done to implement a macro view on future dividends in a country or a continent.|$|E
5000|$|In finance, a <b>dividend</b> <b>future</b> is an {{exchange-traded}} derivative contract that allows investors to take positions on future dividend payments. Dividend futures {{can be on}} a single company, a basket of companies, or on an Equity index. [...] They settle {{on the amount of}} dividend paid by the company, the basket of companies, or the index during the period of the contract.|$|E
5000|$|For example, if company A pays a {{quarterly}} dividend of $0.25 in 2012. If an investor buys a 2012 <b>dividend</b> <b>future,</b> the settlement {{price of the}} future will be equal to 4 x $0.25 = $1 per contract. The profit or loss the investor makes depends on the difference between the price they bought or sold the future and the settlement price. For instance, if the investor bought the 2012 <b>dividend</b> <b>future</b> at $0,90, he would make a profit of $0.10 per contract.Most dividend futures trades occur before the dividend is known, hence allowing investors to go [...] "long" [...] or [...] "short" [...] the future dividend payment. The [...] "buyer" [...] of the contract, is said to be [...] "long", and the [...] "seller" [...] of the contract, is said to be [...] "short". The terminology reflects the expectations of the parties: the buyer thinks the dividend is going to increase, while the seller thinks it will decrease. The contract itself costs nothing to enter; the buy/sell terminology is a linguistic convenience reflecting the position each party is taking (long or short).|$|E
50|$|From a hedging instrument, <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> {{have the}} {{potential}} of developing as an asset class on their own. From an investor perspective, <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> give exposure to a specific cash flow stream from a company. Unlike equities, where an investor is exposed to continuing <b>dividend</b> stream, <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> allow investors to choose the year {{they want to get}} exposed on.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dividend</b> <b>futures</b> {{can be used}} {{by investors}} for investment, hedging or arbitrage.|$|R
50|$|There are {{currently}} <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> listed on Eurex, NYSE Euronext, MEFF, Borsa Italiana IDEM, London Stock Exchange, Tokyo Stock Exchange, Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited, CME Group and the Singapore Exchange.|$|R
50|$|Most equity {{derivatives}} instruments, like options, {{are sensitive}} to future evolution of dividends. In the past, the <b>dividend</b> <b>future</b> market players were pure derivatives players {{because they were the}} most sensitive to dividend outcomes. They use these futures, and before them dividend Swaps, to hedge their dividend exposure.dividend futures are also seen as an inflation hedge. Studies show that dividend and inflation growth are correlated, hence the use of long term dividend futures, like on indices, to hedge an investor's exposure to inflation.|$|E
50|$|Like on any asset class, {{investors can}} take a {{relative}} value position on a market compared to another. In dividend futures, the arbitrage opportunities can be taken against its underlying stock or CDS. Going long a <b>dividend</b> <b>future,</b> for example, and short the underlying stock results in taking a position on a company's dividend yield.Another type of arbitrage, that is common with equities, is called Index Arbitrage. In dividend futures, Index Arbitrage consists of taking spread positions between an Index dividend futures and its components.|$|E
5000|$|Before {{dividend}} futures existed, {{an investor}} {{who wanted a}} similar exposure did so by trading a dividend swap. Dividend swaps are the over-the-counter version of dividend futures. They allow two parties to agree to swap in the future a pre-defined amount of cash against the amount of dividends paid by the underlying stock, basket or equity index.Created in the early 2000s, dividend Swaps became very popular because they allowed equity holders to [...] "sell" [...] their future dividends in advance and hence hedge their future dividend stream. The biggest players were investment banks looking to cover their future dividend exposure from derivatives positions they had on their books.The first <b>dividend</b> <b>future</b> was listed in June 2008 by the derivatives exchange Eurex, a derivatives exchange, on the Euro Stoxx 50 dividends, and since then many new dividend futures were created on various exchanges.|$|E
50|$|Historical {{players in}} this market were banks who offset the {{dividend}} risks from their structured products to their clients, mainly hedge funds, through dividend Swaps.Year 2008 saw {{the arrival of the}} first <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> and the collapse of the financial industry, hence market participants in dividend Swaps switched their position to <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> to eliminate counterparty risks. The listing also brought new players,who were not active in the Over-The-Counter market, such as asset managers, pension funds and family offices.The market not being anymore reserved to some few specialists, volumes picked up and number of participants grew.|$|R
50|$|<b>Dividend</b> <b>futures</b> {{are usually}} traded in increments/lots/batches of 100 or 1000 {{and have a}} 1-year time span. When purchased, no {{transmission}} of share rights or <b>dividends</b> occurs. Being <b>futures</b> contracts, they are traded on margin, thus offering leverage, and {{are not subject to}} the taxes equity holders must pay when they receive dividend distribution on their stocks. They are traded in various financial markets, mainly in Europe, and Asia, and several Blue chip companies and Equity Indices are available with maturities going as long as 5 years for Equities and 10 years for Equity indices.|$|R
40|$|A widely {{replicated}} result, using U. S. data, is that dividend-price ratios predict future returns, not <b>future</b> <b>dividend</b> growth. This {{is evidence}} of stock-return predictability, and {{is contrary to the}} original interpretation of the efficient-market hypothesis. The author argues that this pre-dictability may be an artifact of the American economy’s remarkably stable real growth. This article examines the relation between <b>dividend</b> yields, <b>future</b> returns, and <b>dividend</b> growth, using current international data. It concludes that, in some countries, dividend-price ratios predict future returns; in other countries, they predict <b>future</b> <b>dividend</b> growth; and in still other countries, they predict a combination of the two.

40|$|Preliminary and {{incomplete}} We use a new data set on <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> with maturities up to 10 years to uncover expected dividend growth rates across three major regions around the world: the US, Europe, and Japan. We use these futures to derive equity yields, analogous to bond yields, and decompose these yields into expected {{growth rates of}} dividends and a risk premium component. We find that both risk premia as well as expected growth rates exhibit substantial variation over time.

40|$|We study a {{new data}} set of <b>dividend</b> <b>futures</b> with {{maturities}} {{up to ten}} years across three world regions: the US, Europe, and Japan. We use these asset prices to construct equity yields, analogous to bond yields. We decompose the equity yields to obtain a term structure of expected dividend growth rates and a term structure of risk premia, which decomposes the equity risk premium by maturity. We find that {{the slope of the}} term structure of risk premia is pro-cyclical, whereas the slope of the term structure of expected dividend growth rates is counter-cyclical. The comovement of yields across regions is, on average, higher for long-maturity yields than for short-maturity yields, whereas the variation in this comovement is much higher for short-maturity yield...|$|R
40|$|Many {{argue that}} <b>dividends</b> signal <b>future</b> {{earnings}} or dispose of excess cash. Empirical support is inconclusive, potentially because no model combines both rationales. This paper does. Higher quality firms pay dividends {{to eliminate the}} free cash-flow problem, while firms that outsiders perceive as lower quality pay <b>dividends</b> to signal <b>future</b> earnings and reduce the free cash-flow problem. In equilibrium, dividends are nonmonotonic {{with respect to the}} signal observed by outsiders; the highest quality firms pay smaller dividends than lower perceived quality firms. The model reconciles the existing literature and generates new empirical predictions that are tested and supported. Copyright (c) 2010, The Eastern Finance Association. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper extends US {{evidence}} {{on the ability of}} current dividend yields to predict future equity returns in the G 5 countries. By using non-parametric methods, evidence of a similar non- linear structure is found in all the countries analysed. This casts doubt on the linear framework adopted in earlier studies. The paper also finds that there is a strong relationship between extremes of <b>dividends</b> and <b>future</b> returns (in that very low/high dividends do predict low/high returns whilst intermediate levels of dividends do not). This non-linear structure strengthens the statistical evidence of a relationship between <b>dividend</b> yields and <b>future</b> returns and may help explain why previous studies have found mixed evidence. ...|$|R

50|$|Coming up {{with the}} {{dividend}} policy is challenging for the directors and financial manager of a company, because different investors have different views on present cash <b>dividends</b> and <b>future</b> capital gains.

Hence, fundamental values are better reflected in market prices - implying higher market efficiency - when some traders know more than others about the future prospects of an asset.

40|$|This paper {{summarizes}} {{earlier research}} On {{the sources of}} variation in monthly U. S. stock returns in the period 1927 - 88. A log-linear model is used to break unexpected returns into changing expectations about <b>future</b> <b>dividends</b> and changing expectations about future returns.

Changing expected returns have a large effect on the stock market because their movements are persistent and negatively correlated with changing expected dividends. ...|$|R

50|$|Another {{example is}} the {{constant}} growth Dividend Discount Model for the valuation of the common stock of a corporation, which assumes that the market price per share {{is equal to the}} discounted stream of all <b>future</b> <b>dividends,</b> which is assumed to be perpetual.

40|$|Abstract. This paper studies a {{model of}} {{corporate}} finance in which firms use stock issuance to finance investment. We assume that the firm is "rational " and therefore recognizes the relationship between <b>future</b> <b>dividends</b> and stock prices. Under this assumption, future variables enter in {{the constraints of the}} firm, so that the problem is not recursive in a standard sense and the Bellman equation does not hold. This implies that the model has to be solved with recursive contracts methods such as the ones used, for example, in models of optimal macroeconomic policy or in risk sharing models with participation constraints. In addition, financial policy may be time inconsistent. First, we characterize several cases where time consistency arises. Second, we compare numerically the full commitment (and potentially time inconsistent) solution of a "rational " firm to the one of a "naive " firm that ignores the relationship between current price and <b>future</b> <b>dividends.</b> Our results suggest that growing firms will pay lower dividends at the beginning and promise higher <b>dividends</b> in the <b>future.</b> This allows them to raise cheaper external funds through a higher value of stocks, accumulate more capital, and grow faster...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} and empirically tests {{a dynamic}} model of dividend smoothing and signaling. Intertemporal dividend smoothing {{results from a}} “signal jamming ” problem whereby the manager uses dividends not only to convey information about future cash flows but also to influence perceptions of his abilities. Any excess cash left after the dividend is paid must be carried into the future at a dissipative cost, and any cash shortfall arising from promising too high a dividend must be borrowed at a cost. Since these costs are higher for low-ability managers, high-ability managers promise a lower <b>dividend</b> when <b>future</b> cash flows are high and a higher <b>dividend</b> when <b>future</b> cash flows are low. Thus, high-ability managers not only credibly signal their type and the firm’s future cash flows, but also smooth dividends more than low-ability managers. Consistent with the model, I find that firms that smooth more have higher future values, larger price appreciations to unexpected dividend increases, and smaller price declines to unexpected dividend decreases. Further, I find that high-ability managers smooth dividends more than low-ability managers. Lintner (1956) first proposed that firms smooth changes in their dividends relative to changes i...|$|R
