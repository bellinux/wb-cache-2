5|$|Although McCain {{was seriously}} wounded and injured, his captors refused to treat him. They beat and interrogated {{him to get}} information, and he was given medical care only when the North Vietnamese {{discovered}} {{that his father was}} a high-ranking admiral.

5|$|Due to Turkish {{government}} {{fears of}} a terrorist attack, security measures during the summit were tight. Demonstrators {{from around the world}} gathered to protest against NATO or the American foreign policy under the George W.

5|$|In his 1998 {{autobiography}} For the Love of the Game, Jordan {{wrote that}} he had been preparing for retirement as early as the summer of 1992.

5|$|Altgens recovered, and {{his next}} {{photograph}} showed the First Lady {{with her hand}} on the vehicle's trunk lid and Secret Service agent Clint Hill standing on the bumper behind her as the driver had begun to accelerate. This photograph was quickly reproduced on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> newspapers around the world. Mrs. Kennedy testified the following June that she was aware of the image, but had no memory of her actions. Hill later wrote that this picture would forever identify him as the Secret Service agent {{on the back of the}} limousine.|$|E
5|$|Altgens was on {{assignment}} for the AP when he captured two historic images on November 22, 1963.

5|$|Although other retired {{high-ranking}} officers, including generals James Gavin and Matthew Ridgway, joined Shoup in this, it was Shoup's pointed criticisms {{that regularly}} made the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> newspapers, because they {{went beyond the}} war to American government, business, and military leadership. He feared the conflict had endangered the nation's historical identity, and argued increasing the troop levels in Vietnam would only aggravate the strategic problems there. Historian Robert Buzzanco noted that Shoup {{may have been the}} most vocal former military member to oppose the war.|$|E
5|$|The NBC radio crew {{aboard the}} lead bomber made its live {{broadcast}} coast-to-coast as the bombers flew by the Rex. The Army's low-altitude photographs were featured {{the next day}} on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> hundreds of newspapers. Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in the United States, also planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E

25|$|Kilgallen was {{publicly}} {{skeptical of}} the conclusions of the Warren Commission's report into the assassination of President Kennedy and wrote several newspaper articles on the subject. She obtained a copy of Jack Ruby's testimony to the Warren Commission, which she published in August 1964 on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the Journal American, the Philadelphia Inquirer, the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, and other newspapers. Most of that testimony did not become officially {{available to the public}} until the commission released its 26 volumes of hearings and exhibits in November 1964, {{around the time of the}} first anniversary of the assassination.|$|E
25|$|Dealing {{with the}} Prize, Bunin donated 100,000 francs to a {{literary}} charity fund, {{but the process}} of money distribution caused controversy among his fellow Russian émigré writers. It was during this time that Bunin's relationship deteriorated with Zinaida Gippius and Dmitry Merezhkovsky (a fellow Nobel Prize nominee who once suggested that they divide the Prize between the two, should one of them get it, and had been refused). Although reluctant {{to become involved in}} politics, Bunin was now feted as both a writer and the embodiment of non-Bolshevik Russian values and traditions. His travels throughout Europe featured prominently on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> the Russian emigre press {{for the remainder of the}} decade.|$|E
25|$|During the Iraq War, Staff Sergeant Popaditch was {{assigned}} as a tank commander and platoon sergeant. Participating in the 2003 invasion of Iraq, his unit gained fame when it helped topple {{the statue of}} Saddam Hussein in Firdos Square on April 9, 2003. Associated Press photographer Laurent Rebours photographed Popaditch in his tank’s cupola, smoking a cigar with the statue of Saddam looming in the background. The image, which earned him the nickname “The Cigar Marine,” appeared on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> newspapers {{around the world to}} describe the Battle of Baghdad. He would later reveal that his smoking was a celebration of his and his wife's twelfth wedding anniversary as well as victory. Following his return to the United States, he was promoted to gunnery sergeant and volunteered to return to Iraq in 2004.|$|E

25|$|The Antonescus were ktitors {{of three}} Romanian Orthodox churches in {{separate}} Bucharest areas: Mărgeanului Church in Rahova, one in Dămăroaia, and the Saints Constantine and Helena Church in Muncii, {{where they are}} depicted in a mural. In 1941, after floods took a toll on Argeș County, the two founded Antonești, a model village in Corbeni (partly built by Ukrainian prisoners of war, and later passed into state property). Although her picture was a regular presence on the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> newspapers and magazines, Maria Antonescu was nevertheless perceived by some of her contemporaries as a withdrawn and secondary figure. Accounts of her life were provided by various public figures, including Princess Ileana (who met her shortly before leaving the country in 1947) and anti-communist members of the Romanian diaspora. Some mentions of her were made in Bénie sois-tu, prison ("Bless You, Prison"), a best-selling book of memoirs by Nicole Valéry Grossu, a former Mislea inmate and defector to France.|$|E
25|$|On 5 September 2006, Huntley {{was found}} {{unconscious}} in his prison cell and {{thought to have}} taken an overdose. He had previously taken an overdose of antidepressants in prison in June 2003 while awaiting his trial. He was under police guard in hospital for two days, before being returned to Wakefield prison, prompting much reaction from many present at the scene, as well as making the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> many of the UK newspapers the next morning. Following this attempted suicide, his cell was cleared and a tape was found which was marked with Queen {{on one side and}} Meat Loaf on the other. This tape is thought to contain confessions from Huntley on what he did and how he did it. It is believed that Huntley made the tape in return for antidepressants from a fellow prisoner, who hoped to obtain and later sell the confession to the media after his release. On 28 March 2007, The Sun began publishing transcripts of Huntley's taped confession.|$|E
25|$|Julie Foudy, Kristine Lilly, and the 1999 team {{started a}} {{revolution}} towards women's team sports in America. Arguably their most influential and memorable victory {{came in the}} 1999 World Cup when they defeated China 5–4 in a penalty shoot-out following a 0–0 draw after extended time. With this win they emerged onto the world stage and brought significant media attention to women's soccer and athletics. On July 10, 1999, over 90,000 people (the largest ever for a women's sporting event {{and one of the}} largest attendances in the world for a tournament game final) filled the Rose Bowl to watch the United States play China in the Final. After a back and forth game, the score was tied 0–0 at full-time, and remained so after extra time, leading to a penalty kick shootout. With Briana Scurry's save of China's third kick, the score was 4–4 with only Brandi Chastain left to shoot. She scored and won the game for the United States. Chastain famously dropped to her knees and whipped off her shirt, celebrating in her sports bra, which later made the cover of Sports Illustrated and the <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> newspapers around the country and world. This win influenced girls to want to play soccer on a team.|$|E
