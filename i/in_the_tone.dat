5|$|One day I chanced {{to see a}} {{performance}} of the Bunraku puppet theater and was very surprised by it. It was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> quality, the timbre, of the futazao shamisen, the wide-necked shamisen used in Bunraku, that I first recognized the splendor of traditional Japanese music. I was very moved by it and I wondered why my attention had never been captured before by this Japanese music.|$|E

Trevor also increased the usage of more millennial based references, impersonations & characterisations for his comedy on the show, due to his younger demographic and his ability to speak in multiple accents and eight languages.|$|E

5|$|Le Guin was {{strongly}} opposed to and {{troubled by the}} Vietnam War, a reaction which played a large part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of the novel. The tone {{of the novel is}} often harsh and hard-hitting, playing off the anger in the United States at American military actions in Vietnam. The tension between violence and non-violence {{is a part of the}} dialectic theme in the novel, of a constant tension between opposites. Through most of the novel, the Terran military is in control of the colony, despite Raj Lyubov's good intentions. Davidson is the most prominent example of the oppressiveness of the military government. There are intentional parallels drawn between the Terran colonizers and the US intervention in Vietnam; the anti-interventionist tone of the novel was in sharp contrast to other science-fiction novels about war written around the same period. For example, the high use of drugs amongst US troops in Vietnam is represented by the use of hallucinogens amongst the Terran soldiers, which Le Guin portrays as the norm on the colony.|$|E

50|$|Both Gwoyeu Romatzyh and Simplified Wade use tonal spelling, but in {{two very}} {{different}} fashions. <b>In</b> Gwoyeu Romatzyh, <b>the</b> spelling of <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> and <b>the</b> spelling of the final often fuse together: WG -iao has the basic spelling -iau in GR, which becomes -yau <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2nd <b>tone,</b> -eau <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3rd <b>tone,</b> -iaw <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 4th <b>tone,</b> and remains -iau <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1st <b>tone</b> - hence WG chiao1, chiao2, chiao3, chiao4 become GR jiau, jyau, jeau, jiaw. There are different rules for different cases: WG p&#x2bb;in1, p&#x2bb;in2, p&#x2bb;in3, p&#x2bb;in4 become GR pin, pyn, piin, pinn, but WG sui1, sui2, sui3, sui4 become GR suei, swei, soei, suey.|$|R

25|$|At Compline (whether Small or Great) a Canon to the Theotokos <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Tone</b> of the Week will {{normally}} be read (these Canons {{will be found}} in the Octoechos). Services to saints in the Menaion that for various reasons cannot be celebrated on the day assigned to them, may be chanted on the nearest convenient day at Compline. In such cases, the Canon for the Saint would be read together with the Canon to the Theotokos, followed by the Stichera to the saint from Vespers. There are also particular days (such as certain Forefeasts, Afterfeasts, and days during the Pentecostarion) that have special Canons for Compline composed for them.|$|E
25|$|When the Daughters of Bilitis or the Mattachine Society had a convention, {{the news}} was reported. The {{magazine}} compiled {{some of the first}} statistics about lesbians in the United States by sending their readership questionnaires, the first in 1957 and again in 1963. There was a marked difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of the magazine after Barbara Gittings heard Frank Kameny speak at the national DOB convention that attempting to find the cause of homosexuality {{was a waste of time}} since it was equal to heterosexuality. Many articles from 1956 to 1963 focused on ways to function in an overwhelmingly homophobic world, but gradually articles began to appear that were unapologetic in promoting lesbianism.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} of its {{publication}} in July 1791, the book had been printed in four variants, differing only in front matter. In the first two variants, 1790 is given as the year of publication, and in the other two variants it is 1791. The 1790 variants have two title pages, one in Slavonic-Serbian (folio 1 verso), and the other in German (folio 2 recto). The earlier of these variants contains a dedication to Metropolitan Mojsije Putnik composed by Kurzbeck, while the other variant has no dedication. The 1791 variants have one title page (folio 2 recto) with both the Slavonic-Serbian and the German version of the title. The preceding page (folio 1 verso) contains a copperplate engraving depicting Count Francis Balassa, and these two variants differ only in some details of the engraving. After the title page comes a dedication to Balassa, composed by Kurzbeck <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of humble devotion. All variants have the same foreword written by Kurzbeck, while none of them mentions Jacob Rodde as the source or Teodor Avramović as the editor of the dictionary. Only Kurzbeck is mentioned as its publisher. Its source and editor have been identified respectively by Samuel Linde {{at the beginning of the}} 19th century and Pavel Jozef Šafárik in 1865, since when the book has been referred to as the Avramović Dictionary.|$|E
25|$|Once Henry had {{withdrawn}} with {{the bulk of}} the imperial army the towns that had supposedly fallen to the Empire immediately declared their allegiance to Tancred, for the most part now fearing his retribution. Nicholas of Ajello, son of Matthew and former Archbishop of Salerno, who was helping defend Naples, wrote letters about the events to his friends in Salerno. Thus the populace of Salerno saw an opportunity to win some favour with Tancred, so they besieged the defenseless Constance at Castel Terracena. Constance presented herself on a balcony and spoke to them <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>tone</b> of mild remonstrance and admonition, trying to tell them that the situation might improve and the defeat of Henry might be exaggerated by Nicholas, but the Salernitans were determined to capture her for Tancred, so they continued the siege. Constance locked herself in her room, locked the windows, and prayed to God for help and revenge. After a rapid negotiation with Elia di Gesualdo, a distant relative of Tancred, Constance voluntarily went out under the condition that her German garrison were to be allowed to leave unharmed. She was then arrested by Elia (and some barons of Apulia who were related to her) and delivered to Tancred in Messina by Admiral Margaritus of Brindisi (her brother-in-law who had helped in the defence of Naples), on a bireme galley or dromon with 200 rowers. She was in her attire as empress, wearing a dress quilted with gold and decorated with roses, a cloak covered with precious jewels, and her hair was strewn with gems, making her look like a goddess. Thus she became an important and valuable prize given that Henry had every intention of returning. When meeting Constance Tancred blamed her for the invasion, but she proudly responded that she was just taking back her dominion robbed by Tancred.|$|E
