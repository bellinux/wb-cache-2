5|$|Desalination is the {{technique}} of removing salts from seawater to leave fresh water suitable for <b>drinking</b> <b>or</b> irrigation. The two main processing methods, vacuum distillation and reverse osmosis, use large quantities of energy. Desalination is normally only undertaken where fresh water from other sources is in short supply or energy is plentiful, as in the excess heat generated by power stations. The brine produced as a by-product contains some toxic materials and is returned to the sea.|$|E
5|$|Ambulocetus natans, which lived about 49 {{million years}} ago, was {{discovered}} in Pakistan in 1994. It was probably amphibious, and looked like a crocodile. In the Eocene, ambulocetids inhabited the bays and estuaries of the Tethys Ocean in northern Pakistan. The fossils of ambulocetids are always found in near-shore shallow marine deposits associated with abundant marine plant fossils and littoral molluscs. Although they are found only in marine deposits, their oxygen isotope values indicate that they consumed water {{with a range of}} degrees of salinity, some specimens showing no evidence of sea water consumption and others none of fresh water consumption at the time when their teeth were fossilized. It is clear that ambulocetids tolerated a wide range of salt concentrations. Their diet probably included land animals that approached water for <b>drinking,</b> <b>or</b> freshwater aquatic organisms that lived in the river. Hence, ambulocetids represent the transition phase of cetacean ancestors between freshwater and marine habitat.|$|E
5|$|Each {{city and}} county in the Metro service area has similar {{ordinances}} that regulate or prohibit vending on Metro-owned property, and which prohibit riders from eating, <b>drinking,</b> <b>or</b> smoking in Metro trains, buses, and stations; the Transit Police {{have a reputation for}} enforcing these laws rigorously. One widely publicized incident occurred in October 2000 when police arrested 12-year-old Ansche Hedgepeth for eating french fries in the Tenleytown-AU station. In a 2004 opinion by John Roberts, now Chief Justice of the United States, the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Hedgepeth's arrest. By then WMATA had answered negative publicity by adopting a policy of first issuing warnings to juveniles, and arresting them only after three violations within a year.|$|E

5|$|In January 1971, with Bobby Moore, Brian Dear and Clyde Best, Greaves was {{involved}} in late-night drinking, against the wishes of manager Ron Greenwood, prior to an FA Cup tie away to Blackpool. On arriving in Blackpool, Greaves and his teammates had been informed {{by members of the}} press that the game, the following day, was unlikely to go ahead due to a frozen pitch and the likelihood of frost that night. Believing {{that there would be no}} game the following day, Greaves drank 12 lagers in a club owned by Brian London and did not return to the team hotel until 1.45am. In fact, the match went ahead and West Ham lost 4–0. Greaves claimed the defeat was not a result of the late night, the <b>drinking</b> <b>or</b> the frozen pitch, but because the West Ham team in which he was playing was not good enough. As a result, the players were fined and dropped by the club.|$|E
