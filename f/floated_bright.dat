Materials used include: Alabama limestone, glazing, granite, copper, bronze, Carrara marble, carpet, cherry plywood panels and Brazilian Rosewood. The Sony Centre is very diverse with its range of materials and employs them {{in such a way that}} they are not overshadowed by the unique forms of the building. The interior also features a grand double-height foyer with coffered ceilings, a 30 metre wide mural by the famous Toronto-born artist R. York Wilson, cantilevering staircases that appear to be <b>floating,</b> <b>bright</b> bronze auditorium doors, and a fan-shaped auditorium with a huge curving balcony.|$|R

5000|$|Nuphar polysepala (the great yellow pond-lily or wokas; syn. Nuphar polysepalum orth. err., Nuphar lutea subsp. polysepala (Engelm.) E.O.Beal) is {{a species}} of Nuphar native to western North America. The name Nuphar is Greek for [...] "water-lily" [...] and polysepala means many sepals. It is {{commonly}} found in shallow muddy ponds from northern Alaska and Yukon southward to central California and northern New Mexico, and can be recognized easily by its large <b>floating</b> leaves and <b>bright</b> yellow blossoms.|$|R
5000|$|Sacklarian's artistic {{world is}} {{populated}} with whimsical biomorphic forms and amorphous figures that <b>float</b> against <b>bright,</b> angular backgrounds or subtle, dark fields of color. Sacklarian employs sophisticated use of perspective and composition, {{playing with the}} juxtaposition of style between his vivid biomorphic forms in the foreground and the unidentifiable geometric rooms in which they reside. Human and animal forms, limbs, faces, and abstract sexual organs hover in the foreground. The subconscious mind is a dominant threaded in Sacklarian’s work, and his paintings are notedly [...] "vividly abstract" [...] and dreamlike. Some are brooding, yet most are light and full of mischievous humor. Many have sly sexual references. Sacklarian's palette varied, yet favored bright rich colors. Despite his works' spontaneous appearance, Sacklarian claims to have at all times had the exact mental image of his desired piece prior to creation.|$|R
6000|$|Thus rode forth good Sir Richard of the Lea to pay {{his debt}} to Robin Hood this bright and merry morn. Along the highway they wended their way, with {{measured}} tramp of feet and rattle and jingle of sword and harness. Onward they marched till they came nigh to Denby, where, {{from the top of}} a hill, they saw, over beyond the town, many gay flags and streamers <b>floating</b> in the <b>bright</b> air. Then Sir Richard turned to the man-at-arms nearest to him. [...] "What is toward yonder at Denby today?" [...] quoth he.|$|R
60|$|She was right, it {{was indeed}} lovely. High in the heavens <b>floated</b> a <b>bright</b> half-moon, across whose face the little white-edged clouds drifted in quick succession, {{throwing}} their gigantic shadows to the world beneath. All silver was the sleeping sea where the moonlight fell upon it, and when this was eclipsed, then it was all jet. To the right and left, up to the very borders of the cliff, lay the soft wreaths of roke or land-fog, covering the earth as with a cloak of down, but pierced here and there by the dim and towering shapes of trees. Yet although these curling wreaths of mist hung {{on the edges of}} the cliff like white water about to fall, they never fell, since clear to the sight, though separated from them by a gulf of translucent blackness, lay the yellow belt of sand up which, inch by inch, the tide was creeping.|$|R
60|$|It was {{beautiful}} there, too, with the bright open fields hedged with great elms, and that ever-rich serenity of its grass and trees. The white house, timbered with dark beams in true Worcestershire fashion, and added-to {{from time to}} time, had preserved, thanks to a fine architect, an old-fashioned air of spacious presidency above its gardens and lawns. On the long artificial lake, with innumerable rushy nooks and water-lilies and coverture of leaves <b>floating</b> flat and <b>bright</b> in the sun, the half-tame wild duck and shy water-hens had remote little worlds, and flew and splashed when all Becket was abed, quite as if the human spirit, with its monkey-tricks and its little divine flame, {{had not yet been}} born.|$|R
60|$|Now {{as those}} knights and ladies {{who had been}} {{travelling}} all that day were anhungered with journeying, a repast had been spread in the open air, and all they sat at table with only the blue sky and the <b>bright</b> <b>floating</b> clouds above their heads for a canopy, and only the soft green grass and the pretty flowers beneath their feet for a carpet. And so as they sat, pages and attendants ran hither and thither with plates and dishes and pattens of silver and of gold full of meats of all kinds, and with beakers and pitchers and goblets of silver and of gold full of wines of various sorts; and with these foods the attendants served that noble company as they sat at table. And all {{the stillness of the}} forest was filled full of the noise of the chanting of many voices, and of laughter and of snatches of song. What time there stood near by several minstrels who played upon harps for the entertainment of those who ate at the table.|$|R
40|$|Zirconia nanocrystals doped with {{europium}} ions {{were developed}} envisaging optical applications. The nanostructures were produced using zirconyl nitrate (ZrO(NO 3) 2 ·H 2 O) and europium nitrate (Eu(NO 3) 3 · 5 H 2 O) as cation precursors, and urea (C 2 H 5 NO 2) as the fuel, by the combustion synthesis process. The lanthanide-doped nanostructures {{were characterized by}} X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, Raman spectroscopy and photoluminescence. X-ray diffraction revealed the presence of tetragonal and monoclinic crystalline ZrO 2 phases. The latter {{was found to be}} a minority phase as identified by Raman and corroborated by the observed europium luminescence when compared to the intraionic emission in crystalline tetragonal fibres grown by the laser <b>floating</b> zone technique. <b>Bright</b> red europium luminescence is observed at room temperature when the combustion synthesized zirconia powders are excited with ultraviolet radiation. The spectroscopic properties of the europium ions in the powders are ascertained by comparing combined excitation-emission measurements with those from crystalline fibresPartilhar documento na coleção da comunidade Laboratório Associado I 3 NPTDC/CTM/ 66195 / 2006 PTDC/CTM/ 100756 / 2008 SFRH/BD/ 80357 / 2011 SFRH/BD/ 45774 / 2008 SFRH/BD/ 68295 / 201...|$|R

40|$|A {{drop of a}} drying oil, i. e. an {{unsaturated}} glyceride:(linseed oil), spreads upon an oxidizing solution (MnO 4 K 0. 1 %) and forms, after a few hours, a thin, flexible <b>floating</b> membrane, showing <b>bright</b> interference colors; {{this indicates}} a thickness which can fall below 1 t ~ (Monnier and Monnier, 1964). This membrane can be floated on a saline solution and can support a drop of another solution. Thus it separates two distinct aqueous phases into each of which an Ag-AgCI-KCI electrode can be inserted. This constitutes {{a model of the}} cell membrane which exhibits curious analogies: excellent cation selectivity; hi-ionic potentials indicating different perme-ability toward the various cations (permeability for K + markedly greater than that for Na+); nonlinear current-voltage relation; excitability showing "responses" characterized by sudden and temporary increases of conductance; frequency of responses increasing with the current; impedance locus of the resting membrane represented by an almost perfect Cole's half-circle centered on the resistance axis (this allows the membrane to be described formally as a resistance and a capacity in parallel); charging time of the same order as that of some living excitable mem-branes (Monnier et al., 1965 a, b). Part of the above features can be attributed to anionic fixed charges induced in the membrane by its formative process, oxidative polymerization. Recent work has confirmed and extended these results...|$|R
40|$|The {{timing of}} {{freeze-up}} and break-up of Arctic lake ice is a potentially useful environmental indicator {{that could be}} monitored using SAR. In order to do this, {{it is important to}} understand how the properties and structure of the ice during its growth and decay affect radar backscatter and thus lake ice SAR signatures. The availability of radiometrically and geometrically calibrated digital SAR data time series from the Alaska SAR Facility has made it possible for the first time to quantify lake ice backscatter intensity (sigma(sup o)) variations. This has been done for ice growing on shallow tundra lakes near Barrow, NW Alaska, from initial growth in September 1991 until thawing and decay in June 1992. Field and laboratory observations and measurements of the lake ice were made in late April 1992. The field investigations of the coastal lakes near Barrow confirmed previous findings that, (1) ice frozen to the lake bottom had a dark signature in SAR images, indicating weak backscatter, while, (2) ice that was <b>floating</b> had a <b>bright</b> signature, indicating strong backscatter. At all sites, regardless of whether the ice was grounded or floating, there was a layer of clear, inclusion-free ice overlaying a layer of ice with dense concentrations of vertically oriented tubular bubbles. At some sites, there was a third layer of porous, snow-ice overlaying the clear ice...|$|R
