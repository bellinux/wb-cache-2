25|$|At {{the base}} of the column, {{material}} is forced upwards out of the vent by the pressure of expanding gas, mainly steam. The <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> because the pressure of rock above it rapidly reduces as it approaches the surface. This region is called the gas thrust region and typically reaches to only one or two kilometres above the vent.|$|E
25|$|Thermostats are {{sometimes}} used to regulate gas ovens. It {{consists of a}} gas-filled bulb connected to the control unit by a slender copper tube. The bulb is normally located {{at the top of}} the oven. The tube ends in a chamber sealed by a diaphragm. As the thermostat heats up, the <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> applying pressure to the diaphragm which reduces the flow of gas to the burner.|$|E
25|$|Another type of auto-reset {{mechanism}} uses an oil (hydraulic) and gas accumulator. Shock loads {{cause the}} oil to compress the gas, when the <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> again the leg returns to its working plowing position after passing over the obstacle. The most simple mechanism is a breaking (shear) bolt that needs replacement. Shear bolts which break when a plough body hits an obstruction are a cheaper overload protection device. It {{is important to}} use the correct replacement bolt.|$|E

5000|$|Power {{or working}} stroke: The {{pressure}} of the combustion gases pushes the piston downward, generating more work than it required to compress the charge. Complementary to the compression stroke, the combustion <b>gases</b> <b>expand</b> {{and as a result}} their temperature, pressure and density decreases. When the piston is near to BDC the exhaust valve opens. The combustion <b>gases</b> <b>expand</b> irreversibly due to the leftover pressure—in excess of back pressure, the gauge pressure on the exhaust port—; this is called the blowdown.|$|R
50|$|The {{inclusion}} of supersonic nozzles to collimate the <b>gases</b> <b>expanded</b> {{the variety and}} scope of experiments, {{and the use of}} lasers to excite the beams (either before impact or at the point of reaction) further broadened the applicability of this technique.|$|R
2500|$|The {{ratio of}} the value of [...] to that {{expected}} for an ideal gas at the same temperature is called the compressibility factor, [...] For a gas, this is typically less than unity at low temperature and greater than unity at high temperature (see the discussion in compressibility factor).

2500|$|Gas is tapped {{from the}} barrel as the bullet moves past a gas port located above the rifle's front sight base. The <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> into the port {{and down a}} gas tube, located above the barrel that runs from the front sight base into the AR-15's upper receiver. Here, the gas tube {{protrudes}} into a [...] "gas key" [...] (bolt carrier key), which accepts the gas and funnels it into the bolt carrier.|$|E
2500|$|In {{indirect}} fire mode the grenade support (more exactly named [...] "grenade enforcement ring" [...] in French) is moved forwards or backwards on the barrel which has markings (12/13?). This changes {{the position of}} the grenade on the barrel and automatically the volume of the chamber in which the <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> to push the grenade forward. Each position of the grenade support has a number which is multiplied by a certain fixed number depending on the alidade position, 45° or 75°; this will accurately indicate the firing distance of the grenade.|$|E
5000|$|Real gases have non-zero {{internal}} pressures {{because their}} internal energy changes as the <b>gases</b> <b>expand</b> isothermally - it can increase on expansion ( [...] , signifying presence of dominant attractive forces between the particles of the gas) or decrease ( [...] ,dominant repulsion).|$|R
50|$|After the turbine, the <b>gases</b> <b>expand</b> {{through the}} exhaust nozzle {{producing}} a high velocity jet. In a convergent nozzle, the ducting narrows progressively to a throat.

2500|$|... 100% oxygen is {{also used}} to {{replenish}} oxygen used by the diver in closed circuit rebreathers, to maintain [...] the set point [...] the partial pressure of oxygen in the loop that the electronics or diver maintains during the dive. In this case the actual breathing mixture varies with the depth, and is made up of a diluent blend mixed with oxygen. The diluent is usually a gas blend {{that can be used for}} bailout if necessary. Relatively small amounts of diluent are used in a rebreather, as the inert components are neither metabolised nor exhausted to the environment while the diver remains at depth, but are rebreathed repetitively, only being lost during ascent, when the <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> in inverse proportion to the pressure, and must be vented to maintain the correct volume in the loop.|$|E
60|$|That {{will carry}} us up very well indeed. When the balloon is nearly full--we never fill it entirely, for the <b>gas</b> <b>expands</b> when it rises into lighter air, and the balloon would explode {{if we did}} not leave room for this expansion--it is almost as round as a ball, and swells out proudly, {{struggling}} and pulling at the ropes which confine it to the ground.|$|E

50|$|The {{magnetic}} {{direct energy}} converter {{is analogous to}} the internal combustion engine.

40|$|This paper {{mechanistically}} {{investigates the}} dynamics of large and rapid landslides with long travel distance. In addition to many existing theories for friction reduction, the paper puts forward a new cause and mechanism of dense natural <b>gas</b> <b>expanding</b> and its governing equations and numerical results. The dense gas can have {{a huge amount of}} time-dependent expansion energy and pressure to deform, suddenly rupture and push the above rock and soil mass. Under gravity, the <b>expanding</b> dense <b>gas</b> and the broken rock and soil debris can rapidly flow, fly, and/or slide over and down the slope. The continued <b>gas</b> <b>expanding</b> and its almost zero shear strength beneath and within the debris solids carry them to powerfully move and travel to much longer distance. This process is rapidly completed and the debris solids deposit suddenly because the <b>expanding</b> dense <b>gas</b> can quickly and completely flow out of the solids and escape into sky...|$|R

5000|$|The surface {{atmospheric}} pressure on Mars varies annually around: 6.7-8.8 mbar and 7.5-9.7 mbar; daily around 6.4-6.8 mbar. Because {{of the pressure}} changes subsurface <b>gases</b> <b>expand</b> and contract periodically, causing a downward gas flow during increase of and expulsion during decrease of {{atmospheric pressure}}. [...] This cycle was first quantified with measurements of the surface pressure, which varies annually with amplitude of 25%.|$|R

He designed sensitive thermometers, hygrometers, hypsometers and calorimeters, and measured the specific heats of many substances and the {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} of gases. In the course of this work, he discovered that not all <b>gases</b> <b>expand</b> equally when heated and that Boyle's Law is only an approximation, especially at temperatures near a substance's boiling point.|$|R
50|$|Barotrauma {{occurs when}} the {{difference}} in pressure between the surroundings and the gas space makes the <b>gas</b> <b>expand</b> in volume, distorting adjacent tissues enough to rupture cells or damage tissue by deformation.

5000|$|The {{advantage}} of a plasma cannon is that it uses electricity as energy source.

25|$|The {{pressure}} {{changes during}} ascent and descent may affect gas {{spaces in the}} diver and diving equipment. A change in pressure will cause a pressure difference between the gas space and environment which will cause the <b>gas</b> to <b>expand</b> or compress if that is possible, and constraining the <b>gas</b> from <b>expanding</b> or compressing to balance the pressure may cause damage to the surrounding material or tissues by over-expansion or crushing.

Surges are identified in the deposits by dune and cross-bedding formations, which are not produced by fallout.|$|R
