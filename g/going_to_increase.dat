They knew {{that the amount of}} bullion produced was only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase,</b> and would likely drop the price of silver below the level ($1.2929 per troy ounce) at which the metal in a silver dollar was worth more as bullion than as money. In his explanatory statement accompanying his draft bill, Knox explained the discontinuance of the silver dollar would mean the United States was no longer a bimetallic nation. Boutwell, in his 1872 annual report, urged Congress to end the coinage of silver from private deposits, lest the government take a loss from paying out gold in exchange for the silver dollars, and ultimately having to melt them when they could not be circulated. According to Nugent, [...] "Were Knox, Linderman, Boutwell, Sherman, and others aware of what they were doing when they planned to drop the silver dollar? [...] It is inconceivable that they were not; Knox's statement was explicit. But did they urge it because they feared a drop in silver prices? [...] No one made an explicit statement to that effect, but it was undoubtedly the case." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the {{suspension}} of operations at {{three out of four}} BPI plants, members of the media and leaders were invited by Iowa Governor Terry Branstad to tour the BPI facility that remained open in South Sioux City, Nebraska. The founders of BPI gave campaign contributions to Branstad in 2010, and to other candidates' campaigns. Branstad stated to ABC News that the contributions were not a factor in his decision regarding having the event. Texas Governor Rick Perry, Nebraska Lieutenant Governor Rick Sheehy, Kansas Governor Sam Brownback, and South Dakota Lieutenant Governor Matt Michels, toured the South Sioux City, Nebraska, plant in an attempt to allay [...] "inaccurate information" [...] that they stated as having caused [...] "an unnecessary panic among consumers". The publicity tour emerged with the promotional slogan, [...] "Dude, it's beef!" [...] News reporters were not allowed to ask employees at BPI any questions during the tour. BPI asserts that social media and ABC News [...] "grossly misrepresented" [...] their product. BPI eventually sued ABC News for defamation. On March 28, 2012, Branstad stated, [...] "The problem is, we take this off the market, then we end up with a fatter product that's going to cost more and it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> the obesity problem in this country". Safeway and other retailers that have removed the product from their shelves or product lines have stated they will not raise the price of their beef. Branstad also stated that he would recommend that Iowa state public schools continue to use ground beef which contains the product, and stated plans to [...] "send a letter to the state's public schools, encouraging them to continue to buy LFTB".|$|E

The logistic function looks like an exponential at first but then tapers off and flattens completely. For example world population and the United States's oil production both appeared to be rising exponentially, but both have leveled off because they were logistic. Kurzweil says [...] "the knee in the curve" [...] {{is the time when}} the exponential trend is going to explode, while Modis claims if the process is logistic when you hit the [...] "knee" [...] the quantity you are measuring is only <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> by a factor of 100 more.|$|E

Unknown numbers of survivors do not have basic necessities such as food, water and medicines and remain inaccessible for relief operations, as roads, airports and bridges were destroyed or covered in wreckage." [...] The United Nations also began relief operations by this time; however, the severe damage to infrastructure hampered efforts to distribute supplies.

40|$|AbstractThis article uses nationally {{representative}} household-level panel data from Malawi {{to estimate how}} rural population density impacts agricultural intensification and household well-being. We find that areas of higher population density are associated with smaller farm sizes, lower real agricultural wage rates, and higher real maize prices. Any input intensification that occurs seems <b>to</b> be <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>increasing</b> maize yields, as we find no evidence that increases in population density enable farmers <b>to</b> <b>increase</b> gross value of crop output per hectare. We also find evidence that households in more densely populated areas increasingly rely on off-farm income to earn a living, but {{there appears to be}} a rural population density threshold beyond which households can no longer increase off-farm income per capita...|$|R
