50|$|On 1 February 1899, {{the club}} moved into Pittodrie Stadium which had {{previously}} been a <b>dung</b> <b>hill</b> for the city's police horses. They had previously played at Holburn Cricket Ground, the Aberdeen Grammar School grounds and The Chanonry.|$|E
50|$|Pittodrie’s {{original}} tenants {{were the}} original Aberdeen club, {{a precursor to}} Aberdeen FC, which along with other local clubs Victoria United and Orion amalgamated on 18 April 1903. Having previously played their football at various venues within the city, a former <b>dung</b> <b>hill</b> for police horses was chosen by Aberdeen to be cleared and readied for football on 1 February 1899. The land was leased from Mr Knight Erskine of Pittodrie with an agreement to construct a terrace on {{what is now the}} site of the Richard Donald Stand. On 2 September 1899, the first game was played in the new home, known then as Pittodrie Park; a 7-1 win over Dumbarton. On 15 August 1903, 8000 spectators turned up to watch the new Aberdeen FC draw 1-1 against Stenhousemuir, the first game played at Pittodrie by its amalgamated tenants.|$|E
25|$|Saltpeter {{harvesting}} {{was recorded}} by Dutch and German travelers as being common {{in even the}} smallest villages and was collected from the decomposition process of large <b>dung</b> <b>hills</b> specifically piled for the purpose. The Dutch punishment for possession of non-permitted gunpowder {{appears to have been}} amputation. Ownership and manufacture of gunpowder was later prohibited by the colonial Dutch occupiers. According to a colonel McKenzie quoted in Sir Thomas Stamford Raffles, The History of Java (1817), the purest sulfur was supplied from a crater from a mountain near the straits of Bali.|$|R
50|$|Dung middens, {{also known}} as <b>dung</b> <b>hills,</b> are piles of dung that mammals {{periodically}} return to and build up. They are used {{as a form of}} territorial marker. A range of animals are known to use them including steenbok, hyrax, and rhinoceros. Other animals are attracted to middens for a variety of purposes, including finding food and locating mates. Some species, such as the dung beetle genus Dicranocara of the Richtersveld in South western Africa spend their whole lifecycle in close association with dung middens. Dung middens are also used in the field of Paleobotany, which relies on the fact that each ecosystem is characterized by certain plants, which in turn act as a proxy for climate. Dung middens are useful as they often contain pollen which means fossilized dung middens can be used in Paleobotany to learn about past climates.|$|R
25|$|Rabbits live in warrens {{that contain}} two to 10 other {{individuals}} living in smaller groups to ensure greater breeding success. Territoriality and aggression contribute greatly to the rabbits maturation process and help ensure survival of the population. Mature male and females are better at fighting off predators. Females {{tend to be more}} territorial than males, although the areas most frequented by females are not defended. Rabbits mark their territories with <b>dung</b> <b>hills.</b> They expel soft, mucus-covered pellets that are sometimes reingested (coprophagy). They also expel larger pellets covered with secretions from the anal gland. A rabbit’s success in repelling strangers depends on the potency of the pellets. When young rabbits leave their natal warrens, they either settle in their pre-existing territories, take over unoccupied, formerly established territories, or become transients. Females tend to move into neighboring territories, while males tend to move further away.|$|R
40|$|From April 1998 to March 2000, 18 broiler flocks were {{followed}} from the hatchery to the slaughterhouse. Campylobacter {{was not found}} in the hatchery, 1 -day-old chicks or in the rearing house before the arrival of the chicks. The infection of broiler flocks increased continuously during the rearing time, with a total of seven positive flocks at the end of rearing. Farms with Campylobacter-positive broilers were characterized by the circulation of Campylobacter in the environment (puddles, <b>dung</b> <b>hill)</b> and on the footwear of the farmer. The administration of antibiotics did not significantly reduce Campylobacter shedding. With the exception of one flock during rearing and a few flocks in the slaughterhouse with a mixed Campylobacter coli-Campylobacter jejuni infection, C. jejuni exclusively was found both during rearing and on the carcasses. A significant correlation exits between the contamination of the broilers during rearing and the carcasses after processing. No slaughterhouse was able to avoid contamination of carcasses when status-positive animals were delivered. Moreover, six negatively delivered flocks yielded positive carcasses, the result of a supplementary contamination, which occurred during transport and slaughtering...|$|E
40|$|The steroids {{trenbolone}} acetate (TbA) and melengestrol acetate (MGA) are licensed as growth promoters for farm animals in several meat-exporting countries. Although {{many studies have}} explored their safety for both animals and consumers, {{little is known about}} their fate after excretion by the animal. Our study aimed to determine the residues and degradation of trenbolone and MGA in solid dung, liquid manure, and soil. In animal experiments lasting 8 weeks, cattle were treated with TbA and MGA. Solid dung and, in case of trenbolone, liquid manure were collected and spread on maize fields after 4. 5 and 5. 5 months of storage, respectively. Determination of the hormone residues in all samples included extraction, clean-up (solid-phase extraction), separation of metabolites and interfering substances by HPLC (RP- 18), and quantification by sensitive enzyme immunoassay. Procedures were validated by mass spectrometry (MS) methods. During storage of liquid manure the level of trenbolone decreased from 1, 700 to 1, 100 pg/g (17 alpha-isomer), corresponding to a half-life of 267 days. Before storage, the concentrations in the <b>dung</b> <b>hill</b> ranged from 5 to 75 ng/g TbOH and from 0. 3 to 8 ng/g MGA. After storage, levels up to 10 ng/g trenbolone, and 6 ng/g MGA were detected. In the soil samples trenbolone was traceable up to 8 weeks after fertilization, and MGA was detected even {{until the end of the}} cultivation period. The results show that these substances should be investigated further concerning their potential endocrine-disrupting activity in agricultural ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: Domestic waste collection, sorting and {{disposal}} are major problems {{in many developing}} countries such as Ghana. It is an undeniable fact that the environment has been engulfed in filth. This filth comprises of the garbage and waste generated in homes, workplace and industrial setups. Most of this waste has found its way into the streets, gutters, in and around the homes, <b>dung</b> <b>hills</b> and worst of all, water bodies, many of which are sources of the drinking water treated at high costs or not treated at all. Approach: Garbage needs to be sorted into various components and each of such components like textile materials, polythene, foodstuffs, metals and glassware would then have to be handled separately at the disposal or recycling site. Such a process required a certain degree of literacy, discipline and certain basic equipment, for example separate collector bins or sorting bags. In the developed world this is not much a problem because every home has different polythene bags into which the various constituents of domestic waste are put right at the generation point. Separate collection bins were also provided at vantage points for the various types of domestic garbage collection. In the developing countries these arrangements have not been feasible because of the level of literacy, lack of appreciation of the problem, non-availability of the different types of polythene bags and poverty. Currently, most garbage collection in the developing countries is done by depositing every thing into a single container from where they are hauled to be dumped in landfills or burned in incinerators. Refuse disposal by land filling requires a sizeable land {{for the sole purpose of}} refuse disposal. This may lead to (1) : Encumbering large tracks of prime land, which could not be put to other uses (2) : Pollution of ground water by the leachate from the landfills (3) : Breeding of leaches, rodents, mosquitoes and (4) : Generation of strong stench coming from the landfills, posing health hazards to communities. Incineration also produces strong odour and smoke. Results: In both methods no component of the waste was recovered for recycling. This is contrary to the practice in the developed countries where waste recycling is a major undertaking to provide raw materials e. g., glass and metal, for industry and thus reduces the exploitation of natural resources. Conclusion: To address the problem in Ghana it is necessary to devise a means of sorting-out the components of domestic waste for recycling into useful components. This study outlined the design and operation of a machine for sorting out garbage into the various components which can be recycled or utilized elsewhere...|$|R
40|$|Este trabalho teve como objetivo estudar a viabilidade {{ambiental}} da atividade de suinocultura na bacia do rio Mandurim, localizada na regiÃo Sudoeste do estado do ParanÃ. Foram avaliadas as caracterÃsticas fisiogrÃficas da bacia, com a determinaÃÃo dos principais usos e ocupaÃÃes do solo relacionadas com as faixas de declividade, caracterizaÃÃo das propriedades quanto aos plantÃis de suÃnos, estruturas de armazenamento e Ãreas aptas para aplicaÃÃo dos dejetos. Ainda, foi avaliada a qualidade da Ãgua do rio Mandurim no trecho onde Ã desenvolvida atividade de suinocultura. Os principais resultados indicam que a microbacia apresenta Ãreas aptas suficientes para receber os dejetos gerados, entretanto, todas as propriedades, apresentam capacidade de armazenamento de dejetos insuficientes, com dÃficit variando na faixa de 8 m 3 a 276 m 3, alÃm de 12 unidades (63 %) estarem localizadas em Ãrea de preservaÃÃo permanente. As anÃlises da Ãgua revelaram incrementos de matÃria orgÃnica, medida como DQO e DBO, entre os pontos de montante e de jusante da Ãrea de criaÃÃo de suÃnos. Entretanto, nÃo se pode afirmar que a atividade seja a Ãnica responsÃvel por esse aumento. Os demais parÃmetros, tais como nitrogÃnio, fÃsforo e oxigÃnio dissolvidos, exceto em picos esporÃdicos, atenderam aos padrÃes de qualidade para rio classe dois. This {{work had}} as objective {{to study the}} environmental viability of the swine breeding activity in the basin of the river Mandurim, which {{is located in the}} Southwest area of the of ParanÃ state. It was appraised the physiographic characteristics of the basin, with the determination of the principal uses and occupations of the soil related with the strips of steepness, characterization of the properties with relationship to the number of swine, storage structures and capable areas for application of the dejections. I, it was evaluated quality of the water river Mandurim in the space where the swine breeding activity is developed. The main results indicate that the micro basin presents enough capable areas to receive all the swineâs dejections, however, in all the properties, the <b>dung</b> <b>hills</b> present insufficient storage capacity, with deficit varies from strip of 8 m 3 to 276 m 3, besides 12 units (63 %) that are located in a permanent preservation area. The analyses of the water revealed increment of organic matter, measure like DQO and DBO, among the amount points of the swine breeding are of swine breeding, although none cannot affirm that the area swine activity is the only responsible for that increase. The other parameters, such as nitrogen, match and dissolved oxygen, in general, assisted to the quality pattern for rivers class two...|$|R
40|$|Veterinary medical product {{residues}} {{can cause}} severe {{damage in the}} dung ecosystem. Depending on the manner of application and the time after treatment, the excreted concentration of a given pharmaceutical varies. The popular anthelmintic drug ivermectin {{can be applied to}} livestock in several different ways and is fecally excreted over a period of days to months after application. In a field experiment replicated in summer and autumn, the authors mixed 6 ivermectin concentrations plus a null control into fresh cow dung to assess the reaction of the dung insect community. Taxon richness of the insect dung fauna emerging from the <b>dung,</b> but not <b>Hill</b> diversity (1 D) or the total number of individuals (abundance), decreased as ivermectin concentration increased. Corresponding declines in the number of emerging insects were found for most larger brachyceran flies and hymenopteran parasitoids, but not for most smaller nematoceran flies or beetles (except Hydrophilidae). Parallel pitfall traps recovered all major dung organism groups that emerged from the experimental dung, although at times in vastly different numbers. Ivermectin generally did not change the attractiveness of dung: differences in emergence therefore reflect differences in survival of coprophagous offspring of colonizing insects. Because sample size was limited to 6 replicates, the authors generally recommend more than 10 (seasonal) replicates and also testing higher concentrations than {{used in the present study}} as positive controls in future studies. Results accord with parallel experiments in which the substance was applied and passed through the cow’s digestive system. In principle, therefore, the authors’ experimental design is suitable for such higher-tier field tests of the response of the entire dung community to pharmaceutical residues, at least for ivermectin...|$|R
