5|$|The red-capped robin (Petroica goodenovii) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird {{native to}} Australia. Found in drier regions {{across much of the}} continent, it inhabits scrub and open woodland. Like many brightly coloured robins of the family Petroicidae, it is sexually dimorphic. Measuring 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) in length, the robin has a small thin black bill, and <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and legs. The male has a distinctive red cap and red breast, black upperparts, and a black tail with white tips. The underparts and shoulders are white. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown. This species uses a variety of songs, and males generally sing to advertise territories and attract females. Birds are encountered in pairs or small groups, but the social behaviour has been little studied.|$|E
5|$|The {{smallest}} of the red robins, the red-capped robin is 10.5–12.5cm (4–5in) long with a wingspan of 15–19.5cm (6–8in), and weighs around 7–9g (0.25–0.31oz). Males and females are of similar size. It has longer legs than the other robins of the genus Petroica. The male has a distinctive scarlet cap and breast. Its upperparts are jet black with white shoulder bars, and its tail black with white tips. The underparts and shoulder are white. All colours are sharply delineated from one another. The female is an undistinguished grey-brown above with a reddish tint to the crown, and paler underneath with dark brown wings and pale buff wing patch. Some females have a reddish tint to the breast. Both sexes have a small black bill, and <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and legs. Immature birds initially resemble the female; it is only with their second moult, which takes place at around or {{just over a year}} of age that males adopt their distinctive adult plumage. The red-capped robin moults once a year, after the breeding season which takes place between December and April.|$|E

The underparts of both morphs are whitish and streaked with brown. Feathers are moulted gradually between June and December.

500|$|Phedina {{is a small}} genus of {{passerine}} {{birds in}} the swallow family. It has two members, the Mascarene martin, Phedina borbonica, which has two subspecies in Madagascar and the Mascarene Islands respectively, and Brazza's martin, P. brazzae, which breeds in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Republic of the Congo, and northern Angola. The nearest relative of the Phedina martins is the banded martin, Riparia cincta, which resembles Brazza's martin in nesting habits and vocalisations. Both Phedina martins have grey-brown upperparts and paler, heavily streaked underparts. Adult Mascarene martins are [...] in length, and Brazza's martin is smaller at [...] long. Both species have brown wings, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>eyes</b> and a black bill and legs. Juvenile birds have more diffuse breast streaking and pale edges to the feathers of the back and wings than the adults. Both species can be distinguished from most other swallows in their breeding or wintering ranges by the streaking on the underparts and lack of a deeply forked tail. The Mascarene martin has a warbled siri-liri siri-liri song given in flight, but Brazza's martin has quite different vocalisations, its song consisting {{of a series of}} short notes followed by a complex buzz and sometimes some final clicks.|$|E
