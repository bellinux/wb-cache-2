5|$|Julia had {{two daughters}} with Dykins: Julia Baird (née Dykins - b. 5March 1947) and Jacqueline (Jackie) Dykins (b. 26October 1949). As <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> born prematurely, her mother visited the {{hospital}} {{every day to}} see her.|$|E
5|$|Jackie's friends Cindy, Andy, and Randall {{had become}} {{suspicious}} {{as to whether}} Jackie's date to the fraternity party where she was allegedly raped was a real person. Prior to the date, they attempted to locate him in a student directory and were unable to find evidence that he existed. The trio also sent text messages to a phone number Jackie said was the mobile phone of her date and were surprised that {{the owner of the}} phone number responded primarily with flattering messages about Randall, whom <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> romantically interested in.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from one}} guest {{appearance}} for Barbados {{in a friendly}} match early in 1939, Constantine did not play first-class cricket after 1935 until the West Indies toured England in 1939. Constantine had deliberately not signed a league contract in 1939, to be available for the tour. However, he was unhappy with the playing strength of the touring team and the £600 he was offered in wages. He believed that the captain, Rolph Grant (younger brother of <b>Jackie),</b> <b>was</b> unqualified for the job and had been appointed only because he was white. Constantine captained the side in one match, but was reprimanded by the West Indies board for not pursuing a win. The West Indies lost the three-match Test series 1–0 against a very strong England side, although critics judged the overall playing record of the team to be good. In the three Tests, Constantine scored 110 runs at 27.50 and took 11 wickets at 29.81, including five for 75 in the final Test.|$|E

25|$|During {{the period}} 1971 to 1986, Stewart covered F1 races, NASCAR races and Indianapolis 500 as a color commentator, and also functioned as host for the latter. <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> a play-by-play {{announcer}} for the Luge at the 1976 Winter Olympics and the Equestrian at the 1976 Summer Olympics (partnered with Chris Schenkel) on ABC's Wide World of Sports. He was noted for his insightful analysis, Scottish accent, and rapid delivery, which once caused Jim McKay to remark that Stewart spoke almost {{as fast as}} he drove.|$|E
25|$|In {{reviving}} the television series after a sixteen-year hiatus (1989–2005), executive producer Russell T Davies was keen {{to provide a}} believable background for the Doctor's companion and a context for her travels {{to the past and}} future. The character of <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> created, along with Rose's on/off boyfriend Mickey, to keep the series grounded in reality. In writing Jackie, Davies incorporated both comic and tragic elements. Following the departure of the Tyler family, Davies was keen to bring Jackie back alongside Rose for future appearances. Reviewers generally reacted positively {{to the development of the}} character, though some identified unlikeable traits.|$|E

25|$|After Latchmere, she {{attended}} Coombe Girls' School, which she still visits regularly. A lecture hall at Kingston University's Penrhyn Road campus {{has been named}} after her. After leaving school at age 16, she began training as a secretary but then applied {{to work with the}} Dundee-based publishing company DC Thomson on a new girls' magazine, Jackie. DC Thomson offered the 17-year-old a job after she penned a piece on the horrors of teen discos. She {{fell in love with a}} printer named Millar Wilson. When he joined the police force, the couple moved south for his work, marrying in 1965 when <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> 19. Two years later, they had a daughter, Emma. They divorced in 2004.|$|E
500|$|Julia's sister, Mimi, called Julia and Dykins' home—at 1 Blomfield Road, Liverpool—"The House of Sin" [...] and her {{own house}} (where Lennon lived) [...] "The House of Correction".

500|$|During {{a two-week}} trial in 1983, Andrew Wilson {{was convicted of}} the killings and given a death penalty sentence. His brother, <b>Jackie,</b> <b>was</b> convicted as an {{accomplice}} and given a life sentence. Both appealed their convictions. In 1985, Jackie's conviction was overturned by the Illinois Appellate Court because his {{right to remain silent}} had not been properly explained by the police.|$|E

500|$|... "Jackie was {{a college}} educated {{man who had been}} an officer in the service and who played at the Triple-A level. <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> brought in by Branch Rickey {{specifically}} to be the first black player in major league baseball. Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn't have time to get his full college education, and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season. I think, because of those circumstances, he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson. I don't think he has gotten the credit he deserves." ...|$|E
500|$|Fellow Jezebel writer Jia Tolentino {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of Erdely's story and reported on fraternity rush after the Rolling Stone article was discredited. [...] In her article Tolentino stated: [...] "Five years after I'd left the UVA Greek system, I read 'A Rape on Campus' as an outsider account about a true problem, written by someone good at cherry-picking... So {{it took me a}} day or two to admit that I found many of Erdely's details unrecognizable. No one says 'UVrApe'; no one I know has ever heard the Rugby Road-themed 'traditional fight song' that poetically ('fuck for 50 cents'/'panties on the fence') separated the article's sections... <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> lying, and railroaded into the spotlight on a story that now appears to be a PTSD-laced delusional flashback." ...|$|E
500|$|Keibler {{was chosen}} to record a track on the album WWE Originals. She and WWE music {{producer}} Jim Johnston recorded the song [...] "Why Can't We Just Dance?" [...] for the album. She was then placed in a feud involving Torrie Wilson and then-babyface, Sable, both of whom had recently posed for a Playboy cover. Keibler aligned with Miss Jackie, neither of whom had posed for the magazine, claiming that they deserved to be in Playboy over Sable and Wilson. Keibler and Jackie challenged Sable and Wilson to a Tag Team Evening Gown match at WrestleMania XX, which they lost when <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> pinned by Wilson, and the feud was dropped afterward. Before the feud was dropped, all the performers were playing face characters at the time.|$|E

500|$|Fraternity officials, who {{rejected}} the published allegations, noted {{a number of}} discrepancies in the story: there was no party held on the night that <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> allegedly raped, no fraternity member matched the description {{in the story of}} the [...] "ringleader" [...] of the rape, and details about the layout of the fraternity house provided by the accuser were wrong. Fraternity officials also noted that, prior to the Rolling Stone story, there had never been a criminal investigation or allegation of sexual assault against an undergraduate member of the chapter. Fraternity officials further disputed a claim in Erdely's piece that said the rape had occurred as part of a pledging ritual by observing that pledging on the UVa campus occurs in spring, not autumn as the story stated. They said that no pledges were resident in the fraternity at the time Erdely claimed.|$|E
500|$|... "Not Pictured" [...] {{would mark}} the final {{appearance}} by series regular Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson). When asked whether <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> {{done with the}} show, Thomas replied, [...] "She is. I would not hesitate for a second to have her come in to do an arc, but {{she will not be}} a series regular." [...] One notable recurring character absence in the finale is that of Gia Goodman (Krysten Ritter). Ritter wanted to appear in the episode, but she was unable to do so because of scheduling conflicts. [...] "It was unfortunate for me that I couldn't be in the finale episode (I booked a pilot) because I was looking forward to showing how everything that went down affected her. On a side note, I did start to think that I was responsible for the crash. I really wanted her to be a bad guy." [...] She would later appear in the Veronica Mars movie.|$|E
500|$|On December 10, 2014, The Washington Post {{published}} an updated account of its {{inquiry into the}} Rolling Stone article.

Writing in Slate, Hannah Rosin described the new Washington Post investigation as close [...] "to calling the UVA gang rape story a fabrication". Emily Renda, who was a University of Virginia student {{at the time of the}} alleged attack and in whom Jackie also confided, said that she had become suspicious as to the veracity of Jackie's story prior to the Rolling Stone report, commenting to a Washington Post editor: [...] "I don't even know what I believe." [...] In the aftermath, <b>Jackie</b> <b>was</b> characterized as [...] "a really expert fabulist storyteller" [...] by Rolling Stone publisher Jann Wenner in an April 5, 2015 interview.|$|E
