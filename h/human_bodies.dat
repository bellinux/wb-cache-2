5|$|Since {{at least}} the 1870s, American religious, medical, legislative, and legal {{commentators}} have debated contraception laws. Ana Garner and Angela Michel have found that in these discussions men often attach reproductive rights to moral and political matters, {{as part of an}} ongoing attempt to regulate <b>human</b> <b>bodies.</b> In press coverage between 1873–2013 they found a divide between institutional ideology and real-life experiences of women.|$|E

30|$|The {{three-dimensional}} personalized human {{modeling method}} proposed in this paper, through the user’s photo image processing {{to mention the}} <b>human</b> <b>body</b> contour and key feature areas and feature points to identify, gets the user’s key parts of the feature parameter information. Then, the network is trained by scanning enough <b>human</b> <b>body</b> scan data in the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> database to obtain a neural network model that can reflect <b>human</b> <b>body</b> characteristics (<b>human</b> <b>body</b> feature cross-section rings). According to the parameter information of the key parts such as height, chest circumference, waist circumference, and hip circumference obtained from the previous input, the neural network model obtained by training is directly generated to generate the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> characteristic curve that matches the real <b>human</b> <b>body</b> shape. Starting from the user’s photo information, a similar <b>human</b> <b>body</b> matching the user’s <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is searched in the 3 D scanning <b>human</b> <b>body</b> database.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explain the indoor thermal {{radiation}} environment of the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> in detail. Using a 3 -D <b>human</b> <b>body</b> model, shape factor calculations between a <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and surroundings are executed. First, the shape factor between the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and each surface of the room is calculated. The <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is placed in the center of the room. The shape factor results are visualized by VRML. Generated VRML images indicate the influence of thermal radiation, which the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> receives from the room surfaces. Second, the shape factor between the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> and surroundings (the room surfaces and some people) is calculated. Some "people influence " on the subject's <b>human</b> <b>body</b> is shown. And the shape factor variation with body position in the room is shown in detail...|$|R
30|$|Personalized {{clothing}} customization {{has become}} one of the important research directions in apparel design and manufacturing. Whether the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> model obtained by the 3 D human model can truly reflect the actual <b>human</b> <b>body</b> size and shape depends on the modeling principle and the implementation method. This paper presents a three-dimensional personalized human modeling method based on user photos and neural networks for costume design. The <b>human</b> <b>body</b> size information (size, outline points, and contour lines) is extracted based on the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> feature region and feature parameters based on the image; the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> three-dimensional cross-section information is generated by the three-dimensional <b>human</b> <b>body</b> feature curve based on the neural network. The similar three-dimensional <b>human</b> <b>body</b> that is searched in the three-dimensional <b>human</b> <b>body</b> database is a body shape information carrier, and the similar three-dimensional <b>human</b> <b>body</b> deformation is driven by the feature size and curve. The obtained information is merged and divided to quickly generate a three-dimensional personal body.|$|R
5|$|Elves {{are born}} about one year from their {{conception}}. The {{day of their}} conception is celebrated, not the actual birthday itself. Their minds develop more quickly than their bodies; by their first year, they can speak, walk and even dance, and their quicker onset of mental maturity makes young Elves seem, to Men, older than they really are. Physical puberty comes in around their fiftieth to one hundredth year (by age fifty they reach their adult height), and by their first hundred years of life outside the womb all Elves are fully grown. Elven bodies eventually stop aging physically, while <b>human</b> <b>bodies</b> do not.|$|E
5|$|Food is {{essential}} to life. Feeding more than seven billion <b>human</b> <b>bodies</b> takes a heavy toll on the Earth's resources. This begins with the appropriation of about 38% of the Earth's land surface and about 20% of its net primary productivity. Added to this are the resource-hungry activities of industrial agribusiness—everything from the crop need for irrigation water, synthetic fertilizers and pesticides to the resource costs of food packaging, transport (now {{a major part of}} global trade) and retail. Environmental problems associated with industrial agriculture and agribusiness are now being addressed through such movements as sustainable agriculture, organic farming and more sustainable business practices.|$|E

5|$|Most gods were {{depicted}} in several ways. Hathor {{could be a}} cow, cobra, lioness, or a woman with bovine horns or ears. By depicting a given god in different ways, the Egyptians expressed different aspects of its essential nature. The gods are {{depicted in}} {{a finite number of}} these symbolic forms, so that deities can often be distinguished from one another by their iconographies. These forms include men and women (anthropomorphism), animals (zoomorphism), and, more rarely, inanimate objects. Combinations of forms, such as gods with <b>human</b> <b>bodies</b> and animal heads, are common. New forms and increasingly complex combinations arose in the course of history, with the most surreal forms often found among the demons of the underworld. Some gods can only be distinguished from others if they are labeled in writing, as with Isis and Hathor. Because of the close connection between these goddesses, they could both wear the cow-horn headdress that was originally Hathor's alone.|$|E
5|$|The {{relief efforts}} were {{hindered}} by {{the composition of}} the mud, which made it nearly impossible to move through without becoming stuck. By the time relief workers reached Armero twelve hours after the eruption, many of the victims with serious injuries were dead. The relief workers were horrified by the landscape of fallen trees, disfigured <b>human</b> <b>bodies,</b> and piles of debris from entire houses. This was the second-deadliest volcanic disaster of the 20th century, surpassed only by the 1902 eruption of Mount Pelée, and is the fourth-deadliest volcanic event recorded since 1500 AD. The event was a foreseeable catastrophe exacerbated by the populace's unawareness of the volcano's destructive history; geologists and other experts had warned authorities and media outlets about the danger over the weeks and {{days leading up to the}} eruption. Hazard maps for the vicinity were prepared, but poorly distributed. On the day of the eruption, several evacuation attempts were made, but a severe storm restricted communications. Many victims stayed in their houses as they had been instructed, believing that the eruption had ended. The noise from the storm may have prevented many from hearing the sounds from Ruiz until it was too late.|$|E

40|$|Non-contact <b>human</b> <b>body</b> {{measurement}} {{plays an}} important role in surveillance, physical healthcare, on-line business and virtual fitting. Current methods for measuring the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> without physical contact usually cannot handle humans wearing clothes, which limits their applicability in public environments. In this paper, we propose an effective solution that can measure accurate parameters of the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> with large-scale motion from a Kinect sensor, assuming that the people are wearing clothes. Because motion can drive clothes attached to the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> loosely or tightly, we adopt a space-time analysis to mine the information across the posture variations. Using this information, we recover the <b>human</b> <b>body,</b> regardless of the effect of clothes, and measure the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> parameters accurately. Experimental results show that our system can perform more accurate parameter estimation on the <b>human</b> <b>body</b> than state-of-the-art methods...|$|R
