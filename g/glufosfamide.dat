50|$|<b>Glufosfamide,</b> being a {{conjugate}} of glucose {{and active}} alkylating moiety of ifosfamide, has the better cell permeability than the parent compound — ifosfamide — or its metabolites. <b>Glufosfamide</b> utilizes the normal cell glucose transport mechanism (a sodium-dependent glucose/sodium co-transporter) {{for its own}} transport into the cell. And the glucose uptake mechanism is grossly overexpressed and upregulated in certain cancer cell lines, especially pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, and glioblastoma multiforme.

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Glufosfamide</b> {{is a new}} {{alkylating agent}} in which the active {{metabolite}} of isophosphoramide mustard is covalently linked to beta-D-glucose to target the glucose transporter system and increase intracellular uptake in tumor cells. We investigated this drug in a multicenter prospective phase II trial in recurrent glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eligible patients had recurrent GBM following surgery, radiotherapy {{and no more than}} one prior line of chemotherapy. Patients were treated with <b>glufosfamide</b> 5000 mg/m(2) administered as a 1 -h intravenous infusion. Treatment success was defined as patients with either an objective response according to Macdonald's criteria or 6 months progression-free survival. Toxicity was assessed with the Common Toxicity Criteria (CTC) version 2. 0. RESULTS: Thirty-one eligible patients were included. Toxicity was modest, the main clinically relevant toxicities being leukopenia (CTC grade > 3 in five patients) and hepatotoxicity (in three patients). No responses were observed; one patient (3 %; 95 % confidence interval 0 to 17 %) was free from progression at 6 months. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed a 15 % decrease in area under the curve and <b>glufosfamide</b> clearance in patients treated with enzyme-inducing antiepileptic drugs, but no effect of these drugs on maximum concentration and plasma half-life.

40|$|The {{activity}} of <b>glufosfamide</b> (beta-D-glucopyranosyl-N,N'-di-(2 -chloroethyl) -phosphoric acid diamide) against pancreatic cancer {{was investigated in}} a multicentre, phase II clinical study. Chemotherapy-nai;ve patients with advanced or metastatic disease were treated with <b>glufosfamide</b> (5 g/m(2)) using a 1 -h intravenous (i. v.) infusion every 3 weeks. Patients were randomised between active-hydration and normal fluids to evaluate the nephroprotective effect of forced diuresis. Patients experiencing > 0. 4 mg/dl (> 35 micromol/l) increase in serum creatinine compared with their baseline value were taken off treatment for safety reasons. The evaluation of response was according to the Response evaluation criteria in solid tumours (RECIST). Blood sampling was performed for pharmacokinetic analyses. 35 patients from 13 institutions were registered over a 13 -month period. A total of 114 treatment cycles (median 3, range 1 - 8) were administered to 34 patients; 18 patients were allocated to the hydration arm. Overall haematological toxicity was mild. Metabolic acidosis occurred in 2 patients treated in the active-hydration arm, grade 3 hypokalaemia was recorded in 5 patients and grade 3 hypophosphataemia in 4 patients. One patient had a grade 4 increase in serum creatinine level, concomitantly to disease progression. Active-hydration did not show a nephroprotective effect and the plasma pharmacokinetics (Pk) of <b>glufosfamide</b> was not significantly influenced by hydration. Two confirmed partial remissions (PR) were reported (response rate 5. 9 %, 95 % Confidence Interval (CI) 0. 7 - 19. 7 %) and 11 cases obtained disease stabilisation (32. 4 %). An extra mural review panel confirmed all of the responses. Median overall survival was 5. 3 months (95 % CI 3. 9 - 7. 1) and time to progression (TTP) was 1. 4 months (95 % CI 1. 3 - 2. 7). In conclusion, <b>glufosfamide</b> administered using a 1 -h infusion every 3 weeks has a modest activity in advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma.

40|$|The oxazaphosphorines {{including}} cyclophosphamide (CPA, Cytoxan, or Neosar), ifosfamide (IFO, Ifex) and trofosfamide (Ixoten) {{represent an}} important group of therapeutic agents {{due to their}} substantial antitumor and immunomodulating activity. However, several intrinsic limitations have been uncounted during the clinical use of these oxazaphosphorines, including substantial pharmacokinetic variability, resistance and severe host toxicity. To circumvent these problems, new oxazaphosphorines derivatives have been designed and evaluated with an attempt to improve the selectivity and response with reduced host toxicity. These include mafosfamide (NSC 345842), <b>glufosfamide</b> (D 19575, β-Dglucosylisophosphoramide mustard), S-(-) -bromofosfamide (CBM- 11), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine) and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). Mafosfamide is an oxazaphosphorine analog that is a chemically stable 4 -thioethane sulfonic acid salt of 4 -hydroxy-CPA. <b>Glufosfamide</b> is IFO derivative in which the isophosphoramide mustard, the alkylating metabolite of IFO, is glycosidically linked to a β-D-glucose molecule. Phase II studies of <b>glufosfamide</b> {{in the treatment of}} pancreatic cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NCSLC), and recurrent glioblastoma multiform (GBM) have recently completed and Phase III trials are ongoing, while Phase I studies of intrathecal mafosfamide have recently completed for the treatment of meningeal malignancy secondary to leukemia, lymphoma, or solid tumors. S-(-) - bromofosfamide is a bromine-substituted IFO analog being evaluated in a few Phase I clinical trials. The synthesis and development of novel oxazaphosphorine analogs with favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties still constitutes a great challenge for medicinal chemists and cancer pharmacologists. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Oxazaphosphorines {{belong to}} a group of alkylating agents. Mafosfamide {{cyclohexylamine}} salt (D- 17272), 4 -hydro-peroxy-cyclophosphamide (D- 18864) and <b>glufosfamide</b> (D- 19575, β-D-glucose-isophosphoramide mustard) are new generation oxazaphosphorines. The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the cytotoxic action of these oxazaphosphorine compounds against human histiocytic lymphoma U 937 cells.

40|$|The oxazaphosphorines {{including}} cyclophosphamide (CPA), ifosfamide (IFO), and trofosfamide {{represent an}} important group of therapeutic agents {{due to their}} substantial antitumor and immuno-modulating activity. CPA is widely used as an anticancer drug, an immunosuppressant, and for the mobilization of hematopoetic progenitor cells from the bone marrow into peripheral blood prior to bone marrow transplantation for aplastic anemia, leukemia, and other malignancies. New oxazaphosphorines derivatives have been developed {{in an attempt to}} improve selectivity and response with reduced toxicity. These derivatives include mafosfamide (NSC 345842), <b>glufosfamide</b> (D 19575, β-D-glucosylisophosphoramide mustard), NSC 612567 (aldophosphamide perhydrothiazine), and NSC 613060 (aldophosphamide thiazolidine). This review highlights the metabolism and transport of these oxazaphosphorines (mainly CPA and IFO, as these two oxazaphosphorine drugs are the most widely used alkylating agents) and the clinical implications. Both CPA and IFO are prodrugs that require activation by hepatic cytochrome P 450 (CYP) -catalyzed 4 -hydroxylation, yielding cytotoxic nitrogen mustards capable of reacting with DNA molecules to form crosslinks and lead to cell apoptosis and/or necrosis. Such prodrug activation can be enhanced within tumor cells by the CYP-based gene directed-enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) approach. However, those newly synthesized oxazaphosphorine derivatives such as <b>glufosfamide,</b> NSC 612567 and NSC 613060, do not need hepatic activation. They are activated through other enzymatic and/or non-enzymatic pathways. For example, both NSC 612567 and NSC 613060 can be activated by plain phosphodiesterase (PDEs) in plasma and other tissues or by the high-affinity nuclear 32 ̆ 7 - 52 ̆ 7 exonucleases associated with DNA polymerases, such as DNA polymerases and ε. The alternative CYP-catalyzed inactivation pathway by N-dechloroethylation generates the neurotoxic and nephrotoxic byproduct chloroacetaldehyde (CAA). Various aldehyde dehydrogenases (ALDHs) and glutathione S-transferases (GSTs) are involved in the detoxification of oxazaphosphorine metabolites. The metabolism of oxazaphosphorines is auto-inducible, with the activation of the orphan nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) being the major mechanism. Oxazaphosphorine metabolism is affected by a number of factors associated with the drugs (e. g., dosage, route of administration, chirality, and drug combination) and patients (e. g., age, gender, renal and hepatic function). Several drug transporters, such as breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP), multidrug resistance associated proteins (MRP 1, MRP 2, and MRP 4) are involved in the active uptake and efflux of parental oxazaphosphorines, their cytotoxic mustards and conjugates in hepatocytes and tumor cells. Oxazaphosphorine metabolism and transport {{have a major impact on}} pharmacokinetic variability, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship, toxicity, resistance, and drug interactions since the drug-metabolizing enzymes and drug transporters involved are key determinants of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oxazaphosphorines. A better understanding of the factors that affect the metabolism and transport of oxazaphosphorines is important for their optional use in cancer chemotherapy. <br /...|$|E
40|$|The oxazaphosphorines cyclophosphamide, {{ifosfamide}} and trofosfamide {{remain a}} clinically useful class of anticancer drugs with substantial antitumour activity against {{a variety of}} solid tumors and hematological malignancies. A major limitation to their use is tumour resistance, {{which is due to}} multiple mechanisms that include increased DNA repair, increased cellular thiol levels, glutathione S-transferase and aldehyde dehydrogenase activities, and altered cell-death response to DNA damage. These mechanisms have been recently re-examined with the aid of sensitive analytical techniques, high-throughput proteomic and genomic approaches, and powerful pharmacogenetic tools. Oxazaphosphorine resistance, together with dose-limiting toxicity (mainly neutropenia and neurotoxicity), significantly hinders chemotherapy in patients, and hence, there is compelling need to find ways to overcome it. Four major approaches are currently being explored in preclinical models, some also in patients: combination with agents that modulate cellular response and disposition of oxazaphosphorines; antisense oligonucleotides directed against specific target genes; introduction of an activating gene (CYP 3 A 4) into tumor tissue; and modification of dosing regimens. Of these approaches, antisense oligonucleotides and gene therapy are perhaps more speculative, requiring detailed safety and efficacy studies in preclinical models and in patients. A fifth approach is the design of novel oxazaphosphorines that have favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties and are less vulnerable to resistance. Oxazaphosphorines not requiring hepatic CYP-mediated activation (for example, NSC 613060 and mafosfamide) or having additional targets (for example, <b>glufosfamide</b> that also targets glucose transport) have been synthesized and are being evaluated for safety and efficacy. Characterization of the molecular targets associated with oxazaphosphorine resistance may lead to {{a deeper understanding of the}} factors critical to the optimal use of these agents in chemotherapy and may allow the development of strategies to overcome resistance. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Background. <b>Glufosfamide</b> (GLU) is a glucose {{conjugate}} of ifosfamide {{in which}} isophosphoramide mustard is glycosidically {{linked to the}} β-D-glucose molecule. Based on GLU structure, it is considered a targeted chemotherapy with fewer side effects. The main objective {{of the current study}} is to assess the cytotoxic potential of GLU {{for the first time in}} prostate cancer (PC) cells representing different stages of the tumor. Furthermore, this study examined the potential synergistic activity of GLU in combination with docetaxel (DOC). Methods. Two different cell lines were used, LNCaP and PC- 3. Concentration-response curves were assessed. The tested groups per cell line were, control, GLU, DOC and combination. Treatment duration was 72 h. Cytotoxicity was assessed using sulforhodamine B (SRB) assay and half maximal inhibitory concentration (IC 50) was calculated. Synergy analyses were performed using Calcusyn®software. Subsequent mechanistic studies included β-glucosidase activity assay, glucose uptake and apoptosis studies, namely annexin V-FITC assay and the protein expression of mitochondrial pathway signals including Bcl- 2, Bax, Caspase 9 and 3 were assessed. Data are presented as mean ± SD; comparisons were carried out using one way analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Tukey-Kramer’s test for post hoc analysis. Results. GLU induced cytotoxicity in both cell lines in a concentration-dependent manner. The IC 50 in PC- 3 cells was significantly lower by 19 % when compared to that of LNCaP cells. The IC 50 of combining both drugs showed comparable effect to DOC in PC- 3 but was tremendously lowered by 49 % compared to the same group in LNCaP cell line. β-glucosidase activity was higher in LNCaP by about 67 % compared to that determined in PC- 3 cells while the glucose uptake in PC- 3 cells was almost 2 folds that found in LNCaP cells. These results were directly correlated to the efficacy of GLU in each cell line. Treatment of PC cells with GLU as single agent or in combination with DOC induced significantly higher apoptosis as evidenced by Annexin V-staining. Apoptosis was significantly increased in combination group by 4. 9 folds and by 2. 1 Folds when compared to control in LNCaP cells and PC- 3 cells; respectively. Similarly, the expression of Bcl- 2 was significantly decreased while Bax, caspase 9 and 3 were significantly increased in the combined treatment groups compared to the control. Conclusion. GLU has a synergistic effect in combination with DOC as it increases the cell kill which can be attributed at least partially to apoptosis in both the tested cell lines and it is suggested as a new combination regimen to be considered in the treatment of the prostate cancer. Further experiments and clinical investigations are needed for assessment of that regimen...|$|E
