5000|$|Key dates: 1520-1600Artists of the Early Renaissance and the High Renaissance {{developed}} their characteristic styles from {{the observation of}} nature and the formulation of a pictorial science. When Mannerism matured after 1520(The year Raphael died), all the representational problems had been solved. A body of knowledge was there to be learned. Instead of nature as their teacher, Mannerist artists took art. While Renaissance artists sought nature to find their style, the Mannerists looked first for a style and found a manner. In Mannerist paintings, compositions can have no focal point, space can be ambiguous, figures can be characterized by an athletic bending and twisting with distortions, exaggerations, an <b>elastic</b> <b>elongation</b> of the limbs, bizarre posturing on one hand, graceful posturing on the other hand, and a rendering of the heads as uniformly small and oval. The composition is jammed by clashing colors, which is unlike what we've seen in the balanced, natural, and dramatic colors of the High Renaissance. Mannerist artwork seeks instability and restlessness. There is also a fondness for allegories that have lascivious undertones.

The objective {{of this study is}} to develop a numerical model based on microstructural images of concrete and fundamental material properties of each constituent of concrete subjected to alkali-silica reaction (ASR). A microstructure-based finite element approach is employed directly to analyze the mechanical response of concrete to ASR. The modeling work involves acquiring and processing of microstructural images of specimens suffering from ASR using scanning electron microscopy, and implementing finite element program to analyze the microstructural images. The formulation of this model is based on pressure caused by the ASR product and on properties such as Young’s modulus and Poisson’s ratio. The {{finite element analysis}} program used to simulate structural behavior of structures attacked by ASR is object-oriented finite element developed at National Institute of Standards and Technology. The numerical results from this model are compared with experimental data, which have been measured using ASTM standard test C 1260.

There have been concerns raised about the safe usability of titanium 6 - 4 in the aerospace industry due to its lack of strain hardening.

40|$|AbstractCell-shape {{changes are}} insured by a thin, dynamic, {{cortical}} layer of cytoskeleton underneath the plasma membrane. How this thin cortical structure impacts the mechanical {{properties of the}} whole cell is not fully understood. Here, we study the mechanics of liposomes or giant unilamellar vesicles, when a biomimetic actin cortex is grown at the inner layer of the lipid membrane via actin-nucleation-promoting factors. Using a hydrodynamic tube-pulling technique, we show that tube dynamics is clearly affected {{by the presence of}} an actin shell anchored to the lipid bilayer. The same force pulls much shorter tubes {{in the presence of the}} actin shell compared to bare membranes. However, in both cases, we observe that the dynamics of tube extrusion has two distinct features characteristic of viscoelastic materials: rapid <b>elastic</b> <b>elongation,</b> followed by a slower elongation phase at a constant rate. We interpret the initial elastic regime by an increase of membrane tension due to the loss of lipids into the tube. Tube length is considerably shorter for cortex liposomes at comparable pulling forces, resulting in a higher spring constant. The presence of the actin shell seems to restrict lipid mobility, as is observed in the corral effect in cells. The viscous regime for bare liposomes corresponds to a leakout of the internal liquid at constant membrane tension. The presence of the actin shell leads to a larger friction coefficient. As the tube is pulled from a patchy surface, membrane tension increases locally, leading to a Marangoni flow of lipids. As a conclusion, the presence of an actin shell is revealed by its action that alters membrane mechanics...|$|E
