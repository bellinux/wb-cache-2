5|$|From August 1942 to February 1943, Berg was on {{assignment}} in the Caribbean and South America. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> monitor {{the health and}} physical fitness of the American troops stationed there. Berg, along with several other OIAA agents, left in June 1943 because they thought South America posed little threat to the United States, {{and they wanted to}} be someplace where their talents would be put to better use.|$|E

5|$|<b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> prepare staff {{studies on}} {{upcoming}} potential operations. While {{he did do}} naval planning, his team prepared plans that coordinated land, air and sea operations. A staff study might be put into effect and become an operation, or MacArthur might shelve it {{in favor of an}} alternative operation, especially if the staff study revealed that it would be too time-consuming, difficult or costly. The three teams would work simultaneously on three different objectives in leapfrog fashion. Tarbuck routinely attended staff conferences that involved naval matters.|$|E
5|$|Fincher {{realized}} that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> dispel the mythic stature {{the case had}} taken on {{over the years by}} clearly defining what was fact and what was fiction. He told Vanderbilt that he wanted the screenplay re-written but with additional research done from the original police reports. Fincher found {{that there was a lot}} of speculation and hearsay and wanted to interview people directly involved in the case in person to see if he believed what they were telling him. Fincher did this because he felt a burden of responsibility in making a film that convicted someone posthumously.|$|E
5|$|At 13:45, Chain Home radar {{picked up}} the German raids. No. 11 Group {{scrambled}} one Spitfire from RAF Hawkinge on the channel coast. Flown by No. 92 Squadron Pilot Officer Alan Wright, <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> climb {{as quickly as possible}} over the sea and act as a spotter. He was to report on the direction, height, composition and strength of the German formation. The radar operators assessed the strengths of the three largest formations at 30, 50, and 60 plus. Five smaller formations added up to 85 plus. In fact, the British estimate of 225 aircraft proved too small. The German force was 475 aircraft strong. Shortly before 14:00, the German formation left the French coast. Park ordered his forces to repeat the earlier interception tactic. Four pairs of squadrons were ordered to patrol Sheerness, Chelmsford, Hornchurch and RAF Kenley.|$|E

González explained that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{make sure that all}} these front companies had offices that reflected the capital that they allegedly had and the services that they were supposed to offer; he also looked for mock stockholders and board members that fit the profile for the supposed type of companies.|$|E

25|$|In 1993, Modi {{established}} Modi Entertainment Networks (MEN), using {{money from}} a family trust. MEN started as a 10-year joint venture with Walt Disney Pictures, to broadcast some of Disney's content in India, including Fashion TV. In 1994, MEN became the pan-India distributor of ESPN on a ten-year contract worth $975 million. <b>His</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> collect money from the cable companies in India in exchange for them broadcasting ESPN. ESPN did not renew its contract with Modi, alleging that he underreported revenues. MEN also lost a contract with Fashion TV, after Modi fell out with its founder Michel Adam Lisowski. Most of Modi's businesses in Mumbai were not profitable, and he lived on a maintenance allowance from his father's company.|$|E
25|$|Since {{his first}} {{involvement}} with Yorkshire in 1948, Trueman {{had been working}} a winter job at Maltby Main in the tally office (contrary {{to one of the}} urban myths about him, he was never actually a miner). Yorkshire had encouraged him to work for the National Coal Board so that he would be in a reserved occupation and so avoid national service. But in the winter of 1950–51, he learned that <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> be declassified and that he would be liable for call-up at some stage. He decided to volunteer after the 1951 season and, at the same time, take advantage of a new Yorkshire committee ruling that any capped players who were called up would be paid £5 a week, which was a good wage at the time.|$|E
25|$|He joined Senator John Kerry's 2004 presidential {{campaign}} soon after graduation from the College of the Holy Cross. While {{working for the}} Kerry campaign, <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> assemble audio clips of talk radio programs for the Kerry camp to review for the next day. When the Kerry campaign began to falter at one point, they found themselves without a speechwriter, and Favreau was promoted {{to the role of}} deputy speechwriter. Following Kerry's defeat, Favreau became dispirited with politics, and was uncertain if he would do such work again. Favreau first met Obama (then an Illinois State Senator running for the U.S. Senate), while still working for Kerry, backstage at the 2004 Democratic National Convention as Obama was rehearsing his keynote address. Favreau, then 23 years old, interrupted Obama's rehearsal, advising the soon-to-be-elected Senator that a rewrite was needed to avoid an overlap with Kerry's address.|$|E

25|$|In 1839 at {{a meeting}} of the London Zoological Society George Robert Waterhouse {{described}} the Syrian hamster as a new species. His identification of the animal happened after his 1835 appointment as a curator of the museum of the London Zoological Society, where <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> process mammal specimens. The body in the museum became the type specimen for the new species. There is no record of who collected the specimen nor is there any record of who donated the body to that museum. In 1853 the British Museum purchased the collections of the London Zoological Society, so now, this original hamster is in the British Museum as specimen BM(NH) 1855.12.24.120. Some derivative works of the Waterhouse publication which also presented the existence of the hamster were Louis Fraser's 1849 Zoologia Typica, Christoph Gottfried Andreas Giebel's 1855 Säugetiere, and Henry Baker Tristram's 1884 Fauna and Flora of Palestine.|$|E
25|$|During the Korean War, a Chinese army {{offensive}} {{broke through}} the UN lines in January 1951 and was rapidly advancing south. The South Korean army was ordered to burn all of the buildings in the Odae Mountains in order to deny shelter to the advancing Chinese troops. WolJeong Temple could be seen burning when a squad of South Korean soldiers arrived at Sangwon Temple. Explaining their mission, they ordered everyone to pack what they could and leave immediately. Instead, Hanam Sunim returned to the Dharma Hall, put on his formal robe, and, sitting down, told the lieutenant {{to go ahead and}} burn the buildings. Hanam Sunim then told the lieutenant that his since <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> stay with the temple, and the lieutenant's was to burn it, there would be no conflict(or bad karma) because they were both just doing their job. The lieutenant couldn't get Hanam Sunim to leave, and so at great risk to himself (for disobeying orders in wartime) he instead piled all of the wooden doors and window shutters in the courtyard and burned those instead. In this way, Sangwon Temple {{was one of the few}} temples in this area to survive the war.|$|E
500|$|St Peter's Field was a croft (an open {{piece of}} land) {{alongside}} Mount Street which was being cleared {{to enable the}} last section of Peter Street to be constructed.

Known for his dedication to maintaining high standards in the food industry, he relished arguing court cases [...] "in defense of sanitary practices in the handling and processing of perishable foods". In one noted case involving the adulteration of tomato catsup, he presented partially rotten tomatoes to the jury, and, concluding his testimony, asked them [...] "Should the American people have to eat these in their catsup?" ...|$|E

A part of <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> write propaganda leaflets spread by the Soviet Red Army in Korea. Biographer Tatiana Gabroussenko thinks {{it is probable that}} he also translated the first speech given by Kim Il-sung after the liberation, on 14 October 1945, called [...] "Every Effort for the Building of a New Democratic Korea", into Korean. The original speech was written by Soviet officers. Cho entered North Korea with the Red army that year.|$|E

He was then posted back to the 4th Infantry Battalion as the Transport Officer. He observed the landing at Gallipoli from the transport SS Lake Michigan, but did not go ashore with the battalion, as <b>his</b> <b>job</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{take care of the}} horses. He re-joined the battalion on shore on 8 May 1915.
