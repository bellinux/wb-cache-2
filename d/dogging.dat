5|$|Although {{the plan}} was {{theoretically}} sound, it was ineffective in stimulating economic growth. During Diem's time, there was little meaningful economic investment or development of infrastructure. The businessmen mostly used the import subsidies to purchase consumer goods such as boats, motorbikes, refrigerators, radios, music systems and other similar goods, which were luxuries at the time. The program was thus effective in expanding {{the size of the}} urban middle class, but it did not generate much economic investment. Only a minority of the purchases were of capital goods such as manufacturing equipment and supplies for factory production. As a result, not much of the subsidies created more economic production. The government funds generated from selling importing licenses also became a problem, with corruption and explicit theft <b>dogging</b> its effectiveness as a means of bankrolling the military and civil service. In addition, some government officials would not sell the coveted licenses to the businessmen until a bribe was paid. Another criticism of the CIP was that the funds collected by the government were not used for any significant amount of government-sector economic investment but mainly to fund the army. Diem defended this by stating that national security was paramount.|$|E

2500|$|Diogenes was a {{controversial}} figure. His father minted coins for a living, and when Diogenes took to debasement of currency, he was banished from Sinope.

In a highly nontraditional fashion, he had a reputation of sleeping and eating wherever he chose and took to toughening himself against nature. He declared himself a cosmopolitan and a citizen of the world rather than claiming allegiance to just one place. There are many tales about him <b>dogging</b> Antisthenes' footsteps and becoming his [...] "faithful hound". Diogenes made a virtue of poverty. He begged for a living and often slept in a large ceramic jar in the marketplace.

Diogenes was also noted for having publicly mocked Alexander the Great.|$|E

[...] Asked about Staley's death in an interview with MTV in July 2002, Cantrell said: [...] "It's something I'm still dealing with, and I still think like he's here. I miss him tremendously. I love him and have to move on. I'll remember him and respect the memories of what we did together and just enjoy life... and that's all I'll say about it." [...] William DuVall, who performed Staley's vocals during Cantrell's solo concerts, elaborated on this emotional period saying: [...] "I lost my grandfather in the same week, so Cantrell and I both hit the road with immense personal losses <b>dogging</b> us. There were times on stage—there was one show in Charlotte where it was just so heavy. I'm holding back tears onstage, and Jerry would start crying onstage too a lot at that point, and a lot of times we would just look at each other when we were singing the stuff because it was the only way... it was heavy. I can't quantify it really in words." [...] Cantrell canceled the show that he was scheduled to perform at Zephyrhills's Livestock Festival on April 28 in order to attend Staley's funeral in Seattle in the same day. Cantrell dedicated his solo album, Degradation Trip, released two months after Staley's death, to his memory. He also adopted Staley's cat, a female siamese named Sadie, after his death.
