40|$|BACKGROUND: The Intercept Blood SystemTM (Cerus) {{is used to}} {{inactivate}} pathogens in platelet concentrates (PC). The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate the extent to which the <b>Intercept</b> <b>treatment</b> modifies the functional properties of platelets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A two-arm study was conducted initially to compare buffy coat-derived pathogen-inactivated PC to untreated PC (n= 5) throughout storage. A four-arm study was then designed to evaluate the contribution of the compound adsorbing device (CAD) and ultraviolet (UV) illumination to the changes observed upon <b>Intercept</b> <b>treatment.</b> Intercept-treated PC, CAD-incubated PC, and UV-illuminated PC were compared to untreated PC (n= 5). Functional characteristics were assessed using flow cytometry, hypotonic shock response (HSR), aggregation, adhesion assays and flow cytometry for the detection of CD 62 P, CD 42 b, GPIIb-IIIa, phosphatidylserine exposure and JC- 1 aggregates. RESULTS: Compared to fresh platelets, end-of-storage platelets exhibited greater passive activation, disruption of the mitochondrial transmembrane potential (Δψm), and phosphatidylserine exposure accompanied by a decreased capacity to respond to agonist-induced aggregation, lower HSR, and CD 42 b expression. The <b>Intercept</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in significantly lower HSR and CD 42 b expression compared to controls on day 7, with no significant changes in CD 62 P, Δψm, or phosphatidylserine exposure. GPIIbIIIa expression was significantly increased in Intercept-treated platelets throughout the storage period. The agonist-induced aggregation response was highly dependent on the type and concentration of agonist used, indicating a minor effect of the <b>Intercept</b> <b>treatment.</b> The CAD and UV steps alone had a negligible effect on platelet aggregation. DISCUSSION: The <b>Intercept</b> <b>treatment</b> moderately affects platelet function in vitro. CAD and UV illumination alone make negligible contributions to the changes in aggregation observed in Intercept-treated PC...|$|R

At present, there is no established quality control assay that assesses the completeness of the <b>treatment.</b> As <b>INTERCEPT</b> is a photochemical treatment known to generate reactive oxygen species we sought to use the antioxidant power (AOP) of the blood product as a marker of treatment execution. In this perspective, we evaluated an electrochemically based miniaturized system, the EDEL technology, for measuring the AOP in both platelet concentrates (PCs) and plasma. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Aliquots were withdrawn from PCs or plasma units before and after <b>INTERCEPT</b> <b>treatment</b> and a few microliters were directly deposited into the EDEL sensor for the AOP measurement. The result is expressed in EDEL, an arbitrary unit (micromolar equivalent of ascorbic acid). RESULTS: The <b>INTERCEPT</b> <b>treatment</b> resulted in a significant decrease of the AOP. An AOP threshold of 66. 5, 89. 0, 59. 8, and 131. 5 EDEL was determined for apheresis PCs collected from female and male donors, buffy coat PCs, and plasma units, respectively. Below the threshold value, <b>INTERCEPT</b> <b>treatment</b> is considered to be executed. Additionally, we showed that the presence of the photosensitizer in combination with the ultraviolet A illumination is required to observe the AOP decrease. CONCLUSION: The measurement of the AOP of PCs and plasma units can be used to document the completeness of the <b>INTERCEPT</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|R

40|$|Pathogen {{reduction}} (PR) {{systems for}} platelets, based on chemically induced cross-linking and inactivation of nucleic acids, potentially prevent transfusion transmission of infectious agents, but can increase clinically significant bleeding in some clinical studies. Here, we documented {{the effects of}} PR systems on microRNA and mRNA levels of platelets stored in the blood bank, and assessed their impact on platelet activation and function. Unlike platelets subjected to gamma irradiation or stored in additive solution, platelets treated with Intercept (amotosalen +ultraviolet-A [UVA] light) exhibited significantly reduced levels of 6 of the 11 microRNAs, and 2 of the 3 anti-apoptotic mRNAs (Bcl-xl and Clusterin) that we monitored, compared with platelets stored in plasma. Mirasol (riboflavin +UVB light) treatment of platelets did not produce these effects. PR neither affected platelet microRNA synthesis or function nor induced cross-linking of microRNA-sized endogenous platelet RNA species. However, {{the reduction in the}} platelet microRNA levels induced by Intercept correlated with the platelet activation (p 50. 05) and an impaired platelet aggregation response to ADP (p 50. 05).

The technique uses short shaped pulses of sound propagated down a progressive wave tube containing the sample duct. The peak pressure level output of the treated duct is compared with the peak pressure level output of a substituted reference duct.

We used a sensitive method that assessed glomerular filtration rate (GFR), effective renal plasma flow (ERPF), and indicators of tubular and glomerular damage. Methods: A group of 24 patients with either non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) stage IIIb/IV or small-cell lung cancer (SCLC), limited disease (]LD) or extensive disease (ED), treated with JM 216 were studied. All patients had no prior chemotherapy, a performance score < 2, a life expectancy of more than 3 months and normal liver, renal and bone marrow functions before treatment. All patients received oral JM 216 120 mg/m(2) per day for 5 consecutive days, repeated every 21 days with a maximum of six cycles. In six SCLC patients the dose was escalated to 140 mg/m 2 per day after the first cycle. Prior to treatment, after the first cycle and after the end of treatment renal function was assessed by I- 125 -sodium thalamate and I- 131 -hippurate clearances to determine acute and cumulative changes in GFR and ERPF, respectively. Furthermore, tubular and glomerular damage were assessed by urinary excretion of beta(2) -microglobulin, lactic dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), gamma-glutamyltransferase (GT) and albumin. Results: In 20 evaluable patients no significant acute impairment of renal function was observed. Median (range) GFR, ERPF and filtration fraction (FF) before treatment were 101 ml/min (53 - 164 ml/min), 417 ml/min (227 - 719 ml/min), and 0. 25 (0. 19 - 0. 33), respectively. After the first cycle values were 117 ml/min (71 - 189 ml/min), 418 ml/min (228 - 709 mil min) and 0. 28 (0. 21 - 0. 33), respectively.

Materials and Methods: Female ovariectomized Sprague-Dawley rats were replaced with estradiol (E- 2) and estriol (E- 3) (OVX + E; N = 13) and compared to ovariectomized animals without replacement (OVX; N = 14) and intact controls (CTL, proestrous; N = 13). Passive and active diameters, percent tone, and passive distensibility of pressurized PA were compared. In addition, BBB permeability to Lucifer Yellow, a marker of transcellular transport, was compared in cerebral arteries. Results: Ovariectomy increased myogenic tone in PA, compared to CTL, that was not ameliorated by estrogen <b>treatment.</b> Percent <b>tone</b> at 75 mmHg for CTL vs. OVX and OVX + E was 44 +/- 3 % vs. 51 +/- 1 % and 54 +/- 3 % (P < 0. 01 vs. CTL for both).

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this review is to clarify the role of botulinum toxin {{serotype}} A (BTX-A) {{in the treatment of}} children with cerebral palsy (CP), with a special focus on the lower limb. Background The treatment of spasticity is central in the clinical management of children with CP. BTX-A blocks the release of acetylcholine at the motor end plate, causing a temporary muscular denervation and, in an indirect way, a reduced spasticity. Children with increased tone develop secondary problems over time, such as muscle contractures and bony deformities, which impair their function and which need orthopaedic surgery. However in these younger children, delaying surgery is crucial because the results of early surgical interventions are less predictable and have a higher risk of failure and relapse. As BTX-A <b>treatment</b> reduces <b>tone</b> in a selective way, it allows a better motor control and muscle balance across joints, resulting in an improved range of motion and potential to strengthen antagonist muscles, when started at a young age. The effects are even more obvious when the correct BTX-A application is combined with other conservative therapies, such as physiotherapy, orthotic management and casts. There is now clear evidence that the consequences of persistent increased muscle tone can be limited by applying an integrated multi-level BTX-A treatment approach. Nevertheless, important challenges such as patient selection, defining appropriate individual goals, timing, dosing and dilution, accuracy of injection technique and how to measure outcomes will be questioned. Therefore, ‘‘reflection is more important than injection’’ remains an actual statement. status: publishe...|$|R

(2015), who validated decreased exploratory behaviour and raised photophobia as stress-induced anxiety-like behaviours in Procambarus clarkii, we evaluated the effect of different photoperiods on noble crayfish activity and light/dark preference in an aquatic plus maze. We kept 135 two-summer-old crayfish in a recirculating aquaculture system and exposed them to five different photoperiods: hours light/dark (L:D) 0 : 24, 8 : 16, 12 : 12, 16 : 8 and 24 : 0. All animals had access to brushes and PVC pipes as shelters. After 144 days, the crayfish were submitted to the plus maze test. During a ten minute period, each individual’s location was scored every five seconds. Exploratory behaviour was assessed by quantifying the number of movements between different locations in the maze. Light/dark preference {{was determined by the}} time spent in the dark or lit arms.

We assessed the association between OS and time-to-progression (TTP) or progression-free survival (PFS) in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) studies. A literature search retrieved all randomised controlled trials since 1994 in patients with MBC in which OS and either TTP or PFS were reported. Summary data on trial and patient characteristics were abstracted. Study effect sizes were derived as the ratio of median progression (or survival) times, which approximates the hazard ratio. Effects were centred at zero for regression analyses weighted by sample size. Numerous treatments were represented in 67 studies (17 [*] 081 patients). Modeling showed a positive association between outcomes for progression and survival (R 2 = 0. 30) with a slope of 0. 32 (P< 0. 001) and a non-significant <b>intercept.</b> Thus, a <b>treatment</b> effect on TTP/PFS translated into a concordant effect on OS, but with attenuated effect size.

This Bureau of Mines report examines the coal mine roof damage potential of stimulation treatments. Twenty-two Government-sponsored stimulation treatments have been mined through to determine the effects on the coalbed and roof strata. Vertical fractures in the coalbed were discernible for most treatments and horizontal fractures were present for about half of the stimulations. Sand-propped vertical fractures were usually short in lateral extent. Evidence of stimulation fluid movement could generally be traced beyond the maximum extent of sand-filled fractures when fluorescent paint was added to the treatment fluids. The maximum lateral extent for a sand-filled vertical fracture was 416 ft and a paint-coated vertical fracture extended 630 ft. Horizontal fractures were generally found within bedding planes, most commonly on top of the coalbed. The maximum lateral extent for a horizontal fracture was 265 ft at a coalbed depth of 630 ft. Horizontal fractures have been found to occur as deep as 1, 145 ft.

We hypothesized that the inhibition of enteric glutamate receptors by KynA may influence dysmotility in the gastrointestinal tract. Group 1 of healthy dogs served as the sham-operated control, in group 2, the animals were treated with KynA, while in groups 3 and 4 mechanical colon obstruction was maintained for 7 h. Group 4 was treated with KynA at the onset of ileus. Hemodynamics and motility changes were monitored, and the activities of xanthine oxidoreductase (XOR) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) were determined from tissue samples. Colon obstruction induced a hyperdynamic circulatory reaction, significantly elevated the motility index and increased the mucosal leucocyte accumulation and the XOR activity. The KynA <b>treatment</b> augmented the <b>tone</b> of the colon, permanently decreased the motility index of the giant colonic contractions and reduced the increases in XOR and MPO activities.

Based on robust adventitial ROS generation and effects on MAPK involvement in vascular dysfunction, we hypothesized that adventitia-derived ROS hydrogen peroxide (H(2) O(2)) impairs vascular relaxation through activation of medial smooth muscle p 38 MAPK. By using a novel in vivo model, the adventitial surface of rat carotid arteries was bathed in situ for 90 min with vehicle, angiotensin II (AngII; 500 nM), AngII+H(2) O(2) -scavenger catalase (3, 000 U/ml), AngII+p 38 MAPK inhibitor SB 203580 (10 μM), or AngII+superoxide dismutase (SOD; 150 U/ml). After these in vivo <b>treatments,</b> ex vivo <b>tone</b> measurements on isolated vessels revealed that periadventitial application of AngII impaired both acetylcholine-induced (endothelium-dependent) and sodium nitroprusside-induced (endothelium-independent) relaxations. In vivo coincubation with catalase or SB 203580 significantly improved, but SOD exacerbated AngII-induced impairment of in vitro endothelium-dependent and -independent vascular relaxations. Western blots of vascular media, separated from the adventitia, demonstrated increased medial p 38 MAPK activation and decreased medial phosphatase SHP- 2 activity in AngII-treated vessels.

40|$|Potted two-year-old lemon trees [Citrus limon (L.) Burm. f. ], cv. Verna grafted on {{sour orange}} (C. aurantium L.) rootstock, growing in greenhouse, were {{subjected}} to drought for 33 d. Control plants were daily irrigated at field capacity. Values of sap flow (SF) were compared with transpiration (E) rates measured gravimetrically. The results underlined the robustness and high sensitivity of the compensation heat-pulse technique for estimating transpiration {{on a wide range}} of SF. Good direct correlations between E and SF rates on an instantaneous and daily basis were obtained in both treatments. On a daily basis, a common calibration curve can be used for both irrigation treatments. On an instantaneous basis, changes in SF were matches by similar changes in E in both treatments, although the relationships between these parameters presented different <b>intercepts</b> in each <b>treatment.</b> Sap flow rates were influenced by weather conditions in trees growing in non-limiting soil water conditions. This makes it possible to evaluate the significance of any sap flow measurement in relation to the reference value calculated for the vapour pressure deficit at the time the measurement was taken.

40|$|Objective. The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the {{efficacy}} of the treatment of tinnitus with a phase-shifting pure tone to that of the same <b>tone</b> <b>treatment</b> without phase shifting. Study Design. A double-blind crossover randomized controlled trial. Setting. This study was conducted at the University Medical Center Groningen. Subjects and Methods. Twenty-two patients with predominantly tonal tinnitus underwent both intervention and control treatments. Each treatment consisted of three 30 -minute sessions in 1 week. The control treatment was identical to the intervention treatment, except that the stimulus was a pure tone without phase shifting. Questionnaires, tinnitus loudness match, and annoyance and loudness ratings were used to measure treatment effects. Results. Pure-tone treatment and phase-shift treatment had no significant effect on tinnitus according to questionnaires (Tinnitus Handicap Index, Tinnitus Reaction Questionnaire, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale, and Maastricht Questionnaire), audiological matching procedures, and loudness and annoyance ratings of tinnitus. Furthermore, phase-shift treatment showed no additional significant improvement in comparison with pure-tone treatment. Changes in questionnaire scores due to pure-tone and the phase-shift treatment were correlated. Conclusion. On average across the group, both treatments failed to demonstrate a significant effect. Both treatments were beneficial for some patients. However, a positive effect was not demonstrated that could be attributed to the periodic shifting of the phase of the stimulus tone...|$|R
40|$|Oral Session 8 This paper {{looks into}} how {{linguistic}} tones {{can be understood}} as musical tones. It provides a demonstration of the relationship between linguistic tone and musical intervals (MIs), which is especially relevant for Chinese languages since they mostly have relatively complex tonal systems, with more than a two-way tonal distinction, and contour tones. It tests whether MI gives any insight into the human language use of tone. Tones in the Cantonese spoken in Hong Kong (HKC) are used as a testing case. Six HKC speakers balanced for biological gender are selected for this project. The fundamental frequencies of the tones traditionally classified in the same tonal category are extracted with Praat, then time-normalized across syllables at 10 % interval points of the rhymes. The mean values of the interval points of two relatively level tones are expressed in terms of ratio which is then used to match with the closest MI on the musical scale. A compatible <b>treatment</b> of contour <b>tones</b> is provided for the two rising tones in HKC. Through demonstrating that MI is a viable way to interpret linguistic tone on a musical scale, it is found that contour tones can be compatible with the analysis of the relatively level tones. Also, MIs can possibly serve as a referential indicator of tone merger. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Models that {{simulate}} {{the effects of}} water stress on crop yield can be valuable tools in irrigation. We evaluated the crop growth simulation model EPICphase and the model CROPWAT {{on their ability to}} simulate maize (Zea mays L.) grain yield reduction caused by water stress under semiarid conditions. The simulation of evapotranspiration (ET), harvest index (HI), leaf area index (LAI), and final biomass was also evaluated. Data from three field experiments were used to test the models. In one sprinkler-irrigated experiment, different water amounts (0 – 592 mm) were applied, producing a continuous water deficit. The other two experiments were flood-irrigated and water stress was imposed at given development stages of maize. EPICphase simulated the ET with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 40 mm. The regression of the EPICphase simulated vs. measured values of HI and yield had intercepts that were not significantly different from 0 and slopes not different from 1. EPICphase overestimated the biomass in the more water-stressed <b>treatments</b> (<b>intercept</b> of simulated vs. measured values = 5. 25 t ha- 1) due to overestimation of LAI. Modifications of EPICphase relative to the effect of water stress on LAI growth and on the light extinction coefficient improved the simulations of LAI, biomass, HI, and yield. CROPWAT calculated maize grain yield with a RMSE of 14 % but overestimated ET in the flood-irrigated treatments. Better simulation of ET by EPICphase makes this model more consistent for calculating yield reduction due to water stress. This work was supported by the CICYT (HID 96 - 1380 -C 02 - 02).

50|$|The work {{reflects}} {{the scope of}} Rix Nicholas's abilities and ambitions, as she created a painting specifically {{with the intention of}} having it hung at the Paris Salon. When the work was displayed in Sydney in 1927, it grabbed The Sydney Morning Herald critic's attention: For combination of grace, dramatic strength, and clearness in technique this picture would be difficult to surpass. There is nothing finicky about it; it tells its story with vivid directness. As a background to the figure Mrs. Rix Nicholas has set a piece of antique tapestry, so that the trees on either side lean in arch-wise over the head, the face and shoulders stand out clearly against an expanse of sky, and behind the body and limbs extends a countryside full of towers and rivers and trees. The quaint conventionality of this background accords exactly with the late eighteenth-century costume, all sprigged with roses and heliotrope; and the whole mass of detail harmonies sic perfectly with the type of the model's face. It is a cold, selfish face. The artist has brought out with revealing strokes an expression of vindictive malice which is for the moment resting there; and the hands, the fingers of one grasped tightly by the other, give a clear indication of nervous tension within. The <b>treatment</b> of flesh <b>tones</b> and the general arrangemet, drawing attention gently but not too obtrusively to the columbines scattered on the polished floor—those are excellent.|$|R
40|$|Yan Li, Leonidas N Carayannopoulos, Michael Thomas, Maria Palmisano, Simon Zhou Translational Development and Clinical Pharmacology, Celgene Corporation, Summit, NJ, USA Abstract: CC- 122 {{hydrochloride}} {{is a novel}} pleiotropic pathway modifier {{compound that}} binds cereblon, a substrate receptor of the Cullin 4 RING E 3 ubiquitin ligase complex. CC- 122 has multiple activities including modulation of immune cells, antiproliferative activity of multiple myeloma and lymphoma cells, and antiangiogenic activity. CC- 122 is being developed as an oncology treatment for hematologic malignancies and advanced solid tumors. Cardiovascular and vital sign assessments of CC- 122 have been conducted in hERG assays in vitro and in a 28 -day good laboratory practice monkey study with negative signals. To assess the potential concentration–QTc relationship in humans and to ascertain or exclude a small QT effect by CC- 122, a plasma concentration exposure- and ΔQTcF-response model of CC- 122 was developed. Intensive CC- 122 concentration and paired triplicate electrocardiogram data from a single ascending dose study {{were included in the}} analysis. The parameters included in the final linear exposure-response model are <b>intercept,</b> slope, and <b>treatment</b> effect. The slope estimate of 0. 0201 with 90 % CI of (0. 009, 0. 035) indicates a weak relationship between ΔQTcF and CC- 122 concentration. The upper bounds of the 90 % CI of the model-predicted ΔΔQTcF effect at Cmax from the 4  mg clinical dose and the supratherapeutic dose of 15  mg (1. 18  ms and 8. 76  ms, respectively) are < 10  ms threshold, suggesting that the risk of CC- 122 QT prolongation effect at the relevant therapeutic dose range from 1  mg to 4  mg is low.

5000|$|The {{boundaries}} {{between the three}} types of segmental scripts are not always clear-cut. For example, Sorani Kurdish is written in the Arabic script, which is normally an abjad. However, in Kurdish, writing the vowels is mandatory, and full letters are used, so the script is a true alphabet. Other languages may use a Semitic abjad with mandatory vowel diacritics, effectively making them abugidas. On the other hand, the Phagspa script of the Mongol Empire was based closely on the Tibetan abugida, but all vowel marks were written after the preceding consonant rather than as diacritic marks. Although short a was not written, as in the Indic abugidas, one could argue that the linear arrangement made this a true alphabet. Conversely, the vowel marks of the Tigrinya abugida and the Amharic abugida (ironically, the original source of the term [...] "abugida") have been so completely assimilated into their consonants that the modifications are no longer systematic and have to be learned as a syllabary rather than as a segmental script. Even more extreme, the Pahlavi abjad eventually became logographic. (See below.)Thus the primary classification of alphabets reflects how they treat vowels. For tonal languages, further classification can be based on their <b>treatment</b> of <b>tone,</b> though names do not yet exist to distinguish the various types. Some alphabets disregard tone entirely, especially when it does not carry a heavy functional load, as in Somali and many other languages of Africa and the Americas. Such scripts are to tone what abjads are to vowels. Most commonly, tones are indicated with diacritics, the way vowels are treated in abugidas. This is the case for Vietnamese (a true alphabet) and Thai (an abugida). In Thai, tone is determined primarily by the choice of consonant, with diacritics for disambiguation. In the Pollard script, an abugida, vowels are indicated by diacritics, but the placement of the diacritic relative to the consonant is modified to indicate the tone. More rarely, a script may have separate letters for tones, as is the case for Hmong and Zhuang. For most of these scripts, regardless of whether letters or diacritics are used, the most common tone is not marked, just as the most common vowel is not marked in Indic abugidas; in Zhuyin not only is one of the tones unmarked, but there is a diacritic to indicate lack of tone, like the virama of Indic.|$|R
40|$|Background aims. Dermatan sulfate (DS), an {{anticoagulant}} and antithrombotic glycosaminoglycan, {{also has}} anti-inflammatory activity. In this study, we investigated {{the effect of}} DS treatment in {{the presence or absence}} of bone marrow mononuclear cells (MNCs) or endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) in the vascular response to carotid artery lesion in C 57 BL 6 mice. Methods. Thrombus formation, the expression of adhesion molecules and factors involved in vascular remodeling, inflammation or vascular tone were analyzed by histologic examination, Western blotting and enzyme-linked immunoassay 1 and 3 days after vascular injury. Results. DS injections prevented thrombus formation and decreased P-selectin expression after 3 days of the injury. DS treatment also increased plasma SDF- 1 levels but failed to rescue endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) expression, which is responsible for vascular <b>tone.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with MNCs alone failed to prevent thrombus formation 1 day after injury and increased intercellular adhesion molecule- 1 expression, likely because of the inflammatory nature of these cells. Treatment with EPCs with DS was the most efficient among all therapies studied. Dual administration of EPCs and DS promoted an increase in the expression of adhesion molecules and, at the same time, induced a higher expression of eNOS at the injury site. Furthermore, it stimulated an elevated number of EPCs to migrate and adhere to the vascular wall. Discussion. Simultaneous treatment with EPCs and DS increased the expression of adhesion molecules, prevented thrombosis, rescued the expression of eNOS and increased migration of EPCs to the site of injury, thereby affecting thrombus remodeling and inflammation and can be involved in vessel hemostasis...|$|R
