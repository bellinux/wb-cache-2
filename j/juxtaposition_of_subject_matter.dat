5000|$|The Ultimate Alphabet (...) is {{a best-selling}} book by Mike Wilks. It is a {{collection}} of 26 paintings, each depicting a collection of objects starting with a particular letter of the alphabet. It was published in 1986 as a competition with a £10 000 prize, closing in 1988. Unlike children's alphabet books, it contains unusual words, and is extremely intricately painted, with the paintings in a realistic style, but rendered surrealistic by the strange <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter.</b> Wilks himself appears at least once in every painting, as does his trademark snail. Some of Wilks's appearances are less prominent than others; the hardest to spot is in the [...] "W" [...] painting, where he appears (representing, of course [...] "Wilks") in a tiny cameo on a reproduction of the cover of his earlier book Weather Works.|$|E

He retains an interest in decayed textures and unusual <b>juxtapositions</b> <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> as well as [...] "empty spaces, desolation, and loneliness". His documentary series shot in Angkor Wat and Siem Reap deals strongly with the human condition through portraits and atmospheric images of vacant rooms and landscapes and details of possessions revealing how people live.|$|R
500|$|The Daddies {{have often}} been criticized for their seeming <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> lurid <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and profanity with jazz and swing music, though Perry has boldly defended the band's predilection towards [...] "darker" [...] lyricism and visuals, calling to {{attention}} {{his interest in the}} era's film noir and avant-garde artistic movements. A prominent example of this includes the two music videos for the Daddies' hit single [...] "Zoot Suit Riot", which – in addition to being written about the 1943 race riots – both featured pervasive surrealist imagery inspired by the films of Luis Buñuel, specifically his 1929 short Un Chien Andalou. [...] "We wanted to be darker, weirder and stranger", Perry stated in a 2012 interview, [...] "and unfortunately, with other [...] bands it was 'Back then everyone dressed nice and was nice'. That's not true. You don't know anything about that era at all".|$|R
40|$|The sketch {{discusses}} the "relations and interdependencies of impossibilities" connecting the discursive poetry of Bieńkowski with the lyrical poetics of Leśmian. This formula, coined {{by the author}} of "Sprawy wyobraźni," perfectly expresses these kind of references that exceed just a simple <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> similarities in <b>subject</b> <b>matters</b> or poetical figures. In terms of this plane, there seem to be are more differences between the two poems than conceivable similarities. However, within the plane of creative philosophy, the awareness of the language status in modern poetry, the abiding concept of reality and the attitude towards civilizational and social transformations, the similarities are particularly striking. The avant-garde poet does not shun from employing early modernist individualistic, idealistic, regressive and aesthetic (formalistic) tendencies so characteristic for Leśmian. If Przyboś, as Łapiński put it, "rehabilitated" Leśmian’s programme, Bieńkowski makes the Przyboś’ programme back again more like Leśmian-like, creating a programme not so much avant-garde in character but rather a one that relates to decadent aspirations of modernism in its narrowest sense. Not surprisingly then, he makes the lyrics of the author of Łąka his particular tertium comparationis of the phenomena in Polish postwar poetry, linguistic poetry in particular. This way, unusual power of modernity of Leśmian poetry is testified and well proven...|$|R
40|$|What, in {{the context}} of law, does 2 ̆ 2 {{reasoning}} from literature 2 ̆ 2 mean? Depending on the inflection, the phrase might suggest that literature can set in motion a process of reasoning - rather than imagining, or emoting, or simply appreciating. Although this reasoning could take a number of forms - analogizing, distinguishing, and extrapolating, among others-it would, presumably, have consequences for law. With another emphasis, the expression might imply that the lawyer or legal scholar should bring her ordinary tools of analysis to bear in relation to another object, that of literature. Taking the activity of reasoning as a paradigmatic feature of legal practice, 2 ̆ 2 reasoning from literature 2 ̆ 2 would then indicate the application of the lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s method outside its usual field of inquiry. In both cases, the phrase proposes a <b>juxtaposition</b> <b>of</b> approach with <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> that counters everyday conceptions {{of the relationship between the}} fields of law and of literature. In both cases too, the phrase gives the impression that reasoning from literature might have consequences for law. The associations upon which this interpretation rests might themselves be subject to critique: are scholars in the humanities not always 2 ̆ 2 reasoning from literature, 2 ̆ 2 and do legal materials themselves not often employ rhetoric in a way that contravenes reason? Along these lines, Peter Brooks 2 ̆ 7 s contribution to the Symposium elegantly turns the logic of the assignment around, indicating how techniques of interpretive reasoning derived from literature can serve as a resource for identifying illogic in law. Rather than questioning the terms of the categories, this Article instead investigates whose reasoning is involved in the reference to reasoning from literature. The dynamics of reasoning from literature, I contend, vary according to historical period, and they are significantly affected by the composition of the audiences of both literature and law...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 The study {{investigated}} the impact of Thai preservice middle school mathematics teachers' knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> students' conceptions of division of rational numbers {{with respect to their}} classroom practices in a teaching environment controlled by a required national curriculum. Four preservice teachers were selected with different knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> students' conceptions of division of rational numbers: high knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and high knowledge of students' conceptions, high knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and low knowledge of students' conceptions, low knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and high knowledge of students' conceptions, and low knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and low knowledge of students' conceptions. Each preservice teacher was observed three weeks, each class day during the teaching of units on division of decimals, representing fractions as decimals, and division of fractions. Formal interviews were conducted with each of the four preservice teachers prior to and after teaching each unit. Informal interviews were conducted prior to and after teaching each lesson. Materials used in the normal teaching of the class were collected. Interviews with the preservice teachers' mentors were conducted before and after each unit. The mentors were interviewed daily before or after the instruction. Interviews with supervisors were conducted each time they supervised the preservice teachers. Results showed that all preservice teachers planned and taught division of rational numbers procedurally following an algorithmically-based national curriculum. The preservice teachers with higher <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge used multiple examples. They could make up examples when the students asked questions. In contrast, the lower <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> knowledge preservice teachers rarely created new examples while they were teaching. The high knowledge of students' conceptions preservice teachers used their knowledge of students' conceptions throughout the lessons more often than the low knowledge of students' conceptions preservice teachers. After teaching the lessons, they all gained knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> students' conceptions of division of rational numbers. The depth <b>of</b> knowledge <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and <b>of</b> students' conceptions of division of rational numbers is as essential for preservice middle school mathematics teachers' teaching in a nonvoluntary curriculum as it is in a voluntary curriculum...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this master thesis {{is to provide a}} view into the development <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and territorial jurisdiction in administrative infraction proceedings as a part of administrative punishment law. The thesis handles this issue in its entirety, that is form its origins up to considerations on the future legal regulation, and, furthermore, analyses the issue into more depth. The thesis relies mainly on legal regulation and relevant literature as its primary sources and is divided into three chapters. The first chapter, firstly, deals with the development <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and territorial jurisdiction in the 18 th and 19 th century and focuses on the formation of the concept of infraction itself, its division into the categories of administrative and judicial infraction and the gradual obsolescence of the phenomenon of judicial infraction. Secondly, it handles the transfer <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> jurisdiction in "judicial" infraction proceedings from administrative authorities to courts and, thirdly, defines the three bodies authorized to conduct administrative infraction proceedings. In the second chapter, the issue <b>of</b> <b>subject</b> <b>matter</b> and territorial jurisdiction in the 20 th century is dealt with. Its primary aim is to describe several unsuccessful legislative proposals in the area of [...] ...|$|R
