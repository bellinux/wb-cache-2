50|$|<b>Dectaflur</b> (INN) is a fluoride-containing {{substance}} {{used for}} the prevention and treatment of dental caries, sensitive teeth, and the refluoridation of damaged tooth enamel, typically in combination with olaflur.|$|E
50|$|Like other fluorides, <b>dectaflur</b> is toxic when overdosed over an {{extended}} period of time. Especially in children, before the development of the permanent teeth, overdosage can lead to dental fluorosis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Dectaflur</b> {{consists}} of oleyl amine (the amine corresponding to oleyl alcohol) and hydrofluoric acid. Oleyl amine with its long lipophilic hydrocarbon chain has surfactant properties. It forms a film layer {{on the surface}} of teeth, which facilitates incorporation of fluoride into the top layers of the enamel, reaching a depth of only a few nanometers. The precise mechanism of action is unknown.|$|E
50|$|Olaflur (INN, or amine {{fluoride}} 297) is a fluoride-containing {{substance that}} is an ingredient of toothpastes and solutions {{for the prevention of}} dental caries. It has been in use since 1966. Especially in combination with <b>dectaflur,</b> it is also used in the form of gels for the treatment of early stages of caries, sensitive teeth, and by dentists for the refluoridation of damaged tooth enamel.|$|E
40|$|Enolase and ATPase are {{sensitive}} to fluoride. It is unclear whether this sensitivity differs for F-sensitive and F-resistant cells or for different types of fluoride. Permeabilized cells of the fluoride-sensitive strain Streptococcus mutans C 180 - 2 and its fluoride-resistant mutant strain C 180 - 2 FR were preincubated at pH 7 or 4 with NaF, the amine fluorides Olaflur and <b>Dectaflur</b> and amine chloride controls. After preincubations, enolase and ATPase activities of the cells were assessed. Enolase activity was more inhibited after preincubation at pH 7 with NaF than with Olaflur. Amine chloride stimulated, although not with statistical significance, the enolase activity of both strains. After preincubation at pH 4 the enolases were strongly inactivated, but the fluoride-resistant strain's enolase to a lesser extent. The results suggested that amine acts to protect enolase activity against the detrimental low pH effect. Gene sequencing showed that the enolase genes of the fluoride-resistant and fluoride-sensitive strain were identical. ATPase activity was not reduced after NaF preincubation at either pH 7 or pH 4. The amine fluorides and their chloride controls in the preincubation mixture reduced the ATPase activity significantly at both pH values. In conclusion, our results showed that preincubation with amine fluoride did not inhibit enolase activity more effectively than NaF. The amine part of the molecule may protect enolase activity against preincubations at low pH. ATPase activity was not inhibited by NaF preincubation but was significantly inhibited after preincubation with amine fluorides and amine chlorides...|$|E
