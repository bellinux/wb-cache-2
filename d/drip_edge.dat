25|$|Architectural copper is, however, {{susceptible}} to corrosive attack under certain conditions. Oxidizing acids, oxidizing heavy-metal salts, alkalis, sulfur and nitrogen oxides, ammonia, and some sulfur and ammonium compounds can expedite copper corrosion. Precipitation {{in areas with}} a pH less than 5.5 may corrode copper, possibly before a patina or protective oxide film has the time to form. Acidic precipitation, known as acid rain, is due to emissions from fossil fuel combustion, chemical manufacturing, or other processes that release sulfur and nitrogen oxides into the atmosphere. Erosion corrosion may occur when acidic water from a non-copper roof that does not neutralise the acidity, such as tile, slate, wood, or asphalt, falls on a small area of copper. Line corrosion can occur if the <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> of an inert roofing material rests directly on copper. A solution to this may be to raise the lower edge of the shingles with a cant strip, or to provide a replaceable reinforcing strip between the shingles and the copper. Proper water-shedding design and detailing, which reduces the dwell time of acidic water on metal surfaces, can prevent the majority of atmospheric corrosion problems.|$|E
50|$|A water/air {{resistant}} membrane {{is placed}} between the furring and the sheathing to prevent rain water {{from entering the}} wall structure. The membrane directs water away and toward special <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> flashings which protect {{other parts of the}} building.|$|E
5000|$|In {{classical}} architecture, the fascia is the plain, {{wide band}} {{across the bottom}} of the entablature, directly above the columns. The [...] "guttae" [...] or <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> was mounted on the fascia in the Doric order, below the triglyph.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{disadvantages}} of copper is its propensity to stain light-colored building materials, such as marble or limestone. Green staining is particularly visible on light-colored surfaces. Lead-coated copper {{can result in}} a black or gray stain that may blend well with lighter building materials. Staining can be reduced by collecting runoff in gutters and directing it away from the building via downspouts or by designing <b>drip</b> <b>edges</b> to help reduce the amount of copper laden moisture that comes into contact with material below. Coating the adjacent surface of the porous material with a clear silicone sealant also reduces staining. Staining may not develop in areas of rapid run-off due to the short dwell time of water on the copper.|$|R
5000|$|It {{is thought}} that the guttae were a skeuomorphic {{representation}} of the pegs used {{in the construction of}} the wooden structures that preceded the familiar Greek architecture in stone. However, they have some functionality, as water <b>drips</b> over the <b>edges,</b> away from the edge of the building.|$|R
60|$|Two {{or three}} men, looking little and black like monkeys, leapt {{over the edge}} as they had done and dropped on to the beach. These came {{ploughing}} down the deep sand, shouting horribly, and strove to wade into the sea at random. The example was followed, and the whole black mass of men began to run and <b>drip</b> over the <b>edge</b> like black treacle.|$|R

The 12 Watt Blackface version {{was introduced in}} 1964 and available until 1967, in 1968 it was changed to the Silverface version with a <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> around the grill cloth. Amps produced {{after the end of}} 1969 saw a change in circuitry, the removal of the <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> and the rectifier was changed from a 5ar4 to a 5u4gb along with a change in bias resistor value, a [...] "boost" [...] pull switch to the volume control pot was added in 1977. In 1980 and 1981 the Silverface version was cosmetically changed back to the Blackface. It was discontinued in 1981.|$|E
50|$|Termite shields {{can be made}} up {{of various}} materials. One type of termite shield is made from various sheet metals {{including}} galvanized steel, terne, copper, or aluminum. The metal is formed to fit between the top of the foundation wall and the bottom of the wood sole plate. The edges of the termite shield are typically hemmed, extended slightly beyond the face of the wall, and turned down to form a <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> which diverts water running down the face of the wall and reduce the movement of subterranean termites from the soil up into the wood framing members. Termite shields will not protect a building from termite activity, but help make termite activity more visible.|$|E
50|$|Geison (γεῖσον - often {{interchangeable}} with somewhat broader term cornice) is {{an architectural}} term of relevance particularly to ancient Greek and Roman buildings, {{as well as}} archaeological publications of the same. The geison {{is the part of}} the entablature that projects outward {{from the top of the}} frieze in the Doric order and from the top of the frieze course (or sometimes architrave) of the Ionic and Corinthian orders; it forms the outer edge of the roof on the sides of a structure with a sloped roof. The upper edge of the exterior often had a <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> formed as a hawksbeak molding to shed water; there were also typically elaborate moldings or other decorative elements, sometimes painted. Above the geison ran the sima. The underside of the geison may be referred to as a soffit. The form of a geison (particularly the Hawksbeak molding of the outer edge) is often used as one element of the argument for the chronology of its building.|$|E
30|$|The {{oil-based}} enamel paints, {{all made}} by Ripolin except one ultramarine blue paint made by Bengaline, another French firm; and Lefranc tube paints {{were applied to}} microscope slides using a fixed-thickness applicator to achieve a uniform film of approximately 100 – 200 microns. For this investigation paint samples were taken from films which had been stored at ambient temperature {{in a variety of}} light conditions (dark storage and ambient indoor light) for approximately 6  years. Additional liquid and dried paint samples were taken directly from paint cans for analysis: when well-sealed, some cans have preserved their content in the liquid phase for almost a century. The examined samples cover a broad range of colors and dates of manufacture. 20 Ripolin paint sample cards (“brochures”, each containing 20 – 86 swatches of paint), which represent the entire color range produced by the company in France and roughly cover the period 1897 – 1950, have been gathered and analysed as reported in an earlier study [19]; several examples are discussed here for comparison with the samples from cans. In total, 31 samples of historic reference paints were analyzed for this study. The paint sample from Kandinsky’s Leichtes 1930 (sample # 1, light blue paint from <b>drip</b> at <b>edge),</b> was provided by the MNAM, Centre Georges Pompidou, Paris [32], and the sample from Picasso’s Pêcheur assis à la casquette, 1946 (sample # 5 from the back: drip of gray/white under “Antibes” in the artist’s writing) by the Musée Picasso, Antibes [7, 39]. The cold-pressed linseed oil used as a reference in the ESI–MS measurements was prepared by Leslie Carlyle as part of the HART (Historically Accurate Reconstructions Techniques) project [5]; linseed stand oil was Winsor and Newton, collection of AIC.|$|R
5000|$|The ca. 720 CE Nihon Shoki writes Kuraokami with kanji as 闇龗 [...] "dark rain-dragon". In the Nihongi version, Izanagi killed Kagutsuchi {{by cutting}} him into three pieces, {{each of which}} became a god: Kuraokami, Kurayamatsumi 闇山祇 [...] "dark {{mountain}} respect", and Kuramitsuha 闇罔象 [...] "dark water-sprit". This mitsuha 罔象 is a variant of mōryō 魍魎 [...] "demon; evil spirit" [...] (written with the [...] "ghost radical" [...] 鬼). Kurayamatsumi is alternately written Takaokami 高靇 [...] "high rain-dragon". Visser (1913:136) says, [...] "This name is explained {{by one of the}} commentators as [...] "the dragon-god residing on the mountains", in distinction from Kura-okami, [...] "the dragon-god of the valleys". At length he drew the ten-span sword with which he was girt, and cut Kagu tsuchi into three pieces, each of which became changed into a God. Moreover, the blood which <b>dripped</b> from the <b>edge</b> of the sword became the multitudinous rocks which are in the bed of the Easy-River of Heaven. This God was the father of Futsu-nushi no Kami. Moreover, the blood which dripped from the hilt-ring of the sword spurted out and became deities, whose names were Mika no Haya-hi no Kami and next Hi no Haya-hi no Kami. This Mika no Haya-hi no Kami was the parent of Take-mika-suchi no Kami. Another version is: [...] "Mika no haya-hi no Mikoto, next Hi no haya-hi no Mikoto, and next Take-mika-tsuchi no Kami. Moreover, the blood which dripped from the point of the sword spurted out and became deities, who were called Iha-saku no Kami, after him Ne-saku no Kami, and next Iha-tsutsu-wo no Mikoto. This Iha-saku no Kami was the father of Futsu-nushi no Kami." [...] One account says: [...] "Iha-tsutsu-wo no Mikoto, and next Iha-tsutsu-me no Mikoto. Moreover, the blood which dripped from the head of the sword spurted out and became deities, who were called Kura o Kami no Kami, next Kura-yamatsumi no Kami, and next Kura-midzu-ha no Kami. (tr. Aston 1896:23) William George Aston (1896:24) footnotes translations for these kami names: Kuraokami [...] "Dark-god", Kurayamatsumi [...] "Dark-mountain-body-god", and Kuramitsuha [...] "Dark-water-goddess". De Visser (1913:136-137) says Kuramitsuha could be translated [...] "Dark-water-snake", [...] "Valley-water-snake", or [...] "Female-water-snake".|$|R

50|$|The {{house is}} a {{hemicycle}} design, measuring approximately 2600 sq ft on a 1.3 acre lot. The Laurent House was Wright's first single-story building to use this design. The lot gently slopes toward the Spring Creek. It is primarily built with red tidewater cypress and Chicago common brick; plans originally called for limestone, but the Laurents rejected the additional cost. It is built on a poured concrete foundation set on crushed rock; {{the top layer of}} concrete was mixed with a red pigment. The house features two large chimneys. The central chimney is above the roofline with a wide copper <b>drip</b> <b>edge.</b> The other chimney is on the end wall of {{the east side of the}} master bedroom. The roof is flat and is made of tar and gravel. The house has deep eaves and a wide fascia. Recessed square lightboxes are found intermittently along the eaves. All windows have cypress frames and are single light. The main entrance is underneath a two-car carport. A 50 ft curved wall of glass faces the northwest. The house has radiant heat from water pipes. The only sub-grade area of the {{house is a}} small maintenance room where devices such as the water heater and water softener are located. Bathrooms are larger than in most Wright designs for improved maneuverability.|$|E

Radovi na palači Skočibučić-Lukaris obavljani su 2006. - 2007. godine. Opis radova donosi se prema pojedinim fazama rada. Opisano je zatečeno stanje građevine, metode, načini rada te materijali korišteni u konzervatorsko-restauratorskim radovima. The {{restoration}} of the Skočibušić-Lukaris Palace façade marked {{the second phase of}} the overall restoraration-conservation works, carried out in Peristil Square, in Split. The interpolation of historically different artistic styles is what makes this phase different from the first one. Certain procedures, such as the thorough documentation of the present condition of the building and the architectural survey, preceded restoration-conservation works. Then, all the impurities of the organic origin were removed by multiple applications of biocidal agent. The remaining organic growths were removed with high-pressured steam. The next step in the restoration- conservation work was the extraction of metal parts from the stone and the removal of cement from the joints. The most significant procedure applied in the course of this work was laser removal of inorganic impurities, dark layers and black crusts. It was for the first time that the laser cleaning technology was used in the removal of the impurities from the stone, in the course of restoration-conservation work in Croatia. Reconstructive interventios were carried out using artificial stone, which, by its properties, colour and dressing, resembled natural stone used previously in the construction of the Peristyle. Further stone-patching procedures were carried out using Brač limestone, identical to the stone used as the original building material. In order to prevent further deterioration of the stone, the desalination and consolidation procedures were carried out, together with the final application of the protective layer. The application of the finishing coat, made of mortar and covered with a protective lead-cap serving as the <b>drip</b> <b>edge,</b> marked the last important step in the restoration-conservation work. After all the work was completed, a bird protection system was installed. The restorationconservation interventions on the plaster were carried out, as well. Historic plaster was thoroughly documented and purified. Complex reconstructive interventions were carried out and a protective coating was applied. That is how {{the second phase of the}} conservation-restoration works in Peristil Square was completed...|$|E
40|$|Using {{data from}} a water-balance {{instrument}} cluster with spatially distributed sensors we determined the magnitude and within-catchment variability of components of the catchmentscale water balance, focusing {{on the relationship of}} seasonal evapotranspiration to changes in snowpack and soil moisture storage. Co-located, continuous snow depth and soil moisture measurements were deployed in a rain-snow transition catchment in the mixed-conifer forest in the Southern Sierra Nevada. At each elevation sensors were placed in the open, under the canopy, and at the <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> on both north- and south-facing slopes. Snow sensors were placed at 27 locations, with soil moisture and temperature sensors placed at depths of 10, 30, 60, and 90 cm beneath the snow sensor. Soils are weakly developed (Inceptisols and Entisols) and formed from decomposed granite with properties that change with elevation. The soil- bedrock interface is hard in upper reaches of the basin (> 2000 m) where glaciers have scoured the parent material approximately 18, 000 yr ago. Below an elevation of 2000 m soils have a paralithic contact (weathered saprolite) that can extend beyond a depth of 1. 5 m, facilitating pathways for deep percolation. Soils are wet and not frozen in winter, and dry out in the weeks following spring snowmelt and rain. Based on data from two snowmelt seasons, it was found that soils dry out following snowmelt at relatively uniform rates; however, the timing of drying at a given site may be offset by up to 4 wk because of heterogeneity in snowmelt at different elevations and aspects. Spring and summer rainfall mainly affected sites in the open, with drying after a rain event being faster than following snowmelt. Water loss rates from soil of 0. 5 to 1. 0 cm d - 1 during the winter and snowmelt season reflect a combination of evapotranspiration and deep drainage, as stream baseflow remains relatively low. About one-third of annual evapotranspiration comes from water storage below the 1 -m depth, that is, below mapped soil. We speculate that much of the deep drainage is stored locally in the deeper regolith during periods of high precipitation, being available for tree transpiration during summer and fall months when shallow soil water storage is limiting. Total annual evapotranspiration for water year 2009 was estimated to be approximately 76 cm. © Soil Science Society of America...|$|E
40|$|Much of the Sierra Nevada {{forests are}} {{overstocked}} {{with too many}} trees, {{are at risk of}} burning in stand-replacing wildfires due to the fuel loading, contain almost complete canopy coverage over the landscape and intercept {{a substantial portion of the}} snowpack, and in need of thinning. New research shows that forest thinning patterns allowing for forest structures comprising of clumps of varying density, single individual trees, and forest gaps are what the historic stands in Sierra Nevada were comprised of. In addition to returning the forest to historic stand structure, forest thinning will also allow for greater amounts of snowpack to reach the forest floor and persist longer into the season before complete meltout. This study set out to see if this new thinning spacing pattern would affect snow accumulation or ablation rates as compared with the current standard even-tree spacing. Data from four snow surveys, distributed light/temperature sensors, hemispherical photographs, and a small distributed network of snow-depth sensors were analyzed from three different forest treatments in the Sierra Nevada. The first treatment consisted of variable thinning, which reduced the stems per acre by 80 %, the basal area per acre by 40 %, and created a heterogeneous forest structure with small gaps and clumps of trees of varying density. The second forest treatment reduced the stems per acre and the basal area per acre stand down to similar levels as the variable thinning, however the residual trees were left to replicate a homogenous, even spacing. An unthinned control provided a comparison to pre-treatment conditions. Snow-survey data showed that approximately 10 - 20 % more snow accumulated in the two thinning treatments than in the control. Differences in snow depth between the two thinning treatments were statistically insignificant. Snow-survey results also indicated that the variable treatments kept snow on the ground longer than the even treatments in the 2013 water year, which had a peak snow water equivalent (SWE) of 17. 9 cm, and melted out at approximately the same time as the control units. In 2014 the peak SWE recorded was only 6. 3 cm, both the variable and even treatments melted out at the same time, and the control units kept a steady snowpack for approximately 1 - 3 days longer. Data from snow-surveys, distributed light/temperature sensors and snow-depth sensors showed that more snow accumulated in the open than at the <b>drip</b> <b>edge</b> and under the forest canopy, and that melt rates are faster in the open than under the canopy. Our data showed that the variable treatment held the snowpack longer and exhibited a slower melt rate than did the even treatments indicating a possibility to retain substantial amounts of snow in the mountains longer if this thinning structure were to be implemented on a landscape level...|$|E
