In this application, the precursors are distributed in the whole human body and the chemical reactions are performed only within cells having specific RNA molecules. This approach allows very specific synthesis within peculiar tissues or within specific cells of the tissue. It is especially a new tool to deliver medications to cancer cells. Additionally biologically active compounds could be delivered to specific cells within humans to promote the targeted cells to divisions. NATC also opens the possibility to treat bacterial diseases.

In <b>eucaryotic</b> cells, new phospholipids are manufactured by enzymes bound to {{the part of the}} endoplasmic reticulum membrane that faces the cytosol. These enzymes, which use free fatty acids as substrates, deposit all newly made phospholipids into the cytosolic half of the bilayer. To enable the membrane as a whole to grow evenly, half of the new phospholipid molecules then have to be transferred to the opposite monolayer. This transfer is catalyzed by enzymes called flippases. In the plasma membrane, flippases transfer specific phospholipids selectively, so that different types become concentrated in each monolayer.|$|E

40|$|The present {{invention}} {{relates to}} processes for inserting DNA into <b>eucaryotic</b> cells, particularly DNA {{which includes a}} gene or genes coding for desired proteinaceous materials for which no selective criteria exist. The insertion of such DNA molecules is accomplished by cotransforming <b>eucaryotic</b> cells with such DNA together with a second DNA which corresponds to a gene coding for a selectable marker. This invention also concerns processes for producing proteinaceous materials such as insulin, interferon protein, growth hormone and the like which involve cotransforming <b>eucaryotic</b> cells with DNA which codes for these proteinaceous materials, growing the cotransformed cells for production of the proteinaceous material and recovering the proteinaceous material so produced. The invention further relates to processes for inserting into <b>eucaryotic</b> cells a multiplicity of DNA molecules which includes genes coding for desired proteinaceous materials. The insertion of multiple copies of desired genes is accomplished by cotransformation with the desired genes and with amplifiable genes for a dominant selectable marker {{in the presence of}} successively higher amounts of an inhibitor. Alternatively, the insertion of multiple copies of desired genes is accomplished by transformation using DNA molecules formed by ligating a DNA molecule including the desired gene to a DNA molecule which includes an amplifiable gene coding for a dominant selectable phenotype such as a gene associated with resistance to a drug in the presence of successively higher amounts of an agent such as a drug against which the gene confers resistance so that only those <b>eucaryotic</b> cells into which multiple copies of the amplifiable gene have been inserted survive. <b>Eucaryotic</b> cells into which multiple copies of the amplifiable gene have been inserted additionally include multiple copies of the desired gene and may be used to produce multiple copies of proteinaceous molecules.

40|$|Immunochemical {{studies using}} {{polyclonal}} antisera prepared individually against highly purified cytosolic and chloroplast spinach leaf (Spinacia oleracea) fructose bisphosphate aldolases showed significant cross reaction between both forms of spinach aldolase and their heterologous antisera. The individual cross reactions were {{estimated to be}} approximately 50 % in both cases under conditions of antibody saturation using a highly sensitive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. In contrast, the class I procaryotic aldolase from Mycobacterium smegmatis and the class II aldolase from yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) did not cross-react with either type of antiserum. The 29 residue long amino-terminal amino acid sequences of the procaryotic M. smegmatis and the spinach chloroplast aldolases were determined. Comparisons of these sequences {{with those of other}} aldolases showed that the amino-terminal primary structure of the chloroplast aldolase is much more similar to the amino-terminal structures of class I cytosolic <b>eucaryotic</b> aldolases than it is to the corresponding region of the M. smegmatis enzyme, especially in that region which forms the first “beta sheet” in the secondary structure of the <b>eucaryotic</b> aldolases. Moreover, results of a systematic comparison of the amino acid compositions of a number of diverse <b>eucaryotic</b> and procaryotic fructose bisphosphate aldolases further suggest that the chloroplast aldolase belongs to the <b>eucaryotic</b> rather than the procaryotic “family” of class I aldolases...|$|E
