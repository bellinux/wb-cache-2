As he is being shown out, Frazier attacks Russell, but is restrained by another of the robbers.

However, this is disproven when the robbers execute one of the hostages.|$|E
5|$|After {{the initial}} reports, Donaghy stayed at his home, {{before moving to}} a secure {{location}} to avoid the media scrutiny. He surrendered on August 15, 2007, and pleaded guilty to two felony charges of conspiracy. He told <b>judges</b> <b>that</b> he had used coded language to tip others about players' physical condition and player/referee relations, and he specifically admitted to passing information about two games during the 2006–07 season. In total, he received $30,000 to pass inside information to the bookies. Donaghy also {{admitted that he had}} a severe gambling addiction, and was on medication to address it. He was released on a $250,000 bond.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is that judges, who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove <b>judges</b> <b>that</b> stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E
40|$|Can’t one truly <b>judge</b> <b>that</b> one is <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly <b>judge</b> <b>that</b> one is <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness <b>that</b> one is <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> one is <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that one is now <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever one is <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p, one has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> one is <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> one is <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R
50|$|Combined {{with the}} third {{fundamental}} claim of Brentano, the idea that all judgments are either positive (<b>judging</b> <b>that</b> A exists) or negative (<b>judging</b> <b>that</b> A does not exist), we have a complete picture of Brentano’s theory of judgment. So, imagine that you doubt whether midgets exist. At that point you have a presentation of midgets in your mind. When you <b>judge</b> <b>that</b> midgets do not exist, then you are <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> the presentation you have does not present something that exists. You {{do not have to}} utter that in words or otherwise predicate that judgment. The whole judgment takes place in the denial (or approval) of the existence of the presentation you have.|$|R

A new commission <b>judged</b> <b>that</b> Ponta de São Jorge was too obscure, and <b>judged</b> <b>that</b> a more convenient site would be Ponta das Contendas. The revised project substituted the second-order lantern for a fifth-order light, with six clarions.|$|R
5|$|As a captain, Jardine {{inspired}} great loyalty in his players, even if {{they did}} not approve of his tactics. Christopher Douglas <b>judges</b> <b>that</b> Jardine did very well to keep the team united and loyal on the Bodyline tour. He points out that team spirit was always excellent and the players showed great determination and resolve. Jardine particularly impressed Yorkshiremen who played under him, as they believed he thought about cricket in a similar way to their county colleagues. He became close to Herbert Sutcliffe during the Bodyline tour, even though Sutcliffe was sceptical about Jardine on the previous Australian tour in 1928–29. Hedley Verity was impressed by Jardine's tactical understanding and named his younger son Douglas after the captain. Bill Bowes expressed approval of his leadership after initial misgivings, and went on to call him England's greatest captain. Nevertheless, some players such as Arthur Mitchell who played under Jardine believed he was intolerant and unsupportive of players of lesser talent, expecting everyone to perform at world-class standards.|$|E
5|$|Chicago-area Latino groups contested the {{legislative}} district {{map of the}} Illinois General Assembly in United States federal court. The panel of <b>judges</b> <b>that</b> decided the case ordered a new map that gave Hispanics a majority in two Illinois House of Representatives districts in Chicago, the 9th, which is predominantly Puerto Rican, and the 20th, which is predominantly Mexican American. In 1982, Nedza sponsored Berrios, at the time chief clerk to Cook County Board of (Tax) Appeals Commissioner Harry Semrow, in the 9th district. Berrios {{was one of three}} candidates who filed nominating petitions to run in the Democratic primary, but Berrios ran unopposed when the petitions of the other two candidates were successfully challenged. Republicans fielded no candidate in their primary, so Berrios ran unopposed in the general election, and at the age of 30 became the first Hispanic American to serve in the Illinois General Assembly. Berrios ran for re-election unopposed in the Fall 1986 general election. He won re-election twice, serving three two-year terms.|$|E

25|$|In Hutchins v. District of Columbia (1999) (en banc), Garland {{agreed with}} four other D.C.

He joined parts of a plurality opinion written by Judge Laurence Silberman that upheld the juvenile curfew under intermediate scrutiny and a vagueness challenge.

25|$|Unlike {{most other}} countries, the Film Censors Office have little {{involvement}} in video game censorship.

25|$|The {{extensive}} witness testimony {{convinced the}} <b>judges</b> <b>that</b> there were adequate grounds for establishing {{the guilt of}} the accused. After Rais admitted to the charges on 21 October, the court canceled a plan to torture him into confessing. Peasants of the neighboring villages had earlier begun to make accusations that their children had entered Gilles' castle begging for food and had never been seen again. The transcript, which included testimony from the parents {{of many of these}} missing children as well as graphic descriptions of the murders provided by Gilles' accomplices, was said to be so lurid that the judges ordered the worst portions to be stricken from the record.|$|E
