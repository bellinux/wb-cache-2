40|$|Background/Aim. Esophageal variceal {{bleeding}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequent and gravest complications of liver cirrhosis, directly life-threatening. By monitoring certain clinical and laboratory <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency</b> parameters (Child-Pugh score), it is possible to determine prognosis in patients who are bleeding and evaluate further therapy. Recently, the Model for the End-Stage Liver Disease (MELD) has been proposed as a tool to predict mortality risk in cirrhotic patients. The aim of the study was to evaluate survival prognosis of cirrhotic patients by the MELD and Child-Pugh scores and to analyze the MELD score prognostic value in patients with both liver cirrhosis and variceal bleeding. Methods. We retrospectively evaluated the survival rate of a group of 100 cirrhotic patients of a median age of 57 years. The Child-Pugh score was calculated and the MELD score was computed according to the original formula for each patient. We also analyzed clinical and laboratory <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency</b> parameters in order to examine their connection with a 15 -month survival. The MELD values were correlated with the Child-Pugh scores. The Student's t-test was used for statistical analysis. Results. Twenty-two patients died within 15 -months follow-up. Age and gender did not affect survival rate. The Child- Pugh and MELD scores, as well as ascites and encephalopathy significantly differed between the patients who survived and those who died (p < 0. 0001). The International Normalized Ratio (INR) values, serum creatinine and bilirubin were significantly higher, and albumin significantly lower in the patients who died (p < 0. 0001). The MELD score was significantly higher in the group of patients who died due to esophageal variceal bleeding (p < 0. 0001). Conclusion. In cirrhotic patients the MELD score is an excellent survival predictor at least as well as the Child-Pugh score. Increase in the MELD score is associated with decrease in residual liver function. In the group of patients with liver cirrhosis and esophageal variceal bleeding, the MELD score identifies those with a higher intrahospital mortality risk...|$|E
40|$|Regorafenib is a multikinase {{inhibitor}} {{which showed}} benefits in pretreated metastatic colorectal cancer patients. Hepatotoxicity {{has been described}} as a frequent side effect.

40|$|The Doberman {{hepatitis}} {{was described}} {{for the first}} time by Johnson in 1982. It mainly concerns females and the animal average age is around four and a half years. At the beginning, the clinical signs may be mild or absent. When the symptoms appear, it comes with a liver failure shown by anorexia, weight loss, polydipsia, polyuria, gastrointestinal signs and ascites. Most of dogs are presented in advanced stage sometimes with hepatic encephalopathy signs. Laboratory findings show a <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency</b> and impaired biliary excretion. The histologic findings are typical of CAH with copper accumulation and cholestasis. The diagnosis is obtained thanks to histopathologic features. The prognosis is often poor and the surviving time depend of the stage of the presentation. The treatment is based on corticosteroid drug and copper chelator with a low copper diet. Pathogenesis is poorly understood; an immune response must be implicated. The significance of the increased hepatic copper concentration has not been determined.

40|$|In {{economically}} developed countries, cirrhosis {{is one of}} the six leading {{causes of}} death at the age of 35 – 60 years and ranges from 14 to 30 cases per 100000 population. In the world 40 million people die of cirrhosis each year. At 6 % {{of the population of the}} Russian Federation there is a diabetes mellitus. The combination of diabetes mellitus in patients with cirrhosis of the liver is a common comorbid pathology. Diabetes mellitusis a risk factor for the development of liver cirrhosis, and the incidence of combination of both diseases is quite high, although the frequency of occurrence varies. About 80 % of patients with LC may have impaired glucose metabolism, and 30 % have diabetes mellitus. Prospective studies have shown that diabetes is associated with an increased risk of developing hepatic complications and death in patients with cirrhosis of the liver. Diabetes mellitus increases the risk of complications of liver cirrhosis of any etiology (varicose veins of the esophagus, hepatic encephalopathy, hepatic-cell insufficiency) and subsequent survival. The incidence, frequency of hospitalizations and mortality from this combined pathology are very high. There are common mechanisms that provoke metabolic and autoimmune disorders in the development of chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis, leading to steatosis, insulin resistance, impaired glucose tolerance and the development of diabetes mellitus. There are certain features of the evaluation of the compensation of carbohydrate metabolism in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, anemia and impaired protein metabolism. Effective control of glycemia can have a beneficial effect on the treatment of these patients. However, few studies have evaluated the efficacy and safety of antidiabetic drugs and the effect of diabetes treatment on morbidity and mortality in patients with cirrhosis. Previously it was believed that in the presence of cirrhosis the only treatment remains insulin. At present, in connection with the emergence of modern groups of hypoglycemic drugs, as well as new approaches to the treatment of type 2 diabetes, this concept has radically changed. Unfortunately, the issues of correction of carbohydrate metabolism in patients with cirrhosis of the liver are practically not covered in the world literature. This article deals with the correction of carbohydrate metabolism in patients with cirrhosis and <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency</b> of insulin analogs, biguanides, drugs with incretin effect — dipeptidyl peptidase‑ 4 inhibitors, agonists of glucagon-like peptide‑ 1, inhibitors of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 diabetes.

40|$|Liver {{function}} and serum concentrations of rifampicin, a highly cholephilic antibiotic, {{have been studied}} after ingestion of a single dose of 600 mg of rifampicin in 12 patients, six of them having a normal liver and six a cirrhotic, and during treatment with 600 mg of rifampicin per day for 17 days in eight patients, four of them having a normal liver and four a cirrhotic. Rifampicin produced competition {{for the elimination of}} bilirubin and bromsulphalein by the liver. This competition, which seemed to involve mainly the uptake by the liver cell, was always rapidly reversible when treatment was discontinued. It makes it impossible, however, to interpret a bromsulphalein test during treatment with rifampicin. In the eight patients treated for 17 days, apart from the competition already mentioned, no clinical, biological, or morphological abnormalities of the liver were ascertained. But in this limited number of patients {{it is not possible to}} exclude the fact that rifampicin could provoke jaundice by idiosyncrasy in a small percentage of cases. The serum concentrations of rifampicin were higher in cirrhotic patients than in patients with normal livers, especially after one or two weeks of treatment. It is suggested that efficient blood concentrations of rifampicin would be achieved with small doses in case of previous <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency...</b>|$|E
40|$|Orthotopic liver homografting in 59 pigs was {{successful}} in producing survival beyond the immediate operative period in 29 animals. Survivors without immunosuppression were subjected to serial biopsy from 3 days {{to more than one}} year after transplantation. A composite picture of progressive histological changes in the group as well as in individuals has been built up. About 3 days after transplantation, there appeared in homografts (but not in autografts) progressive infiltration of the portal tracts by round cells, which was well established by the second postoperative week, and which was accompanied in severely affected animals by round-cell infiltration of the parenchyma, extensive death of hepatocytes by apoptosis, and canalicular bile stasis. The heavy round-cell infiltration coincided with the appearance of jaundice in about half the animals, and subsided spontaneously with the jaundice. By 4 weeks the lymphocytic infiltration was much less marked, but there developed a progressive fibrosis with disruption of the lobules and the appearance of regenerative nodules. This appeared to vary in speed of development and severity from animal to animal, but was present in most long-term survivors, despite apparent clinical and biochemical evidence of well being. Two long-term survivors died with biochemical and pathological evidence of progressive <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> While acute rejection rarely causes death in this species, changes suggestive of chronic rejection occur in most animals and may cause death from liver failure...|$|E
40|$|Classical galactosaemia (McKusick 230400) is an: {{autosomal}} recessive disorder of galactose metabolism, {{caused by a}} deficiency of the enzyme galactose- 1 -phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT; EC 2. 7. 712). Most patients present in the neonatal period, after ingestion of galactose, with jaundice, hepatosplenomegaly, <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> food intolerance, hypoglycaemia, renal tubular dysfunction, muscle hypotonia, sepsis and cataract. The gold standard for diagnosis of classical galactosaemia is measurement of GALT activity in erythrocytes. Gas-chromatographic determination of urinary sugars and sugar alcohols demonstrates elevated concentrations of galactose and galactitol. The only therapy for patients with classical galactosaemia is a galactose-restricted diet, and initially all galactose must {{be removed from the}} diet as soon as the diagnosis is suspected. After the neonatal period, a lactose-free diet is advised in most countries, without restriction of galactose-containing fruit and vegetables. In spite of the strict diet, long-term complications such as retarded mental development, verbal dyspraxia, motor abnormalities and hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism are frequently seen in patients with classical galactosaemia. It has been suggested that these complications may result from endogenous galactose synthesis or from abnormal galactosylation. Novel therapeutic strategies, aiming at the prevention of galactose 1 -phosphate production, should be developed. In the meantime, the follow-up protocol for patients with GALT deficiency should focus on early detection, evaluation and, if possible, early intervention in problems of motor, speech and cognitive developmen...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a six-year-old Brazilian girl {{referred}} for splenomegaly who first presented with fever, asthenia, and weight loss. Geographical location, clinical exam, and blood laboratories suggested kala-azar. Serology confirmed kala-azar diagnosis, but direct evidence of the parasites was not made. A treatment by meglumine antimoniate is given under hospital surveillance for two weeks. Thereupon, the patient is asympto-matic and all tests are normal. Case Report The female child is six-years-old and comes from Fortaleza in the state of Ceara in Brazil. Initial symptoms began six months ago and included fever, asthenia, and weight loss. The patient had been examined by various general practitioners without diagnosis. She is referred because of increasing splenomegaly. The patient’s clinical exam reveals pale skin and fever (38. 4 ºC). Blood pressure is 90 / 60 mmHg. Pulse is 114 beats/min. She is 1. 10 m tall and weighs only 17 kg. Abdominal exam reveals dis-creet portocaval venous flow with no signs of <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Liver is enlarged, non-tender, and smooth. Spleen is stage 5 hypertrophied. The patient has enlarged inguinal lymph nodes. The remainder of the physical exam is non-contributory. Tests ’ find-ings include: CBC: Normochromic and very microcytic anemia (Hb: 7. 1 g), leucopenia (3, 300 WBC), and thrombopenia (70, 000 platelets/mm 3); ESR: 77 mm for first hour; serol-ogy of leishmaniasis: positive (1 / 1600 using immunofluorescence and 5 archs in elec-trosyneresis); bone marrow biopsy: the medulla is rich, but no Leishmania are seen. The patient is given a meglumine antimoni-ate treatment with increasing doses reaching 60 mg/kg/day after three days. The drug is well-tolerated.

40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVES: We {{report a}} first {{experience}} involving {{the use of}} (90) Y radiolabelled microspheres (TheraSphere) {{for the treatment of}} mainly primary hepatic tumours. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment using TheraSphere microspheres was planned in 15 patients (13 with hepatocellular carcinoma, 2 with neuroendocrine tumour metastases). The treatment was preceded by a first angiography aimed at embolizing the vascularizing arterial branches of other structures outside the liver and evaluating the percentage of pulmonary shunt by scintiscanning after perfusion with (99 m) Tc-MAA. The objective of the treatment carried out during a second angiography was to deliver a dose of 120 +/- 20 Gy (mean+/-SD) to the target hepatic volume. RESULTS: Technical difficulties were encountered in embolizing gastroduodenal or gastric branches in two patients and in one patient these led to cancellation of the treatment. A total of 14 patients were treated with an average activity of 3. 18 GBq. In one patient, the injection was defective (stagnation of microspheres at the outlet of the catheter). SPECT/CT acquisitions provided important information in four patients (visualization of the gallbladder in three; visualization of the stomach in one, leading to a new coiling). The average exposure of the nuclear medicine physician carrying out the injections was 64 +/- 80 microSv at the fingers. A partial response was seen in six patients, stabilization in five and progression in three. One patient presented with a gastric ulcer and two showed an increase in their <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> CONCLUSION: Although sometimes technically difficult, the use of TheraSphere microspheres is a worthwhile therapeutic approach because of the low level exposure of operators and the encouraging rate of response or stabilization. The use of SPECT/CT contributes greatly to helping therapeutic planning, especially in the learning curve or when the angiographic procedure is difficult...|$|E
40|$|This article {{reviews the}} {{influence}} of liver functional status on pharmacokinetic interactions due to inhibition and induction of drug-metabolizing enzymes. Recent human {{studies have shown that}} the magnitude of inhibitory interactions caused by the reversible CYP 1 A 2 inhibitor fluvoxamine decreases as liver function worsens, and virtually vanishes in patients with more advanced <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> This effect of liver dysfunction is independent of the pharmacokinetic characteristics of the CYP 1 A 2 substrate, since it has been observed with both high- and low-clearance drugs. It is most probably due to reduced uptake of the inhibitory drug by the cirrhotic liver. In order to ascertain whether this is a general phenomenon, the following questions remain to be addressed: 1) whether the inhibition of any CYP isoform is reduced in liver disease; 2) whether the effect of liver dysfunction depends on the chemical nature of the inhibitory drug, since both reduced in vivo inhibition and in vitro uptake by the cirrhotic liver have so far been shown only for basic drugs; 3) lastly, if similar effects can also be observed with irreversible and quasi-irreversible inhibitors, as their accumulation kinetics in the hepatocyte may differ from those of a reversible inhibitor. Although many in vivo and in vitro studies have examined the inducibility of drug-metabolizing enzymes in liver disease, available data are incomplete and conflicting, since both well-preserved and severely curtailed responses to inducing agents have been reported. The reasons for these variable responses are most probably methodological, i. e., differences in the type and degree of liver dysfunction of the animals and patients examined, and in the type and dosage of the inducing agent used. Nonetheless, the results of those few studies which used pathologically homogeneous animal or patient groups suggest that, like basal enzyme expression, drug-inducible expression is also substantially preserved in mild to moderate liver disease, whereas it is lost in severe hepatic dysfunction. For a definitive conclusion, further studies are necessary which examine etiologically homogeneous patient groups and stratify patients rigorously according to their functional hepatic reserve. Such studies should also examine inducers with different physicochemical properties and acting by different mechanisms, since the expression of both hepatic transporters and nuclear receptors may be differentially affected by liver function impairment...|$|E
40|$|Portocaval {{shunting}} {{is recommended}} for decrease of the portal pressure and regression of the varicose veins in patients with cirrhosis. But the shunting surgery at cirrhosis {{is limited by the}} high risk of development of hepatic encephalopathy and the <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency</b> in post-surgical period. And the disorder of the hepatic and splanchnic hemodynamics that inevitably appears at different dates after surgery is considered as the main cause of these states. Aim of research. To assess an influence of the shunting surgical interventions on the character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics in patients with cirrhosis in comparison with no-operated patients with compensated and decompensated course of disease. Material and methods. 190 patients with cirrhosis were examined: 133 had gastrointestinal bleeding, 57 – diuretic-resistant ascites. 18 patients underwent surgery – portocaval shunting. 84 patients died during observation (10 after surgery). The duration of observation was from 2 - 3 weeks to 2, 5 - 3 years. All patients underwent the repeated ultrasound examination of abdominal cavity. There were defined the diameter of hepatic and splenic vessels; quantitative and qualitative characteristics of the blood flow in hepatic and splenic arteries, in portal and splenic veins.   Results of research. At assessment of splanchnic hemodynamics we noticed the differences of parameters depending on time that passed after surgery. The changes of portal blood flow in first 3 - 6 month were characterized by the moderate widening of portal and splenic veins at little decrease of its mean linear and volume speed so an inflow of the portal blood still stable. Arterial blood flow in hepatic artery was forced at the expense of both widening of diameter and increase of the mean speed of blood flow. The splenic arterial blood flow practically was not changed.    The reliable decrease of the volume blood flow in portal vein at the expense of decrease of its linear speed was observed in all patients at later dates. An unfavorable sign was an increase of an index of haemostasia in portal vein and of splenic and hepatic portal index in dynamics that took place in all operated patients and in no-operated ones at the stage of decompensation. Conclusions. The character of changes of splanchnic hemodynamics after portocaval shunting is analogous to the one in no-operated patients at transition from the compensated course of cirrhosis to decompensated one. The compensatory mechanism that preserves the volume of the portal inflow to liver is the widening of the portal vein and preservation of the splenic blood flow. The quality of life in post-surgical period is determined by the duration of compensation of hemodynamic disorders</p...|$|E
40|$|Inhibition and {{induction}} of drug-metabolizing enzymes are {{the most}} frequent and dangerous drugdrug interactions. They are an important cause of serious adverse events that have often resulted in early termination of drug development or withdrawal of drugs from the market. Management of such interactions by dose adjustment in clinical practice is extremely difficult because of the wide interindividual variability in their magnitude. This review examines the genetic, physiological, and environmental factors responsible for this variability, focusing on an important but so far neglected cause of variability, liver functional status. Clinical {{studies have shown that}} liver disease causes a reduction in the magnitude of interactions due to enzyme inhibition, which is proportional to the degree of liver function impairment. The effect of liver dysfunction varies quantitatively according to the nature, reversible or irreversible, of the inhibitory interaction. The magnitude of reversible inhibition is more drastically reduced and virtually vanishes in patients with advanced <b>hepatocellular</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> Two mechanisms, in order of importance, are responsible for this reduction: decreased hepatic uptake of the inhibitory drug and reduced enzyme expression. The extent of irreversible inhibitory interactions is only partially reduced, as it is only influenced by the decreased expression of the inhibited enzyme. Thus, for appropriate clinical management of inhibitory drug interactions, both the liver functional status and the mechanism of inhibition must be taken into consideration. Although the inducibility of drugmetabolizing enzymes in liver disease has long been studied, very conflicting results have been obtained, mainly because of methodological differences. Taken together, the results of early animal and human studies indicated that enzyme induction is substantially preserved in compensated liver cirrhosis, whereas no definitive conclusion as to whether it is significantly reduced in the decompensated state of cirrhosis was provided. Since ethical constraints virtually preclude the possibility of performing methodologically rigorous investigations in patients with severe liver dysfunction, studies have recently been performed in animals rigorously stratified according to the severity of liver insufficiency. The results of these studies confirmed that enzyme induction is virtually unaffected in compensated cirrhosis and indicated that the susceptibility of enzyme induction to severe liver dysfunction depends on the type of nuclear receptor involved and also varies among enzyme isoforms under the transcriptional control of the same nuclear receptor. These findings make it clear that no general conclusion can be reached from the study of any particular enzyme and partly explain the conflicting results obtained by previous studies. Since no general guidelines can be provided for the management of drug interactions resulting from enzyme induction, both the effects and the plasma concentration of the induced drug should be strictly monitored. The findings discussed in this review have important methodological implications as they indicate that, contrary to current guidelines, the magnitude of metabolic drug-drug interactions in patients with liver disease cannot be inferred from studies in healthy subjects...|$|E
