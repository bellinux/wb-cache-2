5|$|On {{the night}} of 12 July, Vatutin ordered Soviet forces to prevent any further German advance on Prokhorovka, destroy German forces that had {{advanced}} along the northern bank of the Psel River, and stop the III Panzer Corps from making further progress. Orders issued by the German command for 13 July instructed Totenkopf to consolidate its gains of the previous day and then attack into the flank and rear of the Soviet forces around Prokhorovka. Leibstandarte was to strengthen <b>its</b> <b>front</b> line and co-ordinate its attack on Prokhorovka from the south with Totenkopfs attack from the northwest. Das Reich was to consolidate and strengthen <b>its</b> <b>front</b> line and prepare for an offensive operation to link up with the III Panzer Corps.|$|E

5|$|Editorially, the {{newspaper}} {{remained in the}} liberal Republican camp, both strongly anti-communist and supportive of civil rights. In April, 1963, the Tribune published Martin Luther King's Letter from Birmingham Jail on <b>its</b> <b>front</b> page. The Tribune became a target of Barry Goldwater partisans in the 1964 presidential campaign. The leadership of the Tribune, while agreeing with Goldwater's approach to national defense, believed he pushed it to an extreme, and strongly opposed Goldwater's voting record on civil rights. After some internal debate, the Tribune endorsed Democrat Lyndon Johnson for the presidency that fall. The newspaper also {{played a major role}} in the election of New York City Mayor John Lindsay, a liberal Republican, in 1965.|$|E
5|$|In the African American {{section of}} the city, where most {{dwellings}} were built of discarded material, many homes were damaged. On one street, only two houses did not lose either their walls or roof. Walls and cars were cartwheeling down the streets. During the storm, about 100people ran to a trash incinerator, a concrete-reinforced building. A few of the local Black churches suffered significant damage. Tabernacle Missionary Baptist Church lost many bricks on <b>its</b> <b>front</b> facade {{and much of the}} metal grillwork around the entrances, while the building itself was deroofed. Payne Chapel AME Church, then located at Banyan Boulevard and Tamarind Avenue, was destroyed by the storm. St. Patrick's Catholic Church received about $40,000 in damage.|$|E
5|$|Lee's {{original}} {{plan called for}} Hood and McLaws to attack in concert, but Longstreet held back McLaws while Hood's attack progressed. Around 5 p.m., Longstreet saw that Hood's division was reaching its limits and that the enemy to <b>its</b> <b>front</b> was fully engaged. He ordered McLaws to send in Kershaw's brigade, with Barksdale's to follow on the left, beginning the en echelon attackone brigade after another in sequencethat {{would be used for}} the rest of the afternoon's attack. McLaws resented Longstreet's hands-on management of his brigades. Those brigades engaged in some of the bloodiest fighting of the battle: the Wheatfield and the Peach Orchard.|$|E

5|$|Like {{the other}} members of its genus, the red-throated loon is well adapted to its aquatic environment: its dense bones help it to submerge, its legs—in their {{set-back}} position—provide excellent propulsion, and its body is long and streamlined. Even its sharply pointed bill may help its underwater streamlining. Its feet are large, <b>its</b> <b>front</b> three toes are fully webbed, and its tarsus is flattened, which reduces drag and allows the leg to move easily through the water.|$|E
5|$|Non-bluffing (aposematic) {{displays}} {{occur in}} mammals which possess powerful defences such as spines or stink glands, and which habitually warn off potential predators rather than attempting escape by running. The lowland streaked tenrec (Hemicentetes semispinosus) raises the spines {{on its head}} and back when confronted by a predator, and moves its head up and down. Porcupines such as Erethizon erect their long sharp quills and adopt a hunched, head-down posture when a predator is nearby. The spotted skunk (Spilogale putorius) balances on <b>its</b> <b>front</b> legs, its body raised vertically with its bold pelage pattern conspicuously displayed, and its tail (near the scent glands) raised and spread out.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of 13 July, the 10th Guards Mechanized and 24th Guards Tank Brigades, in {{cooperation}} with the 95th and 52nd Guards Rifle Corps, launched attacks against Totenkopf. These Soviet attacks preoccupied Totenkopf and prevented it from attacking toward Prokhorovka. Around noon, Leibstandartes 1st SS-Panzer Reconnaissance Battalion was ordered to attack northward toward the Psel River to consolidate <b>its</b> <b>front</b> line with Totenkopf, while the division's panzer units were to attack toward Soviet positions northeast of the Oktyabrsky State Farm toward Prokhorovka.|$|E

5|$|The Ecstatic is the 2009 fourth studio album by American rapper Mos Def. After venturing {{further away}} from hip hop with an acting career and two poorly {{received}} albums, Mos Def signed with Downtown Records and recorded The Ecstatic primarily at the Record Plant in Los Angeles. He worked with producers such as Preservation, Mr. Flash, Oh No, and Madlib, the latter two of whom reused instrumentals they had produced on Stones Throw Records. Singer Georgia Anne Muldrow, formerly of the record label, {{was one of the}} album's few guest vocalists, along with rappers Slick Rick and Talib Kweli. For <b>its</b> <b>front</b> cover, a still from Charles Burnett's 1978 film Killer of Sheep was reproduced in red tint.|$|E
5|$|The NK 6th Division shifted {{its axis}} of attack {{and its main}} attacking effort to the {{northern}} part of the Chinju-Masan corridor just below the Nam River in the 35th Infantry's sector. The 35th Infantry set to work to cover <b>its</b> <b>front</b> with trip flares, but they were in short supply and gradually it became impossible to replace them. Illuminating flares were also in short supply, and the reserve stocks had deteriorated to such a degree that only about 20 percent of the supply issued to the regiment was effective. Even when employed, the time lapse between a request for them and delivery by the big howitzers allowed some North Korean infiltration before the threatened area was illuminated.|$|E
5|$|The cathedral sits in {{the center}} of Ponce's central square, Plaza Las Delicias, {{oriented}} east-to-west, with <b>its</b> <b>front</b> entrance facing west. Immediately behind the cathedral, to the east, is the historic fire house, Parque de Bombas. The two buildings effectively divide Plaza Las Delicias into two smaller plazas, named Plaza Muñoz Rivera and Plaza Degetau. Low undulating walls line the cathedral's northern and southern sides, and serve to separate it from the Plazas. Plaza Las Delicias is in barrio Segundo, one of the six core barrios of Ponce that compose Historic Zone designated by the Government of Puerto Rico to preserve the colonial character of the city.|$|E
