5|$|Stephen <b>Hartley</b> began brewing in Tadcaster in 1758. In 1845 Jane <b>Hartley</b> mortgaged {{the brewery}} to David Backhouse and John <b>Hartley.</b> In 1847, Samuel Smith of Leeds {{arranged}} {{for his son}} John to enter the business. Jane <b>Hartley</b> died in 1852, and John Smith acquired the business, enlisting his brother William to help him. The timing was to prove fortuitous; pale ales were displacing porter as the beer of choice, and Tadcaster's hard water proved to be well-suited for brewing the new style. The prosperity of the 1850s and 1860s, together {{with the arrival of}} the railways, realised greater opportunities for brewers, and by 1861 John Smith employed eight men in his brewing and malting enterprise.|$|E
5|$|With General Beckman's (Bonita Friedericy) aid, Chuck {{intercepts}} {{the transport}} carrying Alexei, {{only to find}} that Decker has deprogrammed Alexei and restored his previous identity and memories of <b>Hartley</b> Winterbottom. <b>Hartley</b> administers an antidote, but it fails to cure Sarah. Mary then remembers that Alexei had developed a stronger antidote, but it is stored at the Volkoff Industries Headquarters in Moscow, Russia. As they leave the hospital, Chuck, Casey, Mary, and <b>Hartley</b> are captured by Decker and taken to Castle, a government base under the big-box store Buy More, where Decker suppresses the Intersect in Chuck's mind. Casey helps Chuck and <b>Hartley</b> escape, giving Chuck discs containing clean fabricated identities for him and Sarah.|$|E

5|$|Buffalo Creek {{begins in}} <b>Hartley</b> Township, in Union County, near the Union County/Centre County border. It flows east and {{slightly}} north between Buffalo Mountain and Branch Mountain before falling steeply through two geographical features {{known as the}} Gooseneck and Buffalo Gap. The creek then turns southeast and flows out of <b>Hartley</b> Township. Upon leaving <b>Hartley</b> Township, the creek enters Lewis Township and meanders eastward, south of Jones Mountain. It passes through the Mifflinburg Reservoir. The creek then flows into southern West Buffalo Township and northern Mifflinburg. Shortly before exiting West Buffalo Township, Buffalo Creek picks up its tributary North Branch Buffalo Creek and briefly turns northwards before turning eastward again and leaving the township.|$|E

5|$|Leigh {{was born}} Vivian Mary <b>Hartley</b> on 5 November 1913 in British India {{on the campus}} of St. Paul's School, Darjeeling. She was the only child of Ernest Richard <b>Hartley,</b> an English broker, and his wife, Gertrude Mary Frances (née Yackjee; she also used her mother's maiden name of Robinson). Her father was born in Scotland in 1882, while her mother, a devout Roman Catholic, was born in Darjeeling in 1888 and was of Irish descent. Gertrude's parents, who lived in India, were Michael John Yackjee (born 1840), a man of {{independent}} means, and Mary Teresa Robinson (born 1856), who was born to an Irish family killed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 and grew up in an orphanage, where she met Yackjee; they married in 1872 and had five children, of whom Gertrude was the youngest. Ernest and Gertrude <b>Hartley</b> were married in 1912 in Kensington, London.|$|E

5|$|Startled, The team {{reads the}} files {{on his last}} mission; which was to assist on a {{complicated}} cover-up black operation posing as an international arms dealer; Alexei Volkoff. Stephen Bartowski created the original Intersect prototype and first used it on <b>Hartley,</b> which was updated with the personality, knowledge and identity of Volkoff, a manufactured identity. However, the Intersect was so unstable that it plagued Hartley's mind and deleting his personality as <b>Hartley</b> Winterbottom, instead he started {{to believe that he}} was Alexei Volkoff, an international arms dealer, and as such he established the Volkoff Industries and became an international terrorist and gun manufacturer.|$|E

5|$|After the Bears punted, Garrett <b>Hartley</b> {{kicked a}} 47-yard field goal. On the ensuing possession, Malcolm Jenkins forced Jay Cutler to fumble, and Cameron Jordan {{recovered}} the loose ball {{and reached the}} Bears' 6-yard line. After failing to score a touchdown, <b>Hartley</b> kicked a 19-yard field goal. In the second quarter, the Saints scored off Drew Brees' two-yard screen pass to Pierre Thomas to increase the lead to 13 points. On Chicago's next drive, the offense traveled 70 yards within eight plays, which ended in Jay Cutler's three-yard touchdown pass to Alshon Jeffery. The final score of the half was by Thomas, who caught a 25-yard pass from Brees. In the third quarter, after <b>Hartley</b> kicked a 36-yard field goal, the Bears traveled 71 yards to the Saints' 5-yard line. However, a penalty on Kyle Long for being an ineligible downfield player, followed by three consecutive incomplete passes forced Robbie Gould to kick a 27-yard field goal. Early in the following quarter, Chicago reached New Orleans' 25-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs after Cutler's pass to Earl Bennett on 4th and 2 was dropped. On the Saints' next drive, a neutral zone infraction penalty by Lance Briggs on 4th and 1 allowed <b>Hartley</b> to kick a 48-yard field goal to extend the Saints' lead to 26–10. However, the Bears attempted to rally, with Cutler throwing three consecutive passes to Jeffery, the final throw going 58 yards to the Saints' 2-yard line, where Brandon Marshall scored. Matt Forté's two-point conversion allowed the Bears to narrow the gap to eight points, but the onside kick was recovered by the Saints. Although the Saints were forced to punt, with 21 seconds remaining, Cutler could only manage to throw a pass to Jeffery which reached the Bears' 41-yard line, as time ran out, giving the Saints the 26–18 win. The win {{marked the first time}} the Saints defeated the Bears in an away game since 2002, although that game occurred at Memorial Stadium in Champaign, Illinois.|$|E

Mechanic Mack questions why Coulson would risk lives just to steal a quinjet, but Coulson explains that they need its ability to literally disappear, something they currently cannot do themselves following the injuries engineer Agent Leo Fitz recently suffered {{at the hands of}} Ward; he now struggles with technology and hallucinates the presence of Agent Jemma Simmons, who left S.H.I.E.L.D. some time earlier because of Fitz's condition.|$|E
5|$|Chuck and <b>Hartley</b> go to Volkoff Industries, and <b>Hartley</b> reveals to Vivian {{that he went}} {{undercover}} voluntarily, {{resulting in}} his transformation into the villainous Volkoff. Chuck gives up the discs from Casey so Vivian and her father can start a new life. Chuck returns with the antidote to Burbank, California, where Decker is waiting for him. A standoff occurs, but as Chuck is backed up by a superior force made up of his friends, family, the C.A.T. Squad (Mini Andén and Mercedes Masöhn), and Volkoff's Spetsnaz paratroopers, Decker is forced to stand down. Using the information about Alexei as leverage against Decker, Chuck delivers the antidote.|$|E
