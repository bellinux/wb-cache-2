40|$|There are {{approximately}} 10, 000 hedge funds worldwide, managing assets of over USD 1. 5 trillion. Investment banking activities {{are more and}} more intertwined with hedge funds, as hedge funds obtain financing from banks through prime brokerage and are clients or counterparties of banks for all sorts of products. The development of hedge funds has therefore created many opportunities for investment banks. Bank benefit from hedge funds activities directly to the extent that hedge funds are their clients. All capital market activities benefit from it, from brokerage and research to derivatives. Prime brokerage has become a growing source of income. Banks have a very important business of providing derivatives and products, from vanilla products to more complex, customized and exotic products. Hedge funds are also possible underlyings for derivatives. Many banks, including Société Générale, have developed a business of writing options on hedge funds as well as providing leverage to funds of funds. Investment banks are not only making profits by transacting with hedge funds. They also benefi t indirectly through more trading: on certain specifi c specialized market, like structured complex derivatives, there would be no market at all without the availability of hedge funds that are willing to take the risks. Together, as two intertwined partners, hedge funds and investment banks have extended the reach and effi ciency of capital markets. The benefi ts that this system brings to {{the economy as a whole}} is widely recognized. Not only do hedge funds provide important benefi ts for the economy in general but their risks are manageable. The risks for investors are overplayed. Whatever the risk measure, hedge funds are clearly less risky than equities. As regards operational risks, the market itself is able to generate protection solutions. Academic research has shown that operational risks can be dealt in the most extensive way by using managed account platforms, such as the Lyxor platform. The risks for banks are under control and the move toward “risk-based margining” has improved very much their risk management. Banks in general invest a lot of resources in monitoring hedge funds qualitatively through <b>due-diligences.</b> They also put different types of limits in order to cover different aspects of risks: nominal limits, stress test limits, limits on delta, limits on vega, expected tail loss limits. Moreover, they regulate their capital requirements using not only Value at Risk, the usual tool used by banks to allocate capital to market risks, but also stress tests losses based on the worst possible scenarios. These very sophisticated models are quite convincing. There is no reason to believe that they will not work in practice under stress conditions. There are also general consideration about a systemic risk that would be something else than banking risks, but it has no real argument to back it up. Hedge funds are fi rst of all the result of a signifi cant improvement of asset management techniques. These improvements are here to stay, whatever the regulatory environment will become, since these techniques will be more and more part of the mainstream asset management world. Hedge funds {{are more and more}} institutionalized. They will eventually merge with “classical” asset management, while some forms of compromises between hedge funds and classical asset management, such as absolute return funds or 130 - 30 funds, are becoming more common. Hedge funds are just a nice new development of capital markets that, like all past capital market developments, will be irreversible and will contribute to a more effi cient fi nancial system. ...|$|R

5000|$|Nowadays {{the term}} [...] "Rogallo wing" [...] {{is synonymous with}} one {{composed}} of two partial conic surfaces with both cones pointing forward. Slow Rogallo wings have wide, shallow cones. Fast subsonic and supersonic Rogallo wings have long, narrow cones. The Rogallo wing is a simple and inexpensive flying wing with remarkable properties. The wing itself is not a kite; neither is it a glider nor a powered aircraft, until the wing is tethered or arranged in a configuration that glides or is powered. In other words, how it is attached and manipulated determines what type of aircraft it becomes. The Rogallo wing is most often seen in toy kites, but {{has been used to}} construct spacecraft parachutes, sport parachutes, ultralight powered aircraft like the trike and hang gliders.

50|$|Writing for the minority, in dissent, Justice Bertha Wilson {{argued that}} since the Charter had entered into effect {{at the time of}} Stevens's trial, he was {{entitled}} to its benefit. She distinguished the James case, which held that a search or seizure that took place prior to the Charter coming into force could not constitute a violation of section 8 of the Charter. Wilson wrote that in considering section 7 of the Charter, one must ask whether, {{at the time of the}} projected deprivation of the accused's right to liberty, that deprivation would be in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice or not (paragraph 20). She reasoned {{that since the}} Charter was in full force and effect at the time of the accused's trial, no issue of retrospectivity was raised. She went on to find that the Criminal Code provision contravened section 7 of the Charter by creating an absolute liability offence with the possibility of imprisonment. Wilson further found that the contravention was not saved by section 1 of the Charter. On this issue, Wilson gave extensive consideration to the majority decision of the British Columbia Court of Appeal in R v Ferguson, 1987 6 W.W.R. 481. That decision was written by Justice Beverley McLachlin, who would later join the Supreme Court of Canada as Wilson's colleague. McLachlin had found that the denial of the mistake-of-age defence in the Criminal Code provision was justified under section 1 because it created a strong deterrent against having sexual intercourse with girls, even if they appear to have attained the statutory age. Wilson disagreed with this analysis. She argued that it ascribed an unrealistically high degree of legal sophistication to the average accused (paragraph 48). She further held that a mechanism was available which would constitute a smaller impairment on the rights of the accused: a <b>due-diligence</b> defence.|$|E
5000|$|The fraud {{began to}} unravel rapidly on March 19, 1997, when Filipino Bre-X {{geologist}} Michael de Guzman reportedly committed suicide by jumping from a helicopter in Busang, Indonesia.A body was found four days later in the jungle, missing the hands and feet, and with the penis [...] "surgically removed". On the other hand the body was reportedly mostly eaten by animals and identified from molars and a thumbprint. (According to journalist John McBeth, a body had gone missing from the morgue of the town from which the helicopter flew. The remains of [...] "de Guzman" [...] were found only 400 metres from a logging road. No one saw the body except another Filipino geologist who claimed it was de Guzman. And {{one of the five}} women who considered themselves his wife was receiving monetary payments from somebody long after the supposed death of de Guzman.) A week later, on March 26, 1997, the American firm Freeport-McMoRan, a prospective partner in developing Busang, announced that its own <b>due-diligence</b> core samples, led by Australian geologist Colin Jones, showed [...] "insignificant amounts of gold". A frenzied sell-off of shares ensued and Suharto postponed signing the mining deal. Bre-X demanded more reviews and commissioned a review of the test drilling. Results were not favorable to them, and on April 1, 1997, Bre-X refused to comment. Canadian gold analyst Egizio Bianchini, of BMO Nesbit Burns, considered the rumors [...] "preposterous". A third-party independent company, Strathcona Minerals, was brought in to make its own analysis. They published their results on May 4, 1997: the Busang ore samples had been salted with gold dust. The lab's tests showed that gold in one hole had been shaved off gold jewelry though it has never been proved at what stage this gold had been added to those samples. This gold also occurs in quantities that do not support the actual original assays. Trading in Bre-X was soon suspended on the TSE and NASDAQ, and the company filed for bankruptcy protection.|$|E

40|$|The {{concept of}} this thesis emerged {{from my own}} {{experience}} of mergers and acquisitions in which I had been involved over the past 20 years. Companies make acquisitions, mergers, or joint ventures for technology or geographical reasons, or to consolidate a market. The companies {{have to find a}} way to integrate the two organizations, and typically they face the challenges of combining different business philosophies, visions, leadership styles, and technology innovation management that have developed and manifested over an extended period of time of time. The motivation for the most companies to get involved in acquisitions is to maintain the growth rate, get access to new ideas, and processes that will provide a lasting benefit for the organization. In the thesis, I will examine the difficulties of the integration of one entity into another. Often, companies are acquired for their people's talent and expertise. The cultural and human aspects, however, are not a major consideration during the overall <b>due-diligence</b> process. I conclude that the extremely high failure rate of more than 50 % for mergers and acquisitions is a result of the negligence of a formal cultural and human <b>due-diligence</b> process, and a "human capital balance sheet" needs to become a part of the process. by Ralf T.

40|$|The {{success of}} the {{contemporary}} human rights movement is such that the rights they espouse are increasingly relevant to multinational corporations (MNCs), who, commensurate with their influence within the current world order, potentially impact upon all such rights {{for a wide variety}} of stakeholders. A recent focus of this contentious field within the global public domain, has been the adoption by the United Nations Human Rights Council, of a framework that confers upon corporations a responsibility to respect human rights by undertaking due-diligence: processes by which a company becomes aware of, and manages its human rights impacts. Despite increasing interest in this area, little research exists regarding how MNCs respond to human rights issues. Therefore, through adopting the research strategy of a descriptive case study, this work examines the human rights <b>due-diligence</b> process of a mining and exploration MNC. A novel finding of this research is that the MNC under examination arguably demonstrates a corporate responsibility to respect human rights, and in doing so, addresses several issues associated with this emerging practice. However, the results also suggest that some human rights issues facing MNCs are likely to persist irrespective of resources devoted to their <b>due-diligence</b> processes, such as those reflective of wider challenges to the foundations of the human rights movement itself. This work concludes by arguing that a possible solution to these problems lies in proactive efforts on the part of MNCs to engage their stakeholders within the public domain, and mediate acceptable solutions to these problems...|$|E
