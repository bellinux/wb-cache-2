40|$|The {{correspondence}} between the steady state theory of current transfer and scattering theory {{in a system of}} coupled tight-binding models of 1 -dimensional wires is explored. For weak interwire coupling both calculations give nearly identical results, except at singular points associated with band edges. The effect of decoherence in each of these models is studied using a generalization of the Liouville-von Neuman equation suitable for steady-state situations. An example of a single impurity model is studied in details, leading to a lattice model of scattering off target that affects both potential scattering and decoherence. For an impurity level lying inside the <b>energy</b> <b>band,</b> the transmission coefficient diminishes with increasing dephasing rate, while the opposite holds for <b>impurity</b> <b>energy</b> outside the <b>band.</b> The efficiency of current transfer in the coupled wire system decreases with increasing dephasing.

In this work we study helical Shiba chains and generalize the microscopic theory of subgap <b>energy</b> <b>bands</b> to a regime where the decoupled magnetic <b>impurity</b> <b>energy</b> and the hybridization of different impurity states can be significant compared to the superconducting gap of the host material. From exact solutions of the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation we extract expressions for the topological phase boundaries for arbitrary values of the superconducting coherence length. The subgap spectral problem can be formulated as a nonlinear matrix eigenvalue problem from which we obtain an analytical solution for <b>energy</b> <b>bands</b> in the long coherence length limit.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the atomic and electronic structures of hydrogen saturated silicon nanowires doped with impurity atoms (such as Al, Ga, C, Si, Ge, N, P, As, Te, Pt) using a first-principles plane wave method. We considered adsorption and substitution of impurity atoms at the surface and also their substitution {{at the core of}} the nanowire. In the case of adsorption to the surface, we determined the most energetic adsorption geometry among various possible adsorption sites.

40|$|ABSTRACT Band structures, {{density of}} states, and {{absorption}} spectra of pure, Nd doped, C doped, and Nd-C codoped TiO 2 are calculated using first-principles based on density functional theory.

40|$|We {{consider}} a finite, disordered 1 D quantum lattice with a side-attached impurity. We study theoretically {{the transport of}} a single electron from the impurity into the lattice, at zero temperature. The transport is dominated by Anderson localization and, in general, the electron motion has a random character due to the lattice disorder. However, we show that by adjusting the <b>impurity</b> <b>energy</b> the electron can attain quasi-periodic motions, oscillating between the impurity and a small region of the lattice. This region corresponds {{to the center of}} a localized state in the lattice with an energy matched by that of the impurity. By precisely tuning the <b>impurity</b> <b>energy,</b> the electron can be set to oscillate between the impurity and a region far from the impurity, even distances larger than the Anderson localization length. The electron oscillations result from the interference of hybridized states, which have some resemblance to Pendry's necklace states [J. B. Pendry, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys. 20, 733 - 742 (1987) ].

For zero gate bias, as the <b>impurity</b> <b>energy</b> approaches the Dirac point, the impurity magnetization region diminishes for bilayer and trilayer graphene. When a gate bias is applied, the dependence of impurity magnetic states on the <b>impurity</b> <b>energy</b> exhibits a different behavior for bilayer and trilayer graphene due {{to the opening of}} a gap between the valence and the conduction band in the bilayer graphene with the gate bias applied.
