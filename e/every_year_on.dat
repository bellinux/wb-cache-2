5|$|Similarly, the Sun's December {{solstice}} position (in {{the northern}} hemisphere, {{the lowest point}} on its annual path; in the southern hemisphere, the highest) was in the constellation of Sagittarius, one of two constellations in which the zodiac intersects with the Milky Way. <b>Every</b> <b>year,</b> <b>on</b> the December solstice, the Sun and the Milky Way, appear (from {{the surface of the}} Earth) to come into alignment, and every year precession caused a slight shift in the Sun's position in the Milky Way. Given that the Milky Way is between 10° and 20° wide, it takes between 700 and 1,400 years for the Sun's December solstice position to precess through it. In 2012 it was about halfway through the Milky Way, crossing the galactic equator. In 2012, the Sun's December solstice fell on 21 December.|$|E
