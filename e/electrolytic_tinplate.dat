50|$|Directly after World War II, it {{was decided}} to build a fully {{integrated}} steel works at Vanderbijlpark, and a start was made on this early in 1947. On 4 October 1952 the Vanderbijlpark Works officially opened by His Excellency the Governor General, Dr E.G. Jansen. Several of the new production units started up in 1953, followed by major expansion schemes in 1956, 1960. From 1964 to 1969 a second development phase started at Vanderbijlpark Works. Large extensions were added; older plants modernised to supply higher quality and value-added products such as <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinplate</b> for the canning and beverage industries.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} of <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinplate</b> coated with gold- and aluminum-plated sanitary lacquers employed to contain sugar food products was studied. Susceptibility to corrosion by electrochemical measurements and surface deterioration by {{scanning electron microscopy}} were also evaluated. The results showed the importance of an adequate selection of tinplate/lacquer to contain sugar food products and prevent contamination by ionic dissolution {{as a consequence of}} can corrosion. ...|$|E
40|$|Plant trial {{evaluations}} {{have been}} completed for two zirconium-based, non-chromium passivation systems previously identified as possible alternatives to cathodic dichromate (CDC) passivation for <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinplate</b> (ETP). These trials were done on a commercial electrolytic tin plating line at Weirton Steel and extensive evaluations of the materials resulting from these trials {{have been completed}}. All this was accomplished as a collaborative effort under the AISI Technology Roadmap Program and was executed by seven North American Tin Mill Products producers [Bethlehem Steel (now acquired by International Steel Group (ISG)), Dofasco Inc., National Steel (now acquired by U. S. Steel), U. S. Steel, USS-Posco, Weirton Steel, and Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel] with funding partially from the Department of Energy (DOE) and partially on an equal cost sharing basis among project participants. The initial phases of this project involved optimization of application procedures for the non-chromium systems in the laboratories at Bethlehem Steel and Betz Dearborn followed by extensive testing with various lacquer formulations and food simulants in the laboratories at Valspar and PPG. Work was also completed at Dofasco and Weirton Steel to develop methods to prevent precipitation of insoluble solids {{as a function of}} time from the zirconate system. The results of this testing indicated that sulfide staining characteristics for the non-chromium passivation systems could be minimized but not totally eliminated and neither system was found to perform quite as good, in this respect, as the standard CDC system. As for the stability of zirconate treatment, a method was developed to stabilize this system for a sufficient period of time to conduct plant trial evaluations but, working with a major supplier of zirconium orthosulfate, a method for long term stabilization is still under development...|$|E
40|$|In {{this highly}} {{competitive}} market where {{the demand for}} the products is increasing gradually, {{it is essential for}} a manufacturing company to reduce the production cycle time and cost accordingly. One of the methods for this is to increase the availability of process. This paper attempts to identify and quantify the causes of machine downtime in a manufacturing company. For this a four-prong approach is taken: Firstly, the major causes for the low availability of process are determined, where bearing failure is found to be the major causes of low availability. Second, combining desirability function approach and data envelopment analysis are performed to identify the sensitive input variables that affect the bearing failure. Thirdly, ordinary linear regression is used to validate the results of DEA. Lastly, some managerial implications to reduce the downtime were suggested. We have considered an <b>electrolytic</b> <b>tinplating</b> line process in a tin sheet manufacturing company as a case study. data envelopment analysis; DEA; linear regression; machine availability; machine downtime; desirability function; bottleneck identification; bottlenecks; manufacturing equipment; bearing failure; electrolytic tinplating; tin sheet manufacturing. ...|$|R
5000|$|Yorkville Works at Yorkville, Ohio, which {{consisted}} of the first cold reduced black plate for tinning. The first tandem mill of its kind was installed in 1928. The facility produced <b>electrolytic</b> and hot-dipped <b>tinplate,</b> black plate, and terneplate. It also had a metal decorating plant for coating and lithographing tin, terne, and black plate, and two electrolytic tin plate lines that produced tin plate at up to 1,000 feet per minute.|$|R
40|$|THE EFFECT OF THE <b>ELECTROLYTIC</b> CONDITIONS OF <b>TINPLATE</b> PRODUCTION ON DIFFUSION CONTROL GROWTH OF THE INTERMETALLIC COMPOUND FESN 2 HAS BEEN INVESTIGATED. ANALYSIS OF THE DIFFUSION PROFILES AND MEASUREMENTS OF VOLUME DIFFUSION COEFFICIENTS SHOW THE DEPENDENCE OF THE DIFFUSION PROCESS FROM THE CONDITIONS OF THE SUBSTRATE CLEANING, THE ELECTRODEPOSITION AND THE REFLOWING TEMPERATURE. CALCULATION OF THE REACTION TIME BETWEEN FE AND SN GIVES THE POSSIBILITY TO ANTICIPATETHE ALLOY THICKNESS. THIS RESULTS IN A REDUCTION OF THE ENERGY CONSUMPTION BY, AT LEAST 10 % IN COMPARING WITH THE CONVENTIONAL CONTROL OF THE REFLOWING PROCESS. ...|$|R
