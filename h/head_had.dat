5|$|In August 1958, workmen digging peat {{in an area}} of Chat Moss near Worsley {{discovered}} a severed head and called the police. It was initially believed that the <b>head</b> <b>had</b> been in the bog for less than a year, and so a search was conducted for more remains, but nothing was found. After X-rays and chemical tests, it was determined that the <b>head</b> <b>had</b> been in the bog for at least 100 years. An inquest was held into the man's death, at which the coroner returned an open verdict, and the head was put in the care of the Manchester Medical School.|$|E
5|$|By 2002, Machine <b>Head</b> <b>had</b> {{sold over}} 1.3 million albums worldwide, and overall Supercharger (mixed by Colin Richardson) {{would go on}} to sell 250,000 copies worldwide, which was their lowest selling album to date. Once the tour for the album had been completed, Machine Head and Roadrunner Records {{mutually}} decided to sever ties with regards to distribution in North America and around the world, however to fill the ties, the band released Hellalive (also mixed by Colin Richardson) which was a recording of a Brixton Academy, London set.|$|E

When a sunflower family flower <b>head</b> <b>has</b> only disc flowers that are sterile, male, or have {{both male and}} female parts, it is a discoid <b>head.</b> Disciform <b>heads</b> <b>have</b> only disc flowers, but may have two kinds (male flowers and female flowers) in one <b>head,</b> or may <b>have</b> different <b>heads</b> of two kinds (all male, or all female). Pistillate <b>heads</b> <b>have</b> all female flowers. Staminate <b>heads</b> <b>have</b> all male flowers.|$|R

5|$|In flashback, Dales tells Mulder about {{first meeting}} Exley in 1947. Dales (portrayed {{as a young}} man by Frederic Lane), a member of the Roswell Police Department, has been {{assigned}} to protect a hesitant Exley. Dales travels with Exley and his teammates on their bus, and one night sees that the sleeping Exley is reflected in a window as an alien. The next day, during a game, Exley is hit by a pitch and starts making utterances in a strange language before returning to his senses. Afterwards, Dales notices that a mysterious green ooze appeared where Exley's bleeding <b>head</b> <b>had</b> rested.|$|E
5|$|Koalas were {{hunted for}} food by Aboriginals. A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone hand axe or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's <b>head</b> <b>had</b> a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hartnell's grave, {{the grave}} of Private William Braine was largely intact. When he was exhumed, the survey team saw signs that his burial had been hasty. His arms, body, and <b>head</b> <b>had</b> not been {{positioned}} carefully in the coffin, {{and one of his}} undershirts had been put on backwards. The coffin seemed too small for him; its lid had pressed down on his nose. A large copper plaque with his name and other personal data punched into it adorned his coffin lid.|$|E

5|$|A {{journalist}} {{from the}} Eastern Daily Press {{reported on the}} head in March 1967, stating that it had undergone laboratory tests which had established it to be made out of 2200-year-old English oak. Howard told the reporter that when living in Norwood Hill, Surrey, the race car driver Donald Campbell rubbed the head of Atho for luck before making his attempts to break the world land speed record. In July 2008, Howard's son Peter confirmed to the researcher Melissa Seims that he had witnessed his father constructing the Head, {{and that it was}} thus fake. Seims suggested that the design of the <b>head</b> <b>had</b> been inspired by an older folkloric artefact, the Dorset Ooser.|$|E
5|$|For the {{following}} four seasons Palace achieved respectable top half finishes, and poached the Bury manager Bert Head after persistence from chairman Arthur Wait in early 1966. <b>Head</b> <b>had</b> been with Bury less than a season. The new manager promoted from the youth team and transferred in players new and old, and delighted fans by re-signing Johnny Byrne. His work paid dividends in the 1968–69 season when Palace, not fancied as promotion candidates {{at the beginning of}} the season, finished second behind Derby County who were managed by Brian Clough. Palace had achieved a place in the top flight for the first time in their history, clinching promotion with a 16-game unbeaten run to end the season.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Norman {{included}} Eolambia for {{the first}} time in a comprehensive phylogenetic analysis of iguanodonts, as part of a chapter focusing on iguanodonts in the second edition of The Dinosauria. He found that Eolambia was the sister group to Altirhinus, with both of them being more basal than Protohadros, Probactrosaurus, or the Hadrosauridae. Within the same volume, Horner, Weishampel, and Catherine Forster conducted a separate phylogenetic analysis of hadrosaurids, likewise including Eolambia. They found Eolambia again as a non-hadrosaurid hadrosauroid, albeit as the sister group to Protohadros. Although <b>Head</b> <b>had</b> specifically redefined the Hadrosauridae, based on shared characteristics, to include Protohadros, Horner and colleagues adapted a taxon-based definition that excluded Protohadros and thus Eolambia. They also identified additional characteristics differentiating Eolambia from hadrosaurids: there are coarse denticles on the teeth of the dentary, and the coronoid process is weakly expanded.|$|E

5|$|McCann was {{the first}} member of the 10th Battalion to be awarded the Military Cross, and was also the first unit officer to receive an award in the field for any {{specific}} action. The wound to his <b>head</b> <b>had</b> severely fractured his skull, but he remained at his post until he had reported the situation to the commanding officer of the 9th Battalion. He was evacuated to hospital in England, and his award of the Military Cross was reported in the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper on 29 September along with a photograph and brief details of his service. After he had recovered sufficiently, he attended an investiture at Buckingham Palace on 4 October where he received his Military Cross from King George V. On the same day, a fellow 10th Battalion officer, Arthur Blackburn, received his Victoria Cross for his own actions at Pozières that closely followed those of McCann. McCann was medically classified to be returned to Australia on a hospital ship, but avoided these orders and returned to his battalion in France in November. On his return, he was placed in command of B Company. In February 1917 he was evacuated suffering from illness, and after recovering was sent to a training school for a month. He rejoined the battalion in March.|$|E
