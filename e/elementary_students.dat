5|$|All {{pleas for}} {{financial}} help are in vain, including {{a private school}} play performed in front of Mr. Burns at his mansion, until Jim Hope, {{the president of a}} company named Kid First Industries, buys the school and privatizes it. The school's staff is replaced, and classes now focus on toys and marketing. Lisa soon discovers that the company that bought Springfield Elementary is a toy company, using students for research to make a new popular toy in time for the Christmas shopping season. She is then frightened by the appearance of a robotic figure. When Bart and Lisa are back at home, watching television, they see an advertisement for a toy named Funzo. It has many features suggested by Springfield <b>Elementary</b> <b>students</b> during a brainstorming session at the school. They visit Jim Hope's office to complain, and he apologetically gives them a free Funzo toy. Bart and Lisa later discover that Funzo is programmed to destroy other toys.|$|E
5|$|Barrington Civic Center Historic District is a {{historic}} district in Barrington, Rhode Island on County Road. The district, which consists of the Barrington Town Hall, Leander R. Peck School and Prince's Hill Cemetery, is located on Prince's Hill {{near the center of}} Barrington. In 1728, Prince's Hill Cemetery was purchased and later expanded to its present size by 1898. The -story Barrington Town Hall was completed in 1888 and originally served as the seat of the town's government, library and high school. With the completion of the Leander R. Peck School in 1917, the high school moved into the adjacent building and the library used its space. The two-story Elizabethan Revival style Peck School is designed with a T-shaped plan and features a stairway to access the main entrance on the second story. The Peck School was later used by the fifth and sixth grade <b>elementary</b> <b>students</b> before becoming the public library. Also located within the district is Wood's Pond. The Barrington Civic Center Historic District was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1976, and serves as historically significant example of civic and natural environment planning of the late nineteenth century.|$|E
5|$|Lisa imagines she and all {{the other}} Springfield <b>Elementary</b> <b>students</b> are Hebrews in ancient Egypt, with the Pharaoh (Principal Skinner) making them build a pyramid. Only Moses (Milhouse) can {{liberate}} the Hebrews. When Bart defaces the Pharaoh's sarcophagus, supposedly incited by the burning bush, he gets the other students punished. Lisa helps Milhouse produce plagues to scare the Pharaoh into freeing the Israelites; they fail. This in turn gets Lisa and Milhouse thrown in a Pyramid prison. When they escape, Milhouse gathers all the students and they attempt to leave. When they reach the sea, Lisa has an idea to get across: They simultaneously flush all the Egyptians' toilets to drain the sea. As they cross, the Pharaoh and his guards follow, but the water fills the sea back up and swallows them. They enjoy splashing each other, and then return to the shore. Pleased that they have escaped, Milhouse asks Lisa what the future holds for the Israelites, but Lisa disappoints Milhouse when she says that they have to wander the desert for forty years. Milhouse then asks if {{it is going to be}} smooth sailing for the Jews after that. Rather than disappoint Milhouse again with news of the ongoing anti-Semitism that will plague the Jews for many centuries, she distracts the crowd by sending them to search for manna.|$|E

25|$|A {{study by}} Conklin and Wilkins shows growth and {{advances}} in reading levels among <b>elementary</b> <b>students</b> when using a guided reading approach. Working {{with the teacher}} in small groups gave students {{a chance to work}} on specific skills, at their reading level. Students gained confidence when reading 'just right' texts. Since they were not struggling with the text they were able to develop vocabulary, reading comprehension skills and oral language skills. Gabl, Kaiser, Long and Roemer found similar results when providing reading intervention in the form of guided reading groups to grade two and grade four students. The results showed an increase in reading fluency and comprehension after using flexible grouping in guided reading.|$|E

Students are also assessed by performance, cognitive ability tests, and motivation. There are 4 MACC's in Vancouver: grade 4/5 and grade 6/7 at Sir William Osler Elementary, grade 5/6/7 at Tecumseh Elementary, and a French Immersion grade 5/6/7 at Kerrisdale Elementary.|$|E

25|$|Educational {{outreach}} at the Folger {{began in}} the early 1970s; today, the Folger Education department continues those early efforts with a variety of programs for K–12 students and teachers that emphasize an active learning approach to Shakespeare. Teachers gather at the Folger for day-long and month-long programs to work to incorporate Shakespeare and performance in the classroom. The department also publishes a variety of materials for classroom use. Student programs include workshops, local residency initiatives, and a high school fellowship program during which students study Shakespeare at the Folger. The Emily Jordan Folger Children's Shakespeare Festival, founded in 1980, allows <b>elementary</b> <b>students</b> to perform every spring. The Secondary School Shakespeare Festival, founded the following year, brings students from grades 7–12 to perform half-hour collections of Shakespeare scenes in the Folger theater.|$|E
25|$|According to the Christian Heritage Academy website, {{the school}} began in 1972 {{with a vision}} of Sunnyside Baptist Church and its pastor, Harry Boydstun. Prior to the school's founding, {{demographic}} changes in primary education were taking place in Oklahoma City and in other cities across America. In the 1971 Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenburg Board of Education ruling, the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of busing to end school segregation and dual school systems. The federal courts began mandating that enrollment be racially balanced {{in the public school}} systems and be achieved through the forced busing of <b>elementary</b> <b>students.</b> Many parents were alarmed that the public schools were being radically reorganized and their children would be transported miles across town to be taught in some other place than their neighborhood schools. The movement of large numbers of white families to suburbs of large cities, so-called white flight and a string of Supreme Court decisions, reduced the effectiveness of the busing policy.|$|E
25|$|The Detroit Waldorf School {{was founded}} in 1965 by Rudolf and Amelia Wilhelm, who wanted to provide Detroiters more choices in educating their children. Other private schools in the area {{at the time were}} not integrated, and the Wilhelms and their {{supporters}} sought to provide a diverse educational experience to children. The school approached the board of the Central United Methodist Church about allocating space to open a nursery school. An impassioned speech by African-American Junius Harris, where he reminded Board members that families of color had far fewer educational choices for their children, convinced the board to allow the Waldorf nursery school to open in their building. The school opened as a nursery school in the Central United Methodist Church in 1965, and was deliberatley integrated from its founding. However, space in the church was limited, and later that year the school acquired the just-vacated Liggett campus. Classes for <b>elementary</b> <b>students</b> began at the present school building in September 1966. The Detroit Waldorf School {{was one of the first}} nine Waldorf schools in North America, and a founding member of the Association of Waldorf Schools of North America (AWSNA).|$|E
