5|$|Fares on Community Transit buses {{are priced}} into three groups: adult, youth, and reduced. Adult <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> charged for {{passengers}} {{between the ages}} of 19 and 64, youth <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> charged for passengers between ages 6 & 18, and the reduced <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> charged for passengers over the age of 65 or those with disabilities or Medicare card holders.

Fares also change based on service level, with local service within Snohomish County costing the least and commuter service to Seattle being more expensive; commuter service from southern Snohomish County and Everett is also less costly compared to commuter service from northern and eastern Snohomish County. The last fare increase occurred on July 1, 2015, raising the adult and DART fares by 25 cents.|$|E
5|$|Ticketing and fares are {{integrated}} with Lothian Buses. The single <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> {{the same as}} on Lothian Buses, and day tickets and Ridacards are valid on trams and buses. A single journey between any two stops {{with the exception of}} Edinburgh Airport costs £1.60 for adults and 80p for children.

5|$|Increased {{service was}} {{provided}} during the 1960 spring meeting with Saturday and holiday service. During its first year, the service carried 341,000 riders. During the 1960s the extra <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> collected at special turnstiles {{at the three}} stations served by the special. Larger tokens were used. On July 5, 1966, the fare on the Aqueduct Special was raised to 75 cents. The <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> raised to $1 on January 4, 1970. The <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> raised from a $1 to $1.50 in February 1972. Later on the <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> lowered back to $1. The <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> raised back to $1.50 on June 28, 1980.|$|R
50|$|The minimum bus <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> one Anna (6 paise), and {{the maximum}} bus <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> three Annas (20 paise). They were in force from 1-1-47.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>fares</b> <b>were</b> {{increased}} {{several times}} during the system's history. The most recent increase was on April 5, 2010. The <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> now the following: ...|$|R
5|$|In 2017, for {{a one-way}} Taipei–Zuoying trip, a THSR Standard Car adult ticket is NT$1,490, {{which was about}} $47 USD; a Business Car ticket <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> NT$1,950, about $62 USD. The cost of a non-reserved seat is {{approximately}} 3% less than the regular price. Business and standard car reserved ticket reservations are available 28 days prior to the date of departure (including the departure day).|$|E
5|$|Lothian Buses have {{operated}} a flat-fare system, charged per adult, since March 2006; child fares, all-day tickets, pre-paid multiple singles and 'Ridacards' are also available, with senior citizens travelling on free travel passes {{in line with}} the rest of Scotland. , an Adult single <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> £1.60, and a child fare costs 80p.

5|$|Riders {{enter and}} exit the system using a stored-value {{card in the}} form of a {{proximity}} card known as SmarTrip. The <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> deducted from the balance of the card when exiting. SmarTrip cards can be purchased at station vending machines, online or at retail outlets, and can store up to $300 in value.|$|E
50|$|From 1921 until 1953, one TTC <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> {{good for}} any {{distance}} within the City of Toronto. Where routes extended outside the city, extra <b>fares</b> <b>were</b> charged.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> paid {{on board}} and the <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> based on distance. They come in 12 and 25 seater versions. The maxi taxi was {{introduced}} in 1978.|$|R
50|$|BPT's buses use the {{following}} route number scheme and fare schedule. On January 1, 2007, bus <b>fares</b> <b>were</b> significantly reduced. On December 28, 2014, bus <b>fares</b> <b>were</b> increased to help cover operation costs.|$|R
5|$|Riders pay {{a single}} fare {{to enter the}} subway system and may {{transfer}} between trains {{at no extra cost}} until they exit via station turnstiles; the <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> a flat rate regardless of how far or how long the rider travels. Thus, riders must swipe their MetroCard upon entering the subway system, but not a second time upon leaving.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fare</b> <b>is</b> payable by MetroCard. Since {{this card}} enables free {{transfers}} for a continuing {{ride on the}} subway and bus systems, for many more riders there is effectively no fare at all for riding SIR. Riders are also allowed to transfer between a Staten Island bus, SIR, and a Manhattan bus or subway near South Ferry. Because of this, the SIR's farebox recovery ratio in 2001 was 0.16that is, for every dollar of expense, 16 cents was recovered in fares, the lowest ratio of MTA agencies. The low farebox recovery ratio {{is part of the}} reason the MTA wishes to merge the SIR with the subway proper which will simplify the accounting and subsidization of what is essentially a single line.|$|E
5|$|Fares for Metro {{light rail}} service {{are the same}} as those for most Metro Transit bus {{services}} and include unlimited transfers to other light rail and bus routes within 2.5 hours from the time a <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> paid. Two exceptions exist for Metro light rail services: fares within (but not between) downtown zones are less expensive than regular fares but may not be transferred; and there is no cost to ride between terminals 1 and 2 at the Minneapolis–Saint Paul International Airport (MSP). Many stations connect with rail or bus routes. The Target Field station provides a connection to the Northstar commuter rail line, while the Mall of America station allows for transfers to the Metro Red Line bus rapid transit service. The A Line bus rapid transit line connects with the 46th Street Blue Line station and the Snelling Avenue Green Line stop. Two Metro light rail stations – 28th Avenue and Fort Snelling – have designated park and ride lots.|$|E
50|$|Demand {{response}} <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> $2.00 one {{way inside}} Manhattan, Junction City, and Fort Riley city limits. <b>Fares</b> <b>are</b> $4.00 for locations {{more than three}} miles beyond city limits but still within the service area.|$|R
50|$|Single journey <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> valid {{only for}} single trip between any two points. They are issued on paper ticket by the bus conductor. All <b>fare</b> {{payments}} must <b>be</b> made in cash. The fare depends on {{distance of the}} destination. Single journey <b>fare</b> <b>are</b> not valid for transfers.|$|R
50|$|Intercity train <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> more {{expensive}} than slower trains on preexisting lines. <b>Fares</b> <b>are</b> {{more expensive}} for extended trips to Tanggu and cheaper for trips from Beijing South or Tianjin to the midway Wuqing station.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, {{the most}} recent year for which {{statistics}} are available, AirTrain JFK carried 6,487,118 paid passengers, with another 10 million using the service for free on-airport travel. This is a 247% increase over 2004, the first full year of operation, when 2,623,791 riders paid. The 2014 paid ridership is 12% of the 53.2 million passengers that used JFK that year. The ridership of AirTrain JFK has risen each year from 2004 to 2014, which Governor Andrew Cuomo touted in a 2015 announcement in which he also announced the plan for AirTrain LaGuardia, a similar system to be built at LaGuardia Airport. The $5 <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> much cheaper than the $45 one must pay for a taxi between Manhattan and JFK, which may be a factor in the increased ridership.|$|E
5|$|The Eastern Upper Peninsula Transportation Authority (EUPTA) {{operates}} the Drummond Island Ferry across the De Tour Passage {{in addition to}} two other ferries and the regional rural bus system for Luce and Chippewa counties. As part of the service between De Tour and Drummond Island, EUPTA operates up to three different vessels: the SS Drummond Islander, SS Drummond Islander III and the SS Drummond Islander IV. , fares start at $12 per car and increase based {{on the size of}} the vehicle transported, including a fuel surcharge. Passenger fares are $2 for adults and $1 for seniors or students; the vehicle driver's <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> included in the vehicle charge. Ferries leave Drummond Island at 10 minutes after the hour, from De Tour at 20 minutes to the hour, and run most of the day; some crossing times are only operated seasonally. M-134 is one of two highways in Michigan to use a ferry connection; the other is US10 between Ludington, Michigan, and Manitowoc, Wisconsin.|$|E
5|$|Fares on BART are {{comparable}} to those of commuter rail systems and are higher than those of most subways, especially for long trips. The <b>fare</b> <b>is</b> based on a formula that takes into account both the length and speed of the trip. A surcharge is added for trips traveling through the Transbay Tube, to Oakland International Airport, to San Francisco International Airport, and/or through San Mateo County, a county that is {{not a member of the}} San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit District. Passengers can use refillable paper-plastic-composite tickets, on which fares are stored via a magnetic strip, to enter and exit the system. The exit faregate prints the remaining balance on the ticket each time the passenger exits the station. A paper ticket can be refilled at a ticket machine, the remaining balance on any ticket can be applied towards the purchase of a new one, or a card is captured by the exit gate when the balance reaches zero; multiple low value cards can be combined to create a larger value card but only at specific ticket exchange locations, located at some BART stations. The magnetic strip-based technology was developed by Cubic Transportation Systems with a contract awarded in 1974.|$|E
50|$|TriMet {{tickets and}} passes are {{accepted}} on C-Tran Local and Limited routes; TriMet <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> not accepted on C-Tran Express routes or C-Van; Unvalidated TriMet <b>fares</b> <b>are</b> same as cash, and upgrades are not available.|$|R
50|$|The Charlotte, Columbia and Augusta Railroad printed fare {{tickets in}} $1, $2, $5 and $10 {{denominations}} that resembled US currency with the vignette of a steam locomotive on the front. The $1 <b>fare</b> ticket <b>was</b> good {{for one person}} for 20 miles. The $2 <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> good for two people 20 miles. The $5 <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> good for one person 100 miles and the $10 <b>fare</b> <b>was</b> good for two people 100 miles. Many businesses along the railroad would accept the railroad fare notes as currency for goods.|$|R
