6000|$|... "I reckon I am," [...] he said. [...] "Yes, I reckon I am. I kind of--hoped--you {{would come}} back. You'd better <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> some breakfast." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do love ice-cream, Angelina," [...] said one. [...] "Let us <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> {{chocolate}} {{and get the}} bouquets, too." [...] And they followed the crowd inside.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{guess we}} had better <b>go</b> right <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the {{authorities}} to take hold,” said Captain Sanders. “This is no matter for us to handle, now we are in United States waters once more.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, then, I {{want this}} case explained. THEY wanted {{to explain it}} to me--as if there hadn't been emotion or {{excitement}} enough already. You knew my orders; how did you dare to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there <b>and</b> <b>get</b> up that riot?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But we won't give it up. Let's <b>go</b> <b>in</b> here <b>and</b> <b>get</b> some coffee, <b>and</b> {{think it}} over a bit." [...] They were {{near one of the}} {{principal}} cafés, which was full of people smoking, and drinking the Viennese mélange out of tumblers.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] replied Isaiah; [...] "we have to {{keep the}} granary door locked, or else he will open the latch with his teeth, and <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the corn." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it out," [...] ses Lewis, who {{pretty well}} guessed who’d ’ave {{to do it}} if Bob didn’t. [...] "It’ll look better for you, too." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll be back soon's I put {{my horse}} up," [...] said Milton to Bettie. [...] "You <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> good 'n' warm, and then we'll {{go over to}} the house." ...|$|E
5000|$|Described as narcissistic. She has {{the ability}} to {{instantly}} alter reality by lying. After her career with The Umbrella Academy, she married her boyfriend, Patrick, and had a daughter named Claire. The couple has since divorced, and Patrick has full custody of their daughter. She is romantically linked to her adopted brother, Spaceboy, however their love for each other is unconsummated as Spaceboy sees himself as somewhat of a monstrosity due to his martian-gorilla body. She has a cybernetic left hand, as Dr. Terminal devoured her original hand when she was a child, though in [...] "Dallas" [...] when she <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> vocal surgery, her arm is no longer drawn as if it were mechanical, showing that her arm had also been fixed.|$|R
6000|$|Dick's figure straightened. 'Let's {{get near}} 'em. Let's <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> look. Let's <b>get</b> {{on the grass}} and run. I can smell the trees.' ...|$|R
50|$|After a wild night out, {{a teenage}} girl named Jordan (Anna Attanasio) is brought to Princeton Plainsboro with {{severely}} swollen appendages. The team must work to diagnose Jordan, who is less than honest about what happened the night she fell ill. House suspects she is suffering from rhabdo and the fall caused crushed muscles which released toxins that caused swollen joints. But the CT {{shows no signs of}} trauma, so House <b>goes</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>gets</b> Jordan to pretend to play the drums. Her hands are very weak. House notes that her chart shows low potassium, and rhabdo elevates potassium levels, meaning her potassium had to be extremely low the previous night. This means she can't have climbed stairs, meaning there was no fall. House says something else is causing her low potassium and rhabdo.|$|R
60|$|The farmer {{helped him}} {{about all the}} arrangements, and, when they were completed, he told Jonas to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> his supper, and go to bed, so as {{to get up and}} set off early in the morning.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's not likely. But {{we can use}} the graders {{from the}} camp up the line... Neale, <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> guns and a bite to eat. I'll have a horse here ready for you. I want you to ride out after those graders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Prevent throubles," [...] soliloquised Thady; [...] "there is no {{way with}} me to prevent all manner of throuble--I believe I'll <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a tumbler of punch;"--and {{determined}} to adopt this mode of quieting troubles, {{if he could not}} prevent them, he followed Ussher.|$|E
6000|$|Dick's figure straightened. [...] "Let's {{get near}} [...] "em. Let's <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> look. Let"s <b>get</b> {{on the grass}} and run. I can smell the trees." ...|$|R

Casey {{tells the story of}} a Koori parent leaving his child, overheard outside the centre You <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there <b>and</b> <b>get</b> what I can’t give you. Those theatre people can give it to you.|$|R
6000|$|... --O, Dedalus, he cried, Doyle is {{in a great}} bake about you. You're to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> at once <b>and</b> <b>get</b> {{dressed for}} the play. Hurry up, you better.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think D 21 {{was alive}} to the humour of the situation. He {{suggested}} that Robertson (the {{man in the}} night-shirt) should <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> some clothes on, whilst he himself would wait for the inspector and the detective, whom D 15 would send round from the station immediately.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should be}} all right, if I were once in a seaport. No one {{would be likely to}} ask me any questions. Then I could stroll about, and listen to what was said and, certainly, I could talk quite well enough to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a meal, and all that sort of thing." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He’s goin’ {{to call at}} my place," [...] {{continued}} the other, [...] "and tell Mrs. Church that I’ve been took unwell at the Cauliflower at Mapleden, and want to see her, and he’s to bring her there at once. Arter they’ve started I <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> to bed, and earthquakes wouldn’t wake me, let alone {{a knock at the}} door. D’ye see?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We {{have no time}} to waste, Mr. Fulton. Let us <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> let me <b>get</b> to work. I {{dare say}} the cook will be back before I have taken off my gloves.' ...|$|R
60|$|With an enthusiasm which Mr. Heard made {{no attempt}} to share, he led the way to the place indicated, and dilating upon its {{manifold}} advantages, urged him to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> at once <b>and</b> <b>get</b> it over.|$|R
6000|$|... "One of us {{must get}} Bob Pretty up 'ere to-morrow night and stand 'im a pint, or p'r'aps two pints," [...] he ses. [...] "While he's here two other chaps must 'ave a row close by his 'ouse and pretend to fight. Mrs. Pretty and the young 'uns are sure to run out to look at it, and while they are out another chap can <b>go</b> <b>in</b> quiet-like <b>and</b> <b>get</b> the hamper." ...|$|R
60|$|Franco {{ran off to}} {{the shed}} where Jonas had {{harnesses}} his horses, and began smelling around upon the ground. He followed the scent along the yard, up to a post {{by the side of}} the house, where Jonas had stopped a moment ago to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> his great-coat, when all was ready; and then, after pausing here a moment, he darted off towards the road.|$|E
60|$|Marco {{went toward}} the house {{intending}} to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> his goad-stick. On his way he met his uncle. His uncle asked him whether James {{was out in the}} barn. Marco said that he was, and his uncle then asked him to go and request James to come to him. Marco did so, and he and James then came along {{toward the house}} together.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{sorry to}} have frightened you," [...] he said faintly. [...] "Sally!--Dear, dear little Sally, <b>go</b> <b>in,</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> your things on directly. You must come out with me; I'll tell you why afterwards. My God! why didn't I find this out before?" [...] He noticed Toff, {{wondering}} and trembling. [...] "Good old fellow! don't alarm yourself--you shall know about it, too. Go! run! get the first cab you can find!" ...|$|E
5000|$|On November 20, 2009, {{he signed}} a two-year {{extension}} with the Cubs worth $7.5 million. [...] General Manager Jim Hendry said: [...] "It was really imperative we re-sign Grabow, because he's not only our kind of guy and very successful, but has some experience and some savvy to him and can pitch seventh, eighth, ninth, matchups, righties, lefties. It doesn't matter." [...] Grabow {{said he had no}} preference as to how he was used: [...] "If it's the sixth inning or if it's the ninth inning, it doesn't matter. Your job is to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there <b>and</b> <b>get</b> guys out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{often do}} <b>go</b> on <b>in</b> ignorance, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> on a wrong tack; {{but you know}} God pardons our mistakes, and I do believe {{that you will be}} wiser for all this sorrow, and better able to rise to your work. I am sure, however it ends, that is the reason that such blows are sent to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{would rather}} have gone on under this reduced sail," [...] he said to Mr. Atherton, in whom he had great confidence, [...] "if we had been sure of fine weather; but that we cannot reckon upon {{at this time of}} year, and I should not like to be caught in another gale in this {{crippled}} state so near the islands. So of the two evils I consider it the least to <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> try <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a spar that will do for our purpose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gott!" [...] {{he cried}} presently, rubbing {{his hands over}} his face, [...] "but I'd like a cold bath! I've been looking for stray bullet holes in the air-chambers all night until now." [...] He yawned. [...] "I must sleep. You'd better clear out, Smallways. I can't stand you here this morning. You're so infernally ugly and useless. Have you had your rations? No! Well, <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> 'em, and don't come back. Stick in the gallery...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I will," [...] said Josephine sharply. [...] "I'm not a barbarian, I hope, {{to refuse}} {{to go to the}} help of a sick person, if 'twas my worst enemy. I'll <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> ready and you go {{straight}} to the hall stove and warm yourself. There's a good fire in it yet. What on earth do you mean, starting out on a bitter night like this without an overcoat or even mittens, and you with a cold like that?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's a long story, and Oi'll tell it when de others get here," [...] replied Sparrer. [...] "Oi think Oi'll <b>go</b> <b>in</b> <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a d-d-rink of somethin' h-hot." [...] His teeth chattered. It was {{the result}} of nervous {{reaction}} quite as much as cold. Upton, with real concern in his face, sprang forward and put an arm around the shaking youngster and led him into the cabin, then hastened to make him a cup of hot soup. With this in his stomach Sparrer rapidly recovered and by the time Pat, Alec and Hal arrived, the latter whooping joyously, he was quite himself. They brought with them three marten and a fisher.|$|E
5000|$|Not every {{character}} {{action was}} originally in the script. [...] "A {{lot of the}} times," [...] Lozano said, [...] "someone would make me laugh, and then my next line would be about responding to that. Any number of things could happen, which are usually the best moments. I wanted {{to be open to}} that. But it's hard, too, because I didn't want to screw up my lines." [...] She further relayed, [...] "There are many times when I think I didn't get a scene. When you don't feel anything, it's frustrating. I'm less hard on myself because I realize how difficult what we do is. But, as an actor, you hope that you <b>go</b> <b>in</b> there <b>and</b> <b>get</b> caught up <b>in</b> the moment. I think, self-indulgently, that's why we become actors in the first place [...] - [...] to feel things." ...|$|R
5000|$|On 30 October 2015, Aamer {{was flown}} from Cuba, {{stepping}} on British soil at 13.00 GMT. In a later interview he discussed his detention and family life. He also called upon jihadis to [...] "get the hell out" [...] of Britain, stating that civilian killings were [...] "not allowed" [...] <b>in</b> Islam, <b>and</b> <b>went</b> {{on to say}} that [...] "you cannot just <b>go</b> <b>in</b> the street <b>and</b> <b>get</b> a knife <b>and</b> start stabbing people" [...] in apparent reference to the murder of Lee Rigby.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot say, Bertha. I {{shall have}} a talk with Hawkins, presently, as to what course we had better take. It may be best to sail to Bermuda. If we find a mail steamer about to start from there, we might <b>go</b> home <b>in</b> it, <b>and</b> <b>get</b> there a {{fortnight}} earlier than we should do in the yacht, perhaps more. However, that we can talk over. I can see there may be difficulties, but undoubtedly the sooner you are home the better. You see, we are well in November now.|$|R
