5|$|A {{total of}} 51 species of {{parasitic}} worm {{have been recovered}} from the American white ibis, predominantly from the gastrointestinal system and particularly the small intestine. These include Cestoda (tapeworms), Acanthocephala (thorny headed worms), Nematoda (roundworms), Digenea and Spirurida. Several roundworm and spirurid species {{have been found in}} the lining of the gizzard. Nematodes are more prevalent in American white ibis from freshwater habitats, and cestodes more frequent in those from saltwater areas. One nematode found in adult birds, Skrjabinoclavia thapari, is borne in the <b>fiddler</b> <b>crab</b> as an intermediate host, while the thorny headed worm species Southwellina dimorpha is carried in crayfish and infests both adult and juvenile ibis.|$|E

5|$|The Eurasian {{rock pipit}} (Anthus petrosus), or just rock pipit, is {{a species of}} small {{passerine}} bird that breeds in western Europe on rocky coasts. It has streaked greyish-brown upperparts and buff underparts, and is similar in appearance to other European pipits. There are three subspecies, of which only the Fennoscandian form is migratory, wintering in shoreline habitats further south in Europe. The Eurasian rock pipit is territorial {{at least in the}} breeding season, and year-round where it is resident. Males will sometimes enter an adjacent territory to assist the resident in repelling an intruder, behaviour only otherwise known from the African <b>fiddler</b> <b>crab.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> (Uca spp.) {{are one of}} the {{mangrove}} fauna {{that has}} an important role of food chain within the scope of mangrove, which is as a deposit eater. The mangrove area in Kampoeng Kepiting has been damaged due to reclamation for Bali Mandara toll road construction, which can interfere the survival/existence of <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs.</b> Therefore, it is necessary to do a research concerning the abundance of <b>Fiddler</b> <b>Crabs</b> in Kampoeng Kepiting mangrove area. The aim {{of this study is to}} determine the type and abundance of <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> and to discover the coherency among <b>Fiddler</b> <b>Crabs</b> abundance in the manner of c-organic matter content in Kampoeng Kepiting area. <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> samples were carried out using 1 × 1 meter quadrant transect by digging as deep as 30 cm. The abundance of <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> was analyzed under the Krebs equation. The results from this study indicate <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> were found in Kampoeng Kepiting area,i. e. Uca demani, Uca coarctata, Uca dussumieri, Uca bellator, Uca lactea perplexa, Uca tetragonon, Uca chlorophthalmus crassipes, Uca lactea annulipes, Uca triangularis, and Uca vocans. The highest <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> abundance were found at station 4 which is 72 ± 4, 2 ind/m 2, whilst the abundance of <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> (Uca spp.) at station 5 is (33 ± 1, 2 ind/m 2). The c-organic matter content has a strong relationship with the abundance of <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> in Kampoeng Kepiting mangrove area (r = 0, 91). This study shows that mangrove conditions in Kampoeng Kepiting are still able to support <b>Fiddler</b> <b>Crabs</b> (Uca spp.) existence...|$|R

40|$|Wintering Gull-billed Terns Gelochelidon nilotica in Guinea Bissau mainly fed on <b>Fiddler</b> <b>Crabs</b> Uca tangeri {{and were}} {{occasionally}} seen feeding on fish and locusts. <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> {{have a low}} energy content, requiring a large gross intake to meet daily energy demands. <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> also have a low ratio of digestible flesh to exoskeleton, and therefore tern food intake may be limited by gut capacity. Thus feeding on <b>Fiddler</b> <b>Crabs</b> may pose a problem to the terns. Activity budgets of Gull-billed Terns feeding on <b>Fiddler</b> <b>Crabs</b> show that a considerable {{part of the time}} is allocated to quiescence. The duration of resting intervals increased with energy intake and was positively correlated with the metabolisable energy content of the crab eaten, suggesting that resting periods are required for a proper digestion.

25|$|During {{at least}} three glacial periods, {{including}} the Wisconsin glaciation around 20,000 years ago, ice sheets advanced south across North America carving moraines, valleys, and hills. In particular, bays and estuaries were formed along {{the north shore of}} Long Island. During glaciation, what is now Flushing Meadows Park was formed just north of the terminal moraine that runs across Long Island, which consisted of sand, gravel, clay and boulders. The moraine created a drainage divide, with rivers north of the moraine such as the future Flushing River emptying into the north shore. The Flushing Meadows site became a glacial lake, and then a salt marsh after the ice melted. Into the 19th Century, the site continued to consist of wetlands straddling Flushing River. Species inhabiting the site included waterfowl and <b>fiddler</b> <b>crab,</b> with fish using water pools for spawning.|$|E

A preliminary estimate of the crab community structure in the target area of a restocking program was undertaken and indicated a great dominance of <b>fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> (Uca spp).

5000|$|There are crab {{species that}} are {{completely}} aquatic, crab {{species that are}} amphibious, and crab species that are terrestrial. <b>Fiddler</b> <b>crabs</b> are called [...] "semi-terrestrial" [...] since they make burrows in the muddy substrate, to which they retreat during high tides.
