40|$|Thermosonics (also {{known as}} Sonic-IR) has {{potential}} for detecting small fatigue cracks in metals and delaminations in composites. A high power acoustic horn excites a strain pulse in the testpiece which causes relative {{motion of the}} defect surfaces, so generating heat by friction; the resulting local increase in temperature can be detected by an IR camera. Unfortunately the vibration generated by the horn is inherently non-reproducible {{as it is a}} function of the precise contact conditions between the horn and the testpiece. This means that it is difficult to determine whether the test has been carried out successfully. This paper introduces the <b>Heating</b> <b>Index</b> which is a measure of the excitation and {{is a function of the}} induced vibration amplitude and frequency. The <b>Heating</b> <b>Index</b> can be calculated from measurement of the vibration of the testpiece made with any convenient transducer, for example a laser vibrometer or a simple, high frequency microphone. The correlation between the <b>Heating</b> <b>Index</b> and the measured temperature rise at the defect is shown on a variety of laboratory cracked beam specimens. It is shown that measurement of the <b>Heating</b> <b>Index</b> provides a means of ensuring that the test has been carried out satisfactorily.

40|$|Thermosonics {{is capable}} of {{detecting}} cracks in several types of components. The component is excited with high-power ultrasonic vibrations, causing cracks to generate heat, which can be detected by an infrared (IR) camera.

The vibrational energy dissipated as heat at the defect {{is directly related to the}} frequency and amplitude of the vibration, and this energy can be represented by a single parameter (<b>Heating</b> <b>Index)</b> computed from the vibration waveform.

25|$|Relatively speaking, Bucks County {{experiences}} warm/hot {{and humid}} summers with chilly/cold and somewhat snowy winters. Episodes of high humidity (dew point >= 70°F) occur every year during {{or close to}} the summer months, very occasionally reaching extreme (dew point >= 75°F) levels. When high-to-extreme humidity combines with air temperatures in the mid-upper 90's, dangerous <b>heat</b> <b>index</b> values of >= 105°F can sometimes result. Winter minimum air temperatures occasionally fall into the single-digits to slightly below-0°F. When the coldest temperatures combine with higher winds, wind chill values can sometimes plummet below-0°F to as cold as -20°F. Spring and fall are comparatively tranquil. The climate cools as one moves from the lower elevation, dense suburban areas in southern Bucks, to the higher elevation, rural areas of northern Bucks. Precipitation is fairly well-distributed throughout the year. The average seasonal snowfall, which can potentially occur from as early as October to as late as April, is around 2 feet in extreme southern Bucks, and around 3 feet in the highest elevations of far northern Bucks. The fall foliage season typically peaks in mid-October in northern Bucks, mid-late October in central Bucks, and late-October / early-November in southern Bucks. These dates correlate with the typical date of first freeze. Peak spring foliage usually occurs {{during the month of}} April, which correlates with the typical date of last freeze.|$|E
