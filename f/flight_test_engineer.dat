25|$|NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center (formerly the Dryden Flight Research Center) at Edwards, California has {{operated}} two T-34C aircraft. The first aircraft was previously flown at the Glenn Research Center in Cleveland, Ohio, {{where it was}} used for propulsion experiments involving turboprop engines. In 1996 this aircraft was moved Dryden as a chase aircraft. That aircraft was returned to the U.S. Navy in 2002. The second T-34C was obtained in early 2005 from the Naval Air Warfare Center Aircraft Division (NAWCAD) at NAS Patuxent River, where {{it was due to}} be retired. At Armstrong, the T-34C is primarily used for chasing remotely piloted unmanned air vehicles which fly slower than NASA's F/A-18 mission support aircraft can fly. As a NASA mission support chase plane, the back seat would be occupied by a photographer or <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> <b>engineer</b> during research missions.

This {{will allow them to}} focus more of their energies on the collection of data rather than on the design and configuration of their data acquisition hardware. Currently most flight-test engineers spend the majority of their time configuring their data acquisition systems to acquire data for <b>test</b> <b>flights.</b> Typically, the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> <b>engineers</b> must manually transform the requirements that are given to them into actual measurements from the data acquisition system. This process forces the <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> <b>engineers</b> to become experts in the implementation details of their data acquisition systems. This paper will discuss a possible design for an automatic hardware selection system. This system would allow <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> <b>engineers</b> to step away from the implementation details of their data acquisition system and focus instead on the parameter data that the system is acquiring. The key design goal for this system is to create a mechanism that can automatically transform the requirements for a <b>flight</b> <b>test</b> program into a list of hardware that can accomplish the desired task...|$|R

2500|$|In 1958 Irv Culver {{presented}} to the Lockheed management an idea for how to rigidly attach the rotor blades of a helicopter to the hub. [...] In 1920, Juan de la Cierva had tried the same concept, but had trouble controlling the rotor, because of excessive gyroscopic moments. [...] Culver's research led him {{to believe that there}} was a way to control the excessive pitch and roll moments by incorporating a feedback system into the rotor. Culver's solution to high control moments was a device known as the [...] "compliance factor". [...] It kept the blades forward less than a degree, which would apply a corrective feathering input to the opposite blade. [...] This essentially was the moment feedback system.
