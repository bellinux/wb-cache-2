30|$|Hydrophobic {{interactions}} between the contrast microsphere and hollow fibre membranes within an oxygenator (and other components within an ECMO circuit) may also contribute to microsphere destruction.

Common reasons for drug pharmacokinetics being influenced by ECMO in vivo include circuit sequestration, increased volume of distribution, and decreased drug elimination [29]. Whilst not all of these are relevant to <b>our</b> <b>ex</b> vivo circuit, contrast microspheres are hydrophobic but not lipophilic.

The stability of lumped constant was confirmed by the invariance of its theoretical determinants. According to the original Sokoloff statement, the ratio between glucose intake and 2 DG uptake reflects the different affinities for the two hexoses of factors regulating transmembrane transport, hexose phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation: GLUT expression (lambda) was not affected by STS and, similarly, G 6 Pase activity (phi) on both glucose and 2 DG was unchanged regardless nutritional condition. Moreover, direct measurements of Km and Vmax for both glucose and 2 DG documented an absent effect of STS on HK isoforms affinity for the two hexoses.|$|R
