50|$|A {{guidance}} system failure was quickly suspected as the culprit, but JPL navigation chief Bill O'Neil dismissed {{the idea that}} the entire {{guidance system}} had failed. He argued that an autopilot malfunction had occurred since the event had occurred at the exact moment when the system was supposed to activate. Investigation proceeded quickly and the problem was soon discovered {{to be the result of}} a malfunction in the pitch rate <b>gyro</b> <b>amplifier.</b> A diode intended to protect the system from transient voltages was thought to have been damaged during repairs/installation of the pitch amplifier's printed circuit board, something that would not have been detected through bench tests.|$|E
5000|$|To fix these problems, the Sperry A-5 {{autopilot}} was developed. This was {{the first}} all electric autopilot. This new autopilot used three dual-element vacuum tube <b>amplifiers</b> and high-speed <b>gyros.</b> Each <b>amplifier</b> {{was associated with a}} different axis: Yaw, pitch, and roll. The high-speed gyros were more sensitive and established a base reference level of the aircraftâ€™s level flight path. Whenever the aircraft deviated from the base reference level, the autopilot adjusted for {{the amount of time that}} occurred between the changes in reference levels. This allowed the autopilot to detect the velocity and acceleration of the change. The calculated change was then communicated quickly to the control surfaces by independent electro-hydraulic servos. This led to faster, more stable corrections of the aircraft.|$|R
