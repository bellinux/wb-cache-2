They can march better than any company in the National Guard, and they can play 'follow my leader' better than the entire Democratic party. Their voices don't amount to much, but I like to hear 'em. They wake you up a dozen times a night, but there's a homely sound about their quacking that is more musical to me than the cry of 'Fresh strawber-rees!' under your window {{in the morning when}} you want to sleep.|$|E
50|$|However, {{from the}} very {{beginning}} the reserve was plagued by a number of serious problems: dredging and calcification of the water-bed, bulrush harvesting, the building of a <b>duck-farm</b> and poisoned baits for suppressing vermin at a nearby pheasantry. As if this catalogue of small disasters was not enough, oil spilled into the reserve from a neighbouring agricultural facility which releases its wastes into the water as a matter of course. Turtles were wiped out in the part of the reserve stricken by this contamination. Despite this, in 1986 Dr. Jozef Voskar registered a dynamic population of all age categories in the undamaged areas.|$|E

6000|$|I did {{not leave}} town that summer. I usually went down to a village on the south shore of Long Island. The place was {{surrounded}} by <b>duck-farms,</b> and the ducks and dogs and whippoorwills and rusty windmills made so much noise that I could sleep as peacefully as if I were in my own flat six doors from the elevated railroad in New York. But that summer I did not go. Remember that. One of my friends asked me why I did not. I replied: ...|$|R

I suppose {{she thought the}} first person she inquired of would say: 'George Brown?--why, yes--lemme see--he's a short man with light-blue eyes, ain't he? Oh yes--you'll find George on One Hundred and Twenty-fifth Street, {{right next to the}} grocery. He's bill-clerk in a saddle-and-harness store.' That's about how {{innocent}} and beautiful she is. You know those little Long Island water-front villages like Greenburg--a couple of <b>duck-farms</b> for sport, and clams and about nine summer visitors for industries. That's the kind of a place she comes from. But, say--you ought to see her! ...|$|R
5000|$|In 1937, Martin Maurer {{moved the}} {{building}} four miles (6 km) southeast to Flanders, where it occupied a prominent location near the duck barns and marshes of Maurer's new duck ranch. The entire area, including Flanders and Riverhead, {{was the center}} of Long Island's well-known <b>duck-farming</b> industry. By 1939 there were about 90 duck farms in Suffolk County.The Big Duck's unusual building and prime location helped garner much customer attention until it closed in 1984. In 1988, Suffolk County acquired The Big Duck and moved it to Route 24 on the edge of Sears-Bellows Pond County Park between Flanders and Hampton Bays on the eastern part of Long Island. The building houses a gift shop operated by the Friends for Long Island Heritage. In 2004, there was a movement to move the duck to Long Island MacArthur Airport, but the duck was returned to its Flanders location on October 6, 2007. [...] Suffolk County continues to own it, maintains its interior and pays for staffing; Southampton Town maintains the exterior. The original 27 acre duck farm was purchased by the town in 2006.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background From April 2010 to January 2011, {{a severe}} new viral disease had devastated most <b>duck-farming</b> regions in China. This disease {{affected}} not only laying ducks but also meat ducks, causing huge economic losses for the poultry industry. The {{objective of this}} study is to develop a one-step reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification (RT-LAMP) assay for the detection of the new virus related to Tembusu-related Flavivirus. Results The RT-LAMP assay is very simple and rapid, and the amplification can be completed within 50 min under isothermal conditions at 63 °C by a set of 6 primers targeting the E gene based on the sequences analysis of the newly isolated viruses and other closely related Flavivirus. The monitoring of gene amplification can also be visualized by using SYBR green I fluorescent dye. In addition, the RT-LAMP assay for newly isolated Tembusu-related Flavivirus showed higher sensitivity with an RNA detection-limit of 2 copies/μL compared with 190 copies/μL of the conventional RT-PCR method. The specificity was identified without cross reaction to other common avian pathogens. By screening a panel of clinical samples this method was more feasible in clinical settings and there was higher positive coincidence rate than conventional RT-PCR and virus isolation. Conclusion The RT-LAMP assay for newly isolated Tembusu-related Flavivirus is a valuable tool for the rapid and real-time detection not only in well-equipped laboratories but also in general conditions. </p...|$|R
