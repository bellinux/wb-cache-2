5|$|In adults, {{the initial}} {{treatment}} for paracetamol overdose is gastrointestinal <b>decontamination.</b> Paracetamol absorption from the gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so <b>decontamination</b> is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal <b>decontamination</b> procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|For the Chemical Troops (Nebeltruppen) each <b>decontamination</b> battery (Entgiftungs-Batterie) was {{authorized}} six Sd.Kfz. 10/1 and six Sd.Kfz. 10/2. Eighteen Sd.Kfz. 10/3 {{were held at}} the battalion level for issue to the batteries in lieu of their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s if needed. If necessary they could be substituted for Sd.Kfz. 11s of the appropriate type. When the <b>decontamination</b> units were authorized to be re-equipped with heavy rocket launchers in November 1941 seven Sd.Kfz. 10/1s were used to tow the 28/32 cm Nebelwerfer 41 launchers and another {{was used by the}} platoon leader to tow an anti-tank gun. Similarly <b>decontamination</b> units usually retained their Sd.Kfz. 10/2s and used them just like the 10/1s after removing their special equipment. However, it seems that the 10/3s were turned in when the unit was reorganized.|$|E
5|$|Following test Baker <b>decontamination</b> problems, the United States Navy {{equipped}} newly constructed {{ships with}} a CounterMeasure WashDown System (CMWDS) of piping and nozzles to cover exterior {{surfaces of the}} ship with a spray of salt water from the firefighting system when nuclear attack appeared imminent. The film of flowing water would theoretically prevent contaminants from settling into cracks and crevices.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, the {{department}} retired and traded in its 1999 ambulance when purchasing its 2016 replacement. The following year, {{the department}} retired its 1991 pumper and a mass casualty <b>decontamination</b> unit trailer acquired through a Federal Emergency Management Agency grant, donating {{the latter to}} the New York Guard.|$|E
5|$|In June 2011, a {{ceremony}} {{was held at}} Da Nang airport to mark the start of U.S.-funded <b>decontamination</b> of dioxin hotspots in Vietnam. Thirty-two million dollars {{has so far been}} allocated by the U.S. Congress to fund the program.|$|E
5|$|Inducing {{vomiting}} with syrup of ipecac has {{no role in}} paracetamol overdose {{because the}} vomiting it induces delays the effective administration of activated charcoal and oral acetylcysteine. Liver injury is extremely rare after acute accidental ingestion in children under 6 years of age. Children with accidental exposures do not require gastrointestinal <b>decontamination</b> with either gastric lavage, activated charcoal, or syrup of ipecac.|$|E
5|$|Lieutenant Reed (Dominic Keating) and Ensign Mayweather (Anthony Montgomery) {{play chess}} {{while serving as}} hosts to non-corporeal aliens. Returning from an away mission on the planet below, Commander Tucker (Connor Trinneer) and Ensign Sato (Linda Park) soon exhibit {{symptoms}} of a strange disease. Upon examination by Doctor Phlox (John Billingsley), it {{is found to be}} a highly contagious silicon-based virus, and Captain Archer (Scott Bakula) explains that Commander T'Pol (Jolene Blalock) and Phlox are seeking a cure. To pass the time, while isolated in <b>Decontamination,</b> the two try to learn more about each other.|$|E
5|$|Preliminary care {{consists}} of gastric <b>decontamination</b> with either activated carbon or gastric lavage. However, {{due to the}} delay between ingestion and the first symptoms of poisoning, it is commonplace for patients to arrive for treatment long after ingestion, potentially reducing the efficacy of these interventions. Supportive measures are directed towards treating the dehydration which results from fluid loss during the gastrointestinal phase of intoxication and correction of metabolic acidosis, hypoglycemia, electrolyte imbalances, and impaired coagulation.|$|E
5|$|When PermaGrain went bankrupt, about 100,000curies of cobalt-60 were {{abandoned}} at the reactor facility, {{which was now}} {{under the control of}} Pennsylvania's government. The DEP assumed responsibility for the NRC license and legacy contamination. The United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), working with the NRC and state, removed the cobalt-60 from the site for disposal at the low-level radioactive waste facility in Barnwell, South Carolina in September 2003. Scientech continued <b>decontamination</b> work and demolished the hot cells; much of this work was done robotically, with financial aid from the Department of Energy.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, Albright and Wilson built a {{chemical}} {{works on the}} opposite side of the dock from the power stations. The chemical works produced white phosphorus from phosphate rock imported, through the docks, into the UK. Phosphate rock was stored in concrete silos on the dockside until it was required. Electricity provided by the local power stations was used to run six 7.5megawatt electric arc furnaces (45MW total) that reduced the phosphate rock. The phosphorus was then moved in sealed railway tanks to Oldbury and to Kirkby. After the closure of the factory the <b>decontamination</b> included the removal of yellow (spontaneously combustible) and red allotropes of phosphorus. The site is now home to Portishead volunteer coastguard.|$|E
5|$|The EMS {{command post}} {{was set up}} almost {{immediately}} following the attack and oversaw triage, treatment, transportation, and <b>decontamination.</b> A simple plan/objective was established: treatment and transportation of the injured was to be done as quickly as possible, supplies and personnel to handle {{a large number of}} patients was needed immediately, the dead needed to be moved to a temporary morgue until they could be transferred to the coroner's office, and measures for a long-term medical operation needed to be established. The triage center was set up near the Murrah Building and all the wounded were directed there. Two hundred and ten patients were transported from the primary triage center to nearby hospitals within the first couple hours following the bombing.|$|E
5|$|The Orions {{are placed}} under {{guard in the}} <b>decontamination</b> chamber. Harrad-Sar returns in his vessel and attacks the now {{disabled}} Enterprise, and then begins to tow it away. He reveals that, in fact, the Syndicate seeks Archer's head, and in this matter he is the slave and the Orion women are his masters. The Orions escape and travel to the Bridge, as do T'Pol and Tucker. Navaar tells Archer to arrest T'Pol, but Tucker stuns all the male crew-members with his phaser, and T'Pol disables the Orion ship with a pulse sent from Enterprise deflector dish. They send the Orions back to their ship, and T'Pol finally admits she would personally like Tucker to return, and he replies that he has already requested a transfer back to Enterprise.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} initial treatment for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric <b>decontamination</b> {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal <b>decontamination.</b> Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is mainly}} supportive; gastric <b>decontamination</b> with {{activated}} charcoal {{may be beneficial}} if medical attention is sought {{within a few hours}} of consumption. However, symptoms often take longer than this to develop, and patients do not usually present for treatment until many hours after ingestion, thus limiting its effectiveness. Patients with severe vomiting or diarrhea can be rehydrated with intravenous fluids. Monitoring of biochemical parameters such as methemoglobin levels, electrolytes, liver and kidney function, urinalysis, and complete blood count is undertaken and any abnormalities are corrected. Dialysis can be used if kidney function is impaired or the kidneys are failing. Hemolysis may require a blood transfusion to replace the lost red blood cells, while methemoglobinemia is treated with intravenous methylene blue.|$|E
5|$|Unmanned {{boats were}} the first vessels to enter the lagoon. Onboard {{instruments}} allowed remote-controlled radiation measurements to be made. When support ships entered the lagoon for evaluation, <b>decontamination,</b> and salvage activities, they steered clear of lagoon water hot spots detected by the drone boats. The standard for radiation exposure to personnel {{was the same as}} that used by the Manhattan Project: 0.1 roentgens per day. Because of this constraint, only the five most distant target ships could be boarded on the first day. The closer-in ships were hosed down by Navy fireboats using saltwater and flame retardants. The first hosing reduced radioactivity by half, but subsequent hosings were ineffective. For most of the ships, reboarding had to wait until the short-lived radioisotopes decayed; ten days elapsed before the last of the targets could be boarded.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' infection is ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a <b>decontamination</b> chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E
5|$|In July 2007, {{a report}} by Waterman Environmental was publicised by Councillor Craig, which {{revealed}} that the land upon which the Abbey Mills Mosque would be built is considered to have a medium-to-high contamination risk. The site {{was used as a}} chemical works for at least 100years, and was decommissioned as such in the late 1980s. Craig was alleged to have obtained this information under the Freedom of Information Act 2000, and he called for the Environment Agency to be brought in and for the site to be shut down until an independent report was undertaken. According to Craig, the Waterman Report revealed that the original pre-remediation works had discovered soil and groundwater impact by mercury, lead, arsenic, oil, fuels, and asbestos fibres. There were methane and carbon dioxide land gas readings as well. Mosque officials have stated that allowing the development to proceed would benefit the community, as <b>decontamination</b> of the site is part of their building plan.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and formaldehyde treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion <b>decontamination</b> relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
5|$|It {{appears that}} the most benefit from {{activated}} charcoal is gained if it is given within 30 minutes to two hours of ingestion. Administering activated charcoal later than 2 hours can be considered in patients that may have delayed gastric emptying due to co-ingested drugs or following ingestion of sustained- or delayed-release paracetamol preparations. Activated charcoal should also be administered if co-ingested drugs warrant <b>decontamination.</b> There was reluctance to give activated charcoal in paracetamol overdose, because of the concern that it may also absorb the oral antidote acetylcysteine. Studies have shown that 39% less acetylcysteine is absorbed into the body when they are administered together. There are conflicting recommendations regarding whether to change the dosing of oral acetylcysteine after the administration of activated charcoal, and even whether the dosing of acetylcysteine needs to be altered at all. Intravenous acetylcystine has no interaction with activated charcoal.|$|E
5|$|Management {{is based}} {{primarily}} on stopping the usage of the precipitating drugs, the administration of serotonin antagonists such as cyproheptadine, and supportive care including the control of agitation, the control of autonomic instability, and the control of hyperthermia. Additionally, those who ingest large doses of serotonergic agents may benefit from gastrointestinal <b>decontamination</b> with activated charcoal {{if it can be}} administered within an hour of overdose. The intensity of therapy depends on the severity of symptoms. If the symptoms are mild, treatment may only consist of discontinuation of the offending medication or medications, offering supportive measures, giving benzodiazepines for myoclonus, and waiting for the symptoms to resolve. Moderate cases should have all thermal and cardiorespiratory abnormalities corrected and can benefit from serotonin antagonists. The serotonin antagonist cyproheptadine is the recommended initial therapy, although there have been no controlled trials demonstrating its efficacy for serotonin syndrome. Despite the absence of controlled trials, {{there are a number of}} case reports detailing apparent improvement after people have been administered cyproheptadine. Animal experiments also suggest a benefit from serotonin antagonists. Cyproheptadine is only available as tablets and therefore can only be administered orally or via a nasogastric tube; it is unlikely to be effective in people administered activated charcoal and has limited use in severe cases. Additional pharmacological treatment for severe case includes administering atypical antipsychotic drugs with serotonin antagonist activity such as olanzapine. Critically ill people should receive the above therapies as well as sedation or neuromuscular paralysis. People who have autonomic instability such as low blood pressure require treatment with direct-acting sympathomimetics such as epinephrine, norepinephrine, or phenylephrine. Conversely, hypertension or tachycardia can be treated with short-acting antihypertensive drugs such as nitroprusside or esmolol; longer acting drugs such as propranolol should be avoided as they may lead to hypotension and shock. The cause of serotonin toxicity or accumulation is an important factor in determining the course of treatment. Serotonin is catabolized by monoamine oxidase in the presence of oxygen, so if care is taken to prevent an unsafe spike in body temperature or metabolic acidosis, oxygenation will assist in dispatching the excess serotonin. The same principle applies to alcohol intoxication. In cases of serotonin syndrome caused by monoamine oxidase inhibitors oxygenation will not help to dispatch serotonin. In such instances, hydration is the main concern until the enzyme is regenerated.|$|E
25|$|To {{enhance the}} <b>decontamination</b> {{capabilities}} of the Force, these PLs have been retrofitted with the necessary accessories to set up Hasty <b>Decontamination</b> of casualties in a chemical incident.

25|$|Mobile <b>Decontamination</b> System: {{with the}} NBC {{aspect of the}} {{battlefield}} in mind, the DRDO developed a Tatra vehicle based Mobile <b>Decontamination</b> system for <b>decontamination</b> of personnel, clothing, equipment, vehicles & terrain during war. The main sub-systems of mobile <b>decontamination</b> system are: pre-wash, chemical wash and post wash systems respectively. The pre-wash system consists of a 3000-litre stainless steel water tank and a fast suction pump. A high-pressure jet with a capacity of 3400 l/hour and a low-pressure jet with a capacity of 900 l/hour and 1600 l/hour are included. The chemical wash system is capable of mixing two powders and two liquids with variable feed rates and has a five-litre per minute slurry emulsion flow rate. The post wash system consists of a high-pressure hot water jet, a hot water shower for personnel and provision of steam for <b>decontamination</b> of clothing. The <b>decontamination</b> systems have been introduced into the services. The system is under production for the Army at DRDO's partnering firms, with the DRDO itself manufacturing the pilot batch.|$|E
25|$|Treatment of a {{recently}} ingested poison may involve gastric <b>decontamination</b> to decrease absorption. Gastric <b>decontamination</b> can involve activated charcoal, gastric lavage, whole bowel irrigation, or nasogastric aspiration. Routine use of emetics (syrup of Ipecac), cathartics or laxatives {{are no longer}} recommended.|$|E
25|$|A {{subcontractor}} employee was contaminated on his face, {{head and}} chest while transferring {{water from the}} damaged tank.
