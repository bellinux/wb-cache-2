5|$|Minimum {{processing}} requirements {{also became}} {{an issue in the}} Canada-European Union Comprehensive Economic Trade Agreement (CETA). Dunderdale announced {{in a speech to the}} St. John's Board of Trade in May 2013, that the loan <b>guarantee</b> for the Muskrat Falls project nearly fell apart because of MPRs. She said that the federal government tried to pressure her into eliminating MPRs at the eleventh hour of the loan <b>guarantee</b> negotiations to help secure the trade deal. Dunderdale said that while she was willing to look at minimum processing requirements, she was not willing to tie it to the loan <b>guarantee.</b>|$|E
5|$|One of {{the major}} focuses of Dunderdale's premiership has been the {{development}} of {{the first phase of the}} Lower Churchill Project—Muskrat Falls. Several weeks before becoming premier, Dunderdale along with Williams and Premier Dexter of Nova Scotia, signed a partnership agreement to develop the multibillion-dollar hydro development. During her first official meeting with Prime Minister Stephen Harper on February 1, 2011, Dunderdale asked for his government's support with a loan <b>guarantee</b> for Muskrat Falls. The loan <b>guarantee</b> would reduce the cost of the project by millions, resulting in lower electricity rates for consumers. Dunderdale's first throne speech as premier was read out by Lieutenant Governor Crosbie on March 21, 2011, and there was significant focus placed on the Lower Churchill development. During a campaign stop in St. John's during the 2011 federal election Dunderdale endorsed Harper and his Conservative Party while Harper committed to the loan <b>guarantee.</b> On August 19, 2011, Canada's Natural Resources Minister Joe Oliver announced a Memorandum of Agreement for the loan <b>guarantee.</b> While Oliver stated the loan <b>guarantee</b> would be in place by the end of November 2011, it was not until November 30, 2012 that the loan <b>guarantee</b> was finalized. In a simultaneous news conference held in St. John's and Halifax on December 17, 2012, Dunderdale and Emera Inc. announced they had both officially sanctioned the Muskrat Falls hydro development.|$|E

Besides a valuation assuming that the policyholder follows a given strategy with respect to surrender and withdrawals, we are able to price the contract under optimal policyholder behavior.
