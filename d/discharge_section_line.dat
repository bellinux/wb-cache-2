The {{approach}} section walls contract uniformly at a 3:1 ratio, while the <b>discharge</b> <b>section</b> walls expand at a 6:1 ratio.

50|$|The Montana flume omits {{the throat}} and <b>discharge</b> <b>sections</b> of the Parshall. By omitting these sections, the flume is {{shortened}} by more than half, while retaining the free-flow characteristics of the same-size Parshall. With the deletion of {{the throat and}} <b>discharge</b> <b>section,</b> the Montana flume has little resistance to submersion and, like the H flume, should be used where free-spilling discharge is present under all flow conditions. The Montana flume is described in US Bureau of Reclamation's Water Measurement Manual and two technical standards MT199127AG and MT199128AG by Montana State University (note that Montana State University has currently withdrawn both standards for updating/review).|$|R
50|$|Differences {{between the}} Venturi and Parshall flume include: {{reduction}} of the inlet converging angle, lengthening the throat section, {{reduction of the}} discharge divergence angle, and introducing a drop through the throat (and subsequent partial recovery in the <b>discharge</b> <b>section).</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Ship sailing {{resistance}} {{is an important}} index of cross section size optimization of restricted channel. Through real ship experiment with one typical ship in inland restricted channel, the relationship between ship sailing resistance and factors such as water depth to draft ratio, <b>discharge</b> <b>section</b> area and so on is studied. And modified calculation formula of ship sailing {{resistance is}} put forward. The results show that as water depth to draft ratio decreases, or <b>discharge</b> <b>section</b> area becomes smaller, ship sailing resistance will increase significantly. By introducing two parameters: section blockage ratio and water depth to draft ratio, the Zivankov formula of ship sailing resistance calculation is modified, and the calculation accuracy which the modified formula applied in restricted channel has greatly improved...|$|R

5000|$|Range {{roads are}} {{commonly}} numbered in one-mile (1.6-km) increments west {{from the east}} range line of a given township. The range roads form {{the east and west}} boundaries (known as <b>Section</b> <b>Lines)</b> of the 1 mile x 1 mile square sections - 36 of which comprise a township (e.g. Range Road 12-2 would be between the second and third sections west of Range line 12, Range Road 6-0 is on Range line 6). In many counties, the dash between the range line number and the <b>section</b> <b>line</b> number is eliminated (Range Road 15-1 (151) might be called [...] "Range Road one-fifty-one"). Where a township road offset from a <b>section</b> <b>line,</b> it is often appended with a letter (Range Road 11-1A is just west of the first <b>section</b> <b>line</b> west of Range line 11). This system is useful for finding farmsteads (assuming one knows the legal address of the parcel).|$|R

5000|$|The {{basic idea}} of the system was {{inspired}} by the existing address system used in many towns where streets and avenues are numbered outwards from a starting [...] "main street" [...] near the center of town. To number rural <b>section</b> <b>line</b> roads in the state the rough geographical centerlines of the state were designated as [...] "Main Street" [...] (running east-west) and [...] "Main Avenue" [...] (running north-south). Roads are assigned an increasing number moving out from these centerlines with the number of the road determined by the number of miles it is from the corresponding centerline. For roads on half <b>section</b> <b>lines</b> an M is added to the road name and for quarter <b>section</b> <b>lines</b> an F is added.|$|R

50|$|<b>Section</b> <b>lines</b> in the United States are {{one mile}} (1.6 km) apart. When {{surveyors}} originally mapped an area, for instance a township, {{it was their}} custom to divide the new township into 36 1 sq mi. Property ownership often followed this layout. A section is a 1-by-1 mi area. A half section is a 1/2-mile by 1-mile area. It is proper to continue this division down to a 1/4-by-1/4 section which is 1/16 of a section, or 40 acre. The next smaller division is 10 acre, and then 2.5 acre. Besides property ownership, roads called <b>section</b> <b>line</b> roads often followed the <b>section</b> <b>lines,</b> and one can often still see them in modern maps, even in urban areas. In rural areas, these roads are called section roads, and often exist primarily so that farmers can access their land.|$|R

The highway was constructed along its current route near Oronoque concurrent {{with the construction}} of the Norton Reservoir (now Keith Sebelius Lake) on Prairie Dog Creek around 1962. The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials approved the removal of the US-383 designation in 1979. K-383 was assigned to the portions of former US-383 in Kansas from US-83 near Selden to a concurrency with US-183 at the Nebraska state line in 1981. In 1990, K-383's western terminus was {{relocated to}} its present spot.

US-83 followed the <b>section</b> <b>line</b> road to near what was then K-23's northern terminus, then turned north along another <b>section</b> <b>line</b> road and passed under K-383 and the Kyle Railroad; a connector ramp was used between US-83 and K-383 at the bridges, which were constructed by 1951. US-83 was relocated to remove the grade separations and both K-383 and K-23 were given their present termini; the eastwest <b>section</b> <b>line</b> road west of K-23 was transferred to county maintenance.
