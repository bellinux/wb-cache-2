5|$|The {{oxidizer}} {{and fuel}} preburners are welded to the hot-gas manifold. The fuel and oxidizer enter the preburners and are mixed so that efficient combustion can occur. The augmented spark igniter {{is a small}} combination chamber located {{in the center of}} the injector of each preburner. The two dual-redundant spark igniters, which are activated by the engine controller, are used during the engine start sequence to initiate combustion in each preburner. They are turned off after approximately three seconds because the combustion process is then self-sustaining. The preburners produce the fuel-rich hot gases that pass through the turbines to generate the power needed to operate the high-pressure turbopumps. The oxidizer preburner's outflow <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> turbine that is connected to the HPOTP and to the oxidizer preburner pump. The fuel preburner's outflow <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> turbine that is connected to the HPFTP.|$|E

As the video progresses, she parks her car on the side of the road and scenes from the original version are shown. Police dogs eventually catch Ealy's character and attack him savagely.

The stunt team built a model and put forward several ways in which the digger could conceivably take out the concrete, including taking out the pillar underneath. A section of the concrete wall was removed to fit the digger and reinforced with steel.|$|E
5|$|Geothermal {{energy is}} heat energy {{generated}} {{and stored in}} the Earth. Thermal energy is the energy that determines the temperature of matter. The geothermal energy of the Earth's crust originates from the original formation of the planet and from radioactive decay of materials (in currently uncertain but possibly roughly equal proportions). The geothermal gradient, which is the difference in temperature between {{the core of the}} planet and its surface, <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> continuous conduction of thermal energy in the form of heat from the core to the surface. The adjective geothermal originates from the Greek roots γη (ge), meaning earth, and θερμος (thermos), meaning hot.|$|E

An annular combustor is a continuous ring where fuel is {{injected into the}} airflow and ignited, raising the pressure and temperature of the flow. Other types of combustors include can combustors, where each combustion chamber is separate, and canannular which is a hybrid of the two. Fuel injection is regulated by a Hydromechanical Unit (HMU), built by Honeywell. The HMU regulates the amount of fuel delivered to the engine {{by means of an}} electrohydraulic servo valve that, in turn, <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> fuel metering valve, that provides information to the full authority digital engine controller (FADEC).|$|E
5|$|Producer Frank Marshall {{stated in}} 2003 {{that the film}} would use {{traditional}} stunt work {{so as to be}} consistent with the previous films. CGI was used to remove the visible safety wires on the actors when they did their stunts (such as when Indy swings on a lamp with his whip). Timed explosives were used for a scene where Indiana <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> truck through crates. During the take, an explosive failed to detonate and landed in the seat beside Ford.

5|$|Because of {{the immense}} {{distances}} of most gamma-ray burst sources from Earth, {{identification of the}} progenitors, the systems that produce these explosions, is challenging. The association of some long GRBs with supernovae {{and the fact that}} their host galaxies are rapidly star-forming offer very strong evidence that long gamma-ray bursts are associated with massive stars. The most widely accepted mechanism for the origin of long-duration GRBs is the collapsar model, in which the core of an extremely massive, low-metallicity, rapidly rotating star collapses into a black hole {{in the final stages of}} its evolution. Matter near the star's core rains down towards the center and swirls into a high-density accretion disk. The infall of this material into a black hole <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> pair of relativistic jets out along the rotational axis, which pummel through the stellar envelope and eventually break through the stellar surface and radiate as gamma rays. Some alternative models replace the black hole with a newly formed magnetar, although most other aspects of the model (the collapse of the core of a massive star and the formation of relativistic jets) are the same.|$|E
5|$|Despite being {{known for}} his smoking character, Davis quit smoking in the 1970s; when The X-Files started up, {{he was given a}} choice between herbal {{cigarettes}} and tobacco cigarettes. At first, he chose to use tobacco cigarettes, but switched to herbal because he was afraid of becoming addicted to them again. Davis used his notoriety on the show to assist the Canadian Cancer Society in its programs to combat smoking. In 2014, Davis donated his investments that support fossil fuels to the David Suzuki Foundation in an effort to both ethically invest, and help fund work to fight climate change. Davis is a passionate advocate for action in response to climate change, believes it is a critical issue of our time and speaks on the subject often. Taking action on a personal level, Davis <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> Tesla powered by hydroelectricity.|$|E
5|$|Gran Trak 10 is an arcade game {{developed}} by Atari through its subsidiary Cyan Engineering, and released by Atari in May 1974. In the game, a single player <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> car along a race track, viewed from above, avoiding walls of pylons {{and trying to}} pass as many checkpoints as possible before time runs out. The game is controlled with a steering wheel, accelerator and brake pedals, and a gear stick, and the car crashes and spins if it hits a pylon. Gran Trak 10 began development in fall of 1973; it was initially designed by Larry Emmons of Cyan, with the mechanical design handled by Eigen Systems, though after several design and production problems were uncovered during an initial small production run in March 1974 the design was overhauled by Allan Alcorn, the designer of Pong, with wider distribution beginning in May. The game's circuits include possibly the first instance of integrated circuit-based read-only memory, rather than graphics storied in diodes, which thereafter became the standard for arcade games.|$|E

The filmmakers can change the film based on the audiences' reactions. The film is enjoyed by everyone but Homer. During the screening, Gibson, having come to the test screening unannounced, is assured by the producers that the film is wonderful. While reading the comment cards after the movie, Gibson is certain that everyone loves him too much to tell him how to improve the film. When he reads Homer's comments, he thinks that Homer was the only person brave enough to tell him the truth.|$|E
5|$|Kingsley Amis, in The James Bond Dossier, {{noted that}} {{although}} Bond {{is a very}} good shot and the best in the Secret Service, he is still beaten by the instructor, something that added realism to Bond's character. Amis identified a number of skills where Bond is very good, but is still beatable by others. These included skiing, hand-to-hand combat, underwater swimming and golf. Driving was also an ability Amis identified where Bond was good, but others were better; one of those who is a better driver than Bond is Sir Hugo Drax, who causes Bond to write off his battleship-grey supercharged Bentley 4½ Litre. Bond subsequently <b>drives</b> <b>a</b> Mark II Continental Bentley, which he uses in the remaining books of the series, although he is issued an Aston Martin DB Mark III with a homing device during the course of Goldfinger.|$|E
