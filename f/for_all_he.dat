5|$|The {{game was}} {{directed}} and written by Shu Takumi {{as the last}} game in an Ace Attorney trilogy; he also {{wanted it to be}} the final entry in the series, as he felt he had explored Phoenix's character fully. Because he was satisfied with the gameplay in Justice <b>for</b> <b>All,</b> <b>he</b> did not introduce any new gameplay mechanics in Trials and Tribulations. Flashbacks were used as a major theme in the game; this originated in Takumi {{trying to come up with}} a way of handling dialogue-integrated tutorials, and deciding to use a flashback to a case from when Mia was a rookie attorney.|$|E
5|$|Harry learns from Snape's memories, {{that while}} Snape despised Harry's late father, James, who had bullied him, {{he loved his}} late mother, Lily. Following her death, Snape worked {{secretly}} with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his love for Lily. Harry also learns Dumbledore was dying and wanted Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe {{he saw in the}} woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry then surrenders himself to Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Harry then returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> fakes being dead, and Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort that Harry is dead after confirming that Draco is okay.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{was against}} the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, and {{supported}} free and accessible health insurance <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> also wanted to transfer ownership of corporations to the workers. When discussing the War on Terror, Moore felt it was destroying small communities throughout the country with higher taxes and more pressure on the local governments. Moore and Vice Presidential candidate Stewart Alexander supported a 50% reduction of the United States Department of Defense spending, and using the other 50% to improve veteran benefits. Alexander proposed that retired veterans with 10–30 years of military service should receive an income of $15–30 thousand annually from the state.|$|E

25|$|In 811, the Byzantine Emperor {{organised}} a large {{campaign to}} conquer Bulgaria once and <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> gathered an enormous army from the Anatolian and European themata, and the imperial bodyguard (the tagmata); {{they were joined}} by a number of irregular troops who expected a swift victory and plunder. The conquest was supposed to be easy, and most of the high-ranking officials and aristocrats accompanied him, including his son Stauracius and his brother-in-law Michael I Rangabe. The whole army consisted of around 80,000 soldiers.|$|E
25|$|Randolph was {{admired by}} the {{community}} and his supporters for his fiery character and {{was known as a}} man that was passionate about education and equality <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> applied rousing electioneering methods, which he also enjoyed as a hobby. Randolph appealed directly to yeomen, using entertaining and enlightening oratory, sociability, and community of interest, particularly in agriculture. This resulted in an enduring voter attachment to him regardless of his personal deficiencies. His defense of limited government appeals to modern and contemporary conservatives, most notably Russell Kirk (1918–1994).|$|E
25|$|His poems display {{neither the}} {{incoherence}} of nostalgia for some mentally palatable past nor, however vaguely charted, {{the possibility of}} the future. All he had was the present, which was not to his Muse’s liking, and eventually not to his own either. His poetry, in other words, is that of the here and now and of no escape, except for poetry itself. Yet <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> {{had to say about the}} present, his language is amazingly clear and direct, and the formal aspects of his verse are amazingly conservative. Evidently Kees did not feel the imperative of arrythmia so palpable among his less memorable peers, not to mention successors.|$|E

25|$|On the March 31, 2008 {{episode of}} Raw, Flair {{delivered}} his farewell address. Afterward, Triple H brought out many current and retired superstars to thank Flair <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> has done, including Shawn Michaels, {{some of the}} Four Horsemen, Harley Race, and Chris Jericho, followed by The Undertaker and then Vince McMahon. Along with the wrestlers, the fans gave Flair a standing ovation. This event represented a rare moment in WWE as both the heels and the faces broke character and {{came out to the}} ring together. Flair made his first post retirement appearance on the June 16, 2008 episode of Raw to confront Chris Jericho about his actions during a rivalry with Shawn Michaels. He challenged Jericho to a fight in the parking lot, rather than an official match, but was ejected from the building by Vince McMahon.|$|E
25|$|Although the Byzantines {{eventually}} {{managed to}} capture all of Bulgaria, Samuel resisted Basil II {{for decades and}} is the only man to ever defeat him in battle, when in 986 Samuel drove Basil II's army from the field at the Gates of Trajan, and the emperor (barely surviving the heavy defeat) soon turned to the east for new conquests. The victory by Samuel prompted Pope Gregory V to recognize him as Tsar, and he was crowned in Rome in 997. In 1002, a full-scale war broke out. By this time, Basil's army was stronger, and the emperor was determined to conquer Bulgaria once and <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> deployed much of the imperial army, battle-seasoned from the Eastern campaigns against the Arabs, and Samuel was forced to retreat into his country's heartland. Still, by harassing the powerful Byzantine army, Samuel hoped to force Basil to the peace table. For a dozen years, his tactics maintained Bulgarian independence and even kept Basil away from the main Bulgarian cities, including the capital of Ohrid.|$|E
25|$|Now {{that the}} Zand dynasty {{was no longer}} {{under the rule of}} Jafar Khan Zand, Agha Mohammad Khan saw an {{opportunity}} to capture Shiraz once and <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> marched towards the city, and as he neared it, was attacked by Lotf Ali Khan. A battle was fought on 25 June 1789, which ended in Lotf Ali Khan withdrawing to Shiraz while Agha Mohammad Khan followed him and besieged the city. The siege lasted until 7 September. He set up an encampment and returned to Tehran, where he stayed {{until the end of the}} ensuing Nowruz. On 17 May 1790, Agha Mohammad Khan once again marched towards Shiraz. When he reached Fars, the governor of Bihbahan acknowledged his authority. Lotf Ali Khan once again left Shiraz in order to stop Agha Mohammad Khan's advance, but the Qajar ruler withdrew to Qazvin and its surroundings, where he had to resolve some problems. Agha Mohammad Khan later quarreled with Jafar Qoli Khan, who saw himself as the best heir of the Qajar dynasty. Agha Mohammad had him executed, which he believed necessary having seen in the Zand family how quickly a dynasty could decline due to disputes over the throne.|$|E

25|$|The {{idea of the}} {{expected}} value originated {{in the middle of}} the 17th century from the study of the so-called problem of points, which seeks to divide the stakes in a fair way between two players who have to end their game before it's properly finished. This problem had been debated for centuries, and many conflicting proposals and solutions had been suggested over the years, when it was posed in 1654 to Blaise Pascal by French writer and amateur mathematician Chevalier de Méré. de Méré claimed that this problem couldn't be solved and that it showed just how flawed mathematics was when it came to its application to the real world. Pascal, being a mathematician, was provoked and determined to solve the problem once and <b>for</b> <b>all.</b> <b>He</b> began to discuss the problem in a now famous series of letters to Pierre de Fermat. Soon enough they both independently came up with a solution. They solved the problem in different computational ways but their results were identical because their computations were based on the same fundamental principle. The principle is that the value of a future gain should be directly proportional to the chance of getting it. This principle seemed to have come naturally to both of them. They were very pleased by the fact that they had found essentially the same solution and this in turn made them absolutely convinced they had solved the problem conclusively. However, they did not publish their findings. They only informed a small circle of mutual scientific friends in Paris about it.|$|E

Dawson added that some of Darren's actions were [...] "blatantly horrible" [...] although he felt that this made Darren [...] "such a fun character to play". Dawson also commented on Darren's [...] "luck with girls"; Dawson felt that Darren [...] "tends to take girls for granted" [...] and is [...] "out <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> can get". Dawson also called Darren [...] "an opportunist" [...] and a [...] "male chauvinist pig".|$|E

500|$|The {{greatest}} all-rounder of his era, Wills {{saw himself}} principally as a bowler. With a repertoire that included [...] "sparklers, rippers, fizzers, trimmers and shooters", he varied his pace and style considerably, and {{was quick to}} work out a batsman's weak points. Noted for his deceptive slow deliveries, dropping mid-flight and big on break, Wills' fast round arm balls sometimes reared head-high from the pitch, terrorising his opponent. English batsman Sir David Serjeant said that Wills was the only bowler he ever feared. He was known to carefully study an umpire before deciding whether to throw. A trickster, he would ask the umpire to watch his feet lest he go over the crease, and then [...] "let go a throw <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> was worth". His most flagrant throws were likened to that of a baseball pitcher.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Not Fade Away" [...] {{the finale}} of the series, Angel visits Connor for {{coffee on the}} eve of his final battle with the Circle of the Black Thorn.

When Angel fights Marcus Hamilton, Connor shows up to fight by his father's side (knowing that Angel wouldn't do something so innocuous unless the world were about to end), saving Angel from being staked by Hamilton and helping him gain the upper hand. As the Senior Partners begin to exact their vengeance, Angel tells Connor to go home to his foster parents and assures him that as long as Connor is safe, the Partners can never destroy Angel.|$|E

500|$|Trials and Tribulations {{was written}} and {{directed}} by Shu Takumi, with art by Tatsuro Iwamoto and music by Noriyuki Iwadare. After development of the original Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney was finished, Takumi's boss, Shinji Mikami, told him that they should make an Ace Attorney trilogy, with a grand finale in the third game's last case. As Takumi wanted the three first Ace Attorney games to be parts of a larger work, he avoided making a lot of changes: art for main characters such as Phoenix, Maya and Edgeworth was reused from the first game, to avoid having the previous games look outdated in comparison to newer games in the series; and no new gameplay mechanics were added for Trials and Tribulations, as Takumi was happy with the gameplay after having added the psyche-lock mechanic for Justice <b>for</b> <b>All.</b> <b>He</b> wanted the series to end with Trials and Tribulations, as he had explored Phoenix's character fully and wanted to avoid the series becoming [...] "a shadow of its former self", saying that he thinks {{it is important to know}} when to end a story.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after missing}} out on the program, Rhys finds himself {{performing}} surgery on Chris Pappas (James Mason). Rhys initially treats Chris at the hospital after he is attacked at work by an unknown assailant. Chris refuses to stay for any further medical treatment and later collapses with a punctured lung. Barber said {{that as soon as}} Rhys sees Chris's X-rays, he [...] "goes beyond the call of duty" [...] to find him. The actor explained [...] "When he finds him on the floor, he knows exactly what's happened, but he isn't sure how long he's been unconscious for. <b>For</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> knows, Chris could be dead within the minute— so he goes straight into emergency mode." [...] In a bid to save Chris's life, Rhys performs an emergency procedure to get him breathing again using a screwdriver and a piece of piping. Rhys should not be conducting any type of surgery as he is not a qualified surgeon, but he does not think of the consequences. All About Soap's Laura Morgan said Rhys' [...] "quick thinking" [...] pays off and Chris starts breathing again, but at the hospital Karl warns him he will be held accountable if Chris does not pull through.|$|E
500|$|Roger Newcomb and Matt Richenthal, {{writing for}} {{websites}} We Love Soaps and TV Fanatic respectively, both described {{the decision to}} replace Russ with Nichols as surprising. Allison Waldman of AOL TV said the recast was [...] "bad news", as Russ was [...] "doing just fine as Tucker McCall, new billionaire in Genoa City". However, she also wrote that the role would be [...] "better suited" [...] for Nichols with Tucker becoming more of a [...] "romantic figure". Tara Blake of TVSource speculated that the character would be tied to a [...] "major Genoa City player" [...] {{and that was the}} reason for the recast. Gwen Morrett of About.com said that Nichols joining The Young and the Restless was [...] "truly their gain" [...] from Days of Our Lives (where the actor had previously portrayed Steve Johnson). Upon Nichols' debut, Megan Lynn of SoapNet wrote: [...] "Stephen certainly has soap experience — he's previously played Steve Johnson on Days of our Lives and Stefan Cassadine on General Hospital, but then again — we were kind of warming up to William." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote of the decision to hire Nichols onto the series: [...] "This week, daytime fans get one of their wishes, to see Stephen Nichols back on daytime. From his role as Stefan on GH to Patch on DAYS, you know that Stephen Nichols is going to play Tucker <b>for</b> <b>all</b> <b>he</b> is worth, and then some." [...] In August 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote of Nichols' portrayal, saying: [...] "Now going into the 21st century, Stephen has reinvented another part of himself and inhabits Genoa City as the town’s newest and most handsome billionaire on CBS’s number-one daytime drama The Young and the Restless." ...|$|E
