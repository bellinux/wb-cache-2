5|$|Lucas {{was born}} on November 3, 1982 in Oklahoma. He attends Smith College, a private, women-only college in Massachusetts. Lucas is a {{neuroscience}} major in his senior year; he has fought for transgender rights for his entire college career. He has not yet started hormone replacement therapy, and is cautious about it. Lucas' parents are divorced; his mother and brother <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is trans, but his father does not. Lucas plays guitar in a punk band, and lives in an apartment with his friend Kasey, a trans {{man who has been}} on HRT for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Most {{moments in}} which there is a fantastic {{occurrence}} constitute a change in point of view, from the omniscient narrator to a specific character with particular beliefs. The introduction of magical events from the perspective of the slaves highlights their otherness, because while they may believe, for instance, that Macandal survived his execution, the whites, and especially the readers, <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> did not. The marvellous, emphasized in the Prologue, is a product of the characters' beliefs, which is why there is the shift in perspectives when presenting it.|$|E
5|$|Æthelbert was {{instrumental}} in forming a library at York, which was probably the largest contemporary collection of books {{to be found in}} Europe outside of Rome. Alcuin mentions several Latin and Greek classical authors, as well as the Fathers and other Christian writers that formed the 8th century canon. Æthelbert, in his search for books, travelled far, and we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> visited Rome among other places. Alcuin's poem Versus lists 41 different authors, including some who wrote in Hebrew. He taught both the trivium as well as the quadrivium, plus how to figure the dates of church festivals and natural science.|$|E

5|$|Black {{comes to}} in a {{hospital}} bed, tended to by his wife Catherine Black (Megan Gallagher). She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before they even arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
5|$|His brother Manuel Silvestre Alberti {{signed the}} popular {{petition}} formulated on 25 May that aimed to draft {{the composition of}} the Primera Junta that would replace Cisneros in power. On that day Alberti moved to Azcuénaga's house and from it he observed the events in the plaza, along with many other patriots gathered there. He was there when he came to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was chosen {{as a member of the}} new Junta. The reasons of Alberti's inclusion in the Junta are unclear, as with all its members. A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists, and Alberti in particular may have been elected to serve as chaplain of the government.|$|E
5|$|Less {{is known}} of his life. Art historians associating the Dombild Master with the {{historical}} Stefan Lochner believe {{he was born in}} Meersburg in south-west Germany around 1410, and that he spent some of his apprenticeship in the Low Countries. Records indicate that his career developed quickly but was cut short by an early death. We <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was commissioned around 1442 by the Cologne council to provide decorations for the visit of Emperor Frederick III, a major city occasion. Records from the following years indicate growing wealth and the purchase of a number of properties around the city. Thereafter he seems to have over-extended his finances and fallen into debt. Plague hit Cologne in 1451 and there, apart from the records of creditors, mention of Stephan Lochner ends; it is presumed he died that year, aged around 40.|$|E
60|$|And in {{that long}} kiss {{darkness}} came upon him again, and when again he was conscious <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was alone and <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to die. He was wearily glad <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was to die.|$|R
50|$|Little {{is known}} of Russell's postwar career. However, it is <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was {{transferred}} to the Royal Air Force's unemployed list on 24 February 1919. It is also <b>known</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> died in 1960.|$|R

5|$|Over {{the next}} few months, Day {{returned}} to moulding Sabrina to meet his requirements for the ideal woman, choosing what she would wear, and pushing his ideas of frugality upon her. Sabrina took on all the ideas willingly and Day believed he had finally created a woman who would meet all his requirements. He was so confident that he talked openly of marrying Sabrina, though she was unaware of his intentions. Eventually one of Day's friends let her <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> hoped to marry her. Sabrina confronted Day about the rumours and he admitted they were true, neglecting to mention that {{he had hoped to}} marry her since the day he met her.|$|E
5|$|As a {{marriage}} gift, the Tsar gave George {{a group of}} islands in the Petalioi Gulf, which the family visited on the royal yacht Amphitrite. George later purchased a country estate, Tatoi, north of Athens, and on Corfu he built a summer villa called Mon Repos. George developed Tatoi, building roads and planting grapes for making his own wine, Chateau Décélie. Intent on not letting his subjects <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> missed Denmark, he discreetly maintained a dairy at his palace at Tatoi, which was managed by native Danes {{and served as a}} bucolic reminder of his homeland. Queen Olga was far less careful in hiding her nostalgia for her native Russia, often visiting Russian ships at Piraeus two or three times before they weighed anchor. When alone with his wife, George usually conversed in German. Their children were taught English by their nannies, and when talking with his children he therefore spoke mainly English.|$|E
5|$|At Branga, Shiva {{learns that}} the only person aware of the {{medicine}} recipe is a bandit named Parashuram, who leads a secluded life and kills any man coming near his abode in the jungles. Shiva and his men defeat Parashuram, and to his surprise comes to <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is a Vasudev, the group of scholars who have been guiding him on his journey. Parashuram is also surprised to see Shiva as the fabled Neelkanth; in remorse for his actions, he severs his left hand. He gives the recipe of the medicine {{to the people of}} Branga and leaves for Kashi with Shiva. At Kashi, Shiva is introduced to Ganesh and Kali by Sati. Shiva recognizes Ganesh as the Naga who tried to attack on Sati and as the killer of Brahaspati. Severely angered, he leaves Sati and takes up residence at the Branga locality. One day, while playing with Kartik at a local park, three lions attack them and Ganesh becomes severely injured while saving Kartik. Shiva forgives him and together with Sati, confronts Daksha, who confesses to murdering Sati's first husband and denouncing Kali and Ganesh. Daksha blames Shiva for causing distrust between him and Sati, who disgusted with Daksha's deeds, asks him to leave Kashi and go back to Meluha.|$|E
60|$|And {{meanwhile}} <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{was under}} strict surveillance from Mr. Green; <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was watched wherever he went; {{and nothing but}} his confidence that no evidence could be produced against him allowed him to remain, as he did, all unconcerned of this.|$|R

60|$|Right {{then and}} there Whitefoot's heart was filled so full of {{something}} that {{it seemed as if}} it would burst. It was love. All in <b>that</b> instant <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had found the most wonderful thing in all the Great World, which of course is love. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> just couldn't live without little Miss Dainty.|$|R
5|$|The {{writer of}} the {{scenario}} is unknown, but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan. He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions. The plot was likened by Walton of The Moving Picture News to Enoch Arden, but the story differs in several ways. Published by Alfred, Lord Tennyson in 1864, the poem tells of the eponymous character who becomes shipwrecked on a desert island and returns home a decade later to find his wife has remarried {{and they have a}} new child. For the sake of his wife's happiness, he never lets her <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> is alive. The plot differs because the husband willingly fakes his death and returns {{on the day of the}} wedding. Rather than announce himself, he attempts to leave and dies in the process, his body is removed by the prospective husband before marrying her. The similarity with the poem comes from refusing to confront or interrupt the wedding by revealing the fact that he is alive is ensured by John's true death at the climax. The New York Dramatic Mirror noted that the journalists arrived to photograph and cover the apparent suicide too quickly, making it illogical that the fake suicide would not have been revealed.|$|E
25|$|Soldiers with uniforms {{showing the}} German flag, who {{identified}} themselves as German KSK, special forces, came to interrogate him. Kurnaz hoped {{they would have to}} make a report, which would let German authorities and eventually his family <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being held at Kandahar.|$|E
25|$|In Costa Rica, Zelaya {{told the}} pan-Latin American channel TeleSUR {{that he had}} been awakened by gunshots. Masked {{soldiers}} took his cell phone, shoved him into a van and took him to an air force base, where he was put on a plane. He said he did not <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was being taken to Costa Rica until he landed at the airport in San José.|$|E

60|$|You see it {{was this}} way: Reddy's wits were working very fast there in Farmer Brown's henhouse. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had only a forlorn chance of {{escaping}} when Farmer Brown's boy should come to open the henhouse in the morning. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> must {{make the most of}} <b>that</b> forlorn chance. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> freedom is a thousand times better than a full stomach.|$|R
25|$|Fitzy Fitzgerald (Cavan Cunningham) is {{the mayor}} of Dog River. He tends to take his {{position}} very seriously. He is quite paranoid about losing his job and thinks that anyone will do anything for the position of mayor, although no one really wants it. Not a lot is revealed about his personal life; however, we do <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{has at least one}} child, and several episodes imply that he may have a son.|$|E
25|$|By 1094, {{when he is}} attested in the synod that {{condemned}} Leo of Chalcedon, Opos {{had risen}} to the dignity of protoproedros. From a seal we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> later rose further to protonobelissimos, and in a manuscript that belonged to him, he is finally recorded as megas doux. Opos is last attested in 1097, during the First Crusade, when he was tasked with preventing the forces of a certain count, Raoul, from crossing the Bosporus, and even engaged in battle with the Crusaders.|$|E
25|$|Aimé De Mesmaeker {{is a rich}} businessman; we <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> owns {{a private}} jet (until Gaston destroys it) and that his oldest {{daughter}} drives an Alfa Romeo. His precise line of business is unknown, but he is repeatedly lured into the offices of Spirou by Fantasio or Prunelle in order to sign some lucrative contracts (see below). De Mesmaeker has developed a deep loathing for Gaston and by extension his colleagues. His frequent visits allow Franquin to satirise business rituals, as Dupuis's employees shower him with attention, complimentary drinks, cigars but De Mesmaeker almost inevitably ends up storming out of the offices, swearing never to set foot in them again, {{passed out on the}} floor or even in hospital due to Gaston's catastrophic blunders.|$|E

25|$|On 7 February 1914, William let the Great Powers <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> {{would accept}} the throne. On 21 February 1914 a {{delegation}} of Albanian notables led by Essad Pasha Toptani and Arbëreshë ones (headed by Luigi Baffa and Vincenzo Baffa Trasci), made a formal request, which he accepted thereby becoming By the grace of the powers and {{the will of the}} people the Prince (Mbret) of Albania. One month after accepting the throne on 7 March, he arrived in his provisional capital of Durrës and started to organise his government, appointing Turhan Pasha Përmeti to form the first Albanian cabinet. This first cabinet was dominated by aristocrats (prince Essad Pasha Toptani defence and foreign affairs, prince George Adamidi bey Frachery finances, prince Aziz Pasha Vrioni agriculture).|$|E
25|$|James Robertson was a Roman Catholic {{priest who}} was born in Scotland but spent much of his life in a monastery in Regensberg, Germany. He went to England where he took {{employment}} as a tutor to an aristocratic family. While there, he let Wellesley <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was willing to serve the British government in its struggle against Napoleon's empire. Canning contacted Robertson who accepted the mission {{to get in touch with}} La Romana. The spy was introduced into Europe via a smuggling ship that passed from Heligoland to Bremerhaven. Finding that the Spaniards were no longer in the vicinity of the Hanseatic towns, Robertson traveled north into Denmark, posing as a German merchant of chocolate and cigars, which were contraband goods.|$|E
25|$|Preston, however, {{could not}} draw the puritans {{to the side}} of Buckingham, whom they profoundly distrusted. Preston's friends urged the {{necessity}} of a conference on Montagu's books, and nominated on the one side John Buckeridge, Bishop of Rochester, and Francis White, then dean of Carlisle; on the other, Thomas Morton, then Bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, and Preston. Buckingham played a double part, begging Preston as his friend to decline the conference, and letting others <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> had done with Preston. The conference was held in February 1626 at York House. Preston refused to take part, but came in after it was begun and sat by as a hearer. A second conference followed in the same month, at which Preston took the lead against Montagu and White.|$|E
