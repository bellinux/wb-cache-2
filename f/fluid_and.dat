40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{particle}} {{model for}} simulating incompressible inviscid <b>fluids</b> <b>and</b> deformable solids is presented. In this model both <b>fluids</b> <b>and</b> solids are {{described by the}} Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics: fluid dynamics is studied in the weakly compressible approximation, while solid dynamics is simulated through an incremental hypoelastic relation. <b>Fluids</b> <b>and</b> solids are characterized by the same formulations, thus the need to define an interface for coupling disparate <b>fluids</b> <b>and</b> solids models is eliminated, and the interaction between them can be achieved naturally without the complex coupling interface. The model has been tested with several examples, and the experimental results show the realistic aspects of coupling <b>fluids</b> <b>and</b> solid motion...|$|R

5|$|Another {{proposed}} space-related {{application of}} americium is a fuel for space ships with nuclear propulsion.

This problem is pertinent to uranium or plutonium rods, in which only surface layers provide alpha-particles. The fission products of 242mAm can either directly propel the spaceship or they can heat up a thrusting gas; they can also transfer their energy to a <b>fluid</b> <b>and</b> generate electricity through a magnetohydrodynamic generator.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{presence}} of an iron core, Ganymede's magnetosphere remains enigmatic, particularly given that similar bodies lack the feature. Some research has suggested that, given its relatively small size, the core ought to have sufficiently cooled to the point where fluid motions, hence a magnetic field would not be sustained. One explanation is that the same orbital resonances proposed to have disrupted the surface also allowed the magnetic field to persist: with Ganymede's eccentricity pumped and tidal heating of the mantle increased during such resonances, reducing heat flow from the core, leaving it <b>fluid</b> <b>and</b> convective. Another explanation is a remnant magnetization of silicate rocks in the mantle, which is possible if the satellite had a more significant dynamo-generated field in the past.|$|E
5|$|Front {{tracking}} {{methods have}} long been used in fluid dynamics to model and track the motion of boundaries between different materials, of steep gradients in material properties such as weather fronts, or of shock waves within a single material. These methods involve deriving the equations of motion of the boundary, and using them to directly simulate {{the motion of the}} boundary, rather than simulating the underlying <b>fluid</b> <b>and</b> treating the boundary as an emergent property of the fluid. The same methods {{can also be used to}} simulate the curve-shortening flow, even when the curve undergoing the flow is not a boundary or shock.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular <b>fluid</b> <b>and</b> then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
