2500|$|In February 1965, as the Gaming Board was {{considering}} {{the issuance of}} a gambling license, the hotel submitted multiple partnership changes that would include increasing Parker's ownership from eight percent to twenty percent. The Gaming Board deferred action on the gambling license until the following month. Board member W. E. Leypoldt said, [...] "I don't think it's <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> us to act on something that's entirely different from what was presented Monday. It would do the casino industry {{a great deal of}} harm if you opened and in six months went broke because of lack of financing." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "People {{sometimes}} {{say such}} things, {{but when they}} have to do a good deal more than usual they mind very much. Anyhow, it isn't <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> them, and that's one reason for my going away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{is not a}} <b>fair</b> {{question}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> us," [...] declared another dragonette. [...] "For, if we {{told you}} truly, you might escape us altogether; and if we told you an untruth we would be naughty and deserve to be punished." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe he could. But that isn't the point, Tom. I {{told you}} before {{that we want to}} 'stand on our own bottom.' Besides, it isn't a <b>fair</b> thing <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any one <b>to</b> put up money like that without {{offering}} good security." ...|$|R
40|$|The 40 th {{anniversary of}} Cell coincides {{with that of}} the National Institute on Aging (NIA). Indeed, Cell papers on NIA-funded {{research}} helped move the field into a genetic and molecular era.

6000|$|Guy made a {{step towards}} the window, and {{a step back}} again. ''Tis not <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> such questions,' he replied, after a moment. 'It is {{throwing}} oil on the fire. I was trying to forget it. He neither knows my uncle nor the circumstances.' ...|$|E

6000|$|I held to my point, {{adding that}} I {{did not think}} Lord Aberdeen and [...] Lord Palmerston {{represented}} opposite principles, but rather [...] different forms of the same principles connected with different [...] habits and temperaments. He said that Lord Palmerston had agreed to [...] lead the House of Commons for him, he going as first minister to [...] the Lords; {{but he did not}} mention any other alteration. Upon the [...] whole his tone was low and doubtful. He asked whether my answer was [...] to be considered as given, or whether I would take time. But I said [...] as there was no probability that my ideas would be modified by [...] reflection, it would not be <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> him <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> any delay.|$|R

6000|$|... "May be {{that she}} has no taste for such an old fellow. Hush, mother. Seriously, my chief scruple is whether it be <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> a girl to marry a man twice her age, when she has {{absolutely}} seen nothing of his kind but the German master!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What did you do?" [...] she demanded. [...] "No, {{perhaps you}} had luck. Perhaps it's not <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you that. It wouldn't apply. What {{should you do}} if you were me, if you had the chance {{to get out of it}} all the way that she has?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, Roger," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "It wouldn't be <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> {{you to do}} that.

40|$|Traditionally, {{academic}} {{science has}} used graduate students {{to collect data}} in many cases, but community science, the term by which citizen science is also known, has revolutionized {{the process by which}} large amounts of data can be collected accurately by large numbers of non-scientists under the training and mentorship of scientists. There has been some discussion in the scientific community about whether the data collected by citizen scientists is as scientifically valid as data collected by traditional methods and this is a <b>fair</b> question <b>to</b> <b>ask...</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{the admiral}} said hastily, [...] "that's not a <b>fair</b> {{question}} <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> However, I {{will tell you}} in confidence that, if he should escape, {{which is the most}} unlikely thing in the world, you know, no one would be particularly sorry, {{and there would be no}} great fuss made about it. Everyone in the navy here would feel it cast a slur upon the service if, at a time like this, a naval officer were tried and shot for treachery. However, if it must be it must.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do know,' {{said the}} old gentleman, laying his finger on his nose, {{with an air of}} familiarity, most reprehensible, 'that this is a sacred and enchanted spot, where the most divine charms'--here he kissed his hand and bowed again--'waft mellifluousness over the neighbours' gardens, and force the fruit and {{vegetables}} into premature existence. That fact I am acquainted with.

6000|$|... "You {{must see}} that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only learned the true facts under the pledge of {{professional}} secrecy, to tell what he has withheld?

6000|$|... "It was not <b>fair</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you. What I {{wish to do}} is {{to restore}} the {{original}} status.

6000|$|With swift furtive steps he {{was across}} the room and on his knees beside the couch, kissing the pendent hand. [...] "You have saved me, most noble sir!" [...] he cried.

40|$|The {{principle}} of good faith is fundamental {{in the law}} of international trade. This global consensus derives from its origin in European civil law. A <b>fair</b> question <b>to</b> be <b>asked</b> is whether {{there is also a}} substantial consensus on its content and operation as it moves away from a European location. Also it should be discussed whether the {{principle of}} good faith has a place in contemporary Asian principles of contract law...|$|R
40|$|Tinker v. Des Moines Independent Community School District 1 is rightly {{regarded}} as a landmark student speech case. At this point, however, it is <b>fair</b> and important <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> about the likely consequences of radically abandoning Tinker and the succeeding case law. 2 What might it mean, at this historical point, to abandon Tinker along with its qualifying and limiting cases? The discussion below briefly pursues this question and endorses a radical abandonment of Tinker and the succeeding cases as binding case law...|$|R

6000|$|... "Should {{that prove}} to be the case, you are welcome back to your own," [...] said Lord Braithwaite, quietly. [...] "It will be a very {{remarkable}} case, if the proofs for two hundred years, or thereabouts, can be so distinctly made out as to nullify the claim of one whose descent is undoubted.
