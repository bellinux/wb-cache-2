5|$|In practice, however, this {{restriction}} {{is often}} ignored {{and the two}} flags – with and without coat of arms – are treated as <b>interchangeable.</b> The variant with the coat of arms is particularly often used by the Polonia, or Polish diaspora outside Poland, especially in the United States.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the most}} {{successful}} features of the class were used by Drummond on his other designs. Thus the boiler, cylinders and motion were identical and <b>interchangeable</b> with those used on his 700 class 0-6-0 freight locomotives of 1897 and the same boiler was used on his C8 4-4-0 passenger class.|$|E
5|$|The Ju 87 {{was fitted}} with {{detachable}} hatches and removable coverings to aid and ease maintenance and overhaul. The designers avoided welding parts wherever possible, preferring moulded and cast parts instead. Large airframe segments were <b>interchangeable</b> {{as a complete}} unit, which increased speed of repair.|$|E
5|$|The {{basic variant}} of the {{national}} flag is a plain white-and-red horizontal bicolor. A variant defaced with the coat of arms is restricted to official use abroad and at sea. Legal restrictions notwithstanding, the two variants are often treated as <b>interchangeable</b> in practice.|$|E
5|$|The {{interior}} of the building contains several innovative elements. The partitions between the offices are soundproofed and divided into <b>interchangeable</b> sections, so that the layout of any could be changed quickly and comfortably. The pipes under the floors carry both telephone and electricity cables.|$|E
5|$|To ease {{maintenance}} and venting, cavities and cores {{are divided into}} pieces, called inserts, and sub-assemblies, also called inserts, blocks, or chase blocks. By substituting <b>interchangeable</b> inserts, one mould may make several variations of the same part.|$|E
5|$|Uppercase and {{lowercase}} prefixes are not <b>interchangeable.</b> E.g., {{the quantities}} 1mW and 1MW represent two different quantities; {{the former is}} the typical power requirement of a hearing aid (1milliwatt or 0.001watts), and the latter the typical power requirement of a suburban train (1megawatt or watts).|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} cats is {{referred}} to as a clowder or a glaring, a male cat is called a tom or tomcat (or a gib, if neutered), an unaltered female is called a queen, and a juvenile cat {{is referred to}} as a kitten. The male progenitor of a cat, especially a pedigreed cat, is its sire, and its female progenitor is its dam. In Early Modern English, the word kitten was <b>interchangeable</b> with the now obsolete word catling.|$|E
5|$|Colt's {{manufacturing}} methods {{were at the}} forefront of the Industrial Revolution. His use of <b>interchangeable</b> parts helped him become one of the first to use the assembly line efficiently. Moreover, his innovative use of art, celebrity endorsements, and corporate gifts to promote his wares made him a pioneer in the fields of advertising, product placement, and mass marketing.|$|E
5|$|In Final Fantasy VII, {{the player}} directs the protagonist {{throughout}} the game {{world with a}} group of three <b>interchangeable</b> party members, exploring areas and interacting with non-player characters. Most of Final Fantasy VII occurs within the city of Midgar for the first act, later expanding to towns, dungeons, caves, and similar areas {{for the rest of the}} game. Players can save their game at any time when not in combat to the game's single save slot for later playing.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine frame was made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were <b>interchangeable,</b> and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E
5|$|Naming is a {{symbolic}} {{tradition of the}} islands' Maori population. Names form a link not only to ancestors, descendents, and friends, but to titles and land, as well as events and relationships. Dreamed or created, name change {{are not limited to}} events, such as birth, marriage, and death, but can also occur in association with a bad omen. First names are <b>interchangeable</b> between men and women, while surnames can vary from person to person within a family unit.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{control their}} use of these {{electron}} donors and acceptors by varying which enzymes are produced, in response to environmental conditions. This flexibility is possible because different oxidases and reductases use the same ubiquinone pool. This allows many combinations of enzymes to function together, linked by the common ubiquinol intermediate. These respiratory chains therefore have a modular design, with easily <b>interchangeable</b> sets of enzyme systems.|$|E
5|$|The Mark XIV Computing Bomb Sight was a vector bombsight {{developed}} by Royal Air Force (RAF) Bomber Command during the Second World War. The bombsight was {{also known as}} the Blackett sight after its primary inventor, P. M. S. Blackett. Production of a slightly modified version was also undertaken in the United States as the Sperry T-1, which was <b>interchangeable</b> with UK-built version. It was the RAF's standard bombsight for {{the second half of the}} War.|$|E
5|$|The N1 {{prototype}} was {{the result}} of modifications made to Nclass No.822 during construction in 1922. The locomotive became operational in 1923 and used parts <b>interchangeable</b> with other Maunsell locomotive classes. The prototype N1 was {{the only member of the}} class constructed before the SECR became part of the Southern Railway at the Grouping in 1923, and featured a variant of the Gresley conjugated valve gear designed by Harold Holcroft. The class set the precedent for the Southern Railway's subsequent 3-cylinder designs.|$|E
5|$|The most {{well-known}} horse {{of the medieval}} era of Europe is the destrier, known for carrying knights into war. However, most knights and mounted men-at-arms rode smaller horses known as coursers and rounceys. (A common generic name for medieval war horses was charger, which was <b>interchangeable</b> with the other terms). In Spain, the jennet {{was used as a}} light cavalry horse.|$|E
5|$|The payload bay {{elements}} were the Super Lightweight <b>Interchangeable</b> Carrier (SLIC) which held the Wide Field Camera 3, new batteries, and a radiator; the ORU Carrier which stored the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph and FGS-3R instruments; the Flight Support Structure (FSS) which held onto the Hubble during repairs;, the Multi-Use Lightweight Equipment Carrier (MULE) which held support {{equipment and the}} Relative Navigation Sensor (RNS) Experiment.|$|E
5|$|Design {{managers}} often {{operate in}} the area of design leadership; however, design management and design leadership are interdependent rather than <b>interchangeable.</b> Like management and leadership, they differ in their objectives, achievements of objectives, accomplishments, and outcomes. Design leadership leads from creation of a vision to changes, innovations, and implementation of creative solutions. It stimulates communication and collaboration through motivation, sets ambitions, and points out future directions to achieve long-term objectives. In contrast, design management is reactive and responds to a given business situation by using specific skills, tools, methods, and techniques. Design management requires design leadership to know where to go and design leadership requires design management to know how to get there.|$|E
5|$|Each Province is a two-sided <b>interchangeable</b> board, on {{one side}} of which is a Harbinger's {{province}} while on the other are the sewers. The Provinces can be assembled in any order, which can allow different game experiences when the Provinces are changed. Each Province has its own headstone and is in the Harbinger's colours. Both sides of the Province board have paths used by the players to move around the board. Located along the paths are the six Keystones for that colour Province, and three different game symbols: the black holes, the lighting bolts and the compasses.|$|E
5|$|Equipped {{with special}} Allied Full Cushion {{high-speed}} swing-motion trucks, Pullman troop sleepers {{were designed to}} be fully <b>interchangeable</b> with all other passenger equipment. The units came equipped with end doors {{similar to those found}} on standard railway cars, but had no vestibules. Loading and unloading of passengers was accomplished via wide doors positioned on each side {{at the center of the}} cars with built-in trap doors and steps. Light and ventilation was provided by ten window units mounted on each side, each equipped with rolling black out shades and wire mesh screens.|$|E
5|$|Historians Jonathan Parshall and Anthony Tully {{believe that}} by {{combining}} the surviving aircraft and pilots from Shōkaku and Zuikaku, {{it is likely that}} Zuikaku could have been equipped with almost a full composite air group. They also note that doing so would have violated Japanese carrier doctrine, which stressed that carriers and their airgroups must train as a single unit (in contrast, American air squadrons were considered <b>interchangeable</b> between carriers). In any case, the Japanese apparently made no serious attempt to get Zuikaku ready for the forthcoming battle.|$|E
5|$|In some countries, other {{coumarins}} {{are used}} instead of warfarin, such as acenocoumarol and phenprocoumon. These have a shorter (acenocoumarol) or longer (phenprocoumon) half-life, and are not completely <b>interchangeable</b> with warfarin. Several types of anticoagulant drugs offering the efficacy of warfarin without a need for monitoring, such as dabigatran, apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban, have been approved {{in a number of}} countries for classical warfarin uses like the more common types of atrial fibrillation, and others in the same drug classes are under development. There is a reversal agent available for dabigatran (idarucizumab) but not for apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban.|$|E
5|$|Metroid Primes second full sequel is , which {{closes the}} Prime series. It was {{released}} on August 27, 2007, for the Wii console. In Corruptions story, Samus is corrupted by Phazon after being attacked by Dark Samus, who has become {{the leader of a}} Space Pirate group and is sending Phazon Seeds to corrupt planets. Corruptions gameplay differs from that of Prime and Echoes; the assisted aiming is replaced with free aiming with the Wii Remote, and the <b>interchangeable</b> beams are replaced with a stackable upgrade system.|$|E
5|$|Most {{scholars}} {{reject the}} idea that Hamlet is in any way connected with Shakespeare's only son, Hamnet Shakespeare, who died in 1596 at age eleven. Conventional wisdom holds that Hamlet is too obviously connected to legend, and the name Hamnet was quite popular at the time. However, Stephen Greenblatt {{has argued that the}} coincidence of the names and Shakespeare's grief for the loss of his son may {{lie at the heart of}} the tragedy. He notes that the name of Hamnet Sadler, the Stratford neighbour after whom Hamnet was named, was often written as Hamlet Sadler and that, in the loose orthography of the time, the names were virtually <b>interchangeable.</b>|$|E
5|$|Next is {{the short}} barrel; {{this part of}} the {{instrument}} may be extended to fine-tune the clarinet. As the pitch of the clarinet is fairly temperature-sensitive, some instruments have <b>interchangeable</b> barrels whose lengths vary slightly. Additional compensation for pitch variation and tuning can be made by pulling out the barrel and thus increasing the instrument's length, particularly common in group playing in which clarinets are tuned to other instruments (such as in an orchestra or concert band). Some performers use a plastic barrel with a thumbwheel that adjusts the barrel length. On basset horns and lower clarinets, the barrel is normally replaced by a curved metal neck.|$|E
5|$|The Nclass was {{mechanically}} {{similar to}} the SECR Kclass 2-6-4 passenger tank engine, also by Maunsell. It influenced future 2-6-0 development in Britain and {{provided the basis for}} the 3-cylinder N1class of 1922. Production was delayed by the outbreak of the First World War in 1914, and the first Nclass rolled out of Ashford Works in 1917, three years after design work was completed. The class replaced obsolete 0-6-0s as part of the SECR's fleet standardisation, as they used parts <b>interchangeable</b> with those of other classes.|$|E
5|$|The U {{class was}} {{designed}} in the mid-1920s for production {{at a time when}} more obsolete 4-4-0 locomotives were withdrawn, and derived from Maunsell’s earlier SECR K (“River”) class 2-6-4 tank locomotives. The first 20members of the U class were rebuilds of the K class locomotives, one of which was involved in the Sevenoaks railway accident. A further 20U class locomotives were built in 1928 to fill the gap in cross-country and semi-fast express passenger services after the withdrawal of the K class. The design also continued the standardisation of the Southern Railway locomotive fleet by using parts designed to be <b>interchangeable</b> with other Maunsell-designed classes.|$|E
5|$|The United States {{has been}} a leader in {{technological}} innovation since the late 19th century and scientific research since the mid-20th century. Methods for producing <b>interchangeable</b> parts were developed by the U.S. War Department by the Federal Armories {{during the first half of}} the 19th century. This technology, along with the establishment of a machine tool industry, enabled the U.S. to have large scale manufacturing of sewing machines, bicycles and other items in the late 19th century and became known as the American system of manufacturing. Factory electrification in the early 20th century and introduction of the assembly line and other labor saving techniques created the system called mass production.|$|E
5|$|The {{airframe}} of the Hunter {{consists of}} six <b>interchangeable</b> major sections: the forward fuselage (housing {{the cockpit and}} armament pack), center fuselage (including the integral wing roots and air duct intakes), rear fuselage, tail unit assembly, and two individually produced wings. Production was divided up so major sections could be completed individually and manufacturing of the type could be dispersed to reduce vulnerability to attack. Establishing initial full-rate production for the type was difficult; manufacturing the Hunter required the development of 3,250 tool designs and the procurement of 40,000 fixtures, jigs, and tools.|$|E
5|$|The first temperature-sensitive RNA element was {{reported}} in 1989. Prior to this research, mutations upstream from the transcription start site in a lambda (λ) phage cIII mRNA were found to affect the level of translation of the cIII protein. This protein is involved in selection of either a lytic or lysogenic life cycle in λ phage, with high concentrations of cIII promoting lysogeny. Further study of this upstream RNA region identified two alternative secondary structures; experimental study found the structures to be <b>interchangeable,</b> and dependent on both magnesium ion concentration and temperature. This RNA thermometer is now thought to encourage entry to a lytic cycle under heat stress {{in order for the}} bacteriophage to rapidly replicate and escape the host cell.|$|E
5|$|Xiangqi (See also: List of Chinese inventions#L – Liubo): The exact {{origins of}} the Chinese chess board game known as xiangqi are ambiguous. Historian David H. Li asserts that it was first invented by Han Xin (d. 196 BC), a renowned {{military}} general of the early Han Dynasty who fell victim to a purge instigated by Empress Lü Zhi (d. 180 BC). Li states that it was revived under a different, camouflaged name of xiangxi by Emperor Wu of Northern Zhou (r. 561–578), which to this day has made the two terms synonymous and <b>interchangeable</b> for the same game.|$|E
5|$|Although {{by the end}} of 1837 the Arms Company {{had made}} over 1,000 weapons, there were no sales. Following the Panic of 1837, the company's {{underwriters}} were reluctant to fund the new machinery that Colt needed to make <b>interchangeable</b> parts, so he went on the road to raise money. Demonstrating his gun to people in general stores did not generate the sales volume he needed, so with another loan from his cousin, Selden, he went to Washington, D.C., and demonstrated it to President Andrew Jackson. Jackson approved of the gun and wrote Colt a note saying so. Presidential approval in hand, Colt pushed a bill through Congress endorsing a demonstration for the military, but failed to obtain an appropriation for military purchase of the weapon. A promising order from the state of South Carolina for fifty to seventy-five pistols was canceled when the company did not produce them quickly enough.|$|E
5|$|Another key design {{decision}} {{was to develop}} the concept car based on a new family of common powertrain components for electric propulsion, which initially was called the E-Flex Systems, “E” stands for electric drive and “Flex” for the different sources of electricity, but later was renamed Voltec drive system. The E-Flex or Voltec powertrain {{is an attempt to}} standardize many components of possible future electrically propelled vehicles, and to allow multiple <b>interchangeable</b> electricity-generating systems. The E-Flex powertrain has the potential to adapt the vehicles to pure battery electric, to fuel cell-powered or to several other sources of energy to create electricity on board, such as engine-generator sets (genset) fueled by gasoline, diesel, biodiesel, ethanol fuel (E100), or flex-fuel (E85). Regenerative braking would also contribute to the on-board electricity generation. In October 2006 the E-flex powertrain was selected for the new propulsion architecture and the name Volt was chosen by General Motors.|$|E
5|$|Equites cataphractarii, {{or simply}} cataphractarii for short, were the heavily {{armoured}} cavalry of the Roman army. Based on Sarmatian and Parthian models, {{they were also}} known as contarii and clibanarii, although {{it is unclear whether}} these terms were <b>interchangeable</b> or whether they denoted variations in equipment or role. Together with new units of light mounted archers, the cataphractarii were designed to counter Parthian (and, in Pannonia, Sarmatian) battle tactics. Parthian armies consisted largely of cavalry. Their standard tactic was to use light mounted archers to weaken and break up the Roman infantry line, and then to rout it with a charge by the cataphractarii concentrated on the weakest point. The only special heavy cavalry units to appear in the 2nd-century record are: ala I Ulpia contariorum and ala I Gallorum et Pannoniorum cataphractaria stationed in Pannonia and Moesia Inferior respectively in the 2nd century.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} quarter of 2012, the Naga 2012 was released. Similarly to the Naga Epic, it came with <b>interchangeable</b> side panels. The Naga 2012 {{supported}} Razer's Synapse 2.0 software allowing all the buttons to be programmed and that information to be stored online. The other 2012 installment was the Naga Hex, the first mouse in the series to have only six programmable side-on buttons. Razer noted it was made for multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBAs), such as League of Legends and Diablo 3, instead of massively multiplayer online games (MMOs). In May of the same year, the Wraith Red edition was released. The only difference between the versions was the coloring. In March 2013, after the announcement of a partnership between Razer and Riot Games, a League of Legends style Naga Hex was released, with the only difference being the design and the change from a plastic to a matte surface.|$|E
5|$|Marble Madness was {{developed}} by Atari Games, with Mark Cerny as the lead designer and Bob Flanagan as the software engineer. Both Cerny and Flanagan handled programming the game. It uses the Atari System 1 hardware, an <b>interchangeable</b> system of circuit boards, control panels, and artwork. The game features pixel graphics on a 19-inch Electrohome G07 model CRT monitor, and uses a Motorola 68010 central processing unit (CPU) with a MOS Technology 6502 subsystem to control the audio and coin operations. Marble Madness was Atari's first game to use an FM sound chip produced by Yamaha, {{which is similar to}} a Yamaha DX7 synthesizer and creates the music in real time so that it is in synchronization with the game's on-screen action. The game's music was composed by Brad Fuller and Hal Canon who spent a few months becoming familiar with the capabilities of the sound chip.|$|E
