The crystal chemical phenomena (e. g. ionic ordering, polyhedral stacking variations, microtwinning, modulation), which accompany the formation of real structures, are discussed on the basis of structural studies of a large group of minerals, recently investigated in the Moscow State University. The new approaches used for their investigation allowed extending the scientific ideas connected with: the composition and structure of the deep <b>geospheres,</b> structural classification of minerals, forms of concentration of chemical elements in the Earth's crust, further development of modular theory and other problems of modern struc-tural mineralogy.

25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their geological disposal in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the <b>geosphere.</b> The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E

2500|$|Methane {{is a major}} {{component}} of natural gas. <b>Geosphere</b> methane is intriguing for the large input of microbial methanogenesis. This process exhibits a strong isotope effect, resulting in greater D-depletion in methane relative to other hydrocarbons. δD ranges from -275‰ to -100‰ in thermogenic methane, and from -400‰ to -150‰ in microbial methane. Also, methane formed by marine methanogens is generally enriched in D relative to methane from freshwater methanogens. δD of methane has been plotted together with other geochemical tools(like δ13C, gas wetness) to categorize and identify natural gas. A δD-δ13C diagram (sometimes referred to as CD diagram, Whiticar diagram, or Schoell diagram [...] ) is widely used to place methane in one of the three distinct groups: thermogenic methane that is higher in both δ13C and δD; marine microbial methane that is more depleted in 13C and freshwater microbial methane that is more depleted in D. Hydrogenotrophic methanogenesis produces less D-depleted methane relative to acetoclastic methanogenesis. The location where the organism lives and substrate concentration also affect isotopic composition: rumen methanogenesis, which occurs in a more closed system and with higher partial pressures of hydrogen, exhibits a greater fractionation (-300 to -400‰) than wetland methanogenesis (-250 to -170‰).|$|E

Nevertheless, the reported anomalies have not been so far synergically analyzed to interpret or prove the potential lithosphere–coversphere–atmosphere coupling (LCAC) process. Previous studies on b  value (a seismicity parameter from Gutenberg–Richter law) are also insufficient. In this work, the spatiotemporal evolution of several hydrothermal parameters related to the coversphere and atmosphere, including soil moisture, soil temperature, near-surface air temperature, and precipitable water, was comprehensively investigated. Air temperature and atmospheric aerosol were also statistically analyzed in time series with ground observations. An abnormal enhancement of aerosol occurred on 30  March  2009 and thus proved quasi-synchronous anomalies among the hydrothermal parameters from 29  to 31  March in particular places geo-related to tectonic thrusts and local topography.
