5|$|The killer murders another woman, {{disposing}} {{of the body}} in a post office's dead letter office. Investigating, Black finds a human <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> message etched into it—"hair today, gone tomorrow"—which he takes as an indication that the murderer is lashing out at a world that he feels has treated him as insignificant. Horn's mental condition seems to deteriorate, and he begins to take the case personally, leading Black to doubt his ability.|$|E
5|$|Little {{more than}} a year after her birth, Maria Theresa was joined by a sister, Maria Anna, and another one, named Maria Amalia, was born in 1724. The portraits of the {{imperial}} family show that Maria Theresa resembled Elisabeth Christine and Maria Anna. The Prussian ambassador noted that she had large blue eyes, fair <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> slight tinge of red, a wide mouth and a notably strong body. Unlike many other members of the House of Habsburg, neither Maria Theresa's parents nor her grandparents were closely related to each other.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} Ardhanarishvara {{originated}} in Kushan and Greek cultures simultaneously; the iconography {{evolved in the}} Kushan era (30–375 CE), but was perfected in the Gupta era (320-600 CE). A mid-first century Kushan era stela in the Mathura Museum has a half-male, half-female image, along with three other figures identified with Vishnu, Gaja Lakshmi and Kubera. The male half is ithyphallic or with an urdhvalinga and makes an abhaya mudra gesture; the female left half holds a mirror and has a rounded breast. This is the earliest representation of Ardhanarishvara, universally recognized. An early Kushan Ardhanarishvara head discovered at Rajghat is displayed at the Mathura Museum. The right male half has matted <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> skull and crescent moon; the left female half has well-combed hair decorated with flowers and wears a patra-kundala (earring). The face has a common third eye. A terracotta seal discovered in Vaishali has half-man, half-woman features. Early Kushan images show Ardhanarishvara in a simple two-armed form, but later texts and sculptures depict a more complex iconography.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of {{three types of}} headed hairs has been studied: 1) <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> unicellular stalk and a head divided vertically into two cells, 2) bottle-like hairs, 3) morel-like and two types of headless hairs: <b>a)</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> characteristic 2 - 3 -celled base, b) without the characteristic base in six representatives belonging to 4 sections of the genus Plantago L. The bottle-like and the morel-like hairs may have originated from the <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> unicellular stalk and a head divided vertically into two cells. The Plantago sections characterized {{by the presence of}} the bottle-like and morel-like hairs are probably evolutionally younger than the sections characterized by the presence of <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> unicellular stalk and a head divided vertically into two cells...|$|R
40|$|At Lamiaceae species the morphology, {{distribution}} {{and frequency of}} secretory hairs are used as taxonomic characters. At the most species from this family they {{are two types of}} secretory hairs: peltate and capitate, this types of hair can easily be distinguished after the number of cells of the secretory gland. For the investigation of secretory structures of Thymus vulgaris L. seedlings of different ages have been obtained. The secretory hairs from analyzed species present a basal cell, un unicellular stalk and based on numbers of cells ho form the gland, the hair can be: <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> unicellular gland presents on all vegetative organs, <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> bicellular gland presents only at the level of leafs primordium and <b>hairs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> pluricelullar glands presents on all vegetative organs...|$|R

5|$|As {{in falls}} one and two, Guerrero and Hijo del Santo started out against each other. At one point, Guerrero applied Hijo del Santo's own {{submission}} hold, La de a Caballo (camel clutch), {{on him to}} mock his opponent, but {{was not able to}} make Hijo del Santo submit before Octagón saved his partner. Later in the fall, with the referee distracted, Barr was able to surprise Octagón and execute a kneeling reverse piledriver, a move that would have been an automatic disqualification in Lucha Libre. Moments later, Barr was able to pin Octagón to eliminate him from the match. In Lucha Libre, the piledriver is treated as a very dangerous move, something that was sold during this match by Octagón being taken from the arena on a stretcher during the closing moments of the third fall. Minutes later, Hijo del Santo was actually able to kick out of the Superplex/Frog Splash combo by La Pareja del Terror. At one point, both Hijo del Santo and Guerrero were on the floor, which distracted the referee long enough for Blue Panther to enter the ring and perform a piledriver of his own on Barr in retaliation for what was done to Octagón. The move was not seen by the referee but allowed Hijo del Santo to pin Barr, leaving just Hijo del Santo and Guerrero still in the match. A minute or two later, Hijo del Santo was able to roll up Guerrero for the final pinfall and the victory for his team. Following their loss, both Guerrero and Barr visibly cried in the ring, selling the severeness of the loss as they cut off each other's <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> pair of scissors. This was followed by an AAA official shaving off the rest of their hair with electric clippers backstage.|$|E

For instance, Kiki observes the tradition of witches wearing black, but adorns her <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> bright red bow. Kiki also engages in other traditional methods, such as baking with a wood-burning stove and flying her mother's old broom.|$|E

25|$|Tzeniut (modesty) {{applies to}} men and women. When {{attending}} Orthodox synagogues, women will likely be expected to wear long sleeves (past the elbows), long skirts (past the knees), a high neckline (to the collar bone), and if married, to cover their <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> wig, scarf, hat {{or a combination of}} the above. For men, short pants or sleeveless shirts are generally regarded as inappropriate. In some Conservative and Reform synagogues the dress code may be more lax, but still respectful.|$|E
25|$|Their outfit is also {{different}} from that of other Arabs, since the men wear long 'jellabiya' and a 'smagg' (red white draped headcover) or 'aymemma' (white headcover) or a white small headdress, sometimes held in place by an 'agall' (a black cord). Bedouin women usually wear brightly coloured long dresses but outside they wear 'abaya' (a thin, long black coat sometimes covered with shiny embroidery) and they will always cover their head and <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> 'tarha' (a black, thin shawl) when they leave their house.|$|E
25|$|The Tanner scale {{looks at}} the {{development}} of pubic hair. Before the onset of puberty, the genital area of {{both boys and girls}} has very fine vellus hair (stage 1). At the onset of puberty, the body produces rising levels of the sex hormones, and in response, the skin of the genital area begins to produce thicker and rougher, often curlier, <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> faster growth rate. The onset of pubic hair development is termed pubarche. The change for each hair follicle is relatively abrupt, but the extent of skin which grows androgenic hair gradually increases over several years.|$|E

25|$|The Ethiopian church {{places a}} heavier {{emphasis}} on Old Testament teachings {{than one might}} find in Eastern Orthodox, Roman Catholic or Protestant churches, and its followers adhere to certain practices that one finds in Orthodox or Conservative Judaism. Ethiopian Christians, like some other Eastern Christians, traditionally follow dietary rules {{that are similar to}} Jewish Kashrut, specifically with regard to how an animal is slaughtered. Similarly, pork is prohibited, though unlike Rabbinical Kashrut, Ethiopian cuisine does mix dairy products with meat. Women are prohibited from entering the church temple during menses; they are also expected to cover their <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> large scarf (or shash) while in church, as described in 1 Corinthians, chapter 11. As with Orthodox synagogues, men and women are seated separately in the Ethiopian church, with men on the left and women on the right (when facing the altar). (Women covering their heads and separation of the sexes in churches officially is common to some other Christian traditions; it is also the rule in some non-Christian religions, Islam and Orthodox Judaism among them). Ethiopian Orthodox worshippers remove their shoes when entering a church temple, in accordance with Exodus 3:5 (in which Moses, while viewing the burning bush, was commanded to remove his shoes while standing on holy ground). Furthermore, the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church upholds Sabbatarianism, observing the seventh-day Sabbath (Saturday), in addition to the Lord's Day (Sunday), although more emphasis, because of the Resurrection of Christ, is laid upon Sunday. The Ethiopian Orthodox Church calls for male circumcision, with near-universal prevalence among Orthodox men in Ethiopia.|$|E

500|$|More generally, dragonflies are {{symbols of}} courage, strength, and happiness, {{and they often}} appear in art and literature, {{especially}} haiku. [...] Japanese children catch large dragonflies as a game, using a <b>hair</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> small pebble tied to each end, which they throw into the air.
