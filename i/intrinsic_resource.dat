40|$|There {{is great}} {{interest}} in supporting imprecise queries (e. g., keyword search or natural language queries) over databases today. To support such queries, the database system is typically required to disambiguate parts of the user-specified query against the database, using whatever resources are intrinsically available to it (the database schema, data values distributions, natural language models etc). Often, systems will also have a user-interaction log available, which can serve as an extrinsic resource to supplement their model {{based on their own}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>resources.</b> This leads to a problem of how best to combine the system's prior ranking with insight derived from the user-interaction log. Statistical inference techniques such as maximum likelihood or Bayesian updates from a subjective prior turn out not to apply in a straightforward way due to possible noise from user search behavior and to encoding biases endemic to the system's models.

40|$|International audienceMetabolic rate, a {{physiological}} trait {{closely related to}} fitness traits, is expected to evolve in response to two main environmental variables: (1) climate, low metabolic rates being found in dry and hot regions when comparing populations originating from different climates in a common garden experiment and (2) resource limitations, low metabolic rates being selected when resources are limited. The main goal {{of this study was}} to investigate if differences in <b>intrinsic</b> <b>resource</b> limitations may have disrupted the expected evolution of metabolic rate in response to climate in a parasitic wasp. We compared CO 2 production of females from 4 populations of a Drosophila parasitoid, Leptopilina boulardi, as an estimate of their metabolic rate. Two populations from a hot and dry area able to synthesise lipids de novo at adult stage were compared with two populations originating from a mild and humid climate where no lipid accumulation during adult life was observed. These last females are thus more limited in lipids than the first ones. We observed that a high metabolic rate has been selected in hot and dry environments, contrarily to the results of a great majority of studies. We suggest that lipogenesis occurring there may have allowed the selection of a higher metabolic rate, as females are less limited in energetic resources than females from the mild environment. A high metabolic rate may have been selected there as it partly compensates for the long distances that females have to cross to find laying opportunities in distant orchards. We suggest that intrinsic resources should be integrated when investigating geographical variations in metabolism as this factor may disrupt evolution in response to climate...|$|E

Increasingly, the extant literature highlights the myriad challenges experienced by socioeconomically disenfranchised populations to combat the insidious biopsychosocial impact of chronic health conditions. However, a counter argument suggests that rural Americans have wide ranging access to the natural environment—an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>resource</b> that offers {{a broad spectrum of}} health and wellness opportunities. Beyond its application as a tool for good health practices, green exercise—defined as physical activity in natural settings—can provide an existential platform for the ideals of self-sufficiency, solidarity, and sustainability. A call to capitalize on pre-existing prohealth resources represents an open window for social change dialogue as participants learn to reframe the idea of exercise—not as a task demand, but as an internalized lifestyle value. Invoking Astin and Astin’s (1996) social change model of leadership development, mentors of green exercise programs have opportunities to optimize their leadership and coalition skills, engender diversity-positive attitudes, and affect positive change in a widely underserved population. The following discussion highlights (a) cultural and ideological considerations, (b) theoretical foundations, (c) virtues of social change agency, and (d) the critical role of the program mentor as a facilitator of positive social change in the green exercise milieu. For a population that has been historically entrenched in perceived limitations, a revisionist view suggests that rural Americans have an abundance of nature-based prohealth resources at their disposal.

40|$|South African karst {{aquifers}} {{are mainly}} {{associated with the}} dolomitic lithologies of the Transvaal Supergroup. Despite the socio-economic and environmental importance of these aquifers, no scientifically based methodology to outline areas that need protection from potential harmful activities exists. Thus an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>resource</b> aquifer vulnerability mapping method for karst terrains in South Africa was developed. The methodology is a modification of the COP aquifer vulnerability mapping method, developed by the Hydrogeology Group of the University of Malaga. The method is predominantly based on the capability of the unsaturated zone to filter or attenuate pollutants by different processes but considers two additional factors that either increase or reduce the protection provided by the unsaturated zone. These are surface conditions that control water flowing towards zones of rapid infiltration, and the temporal availability of a transport agent (rainfall). These three factors are combined to obtain a final vulnerability index, which is spatially visualised using five vulnerability classes (ranging from Very Low to Very High). Modifications to the original COP method include, amongst others, the consideration of rock types commonly found in South Africa, a statistical redefinition of high rainfall (wet) years, a revised consideration of rainfall rates to account for dilution processes and the consideration of older, sediment filled swallow holes. The method was applied to produce a vulnerability map for Cradle of Humankind World Heritage Site near Krugersdorp, South Africa. The vulnerability map clearly shows the generally inferior but variable aquifer protection in areas characterised by dolomitic lithologies, while surrounding non-karstic areas offer moderate to high resource protection. The proposed aquifer vulnerability mapping methodology {{should be used to}} assess karstic terrains during land use planning and environmental impact assessments. As an easily understandable planning tool the maps can reduce the likelihood of aquifer pollution. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2009. Geologyunrestricte...|$|E

40|$|Reproductive {{success and}} the {{patterns}} of sexual allocation in flowering plants {{are affected by the}} intrinsic and extrinsic influences that vary within and between plants. I used the sequentially flowering, perennial herb, Stylidium armeria to explore reproductive success and sexual allocation over two flowering seasons at Lake Mountain, Victoria, Australia. The Haig and Westoby model predicts that plants should be simultaneously limited by both pollen and resources. I tested this model using a fully factorial experiment that manipulated both pollen and resources. Seed number increased at the whole-plant level when pollen and resources were added simultaneously, but not when added separately, a result in accord with the predictions of the Haig and Westoby model. Internal effects can also influence reproductive success: earlier flowers can pre-empt resources that could be allocated to later flowers, or architectural constraints could occur when shoot ontogeny creates constraints. Distal flowers and fruits within inflorescences tended to have lower biomass. Racemes with a large initial investment in basal flowers allocated less towards ovules and seeds in distal flowers compared to racemes with a smaller initial investment, suggesting a trade off between initial and subsequent allocation, consistent with the resource pre-emption hypothesis. The magnitude of the trade-off was altered by resource manipulations, but the trade-off was never removed. Together with the decline in floral and fruit biomass, this decline implies that architectural effects occur. This pattern suggests that investment in S. armeria is jointly constrained by both resources and architectural effects. The mating environment hypothesis predicts that the sex ratio of a population will greatly influence reproductive success in dichogamous plants. To test this, I observed the phenology of S. armeria and asked whether changes in the pollen/ovule ratio throughout the flowering season influenced female fitness. Protandry resulted in the floral sex ratio becoming more female as the flowering season progressed. In addition, flowers had relatively greater male allocation {{towards the end of the}} season, and those plants with a late first flowering date were more male, in agreement with theoretical predictions for protandrous plants. Consistent with the mating environment hypothesis, I found that when there was lower competition for male flowers in the population, the probability of fruit set increased. Phenological patterns can affect sex allocation, as plants with different first flowering date (FFD) or flowering duration can be exposed to different selective pressures. I found that plants with an earlier FFD had a greater calyx mass and seed number and invested more in seed and fruit mass. These results suggest that it might be adaptive for maternal fitness to flower earlier in the season. Female fitness in S. armeria is the result of <b>intrinsic</b> <b>resource</b> and architectural constraints and extrinsic competition in the mating environment. The study has contributed to our knowledge on the interaction of pollen and resource on plant reproduction and furthered our understanding of the contribution of mating environment in determining female fitness...|$|E
