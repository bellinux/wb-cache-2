40|$|In {{order to}} make a long rail of high carbon steel for railroad, about 300 m long rails are {{prepared}} in shop of JNR by flash butt welding. After that enclosed are welding or telmit welding are used in the field but in some case only enclosed are welding is used to build up a long rail. The life of <b>heat-treated</b> <b>rail</b> is three to five times of as rolled rail. Today, commonly speaking, only as rolled rails are used to make a long rail. However, heat-treated long rails are desired at private railways. Therefore, fatigue characteristics of both as rolled and heat-treated rails are investigated and the latter showed better fatigue properties. Impact properties of as rolled rails are reported in the previous report and those of heat-treated rails are investigated now. Impact properties of heat-treated rails seem to be better than those of as rolled ones. These results will be reported in the next paper...|$|E
40|$|In this study, an {{ultrasonic}} nanocrystalline {{surface modification}} (UNSM) technique {{was applied to}} normal and heat-treated rails made of 60 kgK steel to enhance the wear resistance of the wheel-rail interaction. The hardness and compressive residual stress values of the untreated and UNSM-treated rails were measured by the Brinell hardness tester and X-ray diffraction technique, respectively. It was found, according to the measurement results, that the hardness was increased by about 20 % and 8 %, whereas the compressive residual stress was induced by about 52 % and 62 % for the UNSM-treated normal and heat-treated rails, respectively. The UNSM-treated normal rail showed a slightly higher hardness than the <b>heat-treated</b> <b>rail.</b> The wear resistance of rails with respect to rotating speed and rolling time was assessed using a rolling contact wear (RCW) tester under dry conditions. The RCW test results revealed that the wear of the UNSM-treated rails was enhanced in comparison {{with those of the}} untreated rails. Also, the wear amount of the rails was increased with increasing the rotation speed. The UNSM-treated normal rail exhibited the highest wear resistance with respect to the rotation speed. The wear mechanisms of the rails are also discussed based on microscopic images of the worn out surfaces...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays, {{on account}} of the public harm and other reasons, a {{railroad}} is thought better of and is gradually developing in spite of the progress of an automobile and an airplane. A railroad line {{is one of the most}} important elements upon comfortability, safety, maintenance and expenses of a railroad. It is the most difficult point that we make a railroad line by weldipg as long as we can, and there is a hard problem in the welding. It is said that a rail with the sorbite structure, a rail with heat-treated head, has about treble as long life as a general rail with the pearlite structute, (though it also depends upon a curved radius,) but, at present, only the welding of a general rail is put to practical use. We would like to research into the welding of the rail with heat-treated head someday. But at first, by using the same materials the rail, we used the heat-treat materials as base ones which were changed into those with the same sorbite structure and the same hardness as the <b>heat-treated</b> <b>rail.</b> In order to synthesize the welded heat-affected zone, from the temperature of 600 ℃ to 1300 ℃, we heated and air cooled those materials every 100 ℃. We investigated the impact properties of those and also of the base materials. As a result of this, the best is that heated and air cooled at 700 ℃, and the worst is at 1300 ℃. We report the correlations the impact properties have with the microstructure and the grain size...|$|E
50|$|Rail {{corrugation}} may {{be prevented}} by selecting rails with material compositions {{that are more}} resistant to corrugation. <b>Heat-treated</b> alloy steel <b>rails</b> with relative hardness are the most resistant as opposed to Bessemer steels due to a greater relative hardness. Rails with a Brinell hardness of 320-360 are best for corrugation resistant rails. Trains may vary speed on the tracks {{in an effort to}} prevent corrugation from affecting sections or rail on a transit systems. Varying a train’s speed, direction, and tonnage are beneficial for combating the growth of rail, as corrugation is caused by continually uniform friction. On subways and major transit systems, {{it is not possible to}} vary the direction of trains, making the use of annual and bi-annual rail grinding processes more applicable.|$|R
5000|$|The Model 99 rifle is {{a single}} shot bullpup rifle that debuted in 1999. Its primary market was long range {{competitive}} target shooters and in 2001 a shooter set a world record at 1,000-yards with the M99 by shooting a 5-shot group which measured 4.09″. The M99 features a hard-core construction, 7000 series aluminum alloy extrusion, match-quality trigger design, <b>heat-treated</b> steel M1913 <b>rail,</b> match grade barrel, and S-7 tool steel bolt. It has three quick assembly pins, allowing it to be assembled or disassembled {{without the use of}} tools. The Model 99 is very accurate because of its heavy contour barrel. With the [...]416 round, the accuracy and increased velocity compared to [...]50 BMG enables greater long range precision. The bolt is machined from a single piece of S-7 tool steel. To make the rifle very reliable and easy to maintain, the Model 99 has just three moving parts: the extractor, ejector and firing pin assembly. For bench rest shooting, the bi-pod can be detached easily. The design of the trigger is virtually maintenance free. The barrel is locked into the extrusion by being hydraulically pressed, allowing the user to mount a rifle scope on it. The steel gun barrel and the aluminum extrusion surround the cartridge, making the firearm safer.|$|R
40|$|Plastic {{ratcheting}} plays a {{key role}} in causing rolling contact failure of rails. Due to demanding conditions imposed by rail transport of mineral products, the main aim of this research is to quantify cyclic plasticity for investigating the plastic deformation behaviour of high strength rail steels currently used in heavy haul railways in Australia. Three high strength rail steels with similar nominal hardness but different chemical composition were considered. Experimental studies were first carried out to investigate the ratcheting behaviour of the three rail steels subjected to uniaxial and non-proportional bi-axial compression-torsion cyclic loading conditions. The results show that an obvious cyclic softening occurs in all three rail steels under uniaxial strain cycling. Under uniaxial stress cycling, the materials behave slightly different under tension and compression. Under bi-axial compression-torsion stress cycling, both ratcheting strain and ratcheting strain rate are strongly influenced by the non-proportional loading paths. Among all three rail steels, the low alloy <b>heat-treated</b> <b>rail</b> steel grade has a better resistance to ratcheting than the two hypereutectoid rail steel grades. To quantify plastic ratcheting of the three rail steels, an existing cyclic plasticity model was modified by coupling a non-proportional multi-axial parameter into isotropic softening and kinematic hardening rules. The method to calibrate the material parameters for the plasticity model and the simulated results were validated with experimental data for the three studied rail steels. Comparisons between the simulated results and the experimental data show that the modified cyclic plasticity model has the capacity to simulate both uniaxial and bi-axial ratcheting behaviour of the three rail steels with an acceptable accuracy. A comprehensive study was carried out to evaluate the ratcheting performance of the three rail steels under different wheel-rail cyclic rolling contact conditions, i. e. free rolling, partial slip, and full slip conditions, different friction coefficient and different axle load with the use of the developed constitutive plasticity material model. The results indicate that the crack initiation life decreases with the increase of the normalized tangential traction, the friction coefficient and the axle load for all three rail steels. Additionally, the results demonstrate that the possible location of crack initiation is within the depth of 3 mm from the running surface of the rail head. Among the three rail steels, the hypereutectoid rail steel grade with the lower carbon content is the best one to apply in heavy haul railway for higher axle load in order to fulfil the demanding conditions imposed by railway transport of mineral products in Australia due to its consistent ratcheting performance under different rolling contact conditions. A single parameter, the maximum SWT parameter, which originated from the strain-life phenomenological approach, Smith-Watson-Topper (SWT) method, for multiaxial fatigue analysis, was proposed to evaluate the stress state in the rail head for assessing the fatigue integrity of the structure. A numerical procedure to determine the maximum SWT parameter was presented and applied in a case study. The capability of the maximum SWT parameter to predict fatigue crack initiation in the rail head was confirmed in the case study. Analogous to von Mises stress for strength analysis, the maximum SWT parameter can be applied to evaluate fatigue loading state. This doctoral study systematically investigates the ratcheting behaviour and quantified cyclic plasticity of the three rail steels currently used in heavy haul railways in Australia. A constitutive plasticity material model for ratcheting and a systematic program to evaluate ratcheting performance of rail steels under service loading are developed. A better understanding of the influence of wheel-rail rolling contact conditions and alloy design on the ratcheting performance of rail steels is gained. The outcomes of this study can provide useful information to the development and application of rail steels and the development of effective rail maintenance strategies in order to mitigate rail degradation...|$|E
