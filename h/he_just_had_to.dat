2500|$|With Farnham, Little River Band {{recorded}} three studio albums, {{which had}} modest success – {{not enough to}} pay back the advances the record company had provided. The first studio album, The Net, was already written and Farnham had no say in the songs, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> record his lead vocals. In the US, charting albums with Farnham's vocals, were Greatest Hits (1982), The Net (1983) and Playing to Win (1984) on Billboard Pop Albums chart/Billboard 200. While charting singles were, [...] "The Other Guy", [...] "We Two", [...] "You're Driving Me Out of My Mind" [...] and [...] "Playing to Win". Farnham's biggest Australian hits with LRB were the 1982 single [...] "Down on the Border" [...] which peaked at No. 7 and The Net which peaked at No. 11 on the albums charts in 1983.|$|E
60|$|Late that {{afternoon}} Peter visited the Old Orchard, for <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> tell Jenny Wren {{all about what}} he had seen that morning.|$|E
6000|$|Peter had to {{turn his}} head aside to hide the wry face <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make {{at the mention of}} such things as food. [...] "Is that all Welcome Robin eats?" [...] he asked innocently.|$|E
5000|$|Takami met Akira at a piano lesson. Though he is {{two years}} younger, 3rd year {{in middle school}} {{as well as a}} talented pianist. He has {{numerous}} first place trophies from piano competitions. In addition, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> hear a song in order to play it.|$|R
5000|$|This game form is straightforward: {{whatever}} {{the preferences of}} a voter, he has a dominant strategy that consists in declaring his sincere preference order. It is also dictatorial, and its dictator is voter 1: if his wishes to see candidate [...] elected, then <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> communicate a preference order where [...] is the unique most-liked candidate.|$|R
5000|$|Authorities believe Ruffo still <b>has</b> access <b>to</b> {{substantial}} overseas financial resources, {{which could}} be aiding him {{in his ability to}} stay off-the-grid and assume a new identity. Chief Deputy US Marshall John Bolen commented in 2013, [...] "Having been sentenced to 220 months of incarceration and not serving a single day of that kind of sticks in the craw of those of us in this profession. His actions are a mockery to our justice system. We are {{the best in the world}} at this. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make one mistake. We can make many but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> make one. We'll catch him". In 2007, Ruffo's last attorney, Jeffery Lichtman, offered the following when asked if he thought authorities would ever capture his former client: [...] "I think if I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> be a betting man, I'd put my money on John Ruffo. Because from what I can see so far, he is smarter than the people looking for him." ...|$|R
60|$|At last Jerry {{could stand}} it no longer. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{see what was}} going on. He slipped into the water and swam over to where the water was muddiest. Just as he got there up came Paddy.|$|E
60|$|Jerry {{watched a}} little while and then, because Jerry is a worker himself, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get busy and help. Rather timidly he told his big cousin {{that he would like}} to have a share in {{building}} the new house.|$|E
60|$|Now Danny Meadow Mouse {{is fond of}} Grandfather Frog, and he couldn't bear {{to think}} that {{something}} dreadful might happen to him. So when he found that he couldn't get Grandfather Frog {{to go back to}} the Smiling Pool, he made up his mind that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go along with Grandfather Frog to try to keep him out of danger. Yes, Sir, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> do it. He felt re-spon-sible for Grandfather Frog's safety. So here they were, Danny Meadow Mouse running ahead, anxious and worried and watching sharply for signs of danger, and Grandfather Frog puffing along behind, bound to see the Great World which his cousin, old Mr. Toad, said was a better place to live in than the Smiling Pool.|$|E
6000|$|... "Because he can't help himself. No slave ever wants <b>to</b> obey, but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to.</b> And it isn't {{dirty work}} at all. You don't black the royal boots and shoes, you merely blue {{them with a}} finely perfumed blue paste. Then you shine them neatly and your task is done. You will not be humiliated by {{becoming}} a bootblack. You'll be a bootblue." ...|$|R
25|$|After 100 hours {{according}} to Terence's clock, Stella enters a dark region. She has traveled outside Terence's timelike future. On the other hand, Terence {{can continue to}} receive Stella's messages <b>to</b> him indefinitely. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> wait long enough. Spacetime has been divided into distinct regions separated by an apparent event horizon. So long as Stella continues to accelerate, she can never know what takes place behind this horizon.|$|R
50|$|Besides {{the remote}} control for the toilet bowl, John also has a remote control for his girlfriend Nelle Porter. Due to the {{significant}} height difference between the two, John invents remote controlled shoes for Nelle so <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> push a button for the heels of Nelle's shoes to shorten, thereby making Nelle shorter. Later on he also designs a remote control that controls Nelle's hair pins.|$|R
60|$|You see, Happy Jack was {{spying on}} Striped Chipmunk. Yes, Sir, Happy Jack was spying. Spying, you know, is {{secretly}} watching {{other people and}} {{trying to find out what}} they are doing. It isn't a nice thing to do, not a bit nice. Happy Jack knew it, and all the time he was doing it, he was feeling very much ashamed of himself. But he said to himself that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know where Striped Chipmunk's storehouse was, because <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> peep inside and find out if it held any of the big, fat hickory nuts that had disappeared from under the tall hickory tree while he was quarreling up in the top of it with his cousin, Chatterer the Red Squirrel.|$|E
60|$|But {{in spite}} of his frights, Whitefoot kept on. You see, he was more afraid to stop than he was to go on. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get as far from Shadow the Weasel as he could. Being such a little fellow, what would be a short {{distance}} for you or me is a long distance for Whitefoot.|$|E
6000|$|... "Bob--Bob White! Bob--Bob White! Bob--Bob White!" [...] {{clear and}} sweet, that call floated {{over to the}} dear Old Briar-patch until Peter could stand it no longer. He felt that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go over and pay an early morning call {{on one of his}} very best friends, who at this season of the year delights in {{whistling}} his own name--Bob White.|$|E

5000|$|After Mike's {{recovery}} in hospital, {{it seems he}} has given up—until Tony is bashed by Fox's head thug for riding a bicycle after Fox told them [...] "no wheels and off the street". Mike confronts Fox and challenges him to a race. Mike plans to race and bet Rebel's Chevy, he knows it will beat the Dodge - <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> convince Rebel to let him use it.|$|R
5000|$|Mohammad Ali Ikram of PlanetBollywood {{gave the}} film 7.0/10 and wrote [...] "Aa Ab Laut Chalen may be filmi in {{conveying}} the theme, {{but the point}} is presented with laudable conviction in the second half. Rediff noted [...] "Maybe Rishi Kapoor was bowing to RK tradition, maybe he was trying to follow his heart, but <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> get {{back to the drawing board}} and seriously plan that next venture".|$|R
6000|$|The more Peter studied over it, {{the more}} puzzled he grew. The next night {{he started out}} for the Green Forest with a new plan in his head. He would hide down among the alders by the Laughing Brook. He would see for himself who was {{screaming}} with the voice of Sammy Jay and talking with the voice of Sticky-toes the Tree Toad. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know! ...|$|E
60|$|Now a good honest laugh is like {{whooping}} cough--it is catching. The {{first thing}} Danny Meadow Mouse knew his tears would not come. It's a fact, Danny Meadow Mouse had run short of tears. The {{next thing he}} knew he wasn't crying at all--he was laughing. Yes, Sir, he actually was laughing. He tried to cry, but it was of no use at all; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> laugh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Rabbit trembled in {{his shoes}} when he got old Mother Nature's message. He {{would have liked to}} run away and hide. But he did not dare do that, for he knew that there was nowhere he could hide that Mother Nature would not find him sooner or later. And besides, his curiosity would give him no peace. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know what old Mother Nature wanted.|$|E
50|$|In {{case the}} prison {{director}} does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> distribute the numbers into the drawers randomly, he can foil the prisoners' strategy {{if he knows}} the numbering of the drawers. <b>To</b> this end, <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> ensure that his assignment of prisoners' numbers to drawers constitutes a permutation with a cycle of length larger than 50. The prisoners in turn can counter this by choosing their own numbering of the drawers randomly.|$|R
2500|$|In March 2006, Queen ElizabethII {{opened the}} western {{colonnade}} {{addition to the}} building designed by Utzon who <b>had</b> not returned <b>to</b> Australia since 1966. His son, Jan, took his place at the opening ceremony instead, saying his father was [...] "too old by now to take the long flight to Australia. But he lives and breathes the Opera House, and as its creator <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> close his eyes to see it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... and <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> it, {{even if it}} is overpriced, and not a {{legitimate}} hedge against inflation. Even if it is gold, it is possibly overpriced. But the medallion carries a curious coat of arms upon its face, and must have been minted privately by some noble family in Italy. And thus begins a long journey that takes him back to another mans life - and death - in Venice.|$|R
6000|$|Peter Rabbit had {{sat still}} {{just as long}} as he could. He was stiff and lame and sore from the wounds made by Hooty the Owl, but his curiosity wouldn't let him sit still a minute longer. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>HAD</b> <b>to</b> explore the Old Pasture. So with many a wry face and many an [...] "Ouch" [...] he limped out from the shelter of the {{friendly}} old bramble-bush and started out to see what the Old Pasture was like.|$|E
60|$|Flitter the Bat made Peter Rabbit's head dizzy. Peter couldn't help {{watching}} him. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to.</b> It {{seemed so}} wonderful that Flitter could really fly, that whenever he saw him, Peter {{had to stop}} and watch. And then, as he saw Flitter twist and turn, fly high, fly low, and go round and round, Peter's head would begin to swim and grow dizzy, and he wondered and wondered how it was that Flitter himself didn't grow dizzy.|$|E
60|$|Little by little, Chatterer {{began to}} understand. Farmer Brown's boy had made that wheel {{to give him}} a chance to run all he wanted to and {{whenever}} he wanted to. When he understood this, Chatterer was as nearly happy as he could be in a prison. It was such a pleasant surprise! He would race and race in it until <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> stop for breath. Farmer Brown's boy looked on and laughed to see how much happier he had made Chatterer.|$|E
50|$|Angel {{sits in a}} {{chair in}} the middle of a sunny field as the gang {{approach}} him. “You can stay as long as you like,” Wesley says. “Stay forever.” Angel says he’s not done with his job, but Wesley says that he can be if he wants to. Fred says that he’ll be fine - <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> stop caring. Suddenly, the four of them throw their heads back and scream.|$|R
5000|$|Antony Cotton {{said that}} playing Sean is easy because <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> act like himself. Speaking to The People, Cotton said that Sean looks and {{he sounds like}} him. Cotton later {{admitted}} {{that not all of}} the reviews about him are positive. Some of the gay press have accused Cotton of making Sean a stereotype. Of this he said, [...] "You've got people like Blanche Hunt, Emily Bishop and Norris Cole and there were the classic characters like Bet Lynch and Annie Walker. They're all more camp than Sean — I'm Grant Mitchell compared to them." ...|$|R
5000|$|Morte's {{weakness}} is female zombies. The game's initial project director Guido Henkel said: [...] "Let's say you're trying {{to sneak out}} of an area, {{when all of a}} sudden there a female zombie shows up. Morte, our nice little sarcastic skull, has a total thing for female zombies. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> shack up with them. And although you are trying to sneak out somewhere, Morte will walk right up to the zombie and start talking her up. That, of course, destroys your whole plan because you have no control over his actions at that point." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I--I--I'd like {{to taste}} one more nut before I starve to death," [...] muttered Chatterer, and almost without knowing it, {{he began to}} gnaw the hard shell. When that nut was finished, he found another; and when that was gone, still another. Then <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> taste a grain of corn. The first thing Chatterer knew, the nuts and the corn were all gone, and his stomach was full. Somehow he felt ever so much better. He didn't feel like {{starving}} to death now.|$|E
6000|$|... "At {{first he}} hunted silently, running swiftly with his {{nose to the}} ground. But this gave the ones he hunted very little chance; he was upon them before they even {{suspected}} {{that he was on}} their trail. It always made Mr. Wolf feel mean. He never could hold his head and his tail up after that kind of a hunt. He felt so like a sneak that <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> put his tail between his legs for very shame. There was nothing to be proud about in such a hunt.|$|E
60|$|Now {{there was}} some one else {{with a great deal}} of curiosity also. He had heard the {{screaming}} of Blacky the Crow and Sammy Jay, and he had listened until he couldn't stand it another minute. <b>He</b> <b>just</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> know what it was all about. So at the same time Farmer Brown's boy started for the Green Forest, this other listener started towards the place where Blacky and Sammy were making such a racket. He walked very softly so as not to make a sound. It was Buster Bear.|$|E
2500|$|... never <b>had</b> lessons, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>just</b> listened <b>to</b> others' pieces used {{improvisation}} ...|$|R
60|$|But Reddy is {{something}} of a philosopher. That fat hen was gone, and there was no use in wasting time puzzling over it. There were other fat hens where that one came from, and <b>he</b> would <b>just</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> catch another.|$|R
5000|$|... (For men only) Doing istibra' before ghusl janabat. Istibra', in {{the present}} context, means [...] "urinating." [...] The benefit of istibra': If a liquid comes out of one's penis after {{completing}} the ghusl, and he doubts whether it is semen or urine, then should he repeat the ghusl or not? If he had done istibra' before the ghusl, then he can assume that the liquid is urine he will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> repeat the ghusl; <b>he</b> <b>just</b> <b>has</b> <b>to</b> do wudu for his salat. But, on the other hand, {{if he had not}} done istibra' before the ghusl, then he <b>has</b> <b>to</b> assume that it is the remnant of semen he will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do the ghusl again.|$|R
