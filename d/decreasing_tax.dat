50|$|Governments use {{fiscal policy}} to {{influence}} the level of aggregate demand in the economy, {{in an effort to}} achieve economic objectives of price stability, full employment, and economic growth.

5000|$|Detroit Public Schools {{suffered}} from underfunding and racial discrimination before the riots. Underfunding was {{a function of}} a <b>decreasing</b> <b>tax</b> base as the population shrank while the numbers of students rose. From 1962 to 1966, enrollment grew from 283,811 to 294,653, but the loss of tax base made less funding available. At the same time, middle-class families were leaving the district, {{and the number of}} low-scoring and economically disadvantaged students, mostly black, were increasing. In 1966-67, the funding per pupil in Detroit was $193 compared to $225 per pupil in the suburbs. Exacerbating this inequity were the challenges in educating disadvantaged students. The Detroit Board of Education estimated it cost twice as much to educate a [...] "ghetto child properly as to educate a suburban child." [...] According to Michigan law in 1967, class sizes could not exceed thirty-five students, but in inner city schools they did, sometimes swelling to forty students per teacher. To have the same teacher/student ratio {{as the rest of the}} state, Detroit would have to hire 1,650 more teachers for the 1966-67 school year.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} the general nonlinear optimal income tax for couples, a multidimensional screening problem. Each couple {{consists of a}} primary earner who always participates in the labor market, but makes an hours-of-work choice, and a secondary earner who chooses {{whether or not to}} work. If second-earner participation is a signal of the couple being better (worse) off, we prove that optimal tax schemes display a positive tax (subsidy) on secondary earnings and that the tax (subsidy) on secondary earnings decreases with primary earnings and converges to zero asymptotically. We present calibrated microsimulations for the United Kingdom showing that <b>decreasing</b> <b>tax</b> rates on secondary earnings is quantitatively significant and consistent with actual income tax and transfer programs.

40|$|This paper investigates {{whether the}} size of multinationals? real {{investments}} in a high-tax country is affected by profit shifting activities. A simple theoretical analysis shows that tax rates abroad impact the cost of capital {{in the presence of}} profit shifting activities of multinational companies. As profit shifting opportunities constitute a competitive advantage, the respective size of investments should theoretically increase if profits can be shifted to a lower taxing country. An empirical analysis, based on a panel of German inbound investments, confirms a positive tax response of real investments with a <b>decreasing</b> <b>tax</b> rate at the foreign direct investor?s home country. Hence, the results suggest that {{the size of}} foreign investments in a high-tax country is positively affected by lower foreign taxation of shifted profits.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} labor {{tax evasion}} {{and the impact}} of labor inspectorate auditing. The analysis is based on a unique dataset built by linking two important sources of information: a) a dataset of individual artisan firms, b) an individual audit dataset. Our data describe the universe of artisan firms in Piedmont (Italy) in 2000 - 2005. Using information on firm characteristics and tax evasion, observed directly from the audit exercise, we: a) estimate undeclared work in the artisan sector; and b) evaluate the impact of tax inspections on employer labor tax declarations. Relying on a double hurdle selection model we find that the artisan sector includes around 14 % of undeclared workers. We find also that inspections could be counterproductive, <b>decreasing</b> <b>tax</b> revenues and not increasing non compliance. JEL Classification...|$|E

However, the effect of the reform varied quite substantially between communities.
