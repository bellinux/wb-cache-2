The phenotypes are controlled by multiple alleles at one locus. These polymorphisms are seemingly never eliminated by natural selection; the reason came from a study of disease statistics.|$|E
25|$|Book 3 {{relates the}} history of Babylon from Nabonassaros to Antiochus I (presumably). Again, {{it is likely that}} he used king-lists, though it is not known which ones he used. The Mesopotamian {{documents}} known as King-List A (one copy from the 6th or 5th centuries BC) and Chronicle 1 (3 copies with one confidently dated to 500 BC) are usually suggested as the ones he used, due to the synchronicity between those and his History (though there are some differences). A large part of his history around the time of Naboukhodonosoros (Nebuchadnezzar II, 604562 BC) and Nabonnedos (Nabonidus, 556539 BC) survives. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> his interpretation of history for the first time, moralising about the success and failure of kings based on their moral conduct. This is similar to another Babylonian history, Chronicle of Nabonidus (as well as to the Hebrew Bible), and differs from the rationalistic accounts of other Greek historians like Thucydides.|$|E

25|$|Factors such {{as nature}} {{of work and}} lack of {{influence}} within their jobs leads some theorists {{to the conclusion that}} most Americans are working class. They have data that shows the majority of workers are not paid to share their ideas. These workers are closely supervised and do not enjoy independence in their jobs. Also, they are not paid to think. For example: The median annual earnings of salaried dentists were $136,960 in May 2006, indicating a high degree of scarcity for qualified personnel. The opinions and thoughts of dentists, much like those of other professionals, are sought after by their organizations and clients. The dentist creates a diagnosis, consults the patient, and conceptualizes a treatment. In 2009, Dental assistants made roughly $14.40 an hour, about $32,000 annually. Unlike dentists, dental assistants do not have much influence over the treatment of patients. They carry out routine procedures and follow the dentists' instructions. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> that a dental assistant being classified as working class. Similar relationships can be observed in other occupations.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} Banker to the Poor: Micro-lending and the Battle Against World Poverty, Muhammad Yunus shows the outlook behind why Grameen Bank runs {{the way it}} does, saying, “ When you hold the world in your palm and inspect it only from a birds eye view, you tend to become arrogant, you do not realize things become blurred when viewed from an {{enormous}} distance. I opted instead for the” worms eye view.” … [...] The poor taught me an entirely new economics. I learned about the problems they face from their own perspective. “ <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> his willingness to immerse himself with the people he is aiming to help. [...] We get our first look at Muhammad Yunus's perception of the absolute poor when he meets Sufiya Begum, a bamboo stool maker who was trapped in poverty's vicious cycle {{due to a lack}} of 27 cents. That is where we find that what will become Grameen bank, is founded upon one man's heart for those that society and big corporations could or would not help. [...] Taking productive action, Yunus worked with the banks and community around to empower people like Sufiya to be able to apply for credit, and use it in the best and most productive way that she knows how in her unique situation. [...] Grameen Bank would need to be a bank of unusual standards. It would have to be, as Yunus put it, [...] "an institution that would lend to those that had nothing. [...] " [...] Later, as time progressed, more situations would arise, such as battling for those who were landless, or small-time farmers such as those in Jobra who could not use a deep tube-well that was available to them.|$|E

2500|$|The {{psychometrician}} L. L. Thurstone, {{founder and}} {{first president of}} the Psychometric Society in 1936, developed and applied a theoretical approach to measurement referred to as the law of comparative judgment, an approach that has close connections to the psychophysical theory of Ernst Heinrich Weber and Gustav Fechner. In addition, Spearman and Thurstone both made important contributions to the theory and application of factor analysis, a statistical method developed and used extensively in psychometrics. In the late 1950s, Leopold Szondi made an historical and epistemological assessment of the impact of statistical thinking onto psychology during previous few decades: [...] "in the last decades, the specifically psychological thinking has been almost completely suppressed and removed, and replaced by a statistical thinking.

2500|$|Many critics {{regard the}} protagonists in Beckett's novel Mercier and Camier as prototypes of Vladimir and Estragon.

[...] <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> the agonised protagonist yearning for self-knowledge, or at least {{complete}} freedom of thought at any cost, and the dichotomy and interaction of mind and body. Mercier and Camier wander aimlessly about a boggy, rain-soaked island that, although not explicitly named, is Beckett's native Ireland. They speak convoluted dialogues similar to Vladimir and Estragon's, joke about the weather and chat in pubs, while the purpose of their odyssey is never made clear. The waiting in Godot is the wandering of the novel. [...] "There are large chunks of dialogue which he later transferred directly into Godot." ...|$|E

There is no part of my inward life that has not had new light shed upon it, or been stimulated, by the lofty teachings of Rudolf Steiner ... I am profoundly grateful for having been so boundlessly enriched ... It is glorious to become a learner again at my time of life. I have a sense of the rejuvenation of my whole being which gives strength and renewal to my musicianship, even to my music-making." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Rhind Papyrus, {{also known}} as the Ahmes Papyrus, is an ancient Egyptian papyrus written c. 1650BCE by Ahmes, who {{transcribed}} it from an earlier work that he dated to between 2000 and 1800BCE. It is the most extensive ancient Egyptian mathematical document known to historians. The Rhind Papyrus contains problems where linear equations of the form [...] and [...] are solved, where a, b, and c are known and x, which is referred to as [...] "aha" [...] or heap, is the unknown. or , where a and b and c are known and x is unknown. The unknown is referred to as [...] "aha," [...] or heap. [...] The solution given by Ahmes is not that of modern textbooks, but one proposed characteristic of a procedure now known as the [...] "method of false position," [...] or the [...] "rule of false." [...] A specific false value has been proposed by 1920s scholars and the operations indicated on the left hand side of the equality sign are performed on this assumed number. Recent scholarship shows that scribes had not guessed in these situations. Exact rational number answers written in Egyptian fraction series had confused the 1920s scholars. The attested result shows that Ahmes [...] "checked" [...] result by showing that 16 + 1/2 + 1/8 exactly added to a seventh of this (which is 2 + 1/4 + 1/8), does obtain 19. <b>Here</b> <b>we</b> <b>see</b> another significant step in the development of mathematics, for the check is a simple instance of a proof." [...] The solutions were possibly, but not likely, arrived at by using the [...] "method of false position", or regula falsi, where first a specific value is substituted into the left hand side of the equation, then the required arithmetic calculations are done, thirdly the result is compared to the right hand side of the equation, and finally the correct answer is found through the use of proportions. In some of the problems the author [...] "checks" [...] his solution, thereby writing one of the earliest known simple proofs.|$|E
