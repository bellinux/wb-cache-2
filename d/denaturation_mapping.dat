50|$|<b>Denaturation</b> <b>Mapping</b> {{is a form}} {{of optical}} mapping, first {{described}} in 1966. It is used to characterize DNA molecules without the need for amplification or sequencing. It is based on the differences between the melting temperatures of AT-rich and GC-rich regions. Even though modern sequencing methods reduced the need for <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping,</b> it is still being used for specific purposes, such as detection of large scale structural variants.|$|E
50|$|Main {{advantage}} of <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> is that large-scale {{organization of the}} genome is left intact during the process. That means long-range structural variants can be detected easily.|$|E
5000|$|When {{subjected}} to denaturing factors like increased heat or chemicals like formamide in low levels, DNA is partially denatured in a predictable pattern {{based on its}} nucleotide content in different regions. This allows unique fingerprints or ‘barcodes' to be generated for molecules with different sequences not unlike restriction mapping. In the earliest forms of <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping,</b> DNA was denatured by heating in presence of formaldehyde [...] or glyoxal and visualized using electron microscopy. Dyes that selectively bind to double stranded DNA like ethidium bromide {{could be used to}} monitor the extent of denaturation. But {{it was not possible to}} observe locations of denaturation based on this information. And requirement of electron microscopy made this method more strenuous to perform.More recently microfluidics were used for <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> of single molecules. In this method a reservoir that contains individual stained DNA molecules is placed next to nanochannels. Under pressure the molecules are pushed towards the nanochannels, and stretch out. With the application of heat in the presence of formamide the molecules denature and while in these channels, denaturation profile of these molecules can be observed by fluorescence microscopy.|$|E
40|$|A {{formaldehyde}} <b>denaturation</b> <b>map</b> of the {{replicative form}} of #xl 74 DNA is obtained. The RFI DNA was {{converted into a}} linear state by restriction endonuclease pst I which introduces into this DNA a single double-stranded break. The map has four clear-cut peaks. Their positions excel-lently correlate with the peak positions on the <b>map</b> of equilibrium <b>denaturation</b> theoretically obtained earlier from the known nucleotide sequence of 0 xlV 4 DNA. The se-quence is also used for a calculation of the maps of smoo-thed AT-content. The maxima on these maps correlate well with the peaks on the <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps.</b> To reveal the causes of a good correlation between the experimental for-maldehyde and theoretical equilibrium <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps,</b> the theoretical formaldehyde <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps</b> are calcu-lated for different conditions (temperature, formaldehyde concentration) using the detailed theory of DNA interaction with formaldehyde developed earlier...|$|R

40|$|Optical {{mapping of}} DNA {{provides}} large-scale genomic {{information that can}} be used to assemble contigs from next-generation sequencing, and to detect rearrangements between single cells. A recent optical mapping technique called <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> has the advantage of using physical principles rather than the action of enzymes to probe genomic structure. <b>Denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> uses fluorescence microscopy to image the pattern of partial melting along a DNA molecule extended in a channel of cross-section 120 nm at the heart of a nanofluidic device. We used <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> to locate single DNA molecules on the yeast genome (12. 1 Mbp) by comparing images to a computationally predicted map for the entire genome sequence.

40|$|The R factor NR 1 {{consists}} of two components: a resistance transfer factor which harbors the tetracycline resistance genes (RTF-TC) and the r-determinants component which harbors the other drug resistance genes. Using partial <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> {{it is possible to}} distinguish the RTF-TC region from the r-determinants region of the composite R factor NR 1 DNA which has a contour length of 37 mum and a density of 1. 712 g/ml. The r-determinants region was a relatively undenatured 8. 5 -mum segment of the molecule when the deoxyribonucleic acid was partially denatured at pH 10. 7. An RTF-TC genetic segregant of NR 1 which had lost the r-determinants component had a contour length of 28. 7 mum and a density of 1. 710 g/ml. Characterization of an RTF-TC using partial <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping</b> at pH 10. 7 confirmed that the relatively undenatured 8. 5 -mum r-determinants segment of the composite R factor had been deleted. Circular, transitioned NR 1 DNA molecules (1. 716 to 1. 718 g/ml), whose contour lengths were consistent with an RTF-TC plus an integral number of tandem copies of r-determinants, were also characterized by <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping.</b> The relatively undenatured region in these molecules had a length equal to an integral number of copies of r-determinants and was located at the same site in the partially denatured RTF-TC as the single copy of r-determinants in the 37 -mum composite NR 1. This indicates that there is a unique integration site for r-determinants in the RTF-TC component. The R factor UCR 122, a TC deletion mutant of NR 1, was also characterized by <b>denaturation</b> <b>mapping.</b> The translocation of the TC resistance gene(s) on the denaturation map permitted the alignment of the denaturation map with the heteroduplex map of Sharp et al. (u 073). Linear and circular monomeric and presumed multimeric r-determinants DNA molecules (p = 1. 718 g/ml) were partially denatured at a higher pH (11. 10). The r-determinants multimers showed a repeating 8. 3 -mum (monomeric) partial denaturation pattern indicating a head-to-tail arrangement of monomers in these poly-r-determinant molecules...|$|E

40|$|Denatured {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) from a grande (wild-type) yeast {{strain and}} a series of derived genetically characterized cytoplasmic petite mutants was examined in the electron microscope as DNA-protein monolayers prepared under conditions that permitted little bimolecular renaturation. In the grande and some petite strains, the mtDNA remained predominantly single-stranded. However, in several petite strains, a large proportion of molecules contained double-stranded segments indicative of unimolecular renaturation due to the presence of inverted repeat sequences. The length of the double-stranded segments of strain E 41 was compared to the periodicity seen on <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps.</b> A repeat spacing twice the length of the inverted repeats was observed in the <b>denaturation</b> <b>map.</b> Inverted repeat length was similar to contour length of circular mtDNA molecules in this strain. On the basis of these observations most of the mtDNA from petite strain E 41 appeared to consist of polymers of tandem inverted repeats interspersed with a small single-stranded “spacer” sequence between the repeat segments. In contrast, petite strain F 13 mtDNA had few or no inverted repeats and showed a regular periodicity of 0. 14 μm in the <b>denaturation</b> <b>map,</b> similar in length to the 0. 13 -μm circles present in the isolated mtDNA...|$|R
40|$|After isolation, the DNA of {{simian virus}} 40 {{appeared}} as a negative supertwist (form I) or as an open circle {{with at least one}} single-strand scission (form II). Under the denaturation conditions usually applied, such as heating in the presence of formaldehyde or application of alkali, form I molecules could appear as "relaxed" circles without single-strand scissions (form I') containing denatured sites not visible under the electron microscope. Form II molecules, under these denaturation conditions, showed partial or complete strand separations allowing the construction of <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps.</b> By using a modified denaturation procedure, i. e., heating of isolated SV 40 DNA in the presence of dimethyl sulfoxide and formaldehyde followed by keeping the DNA in this denaturation solution at room temperature for periods up to 3 weeks, partially denatured relaxed circles without single-strand scissions were produced (form I'D) in addition to completely denatured form II molecules. The absence of single-strand scissions in form I'D molecules was demonstrated by a second heat treatment, which did not change the configuration of this molecular form. Form I'D molecules, in contrast to form I', contained denatured sites clearly discerible under the electron microscope. This combined application of two subsequent denaturation steps (denaturation by heating followed by denaturation at room temperature and neutral pH) showed that the molecular configuration I'D originated in two steps. The heating procedure produced molecules not distinquishable by electron microscopy from form I. In contrast to form I, these molecules were assumed to possess "preformed" denaturation sites (form I). Further treatment of form I molecules with denaturation solution at room temperature finally transformed them into convalently closed, relaxed, partially denatured circles exhibiting strand separations easily measurable on electron micrographs (form I'D). <b>Denaturation</b> <b>maps</b> of form I'D molecules were constructed by computer and compared with <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps</b> derived from partially denatured form II molecules. From these <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps</b> it can be concluded that the melting of base pairs occurring during the transition of simian virus 40 DNA form I into form I'D also preferentially happened at sites rich in the bases adenosine and thymine...|$|R

Similarly, from the <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps</b> of the short unique region, the molecules were divided into two groups each comprising 15 molecules.

DNA isolated from unfertilized eggs shows nuclear and mitochondrial DNA in equal proportions; {{we found no}} evidence of other cytoplasmic species. Confusion as to which of the satellite DNA peaks of Drosophila are cytoplasmic (4, 12) has been resolved in an analysis (17) which has shown that two (1. 688 and 1. 672 g/cm a) of the three distinct light satellites are of nuclear origin and that the remaining one (1. 680 g/cm a) is of cytoplasmic origin.

Optical denaturation curves and temperature-gradient gel mobility curves were simulated using the <b>denaturation</b> <b>maps</b> and were compared with experimental results from optical melting and temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis (Tien Po et al., accompanying paper). Melting of the dsRNAs starts from {{both ends of the}} molecule in two transitions of low co-operativity, continues in the right part in a highly co-operative transition, and is finished in another highly co-operative transition including strand-separation. Whereas all parts of the molecule contribute uniformly to the optical melting curve, opening of the ends predominates in the retardation transition in gel electrophoresis. Detailed discussion of the influence of base pair changes in the sequence shows that a single base pair change may be detected by temperature-gradient gel electrophoresis, if it is located in certain favorable locations, whereas its detection in optical melting curves is possible only in very special cases.
