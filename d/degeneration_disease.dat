50|$|Mutations in ABCA4 gene {{are known}} to cause the autosomal-recessive disease Stargardt macular {{dystrophy}} (STGD), which is a hereditary juvenile macular <b>degeneration</b> <b>disease</b> causing progressive loss of photoreceptor cells. STGD is characterized by reduced visual acuity and color vision, loss of central (macular) vision, delayed dark adaptation, and accumulation of autoflourescent RPE lipofuscin. Removal of NR-PE/ATR appears to be significant in normal bleach recovery and to mitigate persistent opsin signaling that causes photoreceptors to degenerate. ABCA4 also mitigates long-term effects of accumulation of ATR that results in irreversible ATR binding to a second molecule of ATR and NR-PE to form dihydro-N-retinylidene-N-retinyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (A2PE-H2). A2PE-H2 traps ATR and accumulates in outer segments to further oxidize into N-retinylidene-N-retinyl-phosphatidyl-ethanolamine (A2PE). After diurnal disk-shedding and phagocytosis of outer segment by RPE cells, A2PE is hydrolyzed inside the RPE phagolysosome to form A2E. Accumulation of A2E causes toxicity at the primary RPE level and secondary photoreceptor destruction in macular degenerations.|$|E

In this study, we used high-resolution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to reveal a mini-dumbbell structure formed by two CCTG repeats. Upon slippage in the nascent strand during DNA replication, {{the formation of the}} mini-dumbbell provides a possible pathway for a two-repeat expansion. In addition, fast exchange between two competing mini-dumbbells among three repeats results in a mini-loop structure that accounts for one-repeat expansion. These mini-dumbbell and mini-loop intermediates can also co-exist at multiple sites in CCTG repeats, leading to three or larger size repeat expansions...|$|E

30|$|The retinal pigment {{epithelium}} (RPE) is a pigmented monolayer of epithelium residing outside of the neurosensory retina where it supports metabolic and cellular processes of retinal photoreceptors.

Ligustrazine, an alkaloid from Chuanxiong, reportedly is able to relieve pain, suppress inflammation, and treat osteoarthritis and it has the protective effect on cartilage and chondrocytes. Therefore, we asked whether ligustrazine could reduce intervertebral disc degeneration. To determine the effect of ligustrazine on disc degeneration, we applied a rat model. The intervertebral disc degeneration of the rats was induced by prolonged upright posture. We found that pretreatment with ligustrazine for 1 month recovered the structural distortion of the degenerative disc; inhibited the expression of type X collagen, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) - 13, and MMP 3; upregulated type II collagen; and decreased IL- 1 β, cyclooxygenase (COX) - 2, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) expression.

In C. elegans, these drugs were shown to interact with CAH- 4, a putative carbonic anhydrase.

40|$|Obtaining and {{manipulating}} neuronal {{cells are}} critical for neural biology basic mechanism studies and translational applications. Recent advances in protocol development and mechanism dissections have made direct induction of neuronal cells from other somatic cells (iN) a promising strategy for such purposes. In this study, we established a protocol to expand a population of fibroblast-like cells from adult human retinal tissues, which can be reprogrammed into iNs by forced expression of neurogenic transcription factors. Interestingly, the combination of Ascl 1, Brn 2, Myt 1 l, and NeuroD 1 transcription factors, which has been demonstrated to be sufficient to reprogram human embryonic and dermal fibroblasts into iNs, failed to reprogram the fibroblast-like cells from human retinas into iNs. Instead, supplementing Ascl 1 with Pax 6 sufficed to convert the cells into iNs, which exhibited a typical neuronal morphology, expressed neural marker genes, displayed active and passive neuronal membrane activities, and made synaptic communications with other neurons. Moreover, iNs converted from retina-derived fibroblast-like cells contained high ratios of γ-Aminobutyric acid- (GABA-) and tyrosine hydroxylase- (TH-) positive neurons. Thus, the present study proposes a protocol that makes use of discarded retinal tissues from eye banks for iN generation, and suggests that different sources of somatic cells require different iN induction recipes and may also affect the iN subtype outputs.

A validated three-dimensional model of an intact, healthy, adult full cervical spine (C 1 -C 7) (INT) was constructed. This model was then modified to create two models, one simulating each of the above-men-tioned two techniques for discectomy of the severely degenerated C 5 -C 6 disc. For each of these three models, we used the finite element analysis method to obtain three biomechanical parameters at various tissues in the model, under seven different physio-logically relevant loadings. For each of the biome-chanical parameters, the results were expressed as relative change in its value when a specified combi-nation of simulated discectomy model and applied loading was used, with respect to the corresponding value in the intact model. We then computed the value of a composite biomechanical performance in-dex (CBPI) for CONDIS and MIVDIS models, with this value incorporating all of the aforementioned relative changes. We found that CBPI was marginally lower for MIVDIS model. This trend is the same as that reported for the relative complications rate and outcome measures following conventional and mini-mally-invasive discectomies in the lumbar spine. From a healthcare perspective, one implication of our finding is that minimally-invasive cervical discectomy should be considered an attractive option provided that detailed patient selection criteria are clearly de-fined and strictly followed...|$|E

Intervertebral disc degeneration of the cervical spine affects over {{one half of}} all individuals {{over the age of}} 40 years and the last decade has seen an alarming increase in cervical disc degenerative disease related surgeries. In spite of newer technological advancements in devices for disc <b>degeneration</b> <b>disease,</b> spinal disc replacement and fusion, revision surgery rates have remained unchanged. 90 % of the disc replacement revisions and 50 % of fusion related revision can be attributed to improper device selection. Therefore, the objective of this research is to evaluate disc arthroplasty (replacement) and arthrodesis (fusion) devices and identify optimal implant size (height) selection criteria for biomechanical competence in force transmission, motion, and neurologic tissue protection. Eleven osteo-ligamentous human cadaver cervical spines were biomechanically evaluated after surgical augmentation with different sized implants for both arthroplasty and arthrodesis. The biomechanical outcomes measured were range of motion, neutral zone, stiffness, articular pillar strains, facet forces and intervertebral foramen area. Increased disc distraction was found to increase lordosis of the spine, increase compressive strains in articular pillars and increase in intervertebral foramen area. The kinematics outcomes were surgery type and implant size dependent where fusion lead to decreased range of motion, while arthroplasty maintained the range of motion with differential outcomes based upon the size of the implant. The integration of these biomechanical data demonstrate an implant size /spacer height relationship with direct clinical importance and the ability to guide clinical decision making so as to reduce revision surgery due to deviant biomechanical function...|$|E

The effectiveness of treatment and prophylaxis are considerably decreased by late diagnostics of spine <b>degeneration</b> <b>diseases.</b> Knowledge about the changes of mechanical properties of vertebrae {{during the period of}} influence of old or under the influence of pathological processes are necessary for the development of early diagnostics. The goal of our work is to denote the acoustic and strength properties and its connectedness of vertebrae bone tissue in order to work out an early diagnostics method - osteopenetrometry - of spine degenerative diseases. Experimental researches for denoting ultrasound velocity, acoustic anizotropy and penetration strength are made with 60 saples of cortical and trabecular vertebrae bone tissue. The changes of penetration strength during the intensive load have been denoted in clinical observations of 120 athletes. The changes of penetration strength of vertebral trabecular tissue and intraosal circulation of blood have been denoted for 700 patients with different stages of degenerative diseases. Experimental researches showed that cortical and trabecular vertebrae bone tissue are characteristic with anizotropy and heterogeneousity of acoustic and strength properties for the age group from 20 to 40. The changes of acoustic, strength properties and acoustic anizotropy have been denoted during the period of becoming old (after 40). Decrease of ultrasound velocity was mostly observed in dorsal region of cortical bone tissue and in front region of trabecular bone tissue. The decrease of acoustic anizotropy has been denoted in front part of vertebrae of cortical and trabecular bone tissue. The high level of correlation of ultrasound velocity and penetration strength of vertebrae bone tissue prove that penetration strength could be used in diagnostics of changes of the strength of vertebrae bone tissue. It was ascertained that early stages of spine <b>degeneration</b> <b>diseases</b> are characteristic with a considerable decrease - about 30 % to 50 % in comparison with healthy people - of the strength trabecular bone tissue of vertebrae. Parallely with the decrease of penetration strength of trabecular bone of vertebrae, the changes of intraosal blood circulation - increase of intraosal pressure and intraosal venous stases - were denoted. Experimental researches and clinical observations showed that changes of strength of vertebrae bone tissue and intraosal blood circulation are the main factors in pathogenesis of early stages of spinal degenerative diseases.

40|$|SUMMARY Goldmann-Favre syndrome, {{also known}} as {{enhanced}} S-cone syndrome, is an inherited retinal <b>degeneration</b> <b>disease</b> in which a gain of photoreceptor cell types results in retinal dysplasia and degeneration. Although microglia have been implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, the fundamental role of these cells in this disease is unknown. In the current study, sequential analyses suggest that microglia are recruited and appear after outer nuclear layer folding. By crossing rd 7 mice (a model for hereditary retinal degeneration owing to Nr 2 e 3 mutation) with mice carrying the macrophage Fas-induced apoptosis (Mafia) transgene, we generated double-mutant mice and studied {{the role of the}} resident retinal microglia. Microglial cells in these double-mutant mice express enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and a suicide gene that can trigger Fas-mediated apoptosis via systemic treatment with AP 20187 (FK 506 dimerizer). We demonstrated that more than 80 % of the EGFP+ cells in retinas from rd 7 /rd 7;Tg/Tg mice express Iba- 1 (a microglial marker), and resident microglia are still present in the retina because AP 20187 does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Hence, only circulating bone marrow (BM) -derived microglia are depleted. Depletion of circulating BM-derived microglia accelerates retinal degeneration in rd 7 mice. An increased number of autofluorescent (AF) spots is a consequence of resident microglia proliferation, which in turn establishes an inflammatory cytokine milieu via the upregulation of IL- 1 β, IL- 6 and TNFα expression. This inflammation is likely to accelerate retinal degeneration. This study not only identifies inflammation as a crucial step in the pathogenesis of retinal degeneration, but also highlights the involvement of specific cytokine genes that could serve as future treatment targets in retinal degenerations...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundAmyloid {{precursor}} protein knockout mice (APP-KO) have impaired differentiation of amacrine and horizontal cells. APP {{is part of}} a gene family and its paralogue amyloid precursor-like protein 2 (APLP 2) has both shared as well as distinct expression patterns to APP, including in the retina. Given the impact of APP in the retina we investigated how APLP 2 expression affected the retina using APLP 2 knockout mice (APLP 2 -KO). ResultsUsing histology, morphometric analysis with noninvasive imaging technique and electron microscopy, we showed that APLP 2 -KO retina displayed abnormal formation of the outer synaptic layer, accompanied with greatly impaired photoreceptor ribbon synapses in adults. Moreover, APLP 2 -KO displayed a significant decease in ON-bipolar, rod bipolar and type 2 OFF-cone bipolar cells (36, 21 and 63  %, respectively). Reduction of the number of bipolar cells was accompanied with disrupted dendrites, reduced expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 at the dendritic tips and alteration of axon terminals in the OFF laminae of the inner plexiform layer. In contrast, the APP-KO photoreceptor ribbon synapses and bipolar cells were intact. The APLP 2 -KO retina displayed numerous phenotypic similarities with the congenital stationary night blindness, a non-progressive retinal <b>degeneration</b> <b>disease</b> characterized by the loss of night vision. The pathological phenotypes in the APLP 2 -KO mouse correlated to altered transcription of genes involved in pre- and postsynatic structure/function, including CACNA 1 F, GRM 6, TRMP 1 and Gα 0, and a normal scotopic a-wave electroretinogram amplitude, markedly reduced scotopic electroretinogram b-wave and modestly reduced photopic cone response. This confirmed the impaired function of the photoreceptor ribbon synapses and retinal bipolar cells, as is also observed in congenital stationary night blindness. Since congenital stationary night blindness present at birth, we extended our analysis to retinal differentiation and showed impaired differentiation of different bipolar cell subtypes and an altered temporal sequence of development from OFF to ON laminae in the inner plexiform layer. This was associated with the altered expression patterns of bipolar cell generation and differentiation factors, including MATH 3, CHX 10, VSX 1 and OTX 2. ConclusionsThese findings demonstrate that APLP 2 couples retina development and synaptic genes and present the first evidence that APLP 2 expression may be linked to synaptic disease...|$|E
