But I felt he was a greenhorn, {{and it turned out}} he didn't have {{experience}} in decision-making." [...] As for McCain, Eastwood reflected, [...] "I voted for McCain, not because he was a Republican, but because he had been through war (in Vietnam) and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> understand the war in Iraq better than somebody who hadn't. I didn't agree with him on a lot of stuff." [...] On August 3, 2012, he attended a fundraiser for Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, suggesting that Romney would boost the country and [...] "restore a decent tax system... so that there's a fairness and people are not pitted against one another as [...] who's paying taxes and who isn't." [...] During a speech at the 2012 Republican National Convention, Eastwood talked to an empty chair as if President Barack Obama were sitting in it. The speech was met with a huge response by the media with both praise and criticism. Eastwood, who said he came up with the speech 5 seconds before he gave it, said that if he could do it again he would say something different. [...] "My only message was [...] I wanted people to take the idolizing factor out of every contestant out there. Just look at the work, look at the background, and then make a judgment on that. I was just trying to say that, and did it in kind of a roundabout way which took a lot more time, I suppose, than they would have liked. I'd probably say something else but I'd try to get the same message across so that people don't have to kiss up to politicians. No matter what party they're in, you should evaluate their work and make your judgments accordingly. That's {{the way to do it}} in life and every other subject, but sometimes in America we get gaga, we look at the wrong values." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Amy Lee, {{the song}} has several meanings, the first being an {{incident}} at a restaurant. During an interview from a tour stop in Tulsa she told The Boston Phoenix: [...] "I {{was inspired to}} write it when someone said something to me— I didn’t know him, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be clairvoyant. I was in a relationship and I was completely unhappy. But I was hiding it. I was being completely abused and I was trying to cover it up; I wouldn’t even admit it to myself. So then I had spoken maybe 10 or 15 words to this guy, who {{was a friend of}} a friend. We were waiting for everyone else to show up, and we went into a restaurant and got a table. And {{he looked at me and}} said, ‘Are you happy?’ And I felt my heart leap, and I was like, he totally knows what I’m thinking. And I lied, I said I was fine. Anyway, he's not really clairvoyant. But he is a sociology major." [...] Lee said in a VH1 interview: [...] "Open-mindedness. It's about waking up to all the things you've been missing for so long. One day someone said something that made my heart race for a second and I realized that for months I'd been numb, just going through the motions of life." [...] During an interview with Blender, Lee claimed that she wrote [...] "Bring Me to Life" [...] about her longtime friend, Josh Hartzler, whom she married in 2007.|$|E

60|$|The {{idea that}} he was not Sir Percival Glyde at all, that he had no more claim to the baronetcy and to Blackwater Park than the poorest {{labourer}} who worked on the estate, had never once occurred to my mind. At one time <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be Anne Catherick's father--at another time <b>I</b> had <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been Anne Catherick's husband--the offence of which he was really guilty had been, from first to last, beyond the widest reach of my imagination.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I should {{imagine that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be here tomorrow, sir. <b>I</b> rather <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> {{have been here}} today, sir. The mistake is mine, no doubt, sir.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I wasn't--to say--sure," [...] said Sam; [...] "and I couldn't {{go and get}} {{him into}} a scrape. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> tell himself, if he could ever make up the money again!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot {{make it out}} at all," [...] he concluded. [...] "At first <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be Tarzan of the Apes; but he neither speaks nor understands English, so {{that theory}} is untenable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I want {{to speak}} to ye about 'Lige. Seein' the candle shinin' through the chinks <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be still with ye. If he ain't, it looks bad. Light up, can't ye! I want to show you something." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, {{we always}} speak it when together, Rajbullub. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might,</b> some day, come out here, {{and that he}} would find it very useful; and I, too, have been looking forward to returning, for a time, to the home where I was born." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{died this}} morning and has just been cast into the sea. Before he died he spoke of you, and prayed me to help you if I could. But his words were wild and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be distraught. And indeed how can I help you?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Did you see them? I just {{happened}} to think of it. I was in here, looking round. Mr. Berkeley had this room while you were away. He left this morning. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have left something in it that I could have sent on. I've often done acts of kindness that way." ...|$|R
6000|$|The Doctor grunted. [...] "Well, as {{none of us}} may see Allahabad, Bathurst, {{you need}} not trouble {{yourself}} on that score. I wonder what has become of your friend the conjurer. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have been in to see you this afternoon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am sorry, sir, {{that you}} should take a {{compliment}} to Sir Francis Drake as an insult to yourself. I brought in this gentleman because <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> give you good information; if he dies meanwhile, the loss will be yours, or rather the queen's." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, the {{caretaker}} at the flat {{told me that}} you and Morris used to speak now and then, and I'm trying every one. I'm afraid he wasn't quite classy enough for you to have palled up with, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have let something slip perhaps." ...|$|E
60|$|Not that I loved Theodore, you understand? But he and I {{had shared}} so many {{ups and downs}} {{together}} of late that I was loath {{to think of him}} as reduced to begging his bread in the streets. Then I kept him by me, for <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> at times be useful to me in my business.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Rosamond, {{with a look}} {{of disgust}} on her pretty face, [...] "I am very glad you are not Vesalius. <b>I</b> should have <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> find some less horrible way than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My {{business}} here was principally with the Quartermaster," [...] Cap continued, {{as soon as}} he had done regarding the prisoner's pantomime. [...] "The Sergeant must be near his end, and <b>I</b> have <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> wish to say something to his successor in authority before he finally departed. It is too late, it would seem; and, as you say, Pathfinder, the Lieutenant has truly gone before." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, Grandfather Frog. I really couldn't {{tell whether}} he has a tail or not," [...] replied Peter quite truthfully. [...] "At first I thought he hadn't, and then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have. If he has, it doesn't {{seem to me that}} it is enough to call a really truly tail." ...|$|E
6000|$|Lady Wantridge however, after all, easily {{overlooked}} it. [...] "I {{only knew}} {{he was one of}} your odd Americans. That's why, when I heard yesterday here that he was up there awaiting your return, I didn't let that prevent me. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be. He certainly," [...] her ladyship laughed, [...] "IS." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I did that,” {{answered}} the senator’s son. “I {{told him that}} I wanted {{to hear from him}} at once, {{and that it would be}} money in his pocket to write or to telegraph to me. I didn’t mention your name, Dave, for <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> hear of this robbery and get suspicious.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Munt's modest, you know; and <b>I</b> suppose <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> be {{the third}} that makes company a crowd. Besides, nobody stops and talks a bit at these things. They're afraid of boring or being bored." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot admit that," [...] Deane answered. [...] "I {{told him}} that I had {{declined}} to be blackmailed by Sinclair, but that after all I would prefer to pay a reasonable sum {{of money for the}} document in question. Rowan had been on more friendly terms with Sinclair than any of us, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> induce him to listen to reason." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, what {{difference}} does it make? It's all right, anyway. But it is odd to think that if your name hadn't been Campbell, the Fraser would have gone to McLean over the heads of Stone and all the rest. Their only hope was that you would both fall below seventy. It's an absurd condition, but there it is in old Professor Fraser's will. He was rich and had no family. So he left a number of bequests to the college on ordinary conditions. <b>I</b> suppose <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> humour his whim in one. His widow is a dear old soul, and always makes a special pet of the boy who wins the Fraser. Well, here's my street. So long, Campbell." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was afraid, if I {{sent him}} off--or tried to--that {{he would tell}} about my being in the Wayfarer's Lodge that night, and they would think I had been a tramp. I could have done it, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> tell some lie about me; and they might get {{to know about the}} trial----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} up to my {{guardian}} in London," [...] said I, casually drawing some guineas {{out of my pocket}} and looking at them; [...] "and I want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in. I wish to pay for them," [...] I added--otherwise <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> only pretend to make them, [...] "with ready money." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't accept; the Mother Superior did for me, because he's the Mayor of San Francisco visiting your uncle, and she's always {{anxious to}} placate {{the powers that}} be. And <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have some {{information}} that I {{could get out of}} him. And it was better than being in the convent all day. And I thought I could stand HIM if you were here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Expect!" [...] {{his father}} blustered. [...] "I don't know what I {{expected}}. I {{might have expected}} anything of him but common honesty. The position I took at the meeting was that our only hope was {{to give him a}} chance. He made all sorts of professions of ability to meet the loss. I didn't believe him, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> partially meet it, and that nothing was to be gained by proceeding against him. You can't get blood out of a turnip, even by crushing the turnip." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{must not}} forget to notice, too, a little glitter of effect--a little, shadowy, fanciful phase of feeling--that {{came over me}} when in Luther's cell at Erfurt. The time, as I told you, was golden twilight, and little birds were twittering and {{chirping}} around the casement, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> how <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have sat there, in some golden evening, sad and dreamy, hearing the birds chirp, and wondering why he alone of all creation should be so sad. I have not a doubt he has done that very thing in this very spot.|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, but I {{think there}} was some self-blame in him, though not about that horse. <b>I</b> believe <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have checked Arthur more. And he had debts which {{he seems to have}} paid on selling out his capital. So, as I have told poor Bertha {{whenever}} she would let me, there may have been other reasons besides her stinging words.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Joh. Why not, my lord? am not I the {{mistress}} of the family? and is it not my place to see good order kept in it? <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have allured some of the she-slaves to him, and was resolved to prevent {{what might have been}} betwixt him and them; when, on the sudden, he rushed out upon me, caught me in his arms with such a fury-- ...|$|E
60|$|However, I say, {{their way}} of {{fighting}} in Holland did not relish with me at all. The prince lay {{a long time before}} a little fort called Schenkenschanz, which the Spaniard took by surprise, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have taken it much sooner. Perhaps it might be my mistake, but I fancied my hero, the King of Sweden, would have carried it sword in hand, in half the time.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] Mrs. Hasketh faltered. [...] "I didn't {{want him}} to see her just the first day, or before I saw him; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> try to. She's visiting at some friends in Providence; but she'll be back to-morrow. He can come to-morrow night, if she says so. He can come and find out. But if he was {{anything}} of a man he wouldn't want to." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Is {{he really}} dead?" [...] Maria said. [...] "Oh, Francisco, how thankful I am! He seemed so determined, that I {{began to think}} he was sure some day to succeed in {{carrying}} me off. Not that I would ever have become his wife, for I had vowed to kill myself before that came about. <b>I</b> should have <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have known that he could never have forced me to be his wife." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oah yess. I am {{his good}} friend, I tell you. He was {{behaving}} very strange when I came down after you, and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> perhaps <b>he</b> <b>might</b> have the papers. I followed {{him on his}} meditations, and to discuss ethnological points also. You see, I am verree small person here nowadays, in comparison with all his charms. By Jove, O'Hara, do you know, he is afflicted with infirmity of fits. Yess, I tell you. Cataleptic, too, if not also epileptic. I found him {{in such a state}} under a tree in articulo mortem, and he jumped up and walked into a brook and he was nearly drowned but for me. I pulled him out.' ...|$|R
60|$|I stirred him {{a little}} to see if I could get him out, and he essayed to get up, but {{was not able to}} raise himself; and <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> with myself, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> even lie there; for if he had frightened me so, he would {{certainly}} fright, any of the savages, if any of them should be so hardy as to come in there, while he had any life in him.|$|R
