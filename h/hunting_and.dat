5|$|Bliege Bird et al. {{observed}} turtle <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> spear fishing {{patterns in}} a Meriam {{community in the}} Torres Strait of Australia, publishing their findings in 2001. Here, only some Meriam men were able to accumulate high caloric gains {{for the amount of}} time spent turtle hunting or spear fishing (reaching a threshold measured in kcal/h). Since a daily catch of fish is carried home by hand and turtles are frequently served at large feasts, members of the community know which men most reliably brought them turtle meat and fish. Thus, turtle hunting qualifies as a costly signal. Furthermore, turtle <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> spear fishing are actually less productive (in kcal/h) than foraging for shellfish, where success depends only on the amount of time dedicated to searching, so shellfish foraging is a poor signal of skill or strength. This suggests that energetic gains are not the primary reason men take part in turtle <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> spear fishing. A follow-up study found that successful Meriam hunters do experience greater social benefits and reproductive success than less skilled hunters.|$|E

5|$|The Menominee Indian Tribe {{had entered}} {{into a series of}} {{treaties}} with the United States that did not specifically state that they had <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> fishing rights. In 1961, Congress terminated the tribe's federal recognition, ending its right to govern itself, federal support of health care and education programs, police and fire protection, and tribal rights to land. In 1963, three members of the tribe were charged with violating Wisconsin's <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> fishing laws on land which had been a reservation for over 100 years. The tribe members were acquitted, but when the state appealed, the Wisconsin Supreme Court held that the Menominee tribe no longer had <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> fishing rights because of the termination action by Congress.|$|E
5|$|The tribe {{sued the}} United States for {{compensation}} in the US Court of Claims, which ruled that tribal members still had <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> fishing rights and that Congress had not abrogated the rights.

In 1968, the Supreme Court held that the tribe retained its <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> fishing rights under the treaties involved and the rights were not lost after federal recognition was ended by the Menominee Indian Termination Act without a clear and unequivocal statement by Congress removing the rights.|$|E
5|$|The tribe was {{represented}} by Charles A. Hobbs of Washington, D.C.

In {{the event that the}} court would decide that the <b>hunting</b> <b>and</b> fishing rights were extinguished, then the tribe should receive compensation for the loss of the rights.|$|E
