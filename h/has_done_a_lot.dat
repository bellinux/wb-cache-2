500|$|The game's level design {{received}} mixed reviews. Joynt preferred fast {{levels and}} felt that the ones requiring players to [...] "move carefully" [...] detracted from the experience. Bettenhausen praised the visual appeal of Secret Rings and compared it to that of Resident Evil 4, a game which critics acclaimed for its visuals. Casamassina agreed that the [...] "Sonic Team <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> with [...] ", and praised the varying missions and levels' aesthetic contrast. However, he criticized the placement of obstacles. Fahey denounced levels' [...] "avoidable blind spots and leaps of faith", and found the number of stages and their re-use over multiple missions [...] "a little bit disconcerting". He conceded that it added to the game's replay value, comparing the levels to tracks in racing games.|$|E

2500|$|Phat Boy e.t.c <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> {{to promote}} Botswana hip hop. The hip hop {{movement}} in Botswana has grown {{over the years}} as evidenced by the release over the years of albums and songs from artists such as Mr Doe, Zeus, Touch Motswak Tswak, Ignition, S.C.A.R, Awesomore.aka Gaddamit, Cashless Society, Nitro, Konkrete, HT, Flex, Dice, Dj Dagizus, 3rd Mind, Kast, Nomadic, and Draztik to name a few. The release of hip hop albums is slow because of the small market and competition from other genres of mostly dance-oriented music. Since 2000 hip hop has achieved more prominence in Botswana, with rappers like Scar Kast and Third Mind releasing relatively successful albums. In 2006, Scar released his sophomore offering, [...] "Happy Hour". The same year Kast released [...] "Dazzit". S.C.A.R has since won a Channel O Spirit of Africa Award 2007 for best hip hop.|$|E
2500|$|Sanregret {{continued}} the search after Pearson {{turned down the}} job, but she met with Pearson again in early May at the American Hockey Coaches Association convention in Naples, Florida, {{and this time he}} was ready to accept. Pearson signed a five-year contract and was introduced at the Grant Hockey Educational Center on Michigan Tech's campus on May10. At the press conference, Pearson posited that what separates him from the previous alumni who have returned to coach the Huskies is his 30years of experience. [...] "As you're in the game longer you get a bigger network of people who can help you recruit, so I think that's the biggest difference right now", Pearson said. Bill Muckalt, a veteran of five National Hockey League (NHL) seasons who was coached by Pearson at Michigan, was hired as an assistant coach in June; Damon Whitten was retained as the other assistant coach. [...] "Our coaching staff <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> of winning and we want to instill the attitude that we're going to win", Whitten said. Pearson spoke of changing the team's style of play to emphasize skill, speed and offensive creativity, and said his staff's efforts would be focused on recruiting for the next few months. He brought in Steve Shields, another former NHL player who played under Pearson at Michigan, as a volunteer goaltending coach in September.|$|E
