40|$|This book {{introduces}} the topics most relevant to autonomously flying <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> robots: flapping-wing design, aerodynamics, and artificial intelligence. Readers can explore these topics {{in the context}} of the "Delfly", a <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> robot designed at Delft University in The Netherlands. How are tiny fruit flies able to lift their weight, avoid obstacles and predators, and find food or shelter? The first step in emulating this is the creation of a micro <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> robot that flies by itself. The challenges are considerable: the design and aerodynamics of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> are still active areas of scientific research, whilst artificial intelligence is subject to extreme limitations deriving from the few sensors and minimal processing onboard. This book conveys the essential insights that lie behind success such as the DelFly Micro and the DelFly Explorer. The DelFly Micro, with its 3. 07 grams and 10 cm wing span, is still the smallest <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> MAV in the world carrying a camera, whilst the DelFly Explorer is the world's first <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> MAV that is able to fly completely autonomously in unknown environments. The DelFly project started in 2005 and ever since has served as inspiration, not only to many scientific <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> studies, but also the design of <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> toys.

40|$|<b>Flapping</b> <b>wing</b> {{propulsion}} has {{the potential}} to revolutionise the field of Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs), but {{little is known about the}} effect of flapping motion on the performance of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> Prototype MAVs have achieved flight with passive <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> moving in a sinusoidal flapping motion, but the possible benefits of alternative flapping motions have not been studied in detail. This thesis presents the development of an Integrated Testing System (ITS), which allows the evaluation of <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> performance for different flapping motions. A detailed parametric study of the effect of <b>flapping</b> motion on <b>wing</b> performance is performed, and the optimal flapping motion for several passive <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> is determined by hardware-in-the-loop optimisation of two wing performance metrics. The developed ITS was able to automatically test a variety of passive <b>flapping</b> <b>wings,</b> and demonstrated precise control of the flapping motion and accurate and repeatable measurements of average lift force, mechanical power, and wing twist angle. The parametric study revealed that of the three flapping motions tested, the sinusoidal flapping motion generated the highest lift force, but a smoothed triangular motion was able to generate lift significantly more efficiently under load. The optimal flapping motion was successfully determined for three <b>flapping</b> <b>wings,</b> and was found to increase the loaded efficiency of the wings by an average of 31 % over a sinusoidal flapping motion. The determined optimal motion was almost identical for the three tested wings, and was found to strongly resemble the flapping motion of insects These findings demonstrate that significant improvements in the performance of passive <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> can be achieved by relatively minor variations of the flapping motion.

40|$|Micro Air Vehicles (MAVs) {{are defined}} as a class of {{vehicles}} with their larger dimension not exceeding 15 cm and weighing 100 gm. The three main approaches for providing lift for such vehicles are through fixed, rotating and <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> The <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> MAVs are more efficient in the low Reynolds-number regime than conventional wings and rotors. Natural flapping ﬂyers, such as birds and insects, serve as a natural source of inspiration {{for the development of}} MAV. <b>Flapping</b> <b>wing</b> design {{is one of the major}} challenges to develop an MAV because it is not only responsible for the lift, but also propulsion and maneuvers. Two important issues are addressed in this thesis: (1) an equivalent beam-type modeling of actual insect wing is proposed based on the experimental data and (2) development of the numerical framework for design and analysis of insect scale smart <b>flapping</b> <b>wing.</b> The experimental data is used for structural modeling of the blowfly Calliphora wing as a stepped cantilever beam with nine spanwise sections of varying mass per unit lengths, flexural rigidity (EI) and torsional rigidity (GJ) values. Natural frequencies, both in bending and torsion, are obtained by solving the homogeneous part of the respective governing differential equations using the finite element method. It is found that natural frequency in bending and torsion are 3. 17 and 1. 57 times higher than flapping frequency of Calliphora wing, respectively. The results provide guidelines for the biomimetic structural design of insect-scale <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> In addition to the structural modeling of the insect wing, development of the biomimetic mechanisms played a very important role to achieve a deeper insight of the flapping ﬂight. Current biomimetic <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> mechanisms are either dynamically scaled or rely on pneumatic and motor-driven flapping actuators. Unfortunately, these mechanisms become bulky and flap at very low frequency. Moreover, mechanisms designed with conventional actuators lead to high weight and system-complexity which makes it difficult to mimic the complex wingbeat kinematics of the natural flyers. The usage of the actuator made of smart materials such as ionic polymer metal composites (IPMCs) and piezoceramics to design <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> is a potential alternative. IPMCs are a relatively new type of smart material that belongs to the family of Electroactive Polymers (EAP) which is also known as “artificial muscles”. In this work, structural modeling and aerodynamic analysis of a dragonﬂy inspired IPMC <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> are performed using numerical simulations. An optimization study is performed to obtain improved flapping actuation of the IPMC wing. Later, a comparative study of the performances of three IPMC <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> having the same size as the actual wings of three different dragonﬂy species Aeshna Multicolor, Anax Parthenope Julius and Sympetrum Frequens is conducted. It is found that the IPMC wing generates sufficient lift to support its own weight and carry a small payload. In addition to the IPMC, piezoelectric materials are also considered to design a dragonfly inspired <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> because they have several attractive features such as high bandwidth, high output force, compact size and high power density. The wings of birds and insects move through a large angle which may be obtained using piezofan through large deflection. Piezofan which is one of the simple motion amplifying mechanisms couples a piezoelectric unimorph to an attached flexible wing and is competent to produce large deflection especially at resonance. Non-linear dynamic model for the piezoelectrically actuated <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> is done using energy method. It is shown that flapping angle variations of the smart <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> are similar to the actual dragonfly wing for a specific feasible voltage. Subsequently, a comparative study of the performances of three piezoelectrically actuated <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> is performed. Numerical results show that the <b>ﬂapping</b> <b>wing</b> based on geometry of dragonfly Sympetrum Frequens wing is suitable for low speed flight and it represents a potential candidate for use in insect scale micro air vehicles. In this study, single crystal piezoceramic is also considered for the <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> design because they are the potential new generation materials and have attracted considerable attention due to superior electromechanical properties. It is found that the use of single crystal piezoceramic can lead to considerable amount of wing weight reduction and increase of aerodynamic forces compared to conventional piezoelectric materials such as PZT- 5 H. It can also be noted that natural fliers <b>flap</b> their <b>wings</b> in a vertical plane with a change in the pitch of the <b>wings</b> during a <b>ﬂapping</b> cycle. In order to capture this particular feature of the wingbeat kinematics, coupled flapping-twisting non-linear dynamic modeling of piezoelectrically actuated <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> is done using energy method. Excitation by the piezoelectric harmonic force generates only the flap bending motion, which in turn, induces the elastic twist motion due to interaction between flexural and torsional vibrations modes.

Based on a new modelling approach, the effects of flapping on the induced drag in <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> vehicles are mathematically described. It is shown that flapping causes {{a significant increase in}} the induced drag when compared with a non-flapping, fixed wing vehicle. There are two effects for that induced drag increase; one is due to tilting of the lift vector caused by <b>flapping</b> the <b>wings</b> and the other results from changes in the amount of the lift vector during flapping.

40|$|Quasi-steady {{aerodynamic}} models play {{an important}} role in evaluating aerodynamic performance and conducting design and optimization of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> The kinematics of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> is generally a resultant motion of wing translation (yaw) and rotation (pitch and roll). Most quasi-steady models are aimed at predicting the lift and thrust generation of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> with prescribed kinematics. Nevertheless, it is insufficient to limit <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> to prescribed kinematics only since passive pitching motion is widely observed in natural flapping flights and preferred for the <b>wing</b> design of <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> micro air vehicles (FWMAVs). In addition to the aerodynamic forces, an accurate estimation of the aerodynamic torque about the pitching axis is required to study the passive pitching motion of flapping flights. The unsteadiness arising from the wing’s rotation complicates the estimation of the centre of pressure (CP) and the aerodynamic torque within the context of quasi-steady analysis. Although there are a few attempts in literature to model the torque analytically, the involved problems are still not completely solved. In this work, we present an analytical quasi-steady model by including four aerodynamic loading terms. The loads result from the wings translation, rotation, their coupling as well as the added-mass effect. The necessity of including all the four terms in a quasi-steady model in order to predict both the aerodynamic force and torque is demonstrated. Validations indicate a good accuracy of predicting the CP, the aerodynamic loads and the passive pitching motion for various Reynolds numbers. Moreover, compared to the existing quasi-steady models, the presented model does not rely on any empirical parameters and thus is more predictive, which enables application to the shape and kinematics optimization of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> Accepted Author ManuscriptStructural Optimization and Mechanic...|$|R

Engineering studies have confirmed that deformations can increase the lift of <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> Wing flexi-bility has been studied through experimental construction-and-evaluation meth-ods and through computational numerical models. Between experimental and numerical methods {{there is a need}} for a simple method to model and evaluate the structural dynamics of flexible <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> This dissertation’s {{analytical model}} addresses this need. A time-periodic assumed-modes beam analysis of a <b>flapping,</b> flexible <b>wing</b> undergoing linear deformations is developed from a beam analysis of a helicopter blade. The resultant structural model includes bending and torsion degrees of freedom. The model is non-dimensionalized. The ratio of the system’s structural natural frequency to wingbeat frequency characterizes its constant stiffness, an...|$|R
40|$|Inspired by {{the high}} {{performance}} of rotary and insect <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> capable of {{vertical take-off and landing}} and hovering (VTOLH), a novel <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> rotor (FWR) has been developed by combining the above two types of wing motions. The FWR offers an alternative configuration for micro air vehicles (MAV) of such high flight performance. Unlike the well-studied aerodynamics of rotary and insect-like <b>flapping</b> <b>wing</b> with prescribed wing motion, the aerodynamic lift and efficiency of the FWR associated with optimal kinematics of motion has not been studied in a systematic manner before. This investigation is therefore focused on the FWR optimal kinematic motion in terms of aerodynamic lift and efficiency. Aerodynamic analysis is conducted for a FWR model of aspect ratio 3. 6 and wing span 200 mm in a range of kinematic parameters. The analysis is based on a quasi-steady aerodynamic model with empirical coefficients and validated by CFD results at Re∼ 3500. For comparison purpose, the analysis includes rotary and insect-like <b>flapping</b> <b>wings</b> in hovering status with the FWR at an equilibrium rotation speed when the thrust equals to drag. The results show that the rotary wing has the greatest power efficiency but the smallest lift coefficient. Whereas the FWR can produce the greatest aerodynamic lift with power efficiency between rotary and insect-like <b>flapping</b> <b>wings.</b> The results provide a quantified guidance for design option of the three types of high performance MAVs together with the optimal kinematics of motion according to flight performance requirement...|$|R
