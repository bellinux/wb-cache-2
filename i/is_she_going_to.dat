500|$|In an {{interview}} with Digital Spy, Gray said of her character's persona: I never {{wanted her to be}} boring. She was never boring before–she started out kind of boring, but I think that's the kiss of death because people will expect her to be interesting. By interesting, that doesn't mean she's drunk. I had {{to do a lot of}} thinking about what we would do with her. Where would she be now? I did a lot of homework finding out where she would be and what Texas women are like now. What has she gone through in her life? What has she come to grips with? What does she like about herself? What doesn't she like about herself? What kind of impact <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> make on her life, on John Ross's life, on her future? Who is she? ...|$|E
500|$|The episode flashbacks to the {{previous}} developments of several storylines throughout the season, including the love triangle between Rick, Shane, and Lori. Mazzara iterated that upon hearing of her husband's revelations, Lori was conflicted with several issues. [...] "All of that is going through Lori's mind. Rick murdered Shane and she did confess she had feelings for Shane. Her son {{was a part of}} it. They're all infected. Is her baby infected? We're out on the road, where <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> give birth? What happens if the baby dies? What happens if she dies? All of these questions are going through her head. The thing that affects her most is that she played a role in Shane's death. She put those two men at odds, she whispered in Rick's ear and then she talked to Shane at the windmill. She realizes that this has been over her, and in a sense she has been an active participant in Shane's death. So she can blame Rick for that, but she's horrified by her own culpability." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2004, Nich Maragos and David Smith of 1UP.com ranked Ibuki as {{the sixth}} overall best ninja {{character}} in video games, calling her [...] "{{one of the}} coolest-looking characters" [...] in Street Fighter III but [...] "also {{one of the least}} capable in competition." [...] That same year, Aubrey Sitterson of UGO featured her on a list of the 25 [...] "foxiest fighting females to ever be pixelated" [...] and commented that Ibuki is [...] "not only super-hot, but she's also a ninja, which is like a 'chocolate in my peanut butter' situation." [...] UGO's Paul Furfari further stated that she [...] "set the new standard in female fighters," [...] adding, [...] "forget Chun-Li". GameZone included the [...] "amazing" [...] Ibuki in their 2011 list of [...] "best video game ninjas" [...] and stated: [...] "We’re glad she’s still a staple in this series to this very day – but when <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come over to Marvel vs. Capcom territory?" [...] Márcio Pacheco Alexsandro of Brazil's Game Hall placed her at tenth spot of his 2014 list of top kunoichi characters in games, opining that she is [...] "far from having such status as Chun-Li, but has her charm, especially if you like Japanese schoolgirls." [...] Joe Pring from WhatCulture.com placed Ibuki at 19th spot on his 2015 list of the greatest female fighting game characters of all time: [...] "Ninja's are always cool, but Ibuki takes that awesome factor to a whole new level." [...] In 2016, Steven Hanson from Destructoid described her as [...] "everybody's favorite schoolgirl ninja." [...] A poll for the most erotic girl in the history of fighting games conducted by Japanese web portal Goo had Ibuki and Ayane, a schoolgirl female ninja from Dead or Alive, share the 11th/12th place (out of 50 contesters) in 2016.|$|E
60|$|Where <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to?</b> <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> a {{place called}} Roxham; here it was written on the ticket. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be {{companion}} to a dear young lady, very rich, like all the English, whom she had met when she had travelled with her French family to Jersey, a Miss Lee.|$|R
6000|$|Not {{a muscle}} of the man's frame moved, and yet his large heart beat fast in his deep chest. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell him? Was {{irremediable}} mischief done? ...|$|R
6000|$|Gyp, who {{was sitting}} at her bureau, seemed to be adding up the counterfoils in her cheque-book. She did not turn round, and Fiorsen paused. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> receive him? ...|$|R
6000|$|ROBERTS: [...] "Very {{singular}} her not coming! <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> begin standing upon ceremony with us, and {{not come}} till the hour?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And Amy, what <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] asked Mrs. March, well {{pleased at}} Laurie's {{decision}} {{and the energy}} with which he spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so {{very glad}} to hear it," [...] said Vogelstein, who decidedly, for his career, had promise. [...] "And <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> marry him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, that {{is where}} we are going; at least, Constance <b>is.</b> <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> work at her {{painting}} while I pay a round of visits. Wont you come with us?" ...|$|R
60|$|Ursula's heart sank. Everybody {{seemed so}} cocksure and so bossy. How <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{get on with}} such jolty, jerky, bossy people? And Miss Harby had not spoken a word to {{the man at the}} table. She simply ignored him. Ursula felt the callous crude rudeness between the two teachers.|$|R
6000|$|With {{these words}} {{she lifted her}} eyes and looked him {{straight}} in the face. There seemed a certain pride and nobility in her {{he had not seen}} before, though her beautiful brown eyes were troubled, and there was a mark of pain on her brow. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> tell him? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She? Ought she not {{to think}} herself only too much honoured by marrying a son of Odin? <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be more dainty than Placidia?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{how about}} getting married, {{and the girl}} you are engaged to, and whom you are looking forward so much to seeing. <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take to farming?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Heaven above! Why {{did you not}} deep those cursed sugar-tongs out of [...] her sight? How <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{get through}} it if you frighten her [...] like this? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know that; but <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> break down. <b>She</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{drag out}} the engagement, {{in the hope}} of making me relent." ...|$|R
5000|$|The song {{is about}} the {{phenomenon}} of groupies, and takes a dismissive attitude toward them ("Think I'll let her keep on <b>going,</b> wherever it <b>is</b> <b>she's</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> / Give her an autograph and tell her 'It's been nice knowing you'"... "It won't take much time / Before I get her off my mind").|$|R
60|$|I {{deposited}} {{our young}} {{friend on the}} floor. She took her doll, and {{stood for a moment}} deep in thought. What <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do next? We were not kept long in suspense. She suddenly put her little hot fat hand into mine, and tried to pull me after her out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{told me you}} {{had been}} very kind in helping her. I daresay I should have heard more, if I had not fallen asleep. What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|KNOX. Who {{wants to}} turn her out? But <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> ruin us? To let {{everybody}} know of her disgrace and shame? To tear me down from the position Ive made for myself and you by forty years hard struggling? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Has {{she come}} to sit upon Quilp's knee,' said the dwarf, {{in what he}} {{meant to be a}} {{soothing}} tone, 'or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed in her own little room inside here? Which is poor Nelly going to do?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No {{particular}} reason! Why, the Antelope is a privateer; and if <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> cruise about, {{that means}} that <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fight, and he may get shot." ...|$|R
60|$|But <b>was</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> fulfill her {{deliberate}} intention? <b>She</b> {{began to}} <b>be</b> afraid of herself, {{and to find}} out a certain difficulty in doing as she liked. Already her assertion of independence in evading his advances had been carried farther than <b>was</b> necessary, and <b>she</b> <b>was</b> thinking with some anxiety what she might do on the next occasion.|$|R
6000|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> {{certain that}} <b>she</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive <b>to</b> Seattle. <b>She</b> wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> drive anywhere! <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> freight the car back to Minneapolis, and herself go back by train--Pullman!--drawing-room! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You'd {{like her}} to protect you, would you?" [...] Graveling taunted. [...] "Listen here. I'm {{not the sort of}} man to have my girl taken away and made another man's plaything. <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop here? Answer me quickly." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've said nothing. Don't like house-cleaning {{well enough}} to suggest it. I did think the hall was rather dirty when I dropped my coat and took it up covered with lint. <b>Is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> upset the whole place?" [...] asked Mr. Bemis, looking alarmed at the prospect.|$|E
6000|$|... "We want to {{know how}} she feels about to-night; what report she makes of her nerves, her anticipations; how she looked, what she had on, up to six o'clock. Gracious! if I could see her I should know what I wanted, and so would she, I guess!" [...] Mr. Pardon exclaimed. [...] "You must know something, Mrs. Luna; it isn't natural you shouldn't. I won't inquire any further where she is, because that might seem a little pushing, if she does wish to {{withdraw}} herself--though I am bound to say I think she makes a mistake; we could work up these last hours for her! But can't you tell me any little personal items--the sort of thing the people like? What <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have for supper? or <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> speak--a--without previous nourishment?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> faint; <b>she</b> {{would make}} herself bear up. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do {{something}} to get Moses out of this snare,--but what? At last they rose.|$|R
6000|$|... "If <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stay in Paris--yes!" [...] he said. [...] "If <b>she</b> <b>is</b> really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> Brazil, {{it matters}} little what she does. A Parisian, of course, would never bring his womankind here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'But {{you will}} see poor Berta? She has done no harm. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> write long letters {{to all of you}} to-day, {{explaining}} her wedding, and how <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help us all on in the world.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Locker {{took his}} hands from his pockets, and folded his arms. [...] "Yes, I do," [...] he said; [...] "I feel as {{thoroughly}} disheartened as I do now. But I have one comfort; Keats and Miss Asher dropped me; I did not drop them. So {{there is nothing}} on my conscience. And now tell me, <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take Lancaster? I hope so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you think, 'That weak girl--how <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> get a man {{to marry}} her when she chooses?' But {{let me tell you}} one thing, aunt: Mr. Wildeve is not a profligate man, any more than I am an {{improper}} woman. He has an unfortunate manner, and doesn't try to make people like him if they don't wish to do it of their own accord." ...|$|E
6000|$|Peter hopped {{a couple}} of steps nearer. [...] "Say, Johnny," [...] he whispered, [...] "how <b>is</b> <b>she</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> know whether you stay in the yard all the time or not, so long as you are here when she gets home? I know where there's the dandiest sweet-clover patch. We can go over there and back easy before old Mrs. Chuck gets home, and she won't know {{anything}} about it. Come on!" ...|$|E
60|$|ANN. I {{have seen}} her, Jack. And I {{am sorry to}} say I <b>am</b> afraid <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be rather obstinate about going abroad. I think Tavy ought {{to speak to her}} about it.|$|R
60|$|Simply {{absurd to}} wait. She poured her own cup of tea. She sat {{and stared at}} it. What <b>was</b> it <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do now? Oh yes; how idiotic; take a lump of sugar.|$|R
60|$|<b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{change her}} job again--for {{the last time}} <b>she</b> hoped. <b>She</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be a creator, a real manager, unhampered by Mr. Truax's unwillingness to accept women as {{independent}} workers and by the growing animosity of Mrs. Truax.|$|R
