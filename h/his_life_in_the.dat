5|$|Bloody Fun Days {{theme was}} {{inspired}} by the short story Everything Can Be Beaten by Jhonen Vasquez. The story centres on a monster called It, who spends <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> confines of a single room, waiting in front of a chute that kittens slide down. He crushes the kittens with a hammer. One day It decides to leave the room, and encounters a world full of 'cute' animals.

Henry Mackarness. In 1872 he published his autobiography, a two-volume work entitled The Recollections and Reflections of J.R.

5|$|Although most of Wodehouse's {{fiction is}} set in England, {{he spent much of}} <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US and used New York and Hollywood as {{settings}} for some of his novels and short stories. During and after the First World War, together with Guy Bolton and Jerome Kern, he wrote a series of Broadway musical comedies that were {{an important part of the}} development of the American musical. He began the 1930s writing for MGM in Hollywood. In a 1931 interview, his naïve revelations of incompetence and extravagance in the studios caused a furore. In the same decade, his literary career reached a new peak.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} pilot, Miller {{structured}} each episode by telling two {{stories in the}} episode. The first was a traditional procedural plotline. The second story was a flashback from Henry's past. The flashback either related to the episode's main present-day storyline, such as Henry's involvement in investigating the Jack the Ripper case, or was a scene from Henry's backstory, such as <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lower East Side's tenements in the 1890s. Both the father-son relationship between Henry and Abe {{and one of the}} two season-long story arcs, Henry's relationship with his wife Abigail, were told through flashbacks.|$|E

5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism and conspicuous intrepidity {{above and}} {{beyond the call of duty}} during action against enemy Japanese forces off Savo Island on the night of 12–13 November 1942. Although out-balanced in strength and numbers by a desperate and determined enemy, Rear Admiral Callaghan, with ingenious tactical skill and superb coordination of the units under his command, led his forces into battle against tremendous odds, thereby contributing decisively to the rout of a powerful invasion fleet and to the consequent frustration of a formidable Japanese offensive. While faithfully directing close-range operations in the face of furious bombardment by superior enemy fire power, he was killed on the bridge of his Flagship. His courageous initiative, inspiring leadership, and judicious foresight in a crisis of grave responsibility were in keeping with the finest traditions of the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> defense of his country.|$|E
5|$|Gunn {{feels the}} peak of his playing career was making what he calls the save of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UEFA Cup match against Bayern Munich in 1993.

5|$|In August 1835, Jefferson and Sarah {{traveled}} {{south to}} his sister Anna's home in West Feliciana Parish, Louisiana; the plantation was known as Locust Grove. Their goal was to spend the hot summer months in the countryside away from the river floodplain, for their health, but both of them contracted either malaria or yellow fever. Sarah {{died at the age}} of 21 on September 15, 1835, after just three months of marriage. Davis was also severely ill, and his family feared for <b>his</b> <b>life.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> month following Sarah's death, he slowly improved, although he remained weak.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 16th-century French Wars of Religion, Paris was a Catholic League stronghold, the organisers of the 24 August 1572 St. Bartholomew's Day {{massacre}} that killed thousands of French Protestants. The conflicts ended when crown-pretendant Henry IV, after converting to Catholicism to gain {{entry to the}} capital, entered the city in 1594 to claim the crown of France. This king made several improvements to the capital during his reign: he completed the construction of Paris' first uncovered, sidewalk-doted bridge, the Pont Neuf, built a Louvre extension that connected it the Tuileries Palace, and created the first Paris residential square, the Place Royale, now Place des Vosges. The king would end <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> capital, assassinated in a narrow street by Les Halles marketplace in 1610.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of Æthelberht's life or reign, as very few East Anglian records have survived from this period. Mediaeval chroniclers have {{provided}} dubious accounts of <b>his</b> <b>life,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> absence of any real details. According to Richard of Cirencester, writing in the fifteenth century, Æthelberht's parents were Æthelred I of East Anglia and Leofrana of Mercia. Richard narrates in detail a story of Æthelberht's piety, election as king and wise rule. Urged to marry against his will, he apparently agreed to wed Eadburh, the daughter of Offa of Mercia, {{and set out to}} visit her, despite his mother's forebodings and his experiences of terrifying events (an earthquake, a solar eclipse and a vision).|$|E

Over the course of seven seasons—beginning on the day Clark rescues him from drowning—Lex tries to uncover the secrets that Clark keeps.

At {{the end of the war}} he returned to the US and continued his film work, but increasingly appeared on American radio and television channels, and later on their British counterparts. In the latter medium he appeared frequently in the Four Star Playhouse series, as well as producing some editions. For his roles in both television and on film, Niven was honoured with two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. He died in 1983 from a virulent form of motor neurone disease at the age of 73.|$|E
5|$|The Gaelic poet Alasdair mac Mhaighstir Alasdair {{spent much}} of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hebrides and made {{frequent}} references to them in his poetry, including in An Airce and Birlinn Chlann Raghnaill. The best known Gaelic poet of her era, Màiri Mhòr nan Òran (Mary MacPherson, 1821–98), embodied {{the spirit of the}} land agitation of the 1870s and 1880s. This, and her powerful evocation of the Hebrides—she was from Skye—has made her among the most enduring Gaelic poets. Allan MacDonald (1859–1905), who spent his adult life on Eriskay and South Uist, composed hymns and verse in honour of the Blessed Virgin, the Christ Child, and the Eucharist. In his secular poetry, MacDonald praised the beauty of Eriskay and its people. In his verse drama, Parlamaid nan Cailleach (The Old Wives' Parliament), he lampooned the gossiping of his female parishioners and local marriage customs.|$|E
5|$|After resigning {{from the}} AHC, Darwaza {{spent the rest}} of <b>his</b> <b>life</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> modern state of Syria where he left {{politics}} to concentrate on literature. Although he did much of his writing in the 1930s and 1940s, he did not have any of his works published until the 1960s. As a pan-Arab intellectual, Darwaza aided in establishing the union between Syria and Egypt forming the short-lived United Arab Republic. After Egypt adopted its 1956 constitution declaring that it was an Arab country and its people a part of the Arab nation, Darwaza concluded that Egypt and Syria were in a position to unite. When unity negotiations underwent, he suggested several forms of federation, such as the American, Soviet, and Indian models, but did not recommend any specific model for an Arab state. Darwaza did, however, suggest that the institution of a federation between Egypt and Syria would be the first step towards the realization of a comprehensive union.|$|E
