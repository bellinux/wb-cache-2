40|$|A {{high-frequency}} equivalent-circuit {{model of}} a GaAs dual-gate FET and analytical expressions for the input/output impedances, transconductance, unilateral gain, and stability factor are presented. It is found that the gain of a dual-gate FET is higher than of a single-gate FET at low frequency but decreases faster as frequency increases because of the capacitive shunting effect of the second gate. A dual-gate power FET suitable for variable-gain-amplifier applications up to K-band has been developed. At 10 GHz, a 1. 2 -mm-gatewidth device has achieved an output power of 1. 1 W with 10. 5 -dB gain and 31 -percent power-added efficiency. At 20 GHz, the same device delivered an output power of 340 mW with 5. 3 -dB gain.

An experimental campaign was held during the summer of 2004 at the “Re-newable Energies Outdoor Laboratory ” of the Polytechnic University of Marche (Ancona, It-aly), where three experimental boxes were built: two of them were built with the south-facing walls containing PCM characterized by different stratifications, whereas the third box was built using a light multi-layered south facing wall without the insertion of PCM (hereon referred to as “reference box”). The use of the PCM pro-vided three main positive results when com-pared to the reference box:- lowering of the radiant surface wall tempera-tures, even if not provided with a thick insu-lation layer;- strong reduction of incoming heat flux {{in the presence of a}} PCM layer, whose peaks are halved compared to the reference wall;- shift in time of the highest incoming heat flux value occurrence which, for south-facing PCM containing walls, moves to a number of hours later than the reference box’s wall. 1...|$|R

The two main advantages deriving from the <b>insertion</b> of <b>Phase</b> <b>Change</b> Materials (PCM) inside the external envelopes of buildings are lowering temperature peaks in internal environments and shifting their occurrence in time. In this contribution the data collected from a three-month experimental campaign are elaborated through a time series model with conditional heteroskedasticity, {{for the evaluation of}} the positive effects deriving from the insertion of a PCM layer in standard stratifications of dry assembled lightweight walls. In this work the performances of two different PCM containing stratifications are compared with the ones of a standard dry assembled lightweight wall. The statistical model in this paper is able of interpreting the long memory effects that affect the temperature time series of the experimental walls, even if {{with the use of a}} small number of parameters.

40|$|Energy {{harvesting}} {{devices have}} demonstrated {{their ability to}} provide power autonomy to wireless sensor networks. However, the adoption of such powering solutions by the industry is challenging due to their reliance on very specific environmental conditions such as vibration at a specific frequency, direct sunlight, or a local temperature difference. Dynamic thermoelectric harvesting {{has been shown to}} expand the applicability of thermoelectric generators by creating a local spatial temperature gradient from a temporal temperature fluctuation. Here, a simple method for prototyping or short-run production of such devices is introduced. It is based on the design and 3 -D printing of an insulating container, <b>insertion</b> of a <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> material in encapsulated form, and use of commercial thermoelectric generators. The simplicity of this dry assembly method is demonstrated. Two prototype devices with double-wall insulation structures are fabricated, using a stainless-steel and a plastic <b>phase</b> <b>change</b> material encapsulation and a commercial TEG. Performance tests under a temperature cycle between ± 25 °C show energy output of 43. 6 and 32. 1 J from total device masses of 69 and 50 g, respectively. Tests under multiple temperature cycles demonstrate the reliability and performance repeatability of such devices. The proposed method addresses the complication of requiring a wet stage during the final assembly of dynamic thermoelectric harvesters. It allows design and customization to particular size, energy, and insulation geometry requirements. This is important because it makes dynamic harvesting prototyping widely available and easy to reproduce, test, and integrate into systems with various energy requirements and size restrictions...|$|R

40|$|A {{concept for}} {{a solar power}} {{satellite}} antenna power combiner which utilizes solid state dc-rf converters is described. To avoid the power combining losses associated with circuit hybrids it is proposed that the power from multiple solid state amplifiers be combined by direct coupling of each amplifier's output to the radiating antenna structure. The selected power-combining antenna consists of a printed (metalized) microstrip circuit on a ceramic type dielectric substrate which is backed by a shallow lightweight aluminum cavity which sums the power of four microwave sources. The antenna behaves like two one-half wavelength slot-line antennas coupled together via their common cavity structure. A significant feature of the antenna configuration selected is that the radiated energy is summed to yield a single radiated output phase which represents the average <b>insertion</b> <b>phase</b> of the four power amplifiers. This energy may be sampled and, by comparison with the input signal, one can phase error correct to maintain the <b>insertion</b> <b>phase</b> of all solid state power combining modules {{at exactly the same}} value.

The <b>insertion</b> of a <b>Phase</b> <b>Change</b> Material coupled with a thermotropic layer is herewith proposed as an innovative solution aimed at improving the energy performance of the fenestration. The intention {{is to increase the}} dynamic features of glazing systems and to enhance their capability of exploiting solar energy – a crucial feature in nearly Zero Energy Buildings. The paper presents the experimental analysis of two prototypes of such a glazing concept and the assessment of their energy performance during the warm season. The samples are installed on an outdoor thermostatic cell facing south, together with a reference triple glazed unit, and continuous measurements of temperatures, irradiances and heat fluxes are performed. In the summer season, when the aim of the glazing system is to reduce the solar gain and to allow daylighting the energy performance is very promising. When compared to the reference technology, both the prototypes are able to reduce to a great extend the direct transmitted solar energy, as well as to smooth the peak indoor surface temperature of the glazing. In particular, one of the two configurations lowers down the solar energy gain under all boundary conditions, while the other configuration presents a slightly worse performance than the other prototype when high solar irradiation occurs. An attempt to measure the thermal transmittance was also carried out and it is shown that the insertion of PCM does not increase the U-value of the component...|$|R
