40|$|Abstract: Full mould {{casting process}} uses {{polystyrene}} foam as the pattern. The pattern {{is kept in}} sand mold. As the metal is poured, the foam vaporizes, and the metal takes its shapes. The gas from the foam flees through the sand. The advantage {{of this process is}} that complex shaped casting can be made without draft or flash. Moverover the process has less energy consumption and less waste residues than other casting processes. The present study is to fabricate a polystyrene cutting machine to cut poly styrene to shape pattern and evaluate full mould casting process. The present work Al-Si eutectic alloy is used to produce casting. Aluminum silicon eutectic alloy generally called L-M 6 contains 10 to 13 percent by weight silicon. Due to its good casting properties, high strength to weight ratio and excellent corrosion resistance, this alloy finds applications in automobile aircraft and marine industries.

These properties can characterize not only physical parameters as it but also materials purity, components uniform distribution, <b>etc.</b> <b>Test</b> the specific conductivity for materials characterization can be use in chemical industry during materials synthesis. Specific conductivity of materials is especially important also for energy storage industry (battery, supercapacitor, fuel cell) where some electrodes and electrolyte materials with a low conductivity are used. Well known contact methods for testing the conductivity of powdered materials, solid or polymer plasticized film, (for example battery electrolyte) have several disadvantages connected with the direct contact between the test probe and the material surface. Information about conductivity includes additional resistance between probe and materials surface. This error depends significantly on the contact pressure and area of contact between probe and materials, as well as the operating range of material conductivity and its plasticity in the case polymer film. In a number of cases, (powders or thin films of a few tens of microns) this parameter is practically non-measurable due to the impossibility to attach the electrodes to material. The goal of current is to develop an effective non-destructive non-contact methods and devices for test conductivity powdered and thin film materials. Method’s background...|$|E

Includes bibliographical refences. A part-of-speech (POS) tagger is {{a system}} that uses various sources of {{information}} to assign possibly unique POS to words. Automatic text tagging is an important component in higher level analysis of text corpora. Its output can also be used in many natural language processing applications. In languages like Turkish or Finnish, with agglutinative morphology, morphological disambiguation is a very crucial process in tagging as the structures of many lexical forms are morphologically ambiguous. This thesis present a POS tagger for Turkish text based on a full-scale two-level specification of Turkish morphology. The tagger is augmented with a multi-word and idiomatic construct recognizer, and most importantly morphological disambiguator based on local lexical neighborhood constraints, heuristics and limited amount of statistical information. The tagger also has additional functionality for statistics compilation and fine tuning of the morphological analyzer, such as logging erroneous morphological parses, commonly used roots, <b>etc.</b> <b>Test</b> results indicate that the tagger can tag about 97 /% to 99 % of the texts accurately with very minimal user intervention. Furthermore for sentences morphologically disambiguated with the tagger, an LFG parser developed for Turkish, on the average, generates 50 % less ambiguous parses almost 2. 5 times faster.
