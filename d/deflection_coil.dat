5000|$|The basic {{components}} of a typical electron-beam processing device are illustrated in the figure. An electron gun (consisting of a cathode, grid, and anode) is used to generate and accelerate the primary beam. A magnetic optical (focusing and deflection) system is used for controlling {{the way in which}} the electron beam impinges on the material being processed (the [...] "workpiece"). In operation, the gun cathode is the source of thermally emitted electrons that are both accelerated and shaped into a collimated beam by the electrostatic field geometry established by the gun electrode (grid and anode) configuration used. The electron beam then emerges from the gun assembly through an exit hole in the ground-plane anode with an energy equal to the value of the negative high voltage (gun operating voltage) being applied to the cathode. This use of a direct high voltage to produce a high-energy electron beam allows the conversion of input electrical power to beam power at greater than 95% efficiency, making electron-beam material processing a highly energy-efficient technique. After exiting the gun, the beam passes through an electromagnetic lens and <b>deflection</b> <b>coil</b> system. The lens is used for producing either a focused or defocused beam spot on the workpiece, while the <b>deflection</b> <b>coil</b> is used to either position the beam spot on a stationary location or provide some form of oscillatory motion.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} ensure the {{positioning}} of the pilot and writing beams remained as constant as possible, the apple tube used a unique electron gun arrangement. The beams were produced from a single anode and two closely spaced cathodes, resulting in the beams traveling in slightly different directions. They were then magnetically focused so they crossed at a point {{just in front of}} the electron guns, where a single-slit aperture was used to clear up the signal to produce a sharp-edged elliptical beam pattern. The <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> were positioned around the aperture, so by having both beams pass by the <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> while superimposed, the deflection of both was equal. The beams then spread out again on the far side of the aperture, where a second focussing arrangement ensured both were traveling parallel to each other.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the other}} side of the ocean, the RCA team led by Albert Rose began working in 1937 on a low-velocity {{scanning}} beam device they dubbed the orthicon. Iams and Rose solved the problem of guiding the beam and keeping it in focus by installing specially designed deflection plates and <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> near the charge storage plate to provide auniform axial magnetic field. The orthicon was the tube used in RCA's television demonstration at the 1939 New York World's Fair, its performance was similar to the image iconoscope's one, but it was also unstable under sudden flashes of bright light, producing [...] "the appearance of a large drop of water evaporating slowly over part of the scene".|$|R
50|$|Electron beam {{tomography}} (EBT) is {{a specific}} form of CT in which a large enough X-ray tube is constructed so that only {{the path of the}} electrons, travelling between the cathode and anode of the X-ray tube, are spun using <b>deflection</b> <b>coils.</b> This type had a major advantage since sweep speeds can be much faster, allowing for less blurry imaging of moving structures, such as the heart and arteries. Fewer scanners of this design have been produced when compared with spinning tube types, mainly due to the higher cost associated with building a much larger X-ray tube and detector array and limited anatomical coverage. Only one manufacturer (Imatron, later acquired by General Electric) ever produced scanners of this design. Production ceased in early 2006.|$|R
5000|$|An {{advantage}} of the dynatron circuit was that it could oscillate over a very wide frequency range; from a few hertz to 20 MHz. [...] It also had very good frequency stability compared to other LC oscillators of that time, and was even compared to crystal oscillators. The circuit became popular after the advent of cheap tetrode tubes such as the UY222 and UY224 around 1928. [...] It was used in beat frequency oscillators (BFOs) for code reception and local oscillators in superheterodyne receivers {{as well as in}} laboratory signal generators and scientific research. RCA's 1931 prototype television used two UY224 tubes as dynatron oscillators to generate the vertical deflection (28 Hz) and horizontal deflection (2880 Hz) signals for the CRT's <b>deflection</b> <b>coils.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Writing to {{the cell}} was {{accomplished}} by an external cathode ray tube (CRT) arranged {{in front of the}} photoemissive side of the grid. Cells were selected by using the <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> in the CRT to pull the beam into position in front of the cell, lighting up the front of the tube in that location. This initial pulse of light, focussed through a lens, would set the cell to the [...] "on" [...] state. Due to the way the photoemissive layer worked, focusing light on it again when it was already [...] "lit up" [...] would overload the material, stopping electrons from flowing out the other side into the interior of the cell. When the external light was then removed, the cell was dark, turning it off.|$|R

40|$|Vertical Colour Selection (VCS) is {{an option}} for slim CRTs with {{increased}} sharpness and brightness. The direction of self-convergence of the DY is changed to vertical {{in order to obtain}} better spot uniformity, but the line scan direction remains horizontal. Hence, no video conversion is needed, contrary to transposed scan. In this paper we address two issues: First, there is a high risk of moiré, since the scan lines and the phosphor stripes are parallel. We propose a feedback mechanism guiding the electron beams towards the middle of the mask slots. As positive side effects, the brightness is improved and the shadow mask can be made of a cheap type of steel. Secondly, VCS <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> have to satisfy different requirements than coils in ordinary CRTs.

The topics of this research are the system kinematics and dynamics and the computerized guidance system which will allow the projectile to approach each rotor with exact timing with respect to the rotor rotation period and with very small errors in lateral positions. Kinematics studies include analysis of rotor and projectile positions versus time and projectile/rotor interactions.

5000|$|In {{an analog}} {{receiver}} with a CRT display sync pulses are fed to {{horizontal and vertical}} timebase circuits (commonly called [...] "sweep circuits" [...] in the United States), each consisting of an oscillator and an amplifier. These generate modified sawtooth and parabola current waveforms to scan the electron beam in a linear way. The waveform shapes are necessary {{to make up for}} the distance variations from the electron beam source and the screen surface. The oscillators are designed to free-run at frequencies very close to the field and line rates, but the sync pulses cause them to reset at the beginning of each scan line or field, resulting in the necessary synchronization of the beam sweep with the originating signal. The output waveforms from the timebase amplifiers are fed to the horizontal and vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> wrapped around the CRT tube. These coils produce magnetic fields proportional to the changing current, and these deflect the electron beam across the screen.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. 2014 For {{the purpose}} {{to observe and}} analyze the {{transient}} phenomena {{after the start of}} irradiation and the relaxation phenomena after the cessation of irradiation, techniques for intermit-tent electron irradiation are developed with a high voltage electron microscope, utilizing the STEM function installed in H- 1250 ST. One of the two methods developed is to make move the electron beam along a circle passing the area of interest in each cycle, which has an advantageous feature of invariant accumulated irradiation time regardless of the frequency.

40|$|Three {{dimensional}} imaging {{at multiple}} length scales {{is of great}} importance in biological research [4]. Conventional electron tomography addresses the length scale of 50 [mu]m³ to 50 [mu]m³, which lies between X-ray crystallography and light microscopy. A desirable technological advance is the scaling up of electron tomography to address large volumes {{on the order of}} 0. 5 mm³ at high resolution, and a major challenge in achieving such large scale reconstructions is reducing the time of acquisition. Electron tomography is typically a slow and tedious process. Recent advances in automated data acquisition using predictions of stage movement have lead to significant improvement [14] in acquisition speed. However, for very large scale high resolution imaging projects such as serial section tomography applied to brain circuit reconstruction [2], faster tomographic acquisition systems will be necessary. In this work, a new conical electron beam control system was designed and tested on the following 3 D imaging applications: high speed tomographic data acquisition without need for specimen tilt, enhancement of single axis tilt tomography with additional beam tilting, and object precession. Since tilting the beam requires only modification of current to <b>deflection</b> <b>coils,</b> the speed of beam tilt far exceeds mechanical tilting. Beam deflection also gives higher precision of changes in angle than mechanical tilt. Results are presented for each imaging applicatio...|$|R
50|$|A sharply focused beam of {{electrons}} (a cathode ray) is generated by the electron gun at ground potential and accelerated by the anode (the first dynode of the electron multiplier) around the gun at a high positive voltage (approx. +1500 V). Once it exits the electron gun, its inertia makes the beam {{move away from the}} dynode towards {{the back side of the}} target. At this point the electrons lose speed and get deflected by the horizontal and vertical <b>deflection</b> <b>coils,</b> effectively scanning the target. Thanks to the axial magnetic field of the focusing <b>coil,</b> this <b>deflection</b> is not in a straight line, thus when the electrons reach the target they do so perpendicularly avoiding a sideways component. The target is nearly at ground potential with a small positive charge, thus when the electrons reach the target at low speed they are absorbed without ejecting more electrons. This adds negative charge to the positive charge until the region being scanned reaches some threshold negative charge, at which point the scanning electrons are reflected by the negative potential rather than absorbed (in this process the target recovers the electrons needed for the next scan). These reflected electrons return down the cathode ray tube toward the first dynode of the electron multiplier surrounding the electron gun which is at high potential. The number of reflected electrons is a linear measure of the target's original positive charge, which, in turn, is a measure of brightness.|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the design of}} asymmetric gradient coils in a conventional cylindrical bore magnetic resonance imaging system. The gradient coils are switched on and off during the scan, and are therefore subject to Lorentz forces that cause them to buckle during the switching process. This in turn creates a pressure wave within the coil, and that gives rise to acoustic noise. We present a simplified linearized model for the <b>deflection</b> of the <b>coil</b> due to electromagnetic forces, which is amenable to solution using analytical methods. Closed-form solutions for the <b>coil</b> <b>deflection</b> and the pressure pulse and noise level within the coil are obtained.

5000|$|Rosing's {{interest}} in television — or the [...] "electric telescope", {{as he called}} it — began in 1897. Others had tried to develop a mechanical version of television. Rosing recognized the shortcomings of mechanical television; he thought that the image should be displayed electrically on a cathode ray tube (CRT). By 1902, Rosing began actual experimentation to test his ideas: he constructed a simple apparatus for electrically deflecting the beam of a CRT, which allowed him to draw figures on the tube's screen. At that time, mechanical devices scanned an image onto a selenium photoresistor, the resistance of which varied in response to the light striking it. However, selenium photoresistors responded to changes in light levels too slowly to accurately reproduce moving images. Therefore Rosing used a photocell, a piece of alkaline metal in a vacuum tube which emitted electrons in response to light. Once Rosing had developed a rudimentary working television that incorporated his two innovations — a photocell detector and a CRT display — he filed a patent application in Russia on July 25, 1907 and — on the improved version of his system, which included magnetic <b>deflection</b> <b>coils</b> around the CRT — on March 2, 1911. [...] He followed up with a demonstration of which a report was published in the Scientific American with diagrams and full description of the invention's operation. [...] During 1912-1914, he did theoretical and experimental work on magnetic lenses. In 1918, he co-founded the North Caucasian Polytechnic Institute, now the Kuban State Technological University. In the early 1920s he resided in Krasnodar (formerly: Ekaterinodar), near the Black Sea. There, in 1920, he co-founded the Ekaterinodar Physical-Mathematical Society and became its chairman, and in 1923, he wrote his booklet The Electric Telescope: Vision at a distance.|$|R
5000|$|A {{moving coil}} {{galvanometer}} {{can be used as}} a voltmeter by inserting a resistor in series with the instrument. The galvanometer has a coil of fine wire suspended in a strong magnetic field.

The torque is proportional to the current through the coil. The coil rotates, compressing a spring that opposes the rotation. The <b>deflection</b> of the <b>coil</b> is thus proportional to the current, which in turn is proportional to the applied voltage, which is indicated by a pointer on a scale.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} of this project was to study the load-elongation and creep behavior of water set single hair fiber coils at constant RH to provide some insights into their physical behavior. Single fibers were used instead of tresses to avoid complications from interfiber interactions and to simplify data interpretation. The first portion {{of this paper is}} concerned with measuring forces involved in stretching and recovery of single hair fibers water set as helical spirals. For initial uncoiling, the load is approximately proportional to the extension. With further extension a region is found in which load is proportional to the logarithm of the extension. However, as the fiber approaches traightness, once against he load is proportional to the extension. A large proportion of the extension is recoverable even after multiple extension-recovery cycles; however, some coil loss occurs, confirming a lack of true elasticity. The existence of creep confirms the absence of a true Hookean region for stretching water set single fiber coils. With no external load, most of the fiber creep (84 %) or uncoiling can be explained by fiber diameter, with thicker fibers resisting coil deformation better than thinner ones. With small added loads no meaningful relationship between creep and fiber diameter was found. However, the initial <b>coil</b> <b>deflection</b> with added load is significantly related to fiber diameter. Spiral spring theory predicts apower dependence of <b>coil</b> <b>deflection</b> on fiber diameter, and is useful for predicting the initial deflection but not the creep of water set hair curls with load...|$|R
