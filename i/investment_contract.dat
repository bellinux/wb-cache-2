40|$|This paper {{resolves}} three empirical puzzles in outsourcing by formalizing {{the adaptation}} cost of long-term performance contracts. Side-trading {{with a new}} partner alongside a long- term contract (to exploit an adaptation-requiring investment) is usually less effective than switching to the new partner when the contract expires. So long-term contracts that prevent holdup of specific investments may induce holdup of adaptation <b>investments.</b> <b>Contract</b> length therefore trades of specific and adaptation investments. Length should increase with the importance and specificity of self-investments, and decrease with the importance of adaptation investments for which side-trading is ineffective.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} is {{the first}} major systematic study of resource-for-infrastructure (R 4 I) <b>investment</b> <b>contracts</b> in Africa. It describes the terms and conditions of the R 4 I <b>investment</b> <b>contracts</b> that Chinese investors have been using in the mining sectors of resource rich countries in Africa {{since the turn of}} the century. It then shows - and that is its paramount objective - why African governments should prefer R 4 I <b>contracts</b> over traditional <b>investment</b> <b>contracts,</b> especially production-sharing agreements (PSA) and turnkey infrastructure projects. R 4 I contracts are a remarkable departure from traditional foreign direct investment (FDI), unique in mining contract history, innovative and adapted to the particular circumstances of most resource rich countries in Africa. The dissertation investigates ways in which resource rich countries in Africa can frame their mining contracts so that they can maximize infrastructure investments while minimizing the risks and costs associated with China's FDI in the mining sectors of Africa. It proposes R 4 I <b>investment</b> <b>contracts</b> as a model for taking the greatest advantage of China's mining investments in Africa. The basic mechanism is the exchange of natural resources for national infrastructure through the innovative combination of two different types of traditional <b>investment</b> <b>contracts,</b> namely a resource (minerals or hydrocarbons) contract and an infrastructure contract. China gets the resources; the host state in Africa the infrastructure. The dissertation's main argument is that the ways in which R 4 I contracts combine mining contracts and infrastructure projects offers FDI benefits greater than those provided by the mere sum of these two contract types. R 4 I <b>contracts</b> increase infrastructure <b>investments</b> exponentially by drastically reducing t ransaction costs. As a consequence, most countries that entered into R 4 I contracts attracted their largest infrastructure finance in recent years, if not since independence, even if such substantial finance does not come without its own package of risks. With the discourse on China's FDI in African mines shaped largely by insights from political science, economics and development theories, the present dissertation fills a gaping hole in that fast burgeoning Sino-African economic scholarship by approaching the issue from the perspective of contract law. i...|$|R

40|$|Valuing early-stage {{high-technology}} growth-oriented {{companies is}} a challenge to current valuation methodologies. This inability to come up with robust point estimates of value should not and does not lead to a breakdown of market liquidity: instead, efforts are redirected towards the design of <b>investment</b> <b>contracts</b> which materially skew the distribution of payoffs in favor of the venture investors. In effect, limitations in valuation abilities are addressed by designing the <b>investment</b> <b>contracts</b> as baskets of real options instead of linear payoff functions. This paper investigates four common features (covenants) of venture capital <b>investment</b> <b>contracts</b> from a real option perspective, using both analytical solutions and numerical analyis to draw inferences for a better understanding of contract features. The impact of the concept for pricing issues, valuation negotiation and for contract design are considered. It is shown, for example, how "contingent pre-contracting" for follow-up rounds is theoretically a better proposition than the simple "rights of first refusal" commonly found in many contracts. We also provide for results (such as timing of investments, lengths of rounds, choices of liquidation levels, conversion levels) that take into account full interaction of the different features considered. We document some complex facts, such as the concavity of the VC contract value depending on the amount invested at the different stages, the actual share impact of the most common anti-dilution feature, some endogenous motivation for early VC exits from otherwise performing companies and stress overall the importance of a full analysis for efficient contract negotiations and understanding. ...|$|R
