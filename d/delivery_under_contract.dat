Unfortunately, this wealth of experience is not broadly known. Drawing on the experience of a number of industrial {{energy efficiency}} programs in North America, this paper discusses several key elements of the different institutional models and some pros and cons associated with them. These elements include choices of: delivery institution, funding sources and management, target setting, contractual arrangements, and monitoring and verification processes. The objective is to highlight as clearly as possible the lessons learned in program design and implementation in key states and provinces. These findings are presented for the practical consideration of governments and utilities in their efforts to develop or upgrade their own industrial energy efficiency efforts...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{constitutes the}} final report prepared by Proteon, Inc. of Westborough, Massachusetts <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> NAS 5 - 30629 entitled High-Speed Packet Switching (SBIR 87 - 1, Phase 2) prepared for NASA-Greenbelt, Maryland. The primary goal of this research project {{is to use the}} results of the SBIR Phase 1 effort to develop a sound, expandable hardware and software router architecture capable of forwarding 25, 000 packets per second through the router and passing 300 megabits per second on the router's internal busses. The work being delivered <b>under</b> this <b>contract</b> received its funding from three different sources: the SNIPE/RIG contract (Contract Number F 30602 - 89 -C- 0014, CDRL Sequence Number A 002), the SBIR contract, and Proteon. The SNIPE/RIG and SBIR contracts had many overlapping requirements, which allowed the research done under SNIPE/RIG to be applied to SBIR. Proteon funded all of the work to develop new router interfaces other than FDDI, in addition to funding the productization of the router itself. The router being delivered under SBIR will be a fully product-quality machine. The work done during this contract produced many significant findings and results, summarized here and explained in detail in later sections of this report. The SNIPE/RIG contract was completed. That contract had many overlapping requirements with the SBIR contract, and resulted in the successful demonstration and delivery of a high speed router. The development that took place during the SNIPE/RIG contract produced findings that included the choice of processor and an understanding of the issues surrounding inter processor communications in a multiprocessor environment. Many significant speed enhancements to the router software were made during that time. <b>Under</b> the SBIR <b>contract</b> (and with help from Proteon-funded work), it was found that a single processor router achieved a throughput significantly higher than originally anticipated. For this reason, a single processor router was developed and the final <b>delivery</b> <b>under</b> this <b>contract</b> will include a single processor CNX- 500 router. The router and its interface boards (2 FDDIs and 2 dual-ethernets) are all product-quality components...|$|R

Data collected were analyzed using frequency tables, means and percentages, Ordinary Least Square (OLS) and Chow’s test models. Results from the analyses show that farmers <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming had larger land areas of cultivation and relatively younger than farmers not <b>under</b> <b>contract</b> farming.
