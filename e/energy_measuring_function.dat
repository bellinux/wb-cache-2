40|$|ABSTRACT. On the Sierpinski Gasket (SG) {{and related}} fractals, we define {{a notion of}} {{conformal}} energy Eϕ and conformal Laplacian ∆ϕ for a given conformal factor ϕ, based on the corresponding notions in Riemannian geometry in dimension n � = 2. We derive a differential equation that describes the dependence of the effective resistances of Eϕ on ϕ. We show that the spectrum of ∆ϕ (Dirichlet or Neumann) has similar asymptotics compared to the spectrum of the standard Laplacian, and also has similar spectral gaps (provided the function ϕ does not vary too much). We illustrate these results with numerical approximations. We give a linear extension algorithm to compute the <b>energy</b> <b>measures</b> of harmonic <b>functions</b> (with respect to the standard energy), and as an application we show how to compute the L p dimensions of these measures for integer values of p ≥ 2. We derive analogous linear extension algorithms for <b>energy</b> <b>measures</b> on related fractals. 1...|$|R

While Θ = θ 1, · · ·, θD ∈ EΘ denotes the joint angles, the global orientation and position are encoded by the 6 D vector (r, t). An element of the search space is given by x = (r, t, Θ).

40|$|We {{have studied}} numerically the {{dynamics}} of spin glasses with Ising and XY symmetry (gauge glass) in space dimensions 2, 3, and 4. The nonequilibrium spin-glass susceptibility and the nonequilibrium energy per spin of samples of large size L_b are <b>measured</b> as a <b>function</b> of anneal time t_w after a quench to temperatures T. The two observables are compared to the equilibrium spin-glass susceptibility and the equilibrium <b>energy,</b> respectively, <b>measured</b> as <b>functions</b> of temperature T and system size L {{for a range of}} system sizes. For any time and temperature a nonequilibrium time-dependent length scale L*(t_w,T) can be defined by comparing equilibrium and nonequilibrium quantities. Our analysis shows that for all systems studied, an "effective dynamical critical exponent" parametrization L*(t_w,T) = A(T) t^(1 /z(T)) fits the data well at each temperature within the whole temperature range studied, which extends from well above the critical temperature to near T = 0 for dimension 2, or to well below the critical temperature for the other space dimensions studied. In addition, the data suggest that the dynamical critical exponent z varies smoothly when crossing the transition temperature. Comment: 14 pages, 13 figures, 9 table...|$|R

The DOSD is straightforwardly obtained from the experimentally <b>measured</b> <b>energy</b> loss <b>function</b> data below 80 eV and atomic photo-absorption cross-section data above 100 eV. Agreement between the results of the calculation for stopping power and the experimental data is within 10 % for all ions when compared for energies greater than the Bragg peak.

40|$|Oxygen isotherms {{of human}} {{hemoglobin}} measured in distilled water and in solutions of sodium chloride in the concentration range from 0. 02 to 3. 0 M {{indicate that the}} oxygen affinity decreases up to about 1 M salt and then begins to increase. The isotherms obtained {{in the range from}} 0. 02 to 0. 6 M sodium chloride, at 37 ° and pH 7. 4, have been analyzed in terms of changes in Gibbs free energy of heme ligation, resulting from the differential interaction between the chloride ion and the two forms of hemoglobin. The maximal theoretical change in Gibbs free energy that chloride ion can exert on the oxygen binding of hemoglobin amounts to 4. 9 ± 0. 2 kcal/mol (21 ± 0. 8 kJ/mol) of hemoglobin tetramer. A plot of the logarithm of oxygen concentration at half saturation versus the logarithm of the chloride concentration has a slope of 0. 40, suggesting 1. 6 apparent chloride sites per hemoglobin tetramer. Because the interaction between chloride and hemoglobin is dependent on pH, the apparent thermodynamic linkage between chloride and oxygen binding will also include the salt dependence of the Bohr effect at pH 7. 4. The fractional change in Gibbs free <b>energy,</b> <b>measured</b> as a <b>function</b> of the chloride concentration, can be approximated by the binding isotherm between a protein and a ligand, using an association constant of 11 M- 1.

In general, energy-efficient and renewable energy technologies offer wide applications in the hotel industry. The adoption of these technologies improves energy performance and reduces dependence on fossil fuels. Hotel organizational commitment towards sustainability is highly inconsistent across the industry.
