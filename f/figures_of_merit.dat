25|$|In general, analog {{computers}} {{are limited by}} non-ideal effects. An analog signal is composed of four basic components: DC and AC magnitudes, frequency, and phase. The real limits of range on these characteristics limit analog computers. Some of these limits include the operational amplifier offset, finite gain, and frequency response, noise floor, non-linearities, temperature coefficient, and parasitic effects within semiconductor devices. For commercially available electronic components, ranges of these aspects of input and output signals are always <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{improved}} {{injection of}} carriers {{into the base}} allows the base {{to have a higher}} doping level, resulting in lower resistance to access the base electrode. In the more traditional BJT, also referred to as homojunction BJT, the efficiency of carrier injection from the emitter to the base is primarily determined by the doping ratio between the emitter and base, which means the base must be lightly doped to obtain high injection efficiency, making its resistance relatively high. In addition, higher doping in the base can improve <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> like the Early voltage by lessening base narrowing.|$|E

On {{each of the}} six days, competitors flew several laps of courses mostly involving towns or landmarks along or near the Kent and Sussex coastline, and usually involving either three or six laps totalling between 300–400 miles. Friday's course was an exception, a two lap flight on a 106-mile circuit from Lympne to the south London airport at Croydon. By Thursday morning the field had been reduced to four, the two Cygnets with No.6 leading, followed by the Brownie and then the Pixie.

40|$|A new {{methodology}} {{based on}} the concept <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> under area constraints is described for designing optimum performance differential amplifiers. First a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> is introduced that includes the three performance parameters, namely, input-referred noise, differential dc gain, and unity-gain bandwidth. Expressions for these parameters have been derived analytically and finally arrived at an expression for the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit.</b> Next it is shown how these performance parameters vary with the relative allocation of the total available area between the input and load transistors. The <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> peaks at a certain value of relative area allocation {{in the range of}} 60 % to 80 % of the available area to the input transistors. The peak value <b>of</b> <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> is a function of area. However, it is independent of biasing current (and, therefore, power consumption) subject to the minimum current (and, therefore, a minimum power) required to keep all the transistors biased in the saturation region. The peak <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> and minimum power required to achieve the peak <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> are also plotted as a function of area.

40|$|Abstract—The {{presence}} of an underlying periodicity in time-series network and service metrics {{has been used as}} a basis for some recent anomaly detection techniques. These techniques however assume the {{presence of}} a periodicity, and would benefit from the concept <b>of</b> a quantitative <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> for the strength of a given periodicity in the metric. We survey a number of potential techniques for this purpose, and find none suitable. As such, we construct such a <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> to suit our application. Use <b>of</b> the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> allows selection <b>of</b> the most appropriate period for the metric, and we present an efficient automated method for this selection. Furthermore, this <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> is a useful indicator of whether periodic analysis for anomaly detection is in fact suitable for the given metric. Finally, we suggest a number of other areas where use <b>of</b> the <b>figure</b> <b>of</b> <b>merit</b> could enhance anomaly detection using periodic analysis. I...|$|R
