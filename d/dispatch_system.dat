25|$|Large private telelocation or AVL systems send {{data from}} GPS {{receivers}} in vehicles to a dispatch center over their private, user-owned radio backbone. These systems {{are used for}} businesses like parcel delivery and ambulances. Smaller systems which don't justify building a separate radio system use cellular or PCS data services to communicate location data from vehicles to their dispatching center. Location data is periodically polled from each vehicle in a fleet by a central controller or computer. In the simplest systems, data from the GPS receiver is displayed on a map allowing humans to determine the location of each vehicle. More complex systems feed the data into a computer assisted <b>dispatch</b> <b>system</b> which automates the process. For example, the computer assisted <b>dispatch</b> <b>system</b> may check {{the location of a}} call for service and then pick a list of the four closest ambulances. This narrows the dispatcher's choice from the entire fleet to an easier choice of four vehicles.|$|E

The proposed bus <b>dispatching</b> <b>system</b> receives the real-time bus location data from the RFID sensor network. The paper provides the background and brief description of both the hardware and architecture of the RFID sensor network and the real-time bus <b>dispatching</b> <b>system.</b> The bus <b>dispatching</b> <b>system</b> continuously monitors the status of each bus and updates its expected arrival time at the depot using the real-time data from the RFID sensor network. If the expected number of vehicles falls below the required level, then the bus <b>dispatching</b> <b>system</b> will adjust the service headway and vehicle/driver assignments to minimize the impact on the service headway. The system is implemented on one of a bus lines in Bangkok. The main focus of the paper is to evaluate the performance of the implemented system by comparing the bus service qualities before and after the implementation of the real-time bus <b>dispatching</b> <b>system.</b> One month bus service data {{both before and after the}} system deployment are used in the evaluation of the bus level of service.

40|$|The {{dispatch}} {{of trucks}} and shovel {{has always been}} an important component in the success of open pit mine operations. <b>Dispatch</b> <b>systems</b> have evolved from manual to today automatic with almost no human intervention. Although <b>dispatching</b> <b>systems</b> available today are “pseudo real time ” and efficient, the optimal dispatching is realized over subsets of the fleet when dealing with large fleets. This approach certainly raises the question of optimality. In fact decomposing the fleet into sub-fleets and then optimizing each one does not guarantee optimality for the entire fleet. Moreover the system is not flexible to changes in the operation environment such as emergency breakdowns and anticipated down times. The swarm intelligence approach introduced in this paper is a new technique that uses the behaviour of social insects to model and simulate a <b>dispatching</b> <b>system.</b> Social insects are flexible in that they respond to any change in their environment, particularly those that threaten their survival. This flexibility occurs in response to chemical or physical cues produced in the environment either by the insects themselves or by external influences. Using analogies to these chemical and physical cues, a flexible <b>dispatching</b> <b>system</b> can be developed that can efficiently dispatch trucks of the entire fleet and that can adapt to changes in the truck/shovel/maintenance environment.

2500|$|The next area of {{responsibility}} involves the triage of incoming calls, providing expert systematized caller interrogation, using the script provided by the Emergency Medical <b>Dispatch</b> <b>system,</b> {{in order to determine}} the likely severity of the patient's illness or injury, so that the most appropriate type of response resource may be expedited. [...] All calls are prioritized by medical symptom/condition acuity. [...] This process may be further complicated by panic-stricken callers who scream, cry, or make unreasonable demands. [...] The trained EMD uses interpersonal and crisis management skills to sort through these distractions, taking control of the conversation, calming the caller, and extracting the necessary information. [...] This inquiry begins with the obvious questions regarding whether the patient is conscious or breathing. [...] The questioning will continue until the EMD is able to qualify a potentially life-threatening condition, at which time the closest appropriate response resource (such as a paramedic-staffed ambulance service) is notified to initiate pinpointing the call location. [...] When this occurs, the EMD will continue the questioning, attempting to gather additional relevant information, useful to determine response speed, the type of resources dispathed, or the type of equipment that the paramedics will bring to the site when they arrive. [...] In most cases, this 'pre-alert' function will not be required, and the resource will simply be dispatched when all of the required information has been gathered. [...] Ultimately, the decision on how to proceed, or when to interrupt the established process, requires the judgment of the EMD handling the call. [...] Otherwise, the manner in which this questioning proceeds is often governed by protocols, or by decision-support software.|$|E

2500|$|One of {{the first}} known {{examples}} of call triage occurring in the dispatch centre occurred in 1975, when the Phoenix, Arizona Fire Department assigned some of its paramedics to their dispatch centre in order to interview callers and prioritize calls. [...] The following year, Dr. Jeff Clawson, a physician employed by the Salt Lake City Fire Department as its Medical Director, developed a series of key questions, pre-arrival instructions, and dispatch priorities {{to be used in}} the processing of EMS calls. [...] These ultimately evolved into the Medical Priority <b>Dispatch</b> <b>System</b> (MPDS), APCO (EMD) and PowerPhone's Total Response Computer aided call handling (CACH) system. [...] Such systems were initially technologically quite primitive; in the mid-1970s the use of computers in dispatching was extremely uncommon, and those that used them were dealing with very large mainframe computers. Most such systems were based on either reference cards or simple flip charts, and have been described by lay people on more than one occasion as being like a [...] "recipe file" [...] for ambulance dispatchers. [...] The development of pre-arrival instructions presented an entirely new challenge for those involved in emergency medical dispatch; it might take eight or more minutes for paramedics to arrive at the patient's side, but dispatchers could be there in seconds. [...] Physicians began to see a dramatic new potential for the saving of lives by means of simple scripted telephone instructions from the dispatcher, and the concept of Dispatch Life Support was born. [...] Suddenly dispatchers were providing complex information and instructions to callers, and even providing guidance on performing procedures such as cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) by telephone. The concept became an area of medical research, and even EMS Medical Directors debated on the best approach to such services.|$|E
2500|$|The {{overwhelming}} majority of EMDs will perform their work in an EMS dispatch centre. [...] Occasionally this may involve some 'site work', such as on-site dispatching for large special events, but this is somewhat rare. [...] EMS dispatching may be a single, independent process, {{or it may be}} a mixed function with {{one or more of the}} other emergency services. [...] In some smaller jurisdictions, the EMS, fire and police dispatch functions, and even the 9-1-1 system may be physically co-located, but with different specialist staff performing each function. Such decisions are frequently made based on the sizes of the services involved, and their call volumes. [...] While some jurisdictions are required, generally through economics or size, to provide a single public safety <b>dispatch</b> <b>system,</b> the three emergency services have requirements and procedures that are sufficiently different that wherever possible, independent dispatching is preferred. Even in truly large, mixed (fire and EMS) services, such as the New York City Fire Department, the functions and requirements are seen as sufficiently different that an independent dispatch function is maintained for each. [...] The emergency services in question all have their own priorities, and while they are extremely important to each, those priorities often simply conflict too greatly to allow reasonable joint dispatch functions. To illustrate, in a scenario with a single dispatcher for both fire and EMS: the truck officer on a fire apparatus is requesting additional resources for a working fire with a possibility of trapped people, and two paramedics are attempting to resuscitate a dying child, but require medical direction, which request gets priority? [...] Another important consideration is workload; in many jurisdictions the call volume of the EMS system is 5-6 times as great as that of the Fire Department. [...] Asking fire service dispatchers to also dispatch EMS resources, or vice versa, may exceed the capabilities of the dispatchers. [...] Even when joint dispatching is pursued by a community, the various types of dispatch functions to support EMS, fire and police are so different that the dispatchers involved will require separate training and certification in each.|$|E
