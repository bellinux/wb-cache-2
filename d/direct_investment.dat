Economists largely favor adherence to an organized sequence of encouraging foreign <b>direct</b> <b>investment,</b> liberalizing domestic equity capital, and embracing capital outflows and short-term capital mobility only once the country has achieved functioning domestic capital markets and established a sound regulatory framework. An emerging market economy must develop a credible currency {{in the eyes of}} both domestic and international investors to realize benefits of globalization such as greater liquidity, greater savings at higher interest rates, and accelerated economic growth. If a country embraces unrestrained access to foreign capital markets without maintaining a credible currency, it becomes vulnerable to speculative capital flights and sudden stops, which carry serious economic and social costs.|$|E

The work also has a qualitative aspect, which may be summarized as a question: Why do foreign companies undertake <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> in Sweden? The basic premise {{has been that the}} companies' decisions are based on their own calculations regarding profit interests and structural conditions on the market, but these decisions are also influenced by various power relations. The aim is to discover partly the motives behind a company's readiness to enter the Swedish market, and partly the national and international power relations that furnished the institutional conditions favouring or hindering the making of <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> in Sweden. The study shows that <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> were much more extensive before 1945, above all before World War One, than has previously been assumed. Slightly more than half the <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> were made by Denmark and Norway, and the greatest contribution from the major industrial nations was made by Germany. American <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> increased in importance during the interwar years, and represented the greatest volume of activity in the foreign sector {{by the end of the}} 1930 's. Manufacturing companies were the most important before World War One, as a result of <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> in Swedish natural resources and the consumer goods industry. During the interwar years <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> inclined more to forward linkage, and the majority were made in the chemical and engineering industries. Conditions in Sweden exerted most influence on <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> before World War One - for example, Swedish tariff policy. Sweden's attempts to protect itself against the imperialism of the large industrial nations resulted moreover in 1916 in legislation which severely restricted the possibilities of making <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> in the raw materials industry. After World War One, motives connected with specific countries and owneers were more important. At this time conflicts between American and European, primarily German, interests also entered the picture. One of the circumstances affecting <b>direct</b> <b>investments</b> was the increasing importance of the Scandinavian countries in the world market. This led to altered conditions between the Scandinavian countries, and partly to the realization by international business that Sweden must be seen as a market in its own right and not just as a sub-market in the Scandinavian region. digitalisering@um...|$|R
