5|$|After {{the deal}} in Marysville fell through, ISC courted another site, this time south of Bremerton National Airport in Bremerton, WA just across Puget Sound from Seattle. Although like the Marysville {{proposal}} the proposal in Bremerton {{was to be}} partially funded with public money, the money will not come directly from taxes but instead from bonds funded by taxes, in a scheme {{similar to the one}} used to fund Kansas Speedway. Also like the Marysville proposal, the Bremerton track would be publicly owned and leased to ISC for three races per year. ISC's current proposal was met with a lukewarm response from area lawmakers and citizens, but the company <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> present an improved offer for early 2007.|$|E

25|$|In August 2015 Albanian police {{demolished}} {{the renovated}} Orthodox church of Saint Athanasius in Dhermi, as local authorities weeks earlier declared it an “illegal construction”. The Orthodox Autocephalous Church of Albania declared it a vandalistic act of desecration and {{a violation of}} church property and it also triggered diplomatic protests from Greece. This is the second demolition of the church, the first having taken place during {{the era of the}} People's Republic of Albania, but at the time the church was rebuilt by the local Orthodox Church after the restoration of Democracy in the country (1991). The Albanian government <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the church after archaeological excavations have taken place.|$|E

On the memorandum signed by the new owner, TAP Air Portugal has to maintain the country as the airline’s main hub for a minimum of 30 years. The consortium that won the company's privatization in June 2015 <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> buy 53 new Airbus aircraft for TAP.

25|$|The {{municipal}} palace {{was built}} during the railroad {{boom in the}} early 20th century. Covering an entire side of the main plaza, it today towers over the other buildings in the center. It is built in provincial Neoclassical style with massive columns and arches. However, {{the back of the}} structure is very different, as it is an irregular pattern of brickwork, which looks like it has half collapsed. In reality, the structure was never completed. Since 1906, the city <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> finish the building, but never has. Even the federal government in 1975 announced plans to not only finish the building but restore many of the churches and plazas, but they never came to fruition.|$|E
25|$|Greek {{military}} personnel total 367,450, of whom 142,950 are active and 220,500 are reserve. Greece ranks 15th {{in the world}} in the number of citizens serving in the armed forces, due largely to compulsory military service for males between the ages of 19 and 45 (females are exempted from conscription but may otherwise serve in the military). Mandatory military service is one year for the Army and nine months for the Navy and Air Force. Additionally, Greek males between the ages of 18 and 60 who live in strategically sensitive areas may be required to serve part-time in the National Guard. However, as the military has sought to become a completely professional force, the government <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> reduce mandatory military service or abolish it completely.|$|E

25|$|Most executions {{worldwide}} {{take place}} in Asia. China is the world's most active death penalty country. North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un constantly uses capital punishment against his opponents. In Islamic countries such as Iran and Saudi Arabia, the numbers of executions are also very high. Japan, Singapore, South Korea, and Taiwan belong to the few industrialized countries that have the death penalty (South Korea has a moratorium). In 2017 Mongolia repealed the death penalty, but some countries are seeing {{a return to the}} practice; in the Philippines, President Rodrigo Duterte wants to restore executions, and Turkish President Recep Erdogan <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> do so after the 2017 constitutional referendum. India executes criminals only in extreme cases. Only 26 executions have taken place in India since 1991.|$|E
25|$|Financing of {{the line}} will come {{from a variety of}} sources. There is funding in Oslo Package 3, an {{amalgamation}} of various national and local grants and toll fees, but this is insufficient to finance construction, even if it is delayed until 2027. Land-owners at Fornebu have committed 500 million 2000-kroner towards the construction of a rail transit. Ruter is considering if it should build the line as a public–private partnership. An alternative way to generate additional funding is that the land-owners pay for part of the infrastructure in exchange for a change to the zoning allowing more dense construction. Since 2013 the Ministry of Transport and Communications <b>has</b> <b>promised</b> <b>to</b> fund half the investments, although it is uncertain if this funding could be released before 2018.|$|E
