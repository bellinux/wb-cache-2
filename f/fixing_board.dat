Although the main game mechanic of tile placement is retained, players are also additionally confined by the <b>fixed</b> <b>board</b> layout.

5000|$|Like {{other games}} in the Catan series, the {{objective}} of Starfarers is to score a number of Victory Points—in this game, fifteen Victory Points are required to win the game.

50|$|The {{passenger}} terminal's {{total area}} is 327,000 m2. Approximately 247,500 m2 {{were built in}} the first phase, in addition to 11 <b>fixed</b> passenger <b>boarding</b> bridges serving 15 gates out of an original design capacity of 31 <b>fixed</b> <b>boarding</b> bridges. At the present time only 7 out of 11 boarding bridges can be used for international flight arrivals as the southern section of the terminal that hosts the remaining four gates is still unused making those gates unconnected to passport control and customs, however since domestic flights are entirely running from the operating northern section, all eleven boarding bridges can be used for domestic flights as well as the departures of international flights.|$|R

40|$|Summary An {{experimental}} and theoretical investigation {{is made of}} the method of determining the effect of ground proximity in a wind tunnel using a <b>fixed</b> <b>board</b> to represent the ground. The influence which the boundary layer on the <b>fixed</b> ground <b>board</b> has on the flow about the model has been determined from overall force measurements on three models of aspect ratios 1. 6, 3 and 8 and the twodimensional configuration has been solved theoretically. These measurements and calculations show that the boundary layer influence is most significant at the lower aspect ratios and for these configurations an experimental procedure is proposed which enables this influence upon the data to be eliminated. The form of the threedimensional boundary layer which grows on a <b>fixed</b> ground <b>board</b> beneath a low aspect ratio model is discussed {{and the reason for}} its influence upon the model explained. A brief discussion of the form of the threedimensiona! boundary layer which will grow on a runway as an aircraft passes by is given and the case of infinite aspect ratio (twodimensional flow) has been analyse...|$|R
50|$|The Historical Scenarios were {{expansions}} in {{the sense}} that parts from Settlers were required to complete the game equipment pieces - otherwise, it was an entirely self-contained game where the Settlers game mechanics were applied to historical situations; the historical scenarios were, to some extent, the precursors to the Catan Histories series of games. Like Settlers itself, the game was played to a certain amount of victory points, though each scenario had a <b>fixed</b> <b>board</b> and had unique mechanics all its own.|$|R
50|$|Like Catan, Zarahemla uses a {{somewhat}} modular board structure, {{but instead of}} individual hexes (as {{is the case of}} Catan), Zarahemla uses five strips of hexes - one five-hex strip, two four-hex strips, and three-hex strips, which could be oriented and rearranged as in the standard game. Unlike Catan, however, Zarahemlas hexes are placed on a <b>fixed</b> <b>board,</b> which itself contains the game's harbors, or trading posts. The board also contains a scoring track, which aids in keeping scores for the players.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fixed</b> <b>board</b> is a {{noticeable}} feature of Starfarers. At the beginning, {{the players have}} settled the Catanian colonies, represented by planets along the bottom edge of the gameboard. The players must expand to other planets {{in the middle and}} on the other side of the board. Along the edges of the board are the home planets of four of the five alien races (the 5-6 player expansion also includes the home planets of the fifth race), where trading posts may be established for victory points and additional benefits.|$|R

25|$|Fogg and Passepartout reach Suez in time. While {{disembarking}} in Egypt, {{they are}} watched by a Scotland Yard detective, one Fix, {{who has been}} dispatched from London {{in search of a}} bank robber. Because Fogg answers the vague description Scotland Yard was given of the robber, Detective Fix mistakes Fogg for the criminal. Since he cannot secure a warrant in time, <b>Fix</b> <b>boards</b> the steamer (the Mongolia) conveying the travellers to Bombay. Fix becomes acquainted with Passepartout without revealing his purpose. Fogg promises the steamer engineer a large reward if he gets them to Bombay early. They dock two days ahead of schedule.|$|R

50|$|Although Starfarers uses much of {{the same}} game {{mechanic}} as Settlers, there are many differences, the most notable of which was the use of a <b>fixed</b> game <b>board</b> and the use of moving ships. Like Settlers, gameplay is mainly played on the intersections of a hexagonal grid.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid genetic algorithm {{to optimize the}} sequence of component placements on {{a printed circuit board}} and the arrangement of component types to feeders simultaneously for a pick-and-place machine with multiple stationary feeders, a <b>fixed</b> <b>board</b> table and a movable placement head. The objective of the problem is to minimize the total traveling distance, or the traveling time, of the placement head. The genetic algorithm developed in the paper hybridizes different search heuristics including the nearest neighbor heuristic, the 2 -opt heuristic, and an iterated swap procedure, which is a new improving heuristic. Compared with the results obtained by other researchers, the performance of the hybrid genetic algorithm is superior to others in terms of the distance traveled by the placement head.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{an experimental}} study {{conducted in the}} Langley Vortex Facility to investigate the effects on the ground vortex of the jet passing over a <b>fixed</b> ground <b>board.</b> A jet impacting the ground can form a vortex which may materially affect the aerodynamic characteristics of a STOL airplane operating near the ground. Several {{studies have been done}} with a stationary jet exiting near and perpendicular to <b>fixed</b> ground <b>board.</b> The resulting ground effects have been documented in terms of ground vortex and aerodynamic characteristics. The ground boundary layer created in a wind tunnel facility, however is thought to affect the extent of the ground vortex. This paper reports on an investigation utilizing an isolated moving jet to eliminate the ground boundary layer. The results are compared to the existing data base and show a 30 percent decrease in the vortex penetration shown by the stationary jet conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} board {{composition}} on overall financial performance {{is not at}} all clear. One problem with measuring their relation may be that board of director composition and financial performance are endogenously determined. A second problem may be that due to <b>fixed</b> <b>board</b> terms and periodic financial reporting, the relation may be intertemporal. We develop a theory of intertemporal endoge-neity of board composition and financial performance. Using causality tests in panel regressions with three years of data for 130 closed-end mutual funds, we find only minimal evidence of intertemporal endogeneity. The evidence that board composition influences financial performance is not very strong and depends on the definitions of financial performance and board composition as well as the type of statistical model employed. We do find somewhat stronger evidence that prior financial per-formance impacts board composition, but the relation depends on how we define board composition...|$|R

For this purpose, we first give a problem setting of solving Tantrix as making a loop on a given <b>fixed</b> <b>board.</b> We then formulate it as an integer program by describing the rules of Tantrix as its constraints, and solve it by a mathematical programming solver to have a solution. As a result, we establish a formulation that can solve Tantrix of moderate size, and even when the solutions are invalid only by elementary constraints, we achieved it by introducing additional constraints and re-solve it. By this approach we succeeded to solve Tantrix of size up to 60...|$|R
