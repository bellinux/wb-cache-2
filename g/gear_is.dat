5|$|Fishing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> {{the biggest}} threat to loggerheads in the open ocean. They often become {{entangled}} in longlines or gillnets. According to the 2009 status review of loggerheads by the Fisheries Service, drowning from entanglement in longline and gillnet fishing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> the turtles’ primary threat in the North Pacific. They also become stuck in traps, pots, trawls, and dredges. Caught in this unattended equipment, loggerheads risk serious injury or drowning. Turtle excluder devices for nets and other traps reduce the number being accidentally caught.|$|E
5|$|As of 2008, {{the landing}} <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> the only {{confirmed}} {{part of the}} biplane remaining, and is {{on display at the}} Musée de l'Air et de l'Espace (French Air and Space Museum), in Le Bourget airport in Paris, the location from which L'Oiseau Blanc took off.|$|E
5|$|Loggerheads are {{considered}} {{an endangered species}} and are protected by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. Untended fishing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> responsible for many loggerhead deaths. Turtles may also suffocate if they are trapped in fishing trawls. Turtle excluder devices have been implemented in efforts to reduce mortality by providing an escape route for the turtles. Loss of suitable nesting beaches {{and the introduction of}} exotic predators have also taken a toll on loggerhead populations. Efforts to restore their numbers will require international cooperation, since the turtles roam vast areas of ocean and critical nesting beaches are scattered across several countries.|$|E
50|$|Bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> <b>gears</b> {{where the}} axes {{of the two}} shafts {{intersect}} and the tooth-bearing faces of the <b>gears</b> themselves <b>are</b> conically shaped.Bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> most often mounted on shafts that are 90 degrees apart, but can be designed to work at other angles as well. The pitch surface of bevel <b>gears</b> <b>is</b> a cone.|$|R
5000|$|Spur <b>gear</b> teeth <b>are</b> {{manufactured}} by either involute profile or cycloidal profile. Most of the <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> {{manufactured by}} involute profile with 20° pressure angle. When two <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> in mesh at one instant {{there is a}} chance to mate involute portion with non-involute portion of mating <b>gear.</b> This phenomenon <b>is</b> known as [...] "interference" [...] and occurs when the number of teeth on the smaller of the two meshing <b>gears</b> <b>is</b> less than a required minimum. To avoid interference we can have undercutting, {{but this is not a}} suitable solution as undercutting leads to weakening of tooth at its base. In this situation Corrected <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> used. In corrected <b>gears</b> Cutter rack <b>is</b> shifted upwards or downwards.|$|R
50|$|Zerol bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> an {{intermediate}} type between straight and spiral bevel <b>gears.</b> Their teeth <b>are</b> curved, but not angled. Zerol bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> designed {{with the intent}} of duplicating the characteristics of a straight bevel <b>gear</b> but they <b>are</b> produced using a spiral bevel cutting process.|$|R
5|$|Metal <b>Gear</b> <b>is</b> a stealth action {{video game}} series created by Hideo Kojima and {{developed}} {{and published by}} Konami. The series debuted in Japan on July 12, 1987 with Metal Gear {{and is one of}} Konami's best-selling franchises, with over 26.5 million units sold. The games take place in a semi-fictional universe with stories that involve a special forces agent (Solid Snake in most games) who is forced to destroy the latest incarnation of the superweapon Metal Gear, as well as having to rescue various hostages and neutralize certain renegade units in the process. Metal Gear titles have been released on numerous video game consoles, handheld game consoles, and personal computer platforms. Related novels, comics, and other dramatizations have also been released. A few of the series' main characters have also appeared in other Konami games.|$|E
5|$|The front landing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> offset to the aircraft's {{right to}} allow {{placement}} of the 30mm cannon with its firing barrel along the centerline of the aircraft. During ground taxi, the offset front landing gear causes the A-10 to have dissimilar turning radii. Turning to the right on the ground takes less distance than turning left. The wheels of the main landing gear partially protrude from their nacelles when retracted, making gear-up belly landings easier to control and less damaging. All landing gears are hinged toward the aircraft's rear; if hydraulic power is lost, a combination of gravity and aerodynamic drag can open and lock the gear in place.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} began {{to prepare for}} arrival at Sioux City, they {{questioned}} whether they should deploy the landing gear or belly-land the aircraft with the gear retracted. They decided that having the landing gear down would provide some shock absorption on impact. The complete hydraulic failure left the landing gear lowering mechanism inoperative. Two options were available to the flight crew. The DC-10 is designed such that if hydraulic pressure to the landing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> lost, the gear will fall down slightly and rest on the landing gear doors. Placing the regular landing gear handle in the down position will unlock the doors mechanically, and the doors and landing gear will then fall down into place and lock due to gravity. An alternative system is also available using a lever in the cockpit floor to cause the landing gear to fall into position. This lever has {{the added benefit of}} unlocking the outboard ailerons, which are not used in high-speed flight and are locked in a neutral position. The crew hoped that there might be some trapped hydraulic fluid in the outboard ailerons and that they might regain some use of flight controls by unlocking them. They elected to extend the gear with the alternative system. Although the gear deployed successfully, there was no change in the controllability of the aircraft.|$|E
5000|$|Spiral bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} components on rotorcraft drive systems. These {{components are}} required to operate at high speeds, high loads, and for {{a large number of}} load cycles. In this application, spiral bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> used to redirect the shaft from the horizontal gas turbine engine to the vertical rotor. Bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> also used as speed reducers ...|$|R
40|$|Geometrical {{studies of}} {{circular}} cut spiral bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> reported. Tooth profile changes heel to toe are {{studied in the}} transverse plane. Pressure angle changes are determined. The radiuses of curvature of the tooth surfaces generated by various cutter profiles are also determined. The consequences of cutter profile changes <b>are</b> explored. Crown <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> emphasized and the implications for conical <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> discussed...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Based on the torsion {{deformation}} {{the gear}} {{body and the}} contact deformation of tooth surface, the fundamental equations of load of the <b>gear</b> <b>was</b> presented, thus established the theoretical basis of the load derivation of the gearing. In this paper, the torsion deformation of the circular arc <b>gears</b> <b>is</b> analyzed first. Then the second order differential equation for the tooth surface load distribution of the involutes <b>gears</b> has <b>been</b> deduced. The equation for the load derivation of the spur <b>gears</b> <b>is</b> presented while the errors of original tooth surface are under consideration. Revision of tooth surface in order to compensate the load deviation of the plastic <b>gears</b> <b>is</b> presented in this paper...|$|R

25|$|Trim and {{stability}} of small boats can be significantly influenced by where and how the dive <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> stowed.|$|E
25|$|The Kitchen <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> {{closed to}} direct an {{increasing}} proportion of thrust forward. As the balance changes the vessel will move astern.|$|E
25|$|The drive {{within the}} casing is {{provided}} by a train of spur <b>gears.</b> Accessories <b>are</b> arranged {{on both sides of}} the driveshaft entry, in reducing order of their speed. The <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> usually plain spur gears, running in roller bearings. Idler <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> commonly used between them, to increase the spacing between accessories. Helical <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> sometimes used for the high-torque drives, typically the starter, as these give smoother running. However helical gears also generate an end-thrust, which then requires a more complicated thrust bearing to support them.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gear</b> inches <b>is</b> one {{of several}} {{relative}} measures of bicycle gearing, giving {{an indication of the}} mechanical advantage of different gears. Values for 'gear inches' typically range from 20 (very low gearing) via 70 (medium gearing) to 125 (very high gearing); as in a car, low <b>gearing</b> <b>is</b> for going up hills and high <b>gearing</b> <b>is</b> for going fast.|$|R
50|$|All-indirect {{were used}} for some very early cars, before the {{advantages}} of the direct-drive top <b>gear</b> <b>were</b> recognised. They contain no dog clutches; at the time, <b>gear</b> changing <b>was</b> still carried out by sliding the gears in and out of mesh. Once the dog clutch came into use, the further advantage of a direct-drive top <b>gear</b> <b>was</b> immediately recognised.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} steel tube, while the wings are of wooden construction, all finished with doped aircraft fabric covering. The landing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> a fixed monowheel, supplemented by a nose skid.|$|E

25|$|The landing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> of a {{tricycle}} configuration {{with all}} three wheels mounted on steel sprung gear legs. The nosewheel is free castering and the aircraft is steered with differential braking. The brakes are mounted conventionally on the rudder pedal toes.|$|E
25|$|The landing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> of {{conventional}} configuration, with bungee suspension, giving good rough field capabilities. The enclosed cabin includes a cargo {{area that is}} located on the aircraft's center of gravity, eliminating trim changes as the load varies.|$|E
25|$|Multipurpose vessels – are vessels {{which are}} {{designed}} {{so they can}} deploy more than one type of fishing gear without major modifications to the vessels. The fish detection equipment present on board also changes according to which fishing <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> being used.|$|E
40|$|A {{simulation}} method for gear hobbing and shaping of straight and spiral bevel <b>gears</b> <b>is</b> presented. The method {{is based upon}} an enveloping theory for gear tooth profile generation. The procedure is applicable in the computer aided design of standard and nonstandard tooth forms. An inverse procedure for finding a conjugate <b>gear</b> tooth profile <b>is</b> presented for arbitrary cutter geometry. The kinematic relations for the tooth surfaces of straight and spiral bevel <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> proposed. The tooth surface equations for these <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> formulated in a manner suitable for their automated numerical development and solution...|$|R

25|$|Backpacking is {{an outdoor}} {{recreation}} where <b>gear</b> <b>is</b> {{carried in a}} backpack. This can include food, water, bedding, shelter, clothing, stove, and cooking kit. Weight is necessarily key. Backpacking trips consist {{of at least one}} night and can last for weeks or months, sometimes aided by planned resupply points or drops.|$|E
40|$|Dynamical {{aspects of}} coupled {{deformable}} <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> investigated {{to clarify the}} differences of mechanical properties between the machines consist of hard materials and those of soft materials. In particular, the performances of two functions, the transmission and {{the conversion of the}} energy, are compared between the hard and soft gears systems. First, the responses of the coupled gears against a constant torque working on one of <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> focused for two types of couplings; P) a pair <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> coupled, and T) three <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> coupled with forming a regular triangle. In systems with the coupling P), we obtain trivial results that the rotational energy can be transmitted to other gear only if these <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> hard enough. On the other hand, in systems with the coupling T), the transmission of the rotational energy to one of the other gears appears only if these <b>gears</b> <b>are</b> soft enough. Second, we show the responses of this system in which one of gears have contact with a high temperature heat bath and the other gears have contact with a 0 temperature heat bath. With the coupling T), the directional rotations appear in two gears having contact with 0 temperature heat bath. Here, the direction of these rotations change depending on the noise strength...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} study {{to evaluate the}} power dissipation of <b>gears</b> <b>was</b> performed. Three low-loss <b>gear</b> models <b>were</b> manufactured using standard 20 ° pressure angle tools. Austempered ductile iron (ADI) and 20 MnCr 5 carburized steel <b>gears</b> <b>were</b> tested in an FZG gear test machine using mineral, ester and polyalphaolephine (PAO) -based oils. The results compare power dissipation, the influence of different tooth flank geometries, materials and lubricants. This work concludes that conventional power-transmission <b>gears</b> can <b>be</b> replaced by these improved and more efficient low–loss models, which can be produced using common tools and that steel <b>gears</b> can <b>be</b> successfully replaced by austempered ductile iron gears...|$|R
