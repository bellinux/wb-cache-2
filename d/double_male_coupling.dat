40|$|The {{behavior}} of a <b>double</b> <b>male</b> strain of Escherichia coli K 12 {{has been compared to}} that of its parents and a primary F' strain carrying F 14 in order to determine whether the genome of the <b>double</b> <b>male,</b> responsible for the double origin mode of gene transmission, is composed of one or two linkage groups. F-prime plasmids carrying leu and pyrB and argG and metC have been detected following mating an F- recA- recipient with the <b>double</b> <b>male.</b> Their existence strongly supports the contention that the <b>double</b> <b>male</b> is composed of a single linkage group with two integrated sex factors. Data from acridine orange curing experiments places the frequency of <b>double</b> <b>male</b> cells in the population of growing cells in the two-chromosome configuration as less than one percent. Evidence for a unique origin and terminus of DNA replication deduced by the density labelling and transduction of <b>double</b> <b>male</b> DNA supports the contention that the <b>double</b> <b>male</b> is best considered a cell with a single chromosome carrying two integrated F plasmids...|$|R

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the division of}} paid labor among gay <b>male</b> and lesbian <b>couples</b> in the Netherlands. We hypothesize that same-sex couples have a more equal division of paid labor than different-sex couples, partly because of lower marriage and fertility rates, and partly because equity norms are more strongly embraced regardless of family stage. Furthermore, we expect that traditional gender roles result in more hours of paid work by gay <b>male</b> <b>couples</b> than lesbian couples. Descriptive and OLS regression analyses are carried out on 13 waves of the Dutch Labor Force Surveys (1994 - 2007), which include 998 gay <b>male</b> <b>couples</b> and 1, 033 lesbian couples. Results support all hypotheses: same-sex couples divide paid labor more equally than different-sex couples; lesbian couples specialize less after marriage or childbirth; and gay <b>male</b> <b>couples</b> work more hours than lesbian couples. We discuss how our findings can be translated across countries...|$|R
