We defined previous owners as discouraged <b>entrepreneurs</b> and persisting owners as <b>entrepreneurs</b> who still were owners in 2016. The persisting owners include novices as well as serial and portfolio <b>entrepreneurs</b> (Lechner et al. 2016), but we excluded novice <b>entrepreneurs</b> who became business owners {{for the first time}} in 2016.

40|$|Entrepreneurial (i. e. {{business}} ownership) {{experience may}} enable some <b>entrepreneurs</b> to temper their comparative optimism in subsequent ventures. The nature of entrepreneurial experience can shape how <b>entrepreneurs</b> adapt. Using {{data from a}} representative survey of 576 <b>entrepreneurs</b> in Great Britain, we find that experience with business failure was associated with <b>entrepreneurs</b> who {{are less likely to}} report comparative optimism. Portfolio <b>entrepreneurs</b> are less likely to report comparative optimism following failure; however, sequential (also known as serial) <b>entrepreneurs</b> who have experienced failure do not appear to adjust their comparative optimism. Conclusions and implications for <b>entrepreneurs</b> and stakeholders are discussed.

Academic research into the personality tendencies of actual and potential <b>entrepreneurs</b> has generated confusing and contradictory results. Current work stresses that motivation, learnable and non-learnable characteristics, might all distinguish future <b>entrepreneurs</b> from the general population. In this study, survey data on the motivation, demographics and learnable characteristics of business students in Malaysia and the United States were used to seek answers to the following questions 1) Do <b>entrepreneurs</b> differ from the general population? 2) Do actual <b>entrepreneurs</b> differ from potential <b>entrepreneurs?</b> and 3) Do <b>entrepreneurs</b> differ across cultures? The results indicate that it is possible to differentiate <b>entrepreneurs</b> from the general public, that actual and potential <b>entrepreneurs</b> do differ and that American and Malaysian <b>entrepreneurs</b> are different...|$|R

40|$|In the {{start-up}} <b>entrepreneurs</b> face the Liability of Newness when problems and challenges often threaten business survival. Business advisory service, provided by {{public and private}} supplier contacts, can offer important knowledge and information, accompanied by various forms of assistance, and thereby decrease the entrepreneurs’ risk of failure and reduce their Liability of Newness. However, {{it is difficult to}} match the entrepreneurs’ need for such advice with the available advice. The support must meet the need. Most nations in the European Union have programs and projects that provide such support for <b>entrepreneurs</b> and SMEs. Special programs often support female <b>entrepreneurs</b> and/or immigrant <b>entrepreneurs.</b> This thesis examines the level and handling of the Liability of Newness with special focus on female <b>entrepreneurs</b> and immigrant <b>entrepreneurs</b> in Sweden. The four papers of this thesis take the perspective of these <b>entrepreneurs.</b> The research is based on a sample of 2 832 <b>entrepreneurs</b> who were interviewed (in a telephone survey) on their impressions and recollections on their need for and use of business advisory service in {{the start-up}} processes of their companies. Fulfilment of need is achieved when the need for business advisory service is matched with the right use of business advisory service. Heterogeneities as far as the level and handling of the Liability of Newness exist related to female <b>entrepreneurs</b> (vs. male <b>entrepreneurs)</b> and immigrant <b>entrepreneurs</b> (vs. non-immigrant <b>entrepreneurs).</b> Female <b>entrepreneurs</b> have a higher need for business advisory service than male <b>entrepreneurs</b> and also use more business advisory service than male <b>entrepreneurs.</b> As a result, female <b>entrepreneurs</b> can decrease the hazard rate for their companies and also reduce the Liability of Newness as their companies move toward the standard risk in their industry. Immigrant <b>entrepreneurs</b> also have a higher need for business advisory service than non-immigrant <b>entrepreneurs.</b> However, because immigrant <b>entrepreneurs</b> use business advisory service to the same extent that non-immigrant <b>entrepreneurs</b> do, immigrant <b>entrepreneurs</b> are unable to decrease the hazard rate for their companies or to reduce the Liability of Newness. The thesis makes both theoretical, methodological and practical contributions. The thesis may be of interest to government policy makers with its attention to the need and use of business advisory service by female <b>entrepreneurs</b> and immigrant <b>entrepreneurs...</b>|$|R

30|$|It {{is useful}} to make some {{distinction}} among <b>entrepreneurs</b> that delineate this experience factor. Westhead and Wright (1998) provide a starting point by defining <b>entrepreneurs</b> as those who start, inherit, or purchase a business. The result is that research focuses on {{the different types of}} entrepreneurs: first-time (novice) <b>entrepreneurs</b> and experienced (habitual) <b>entrepreneurs.</b> Habitual <b>entrepreneurs</b> are those that have had ownership in more than one business, sequentially (serial <b>entrepreneurs)</b> and/or concurrently (portfolio <b>entrepreneurs)</b> (Ucbasaran et al. 2008). Habitual <b>entrepreneurs</b> are an important group to study because of the large number of businesses they create and the unique way that they participate in venture creation activities (Spivack et al. 2014).|$|R
40|$|Support {{is being}} {{provided}} {{to increase the}} pool of novice <b>entrepreneurs</b> who have no prior business ownership experience.

To inform this policy debate, {{similarities and differences between}} novice, serial, and portfolio <b>entrepreneurs</b> in Scotland and their 354 surveyed firms are highlighted. Evidence suggests that portfolio <b>entrepreneurs</b> have more diverse resources than either serial or novice <b>entrepreneurs.</b> On average, portfolio <b>entrepreneurs</b> appear to offer more attractive growth prospects than other <b>entrepreneurs.</b> A case for support tailored to the aspirations and needs of novice, serial, and portfolio <b>entrepreneurs</b> is presented. ...|$|R

5|$|Traditionally it is Jean-Baptiste Say who is {{credited}} for coining {{the word and}} advancing {{the concept of the}} <b>entrepreneur,</b> but in fact it was Cantillon who first introduced the term in Essai. Cantillon divided society into two principal classes—fixed income wage-earners and non-fixed income earners. Entrepreneurs, according to Cantillon, are non-fixed income earners who pay known costs of production but earn uncertain incomes, due to the speculative nature of pandering to an unknown demand for their product. Cantillon, while providing the foundations, did not develop a dedicated theory of uncertainty—the topic was not revisited until the 20th century, by Ludwig von Mises, Frank Knight, and John Maynard Keynes, among others. Furthermore, unlike later theories of entrepreneurship which saw the <b>entrepreneur</b> as a disruptive force, Cantillon anticipated the belief that the <b>entrepreneur</b> brought equilibrium to a market by correctly predicting consumer preferences.|$|E
40|$|AbstractRecently, {{the term}} {{entrepreneurship}} {{has become more}} popular, especially in Indonesia. People believed that {{an increasing number of}} <b>entrepreneurs</b> could level down the number of unemployment and decrease the number of corruptions in this country. Many studies have been trying to classified different terms of <b>entrepreneurs</b> and its issues but few have studied on <b>entrepreneurs</b> in Indonesia and their motivations. Referring to what Richomme-Huet and De-Freyman (2011) had mentioned in their article, there are four types of entrepreneurs: regular <b>entrepreneurs,</b> social <b>entrepreneurs,</b> green <b>entrepreneurs,</b> and sustainable <b>entrepreneurs.</b> This study examined the classification of Indonesian <b>entrepreneurs</b> and their motivations. The data was collected by giving out a structured close-ended online survey to a number of <b>entrepreneurs</b> which were chosen purposively-random. A cluster analysis using SPSS program was used to ensure the accuracy of analysis. It is found that the majority of Indonesian <b>entrepreneurs</b> classified themselves into sustainable <b>entrepreneurs</b> where profit, planet and people is the core values of business although by observation, they seemed to care more about material profits. Moreover, their highest motivation of business was the need to increase their income...|$|R

40|$|<b>Entrepreneurs</b> pursue {{opportunities}} [for business success] {{without regard}} to resources currently under [their] control". Often cited as primary agents of economic growth, <b>entrepreneurs</b> have been extensively analysed. Many articles address the personal traits and behaviours of <b>entrepreneurs,</b> the elements of successful entrepreneurial firms, the role of <b>entrepreneurs</b> and their firms in society and their obligations to society. There seems to be general agreement that <b>entrepreneurs</b> are more comfortable with ambiguity and risk (than general corporate managers). But, it should be noted, that <b>entrepreneurs</b> are not necessarily more or less successful in business endeavours; they are just different. This paper has three parts: firstly, it briefly explores the definition of <b>entrepreneurs,</b> entrepreneurial practices and ethical decision making by <b>entrepreneurs.</b> Secondly, it describes a qualitative research project that investigated <b>entrepreneurs</b> and their ethical decision-making environment.
