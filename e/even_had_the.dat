5|$|Having {{lost all}} of its Bristol Blenheim night fighters in the raid of 16 August, Tangmere {{dispatched}} two Hurricanes from the Fighter Interception Unit (FIU) fitted with FIU airborne radar to test the device in action. RAF Coastal Command also joined in, and committed No. 235 Squadron RAF and its Bristol Blenheims. The defence was reliant on the 68 Spitfires and Hurricanes. The numerical standing meant a ratio of one RAF fighter to every four German fighters and bombers, or in other words, one British aircraft to every two German fighters. <b>Even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> fighter controllers realised {{the strength of the}} raid, there was little that could be done. Other fighters were refuelling and rearming after the attacks on Kenley and Biggin Hill and would not be available.|$|E
5|$|In 965 or 966, a Bulgarian embassy {{visited the}} Byzantine emperor Nikephoros II Phokas (r. 963–969) at Constantinople {{to receive the}} annual tribute that had been agreed by the two powers {{as the price of}} peace in 927. Phokas, flush and self-confident from a series of {{victories}} against the Arabs in the East that had led to the recovery of Crete, Cyprus and Cilicia, refused to comply, and <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> envoys beaten up. He followed this up with a show of military strength, by sending a small force to raze a number of Bulgarian border posts in Thrace.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{interviews}} {{for a job}} in Philadelphia, where she finds her potential manager, Mark (Bob Odenkirk), is remarkably like her former Dunder Mifflin regional manager Michael Scott. While this initially amuses her, Pam gradually realizes that the prospect of working under another Michael Scott is abhorrent, and her horror increases when Mark reveals that she is interviewing for a glorified receptionist's job. During a romantic dinner, Pam finally admits to Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) that <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> prospective job and boss been perfect she would not have wanted to take it, since she does not really want to move to Philadelphia, despite Jim having started his own business there.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks on}} airfields, {{on this day}} and {{throughout}} the battle, did not cause any real danger to RAF Fighter Command. Biggin Hill was never out of service during the Battle of Britain, and Kenley was out of action for only two hours on 18 August. German medium bombers, usually sent in waves of 50, could carry between 60 and 85 tons of bombs. But this {{was not enough to}} destroy an airfield. If the airfield's hangars and buildings were destroyed, work on aircraft could be done in the open in summer periods. Should the craters become too troublesome, RAF units could move to another field, not necessarily an airfield, and operate fighters on it, provided it was 700 yards long and 100 yards wide to allow for operations. The vulnerable operations buildings on some airfields were hidden underground. One flaw was the vulnerability of operations rooms. At Kenley and Biggin the sector operations buildings were above ground, but they were difficult to hit <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Luftwaffe known their location. Vital communications (telephone cables) were buried underground, making them vulnerable only to an accidental direct hit.|$|E

The decision to retreat was validated by the Duke of Richmond, who was with Cumberland's army. He wrote to the Duke of Newcastle on 30 November listing five possible options for the Jacobites, of which retreating to Scotland was by far the best for them and the worst for the government.|$|E
25|$|Rahime Perestu Sultan took ill {{and died}} in 1904 in her villa located at Maçka, Istanbul. The {{traditional}} service at which the Prophet's Nativity Poem is recited was held in her memory at the Shaziliya Dervish Convent and at the Yıldız Hamidiye Mosque. She lies at rest in the private mausoleum she built during her lifetime at the tomb of Mihrişah Valide Sultan in Eyüp, Istanbul.

25|$|For {{the first}} time in many years, Hopkins was an underdog in the betting, which led the {{confident}} Hopkins to place a $100,000 bet on himself to win the bout. (The $100K came from a sponsorship deal Hopkins had with online casino site Golden Palace; Hopkins <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> GoldenPalace.com website displayed on his back for the fight.) During promotion for the bout, Hopkins caused huge controversy by throwing the Puerto Rico flag on the floor in press conferences in both New York City and Puerto Rico, the latter conference leading to a riot in which Hopkins had to be run to safety from the angry mob.|$|E
25|$|After World War II ended, the Allies {{discovered}} that Germany was not putting as much serious effort {{into the program}} as had been previously thought. They {{had been unable to}} sustain a chain reaction. The Germans had completed only a small, partly built experimental reactor (which had been hidden away). By the end of the war, the Germans did not even have a fifth of the amount of heavy water needed to run the reactor, partially due to the Norwegian heavy water sabotage operation. However, <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> Germans succeeded in getting a reactor operational (as the U.S. did with a graphite reactor in late 1942), they would still have been at least several years away from development of an atomic bomb with maximal effort. The engineering process, even with maximal effort and funding, required {{about two and a half}} years (from first critical reactor to bomb) in both the U.S. and U.S.S.R, for example.|$|E
25|$|After the new Ottoman Sultan, Selim II, {{started a}} new war against Hungary in 1512, Pope Leo X {{authorized}} Tamás Bakócz, Archbishop of Esztergom, to proclaim a crusade against the Ottomans. About 40,000 peasants took up arms against the Ottomans and Bakócz made the Székely soldier, György Dózsa, {{the commander of the}} crusader army on 25 April 1514. After the peasants refused to pay taxes and began plundering the noblemen's manors, Vladislaus, ordered them to disband. Dózsa did not obey the king's command and routed the united army of Stephen Báthory, Ispán of Temes, and Nicholas Csáki, Bishop of Csanád, at Apátfalva on 23 May. Dózsa <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> bishop captured and impaled. The peasants seized Lipova and Șoimoș, and laid siege to Timișoara. John Zápolya, Voivode of Transylvania, came to assist Báthory who defended the town. Zápolya defeated the peasants on 15 July and captured Dózsa, who was tortured and executed.|$|E

25|$|His first {{music lessons}} were at Workman’s Circle Peretz School {{at the age}} of 14, where he participated in {{mandolin}} classes. He went on to attend Harbord Collegiate Institute, a secondary school where the students consisted primarily of the children of Jewish immigrant families. Harbord had one of the only school orchestra programs in Canada at the time, and it was here that he learned to play the tuba and saxophone, and <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to conduct. His teacher recognized his talent and encouraged his parents to send him to piano lessons. He studied under several teachers and in the years following high school, Weinzweig attained a university entrance level in both piano and theory at the Royal Conservatory. His brother, Morris, also took up the saxophone and, from a young age, the two brothers earned pocket money by playing at local events such a school dances and political rallies. Morris {{went on to become a}} leading studio musician on the saxophone.|$|E

The cruiser Aurora since 1968 has had a different version of the ensign, flanked by the Order of the Red Banner and of the Order of the October Revolution on the top sides of the star, as the Aurora was the only naval recipient of the latter order in 1967 while in 1918, the Order of the Red Banner was conferred to the ship.|$|E
25|$|Herath and Sangakkara added 35 in nine overs on {{the fourth}} morning, as Sri Lanka {{declared}} on 375 for 7. Set 378 to win, West Indies were left to face the variations of Muralitharan – who bowled doosras and normal off-spin mixed up together as the West Indian batsmen were comprehensively deceived. Four catches went to the hands of Jayawardene who fielded at silly point – not normally the position where most catches are taken, but then again, this wasn't a usual innings. The West Indians were shown up for what they were – run-of-the-mill domestic players who should never have played international cricket, bar possibly Chanderpaul who made 24, Deonarine who <b>even</b> <b>had</b> <b>the</b> cheek to smash Muralitharan for six before being deceived, bowled for 29, and Denesh Ramdin who scampered together 28. Muralitharan registered his fourteenth ten-wicket-haul in a match, {{it was the fourth}} time he had taken more than eight wickets, and Sri Lanka cruised to another 240-run victory – although, in all fairness, it was a difficult pitch to bat on, and the tourists had shown some promise with the bat. It showed that the West Indies desperately needed to sort out their contract problems before the next home season, however – their next away series being against Australia, which even a full-strength West Indies would struggle with.|$|E
