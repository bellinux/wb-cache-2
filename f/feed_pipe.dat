25|$|Where {{the network}} has reached capacity, large {{individual}} load users can be decoupled from the hot <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> say 80˚C and coupled to the return pipe, at e.g. 40˚C. By adding a heat pump locally to this user, the 40˚C pipe is cooled further (the heat being delivered into the heat pump evaporator). The output from the heat pump is then a dedicated loop for the user at 40˚C to 70˚C. Therefore, the overall network capacity has changed as the total temperature difference of the loop has varied from 80–40˚C to 80˚C–x (x being a value lower than 40˚C).|$|E

5000|$|Another {{witness to}} refute the {{accidental}} death theory was a vehicular expert {{who had studied}} {{the remains of the}} Morris Minor, and who testified that a joint on the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and the carburettor of the vehicle had been forcibly loosened to allow petrol to flow into and beneath the motor, thus discrediting earlier defence claims that excessive heat in a burning car would invariably result in the loosening of this particular joint. (At one stage as Rouse stood in the witness box to reiterate his claims the fire had been accidental, prosecuting attorney William Norman Birkett placed the actual carburettor of Rouse's vehicle in his hands, causing Rouse to become visibly nervous as he attempted to explain earlier witness testimony as to the forcible loosening of the <b>feeding</b> <b>pipe</b> between the petrol tank and carburettor of his vehicle.) ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{original}} production {{variants of}} the Merlin used an SU manufactured carburettor {{in which the}} fuel flow was metered through a float. In most circumstances this proved to be sufficient but during the air battles over Dunkirk and during the Battle of Britain {{it was found that}} whenever the Merlin was subjected to negative [...] "g" [...] forces, such as a quick [...] "bunt" [...] into a dive, the engine would briefly lose power through petrol starvation. This was because the petrol in the float was being thrown away from the <b>feed</b> <b>pipe</b> to the supercharger. The fuel injected Daimler-Benz DB 601 engine gave the Bf 109 especially an advantage over the carburettor-equipped [...] engine; no Spitfire could simply [...] "bunt" [...] and dive away from an opponent as the 109 could.|$|E
2500|$|Whilst {{all from}} the same {{manufacturer}} broadly to the same design, the Beyer, Peacocks all have slight differences; for example, the first trio have their nameplates mounted forward of the injector <b>feed</b> <b>pipe,</b> whereas Nos. 4 and 5 are central, meaning the name plates unusually read [...] "LO CH" [...] and [...] "MO NA", there being a gap where the pipe passes through! [...] All Isle of Man Railway locomotives were supplied with brass chimney numerals, whilst the ex-MNR engines received them following the 1905 merger. [...] Today No. 10 does not carry any chimney numerals, and No. 15 lost hers when her identity was returned to Manx Northern Railway No. 4 in 2007; when originally returned to traffic in 1995 she carried both numbers at once! [...] In 1946 Beyer Peacock supplied three boilers with new cast iron chimneys which were not fitted with numerals. [...] These boilers were fitted to Nos. 5, 10, and 12, which lost their chimney numerals as a result. [...] It {{was at this point}} that No. 5 and No. 12 gained small tank side number plates. 12 lost hers again when reboilered in 1981. [...] Over the years, the water tanks of each loco were patched when they leaked, resulting in each one being distinctive by their pattern of patches; this is not noticeable today as the tanks are welded and the rivets are only dummies for aesthetic purposes. [...] No. 6 Peveril in the museum does however retain her patched tanks. [...] There are several other differences for the die-hard enthusiast, such as the grab rail on the back of No.5's cab is of a different style to all the others, No. 11 has a brass safety valve bonnet (at one time carried by No. 13 have been recycled from a pre-1939 boiler fitted to No.13 prior to her 1971 reboilering), No. 4 features fleet number and three legs of man in brass on the buffer beam, etc.|$|E
40|$|A {{system of}} heat pipe {{radiators}} {{has been designed}} to provide waste heat rejection for an inertial fusion powered spacecraft capable of manned missions to other planets. The radiators are arrays of unfinned, arterial heat pipes operating at 1500 and 900 K. Liquid metal coolant carries up to 8000 MW of waste heat through <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> from on-board components (laser drivers and coil shield). The radiators do not rely on armor for protection from micrometeoroid penetration. An armored radiator design for this application with a 99 percent survivability would have a specific mass of 0. 06 to 0. 11 kg/kW at 1500 K. Instead, a segmentation of heat pipes is used, and bumpers are utilized to protect the <b>feed</b> <b>pipes.</b> This design reduces the specific mass to 0. 015 to 0. 04 kg/kW for the coil shield radiator (1500 K) and 0. 06 to 0. 12 kg/kW for the laser driver radiator (900 K) ...|$|R

The T110 was first built in 1953 and introduced as a 1954 model. The originally cast iron cylinder block and head soon were replaced with a light alloy cylinder head with special airways to improve cooling and austenitic iron valve seat inserts. The external oil <b>feed</b> <b>pipes</b> were also replaced with internal oilways via the pushrod tubes.|$|R

Many takes ended with the wooden drum sticks broken against the rims, sending shards of wood flying off-camera.
