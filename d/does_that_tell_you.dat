40|$|The {{pedestrian}} narrative {{about the}} Greek financial crisis and default {{is that the}} country was fiscally mismanaged {{for a long time and}} failed to carry out needed structural reforms that could have improved economic growth prospects and enhanced the country’s creditworthiness. Therefore, a default and debt restructuring were inevitable sooner or later—and certainly so once the financial markets were informed, as happened in October 2009, that prior governments had underestimated their budget deficit and public debt figures. The prosaic tale of the supposed inevitability of the Greek tragedy has been endorsed, for example, by a prominent economic historian: “Since independence in the 1830 s, Greece has been in a state of default about 50 percent of the time. <b>Does</b> <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> something?” In reality, Greece’s road to default and debt restructuring in 2012 was not at all straightforward—and there was no historical inevitability about it, either. ...|$|E

40|$|History. We {{extended}} {{the editorial board}} and agreed with the BMA to share the profits of the journal with the Thoracic Society, to the considerable benefit of the Society. One of the pleasures of academic life was to search the old literature for a reference; the smell of dusty volumes, the quiet of the library, and the interest of finding those completely unexpected papers close to the one you were looking for. How much the modern researcher misses by simply sitting at a computer screen. Try looking through old Thorax volumes. You will find the first descrip-tion of mesothelioma, Richard Doll’s first paper (no statistics), results of lung cancer resection not bettered today, the first papers on mesothelioma in erionite exposure, early papers on bronchopul-monary aspergillosis and occupational asthma, and {{a description of the}} morn-ing dip in asthma. In 1981 we published a short series of papers to mark the bicentenary of Läennec’s birth. We were pretty strict on the length of papers and I was a ruthless remover of unnecessary words and sentences, but by 1980 we needed to expand to monthly publication. The work was becoming impossible from a full time post so I negotiated a part time salary for my successor, urged on him the need for seeking greater editorial help, and gratefully handed over to Alistair Brewis. It had been a wonderful experi-ence of continuing medical education without the need to fill in forms and satisfy appraisers. Now, next time you are in the library, take this test. Open an early volume at random at three or four pages and then do the same in a recent one. What <b>does</b> <b>that</b> <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> about life...|$|E

And if you meet (as you will meet) with people better and wiser than yourself, then so much the better for you; for they will love you, and be glad to teach you when they see that you are living the unselfish and harmless life; and that you come to them, not as foolish Critias came to Socrates, to learn political cunning, and become a selfish and ambitious tyrant, but as wise Plato came, that he might learn the laws of Lady Why, and love them for her sake, and teach them to all mankind.
