40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} {{experimental}} investigations {{in order to}} study the influence of <b>drawing</b> conditions on temperature rise and <b>drawing</b> stress in cold <b>drawn</b> copper wires. In the multipass <b>drawing</b> machine, the temperature rise and <b>drawing</b> stress are measured with thermocouples and load cell systems, respectively, for different <b>drawing</b> speeds. The results obtained show that the <b>drawing</b> stress and temperature rise vary during the <b>drawing</b> process. This certainly comes from the variation of the friction coefficient and the flow stress of the material depending on the <b>drawing</b> speed. From the experimental results, a relationship between temperature rise, <b>drawing</b> stress and friction coefficient is built. Based on this, a modification of Avitzur's model is presented. This new model can help to select the process parameters which satisfy the conditions of minimum <b>drawing</b> stress for copper material...|$|R

40|$|Traditional graph <b>drawing</b> {{algorithms}} {{can also}} be called one-shot algorithms because given a graph as input, they typically construct a <b>drawing</b> only once. However, in several applications, such as software engineering and database design, users interact extensively with a displayed graph, continuously adding or deleting its vertices and edges. In such a scenario, a graph <b>drawing</b> system should update a <b>drawing</b> each time the displayed graph is updated by the user. Unfortunately, traditional <b>drawing</b> algorithms may not be suitable in such situations.

40|$|AbstractA straight-line planar <b>drawing</b> {{of a plane}} graph {{is called}} a convex <b>drawing</b> if every facial cycle is <b>drawn</b> as a convex polygon. Convex {{drawings}} of graphs is a well-established aesthetic in graph <b>drawing,</b> however not all planar graphs admit a convex <b>drawing.</b> Tutte [W. T. Tutte, Convex representations of graphs, Proc. of London Math. Soc. 10 (3) (1960) 304 – 320] showed that every triconnected plane graph admits a convex <b>drawing</b> for any given boundary <b>drawn</b> as a convex polygon. Thomassen [C. Thomassen, Plane representations of graphs, in: Progress in Graph Theory, Academic Press, 1984, pp. 43 – 69] gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a biconnected plane graph with a prescribed convex boundary to have a convex <b>drawing.</b> In this paper, we initiate a new notion of star-shaped <b>drawing</b> of a plane graph as a straight-line planar <b>drawing</b> such that each inner facial cycle is <b>drawn</b> as a star-shaped polygon, and the outer facial cycle is <b>drawn</b> as a convex polygon. A star-shaped <b>drawing</b> is {{a natural extension of}} a convex <b>drawing,</b> and a new aesthetic criteria for <b>drawing</b> planar graphs in a convex way as much as possible. We give a sufficient condition for a given set A of corners of a plane graph to admit a star-shaped <b>drawing</b> whose concave corners are given by the corners in A, and present a linear time algorithm for constructing such a star-shaped <b>drawing...</b>|$|R
