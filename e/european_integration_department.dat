40|$|This study {{consists}} of two main themes. The goal that {{is central to the}} first theme is to research which factors determine the position of member states towards <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> Specifically, we study the effects on a member state’s position towards <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> of (1) public support for <b>European</b> <b>integration,</b> (2) political ideology of a member states’ government, (3) the level of Europeanization of a member state, and (4) the decision-making power a member state has in the Council of the European Union. The goal central to the second theme is to study the effect of the position towards <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> on actual compliance both directly and indirectly via the willingness of member states to comply with specific directives. That is, we test whether a more positive view towards <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> also leads to more compliance with EU directives. In our analysis, we find support only for the expectation that the public’s position towards <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> is related to the government’s position towards <b>European</b> <b>integration,</b> and also for the expectation that the main political ideology of a member state is related to this position towards <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> The other hypotheses were not supported by the data...|$|R

40|$|France’s {{relationship}} with <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> is traditionally complex and characterized by regular ups and downs. Since {{the early days}} of <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> these relations have been punctuated by regular crises. The rejection of the Constitutional Treaty at the French referendum of 29 May appears to signal {{the beginning of a new}} phase. Yet this assertion is not self-evident. France has usually had contradictory and unstable attitudes towards <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> In France, as elsewhere, <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> was subject to a ‘permissive consensus’. European Union (EU) affairs were never central to political debates but neither governing parties nor major interest groups or public opinion were openly hostile to <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> EU policy-making in France was limited to negotiations among political, economic and bureaucratic e´lites. Arguably this has changed since the early 1990 s, as <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> has become a more salient political issue ( [...] .) ...|$|R
40|$|Public opinion has {{increasingly}} {{become a political}} force in the <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> process. At present, {{it appears that the}} people’s attitude towards the <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> is relatively skeptical. How can we expect that the attitude towards <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> will evolve in the future? This paper tests the extent to which diffusion theory can serve as a model to explain the development of attitudes to <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> policy in Sweden from 1999 until 2009. The policy specific approach is grounded in a commitment to the importance of keeping the concept of <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> relatively constant and comparable over time. The study tests the diffusion theory’s prediction of an increasingly positive attitude towards the <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> This paper is also testing the diffusion theory’s explanation for changes in attitudes to <b>European</b> <b>integration,</b> the diffusion process and the weakening of differences between groups and orientations. The paper’s quantitative analysis of data from the Swedish European parliament election surveys reveals that the attitude towards <b>European</b> policy <b>integration,</b> in line with the diffusion theory, has been improved over time. There is, however, no clear evidence that a diffusion process is the cause of this development...|$|R

40|$|This article {{explores the}} spatiality of post-Miloscaronevicacute Serbian {{identity}} {{in the context of}} <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> The fall of the Miloscaronevicacute regime has prompted Serbiarsquos political rehabilitation in Europe, paralleled by its pursuit of <b>European</b> <b>integration.</b> The article posits that <b>European</b> <b>integration</b> of post-socialist newcomers is a two-sided spatial process.
