He demanded that <b>he</b> <b>talk</b> to someone from the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and said he wanted {{media coverage of the}} incident. [...] "I do not need publicity myself," [...] he said. [...] "I only need to arrange a press conference for the whole world community and the media, and that someone from the Norwegian government promises me and the world community that they will ensure that the United Nations (UN) in New York attempts to open all corridors in Bosnia to feed people in Bosnia so they can survive the winter." [...] Keč indicated that if this did not lead to anything, he would go to the UN himself and that his friends would support him. He gave the authorities one hour to meet his demands before he would fly to another destination.|$|E
500|$|After being {{recognized}} as 1928 national champions, Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football team struggled {{during the next}} two season. Georgia Tech football coach William Alexander began looking for a new assistant. During 1930 football season, Alexander sent his line coach, Mac Tharpe, to scout future opponent North Carolina, playing Tennessee in Knoxville. Tharpe's car broke down {{and by the time he}} reached Knoxville, the game was over. Tharpe asked Tennessee head coach Bob Neyland for information, who suggested that <b>he</b> <b>talk</b> to Dodd. When Tharpe returned to Atlanta he told Alexander: [...] "Dodd's analysis of Carolina is better than any scouting report that I could have made." [...] Alexander was also impressed by reports of Dodd's performance during games. Dodd joined Alexander's staff as an assistant coach on December 28, 1930. Dodd served as an assistant coach at Tech for 14 years, even though he received many offers for head coaching positions from other schools during that time frame. Dodd lionized Coach Alexander which was later reflected in his coaching style. [...] "He taught me to treat athletes as men, not boys – to never use their failings as an alibi for a loss", Dodd said.|$|E
