Apocalypse hoped to lure the Twelve into empowering him with their energy, but eventually, the mutants realize their true predicament and Apocalypse teleports away.|$|E
6000|$|And so {{the twenty}} minutes' law passed into an infinity. We leave the wicked Bechamel {{clothing}} himself with cursing {{as with a}} garment,--the wretched creature has already sufficiently sullied our modest but truthful pages,--we leave the eager little group in the bar of the Vicuna Hotel, we leave all Bognor as we have left all Chichester and Midhurst and Haslemere and Guildford and Ripley and Putney, and follow this dear fool of a Hoopdriver of ours and his Young Lady in <b>Grey</b> <b>out</b> upon the moonlight road.

Had a policeman intervened because their lamps were not lit, Hoopdriver had cut him down and ridden on, after the fashion of a hero born. Had Bechamel arisen in the way with rapiers for a duel, Hoopdriver had fought as one to whom Agincourt was a reality and drapery a dream. It was Rescue, Elopement, Glory! And she by the side of him! He had seen her face in shadow, with the morning sunlight tangled in her hair, he had seen her sympathetic with that warm light in her face, he had seen her troubled and her eyes bright with tears. But what light is there lighting a face like hers, to compare with the soft glamour of the midsummer moon? ...|$|E

50|$|Danny happens {{across two}} children, 18-year-old April Donadio and Tim, her younger brother, and picks them up. Meanwhile, Grey {{encounters}} a disoriented pregnant woman, {{who does not}} realize the dissolution of society around her, shopping for paint for her baby's bedroom in an abandoned Home Depot. She is Lila Beatrice Kyle, Brad Wolgast's divorced wife. Subsequently, Grey is mistaken {{as one of the}} workers and ends up helping Lila paint her house, and a bond is forged between the two. Danny and company drive to a stadium outside of Denver that was designated as a rescue site, only to discover it full of thousands of dead bodies. Soon after, Danny and April meet Kittridge, who successfully escaped the virals and military at Denver. After traveling several miles together, they stumble upon a FEMA semi-trailer full of survivors. Grey (who is being tracked by satellite) and Kyle are captured by Guilder and taken to a research center. Kittridge and company, with the help of Major Frances Porcheki, arrive at a refugee site just outside the research center. It emerges that the government is expecting the virals to attack the refugee camp, and, rather than moving the refugees, is going to wait until that happens in order to bomb it. While Danny and April escape in the bus, Kittridge and Tim do not, and they are killed by the bomb. Grey manages to escape after apparently killing Suresh, a medical examiner, and Nelson, then takes Guilder hostage. As Grey, Guilder, and Lila try to escape in a helicopter, the bombs fall and the helicopter crashes. Guilder knocks <b>Grey</b> <b>out</b> with a chunk of concrete.|$|E
