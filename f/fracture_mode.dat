40|$|It is now {{well-known}} that {{in plate}} problems with through-the-thickness cracks in-plane shear and anti-plane loadings generate coupled three-dimensional <b>fracture</b> <b>modes.</b> The dominance domain {{and intensity of}} the singular states associated with these 3 D <b>fracture</b> <b>modes</b> are functions of {{the intensity of the}} primary loading (KII and KIII) and Poisson’s ratio. A similar situation takes place for V-shaped notches. However, for geometrically similar notch geometries subjected the same nominal stress the intensity of the coupled modes is also a function of the plate thickness. Despite this almost all 3 D effects are currently ignored in industrial standards and fracture assessment codes. Recent theoretical and numerical studies have demonstrated that in many practical situations the intensities of the coupled <b>fracture</b> <b>modes</b> for cracks and sharp notches are not negligible and can influence fracture conditions. The current paper extends this conclusion to rounded notches. By using the finite element modelling it is demonstrated that the intensity of the stress states associated with the coupled <b>fracture</b> <b>modes</b> in a sufficiently thick plate weakened by a rounded notch can exceed the magnitude of stresses due to the primary loading. This means that the coupled modes can dominate the stress state {{in the vicinity of the}} notch root and be primary responsible for fracture initiation. F. Berto, A. Kotousov, P. Lazzarin, L. P.

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} of the penetration and perforation of high-strength steel plates struck by hardened steel projectiles have shown that under certain test conditions the projectile may fracture or even fragment upon impact. Simulations without an accurate failure description for the projectile material will then predict perforation of the target instead of fragmentation of the projectile, and thus underestimate the ballistic limit velocity of the target plate. This paper presents an experimental investigation of the various deformation and <b>fracture</b> <b>modes</b> that may occur in steel projectiles during impact. This is studied by conducting Taylor bar impact tests using 20 mm diameter, 80 mm long, tool steel projectiles with three different hardness values (HRC 19, 40 and 52).

The key finding in comparing their test results and a detailed large strain FEA results was that the Mises stress distribution at the limit bending load of a flawed cylinder {{was similar to that}} of a flawless cylinder; specifically, in case of collapse, the Mises stress exceeded the true yield stress of a material for the whole “volume” of a cylinder with a nominal wall thickness. Based on this finding, a failure criterion applicable to large strain FEA results of wall-thinned straight pipes *Title Page 2 under a bending load that can predict both <b>fracture</b> <b>mode</b> and limit bending load was proposed and was named the Domain Collapse Criterion (DCC). DCC predicts the limit bending load as the lower value of either the Mc FEA, which is the load at which the Mises stress exceeds the true yield strength 	of a straight pipe for the whole “volume” with a nominal wall thickness (fracture mode: collapse), or the Mc FEAb, which is the load at which the Mises stress in a section of the flaw ligament exceeds the true tensile stress (fracture mode: cracking). The results showed that the DCC could predict the <b>fracture</b> <b>mode</b> appropriately and the experimental limit bending load fundamentally on the conservative side within a maximum 20 % difference regardless of the <b>fracture</b> <b>mode.</b> Another advantage of the DCC is that it uses the true yield and true tensile strength as the critical strength of the material and not the ambiguous flow strength...|$|E
