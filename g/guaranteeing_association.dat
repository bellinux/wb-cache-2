40|$|The {{activity}} of the Municipal Savings Bank {{of the city of}} Łódź (MSB) in the period of the great economic crisis (1930 – 1935) is the object of this article. The Savings-bank began its activity on 31 October 1930 {{on the basis of the}} Polish Republic President’s order of 13 April 1927 about municipal saving-banks, and supplemented by the executive provisions of both the Minister of Internal Affairs and the Minister of Treasury on 26 March 1928. It functioned on the basis of the Bank Charter confirmed by the Provincial Governer of Łódź on 31 July 1930. It was one of the many institutions of this type acting in the Second Republic of Poland. The main reason of setting up the MSB in Łódź was to make saving easier and to protect savings against speculation and loss, and also, to make giving a “cheap” credit more available. The Savings Bank had the personality of a public institution of public character and this largely determined the aims and the principles of its functioning. In the first part of this article was introduced the outline of the development of savings banks on the Polish land during the period of the Partitions of Poland and after regaining independence by Poland (till 1935), while in the principal part were presented the legal and organizational bases of functioning of the MSB in Łódź; besides the bank’s activity concerning its passive operations (accumulating savings deposits) and the active ones (giving credits and loans) were analysed. A lot of place was dedicated to the organizational structure of the Savings Bank, and especially to the range of its powers’ operation – the Council and the Management (the Board), and also to the Auditing Committee. The city of Łódź played an immense role as a formal founder of the MSB as well as a <b>guaranteeing</b> <b>association.</b> It was the guarantor of the functioning stability of the Savings Bank. The municipal authorities made, among other things, a list of losses that were result of giving credits and loans by the Savings Bank, which borrowers were not able to pay off. Yet, it must be underlined here that the property of the Savings Bank was administered separately and legally separated from the commune property, because – having its own wealth – the Savings Bank was responsible for its liabilities with regard to its creditors. In spite of unusually difficult economic conditions in which the savings bank acted and “irresponsible actions” of the first authorities, it managed to survive the period of great economic crisis in a comparatively good economic shape. It was proved, among others, by the systematic growth of the number of passbooks as well as by the amount of the savings in them, and also – despite the break down in 1933 – by the sums of given credits and loans. MSB enjoyed a wide confidence among the local society, and especially among its “average and lower” classes which made up its basic customers...|$|E

40|$|Aim: The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{investigate}} what differences there are between a credit union that is connected to Sweden’s Credit Association and an independent association, and how these differences have affected the union’s success.   Method: A qualitative study has been made by means of email and telephone interviews. Respondents were chosen from Sweden’s Credit <b>Association,</b> Credit <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Association</b> in Gävleborg and Övre Norrland <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Association.</b> The interviews were then analyzed {{in the light of}} our theoretical studies.   Result and conclusions: We have found that there are three major differences between the unions. One difference is the area they operate in, Övre Norrland credit union has an advantage in operating in a sparsely populated area where demand for these compounds is greater. The second difference is how unions are organized, we have concluded that there is not an advantage to belong to Sweden’s Credit Association. The third major difference we see is the risk awareness among unions, associations that are connected to Sweden <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Association</b> are experiencing {{a false sense of security}} and thereby take risks affecting the business.   Suggestions for future research: In this work the <b>guarantee</b> <b>association</b> in Gävleborg represents all affiliated unions to the Swedish association. A further study could include more of the compounds that are connected to Sweden's Credit Association, in order to get more width in the work. Another suggestion for further research in this area is to investigate members and banks views on credit unions, in order to see how knowledge and awareness of these associations differ between different regions.       Contribution of the thesis: The essay has increased the understanding of the factors that may be crucial to the success of this type of organizations. We have found that the management of credit <b>guarantee</b> <b>associations</b> must be involved in managing the business and establish guidelines. They must also ensure that employees are risk aware and not take unnecessary risks.   Key words: Credit Guarantee, small businesses, creditors, assets, organizational structure...|$|R

40|$|The {{financing}} of small-medium enterprises (SME' s) shows a great dependence on short term borrowing from banking institutions and savings banks.

This study provides a model for the valuation of cost and implicit benefits associated with loan guarantee programmes. Empirical results indicate that the use of LGAs is likely to differ among SMEs depending on company size and ebt fincial cost. The relativel high cost of the loan guarantee is not always fully compensated with a similar reduction in the interest rates of the financing hindering the full development of the schemes. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyse the impact of the techniques foreseen in the Basel Agreement II (BII) for mitigating the risk of default on bank loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs). In particular, we will conduct an analysis of the effect of the guarantees that the Loan <b>Guarantee</b> <b>Association</b> (LGA) offer to the SMEs on the assignment of capital requirements of the financial entities under BII. At the same time, the study will examine the effect of this guarantee on the credit risk premium that the financial entities should charge their clients, and whether this foreseeable decrease in the interest rates applicable to the SMEs is compensated by the cost of the guarantee. The results show that, considering that the cost of the LGA guarantee in Spain is around 0. 68 %, it will be advantageous for an SME with the annual sales of less than or equal to € 5 million to request this guarantee whenever the probability of default (PD) of the LGA is < 1. 1 %, if the approach utilised by the financial entity is the Internal Ratings-Based (IRB) and the SME is considered as corporate; however, if the SME is included in a regulatory retail portfolio, then the limit for the PD of the LGA decreases to 0. 71 %. On the other hand, when the approach utilised is the Standardised one, then will be profitable for an SME treated as retail to request this guarantee whenever the PD of the LGA is < 3. 35 % (3. 95 % for corporate exposures) ...|$|R
