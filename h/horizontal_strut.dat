2500|$|The D.XVI had a fully {{cantilevered}} fabric covered {{parasol wing}} mounted above the fuselage {{on a pair}} of N-form struts from the lower fuselage. [...] These struts were laterally stabilized with a near <b>horizontal</b> <b>strut</b> on each side, joining the upper fuselage and {{the upper end of the}} rear member of the N. In plan the wing was straight tapered with blunt tips and included a trailing edge cut-out to improve upward vision from the cockpit. The wing was quite thick and the ailerons short.|$|E
5000|$|... and Sir Thomas Bouch {{was blamed}} for the catastrophe. He had under-designed the {{structure}} and used brittle cast iron for critical components, especially the lugs which held tensioned tie bars in the towers. It was these lugs which fractured first and destabilised the towers in the high girders section. The bolt holes in the lugs were cast, and had a conical section, so all the load was concentrated at a sharp outer edge. Such conical bolt holes were used for critical <b>horizontal</b> <b>strut</b> lugs as well, and weakened the structure substantially. The towers of the high girder section were heavily loaded and were very top heavy, making then susceptible to toppling. The towers failed during the storm as the train was travelling over, and a chain reaction followed as each of the towers in the high girders section collapsed. In 1887 the bridge was replaced by William Henry Barlow with a much more substantial bridge, which {{was at that time}} the longest railway bridge in Europe, at just over 2 mi long (Europe's longest bridge today is the Oresund Bridge).|$|E

These were long and joined to {{each other with a}} pair of transverse <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts.</b> There were three further struts per float to the fuselage:one from the forward part rearward to the engine bulkhead and two from a common point further aft to the two wing spars, joining the lower wing struts from below.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the design, analysis, and experimental {{validation of the}} passive case of a variable stiffness suspension system. The central concept {{is based on a}} recently designed variable stiffness mechanism. It consists of a horizontal control strut and a vertical strut. The main idea is to vary the load transfer ratio by moving the location of the point of attachment of the vertical strut to the car body. This movement is controlled passively using the <b>horizontal</b> <b>strut.</b> The system is analyzed using an L 2 -gain analysis based on the concept of energy dissipation. The analyses, simulation, and experimental results show that the variable stiffness suspension achieves better performance than the constant stiffness counterpart. The performance criteria used are; ride comfort, characterized by the car body acceleration, suspension deflection, and road holding, characterized by tire deflection...|$|E
40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out on a {{rudimentary}} four-wheel landing-gear arrangement to understand the flow physics of this configuration. Measurements carried out included oil-flow visualization, steady surface pressures and two-dimensional particle image velocimetry measurements in the near wake at a Reynolds number based on wheel diameter of 1 � 106. The surface visualization demonstrated the significantly asymmetric behavior of the flow on both {{the front and back}} wheel. The surface-pressure data show that separation is earlier on the wing side as opposed to the ground side for both wheels, caused by the presence of the vertical strut. The data show that the truck and strut are dominant contributors to the total drag. The off-body measurements in the near wake document the confluent wakes from the wheel and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>strut</b> leading to a three-dimensional unsteady wake. The data presented here provide a comprehensive picture, both quantitatively and qualitatively, of the flow over a rudimentary landing gear and are useful for validation of computational fluid dynamics efforts in addition to understanding the flow physics of such configurations...|$|E

50|$|The SPCA 10 was a {{parasol wing}} three-engined flying boat of {{all-metal}} construction. Its one-piece wing had a rectangular central region and trapezoidal outer areas, the latter carrying narrow ailerons {{over the whole}} of their trailing edges. The primary wing structure {{had a pair of}} steel spars and duralumin ribs. Unlike the rest of the aircraft, the wing was fabric covered. It was braced to the upper hull by a pair of parallel, vertical struts to each spar but stabilized with N-struts out to the floats, which were themselves braced to the outer wing spars with pairs of outward-leaning struts as well as by <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts</b> to the mid-hull. All these struts were steel tubes enclosed in streamlined casings.|$|R
2500|$|The hull, {{like the}} rest of the aircraft, was {{all-metal}} and rectangular, with flat sides and top. Its planing bottom was also flat, with two steps. Stability on the water was provided by long, stepless floats on each side, strut-mounted from the wings a little outside the engines and braced to the fuselage with a parallel pair of <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts.</b> [...] The hull tapered in plan to the tail, where the empennage was again rectangular, with a broad fin reaching out beyond the end of the hull and carrying a balanced rudder. [...] The tailplane was mounted on the fin about one third of the way up, braced from below with a single strut on each side, and carried narrow-chord elevators.|$|R

50|$|This {{bridge is}} the third bridge to cross the river at this location. The first bridge was a wooden {{structure}} completed in 1857, but washed away in a flood in 1859. The second bridge was a four-span Pratt truss bridge built in 1887. It spanned the northern industrial district that was developing {{on both sides of}} the river. The 1887 bridge was very ornate, featuring finials on each top corner and a band of scrolls, crosses, and lines between them. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts</b> and guard railings used X-shapes as a pattern. In 1950, the bridge was raised 20 feet to allow barges and larger boats to pass underneath. The old bridge was removed in 1985, but a single span of the bridge lives on as the Merriam Street Bridge that connects Nicollet Island to the St. Anthony section of Minneapolis.|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of deep excavations {{is affected by}} the stiffness of various structural components (e. g. retaining walls, <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts,</b> vertical piles). For reinforced concrete structures, the operational stiffness (i. e. the bending stiffness and axial stiffness under working conditions) may be different from the nominal stiffness due to imperfections in the concrete (e. g. cracks). In addition, the operational stiffness may change as the excavation proceeds. To investigate how the operational stiffness of the concrete structural components affects the predicted {{performance of}} excavations, finite element analyses were conducted on an example 3 D basement excavation using a top-down construction method. Results indicate that the wall stiffness mainly influences the magnitude of the wall deflection and ground movements, whereas the stiffness of the horizontal beams and slabs influences both the magnitude and pattern of the deformation. This research can be used to select appropriate analysis procedures for design purposes, and for the prediction of the performance of completed deep excavations. © 2014 Taylor and Francis Group, London...|$|R

2500|$|The pusher {{configuration}} [...] Siemens-Halske Sh 10 five cylinder radial was aerodynamically faired {{into the}} upper wing trailing edge but was not structurally connected to it; instead, four tubes from the fuselage formed the engine mounting. The fuel tank was within the forward section of the upper wing, feeding the engine by gravity with some pressure assistance. The fuselage was of mixed construction. From the nose to the lower wing leading edge, a region which included the two cockpits, it was a flat sided wooden structure, covered in plywood; aft, it was built from wire braced, welded steel tubes and fabric covering. This section included the lower wing mounting. The tail surfaces were fabric covered, over mixed steel and duraluminum frames. The incidence of the tailplane could be adjusted for pitch trimming.

40|$|The metal {{additive}} manufacturing industry is rising {{and so is}} the interest in new lattice structures with unique mechanical properties. Many studies have already investigated lattice structures with different geometries and their influence on mechanical properties, but {{little is known about the}} effect of specific processing characteristics that are inherent to metal {{additive manufacturing}}. Therefore this study investigates the effect of two crucial steps in the manufacturing process: the build orientation selection and heat treatment. In total the microstructure and static mechanical properties of five different orientations and three heat treatment conditions were evaluated using Ti 6 Al 4 V diamond like lattice structures. The results show a significant decrease in mechanical strength for samples that are built diagonally and a transformation of the microstructure after a HIP (hot isostatic pressing) treatment, resulting in a lower maximum strength, but higher ductility. In general, <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts</b> should be avoided during manufacturing, unless the applied load after manufacturing can be properly supported by other struts. Both a stress relief heat treatment and a HIP treatment can be used in statically loaded applications, whereas a HIP treatment is believed to be beneficial for dynamically loaded applications.

5000|$|The trusses are the {{defining}} {{feature of the}} bridge. Two 198 ft through-trusses with eight panels on each side and one 120 ft through-truss with six panels on each side form {{the body of the}} bridge. The arc of the truss consists of steel beams connected to one another by [...] "batten plates" [...] (single-piece, flat, cast steel plates). The chords (the vertical and sloping beams) fit within a flange (a U-shaped, single-piece, cast steel plate) which is battened to the arc of the truss. The portal braces (the criss-crossing small beams that form a box hanging from the [...] "roof" [...] of the truss) are fastened to the truss with gusset plates. The <b>horizontal</b> <b>struts</b> at the top of each portal brace is made of [...] "laced" [...] steel (beams with holes in it), since the struts are in tension (being pulled apart) rather than compression (crushed from the ends). This allows them to be lighter and save weight.

50|$|Work on {{the dock}} began in 1846, to the designs of Rendel, with Adam Smith as {{resident}} engineer. Contractors for the dock works were Hutching, Brown and Wright. The initial main work was construction of a large cofferdam surrounding the worksite. The dam was constructed of three rows of wooden piles of Baltic yellow pine (Memel fir.), 6 and 7 ft apart, between 18 and 15 in square, piledriven until hard clay was reached. Piles were between 45 and 55 ft with some longer - the outer row was inclined to the vertical at 1 in 24. The inner space was filed with chalkstone and clay for the first 5 ft then with puddled clay. The inside of the dam was buttressed by additional rows, spaced every 25 ft of wall, of closely piled wooden piles extending back 18 ft; the intermediate space of wall was supported by <b>horizontal</b> diagonal <b>struts</b> from the inner walls to buttresses.

2500|$|Around this time, various French {{manufacturers}} like Voisin and Farman {{were hoping}} to improve the stability of aircraft against gusts by using wings that were partly flexible like those of birds and the Caudron Types M and N also included this feature. Each wing had two steel tube, wood filled spars, one {{at the leading edge}} and the other [...] aft, a little behind one third chord, with ash ribs and wire bracing. The number of ribs varied between 10, 11 and 12 and they were conventionally rigid between the spars. Behind the rear spar the upper part of each rib was also rigid, ending at about 70% chord; the lower part was completed by a thin, flexible extension strip for about 60% of the chord. The wing was then fabric covered, though the flexible portion was only covered on the upper side. The wings were supported from above by landing wires from a four-legged pylon above the fuselage and by lifting wires from another below, shorter on the Type N than on the Type M. On the latter the tip of the lower pylon was braced by a <b>horizontal,</b> longitudinal <b>strut</b> to the centre of the undercarriage frame. Lateral control was by wing warping.|$|R
