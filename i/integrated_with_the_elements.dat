40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a new approach}} to programming autonomic systems. Autonomic functions are integrated into element objects at design time using a special language called JSpoon. JSpoon extends element classes with management attributes representing configuration, performance, status and fault information. The JSpoon compiler generates respective code and interfaces to instrument the data in a common Modeler repository, provided by NESTOR [28]. JSpoon programs access and manipulate management data without distinction between "agent" and "manager" roles. JSpoon further supports integration of plug-in knowledge modules that can interpret and control element operations. These knowledge modules are used to incorporate autonomic operations with elements. This design-time approach offers several substantive advantages over current alternatives. Management is <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>element</b> development life-cycle. Instrumentation is compiler-generated and may be flexibly designed by element developers, while being consolidated into a unified global management data model.

The extraction yield can be increased by synthesizing and using novel materials with favorable distribution constants (one of the thermodynamic factors) for target analytes. The extraction yield can also be increased by improving kinetic factors, for example, by developing new extraction modes. Microextraction techniques are usually non-exhaustive processes that work under the kinetic range. In such conditions, the improvement of the extraction kinetics necessarily improves the performance.

50|$|Hall effect sensors are devices {{based on}} the Hall-effect, which was {{discovered}} by Edwin Hall in 1879 {{based on the}} physical principle of the Lorentz force. They are activated by an external magnetic field. In this generalized device, the Hall sensor senses the magnetic field produced by the magnetic system. This system responds to the quantity to be sensed (current, temperature, position, velocity, etc.) through the input interface. <b>The</b> Hall <b>element</b> is <b>the</b> basic magnetic field sensor. It requires signal conditioning to make the output usable for most applications. The signal conditioning electronics needed are an amplifier stage and temperature compensation. Voltage regulation is needed when operating from an unregulated supply. If the Hall voltage is measured when no magnetic field is present, the output should be zero. However, if voltage at each output terminal is measured with respect to ground, a non-zero voltage will appear. This is the common mode voltage (CMV), and is the same at each output terminal. The output interface then converts the electrical signal from the Hall sensor; the Hall voltage: a signal that is significant to the application context. The Hall voltage is a low level signal {{on the order of}} 30 μvolts in the presence of one gauss magnetic field. This low-level output requires an amplifier with low noise, high input impedance and moderate gain. A differential amplifier with these characteristics can be readily <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Hall <b>element</b> using standard bipolar transistor technology.

40|$|The {{process of}} {{adaptive}} bone remodeling {{can be described}} mathematically and simulated in a computer model, <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> finite <b>element</b> method. In <b>the</b> model discussed here, cortical and trabecular bone are described as a continuous material with variable mass density and hence elastic modulus. The remodeling rule applied to simulate the adaptation process in each cell individually is, in fact, an evolution law for an optimization process, relative to the external load. Its purpose is to obtain a uniform value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the mass density. The feedback mechanism in the process is self-enhancing; denser bone attracts more strain energy, whereby the bone becomes even denser. In addition, the process ensures that the discontinuous end configuration is a structure with a relatively low mass and high stiffness, inasmuch as this is an explicit objective in the optimization process. Thus, an integrated procedure of control and optimization is proposed herein in order to solve a constrained optimization problem of lightweight stiffened structures; two alternative objective functions were considered. The selection of the parameters to be optimized in the evolution rule was not yet studied in an in-depth study. The set of such parameters included the control gains, {{the target of the}} error signal and the weight of one of the two proposed cost indices.

It is shown that the discontinuous end configuration is dictated {{by the nature of}} the differential equations describing the remodeling process.

The precise solution is dependent on the parameters in the remodeling rule, the load and the initial conditions. The feedback mechanism in the process is self-enhancing, denser bone attracts more strain energy, whereby the bone becomes even more dense. It is suggested that this positive feedback of the attractor state (the strain energy field) creates order in the end configuration. In addition, the process ensures that the discontinuous end configuration is a structure with a relatively low mass, perhaps a minimal-mass structure, although this is no explicit objective in the optimization process.

40|$|The {{functional}} {{adaptation of}} bone to mechanical usage implies {{the existence of}} a physiological control process: once the structure has adapted sufficiently, the feedback signal is diminished and further changes to shape and properties are stopped. In bones it has been widely accepted that mineral tissue is resorbed in regions exposed to low mechanical stimulus, whereas new bone is deposited where the stimulus is high. This process of functional adaptation is thought to enable bone to perform its mechanical functions with a minimum of mass and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strength necessary to support mechanical loads associated with everyday activity and to protect internal organs. This premise can be expressed as a global, multi-objective optimization problem in which stiffness and mass are conflicting objectives. Maximizing stiffness is equivalent to minimizing the compliance or minimizing the strain energy in the bone. From this point of view, the bone remodelling process is analogous to topology optimization in optimal structural design The process of adaptative bone remodelling can be described analytically and simulated numerically, <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> finite <b>element</b> method. In <b>the</b> model discussed here bone tissue is described as continuous materials with variable density and with characteristics of optimal mechanical resistance and minimal mass. With a proper control strategy, this process drives the overall structure to an optimal configuration. The controllers optimized in this investigation include proportional, integral and derivative strategies. In this approach, the material distribution problem is parameterized by the elastic modulus of the discrete isotropic finite elements. A local remodelling rule iteratively updates the value of the modulus of each element individually based on the difference between a current stimulus value and a target value, relative to the external load. Its purpose is to obtain a constant, optimal value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the mass density.

40|$|Finite <b>element</b> {{equations}} representing <b>the</b> {{behavior of}} piezoelectric materials when bounded to a typical structure {{and used as}} sensors and actuators were developed. Emphasis was placed on generating sensor output equations of piezoelectric sensors and responses of a typical structure bonded with piezoelectric sensors and actuators {{on the basis of}} finite <b>element</b> formulation. <b>The</b> model can predict not only structural responses due to both mechanical and electrical loading but also electrical potential due to mechanical or thermal effects. <b>The</b> resulted finite <b>element</b> equations were then used for simple control design and performance evaluation. In the control algorithm, voltages coming out from piezoelectric sensors, which are proportional to strains at sensing locations, are taken as input. The voltages applied to the piezoelectric actuators are used as output. The feasibility of <b>integrating</b> control algorithm <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>element</b> routine developed herein and FEAP was demonstrated. In particular, optimal independent modal space control was implemented in a software package on the basis of finite element formulation. A rudimentary finite element-control algorithm package was also developed to evaluate the performance of candidate control laws. A few numerical simulations using the software package developed herein were given. The integrated software package will provide a design tool to address issues such as how adaptive smart systems will scale to a full size aircraft, the amount of piezoelectric materials and the powers needed to actuate it for desired performance. It will also provide a viable new structural control design concept for practical applications in large flexible structures such as aerospace vehicles and aircraft...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – Health is a {{fundamental}} populations’ need and {{an integral part of}} the socio-economic development of a country. However, it is required to explain the growing role of the private sectors in addressing various health care needs. The purpose of this paper is to analyse potential contribution, criticalities and conditions of success of public-private partnership (PPP) as a strategy to face the complexity of nationally relevant Italian and Indian service systems. Design/methodology/approach – The methodology is built upon the basis of the viable systems approach (VSA) <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fundamental interpretative <b>elements</b> of service science and service-dominant logic to contextualize interpretation to the management of service systems benefitting from recent advances in these research fields. Findings – A VSA-based general framework of reference is built that is useful for analysing any relational context in which different aims and expectations need to be harmonized to make the collaboration effective. On the basis of this framework, first insights on Italian and Indian health care PPPs are proposed, highlighting key elements of analysis and criticalities that may challenge a positive conclusion on health care PPPs. Practical implications – The implications of the study are both theoretical and practical. From a theoretical perspective, the study contributes to the scholarly understanding of complex health care system in Italy as well as in India with particular reference to the public-private collaboration phenomenon. It also suggests theoretical approaches in the form of a generic VSA-based framework as applicable. From a practical perspective, the study stimulates managers to a critical reflection about current health care management approaches which are reflected in the adoption of PPPs solutions. Originality/value – The paper discusses relevant worldwide decision-making challenges, such as the equality in the populations’ access to health service, suggesting managers the way to create conditions of consonance among the diverse stakeholders for a successful health care PPPs...|$|R
40|$|The {{functional}} {{adaptation of}} bone to mechanical usage implies {{the existence of}} a physiological control process: once the structure has sufficiently adapted, the feedback signal is diminished and further changes to shape and properties are stopped. In bone tissue it has been widely accepted that mineral component is resorbed in regions exposed to low mechanical stimulus, whereas new bone is deposited where the stimulus is high. This process of functional adaptation is thought to enable bone to perform its mechanical functions with a minimum of mass and <b>with</b> <b>the</b> strength necessary to support mechanical loads associated with daily activity and to protect internal organs. This premise can be expressed as a global, multi-objective optimization problem in which stiffness and mass are conflicting goals. Maximizing stiffness is equivalent to minimize the compliance or minimize the strain energy in the bone. From this point of view, the bone remodeling process is analogous to the topology optimization in structural design including the cellular automaton (CA) technique and the solid isotropic material with penalization (SIMP) approach. The process of bone remodeling can be analytically described, <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> finite <b>element</b> method and numerically simulated. With a proper control strategy, an iterative process drives the overall modelled structure to an optimal configuration. The optimized controllers in this investigation regard proportional, integral and derivative strategies. A local remodeling rule iteratively updates the value of the modulus (or relative mass) of the cellular automata, in which the structure is discretized, individually based on the difference between a current stimulus value and a target value, relative to the external load. The purpose is to obtain a constant, optimal value for the strain energy per unit bone mass, by adapting the mass density. In medical applications, a major problem threatening the long-term integrity of total hip replacement is the loss of proximal bone often found around non-cemented, press-fitted and bonded implants. The aim of this thesis is to perform a two-step procedure of control and optimization in order to solve an optimization problem of lightweight stiffened structures; various objective functions and constraints are considered so that different design requirements are compared. The selection of the optimized parameters in the evolution rules, not yet faced in an in-depth study, is successfully studied and the convergence is improved. The set of optimal parameters includes the control gains, the target of the error signal and the weight of the cost index J 1, defined as the sum of the total energy and mass of the domain of interest. Two-dimensional bone samples, subjected to an in-plane constant and linear loading, are analyzed. The bone samples are discretized in 25, 625 and 1250 cellular automata, but the proposed model is suitable to be used not only in bone mechanics but in many other fields of artificial materials discretized in whatever number of <b>elements.</b> <b>The</b> contents of the Ph. D. thesis appear as follows: in Chapter 1 the fundamental cellular mechanisms responsible for bone remodeling are briefly described; Chapter 2 contains an overview on several important bone remodeling models (optimization, phenomenological and mechanistic models) of the last forty years; Chapter 3 is made up of theoretical and numerical tools (FEM analysis, topology optimization of structures, cellular automaton model, adaptive elasticity theory and PID control) that are transferred into a unified numerical code and used for modeling bone adaptation effects. Chapter 4 includes the complete control and optimization procedure that predicts an optimal distribution of mass and energy of a bone structure under specific constraints and loading conditions. To conclude, final remarks of the proposed study are reported...|$|R
40|$|Technology scaling and {{a continual}} {{increase}} in operating frequency {{have been the}} main driver of processor performance for several decades. A recent slowdown in this evolution is compensated by multi-core architectures, which challenge application developers and also increase the disparity between the processor and memory performance. The increasing core count and growing scale of computing systems furthermore turn attention to communication as a significant contributor on application run-times. Larger systems also comprise many more components which are subject to failures. In order to mitigate {{the effects of these}} failures, fault tolerance techniques such as Checkpoint/Restart are used. These techniques often rely on message-based communication and data transport stresses the local memory interface. In order to reduce communication overhead it is desirable to either decrease the number of messages, or otherwise to accelerate the execution of commonly used global operations. Finally, power consumption of large-scale systems has become a major concern and the efficiency of such systems must considerably improve to allow future Exascale systems to operate within a reasonable power budget. This work addresses the topics memory interface, communication, fault tolerance, and energy efficiency in large-scale systems. It presents Network Attached Memory (NAM), an FPGA-based hardware prototype that can be directly connected to a common high-performance interconnection network in large-scale systems. It provides access to the emerging memory technology Hybrid Memory Cube (HMC) as shared memory resource, tightly <b>integrated</b> <b>with</b> processing <b>elements.</b> <b>The</b> first part introduces the HMC memory architecture and serial interface, and thoroughly evaluates it in an FPGA using a custom-developed host controller, which has become an open-source initiative. The next part describes the hardware architecture of the NAM design and prototype, and theoretically evaluates the expected performance and bottlenecks. The NAM design was fully prototyped in an FPGA and the contribution also comprises a corresponding software stack. As a first use case NAM serves as Checkpoint/Restart target, aiming to reduce inter-node communication and to accelerate the creation of checkpoint parity information. Reducing checkpointing overhead improves application run-times and energy efficiency likewise. The final part of this work evaluates the NAM performance in a 16 node test system. It shows a good read/write scaling behavior for an increasing number of nodes. For Checkpoint/Restart with a real application, a 2. 1 X improvement over a standard approach is a remarkable result. It proves the successful concept of a dedicated hardware component to reduce communication and fault tolerance overhead for current and future large-scale systems...|$|R
