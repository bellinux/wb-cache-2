5|$|For {{the first}} time in the history of UST, the Faculty of Pharmacy opened its doors to women in the {{academic}} year 1924–1925. It was one of the first universities in the Philippines to become co-educational when it admitted women. There were 24 women enrollees out of the 93 who matriculated for the said Faculty that school year. The University, however, had been granting certificates through the School of Midwifery since 1879. Permission was given to the College of Education in 1926, to <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> and Letters in 1927 followed by the Faculty of Medicine and Surgery and College of Commerce in 1932. The admission of women no longer became an issue in later years. Only the Faculties of Sacred Theology, Canon Law, and Philosophy remained exclusively for men.|$|E
5|$|Tzara had {{enrolled}} at the University of Bucharest in 1914, studying mathematics and philosophy, but did not graduate. In autumn 1915, he left Romania for Zürich, in neutral Switzerland. Janco, together with his brother Jules, had settled there a few months before, and was later joined by his other brother Georges. Tzara, who may have applied for the <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> at the local university, shared lodging with Marcel Janco, who {{was a student at}} the Technische Hochschule, in the Altinger Guest House (by 1918, Tzara had moved to the Limmatquai Hotel). His departure from Romania, like that of the Janco brothers, may have been in part a pacifist political statement. After settling in Switzerland, the young poet almost completely discarded Romanian as his language of expression, writing most of his subsequent works in French. The poems he had written before, which were the result of poetic dialogues between him and his friend, were left in Vinea's care. Most of these pieces were first printed only in the interwar period.|$|E

25|$|The <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> (Faculty of Liberal Arts in the {{traditional}} sense) was established {{three years after the}} Olomouc College got University rights. Englishman George Warr professed the first lecture on logics on 3 October 1576. From the beginning it was teaching the liberal arts, the Trivium (grammar, rhetoric, dialectics) which led to the Baccalaureus degree, and the Quadrivium (arithmetic, music, geometry and astronomy) which led to the Magister degree. Sharing the fate of Theological faculty in years 1618–1621, it saw a great revival with not so much the field of philosophy, but the fields of science, mathematics, physics, astronomy, cartography and finally also genetics being pursued by notable persons connected to the Faculty (however these fields are today read at the Faculty of Science). Following the Olomouc University students' participation in 1848 revolution the <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> {{was the first one to}} be suppressed by the Habsurgs in 1851.

25|$|During {{the first}} stage of its {{operation}} (1926–1950), the development focused on those Schools which were generally accepted as constituting one educational Institute, namely the <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy,</b> the Faculty of Physics and Mathematics, the Faculty of Law and Economics, the School of Theology and the Medical School. The first stage of development ended with the foundation of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine in 1950, which was the only faculty of Veterinary Medicine in Greece for many years. After this period, some of the aforementioned faculties were extended by integrating more departments. In more detail, the Departments of Pharmacy and Dentistry were founded in 1955 and 1959 respectively and they were incorporated into the Medical School. Moreover, the <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> was expanded by integrating the Institutes of Foreign Languages (English, French, German and Italian).|$|E

25|$|The Communist {{takeover}} in 1948 led {{to changes}} that would affect all Czech universities. Palacký University was hit by the persecutions, but since the university had only recently reopened, relatively few members of the Palacký academic community were affected. Nevertheless, in 1950 the Faculty of Theology was closed again, reflecting the Communist government's mistrust of the churches. The establishment in 1952 of the Olomouc School of Education (with faculties of Social Sciences and Natural Sciences) {{was followed by a}} gradual closure of the <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy</b> and Faculty of Education. Therefore, in years 1954–1958 the Palacký University had only Faculty of Medicine. The School of Education was itself closed in 1958, re-establishing once again the university's <b>Faculty</b> <b>of</b> <b>Philosophy,</b> and affiliating the Faculty of Science.
