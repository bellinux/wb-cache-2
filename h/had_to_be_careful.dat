5|$|Some early {{travellers}} found dodo meat unsavoury, {{and preferred}} to eat parrots and pigeons; others {{described it as}} tough but good. Some hunted dodos only for their gizzards, as this was considered the most delicious part of the bird. Dodos were easy to catch, but hunters <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to be bitten by their powerful beaks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} years, British {{officials}} depended on native officials for advice {{and to act}} as interpreters. However, they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> about ethnic rivalries. Thus Fadl el-Mula, a Dinka {{who had been a}} police quartermaster, greatly impressed the Governor of Mongalla and was appointed assistant superintendent of the Twic Dinka in 1909. He was credited with keeping the peace between the Dinka and the Nuer people, two groups with a history of fighting and cattle raiding. However, Fadl el-Mula was so strongly biased towards the Dinka that his police were attacked by angry Nuer and he had to be removed from his post.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} {{of support for}} rugby grew over the following years, and large paying crowds were attracted to major matches, particular in Yorkshire, where matches in the Yorkshire Cup (T'owd Tin Pot) soon became major events. England teams of the era were dominated by Lancashire and Yorkshire players. However these players were forbidden to earn any of the spoils of this newly-rich game. Predominantly working class teams {{found it difficult to}} play to their full potential because in many cases their time to play and to train was limited by the need to earn a wage. A further limit on the playing ability of working class teams was that working class players <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> how hard they played. If injured, they had to pay their own medical bills and possibly take time off work, which for a man earning a weekly wage could easily lead to financial hardship.|$|E

25|$|By {{design the}} trireme {{was meant for}} day-long journeys, with no {{capacity}} to stay at sea overnight or carry the necessary provisions to sustain the men it carried. There were, however, storage facilities on board large enough to provide each crewman with the 2 gallons (7.6 L) of fresh drinking water {{he would need to}} stay hydrated each day. This meant that all those aboard were dependent upon the land and peoples of where they landed each night for supplies. Sometimes this would entail traveling up to eighty kilometres in order to procure the necessary provisions. In the Peloponnesian War, the beached Athenian fleet was caught unawares on more than one occasion, while out looking for food (Battle of Syracuse and Battle of Aegospotami). The cities, which suddenly found themselves needing to provide for all these sailors were usually agreeable and did not mind the extra business, but those in charge of the fleet and/or mission <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to completely deplete the 'host' city of resources.|$|E
25|$|At least sixteen pretenders during Catherine's reign {{claimed that}} they were the deposed tsar, Peter III. A less common {{position}} pretenders claimed during Catherine's reign was that of Ivan VI. Ivan VI was a potential threat to Catherine since he was exiled as an infant and could lay claim to the throne. Peter III was the more popular option for pretenders since there existed legends that he was not actually dead, allowing pretenders to convince discontented Russians they were Peter III. Peter III was also popular among Russians because of his benevolent rule. Pretenders claiming to be Peter III used his popularity among Russians to gain support. Pretenders <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> to establish themselves as the ruler they claimed to be without being recognised as a normal mortal and not of royal blood. One popular way to prevent recognition was to claim their right to royalty far from their home as both Emal'Ian Ivanovich Pugachev and the pretender Artem'ev did. Pretenders also had to account for where they had disappeared to for the time since their reported deaths. For example, Pugachev claimed that he spent the eleven years since Peter III's reported death wandering abroad as far as Egypt or Constantinople.|$|E

50|$|There {{are also}} {{stationary}} rocks that the player must avoid. The rocks are randomly {{distributed throughout the}} maze, increasing in number as the game progresses.

500|$|When {{handing out}} scripts {{for the attack}} on the beach, Bender told the crew he and others [...] "wanted this to be really big and really dramatic". They used arrows on wires to {{simulate}} hitting the fleeing victims, which included Neil Frogurt (Sean Whalen). A stunt double, Kim Koscki, was hired for the scene to stand in for Whalen; he applied anti-burn cream over his face and body for protection, and crew members waited nearby to quickly extinguish the flames once a scene was finished shooting. Due to the abundance of wires, the actors <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> when running, or risk tripping over them.|$|E
500|$|According to Lionel Steketee, [...] "Mylène [...] very professional, thorough, {{discreet}} {{and almost}} shy" [...] when she {{participated in the}} shooting of the video. He said she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to get scratched by the cat, and that the final scene was difficult to film because the cats were afraid of the water used in this scene, the rats remained hidden {{in a corner and}} the birds did not fly much. Given that the song deals with the pain caused by the absence of a dead person, the video is unrelated to the lyrics, as noted by author Alice Novak. In reviews, Yahoo! Music said that, through the video, [...] " [...] invites us into her dark and magical universe", and Premiere deemed it [...] "mysterious, provocative".

The scenes were shot in the old nave of the church, which was surrounded by [...] "rough-hewn sandstone and glowing stained glass windows." [...] Liz Guiver, the former vicar's secretary and administrator, revealed that many of the church's parishioners were excited at the prospect of seeing the actors on set. Speaking to Guy Blackman from The Age, Guiver recalled [...] "The person who played the vicar, and wore the vicar's robe, he smoked cigarettes, so we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> that they were dry-cleaned before services on Sunday. Then we waited for months until the episode was aired, and most parishioners were glued to the set." [...] Scenes featuring the character's family homes and Ramsay Street were shot at the show's studio in Forest Hill and at Pin Oak Court in Vermont South respectively. Recalling the shoot, Donovan told the Herald Suns Nui Te Koha, [...] "I don't remember that particular day well, but when you do set ups like weddings it takes a long, long time to put things together." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Hungry Earth" [...] and [...] "Cold Blood" [...] made up {{the fourth}} {{production}} block of the series and were filmed in late October and November 2009 in the Upper Boat Studios and Llanwynno, Wales. [...] "Cold Blood" [...] utilised many different locations and unusual sets to portray the Silurian city, as the production team did not want simply a [...] "cave feel". They believed that the Silurians were also sophisticated {{and were able to}} use materials found underground, such as granite and marble. Many of the sets were given an orange glow from beneath to portray the [...] "ambient glow" [...] from the centre of the earth. The jungle walkway leading to the Silurian city was filmed in the Plantasia botanical garden in Swansea on 13 November 2009. The set gave a sense of things growing, as these were necessary for the Silurians to survive. Set designers were able to rearrange the plants, though they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> not to show the window leading to the car park or other modern amenities. The hall where the Doctor is brought for execution was filmed at the Temple of Peace in Cardiff, and little dressing was done to the set.|$|E
500|$|The {{producers}} were diligent {{in ensuring}} the boys' security. O'Mahoney explained: [...] "They were under very strict security rules {{when they were}} filming. They were told not to act as news cameramen. They {{were not allowed to}} film in the street. They could only film at school or at home, in secure environments." [...] Winter added, [...] "they are not paid news cameramen, and that was not the point of the film. Would they normally be running down the street toward a firefight to film it? No. Would they run toward a bombing, knowing {{that there could be a}} secondary explosion or a group of soldiers, who could start, at any second, firing wildly into the crowd, to film a piece of video? No. That's not real life for any Iraqi civilian." [...] Nevertheless, Hayder sometimes filmed outside at night, and explained to the camera that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>careful</b> because people are robbed if they are seen carrying even a mobile phone. On New Year's Eve, he and his friend celebrate with a bonfire in his friend's back yard, but after debating whether a noise they hear is fireworks or gunfire, Hayder rushes home. Another boy is driven to school one morning, and reach a special forces roadside checkpoint along the way. He explains, [...] "if they see me with a camera they will take me to prison; they'll think I'm a terrorist who wants to bomb them." ...|$|E

[...] Two navy sailors were assigned to him to monitor and supervise him to prevent injuries, which were still unavoidable. [...] They also carried him around when he was unable to walk. As well as being a source of constant torment to his parents, the recurring episodes of illness and long recoveries interfered greatly with Alexei's education.|$|E

Sahagún taught Latin and other subjects during its initial years. Other friars taught grammar, history, religion, scripture, and philosophy. Native leaders were recruited to teach about native history and traditions, leading to controversy among colonial officials who were concerned with controlling the indigenous populations.
