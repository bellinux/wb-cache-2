5|$|Matejko {{began work}} on the {{painting}} {{in the middle of}} January 1891, to coincide with the centenary of the Constitution. Although the painting was not finished until October, by May 3 it was sufficiently advanced to be shown at the anniversary exhibition in Sukiennice, Kraków. On April 7, 1892, Matejko transferred the painting to Prince Eustachy Stanisław Sanguszko, marshal of <b>Galician</b> Sejm in Lwów, and it was displayed in the Sejm building (now the main building of the Lviv University). This painting {{was one of the last}} works by Matejko, who died in November 1893.|$|E
5|$|Speakers in the European Parliament are {{entitled}} to speak {{in any of the}} 24 official languages of the European Union, ranging from French and German to Maltese and Irish. Simultaneous interpreting is offered in all plenary sessions, and all final texts of legislation are translated.

5|$|In {{making his}} {{terrestrial}} globes, Molyneux examined ruttiers (instructions for directions at sea) and pilots (navigational handbooks). He {{is known to}} have given a ruttier for Brazil and the West Indies to Thomas Harriot in 1590. He also received advice and assistance from navigators and mathematicians. It is likely, for instance, that Sir Walter Raleigh advised him on a legend in Spanish about the Solomon Islands that appeared on the terrestrial globe. Raleigh came by the information from Pedro Sarmiento de Gamboa, a <b>Galician</b> explorer sent by King Philip II of Spain to fortify the Strait of Magellan after Francis Drake had passed through it. In 1584, the Spaniard was Raleigh's guest in London for a few weeks, after being captured by Raleigh on a journey to Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{the last}} 16, the club faced top-flight club Celta de Vigo, and {{began with a}} 42 away win at the <b>Galician</b> club's Balaídos on 6 January 2015. Defender Mikel San José headed Athletic into an early lead, only for Álex López to equalise for the hosts six minutes later, and Aritz Aduriz to restore the visitors' lead four minutes after that. In the second half, Charles made it level again, but a Markel Susaeta goal and a late penalty from Aduriz gave Athletic the win. Celta won the second leg 20 via a Xabier Etxeita own goal and a Fabián Orellana contribution, but Athletic {{advanced}} on the away goals rule.|$|E
5|$|The {{methods for}} {{creating}} poetic rhythm vary across languages and between poetic traditions. Languages are {{often described as}} having timing set primarily by accents, syllables, or moras, depending on how rhythm is established, though a language can be influenced by multiple approaches. Japanese is a mora-timed language. Syllable-timed languages include Latin, Catalan, French, Leonese, <b>Galician</b> and Spanish. English, Russian and, generally, German are stress-timed languages. Varying intonation also affects how rhythm is perceived. Languages can rely on either pitch, such as in Vedic Sanskrit or Ancient Greek, or tone. Tonal languages include Chinese, Vietnamese and most Subsaharan languages.|$|E
25|$|The ethnonym Ruthenians for Ukrainian {{people had}} been {{accepted}} by both the Russophiles and the Moscophiles {{for quite a long}} period of time. The new name Ukrainians began to be accepted by the Ruthenian <b>Galicians</b> (as opposed to Polonian <b>Galicians)</b> around the 1890s, under the influence of Mykola Kostomarov and the Brotherhood of Saints Cyril and Methodius in central Ukraine.|$|R
50|$|The {{second most}} common Spanish region with the largest numbers were the <b>Galicians</b> and Asturians, and the third regions were Canary Islanders, Basques and Andalusians.

There were regions of the island that attracted some immigrants more than others which was mainly for political or economic reasons.|$|R

5|$|The {{restoration}} {{of relations with}} Galicia had an immediate benefit for Manuel when, in 1166, he dispatched two armies to attack the eastern provinces of Hungary in a vast pincer movement. One army crossed the Walachian Plain and entered Hungary through the Transylvanian Alps (Southern Carpathians), while the other army made a wide circuit to Galicia and, with <b>Galician</b> aid, crossed the Carpathian Mountains. Since the Hungarians had most of their forces concentrated on the Sirmium and Belgrade frontier, they were caught off guard by the Byzantine invasion; this resulted in the Hungarian province of Transylvania being thoroughly ravaged by the Byzantine armies.|$|E

5|$|After the Austrian {{invasion}} of the Duchy of Warsaw, Russia, bound by the treaty of alliance with France, reluctantly entered the war against Austria. The Russian army {{under the command of}} General Sergei Golitsyn crossed into Galicia on 3 June 1809. Golitsyin advanced as slowly as possible, with instructions to avoid any major confrontation with the Austrians. There were only minor skirmishes between the Russian and Austrian troops, with minimal losses. The Austrian and Russian commanders were in frequent correspondence and, in fact, shared some operational intelligence. A courteous letter sent by a Russian divisional commander, General Andrey Gorchakov, to Archduke Ferdinand was intercepted by the Poles, who sent an original to Emperor Napoleon and a copy to Tsar Alexander. As a result, Alexander had to remove Gorchakov from command. Furthermore, there were constant disagreements between Golitsyn and Poniatowski, with whom the Russians were supposed to cooperate in Galicia. As a result of the Treaty of Schönbrunn, Russia received the <b>Galician</b> district of Tarnopol.|$|E
50|$|Related to {{linguistic}} claims, the <b>Galicians</b> (and to {{a lesser}} extent, the Asturians) claim a strong Celtic heritage. Though the Celts once inhabited virtually all of Iberia, they lasted longest in the isolated northwest. Though the <b>Galicians</b> speak a Romance language, they nonetheless retained many traditional symbols associated with the Celts, including Celtic architecture and art, dress, and especially Celtic music (albeit with non-Celtic words).|$|R

5|$|Mendes de Vasconcelos, {{encouraged}} by his successes, promised the Portuguese Queen Regent Luisa de Guzmán {{that he would}} capture the town of Badajoz, headquarters of the Spanish Army of Extremadura and therefore the most important Spanish fortress near the Portuguese frontier. The Count of Sabugal suggested that an offensive in the north, to conquer the <b>Galician</b> city of Tui, would be easier, due to the mild climate of the coast, and suggested that this would also be strategically more beneficial as it would secure the province of Entre Douro e Minho. But the queen and her ministers preferred Mendes de Vasconcelos' plan. He was given command of an army consisting of 14,000 infantry and 3,000 cavalry troops with a train of 20 cannons and 2 mortars, gathered in the main fortress of Elvas. Mendes de Vasconcelos' second-in-command was the recently appointed Maestro de Campo General dom Rodrigo de Castro, {{a friend of the}} Count of Soure, Vasconcelos' enemy in the court, which was a cause of friction between them.|$|E
5|$|Raúl Alfonsín {{was born}} on 12 March 1927, {{in the city of}} Chascomús, 123km (76mi) south of Buenos Aires. His parents were Serafín Raúl Alfonsín Ochoa and Ana María Foulkes. His father was of <b>Galician</b> and German descent, and his mother was the {{daughter}} of Welsh immigrant Ricardo Foulkes and Falkland Islander María Elena Ford. Following his elementary schooling, Raúl Alfonsín enrolled at the General San Martín Military Lyceum, graduating after five years as a second lieutenant. He did not pursue a military career, and began studying law instead. He began his studies at the National University of La Plata, and completed them at the University of Buenos Aires, graduating at the age of 23. He married María Lorenza Barreneche, whom he met in the 1940s at a masquerade ball, in 1949. They moved to Mendoza, La Plata, and returned to Chascomús. They had six sons, of whom only Ricardo Alfonsín would also follow a political career.|$|E
5|$|Sikorski {{attended}} the gimnazjum in Rzeszów (now Konarski's High School in Rzeszów) from 1893 to 1897, then transferred {{for a year}} to a Rzeszów teachers' college. In 1899 he {{attended the}} Lwów Franciszek Józef Gymnasium, and in 1902 he passed his final high school exam there. Starting that year, young Sikorski studied engineering at the Lwów Polytechnic, specializing in road and bridge construction, and graduated in 1908 with a diploma in hydraulic engineering. In 1906 Sikorski volunteered for a year's service in the Austro-Hungarian army and attended the Austrian Military School, obtaining an officer's diploma and becoming an army reserve second lieutenant (podporucznik rezerwy). In 1909 he married Helena Zubczewska, whom he met while {{at the high school}} in Lwów. In 1912 they had a daughter, Zofia. After graduation he lived in Leżajsk and worked for the <b>Galician</b> administration's hydraulic engineering department, working on the regulation of the San river, and later was involved in private enterprises related to construction, real estate and petroleum trade.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the death}} of Yaroslav Osmomysl on 1 October 1187, trouble began in the Principality of Halych, due to the strife between his two sons, Oleg and Vladimir Yaroslavich. Roman urged the <b>Galicians</b> to evict Vladimir Yaroslavich and make him their prince. But they failed either to expel Vladimir Yaroslavich or to kill him. When, however, the <b>Galicians</b> {{threatened}} to kill his wife, Vladimir Yaroslavich took her and fled to King Béla III of Hungary (1172–1196). According to a late chronicle, Oleg Yaroslavich was appointed by Duke Casimir II of Poland (1177–1194) to rule in Halych, but the <b>Galicians</b> poisoned him and invited Roman to be their prince. When accepting their offer, Roman gave his patrimony of Vladimir-in-Volhynia to his brother, Vsevolod Mstislavich.|$|R
25|$|Second, {{neighboring}} rebellions by Basques and <b>Galicians</b> failed, aborted by Asturian kings. The rebellions, in turn, {{took advantage}} of the internal rebellions of the central and Eastern part of Asturias, and, on occasions, provided help to one or another contender of the Asturian aristocracy: refuge to Alphonse II in lands of Alava, after his flight; the support to Nepociano's rebellion in some Asturian areas or the adherence of <b>Galicians</b> to the cause of Ramiro I.|$|R
5|$|With {{his goal}} tally nearly {{reaching}} 40 goals after spending two full seasons in Sporting's main team, Villa got his chance in Spain's top-flight when Sporting were in financial difficulty – newly promoted Real Zaragoza signed him for approximately €3million {{in the summer}} of 2003. The striker had no trouble adapting to playing at the higher level, netting 17 times in his first season at Zaragoza. His league debut came during Zaragoza's first La Liga game since his arrival, where the team were defeated 1–0 away by <b>Galician</b> side Deportivo de La Coruña while his first goal came two games later, an eighth-minute goal against Real Murcia which put Zaragoza 2–0 up in a match which ended 3–0. 4 December 2003 saw him net his first brace (two goals) in a 2–2 draw against Athletic Bilbao and on 25 April 2004, he scored his first hat-trick in a tight 4–4 draw against Sevilla which saw Villa score all four of Zaragoza's goals, putting his team ahead on two occasions.|$|E
