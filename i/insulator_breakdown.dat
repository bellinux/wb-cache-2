40|$|Post {{insulators}} as {{the weakest}} component of transmission lines, are highly exposed to <b>breakdown.</b> <b>Insulators</b> <b>breakdown</b> leads to outage and economic loss for transmission companies. Faulted post insulator detection and location {{is very important}} to minimum duration of outage. Depending on type of post insulators types, they can be detected in case of breakdown. Silicon rubber post insulators as new generation of insulators, have better insulation characteristics compare to others. Away from all of its advantages, detection and location of broken ones are difficult for system operator due to no external damage. In this thesis design of a self-powered system to detect the broken silicon rubber post insulator has been pursued.

40|$|High-voltage vacuum {{insulator}} {{failure is}} generally due to surface flashover rather than <b>insulator</b> bulk <b>breakdown.</b> Vacuum surface flashover {{is widely believed}} to be initiated by a secondary electron emission avalanche along the vacuum-insulator interface. This process requires a physical mechanism to cause secondary electrons emitted from the insulator surface to return to that surface. Here, we show that when an insulator is subjected to a fast high-voltage pulse, the magnetic field due to displacement current through the insulator can provide this mechanism. This indicates {{the importance of the}} voltage pulse shape, especially the rise time, in the flashover initiation process...|$|R
40|$|The {{potential}} of a new cable diagnostic known as Pulse-Arrested Spark Discharge technique (PASD) is being studied. Previous reports have documented the capability of the technique to locate cable failures using a short high voltage pulse. This report will investigate the impact of PASD on the sample under test. In this report, two different energy deposition experiments are discussed. These experiments include the PASD pulse ({approx} 6 mJ) and a high energy discharge ({approx} 600 mJ) produced from a charged capacitor source. The high energy experiment is used to inflict detectable damage upon the insulators and to make comparisons {{with the effects of}} the low energy PASD pulse. <b>Insulator</b> <b>breakdown</b> voltage strength before and after application of the PASD pulse and high energy discharges are compared. Results indicate that the PASD technique does not appear to degrade the breakdown strength of the insulator or to produce visible damage. However, testing of the additional materials, including connector insulators, may be warranted to verify PASDs non-destructive nature across the full spectrum of insulators used in commercial aircraft wiring systems...|$|E
40|$|High voltage (HV) {{insulators}} {{are critical}} components in high-energy, accelerator and pulsed power systems that drive diverse {{applications in the}} national security, nuclear weapons science, defense and industrial arenas. In these systems, the insulator may separate vacuum/non-vacuum regions or conductors with high electrical field gradients. These insulators will often fail at electric fields over {{an order of magnitude}} lower than their intrinsic dielectric strength due to flashover at the dielectric interface. Decades of studies have produced a wealth of information on fundamental processes and mechanisms important for flashover initiation, but only for relatively simple insulator configurations in controlled environments. Accelerator and pulsed power system designers are faced with applying the fundamental knowledge to complex, operational devices with escalating HV requirements. Designers are forced to rely on “best practices” and expensive prototype testing, providing boundaries for successful operation. However, the safety margin is difficult to estimate, and system design must be very conservative for situations where testing is not practicable, or replacement of failed parts is disruptive or expensive. The Phase I program demonstrated the feasibility of developing an advanced code for modeling <b>insulator</b> <b>breakdown.</b> Such a code would be of great interest for a number of applications, including high energy physics, microwave source development, fusion sciences, and other research and industrial applications using high voltage devices...|$|E

The tunnelling current of irradiated capacitors is observed to be enhanced in the low gate voltage range, a behaviour quite similar to the increased leakage current observed in electrically stressed devices. On the other hand, {{the slopes of the}} time-to-breakdown distributions decrease after x-ray irradiation, indicating that the critical density of traps needed to trigger breakdown in the gate oxide is lower in irradiated capacitors. in addition, the probability of observing soft breakdown of the SiO 2 layer increases after the irradiation.

40|$|Gas {{insulated}} substations (GIS) {{have received}} {{great interest in}} the recent years. One {{of the advantages of}} GIS over conventional substations is their compactness which makes them a favourite for service in urban residential areas. These consists conductors supported on insulator inside on enclosure filled with sulphur hexafluoride (SF 6) gas. The voltage withstands capability of SF 6 bus duct is strongly dependent on field perturbations such as those caused by conductor surface imperfections and by conducting particle contaminants. These acquire charge due to the electric field intensity. Nearly 50 % of GIS failures are due to metallic conducting particles lifted by electric field and migrate to conductor or <b>insulator</b> initiating <b>breakdown</b> at voltages significantly below the insulation characteristics.

Fulgurites are homologous to Lichtenberg figures, which are the branching patterns produced on surfaces of <b>insulators</b> during dielectric <b>breakdown</b> by high-voltage discharges, such as lightning.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate temperature and time dependent models for the electrostatic breakdown of polymeric spacecraft <b>insulators.</b> Temperature dependent <b>breakdown</b> was found by inducing an electrostatic breakdown in the prototypical polymer Low Density Polyethylene (LDPE) at various temperatures. Time dependent breakdown was found by applying a static voltage to LDPE and measuring the time to electrostatic breakdown. No significant temperature dependence of the electrostatic breakdown of LDPE was observed in a temperature range of 150 K to 300 K. The time dependent results show that the time to electrostatic breakdown is modeled by a negative logarithmic decay consistent with thermodynamic mean field multiple trapping models, with the electric field breakdown strength asymptotically approaching a constant value as the time to breakdown goes to infinity...|$|R
40|$|A {{low-energy}} gallium {{plasma source}} {{is used to}} perform a spatially and temporally broad spectroscopic survey in the 220 - 520 nm range. Neutral, singly, and doubly ionized gallium are present in a 20 J, 1. 8 kA (peak) arc discharge operating with a central cathode. When the polarity of the inner electrode is reversed the discharge current and arc voltage waveforms remain similar. Utilizing a central anode configuration, multiple Ga lines are absent in the 270 - 340 nm range. In addition, neutral and singly ionized Fe spectral lines are present, indicating erosion of the outer electrode. With graphite present on the <b>insulator</b> to facilitate <b>breakdown,</b> line emission from the gallium species is further reduced and while emissions from singly and doubly ionized carbon atoms and molecular carbon (C 2) radicals are observed.

40|$|This thesis work {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} {{the application of the}} PAMBE-SAG technique to fabrication of high-power GaN-based switching HEMTs. First, a detailed study of the efficacy of SAG was conducted by comparing it with ion-implantation, a popular technique for improving Ohmic contacts. A consistent improvement in device performance by SAG was achieved, including lower contact resistance, higher peak drain currents and higher breakdown voltages. Since the results indicated that SAG is effective in fabricating HEMTs for high power applications, it was then employed to fabricate large-periphery AlGaN/GaN HEMTs for high current operation. A high saturation current of 1. 75 A and low on-state resistance of 4. 76 mΩ cm 2 for a total gate width of 5. 2 mm were achieved. Finally, a study on enhancement of the breakdown voltage was conducted. For the first time, the use of sputtered-SiO 2 as the gate insulator was investigated. Good oxide film quality was confirmed by a low leakage current of 2. 76 x 10 - 6 A/mm and a high gate breakdown voltage of 250 V. A dual-SiO 2 -deposition method which incorporates both PECVD-SiO 2 and sputtered-SiO 2 was then proposed {{to solve the problem of}} reduction in current caused by sputtering. The MOSHEMT fabricated using this method showed more than twofold increase in the current when compared with a regular HEMT without oxide insulation. A high breakdown voltage of 620 V at 6 µm gate-to-drain distance was also achieved, demonstrating that the oxide film made by our dual-SiO 2 -deposition approach is a more effective gate <b>insulator</b> for <b>breakdown</b> voltage enhancement than many techniques previously reported...|$|R
5000|$|An {{electrical}} insulator serves to provide physical separation of conducting parts, and under normal operating conditions is continuously {{subject to a}} high electric field which occupies the air surrounding the equipment. Overvoltage events may cause the electric field to exceed the dielectric strength of air and result {{in the formation of}} an arc between the conducting parts and over the surface of the insulator. [...] This is called flashover. Contamination of the surface of the <b>insulator</b> reduces the <b>breakdown</b> strength and increases the tendency to flash over. On an electrical transmission system, protective relays are expected to detect the formation of the arc and automatically open circuit breakers to discharge the circuit and extinguish the arc. Under a worst case, this process may take as long as several seconds, during which time the insulator surface would be in close contact with the highly energetic plasma of the arc. This is very damaging to an insulator, and may shatter brittle glass or ceramic disks, resulting in its complete failure.|$|R

[Liebault, J., Vallayer, J., Goeuriot, D., Tréheux D., Thévenot, F., How the trapping of charges can explain the dielectrics breakdown performance of alumina ceramics, J. Eur. Ceram. Soc., 2001, 21, 389 – 397; Si Ahmed, A., Kansy, J., Zarbout, K., Moya, G., Liebault, J., Goeuriot, D., Microstructural origin of the dielectric breakdown strength in alumina: a study by positron lifetime spectroscopy, J. Eur. Ceram. Soc., 2005, 25, 2813 – 2816]. The experimental study of these materials behaviour towards charge injection was performed by the scanning electron microscopy mirror effect (SEMME) method. It allows to measure the amount of injected charges finally trapped in the insulator. In order to explain the experimental results, we developed an iterative computer simulation of the self-consistent charge transport in bulk alumina samples during electron beam irradiation, based on a new flight-drift model (FDM). Ballistic and drift electron and hole transport as well as their recombination, trapping and detrapping (due to temperature and electric field) are taken into account. As a main result the time dependent secondary electron emission rate and the spatial distributions of currents, charges, field and potential are obtained. The analysis of these two kinds of results allowed us to identify the effect of the microstructure on the behaviour of the injected charges in the insulator and then to propose some mechanisms depending on the temperature leading to a good dielectric breakdown resistance. Indeed, at room temperature a huge localisation of charges limits further injection into the sample that permits to delay breakdown. On the other hand, when the temperature increases, the efficiency of the charge spreading behaviour is improved, leading to a higher dielectric breakdown strength...|$|R

The merits of using gallium in an electromagnetic thruster (EMT) are discussed and estimates of discharge current levels and mass flow rates yielding efficient operation are given. The gallium atomic weight of 70 predicts high efficiency in the 1500 - 2000 s specific impulse range, making it ideal for higher-thrust, near-Earth missions. A spatially and temporally broad spectroscopic survey in the 220 - 520 nm range is used to determine which species {{are present in the}} plasma and estimate electron temperature. The spectra show that neutral, singly, and doubly ionized gallium species are present in a 20 J, 1. 8 kA (peak) are discharge. With graphite present on the <b>insulator</b> to facilitate <b>breakdown,</b> singly and doubly ionized carbon atoms are also present, and emission is observed from molecular carbon (CZ) radicals.

Outside the safe parametric region, local maximum of electric field strength around the stress cone appears in the termination <b>insulator,</b> enhancing the <b>breakdown</b> of the cable termination. In the presence of the temperature gradient, thermal activation energy and nonlinearity-relevant coefficient work as complementary factors to produce a reasonable electric field distribution. The field maximum in the termination insulator show complicate variation in the transient processes.

40|$|Polymeric {{aircraft}} electrical insulation normally degrades by partial discharge with increasing voltage, which causes excessive localized Joule heating {{in the material}} and ultimately leads to dielectric failure of the <b>insulator</b> through thermal <b>breakdown.</b> Developing self-healing insulation could be a viable option to mitigate permanent mechanical degradation, thus increasing the longevity of the insulation. Instead of relying on catalyst and monomer-filled microcapsules to crack, flow, and cure at the damaged sites described in well-published mechanisms, establishment of ionic crosslinks could allow for multiple healing events to occur with {{the added benefit of}} achieving full recovery strength under certain thermal environments. This could be possible if the operating temperature of the insulator is the same as or close to the temperature where ionic crosslinks are formed. Surlyn, a commercial material with ionic crosslinks, was investigated as a candidate self-healing insulator based off prior demonstrations of self-healing behavior. Thin films of varying thicknesses were investigated and the effects of thickness on the dielectric strength were evaluated and compared to representative polymer insulators. The effects of thermal conditioning on the recovery strength and healing were observed as a function of time following dielectric breakdown.
