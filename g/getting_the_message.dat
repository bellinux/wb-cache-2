Each of the rebels is given a bar of gold {{and the rest is}} buried as they wait for the transport to arrive. The convoy goes to the Iranian border, where the three Americans intend to escort the rebels across to protect them from the Iraqi soldiers guarding the crossing. But the American officers arrive and stop the group, arresting the trio while the rebels are recaptured. Archie proffers the buried gold to the American officers in exchange for letting the refugees through. The commanding officer acquiesces to assisting the rebels get into Iran, but still states that charges (of being absent without leave and disobeying orders by contradicting American post-war policy) and courts-martial will be convened against Archie, Troy, and Chief Elgin.|$|E

At the same time, Belle catches up and surprises Gold who then comes clean about still being the Dark One and his reacquired powers, as well as her pregnancy, but then he tells Belle that she will have to choose whether or not she wants to be with him and that he will never change. Robin, Regina and Zelena catch up with Belle and return the baby to Zelena so she can feed her. However, Zelena was about deceive {{everyone}} by escaping with her daughter, only to have a change of heart and returning her baby, upon learning that her magic isn’t powerful enough in the Underworld to protect the baby by herself, having suspected that Hades brought her to the Underworld so that he can use her daughter to enact a time-travel spell. Meanwhile at the loft, everyone starts to believe that Zelena, even without her powers, can help them. Henry also shows them more drawings, including the story of baby Neal hearing his parents, indicating that Snow and David succeeded in <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> to their son.|$|E

2500|$|Using English {{words in}} daily conversation, advertising, and {{entertainment}} {{is seen as}} trendy and cool. However this use can often lead to misunderstandings due to problems with pronunciation, grammar or vocabulary. Modern use of Konglish has already created a linguistic divide between North Korea and South Korea. North Korean defectors can have trouble integrating into South Korean society {{because much of the}} Konglish used there is not used in North Korea. This can lead to confusion, misunderstandings and delay integration into the society. This is not the sole cause of the linguistic divide between the two nations as some Korean words are also used differently between the two countries. While Konglish problems exist between the North and South they also exist between the metropolitan and rural. Ahn Jung-hyo a Korean-English translator who is the author of [...] "A False English Dictionary" [...] was noted for saying that improper use of Konglish in other countries is likely to bring shame to Korea. However, John Huer, a columnist for Korea Times, noted Konglish usage as one of his [...] "10 Most Wonderful Things About Korea". He felt that it was both inventive and clever. After that article Huer criticized Koreans for their bad English and improper use of loanwords, though. Modern Konglish usage could even be viewed as art, yet {{there is a difference between}} a cultural use of a word like [...] "Fighting!" [...] and the bad grammar and vocabulary seen on signs, packages, and TV around Korea. Sebastian Harrisan has suggested that calling these kinds of things Konglish masks the problem with English education in Korea. The Korean government has been criticized by civic groups for their use of Konglish in slogans and focusing too much on English education. They feel that the heavy focus on English will damage the Korean language and doesn't benefit international competitiveness. In contrast, Jasper Kim, a law professor at Ewha Womans University, wrote that Konglish is necessary in a global context and that strict adherence to grammatical rules shouldn't trump <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> across.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Many ad hoc routing {{protocols}} {{are based on}} (some variant of) flooding. Despite various optimizations, many routing messages are propagated unnecessarily. We propose a gossiping-based approach, where each node forwards a message with some probability, to reduce the overhead of the {{routing protocols}}. Gossiping exhibits bimodal behavior in sufficiently large networks: in some executions, the gossip dies out quickly and hardly any node <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> message; in the remaining executions, a substantial fraction of <b>the</b> nodes <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>message.</b> <b>The</b> fraction of executions in which most nodes <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> depends on <b>the</b> gossiping probability and the topology of the network. In the networks we have considered, using gossiping probability between 0. 6 and 0. 8 suffices to ensure that almost every node <b>gets</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> in almost every execution. For large networks, this simple gossiping protocol uses up to 35 % fewer messages than flooding, with improved performance. Gossiping can also be combined with various optimizations of flooding to yield further benefits. Simulations show that adding gossiping to AODV results in significant performance improvement, even in networks as small as 150 nodes. We expect that the improvement should be even more significant in larger networks. I...|$|R
