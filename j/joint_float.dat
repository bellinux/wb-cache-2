40|$|This paper {{analyses}} policy interdependence under flexible {{exchange rates}} {{and its implications for}} middle-income countries in the Pacific area. In {{the first part of the}} paper, the consequences of strategic behavior among industrial countries are illustrated by means of a simple diagram. It is argued that in the absence of incentives to coordinate macroeconomic policies among major countries, exchange rates will tend to be volatile. Evidence on the world value of the dollar in the flexible rate period is then presented and interpreted. The second part describes exchange rate policies in the Pacific area. It is found that the widespread policy of pegging to the U. S. dollar has implied occasional large devaluations against the numeraire (Korea, Taiwan, Thailand, Philippines and Indonesia). An alternative, which requires higher Pacific trade and financial interdependence than the one prevailing during the last decade, would be a <b>joint</b> <b>float</b> along the lines of the policies seemingly pursued by Malaysia and Singapore. The two-country macroeconomic model presented in the Appendix can be used to assess the costs and benefits of policy coordination both at the world and at the regional level. ...|$|E

500|$|Various {{systems are}} under {{development}} at present aimed at harnessing the enormous potential available for wave power off Scotland's coasts. Pelamis Wave Power (previously Ocean Power Delivery) are an Edinburgh-based company whose Pelamis {{system has been}} tested off Orkney and Portugal. Their second generation P2 Pelamis machines are [...] long and [...] diameter. Five tubes joined together by hinged <b>joints</b> <b>float</b> semi-submerged {{on the surface of}} the ocean and move relative to each other as waves pass down the length of the machine. This motion is resisted by hydraulic cylinders which drive generators inside the machine to produce electricity. Future wave farm projects around Scotland could involve an arrangement of interlinked 1 MW machines connected to shore by a subsea transmission cable.|$|R

40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{incidence}} of secondary wrist injury among manual wheelchair users, recent emphasis has been placed on the investigation of wheelchair propulsion biomechanics. Accurate representation of wrist activity during wheelchair propulsion may help to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to the development of wrist injuries. Unfortunately, no consensual wrist biomechanical model has been established. In order to determine if different methodologies obtain similar results, this investigation created and compared three different wrist models: 1) a fixed joint center placed between the styloids (midstyloid joint center); 2) a joint center with 2 ° of freedom computed from de Leva's joint center data; and 3) a <b>floating</b> <b>joint</b> center. Results indicate that wrist flexion and extension angles are highly consistent between models, however, radial and ulnar deviation angles vary considerably. Mean maximum right flexion angles were found to be 3. 5 °, 2. 2 °, and 5. 0 ° for the midstyloid, de Leva, and <b>floating</b> <b>joint</b> center models, respectively. Extension angles were 22. 3 °, 23. 6 °, and 23. 6 °, respectively. Mean maximum right radial deviation angles for the midstyloid, de Leva, and <b>floating</b> <b>joint</b> center models were 26. 0 °, 26. 9 °, and 45. 1 °, respectively, and ulnar deviation angles were found to be 30. 5 °, 38. 8 °, and 10. 2 °, respectively. This information is useful when comparing kinematic studies and further supports the need for consensual methodology...|$|R

5000|$|Though proper mining {{operations}} at Kolar started only in 1880 the actual mining of gold ore itself is stated {{to go back}} many centuries. There are archival references to the Cholas of South India running small mining pits {{in the region and}} there are some references to Kolar being important for similar reasons under the Vijayanagaram rulers. Hyder Ali and Tipu Sultan attempting to extract gold from the Kolar pits with the help of French geologists is a recorded concern of the East India Company factors. Certainly, after the defeat of Tipu Sultan in 1799 and the [...] "discovery" [...] of gold in Kolar by surveyor Captain John Warren in 1802, there is curtain on Kolar till about 1850 when Michael Lavalle turned up in England and settled in his estate as a gentleman who made his fortune from the gold mines of Kolar. A <b>joint</b> stock company <b>floated</b> in England by Lavalle & his associates applied for a proper mining license from the Mysore government in 1873, which license was then sold to the British John Taylor & Company.|$|R
30|$|The {{floating}} elbow, {{defined as}} a simultaneous ipsilateral fracture of the humerus and forearm, is an uncommon injury occurring both in children [1, 2] and in adults [3, 4, 5, 6]. Two major categories of <b>floating</b> <b>joint</b> injuries have been described in the literature [4]: type- 1 consisting of skeletal disruption above and below an articulation without direct injury to the intermediate joint and type- 2 with combined skeletal and direct articular injury. A type- 3 lesion, including associated neurovascular damage of overlying soft tissue elements, with or without simultaneous articular involvement, was later described [7]. Two reports of rare variants of floating elbow injury have been published [8, 9], but {{to the best of}} our knowledge no recurrence of this injury has been described. We present a complex pattern of injury, occurring in the same limb 3  years after the healing of a floating elbow lesion, which included supracondylar fracture of the humerus and associated ipsilateral midshaft fracture of forearm bones (i.e., iterative floating elbow injury). A comprehensive literature review of the floating elbow injuries and the critical management of this unique case are reported in the manuscript.|$|R
50|$|In 2006, Walmart {{initiated}} {{talks with}} India-based Bharti Enterprises {{to enter the}} Indian market as India's restrictive commercial laws prohibited most foreign companies from setting up stores to compete with domestic retailers. Subsequently, they set up an equal <b>joint</b> venture to <b>float</b> a company called Bharti Walmart Private Limited in 2007, {{with the intention of}} doing wholesale business, through Best Price Modern Wholesale stores. It was decided that while Walmart would work towards back-end cash & carry supply chain for the wholesale operations of Bharti Walmart; it would also provide expertise including technology, supply chain, logistics and management support to the retail stores, Easyday, which will be run a wholly owned subsidiary of Bharti Enterprises named Bharti Retail Private Limited. Bharti Retail was set up in April 2007 with the target an annual turnover of about $3.65 billion by 2015. The major challenge for Easyday stores was the competition from small scale retailers who controlled about 97% of the Indian retail business. They organized protests against Easyday, which was supported by a section of politicians. Amid a stiff resistance from the opposition political parties, the Indian government allowed 51% Foreign Direct Investment in multi-brand retail in September 2012, which could enable Walmart to do direct retail business in India.|$|R
40|$|An airtight, {{flexible}} joint is disclosed for the interfacing of two pressure vessels such as between the Space Station docking tunnel and the Space Shuttle Orbiter bulkhead adapter. The joint provides for flexibility while still retaining a structural {{link between the}} two vessels required due to the loading created by the internal/external pressure differential. The joint design provides for limiting the axial load carried across the joint to a specific value, a function returned in the Orbiter/Station tunnel interface. The flex <b>joint</b> comprises a <b>floating</b> structural segment which is permanently attached {{to one of the}} pressure vessels through the use of an inflatable seal. The geometric configuration of the joint causes the tension between the vessels created by the internal gas pressure to compress the inflatable seal. The inflation pressure of the seal is kept at a value above the internal/external pressure differential of the vessels in order to maintain a controlled distance between the floating segment and pressure vessel. The inflatable seal consists of either a hollow torus-shaped flexible bladder or two rolling convoluted diaphragm seals which may be reinforced by a system of straps or fabric anchored to the hard structures. The joint acts as a flexible link to allow both angular motion and lateral displacement while it still contains the internal pressure and holds the axial tension between the vessels...|$|R
50|$|Jointed goatgrass is {{a winter}} annual grass seed native to Southern Europe and Russia, however {{currently}} {{there are at}} least 23 species distributed worldwide. It is considered a problem weed in United States, where it is now widely spread across western and central regions. It entered the US at several different times and at different locations, however the first was possibly in the late 19th century when Mennonite settlers from Russia brought Turkey winter wheat to Kansas. The first sample of jointed goatgrass was collected in Centerville, DE in 1870 and later samples collected in 1910 showed that jointed goatgrass had escaped from experimental plots on South Dakota State University campus at Brookings, SD.In 1999, it was reported that jointed goatgrass had infested an estimated 2 million hectares in the US alone, and that this was annually increasing {{at a rate of about}} 20 000 hectares. In 1986, jointed goatgrass had been reported as having infected less than 1% of winter wheat fields in seven counties in Nebraska, yet it was rated one of the ten most troublesome weeds, concerning 13% of respondents to a 1984 farmer survey.Human activities, wind, and machinery help to spread jointed goatgrass seeds once the joints disarticulate. However, due to the size of joints, wind dispersal is not as effective at spreading jointed goatgrass. Some of the human activities that helped spread jointed goatgrass include; planting contaminated wheat, allowing joints to blow from passing trucks hauling grain, transporting combines to different fields, or using straw spreaders on combines. Steven Miller argued that some states did not have laws that prevented contaminated winter wheat from being certified, which helped lead to it still being planted. Combines with straw spreaders are likely to spread jointed goatgrass joints farther than combines without these spreaders. Also, because the <b>joints</b> can <b>float,</b> runoff from fields can take them into rivers where they can aggregate and create an infestation in moist depressions, draws in fields, or along drainageways. It has been observed by growers and researchers that jointed goatgrass has a higher germination and emergence rate in compacted soils (such as in the wheel tracts of tractors) than in looser soils.|$|R
