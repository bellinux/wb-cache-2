25|$|In January 1958, the Aleppo Codex was smuggled out of Syria {{and sent}} to Jerusalem {{to be placed in}} the care of the chief rabbi of the Aleppo Jews. But by the {{influence}} of then President of Israel, Yitzhak Ben-Zvi, it was secretly taken by the government. In the late 1980s, the codex was placed in the Shrine of the Book at the Israel Museum. This finally gave scholars the chance to examine it and consider the claims that it is indeed the manuscript referred to by Maimonides. The work of Moshe Goshen-Gottstein on the few surviving pages of the Torah seems to have confirmed these claims beyond reasonable doubt. Goshen-Gottstein suggested (in the introduction to his <b>facsimile</b> <b>reprint</b> of the codex) that not only was it the oldest known masoretic Bible in a single volume, {{it was the first time}} ever that a complete Tanakh had been produced by one or two people as a unified entity in a consistent style.|$|E
