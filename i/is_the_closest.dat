5|$|Analysis of mtDNA {{sequences}} {{has confirmed}} morphological and biogeographical studies {{suggesting that the}} razorbill <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> living relative of the great auk. The great auk also was related closely to the little auk (dovekie), which underwent a radically different evolution compared to Pinguinus. Due to its outward similarity to the razorbill (apart from flightlessness and size), the great auk often {{was placed in the}} genus Alca, following Linnaeus.|$|E
5|$|Circinus also houses ESO 97-G13, {{commonly}} known as the Circinus Galaxy. Discovered in 1977, it is a relatively unobscured galaxy (magnitude 10.6), which is unusual for galaxies located in constellations near the Milky Way, since their dim light is obscured by gas and dust. This oblong spiral galaxy with 6.9by3.0arcminutes and 26,000light-years in diameter, is located 13 million light-years away from Earth and lies 4 degrees off the galactic plane. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> Seyfert galaxy to the Milky Way, and therefore hosts an active galactic nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Continuation Bond author Raymond Benson sees Vivienne Michel as {{the best}} {{realised}} female characterisation undertaken by Fleming, partly because {{the story is told}} in the first person narrative.

Hotel Breakers has standard hotel rooms, suites with views of Lake Erie, Snoopy-themed rooms and Wi-Fi in the lobby, rotunda and conference center. It has two pools, beach access, a conference center, and five restaurants including T.G.I. Friday's and Perkins Restaurant and Bakery.|$|E
5|$|I {{feel that}} {{talking about it}} trivializes it. I've been {{studying}} the Cabala , which is the mystical interpretation of the Torah. I've studied Buddhism and Hinduism and I've been practising yoga and obviously I {{know a lot about}} Catholicism. There are indisputable truths that connect all of them, and I find that very comforting and kind. My spiritual journey is to be open to everything. Pay attention to what makes sense, be absorbed. For me, yoga <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> thing to our real nature.|$|E
5|$|In medieval times, {{the wool}} trade was {{important}} in the town's economy, although this declined in the 18th century {{to be replaced by}} other industries such as brewing; the town continues to be a major centre for the production of cider. Shepton Mallet <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> town {{to the site of the}} Glastonbury Festival, the largest music festival in Europe.

5|$|Maryhill railway station, {{which is}} served by trains from Glasgow Queen Street, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> railway station to Firhill. The walk between the two sites takes between 20 and 25 minutes. On the Glasgow Subway network, Kelvinbridge and St George's Cross are within 15 minutes walk of the stadium. The A81 road (Maryhill Road), leading to Firhill Road, runs from the M8 motorway.|$|E
5|$|Muslim {{countries}} that retain or adopt Sharia usually determine which {{parts of the}} Sharia are enforceable and codify (and thereby modernize) them. Unlike other Muslim countries, Saudi Arabia regards uncodified Sharia in its entirety as {{the law of the}} land and does not interfere with it. It is, therefore, unique not only when compared to Western systems, but also in comparison to other Muslim countries, and according to one source <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> system in the modern world to the form of Sharia adopted at the advent of Islam.|$|E
5|$|Some {{scientists}} have {{hypothesized that the}} more rigid skull of Tarbosaurus was an adaptation to hunting the massive titanosaurid sauropods found in the Nemegt Formation, which {{did not exist in}} most of North America during the Late Cretaceous. The differences in skull mechanics also affect tyrannosaurid phylogeny. Tarbosaurus-like articulations between the skull bones are also seen in Alioramus from Mongolia, suggesting that it, and not Tyrannosaurus, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> relative of Tarbosaurus. Similarities between Tarbosaurus and Tyrannosaurus might therefore be related to their large size, independently developed through convergent evolution.|$|E

5|$|The Emirates Stadium {{is served}} {{by a number of}} London Underground {{stations}} and bus routes. Arsenal tube station <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> for the northern portion of the stadium, with Highbury & Islington tube station servicing the southern end. While Holloway Road tube station <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> to the southern portion, it is entry-only before matches and exit-only afterwards to prevent overcrowding. Drayton Park station, adjacent to the Clock End Bridge is shut on matchdays as the rail services to this station do not operate at weekends nor after 10pm. £7.6 million was set aside in the planning permission for upgrading Drayton Park and Holloway Road; however Transport for London decided not to upgrade either station, in favour of improvement works at the interchanges at Highbury & Islington and Finsbury Park, both of which are served by Underground and National Rail services and are approximately a ten-minute walk away. The Emirates Stadium is the only football stadium that stands beside the East Coast Main Line between London and Edinburgh and is just over 2 miles from London King's Cross.|$|E
