500|$|Herc {{carefully}} {{studied the}} dancers. [...] "I was smoking cigarettes and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> the records to finish. And I noticed people {{was waiting for}} {{certain parts of the}} record," [...] he says. It was an insight as profound as Ruddy Redwood's dub discovery. The moment when the dancers really got wild was in a song's short instrumental break, when the band would drop out and the rhythm section would get elemental. Forget melody, chorus, songs—it was all about the groove, building it, keeping it going. Like a string theorist, Herc zeroed in on the fundamental vibrating loop {{at the heart of the}} record, the break.|$|E
500|$|Yankovic {{waited for}} almost two years for the next [...] "big thing" [...] to emerge. [...] "I don't have any really good reason why it took so long {{other than the fact that}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> Michael Jackson's new album to come out," [...] Yankovic explained. Unfortunately for Yankovic, the new album hit several snags. On November 26, 1991, Michael Jackson's new album, Dangerous was released. After hearing the hit single [...] "Black or White," [...] Yankovic {{approached}} Jackson about a potential parody entitled [...] "Snack All Night." [...] Although Jackson was a big supporter of Yankovic's work, he felt that a parody might damage the song's message. Jackson told Yankovic that he could, if he wanted to, parody another song off his album, but just not [...] "Black or White".|$|E

[...] "We talked about having a family, but <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> her to grow up," [...] he says. She left him in 1976 for Glen Campbell and had one child (Dillon) with Campbell, whom she also left shortly after Dillon's birth. [...] "Obviously, I was right," [...] Davis once stated.|$|E

2500|$|Adele {{had said}} that she began writing it on her {{acoustic}} guitar {{in the wake of}} the break-up of her 18-month relationship with the 30-year-old man she thought she would marry. A few months after their split, he was engaged to someone else. [...] "We were so intense I thought we would get married. But that was something he never wanted... So when I found out he does want that with someone else, it was just the horrible-est feeling ever. But after I wrote it, I felt more at peace. It set me free... I didn't think it would resonate... with the world! I'm never gonna write a song like that again. I think that's the song I'll be known for." [...] She also said that [...] "I wrote that song on the end of my bed. I had a cold. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> my bath to run. I'd found out that he'd got engaged to someone else." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Chase-Opening race at Chicagoland Speedway {{started with}} {{qualifying}} being rained-out and Kyle Busch starting on Pole {{for being the}} fastest in first practice, and Chase Seed #1 Brad Keselowski wound up starting 25th for the 267 lap event. Busch led 46 laps early on, but the race saw comers and goers as it saw only a few cautions for the first 3/4 of the event. Jeff Gordon, Jamie McMurray, Keselowski, and Kevin Harvick (who led a race-high 79 laps) took turns at the front {{over the course of}} 100 laps of green. Keselowski and Harvick both suffered loose wheels and had to start at the tail-end of the lead lap. Chase driver Aric Almirola was leading on series of green flag pit stops with 30 to go when his engine blew and was forced to retire. Rookie Kyle Larson wound up taking the lead in the late going with a superior machine, battling Harvick, Gordon, and Keselowski in the late going with Keselowski making a three-wide move in between Larson and Harvick, taking the lead for good. With less than 10 laps to go, the final caution came out after Ricky Stenhouse, Jr. and Danica Patrick got together in Turn 4. On the final restart, Keselowski got away easy, Harvick fell to 5th, and Keselowski the #1 seed scored his 5th win of the season and second at Chicagoland. Gordon beat Larson for 2nd, and Joey Logano blew up out of Turn 4, but streaked across the finish line up in smoke to finish 4th. “I don’t really know what happened," [...] Keselowski said. [...] "I just know we got to the lead. I saw Kyle and Kevin racing each other really hard, they were aggressively side drafting and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>for</b> an opportunity to strike and it came. The car stuck and everything came together." ...|$|E
