5|$|Schizophrenia: The Epigenetic Puzzle {{outlined}} the approaches, conclusions and models Gottesman {{used in his}} study of schizophrenia. He co-wrote the book with James Shields, who died before it was published. The book introduces methods for diagnosing schizophrenia in a research setting, taking into account national <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the disorder was defined, debunked myths such as the mother transmitting schizophrenia, and introduced the concepts of the threshold model and the reaction range.|$|E

25|$|The {{reasons given}} by some smokers for this {{activity}} have been categorized as addictive smoking, pleasure from smoking, tension reduction/relaxation, social smoking, stimulation, habit/automatism, and handling. There are gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> much {{each of these}} reasons contribute, with females more likely than males to cite tension reduction/relaxation, stimulation and social smoking.|$|E
25|$|Fear is {{affected}} by cultural and historical context. For example, in the early 20th century, many Americans feared polio, a disease {{that can lead to}} paralysis. There are consistent cross-cultural <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> people respond to fear.

25|$|Eastern Nagari is less blocky {{and present}} a more sinuous shaping. Eastern Nagari {{is derived from}} the {{precursor}} script Siddham. The modern Eastern Nagari script was formalized in 1778 when it was first typeset by Charles Wilkins. In addition to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the letters are pronounced in the different languages, there are some minor typographical differences between the version of the script used for Assamese and Bengali languages.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} studies have shown that women tend to rely more on visual {{information}} than men in a number of spatial tasks related to perceived orientation. However, 'visual dependence' {{has been found to be}} task specific and not a general characteristic of spatial processing that differs between the sexes. Here an alternative hypothesis suggests that heightened visual dependence in females does not generalize to all aspects of spatial processing but is probably attributable to task-specific <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> male and females brains process multisensory spatial information.|$|E
25|$|With {{regards to}} {{cultural}} <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the genders view infidelity, {{it was observed}} that females found emotional infidelity much more distressful and males found sexual infidelity to be much more distressful than females. A comparison between modern day Chinese and American societies showed that there was greater distress with sexual infidelity in the US than in China. The cultural difference is most likely due to the more restrictive nature of Chinese society, thus, making infidelity a more salient concern. Sexual promiscuity is more prominent in the United States, thus it follows that American society is more preoccupied with infidelity than Chinese society (Geary et al. 1995).|$|E

25|$|The {{size of the}} {{production}} vocabulary ranges from about 50 to 550 words {{at the age of}} 2 years. Influences on the rate of word learning, and thus on the wide range of vocabulary sizes of children of the same age, include the amount of speech children are exposed to by their caregivers as well as <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> rich the vocabulary in the speech a child hears is. Children also seem to build up their vocabulary faster if the speech they hear is related to their focus of attention more often. This would be the case if a caregiver talks about a ball the child is currently looking at.|$|E
25|$|Kolkali is an {{art form}} {{involving}} {{both men and women}} and is unique to the area. It is the only folk art that is performed by both Hindus and Muslims, although there are slight <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the two do it. Muslims perform it as a form of entertainment during social gatherings and marriages, whereas the Hindus perform it at temple festivals. It involves rapid limb movements and simultaneous chanting of folksong, with the performers moving in pairs, hitting their batons (koles) against each other in a methodical way in tune with folksongs. It is played according to Vaithari or Thalam by the Gurukkal (Teacher).|$|E
25|$|While the Portuguese wine Port is {{similarly}} {{made with a}} mutage halting the fermentation, there are some distinct <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> vin doux naturels like Maurys are made. For one, the fortifying spirits used in Port are of a lower alcohol strength (traditionally 77%) while those used for vin doux naturels are often 95%. The spirits are then added to the VdNs later in the fermentation process than with Port. More of the fortifying spirits are often used in Port production, representing up to a fifth (20%) of the finished volume of wine compared to the spirits accounting for around 15% of the finished volume of the VdNs. This means that most VdNs contain less water and alcohol than the typical Port wine.|$|E

500|$|The {{estimated}} prevalence (number {{of people}} living with SCI) in the world ranges from 236 to 4187 per million. Estimates vary widely due to <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> data are collected and what techniques are used to extrapolate the figures. Little information is available from Asia, and even less from Africa and South America. In [...] Western Europe the estimated prevalence is 300 per million people and in North America it is 853 per million. It is estimated at 440 per million in Iran, 526 per million in Iceland, and 681 per million in Australia. In the United States there are between 225,000 and 296,000 individuals living with spinal cord injuries, and different studies have estimated prevalences from 525 to 906 per million.|$|E
500|$|There {{are also}} <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> this new age is envisioned. Those {{adhering}} to what Hanegraaff termed the [...] "moderate" [...] perspective {{believed that it}} would be marked by an improvement to current society, which affected both New Age concernsâ€”through the convergence of science and mysticism and the global embrace of alternative medicineâ€”to more general concerns, including an end to violence, crime and war, a healthier environment, and international co-operation. Other New Agers adopt a fully utopian vision, believing that the world will be wholly transformed into an [...] "Age of Light", with humans evolving into totally spiritual beings and experiencing unlimited love, bliss, and happiness. Rather than conceiving of the Age of Aquarius as an indefinite period, many believe that it would last for around two thousand years before being replaced by a further age.|$|E

2500|$|Very rare {{causes of}} {{awareness}} include drug tolerance, or a tolerance {{induced by the}} interaction of other drugs. [...] Some patients may be more resistant {{to the effects of}} anesthetics than others; factors such as younger age, obesity, tobacco smoking, or long-term use of certain drugs (alcohol, opiates, or amphetamines) may increase the anesthetic dose needed to produce unconsciousness but this is often used as an excuse for poor technique. There may be genetic variations that cause <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> quickly patients clear anesthetics, and there may be <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>how</b> the sexes react to anesthetics as well. In addition, anesthetic requirement is increased in persons with naturally red hair. Marked anxiety prior to the surgery can increase the amount of anesthesia required to prevent recall.|$|E
