50|$|Literally, an {{epidural}} needle {{is simply}} a needle that is placed into the epidural space.

Novel approaches include electrical epidural stimulation for physiological confirmation and segmental localization of epidural catheters, and ultrasound guidance for assessing related neuroanatomy and real-time observation of the needle puncture and, potentially, catheter advancement.

The study involves a prospective case series of 147 consecutive patients with radiological assessment of blind needle placement and epidurogram assessing the accuracy of blind needle placement in caudal epidurals. When the surgical miss rate (26 %) and failure of flow of the therapeutic agents (6 %) are combined, it can be deduced that up to 32 % of non-radiologically guided caudal epidurals may fail to deliver the therapeutic agents to the site of pathology. There was no significant difference in the accuracy of needle placement in adequately trained and experienced middle grade surgeons when compared with consultant surgeons performing these procedures regularly.

METHODS: Under laparoscopic visualization through a single umbilical port, an 18 -gauge <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> was inserted {{at the point}} of the internal ring. The orifice of the hernia defect was obliterated extraperitoneally by a non-absorbable suture that was introduced and withdrawn through the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> around the internal ring using the hydrodissection-lasso technique. RESULTS: A total of 251 inguinal repairs were performed by LASSO in 207 children. 163 patients had unilateral inguinal hernia repairs and 44 patients underwent repair of bilateral inguinal hernias. Mean operating time for unilateral and bilateral inguinal hernia repairs were 18. 1 A± 5. 4 min and 26. 6 A± 4. 8 min, respectively.

40|$|Headache in the {{postpartum}} {{period is}} common and multifactorial in origin. Apart from primary causes such as tension headaches and migraine, secondary headaches such as post-dural puncture headache (PDPH) are increasingly common because of {{increasing use of}} regional anaesthesia and analgesia during childbirth. Preventive measures for PDPH {{include the use of}} smaller gauge pencil-point needles for spinal blocks; <b>epidural</b> <b>needles</b> of 18 G or less; using saline rather than air for epidural space identification and the use of ultrasound guidance, especially for difficult cases such as morbid obesity and spinal deformities. In case of accidental dural puncture (ADP), the choice is between inserting the catheter in an adjacent space or intrathecal catheterization. Current evidence seems to be in favour of inserting the epidural catheter into the subarachnoid space and using the intrathecal catheter for analgesia/anaesthesia after prominently labelling it as intrathecal, to prevent misuse. It should be removed after at least 24 hours and a 10 ml bolus of saline injected before removal of catheter may be helpful. Either way, having written protocols for the management of accidental dural puncture helps to reduce the incidence of PDPH. PDPH can be disabling in severity and can mar the whole experience of childbirth. In addition, severe untreated PDPH can cause complications such as nerve palsies, subdural hematoma and cerebral venous thrombosis. Conservative methods of treatment should be tried first such as adequate hydration, paracetamol, caffeine, sumatriptan or ACTH/hydrocortisone. Epidural blood patching is the most effective treatment for PDPH. It is more effective if done 24 - 48 hours after dural puncture. It is an invasive procedure with its own complications as well as a failure rate of up to 30 %, so that a second or even third patch may be necessary. Both these facts should be intimated to the patient beforehand. Meticulous follow-up and evaluation of these patients is an important responsibility of the obstetric and anaesthetic team. Persistent headache, loss of the postural nature of the headache, altered sensorium, onset of focal neurological deficits and seizures are all features necessitating further investigation including neuroradiological imaging...|$|E
30|$|The {{spinal cord}} is perfused {{by a single}} {{anterior}} and two posterior spinal arteries. The ASA arises from the vertebral artery, descends {{the length of the}} spinal cord, and supplies blood to the anterior two thirds of the spinal cord. However, as the vertical connectivity of the ASA is poor, the areas of the spinal cord supplied by the ASA are vulnerable to ischemia. Occlusion of the ASA produces a clinical condition known as ASA syndrome. Its clinical features include motor paralysis, areflexia, and the loss of bowel and bladder sphincter function, and sensory changes include the absence of pain and temperature sensation, while proprioception and the ability to perceive vibrations are unimpaired due to the sparing of the posterior columns. The symptoms and signs seen in our case agree well with all of these clinical features of ASA syndrome. MRI is a reliable and sensitive means of evaluating SCI, which produce abnormal T 2 hyperintensity and enhancement on such scans [2]. Tumors, myelitis, and demyelination also produce abnormal T 2 hyperintensity, but in the present case, we were able to rule out those because of the clinical course of the patient’s conditions and “owl’s eye” appearance in the axial view of T 2 -weighted imaging (Fig.  1 b). Diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) is recognized as a sensitive and useful tool to detect acute SCI [5]. In DWI, SCI can be detected as early as 3  h after the onset, while it takes around 24  h for T 2 -weighted imaging to diagnose SCI [5]. We should have performed MRI, especially DWI, when the patient first complained of lower limb muscle weakness and a urinary disorder on POD 1. Hong et al. reported a case in which ASA syndrome occurred following lumbar epidural anesthesia for total hip arthroplasty and speculated that the cause of the ASA syndrome was a combination of intraoperative hypotension, the patient’s position, osteophytic narrowing of the intervertebral foramina, and adrenaline-induced vasoconstriction [4]. Hobai et al. [3] proposed the following risk factors for perioperative SCI: preexisting medical conditions (spinal stenosis, an aortic aneurysm, vasculitis, advanced age, pregnancy, and malignancy), epidural anesthesia (e.g., the administration of adrenaline and the rapid infusion of a large amount of solution), and intraoperative events (e.g., hypotension, extreme positioning, and vascular compression). In the present patient, intraoperative hypotension, spinal cord compression by an epidural hematoma, etc. were excluded as potential etiologies of the SCI. In addition, we did not administer adrenalin or a large amount of solution into the epidural space. Judging from the later onset of paraplegia and the lack of hematoma in the epidural space, occlusion of the feeding arteries of the ASA by a thromboembolism seems to be the most plausible explanation for the patient’s SCI. Indeed, the patient suffered from hypertension, diabetes mellitus, malignancy, and hyperlipidemia, all of which are risk factors for thromboembolisms. However, Akaishi et al. [6] have recently proposed that <b>epidural</b> <b>needles</b> and catheters can directly damage the spinal cord-nourishing arteries (including the anterior radicular arteries). According to their hypothesis, the persistent compression of a spinal cord-nourishing artery by an epidural catheter cannot be completely ruled out in the current case. Unfortunately, {{we were not able to}} examine this hypothesis because the epidural catheter was pulled out when we acquired the MRI scan, and angiography of the spinal cord was not performed. Although the infarction level (Th 3 to Th 8) was a little higher than the level at which the epidural puncture was actually performed (Th 8 – 9), the catheter could reach those areas because it was inserted and advanced based on the position of the needle’s cephalad.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackground and objectivesEpidural {{approach}} angle {{is one of}} the determining factors for needle traveling length to reach the epidural space. Likewise, the margin of safety against accidental dural puncture should be affected by epidural {{approach angle}} because the space available for <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> tip movement in the epidural space is depending on the inserting angle to the epidural space. The {{purpose of this study is}} to conjecture the effect of the angle formed with the skin and an <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> on the margin of safety against accidental dural puncture using a mathematical model. Case reportSuppose that the width of the epidural space is A mm and that the force advancing the epidural catheter is Ckgf and the diameter of the catheter is D mm. In this situation, assuming that the cephalad angle with the midline approach formed with the skin and an <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> is θ, the following parameters can be determined: the available distance for the needle tip in the epidural space = A/sinθmm; cephalad advancing force of catheter = C*cosθkgf; and the pressure at the site of dura matter where the epidural catheter is pushing = 400 *C*sinθ. πD− 2 kgf. cm− 2. The longer the distance available for the needle tip, the larger the margin of safety for dura injury by the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle.</b> It is supposed that θ should be set smaller to make the margin of safety larger. Likewise, smaller θ could decrease the pushing pressure and more effectively create a distinct cephalad advancing force. ConclusionsAcute cephalad angulation should be considered to increase the margin of safety for epidural approach and catheterization...|$|R

Some evidence indicates that dosing medications through the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> results in faster onset and improved quality of epidural anesthesia compared to dosing through the catheter, though these dosing techniques have not been compared in laboring women. This investigation was performed to determine whether dosing medication through the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> improves the quality of analgesia, level of sensory blockade, or onset of pain relief measured {{from the time of}} epidural medication injection. Methods: In this double-blinded prospective investigation, healthy term laboring women (n= 60) received labor epidural placement upon request. Epidural analgesia was initiated according to the assigned randomization group: 10 mL loading dose (0. 125 % bupivacaine with fentanyl 2  µg/mL) through either the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> or the catheter, given in 5 mL increments spaced 2 minutes apart. Verbal rating scale (VRS) pain scores (0 – 10) and pinprick sensory levels were documented to determine the rates of analgesic and sensory blockade onset. Results: No significant differences were observed in onset of analgesia or sensory blockade from the time of injection between study groups. The estimated difference in the rate of pain relief (VRS/minute) was 0. 04 (95 % CI: − 0. 01 to 0. 11; p= 0. 109), and the estimated difference in onset of sensory blockade (sensory level/minute) was 0. 63 (95 % CI: − 0. 02 to 0. 15; p= 0. 166). The time to VRS ≤ 3 and level of sensory block 20 minutes after dosing were also similar between groups. No differences in patient satisfaction, or maternal or fetal complications were observed.

40|$|For neuraxial anesthesia, successfijl <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> {{insertion}} is {{a complex}} procedure requiring penetration of several spinal tissue layers and stopping the needle {{as soon as the}} epidural space is reached. When the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> enters the <b>epidural</b> space, a part of the tissue resistive forces disappear abruptly, resulting in a needle overshoot.

Up to 10  ml of fibrin glue injectate was available to inject (the full capacity of the Tisseel© syringe), although the actual fibrin glue volume utilized was dependent upon the onset and intensity of patient paresthesia response alone (i.e., fibrin glue was injected until the patient experienced this paresthesia response).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Detecting {{inadvertent}} dural puncture during labour epidural insertion can {{be difficult}} when using a loss of resistance to saline technique. Testing fluid for glucose that leaks from a Tuohy needle may confirm the presence of cerebrospinal fluid and infer inadvertent dural puncture. This study compared the glucose content of intrathecal fluid obtained during spinal anaesthesia for elective caesarean delivery with that of fluid from a Tuohy <b>needle</b> or <b>epidural</b> catheter when establishing epidural analgesia for labour. METHODS: Women aged ≥ 18 years undergoing elective caesarean delivery and labouring parturients who requested epidural analgesia were recruited prospectively in a tertiary referral centre over a three-month period. Fluid was collected into a sterile container either during spinal anaesthesia or from a labour <b>epidural</b> <b>needle.</b> Glucose content was evaluated using a bedside blood glucometer and laboratory colorimetric analyzer. RESULTS: Of the 118 women approached, 115 participated. All 40 women having spinal anaesthesia and 2 / 75 (2. 7 %) women having epidural analgesia, in whom inadvertent dural puncture was subsequently confirmed, had fluid samples testing positive for glucose. Median [range] laboratory glucose readings were 2. 9 [1. 3 - 5. 1] mmol/L for cerebrospinal fluid and < 0. 3 mmol/L in fluid that leaked from a Tuohy needle (P= 0. 0001). CONCLUSION: When using a loss of resistance to saline technique for epidural catheter placement, bedside glucometer testing of fluid leaking from the <b>epidural</b> <b>needle</b> may be of value in the early detection of inadvertent dural puncture.
