50|$|Children <b>of</b> the <b>eldest</b> son <b>of</b> a peer also {{obtain a}} special precedence. Generally, the <b>eldest</b> son <b>of</b> the <b>eldest</b> son <b>of</b> a peer comes {{immediately}} before his uncles, while the younger sons <b>of</b> the <b>eldest</b> son <b>of</b> a peer come after them. Therefore, <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> dukes come before younger sons of dukes, and younger sons <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> dukes come after them, {{and so forth}} for all the ranks. Below the younger sons of barons are baronets, knights, circuit judges and companions of the various orders of Chivalry, followed by the <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> younger sons of peers.|$|R
50|$|Wives {{of all of}} the {{aforementioned}} have precedence corresponding to their husbands', unless otherwise entitled to a higher precedence, for instance by virtue of holding a certain office. An individual's daughter takes precedence after the wife <b>of</b> that individual's <b>eldest</b> son and before the wives of that individual's younger sons. Therefore, daughters of peers rank immediately after wives <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> peers; daughters <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> peers rank immediately after wives <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> peers; daughters of younger sons of peers rank after wives <b>of</b> <b>eldest</b> sons <b>of</b> younger sons of peers. Such a daughter keeps her precedence if marrying a commoner (unless that marriage somehow confers a higher precedence), but rank as their husband if marrying a peer.|$|R
