5|$|<b>Epilepsy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{group of}} {{neurological}} disorders characterized by epileptic seizures. Epileptic seizures are episodes that {{can vary from}} brief and nearly undetectable to long periods of vigorous shaking. These episodes can result in physical injuries including occasionally broken bones. In epilepsy, seizures tend to recur and as a rule, have no immediate underlying cause. Isolated seizures that are provoked by a specific cause such as poisoning are not deemed to represent epilepsy. People with epilepsy {{in some areas of}} the world experience stigma due to the condition.|$|E
25|$|<b>Epilepsy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> common chronic {{neurological}} disorder characterized by seizures. These seizures are transient signs and/or symptoms of abnormal, excessive or hypersynchronous neuronal {{activity in the}} brain.|$|E

25|$|<b>Epilepsy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> common {{neurological}} disease that {{is characterized by}} recurrent and sometimes untreatable seizures. Several clinical and experimental data have implicated the failure of blood–brain barrier function in triggering chronic or acute seizures. Some studies implicate the interactions between a common blood protein (albumin) and astrocytes. These findings suggest that acute seizures are a predictable consequence of disruption of the BBB by either artificial or inflammatory mechanisms. In addition, expression of drug resistance molecules and transporters at the BBB are a significant mechanism of resistance to commonly used anti-epileptic drugs.|$|E
25|$|Some {{disorders}} cause a {{wide array}} of affects, and language impairment is merely one of many possible symptoms. The two major disorders of this type are the autism spectrum disorders and epilepsy. Autism and other autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are disorders in which the patient suffers from decreased social skills and lowered mental flexibility. As a result, many patients suffering ASDs also have language problems, arising from both the lack of social interaction and lowered mental flexibility. <b>Epilepsy</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> disorder where electrical malfunctions or mis-communications in the brain cause seizures, leading to muscle spasms and activation of other organs and systems of the body. Over time, epilepsy can lead to cognitive and behavioral decay. This mental decay can eventually lead to a loss of language and communication skills.|$|E

40|$|Progressive myoclonic <b>epilepsies</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> {{group of}} {{disorders}} characterised by a relentlessly progressive disease course until death; treatment-resistant <b>epilepsy</b> <b>is</b> just <b>a</b> {{part of the}} phenotype. This umbrella term encompasses many diverse conditions, ranging from Lafora body disease to Gaucher's disease. These diseases as <b>a</b> group <b>are</b> important because of a generally poor response to antiepileptic medication, an overall poor prognosis and inheritance risks to siblings or offspring (where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> proven genetic cause). A correct diagnosis also helps {{patients and their families}} to accept and understand the nature of their disease, even if incurable.

40|$|Objectives: This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the knowledge and attitudes of primary school managers regarding epilepsy among school children in Erbil City, Iraq. Methods: <b>A</b> cross-sectional study <b>was</b> conducted in primary schools between 18 June and 18 August 2013. A total of 80 primary school managers were selected to answer a questionnaire covering three domains: socio-demographical characteristics, knowledge of epilepsy and attitudes towards epilepsy. Results: More {{than half of the}} participants (55 %) had spent less than 10 years in school administration. More than one-third (37. 5 %) of the participants believed that <b>epilepsy</b> <b>was</b> <b>an</b> infectious disease, and over half of the respondents (53. 75 %) stated that <b>epilepsy</b> cannot <b>be</b> treated or prevented. Conclusion: Although the respondents’ attitudes towards pupils with <b>epilepsy</b> <b>were</b> generally positive, their knowledge of <b>epilepsy</b> <b>was</b> imperfect; thus, <b>an</b> <b>epilepsy</b> education campaign <b>is</b> required. This should focus on the causes of epilepsy and its management...|$|R

50|$|Autosomal {{dominant}} nocturnal {{frontal lobe}} <b>epilepsy</b> (ADNFLE) <b>is</b> <b>an</b> idiopathic localization-related <b>epilepsy</b> that <b>is</b> <b>an</b> inherited epileptic disorder that causes seizures during sleep.

Vocalizations such as shouting, moaning, or crying are also common. ADNFLE is often misdiagnosed as nightmares. ADNFLE has a genetic basis.
