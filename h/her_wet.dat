2500|$|However, {{the first}} {{indication}} of Lily's strength of character comes from November 1885, when she was twelve years old. One day, [...] "Miss May Harris, with her two little sisters, Violet and Lily, and Miss Gaynor, a guest, {{went down to the}} beach to bathe, and a little while afterwards Mrs. Harris followed them down to look after them. On her way to the beach, and when, a little way only from it, her attention was caught by some brushwood and dry grass which she thought might harbour snakes. She accordingly set fire to it with the hope of removing it, and was still engaged in the operation, when she suddenly – the fire having spread without her noticing it – found that her dress had caught ablaze, and that the sleeves were burning. This was the first intimation she had of her danger, and she at once screamed out, and rolling herself on the ground, tried to put out the fire in that way. Lily, the younger of the twins, was the only one near enough to assist her mother, and rushing up, the little child had {{the presence of mind to}} pull off <b>her</b> <b>wet</b> bathing dress and wrap it round her mother's body, thus saving her from much worse injuries than those she received. Mrs Harris was taken home, and was found to be suffering from severe burns on the arms and back." ...|$|E
2500|$|After filing suit, Reavis went to California {{to locate}} {{witnesses}} who {{were familiar with}} the details of Sophia's youth. [...] During October and November 1890 a series of depositions were held in San Francisco and Los Angeles to take testimony from the witnesses he had located. [...] Key witness located during this process were Miguel Noe Sr., his son Miguel Jr., Andrés Sandoval, Alfred Sherwood, and John Snowball. [...] Noe testified to having been a friend of José Ramon Carmen Maso and to having met the second Baron during his time in California before his trip to Spain. [...] The testimony included a wide variety of details related to the second Baron's stay and included Noe accompanying the Baron to Sherwood Valley to confirm that his granddaughter was well cared for. [...] The senior Noe's testimony was supported by Miguel Jr. relaying his childhood memories of the second Baron. [...] Sandoval testified to having run a boardinghouse and restaurant where the second Baron and his son-in-law had stayed while they were in San Francisco. [...] Sherwood provided details of Sophia's life from when she had been brought home by John Treadway at four months of age in July 1862, how she had been attended by <b>her</b> <b>wet</b> nurse and grandmother, and how her grandmother had told the young girl of a large inheritance she would someday receive. [...] Snowball in turn testified as to how he had taken the orphaned girl into his house when she was eight and raised her till 1876, when she left to work with a dressmaker. [...] Other witnesses filled in additional details of Sophia's life between 1879 and 1882.|$|E

50|$|He {{suspects}} that Jack Cannon's mentor Helen Rutherford's symptoms are actually Alice's symptoms that she's {{been writing about}} in her book. The symptoms are joint pain, fatigue, light sensitivity and depression. When they add those to Alice's pericardial effusion, her seizures and <b>her</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>her</b> bed, they get lupus. House doesn't like this diagnosis as it's not curable {{and he wants to}} take her pain away so she'll keep writing, but he orders the test anyway.|$|R

Whilst the win itself was a surprise, her acceptance speech was received very well as being highly entertaining, claiming that she was so excited that she had <b>wet</b> <b>her</b> dress. The speech was apparently completely improvised. Backstage, when told not to tell her mother about <b>her</b> <b>wetting</b> <b>her</b> dress, she told the host that her mum was dead before dedicating her award to her [...] "dead mum". She also won the Critics' Circle Theatre Award for [...] "Best Shakespearean Performance" [...] in Much Ado About Nothing, becoming the first woman to win the award, and was nominated for [...] "The FRANCO'S Best Actress in a Play" [...] in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers' Choice Awards.|$|R
