5|$|The show {{planned a}} {{dramatic}} stunt which {{would lead to}} the discovery of Callum's body. The scene featured Carla Connor (Alison King) causing a car accident, colliding with Tyrone Dobbs' (Alan Halsall) pick-up truck which smashes into the Platt's home. This causes the floor to give way and a recovery team unearthing Callum's body. Producers decided to conclude the story without Kylie being <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder. Instead they used a character that had been recently killed off, Tony Stewart (Terence Maynard), who had publicly feuded with Callum. When Sarah confesses the truth to Todd Grimshaw (Bruno Langley), he decides to frame Tony for the crime–a scheme which proved successful.|$|E

25|$|On April 21, 1975, the {{remaining}} {{members of the}} SLA robbed the Crocker National Bank in Carmichael, California. During the robbery, bank customer Myrna Lee Opsahl, a 42-year old mother of four children, was killed when Emily Harris discharged the shotgun she was holding, apparently by accident. Five SLA members were ultimately <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> murder and robbery, but not until almost 27 years later, in early 2002.|$|E
25|$|Members of the DSV {{are elected}} for {{a term of}} four years, while no one may serve more than two terms. Before taking office, members must take an oath.

25|$|Various legal cases arose {{surrounding}} the dubbing of cassettes. In the UK, {{in the case}} of CBS Songs v. Amstrad (1988), the House of Lords found in favor of Amstrad that producing equipment that facilitated the dubbing of cassettes, in this case a high-speed twin cassette deck that allowed one cassette to be copied directly onto another, did not constitute the infringement of copyright. In a similar case, a shop owner who rented cassettes and sold blank tapes was not liable for copyright infringement even though it was clear that his customers likely were dubbing them at home. In both cases, the courts held that manufacturers and retailers could not be <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> actions of consumers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} half of 2006, Beazley {{focussed}} much of the Labor Party's parliamentary inquiry into the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) scandal, which allegedly involved bribes and kickbacks with the then Iraqi dictator, Saddam Hussein, that universally breached UN sanctions, to which Australia was a signatory. The situation reached a climax in the aftermath of Treasurer Peter Costello's 2006 Budget, whereby {{for the first time in}} recent Australian political history, the opposition leader and his colleagues ceased inquiry on the budget papers after just six questions, before resuming further questioning on the AWB scandal. The media criticised the ALP, although many ministers acknowledged the need for the Government to be <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> AWB scandal.|$|E
25|$|Rear Admiral Patricio Montojo y Pasarón (September 7, 1839 – September 30, 1917) was {{a career}} Spanish naval officer who {{commanded}} the restored Kingdom of Spain's Pacific Squadron {{based in the}} Philippines during the Spanish–American War. Considered {{to have been a}} man of high ability and experience, he was given what was regarded as an impossible task of defending the Spanish Philippines with antiquated ships and low supplies against the more formidable U.S. Asiatic Squadron. Montojo became known for his defeat at the Battle of Manila Bay (1 May 1898) by U.S. Navy Admiral George Dewey, being a decisive naval battle of the war. After the conflict, the rear admiral was <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> defeat and was court-martialed, but that was later overturned, though Montojo was still discharged from the Spanish Navy.|$|E

25|$|In {{spite of}} {{the enormity of the}} disaster, no one was ever held accountable. Capt. Frederic Speed, a Union officer who sent the 1,978 paroled prisoners into Vicksburg from the parole camp, was charged with grossly {{overcrowding}} Sultana and found guilty. However, the guilty verdict was overturned by the judge advocate general of the army on grounds that Speed had been at the parole camp all day and had never placed one single soldier on board the Sultana. Captain Williams, who had placed the men on board, was a regular army officer and graduate of West Point, so the military refused to go after one of their own. And Colonel Hatch, who had concocted a bribe with Captain Mason to crowd as many men onto the Sultana as possible, had quickly quit the service and was now a civilian, no longer accountable to a military court. In the end, no one was ever <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> greatest maritime disaster in United States history.|$|E
25|$|However, as {{years went}} {{by the number of}} {{captured}} vessels became consistently smaller due to Spain's shifting its focus to the Mediterranean. Enríquez also lost his influence within the Church with the arrival of a new bishop, Sebastián Lorenzo Pizarro, who declined any gift or favor that he offered. After the war ended, the Empire's relation with Great Britain normalized, further complicating this venture. Under this circumstances, the work of Enríquez served as an obstacle and by 1731, Mendizábal's last year in office, he was no longer considered a key asset in the New Word. In 1731, Enríquez sent two sloops to spy a British warship that had been sailing adjacent to San Juan for a week. This action interfered with the international relation between both nations, Patiño now intended to rebuild the Empire's armada and required peace to accomplish this task. The sudden change in geopolitics combined with conclusion of Mendizábal's term to begin a downward spiral in Enríquez's life. On October 11, 1731, Matías de Abadía docked at San Juan and took office a few hours later. He arrived in one of Enríquez's ships after his original vessel lost registration midway. A military officer, Abadía was accompanied by three trusted men, who were quickly placed in the pivotal offices of treasurer of Puerto Rico, overseer and manager of the city. Even before traveling to San Juan, the governor had orders to settle the constant conflicts between its residents. Abadía was also placed in charge of attending Camino's case against Enríquez and of investigating the assassination attempts. Following his intervention, the cases of Danío and Álvarez were suddenly re-evaluated by the Council of the Indies and Enríquez was forced to pay 4,000 pieces of eight to the former governor, {{despite the fact that the}} investigation had already been closed. Álvarez was also released and reinstated in his military position, with the privateer being forced to pay again. The influence that Enríquez once possessed was now wavering and he was likely being <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> incidents of the previous decades. His enemies exploited this and bishop Pizarro aligned himself with the governor, only contacting the privateer to order the use of his vessels for transportation. The fact that Spain needed an scapegoat to appease Great Britain complicated his position.|$|E

He overcame this handicap with dexterity, despite frequent clashes with the Minister of Defence, Richard Seddon, known to be a difficult man.|$|R

25|$|According to The Washington Post, a {{percentage}} of Gazans <b>held</b> Hamas <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> humanitarian crisis and wanted the militants to stop firing rockets from their neighborhoods to avoid Israeli reaction. Some of the Gazans have attempted to protest against Hamas, which routinely accuses protesters of being Israeli spies and has killed more than 50 such protesters. Around 6 August, Palestinian protesters reportedly attacked and beat up Hamas spokesperson Sami Abu Zuhri because they blamed Hamas for inciting Operation Protective Edge.|$|R
500|$|Sheila Dikshit, who at {{that time}} was the Chief Minister of Delhi, said that she did not have the courage to meet the victim and {{described}} Delhi as a [...] "rape capital" [...] in interviews.

500|$|Colonel Powell's wound {{received}} at Wytheville was {{judged to be}} fatal by surgeons for both the Union and Confederate armies. When the Union army departed from Wytheville, Powell was left behind with other wounded soldiers {{who could not be}} moved. These men became prisoners of the Confederacy. The citizens of Wytheville blamed Powell for the burning of many of the community's homes. For his own safety, Powell was hidden. Confederate General Sam Jones wanted Powell <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> burning of two buildings from an earlier raid, and added that Powell was [...] "...one of the most dangerous officers we have had to contend with..." [...] Surprisingly, Powell recovered enough from his wound that he was moved to a Richmond prison. While in captivity there, he was fed only bread and water, and slept on the floor. Lieutenant Colonel David Dove, who was recovering from a severe wound suffered earlier in the year, returned to camp in October. During Powell's absence, Dove was in command of the regiment.|$|E
500|$|Colonel Powell's {{wound to}} his back was judged to be fatal by {{surgeons}} for both the Union and Confederate armies. One historian believed that Powell also lost an eye in this battle, but his eye was permanently injured before the war. When the Union army departed from Wytheville, Powell was left behind with other wounded soldiers {{that could not be}} moved. These men became prisoners of the Confederacy. The citizens of Wytheville blamed Powell for the burning of many of the community's homes. General Jones wanted Powell <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> burning of two buildings from an earlier raid, and added that Powell was [...] "...one of the most dangerous officers we have had to contend with..." [...] For his own safety, Powell was hidden. Several local women were instrumental in preventing retaliation on the blue-coated prisoners. Powell unexpectedly healed, and was eventually moved to Richmond's Libby Prison where he survived for a portion of that time in a dungeon on a bread and water diet. He was exchanged for Colonel Richard H. Lee in early February 1864, and returned to the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry during March 1864. Years after the fighting, the 2nd West Virginia Cavalry's Captain Fortescue (Company I), wrote [...] "...though I was afterwards on many hotly contested fields, I was never upon any that was more so than Wytheville." ...|$|E

500|$|Both campaigns {{began to}} use their running mates to attack the other candidate. Republican Vice Presidential nominee Spiro Agnew criticized the current Vice President for being [...] "soft on communism" [...] and [...] "soft on {{inflation}} and soft on law and order." [...] He then compared the nominee to former British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain. But Agnew often made gaffes on the campaign trail, in contrast to Muskie who {{was viewed as a}} natural campaigner. In Missouri, in preparation for a meeting with former President Harry Truman, Muskie tried to defend his running mate from connections made by the Nixon campaign to the Johnson administration. He reversed the accusation by claiming that Nixon should be <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> shortcomings of the Eisenhower Administration, under his logic. He then lambasted the Republican ticket for ignoring such issues as urban renewal, housing, and federal aid for education and sewage. Muskie was renowned for his speaking ability, and was known to turn around hostile crowds including one well publicized event when he asked an anti-war protester to join him on the stage. Although he provided a small boost for the campaign, Nixon remained fifteen points ahead, 44% to 29% in the September 27 Gallup poll. Diplomat George W. Ball soon resigned his position in the Johnson administration to campaign for and advise Humphrey, hoping to prevent a Nixon victory. At the end of September, Humphrey's chances for the presidency further declined as media outlets observed that the Republican Party would be the likely winners in the election. Humphrey acknowledged his odds, proclaiming at an event in Boston: [...] "regardless of the outcome of this election, I want it to be said of Hubert Humphrey that at an important and tough moment of his life he stood up for what he believed and was not shouted down." [...] The comment drew boos from the crowd. Individuals close to the campaign noted that Humphrey looked tired and worn-out while flying from stop to stop, but would brighten up when he encountered a crowd.|$|E
500|$|Miguel Primo de Rivera came {{to power}} in a {{military}} coup in 1923 and ran Spain as a military dictatorship. He handed monopolistic control of trade union power to the UGT, and introduced a sweeping programme of public works. These public works were extremely wasteful, including hydroelectric dams and highways causing the deficit to double between 1925 and 1929. Spain's financial situation was made far worse by the pegging of the peseta to the gold standard and by 1931 the peseta had lost nearly half its value. The UGT was brought into the government to set up industrial arbitration boards, though this move was opposed by some in the group and was seen as opportunism by anarchist leaders. He also attempted to defend the agrarian–industrial monarchist coalition formed during the war. No significant reform to the political system (and in particular the monarchy) was instituted. This made forming a new government difficult, as existing problems had not been rectified. Gradually, his support faded because his personal approach to political life ensured he was personally <b>held</b> <b>accountable</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> government's failings, and due to an increasing frustration over his interference in economic matters he didn't understand. José Calvo Sotelo, his finance minister, was one person to withdraw support, and de Rivera resigned in January 1930. There was little support for a return to the pre-1923 system, and the monarchy had lost credibility by backing the military government. Dámaso Berenguer was ordered by the king to form a replacement government, but his dictablanda dictatorship failed to provide a viable alternative. The choice of Berenguer annoyed another important general, José Sanjurjo, who believed himself to be a better choice. In the municipal elections of 12 April 1931, little support was shown for pro-monarchy parties in the major cities, and large numbers of people gathered in the streets of Madrid. King Alfonso XIII abdicated to prevent a [...] "fratricidal civil war". The Second Spanish Republic was formed.|$|E
2500|$|Feminist {{science and}} {{technology}} studies (STS) refers to the transdisciplinary field {{of research on the}} ways gender and other markers of identity intersect with technology, science, and culture. [...] The practice emerged from feminist critique on the masculine-coded uses of technology in the fields of natural, medical, and technical sciences, and its entanglement in gender and identity.
