5|$|When Lichtenstein had {{his first}} solo show at the Leo Castelli Gallery in February 1962, it sold out before opening. <b>Golf</b> <b>Ball</b> {{was one of the}} works that Lichtenstein exhibited. Later, Lichtenstein {{included}} <b>Golf</b> <b>Ball</b> in Still Life with Goldfish Bowl, 1972, and Go for Baroque, 1979. The painting exemplifies the novel superimposition of abstraction and figuration. The work also represents abstraction as a result of elimination of three-dimensionality, chiaroscuro and a landscape context.|$|E
5|$|A {{saprobic}} species, Lycoperdon perlatum grows solitarily, scattered, or {{in groups}} or clusters on the ground. It can also grow in fairy rings. Typical habitats include woods, grassy areas, and along roads. It {{has been reported}} from Pinus patula plantations in Tamil Nadu, India. The puffball sometimes confuses golfers because of its resemblance to a <b>golf</b> <b>ball</b> when viewed from a distance.|$|E

5|$|Taft upset some {{progressives}} {{by choosing}} Hitchcock as Chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), placing him {{in charge of}} the presidential campaign. Hitchcock was quick to bring in men closely allied with big business. Taft took an August vacation in Hot Springs, Virginia, where he irritated political advisors by spending more time on golf than strategy. After seeing a newspaper photo of Taft taking a large swing at a <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> Roosevelt warned him against candid shots.|$|E
5|$|The {{story that}} the young Bradman practised alone with a cricket stump and a <b>golf</b> <b>ball</b> is part of Australian folklore. Bradman's {{meteoric}} rise from bush cricket to the Australian Test team took just over two years. Before his 22nd birthday, he had set many records for top scoring, some of which still stand, and became Australia's sporting idol {{at the height of}} the Great Depression.|$|E
5|$|Bradman practised batting incessantly {{during his}} youth. He invented his own solo cricket game, using a cricket stump for a bat, and a <b>golf</b> <b>ball.</b> A water tank, {{mounted on a}} curved brick stand, stood on a paved area behind the family home. When hit into the curved brick facing of the stand, the ball rebounded at high speed and varying angles—and Bradman would attempt to hit it again. This form of {{practice}} developed his timing and reactions to a high degree. In more formal cricket, he hit his first century {{at the age of}} 12, with an undefeated 115 playing for Bowral Public School against Mittagong High School.|$|E

25|$|In reverse {{swing the}} seam is angled {{in the same}} way as in {{conventional}} swing (10–20 degrees to one side) but the boundary layer on both sides is turbulent. The net effect of the seam and rough side is that the ball swings in the direction opposite to where the seam is pointing to. The turbulent boundary layer separating later is similar to the effect produced by dimples in a <b>golf</b> <b>ball.</b> In case of the <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> turbulence is produced on both sides of the ball and the net effect is a later separation of boundary layer on both sides and smaller wake in the back of the ball and a lower net drag due to pressure differential between the front and the back – this enables the <b>golf</b> <b>ball</b> to travel farther.|$|E

50|$|There {{are many}} types of <b>golf</b> <b>balls</b> on the market, and {{customers}} often face a difficult decision. <b>Golf</b> <b>balls</b> are divided into two categories: recreational and advanced balls. Recreational balls are oriented toward the ordinary golfer, who generally have low swing speeds (80 mph or lower) and lose <b>golf</b> <b>balls</b> on the course easily. These balls are made of two layers, with the cover firmer than the core. Their low compression and side spin reduction characteristics suit the lower swing speeds of average golfers quite well. Furthermore, they generally have lower prices than the advanced balls, lessening the financial impact of losing a ball to a hazard or out of bounds.|$|R

25|$|Due to its location, Billings is {{susceptible}} to severe weather. In most cases, severe storms travel fast at 25 to 30 miles per hour. The first recorded tornado to touch down in Billings was on June 2, 1958. On June 20, 2010, a tornado dubbed the Father's Day Tornado touched down in the Billings Heights and Downtown sections of the city. The tornado was accompanied by hail up to <b>golf</b> <b>ball</b> size, dangerous cloud-to-ground lightning, and heavy winds. The tornado destroyed a number of businesses and severely damaged the 12,000-seat Rimrock Auto Arena at MetraPark.|$|E
25|$|IBM and Remington Rand {{electric}} typewriters {{were the}} leading models until IBM introduced the IBM Selectric typewriter in 1961, which replaced the typebars with a spherical element (or typeball) slightly {{smaller than a}} <b>golf</b> <b>ball,</b> with reverse-image letters molded into its surface. The Selectric used a system of latches, metal tapes, and pulleys driven by an electric motor to rotate {{the ball into the}} correct position and then strike it against the ribbon and platen. The typeball moved laterally in front of the paper, instead of the previous designs using a platen-carrying carriage moving the paper across a stationary print position.|$|E
