Elements of Constantine's life eventually <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> into the epic poem Digenes Akrites.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near the {{marketplace}} of the Bucharest neighborhood Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety.

It had been hypothesised that P. luridipennis and Ceutorhynchus contractus var. pallipes may help pollinate the Lundy cabbage, but observations of the taxa indicate that neither visit flowers. While there are no honey bees on Lundy, other species of winged insects are present. The plant may rely primarily upon pollen beetles of the genus Meligethes and the wind for pollination.|$|E

Thousands of sculptures of this period have been discovered and they now form part of the collections of a number of museums in Bangladesh. Many of them have also <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> into a number of museums in Europe and America. Most of these sculptures have been found through the excavations in Somapura Mahavihara. Pala sculpture derives its origins from the late Gupta style, but later on deviated from it.|$|R
2500|$|HCE {{speakers}} have {{modified the}} meanings of some English words. For example, [...] "aunty" [...] and [...] "uncle" [...] may either refer to any adult who is a friend or be used to show respect to an elder.

For example, instead of [...] "it is hot today, isn't it?", an HCE speaker would say simply [...] "stay hot, eh?" [...] The term da kine is used as a filler; a substitute for virtually any word or phrase. During the surfing boom in Hawaii, HCE was influenced by surfer slang.

A commonly repeated theme by those supporting censorship, and one mentioned in the Code itself was {{the notion that the}} common people needed to be saved from themselves by the more refined cultural elite.Massey, pg. 71.|$|E

A new date of February 3, 2003 was set, only {{for it to be}} recalled again without explanation, although some copies quickly <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> to collectors' venues such as eBay.

The Yugoslav and Romanian ambassadors also ended up in Rome but were told in 1944 {{to be ready to}} return at a moment's notice. The Baltic nuncios in Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania were forced out by Russian troops. Although the nuncios de jure retained their titles, their role was either terminated or de facto taken up by Cesare Orsenigo, the nuncio to Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{beginnings}} of the video film market in Nigeria is {{traced back to the}} 1980s when television productions thrived. Many of the television productions often <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> into VHS, leading {{to the development of a}} small scale informal video trade. This method was adopted and built on by producers and distributors at Alaba market to reinvent the film industry which was at the time facing a major decline. The first film produced on video in Nigeria is 1988's Soso Meji, produced by Ade Ajiboye. Subsequently, Alade Aromire produced Ekun (1989) on video. However, the boom experienced in this era is generally believed to have been kick started by Kenneth Nnebue's Living in Bondage (1992), although some historians claim otherwise.|$|R

A large slaveholder, Dixon introduced numerous measures {{to protect the rights of}} slaveholders in the new constitution. Among them were assertions that slave property was just as inviolable as any other property, that the rights of property were above constitutional sanction, and that absolute power over property cannot exist in a republic.

5|$|Amidst {{the flames}} and rubble, Arenberg's and Ferdinand's troops tried to storm the castle, but <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>way</b> blocked by masses of debris created {{by their own}} explosives. Furthermore, {{although}} close to half of the garrison had perished in the explosion and subsequent collapse of the fortifications, those who remained offered staunch resistance by throwing rocks on the approaching attackers, causing {{a large number of}} casualties. In frustration, 40 or 50 of the attackers tied together two ladders and crawled through the sluice-ways of the garderobe (latrines) that emptied on the hillside, thus gaining access to the interior of the castle. There they killed around 20 of the defenders in fierce fighting; the remaining defenders, approximately 70 men, among them Buchner and Sudermann, the garrison commander and his lieutenant, sought refuge in the castle's keep. In this way, Ferdinand's infantry at last gained unopposed access to the fortress. Storming the castle had taken about two hours.|$|E

40|$|The tapetal {{cells in}} trifoliate orange were studied prior to liberation of pollen grains under light and {{transmission}} electron microscopes. The tapetum was glandular or secretory type {{and consisted of}} two-layered flattened cells immediately below the 2 - 3 layered elongated parietal cells and anther wall. It surrounded the pollen sacs where numerous pollen grains were embedded freely. Many sporopollenin-like granules appeared throughout the tapetal zone releasing from the territory of tapetum and parietal layers. These granules moved through the intercellular spaces and <b>found</b> <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> towards the pollen grains which were finally absorbed by the bacula of grain walls. The multi-layered rough endoplasmic reticulum appeared near these absorption sites. The tapetal cells were devoid of distinct walls or they had only very thin envelopes.
