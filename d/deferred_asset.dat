40|$|The {{issuance}} of Brazilian Law 11. 638 / 2007 {{is a critical}} step in the convergence of the Brazilian Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAPs) towards International Financial Reporting Standards. After the law was implemented and later modified by Provisional Executive Order 449 / 2008 (converted into Law 11. 941 / 2009), certain accounting choices were allowed during the transition period. The Brazilian GAAPs allowed for restructuring costs and costs related to opening a new facility to be recognised as assets. As a transitional provision, companies were allowed to choose between maintaining or eliminating these values. In this paper, we attempted to identify which company characteristics were associated with this accounting choice. The final sample consisted of Brazilian companies listed on the BM & FBOVESPA, and a logistic regression identified two characteristics.

The 2007 Spanish General Accounting Plan approved by Royal Decree 1514 / 2007, of November 16 th differentiates between the current income tax expense (income) and the deferred income tax expense (income). The total tax expense or income is the sum of these two items, which should nonetheless be quantified separately. On the one hand, the current income tax expense is the amount payable by the company as a result of income tax settlements for a given year. Conversely, the deferred income tax expense reflects in essence the recognition and settlement of <b>deferred</b> tax <b>assets</b> and liabilities. A <b>deferred</b> tax <b>asset</b> or liability represents the increase or decrease in taxes payable or refundable in future years as a result of temporary differences and any net operating loss or tax credit carry-forwards that exist at the reporting date.

Recognition of the <b>deferred</b> tax <b>asset</b> partially mitigates the negative earnings impact of the special charge.
