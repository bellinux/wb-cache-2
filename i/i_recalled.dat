25|$|In 550, the Gothic War {{was in its}} fifteenth year. The {{first years}} of the war had seen a series of successes for the {{relatively}} small Byzantine invasion force under Belisarius, which had led to the fall of Ravenna and the apparent restoration of Imperial rule over Italy by 540. Subsequently, Emperor Justinian <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> Belisarius. The commanders left behind soon started squabbling with each other, while the Goths rallied their forces. Under the leadership of their charismatic new king, Totila, they soon reversed the situation, overrunning the imperial forces. Not even the return of Belisarius could stem the Ostrogothic tide: by 550, the East Romans were left with a handful of coastal strongholds in the mainland, and in the spring of that year, Totila even invaded Sicily, the Romans' strategic base. Wishing to deny the Imperials easy access to Italy and the ability to land fresh troops or reinforce their outposts, Totila had also created a navy of 400 warships to contest the seas with the Empire. At the same time, Justinian prepared one last major effort to reclaim Italy, under the eunuch Narses.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched {{the episode}} {{following}} {{the end of}} the series. Cast member Wil Wheaton reviewed it in April 2008 for AOL TV. He couldn't remember actually appearing in the episode, {{and it was the first}} time since it was originally broadcast that he had seen it. He said that it wasn't good, but that it was [...] "not as overtly racist as <b>I</b> <b>recalled.</b> I mean, it's certainly not as racist as [...] "Angel One" [...] is sexist, and if the Ligonians hadn't been arbitrarily determined to be entirely African American, it wouldn't have even been an issue." [...] He said that the episode is an example of the type of episodes in the first season that would have resulted in the show being cancelled mid-season if it hadn't been so well supported by the fans and run directly into syndication. James Hunt, whilst writing for Den of Geek, differed from Wheaton's assessment and asserted that the episode was racist. He said that [...] "this isn't just bad television, it's openly offensive, and it seems to do its best effort to undo some of the most important lessons the original series imparted some 25 years after we're supposed to have learned them." [...] Overall, he said that this was [...] "quite possibly the worst piece of Star Trek ever made".|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mostly positive reviews from television critics. In 2007, Patrick Enright of MSNBC called the episode his eighth {{favorite of the}} show. He praised the references to Terminator 2 in the episode, as well as Lisa's self-referential quote about how, [...] "by next week, we'll be {{back to where we}} started from, ready for another wacky adventure." [...] The authors of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, thought the episode had [...] "some great existential musings" [...] from Lisa. They added that it also [...] "contains some nice moments highlighting the differences between the Simpsons and the Flanders." [...] DVD Movie Guide's Colin Jacobson said: [...] "I always remembered [...] to be a great episode – and <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> correctly. Sure, the show goes with a less than creative presence; it’s an easy story to make characters behave in atypical ways. However, the development of the theme is terrific, as we learn the friendship of Homer Simpson is worse than the antagonism of Homer Simpson." [...] DVD Talk gave the episode a 4 out of 5 score. Patrick Bromley of DVD Verdict gave the episode a B grade, claiming the [...] "rather large dose of sentimentality" [...] and [...] "fewer moments of absurdity" [...] in the episode gave it [...] "the feeling that it belongs in one of the series' earlier seasons". The Orlando Sentinels Gregory Hardy named it the second best episode of the show with a sports theme.|$|E
5000|$|I {{was little}} girl when my father, Bill McCain was News Director at WAGA. Jim Bailey was the station Manager. As <b>I</b> <b>recall,</b> William {{was the name}} of the Janitor/guy Friday, errand runner. I used to ride around in the station's station wagon with him when he did errands. As <b>I</b> <b>recall</b> the dog [...] "WAGA" [...] was a black Scotty, not a Yorkshire terrier. Jon Farmer and his wife Phyllis were good family friends. They also had a ballroom dance show {{together}} (as <b>I</b> <b>recall)</b> that ran on Saturday evenings.. Source is myself..|$|R

2500|$|If I was {{to spend}} two years on the 16 {{paintings}} for Masquerade I wanted them to mean something. <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> how, as a child, I had come across [...] "treasure hunts" [...] in which the puzzles were not exciting nor the treasure worth finding. So I {{decided to make a}} real treasure, of gold, bury it in the ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it. The key was to be Catherine of Aragon's Cross at Ampthill, near Bedford, casting a shadow like the pointer of a sundial.|$|E
2500|$|The phrase [...] "Let them eat cake" [...] {{is often}} {{attributed}} to Marie Antoinette, {{but there is}} no evidence she ever uttered it, and it is now generally regarded as a [...] "journalistic cliché". This phrase originally appeared in Book VI of the first part (finished in 1767, published in 1782) of Jean-Jacques Rousseau's putative autobiographical work, Les Confessions: [...] "Enfin je me rappelai le pis-aller d'une grande princesse à qui l'on disait que les paysans n'avaient pas de pain, et qui répondit: Qu'ils mangent de la brioche" [...] ("Finally <b>I</b> <b>recalled</b> the stopgap solution of a great princess who was told that the peasants had no bread, and who responded: 'Let them eat brioche). Apart from the fact that Rousseau ascribes these words to an unknown princess, vaguely referred to as a [...] "great princess", the purported writing date precedes Marie Antoinette's arrival in France. Some think that he invented it altogether.|$|E
