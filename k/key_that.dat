In addition to Fast Lane access, this version provides priority access to haunted attractions within the park. It {{also includes a}} <b>key</b> <b>that</b> provides access to a secret room in each haunted attraction.|$|E
5|$|According to Microsoft sources, BitLocker {{does not}} contain an {{intentionally}} built-in backdoor; without a backdoor {{there is no way}} for law enforcement to have a guaranteed passage to the data on the user's drives that is provided by Microsoft. In 2006 the UK Home Office expressed concern over the lack of a backdoor and tried entering into talks with Microsoft to get one introduced, although Microsoft developer Niels Ferguson and other Microsoft spokesmen state that they will not grant the wish to have one added. Microsoft engineers have said that FBI agents also put pressure on them in numerous meetings in order to add a backdoor, although no formal, written request was ever made; Microsoft engineers eventually suggested to the FBI that agents should look for the hard-copy of the <b>key</b> <b>that</b> the BitLocker program suggests its users to make. Although the AES encryption algorithm used in BitLocker is in the public domain, its implementation in BitLocker, as well as other components of the software, are proprietary; however, the code is available for scrutiny by Microsoft partners and enterprises, subject to a non-disclosure agreement.|$|E
5|$|As of July 2016, Capital Bikeshare has two payment options: swiping {{a credit}} card at a dock or signing up online. At any dock, riders may {{purchase}} a single trip ($2), a 24-hour pass ($8), or a 3-day pass ($17), swiping {{a credit card}} at the station's kiosk to receive a code to unlock a bike. Online, riders may purchase passes for a month ($28) or a year ($85 if paid in one lump; $96 if paid in monthly increments of $8); these riders are mailed an RFID <b>key</b> <b>that</b> can unlock bikes without a code.|$|E

50|$|They {{may have}} {{illuminated}} <b>keys</b> so <b>that</b> a beginner {{can learn a}} piece by playing <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> are lit.|$|R
5|$|Once a {{particular}} level has been completed, the player {{is sent to}} the hub area, which features six portals to each of the individual levels and a gate that leads to the final boss. All the portals in the hub area, except for the first one, must be unlocked with <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> must be collected in the levels. The <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> unlock the portals to the second and third levels are found in the first level, the <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> unlock the portal to the fourth level are found in the second level, the <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> unlock the portal to the fifth level are found in the third level, and the <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> unlock the last level are found in the fourth and fifth levels. As a result, the game allows the player to complete certain levels in a nonlinear order. In the Nintendo 64 game, the player's progress can only be saved in special portals, while the Microsoft Windows version lets players save the game at any point. In these portals, the player may also fully restore Turok's health and ammunition once per level.|$|R
5|$|The current Boehm {{key system}} {{consists}} of generally 6 rings, on the thumb, 1st, 2nd, 4th, 5th and 6th holes, a register key {{just above the}} thumb hole, easily accessible with the thumb. Above the 1st hole, there is a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> lifts two covers creating the note A in the throat register (high part of low register) of the clarinet. A key {{at the side of}} the instrument at the same height as the A key lifts only one of the two covers, producing G a semitone lower. The A key can be used in conjunction solely with the register key to produce A/B.|$|E
5|$|The event {{opened with}} a Shop of Horrors match between Abyss and Black Reign, which lasted 10 minutes and 13 seconds. In a Shop of Horrors match, all weapons are legal to use, a wrestler can not be counted out, and {{it can only be}} won by pinfall or submission. James Mitchell {{interfered}} on Reign's behalf during the encounter. Abyss won the contest by pinfall after slamming Reign into the mat with his maneuver, the Black Hole Slam. After the encounter, Abyss grabbed a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> hung around Reign's neck and used it to open a locked building on the stage, which unknowingly was occupied by an unknown wrestler. Reign and the unknown wrestler then proceeded to lock Abyss in the building and push it off the stage.|$|E
5|$|The game then jumps {{five years}} forward. Nier {{and the others}} are trying to find the parts to a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> they believe will help them locate the Shadowlord and Grimoire Noir. After {{defeating}} five Shades and assembling the key, the team go to defeat the Shadowlord. There, Devola and Popola, characters who have been guiding Nier on his quest, appear to try to stop them. They explain that over 1300 years prior, humanity faced extinction due to an incurable disease. In an attempt to survive, they separated their souls from their bodies using Grimoire Noir and Weiss. They created clones resistant to the disease, Replicants, and intended to recombine the souls, or Gestalts, with the Replicant bodies once it had died out; Devola and Popola were androids set to oversee the project. Over time, the Replicants had begun to form their own identities; while the Gestalts, or Shades, had grown aggressive to them.|$|E

5|$|Most of Kanons {{development}} staff originally {{worked for}} the visual novel publisher Nexton under the brand Tactics. After {{the release of the}} brand's third game , most of Tactics' staff left Nexton to pursue work in another publishing company where they could have the freedom to produce their next game. Itaru Hinoue, who had previously worked at VisualArt's once before, introduced Key's founding members to the president of VisualArt's, Takahiro Baba. Baba gave the developers the freedom they desired, and they officially transferred to VisualArt's where they formed Key on July 21, 1998 and started production on Kanon. The planning for the visual novel was headed by Naoki Hisaya who was also one of two scenario writers with Jun Maeda. Hisaya wrote the scenarios for Ayu, Nayuki and Shiori, while Maeda wrote the routes for Makoto and Mai. Art direction was headed by Key's artist Itaru Hinoue who worked on the character design and computer graphics. Further computer graphics were split between three people—Dinn, Miracle Mikipon, Shinory—and background art was provided by Torino. The music in the game was composed by OdiakeS, Shinji Orito and Jun Maeda. Kanon was the first and last visual novel developed by <b>Key</b> <b>that</b> two of the main staff—Naoki Hisaya, and OdiakeS—worked on before pursuing a similar line of work in other visual novel studios.|$|E
5|$|The {{uprising}} {{was launched}} {{on the hot}} summer day of 2 August 1943 (Monday, a regular day of rest from gassing), {{when a group of}} Germans and 40 Ukrainians drove off to the River Bug to swim. The conspirators silently unlocked the door to the arsenal near the train tracks, with a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> had been duplicated earlier. They had stolen 20–25 rifles, 20 hand grenades, and several pistols, and delivered them in a cart to the gravel work detail. At 3:45p.m., 700 Jews launched an insurgency that lasted for 30 minutes. They set buildings ablaze, exploded a tank of petrol, and set fire to the surrounding structures. A group of armed Jews attacked the main gate, and others attempted to climb the fence. Machine-gun fire from about 25 Germans and 60 Ukrainian Trawnikis resulted in near-total slaughter. Lajcher was killed along with most of the insurgents. About 200 Jews escaped from the camp. Half of them were killed after a chase in cars and on horses. The Jews did not cut the phone wires, and Stangl called in hundreds of German reinforcements, who arrived from four different towns and set up roadblocks along the way. Partisans of the Armia Krajowa (Polish: Home Army) transported some of the surviving escapees across the river and others like Sperling ran 30 kilometres (19 miles) and were then helped and fed by Polish villagers. Of those who broke through, around 70 are known to have survived {{until the end of the}} war, including the future authors of published Treblinka memoirs: Richard Glazar, Chil Rajchman, Jankiel Wiernik, and Samuel Willenberg.|$|E

25|$|From a {{security}} standpoint, SSL 3.0 {{should be considered}} less desirable than TLS 1.0. The SSL 3.0 cipher suites have a weaker key derivation process; half of the master <b>key</b> <b>that</b> is established is fully dependent on the MD5 hash function, which is not resistant to collisions and is, therefore, not considered secure. Under TLS 1.0, the master <b>key</b> <b>that</b> is established depends on both MD5 and SHA-1 so its derivation process is not currently considered weak. It {{is for this reason}} that SSL 3.0 implementations cannot be validated under FIPS 140-2.|$|E
25|$|On {{mechanical}} Dutch typewriters, {{there is}} a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> produces 'ij' (in a single letterspace, located directly {{to the right of}} the L). However, this is not the case on modern computer keyboards.|$|E
25|$|Typewriters {{and early}} {{computers}} have traditionally {{had only a}} limited character set, often having no <b>key</b> <b>that</b> produces a dash. In consequence, it became common to substitute the nearest available punctuation mark or symbol. Em dashes are often represented in British usage by a single hyphen-minus surrounded by spaces, or in American usage by two hyphen-minuses surrounded by spaces.|$|E
50|$|To {{prevent that}} risk, {{one can use}} <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> are {{statistically}} independent for each layer (e.g. independent RNGs).|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Major {{and minor}} <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> {{share the same}} key {{signature}} are paired as relative-minor and relative-major keys.|$|R
5000|$|Many {{keyboards}} include <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> do {{not correspond}} to any ASCII printable or control character, for example cursor control arrows and word processing functions. The associated keypresses are communicated to computer programs by one of four methods: appropriating otherwise unused control characters; using some encoding other than ASCII; using multi-character control sequences; or using an additional mechanism outside of generating characters. [...] "Dumb" [...] computer terminals typically use control sequences. Keyboards attached to stand-alone personal computers made in the 1980s typically use one (or both) {{of the first two}} methods. Modern computer keyboards generate scancodes that identify the specific physical <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> are pressed; computer software then determines how to handle the <b>keys</b> <b>that</b> are pressed, including any of the four methods described above.|$|R
25|$|After a {{character}} is struck on the paper, the mechanism is reset, including replacing all latches on their bails and moving the interposer back into position. If the <b>key</b> <b>that</b> was pressed is still down at this time, the interposer rotates the keylever pawl {{out of the}} way to prevent key repeat until the key is released and depressed again, starting the next cycle.|$|E
25|$|Because {{keyboards}} {{have only}} a limited number of keys, English keyboards do not have keys for accented characters. The concept of dead key, a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> modified the meaning of the next key press, was developed to overcome this problem. This acute accent key was already present on typewriters where it typed the accent without moving the carriage, so a normal letter could be written on the same place.|$|E
25|$|Once {{the length}} of the key is known, the {{ciphertext}} can be rewritten into that many columns, with each column corresponding to a single letter of the key. Each column consists of plaintext that has been encrypted by a single Caesar cipher; the Caesar key (shift) is just the letter of the Vigenère <b>key</b> <b>that</b> was used for that column. Using methods similar to those used to break the Caesar cipher, the letters in the ciphertext can be discovered.|$|E

Soon it is not only Peter who is seeing visions, and the whole family {{witnesses}} an ancient battle on Borth Bog, although they do not realize what is happening.|$|E
25|$|Fibers are {{terminated}} in connectors {{that hold}} the fiber end precisely and securely. A fiber-optic connector is basically a rigid cylindrical barrel surrounded by a sleeve that holds the barrel in its mating socket. The mating mechanism can be push and click, turn and latch (bayonet mount), or screw-in (threaded). The barrel is typically free to move within the sleeve, and may have a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> prevents the barrel and fiber from rotating as the connectors are mated.|$|E
25|$|During Halloween Haunt, {{a similar}} system named 'Fright Lane' is sold. Essentially {{the same purpose}} as Fast Lane, it {{significantly}} reduces wait time of select haunted attractions. 'Fright Lane+' includes a 'Skeleton Key', a <b>key</b> <b>that</b> grants you special access to secret, intense rooms in six of the eight haunted houses. In addition, you receive special seating for Ed Alonzo's Psycho Circus of Magic and Mayhem.
