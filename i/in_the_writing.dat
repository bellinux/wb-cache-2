5|$|Because of {{regulations}} {{imposed by the}} Writers Guild of America, only those employed as writers for Saturday Night Live were allowed to write sketches for the program. Henson and his puppeteers merely performed the scripts for the segments—they were not involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> process. Saturday Night Live cast members did not enjoy working with The Land of Gorch segments. Writing assignments for The Land of Gorch sketches were given to Saturday Night Live staff as a penalty for being the least-liked among the production team. Writers generally regarded the routines as childish.|$|E
5|$|Fang was {{originally}} scripted to be a male character {{during the early}} stages of Final Fantasy XIIIs development, but early <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> stage, was rewritten as a female character. Along with this, the sex appeal that {{was originally}} {{going to be part of}} Lightning's look was transferred to Fang to give Lightning a more hard-edged persona. Fang is voiced by Rachel Robinson in English, and Mabuki Andou in Japanese.|$|E
5|$|I was in Russia, then Germany, {{and spent}} a lot of time in Eastern Europe. There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record.

5|$|In Mongolia, the Khalkha dialect, {{written in}} Cyrillic (and {{at times in}} Latin for social networking), is predominant, while in Inner Mongolia, the {{language}} is dialectally more diverse and is written in the traditional Mongolian script. In the discussion of grammar to follow, the variety of Mongolian treated is Standard Khalkha Mongolian (i.e., the standard written language as formalized <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> conventions and in the school grammar), but {{much of what is}} to be said is also valid for vernacular (spoken) Khalkha and for other Mongolian dialects, especially Chakhar.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} days of U2, his {{contributions}} to the band were often limited to fills and drum rolls, but he became more involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of the songs later, particularly in conjunction with Adam Clayton, his partner in the rhythm section, with whom he has collaborated on solo projects. When the band was first being signed to CBS Records, they refused to sign the band unless Mullen was fired. He was not, and as a result, his drumming became more integrated into the song structures. His experiences in the Artane Boys Band reportedly heavily contributed to the martial beat featured in many of U2's songs, helping to evoke military imagery.|$|E
5|$|Tolkien {{at first}} {{intended}} The Lord of the Rings to be a children's tale {{in the style}} of The Hobbit, but it quickly grew darker and more serious <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing.</b> Though a direct sequel to The Hobbit, it addressed an older audience, drawing on the immense backstory of Beleriand that Tolkien had constructed in previous years, and which eventually saw posthumous publication in The Silmarillion and other volumes. Tolkien's influence weighs heavily on the fantasy genre that grew up after the success of The Lord of the Rings.|$|E

5|$|Common Sense Realism {{not only}} {{dominated}} Scottish thought but {{also had a}} major impact in France, the United States, Germany and other countries. Victor Cousin (1792–1867) {{was the most important}} proponent in France, becoming Minister of Education and incorporating the philosophy into the curriculum. In Germany the emphasis on careful observation influenced Humboldt's ideas about science and was {{a major factor in the}} development of German Idealism. James McCosh (1811–94) brought Common Sense Realism directly from Scotland to North American in 1868 when he became president of Princeton University, which soon became a stronghold of the movement. Noah Porter (1811–92) taught Common Sense Realism to generations of students at Yale. As a result, it would be a major influence on the development of one of the most important offshoots of Romanticism in New England, Transcendentalism, particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of Ralph Waldo Emerson (1803–82).|$|E
5|$|Griffiths {{sought a}} {{historical}} origin for the Horus–Set rivalry, and he posited two distinct predynastic unifications of Egypt by Horus worshippers, similar to Sethe's theory, {{to account for}} it. Yet the issue remains unresolved, partly because other political associations for Horus and Set complicate the picture further. Before even Upper Egypt had a single ruler, two of its major cities were Nekhen, in the far south, and Naqada, many miles to the north. The rulers of Nekhen, where Horus was the patron deity, are generally believed to have unified Upper Egypt, including Naqada, under their sway. Set was associated with Naqada, so {{it is possible that}} the divine conflict dimly reflects an enmity between the cities in the distant past. Much later, at the end of the Second Dynasty (c. 2890–2686 BCE), King Peribsen used the Set animal in writing his serekh-name, in place of the traditional falcon hieroglyph representing Horus. His successor Khasekhemwy used both Horus and Set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of his serekh. This evidence has prompted conjecture that the Second Dynasty saw a clash between the followers of the Horus-king and the worshippers of Set led by Peribsen. Khasekhemwy's use of the two animal symbols would then represent the reconciliation of the two factions, as does the resolution of the myth.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an experiment {{on the effects}} of learning, mode of interaction (written vs. spoken) and transfer mode on user performance and discourse organization during interaction with a natural language dialogue system. Forty-eight participants took part in a series of twelve dialogues with an information retrieval system presented either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> or <b>the</b> spoken mode during the first six dialogues. The next six dialogues were then presented either <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same interaction mode or <b>in</b> another mode. <b>The</b> analysis of the results showed that performance (time, number of effective turns) improved throughout the dialogues whatever the mode of interaction. Nevertheless, performance was higher <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> mode. Moreover, mode-specific characteristics were observed. These consisted in greater use of subject pronouns and articles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spoken mode. Similarly, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spoken mode, the users found it easier to re-use <b>the</b> formulations presented <b>in</b> <b>the</b> system speech than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> mode. Furthermore, <b>the</b> analysis also revealed a positive transfer effect on performance and discourse organization when the individuals first interacted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spoken mode and then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> mode. Both positive and negative transfer effects were observed when the individuals interacted first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>written</b> mode followed by the spoken mode. The implications of the results are discussed in terms of direct and indirect consequences of modality effects on natural language dialogue interaction...|$|R
5|$|In {{the third}} segment, Burns and Smithers {{go down to}} the lab during Homer's nightmare. The animators decided to make the {{animation}} a bit more impressive, and decided to do the concave and convex images of Burns and Smithers. Even though it was tough and took up more time, the producers felt that it was a necessary tour-de-force. Originally, Homer's robotic voice was done post-animation in order to avoid stress on the voice actor. One of the writers who created the Davy Crockett joke thought it was so funny that he actually mimicked the actions of Mr. Burns putting on Homer's brain <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> room; the producers thought that it was hilarious, so they decided to add it into the episode.|$|E
5|$|On June 29, 2014, in an {{interview}} to Totalrock radio, Duff McKagan talked to Hayley Leggs in Clisson France about {{the subject of a}} new lead vocalist for Velvet Revolver and revealed that there had been at least one audition for the role of lead vocalist, but said that the person that they auditioned did not properly impress the remaining members of the band. He also ruled himself out of being the lead vocalist of Velvet Revolver due to the experiences he has had of being the vocalist of his own band Loaded, saying that being the lead vocalist and being a bass player at the same time was not as appealing to him because it would require him to be much more static in his stage presence, saying that he prefers moving around on stage during live performances. In the same interview, McKagan talked about his new book which was then <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> stages.|$|E
5|$|This led {{to further}} {{complications}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> process. For a few days, {{it was thought}} that Monk and Dr. Kroger would work to solve the case, but upon realizing that Monk {{would not be able to}} go back to a clinical detachment with Dr. Kroger, they eliminated this idea. So instead, Dr. Kroger does appear in more scenes than he normally does, but he stays out of the investigation scenes. As a result, Monk and Dr. Kroger do not break into Francis Merrigan's office to snoop around, though that would have been the typical thing to do if someone else were there. Rather, they simply peer through the sliding glass door that opens from Merrigan's office into the courtyard.|$|E

5|$|Varno later filed {{a second}} {{arbitration}} upon learning that Gene Corman was to receive writing {{credit for the}} original story. Varno claimed Corman {{had nothing to do}} with the story, and produced large amounts of dated notes he claimed proved he wrote it himself. Varno won both arbitration matters. However, Roger Corman refused to pay Varno, and as a result he was not allowed to use Writers Guild of America members on his films. Corman used non-union writers for several years, but he finally agreed to pay Varno when he wanted to use a union writer on one of his films. Varno said he would have sought more money for the delay, but he was out of the country when Corman paid the money and missed his opportunity. Additionally, despite winning arbitration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> credit matter, Gene Corman was given on-screen original story credit in Night of the Blood Beast. When contacted by the distributor, American International Pictures, he was told removing Corman's credit would mean recalling all of the prints and changing them, which would have cost thousands of dollars, and Varno agreed to allow it to remain unchanged.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli became deeply {{involved}} in English church politics. In 1550, he and Martin Bucer provided recommendations to Cranmer for additional changes to the Book of Common Prayer Eucharistic liturgy. Vermigli supported the church's position in the vestarian controversy, over whether bishop John Hooper {{should be forced to}} wear a surplice. Vermigli agreed with Hooper's desire to rid the church of elaborate garments, but he did not believe they were strictly prohibited. He advised Hooper to respect the authority of his superiors. Vermigli was probably instrumental in convincing Hooper to drop his opposition in February 1551. In October 1551 he participated in a commission to rewrite the canon law of England. In the Winter he assisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> of a draft set of such laws, which was published by John Foxe as Reformatio legum ecclesiasticarum in 1552.|$|E
5|$|While HBO {{entertainment}} president Carolyn Strauss felt Carnivàle {{had come}} to a natural end with its second season and gave this as the network's explanation for not renewing Carnivàle, it was reported HBO president Chris Albrecht had originally wanted to conclude the second season of Carnivàle with a satisfying and close-ended confrontation between Brother Justin and Ben. Albrecht allegedly preferred a definite demise of Brother Justin to a cliffhanger, but show creator Daniel Knauf stated Albrecht might have been misquoted. According to Knauf, Albrecht had wished in preproduction discussions to conclude season 2 with a fight between Brother Justin and Ben, which had always been Knauf's intention. HBO had then approved the open ending by greenlighting the final scene <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>writing</b> phase, budgeting the filming including the final shot, and owning the rights of the final cut of all episodes. There was never a plan to cancel Carnivàle prematurely, and HBO had only decided the cancellation shortly before their announcement. However, Clancy Brown (Brother Justin) remembers the original last shot of the series as Iris watching the corn die, not of Ben in Management's trailer.|$|E
