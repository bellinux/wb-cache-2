40|$|It is {{reported}} that <b>carbonized</b> <b>grains</b> {{of rice and}} ancient earthen vessels, which were measured to be 10, 000 years old, had been discovered from the cave ruins in Hunan province and Jiangxi province in the basin of the Yanzi. Moreover, the sites of agricultural villages were found from the Pengtoushan ruin and the Bashidang ruin near the shoreline of Dongting Lake. Enormous remains of agricultural and daily instruments had been discovered from the sites as well as <b>carbonized</b> <b>grains</b> of rice, which were measured to be some 7, 000 ～ 8, 000 years old. These discoveries indicate the facts that 1) the rice crop agriculture had been gradually wide spread in this area since about 6, 000 ～ 7, 000 years ago, and 2) Japonica type of rice co-existed with Indica type of rice {{which was supposed to}} be relatively older type of rice at that time. As the size of agricultural villages grew bigger sustained by the harvest from rice field about 4, 500 years ago, the gap between {{the rich and the poor}} became larger and the prototype of large castle city appeared.

Here we report ancient starch <b>grains</b> recovered from <b>carbonized</b> residues adhering to the bases of flat-bottomed vessels excavated from the Zhuannian site dating more than 10, 000 cal a BP in the North China Plain. This evidence demonstrates that early pottery was being used to cook cereal grains, particularly millets, and acorns.

Anent Agriculture of the Saltovskaya Culture Tribes (on the {{materials}} {{of the settlement}} of Rogalik) Despite records of findings of cultivated plants in materials of settlements of Saltovskaya culture in scientific literature, to this day they were not investigated credibly. In this connection a unique finding of <b>carbonized</b> <b>grains,</b> total weight about 30 kg, in the settlement of Rogalik, Lugansk district (archeological excavation made by K. I.

It is possible that millet Panicum miliaceum has been the third important white straw crop: The findings in Rogalik expand the list of places where grains of bottle-shaped barley were found. It is obvious that these were needs of animal husbandry that forced the inhabitants of Rogalik to take up agriculture...|$|R

40|$|Abstract On sites {{all over}} West-Frisia {{circular}} structures have been found. There {{are two types}} of these; pit circles and circular ditches. Both types are very similar and are found in round, oval, figure 8 and cloverleaf shapes. Their dimensions are very similar; an average diameter of approximately 4 m, an average depth of 25 cm and an average width of 25 cm {{and some of them are}} closed and others interrupted. They usually contain very few finds if any. What was the function of these circular structures in West-Frisia during the Bronze Age? The hypothesis was that they were used for the temporary storage of grain and possible other crops. This was concluded in an article called ‘cereal in circles’ by Buurman in 1979 and was based on a hypothesis from Bakker (1967; 1977; 2004). Their hypothesis is based on very little data; just a handful of sites with <b>carbonized</b> <b>grain.</b> It seems to be based mainly on an old landscape model and circumstantial evidence. Because of the project ‘Farmers of the coast’, old data is now being reviewed. It has risen some doubt on earlier findings, including this ‘cereal in circles’ hypothesis. Since the 1970 ’s a lot of new excavations have taken place and some of the old data that was never published has now been digitized. The data from those new excavations more or less confirm the old data. But that also means that there is still no evidence for grain as well. That means that now (2013) over a thousand circular structures have been excavated with just a handful of them containing <b>carbonized</b> <b>grain,</b> which does not really proof the storing of grain anyway. Although there is no real proof against the existing hypothesis, there is in my opinion now enough data not confirming the old theory that there should be at least doubt. It seems unlikely that all the circular structures held the same function. It is quite possible that the circular structures in West-Frisia were used for multiple purposes, which would explain all the different shapes and sizes. The most likely explanation would be that they were simply drains, but that does not explain why they are not found in the Late Bronze Age. All in all it is clear that the true function of the circular structures in West-Frisia during the Bronze Age is still an enigma and therefore a lacuna in our knowledge of this area. Only future research and excavations may solve this mystery. ...|$|R
40|$|Soft brown coals of {{the open}} coal fields of Kolubara and Kostolac are the main {{domestic}} energy sources of Serbia. This paper {{presents the results of}} investigations on rapid devolatilization of these two coals which have covered kinetics of devolatilization (based on total volatile yield), forms of sulphur and petrographic analysis of coal and char. Experiments of devolatilization were performed in inert gas (N 2) at atmospheric pressure and in batch-type hot-wire screen reactor. The mass-loss values of both coals at selected final reaction temperatures (300 - 900 °C) and retention times (3 - 28 s) were obtained. Anthony and Howard's kinetic model was applied over two temperature ranges (300 - 500 and 700 - 900 °C). The types of sulphur as monosulphide, sulphate, pyritic, and organic sulphur were determined for chars and original coals. Strong transformation of pyrite was evident even at low temperatures (300 °C). Devolatilization of all types of sulphur has started over 600 and at 900 °C the content of sulphur in char remained only 66 % of total sulphur in original coal. Microscopic investigations were carried out on samples prepared for reflected light measurements. The petrographic analysis included: the ratio of unchanged and changed coal, maceral types, the share of cenosferes, isotropic mixed <b>carbonized</b> <b>grains,</b> mixed grains, small fragments, clay, and pyrite. The change of the structure of devolatilized coal was also observed...|$|R
5000|$|Tell Aswad {{occupies}} a special {{location in the}} central Levant as a connecting region between northern and southern expansions of agriculture. Apparently a stronger trade relation is present to the southern cultures, although they had many things {{in common with the}} cultures that existed in the northern Levant. It is an example of one of the oldest sites of agriculture with domesticated emmer wheat dated by Willem van Zeist and his assistant Johanna Bakker-Heeres to 8800 BC. Peter Akkermans and Glenn Schwatrz suggested on this evidence that Tell Aswad shows [...] "the earliest systematic exploitation of domesticated cereals (emmer wheat) c. 9000-8500 BC". They suggest that the arrival of domesticated grain came from somewhere in the vicinity of [...] "the basaltic highlands of the Jawlan (Golan) and Hawran". The claim is based on the discovery of enlarged grains, absences of wild grains and on the presumption that the site was beyond the usual habitat of the wild variety of emmer wheat. The earliest postulated evidence for einkorn wheat at Jericho was not dated until at least five hundred years later than Aswad's emmer. Flax seeds were also present. Fruit, figs and pistachios, were apparently very popular because they were found in large quantities. Stationary containers of mud and stone were found with <b>carbonized</b> <b>grain</b> found on the interior of one designating them as silos. Finally, reeds were widely used, especially as reinforcement in the architecture, but also for mats and baskets and perhaps as bedding or fodder.|$|R
40|$|Tell Kashkashok is {{situated}} about 20 km northwest of Hasake {{city in the}} northeast of Syria. It {{is a group of}} four tells, {{and is one of the}} sites that will be flooded by the construction of the Hasake east dam. The tallest tell, tell no. III, was excavated by Dr. Antoine Suleiman of the Aleppo Museum. The University of Tokyo carried out the excavations of tell no. II from 6 May to to August 1978. The purpose of the excavations was to throw a new light on Hassuna la culture which was found in Iraqi Mesopotamia at several sites. In the beginning, it was hoped that the layer [s] of Hassuna Ia culture would be easily reached. The presence of Ubaid to Uruk period layers, however, obstructed this hope. After the struggle with many tombs, only one pit house (P 9) of Hassuna Ia was dug by the end of the season. The pit house is oval in shape, with a longer axis of ca. 4 m and a shorter axis of ca. 3 m. A hearth of 1. 3 m by 0. 9 m was found at northern corner of the floor. The pit house yielded many kinds of objects similar to those found in Iraqi Mesopotamia. In addition to such objects, <b>carbonized</b> <b>grains</b> and animal bones were also collected in quantity. The information obtained from this season's work is as follows: First, this small tell was inhabited by the Hassuna Ia people. Second, the tell was used as a cemetry in the Ubaid and Uruk periods. Finally this mound was used as a work place, for example for pottery making, in the Islamic age...|$|R
30|$|The Austronesian {{family is}} {{generally}} regarded as originating in a migration to Taiwan of fishing and farming groups from the mainland, c. 3500 – 3000 BCE. The proto-language first diversified in Taiwan; a migration out of Taiwan c. 2000 BCE resulted in the establishment, perhaps in the Philippines, of an Austronesian language (‘Proto-Malayo-Polynesian’) ancestral to all the Austronesian languages outside of Taiwan. Knowledge of rice by the proto-Austronesians is widely recognized by linguists based on three reconstructed items: proto-Austronesian *pajay ‘rice plant’, *Semay ‘rice as food’ and *beRas ‘husked rice’. The latter includes a monosyllabic root 1 *-Ras with meaning ‘fruit, flesh’ etc. implying that at some point, perhaps before proto-Austronesian (but conceivably still in proto-Austronesian), the meaning was ‘fruit, especially dehusked rice’. The Formosan vocabulary of millet has been under-recorded by investigators: {{it is possible that}} reflexes of *beRas mean ‘millet grain’ in more languages than is currently assumed. 2 Large quantities of <b>carbonized</b> rice <b>grains</b> were discovered in 2002 – 2003 at Nan Kuan Li, a lowland site on the west coast of Taiwan dated c. 2800 – 2200 BCE (Tsang 2005), confirming linguistic reconstructions. The same site has also yielded <b>carbonized</b> <b>grains</b> of the millet Setaria italica, again in large quantities. A term for S. italica, *beCeŋ, had been reconstructed to proto-Austronesian. The Nan Kuan Li site attests to co-cultivation of rice and S. italica by the early Austronesians on Taiwan as early as {{the first half of the}} third millennium BCE. Today western Austronesian peoples cultivate tropical japonicas and, in lowland locations, indica varieties. Both rice and millet were abandoned by the eastern (Oceanic) Austronesians as taro cultivation, arboriculture and increased reliance on fishing presented attractive alternatives. Japonicas dominate among the traditional landraces maintained by the Austronesians in Taiwan.|$|R
40|$|A PALAEOBOTANICAL STUDY OF THE WIJSTER SETTLEMENT The palaeobotanical {{investigation}} of the Wijster settlement comprises the following aspects: 1. Wood identification {{of a number of}} objects. The results of the identifications have been mentioned by Van Es in the description of the objects concerned, and they will not be repeated here. 1 2. Palynological {{investigation of}} a number of soil samples. 3. The investigation of a sample of <b>carbonized</b> <b>grain</b> (find no. 1239). A. PALYNOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION The following samples have been studied palynologically: 1. Humous layer (A-I horizon) of a heather podzol profile which was covered by drift sand (Section A 1, Fig. 5). Sample I must be older than the beginning of the settlement, since the latter was situated on top of the drift sand. II. Humous layer (A-I horizon) of a podzol profile, above which a layer of arable soil was present (Section C, Fig. 5). The old arable was cut by a foundation trench of the settlement. III. Spade mark from the westernmost field (Fig. I 81, III). IV. Spade mark from the easternmost field (Fig. 181, IV). V. Humous layer on top of arable soil which must be younger than the settlement, as it cuts through post holes of the latter (Section C, Fig. 5). VI. Humous layer on top of arable soil (Section F, Fig. 5). In Section F, which cuts across the fields mentioned above, the spade marks could be observed at the basis of the old arable. In the old arable a distinction could be made, at least locally, between the lower layer to which the spade marks belong, and an upper layer which must be correlated stratigraphically with the old arable of sample V. Sample VI was {{from the top of the}} upper layer. The results of the palynological investigation are represented in Table II. The values for the various pollen types are traditionally expressed as percentages of the tree pollen sum. The heather podzol profile of sample I corresponds stratigraphically with the blown-over podzol which could be observed below the burial mounds on the Emelange, ca. 500 m. east of the Wijster settlement. 2 Consequently, the spectrum of sample I agrees well with both spectra of the lower podzol on the Emelange. Only the Quercus (oak) percentage in sample I is lower than that in the corresponding Emelange spectra, but this can be the effect of a difference in pollen preservation. Sample I has been analysed in order to serve as a basis for comparison with the stratigraphically younger samples. As the position of sample II with respect to the settlement does not appear clearly from the section, sample III which undoubtedly belongs to the settlement will be discussed first. It would be logical to discuss samples III and IV, both from spade marks in fields from the last period of the settlement, together. However, as the pollen contents of sample IV must be considered to be abnormal to some degree, discussion of this sample will be postponed until later. A comparison between samples I and III shows that in spectrum III the Corylus (hazel) percentage is lower and that for Fagus (beech) markedly higher than in spectrum 1. Also the herbaceous percentages show considerable differences in both samples. In sample I Calluna (heather) constitutes by far the largest part of the nontree pollen. In sample III, on the other hand, apart fromCalluna, Gramineae (grasses) also show a high percentage. Triticum-(wheat) type pollen is relatively common, and a large number of herbs are represented. The tree pollen percentages in samples II and III agree fairly well with each other, suggesting that the difference in time between both samples could not have been very great. Sample II shows a high percentage for grasses, while the values for Plantago lanceolata (ribwort plantain), Rumex (sorrel) and Trifolium repens (white clover) are relatively high, indicating that before this surface became sealed off it was used as pasture land. The presence of Triticum-type pollen demonstrates that agriculture must have been practised in the immediate vicinity. As the humous horizon of the podzol profile on the spot of sample II was undisturbed, there cannot have been a field there at that time. It is very likely that the human activity which is clearly reflected in the pollen contents of sample II must be ascribed to the inhabitants of the Wijster settlement. [...] . Zie: Appendix...|$|R
