In NSCLC, samples are taken of nearby lymph nodes during surgery to assist staging. <b>If</b> <b>stage</b> II or III disease is confirmed, adjuvant chemotherapy improves survival by 5% at five years. The combination of vinorelbine and cisplatin is more effective than older regimens. Adjuvant chemotherapy for people with stage IB cancer is controversial, as clinical trials have not clearly demonstrated a survival benefit. Chemotherapy before surgery in NSCLC that can be removed surgically also appears to improve outcomes.|$|E

25|$|The <b>IF</b> <b>stage</b> {{includes}} a filter and/or multiple tuned circuits {{in order to}} achieve the desired selectivity. This filtering must therefore have a band pass equal to or less than the frequency spacing between adjacent broadcast channels. Ideally a filter would have a high attenuation to adjacent channels, but maintain a flat response across the desired signal spectrum in order to retain the quality of the received signal. This may be obtained using one or more dual tuned IF transformers, a quartz crystal filter, or a multipole ceramic crystal filter.|$|E

25|$|Usually the {{intermediate}} frequency {{is lower than}} the reception frequency fRF, but in some modern receivers (e.g. scanners and spectrum analyzers) a higher IF frequency is used to minimize problems with image rejection or gain the benefits of fixed-tuned stages. The Rohde & Schwarz EK-070 VLF/HF receiver covers 10kHz to 30MHz. It has a band switched RF filter and mixes the input to a first IF of 81.4MHz. The first LO frequency is 81.4 to 111.4MHz, so the primary images are far away. The first <b>IF</b> <b>stage</b> uses a crystal filter with a 12kHz bandwidth. There is a second frequency conversion (making a triple-conversion receiver) that mixes the 81.4MHz first IF with 80MHz to create a 1.4MHz second IF. Image rejection for the second IF is not a major problem because the first IF provides adequate image rejection and the second mixer is fixed tuned.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Hibberd had {{successfully}} {{built a new}} push–pull amplifier using two of the same tubes but working in the 1.25-meter band, an upper-VHF band (around 220MHz); below 1.25m the sensitivity dropped off sharply. Gerald Touch, originally from the Clarendon Laboratory, converted the EMI receiver to this wavelength by using the existing set as the intermediate frequency (<b>IF)</b> <b>stage</b> of a superheterodyne circuit. The original 45MHz frequency would remain the IF setting for many following radar systems. On its first test on 17 August, Anson K6260 with Touch and Keith Wood aboard immediately detected shipping in the English Channel at a range of [...] The team later increased the wavelength slightly to 1.5m to improve sensitivity of the receiver, and this 200MHz setting would be common to many radar systems of this era.|$|E

30|$|Nowadays, lots {{of radio}} systems {{and most of}} the {{spectrum}} analyzers are based on the super-heterodyne principle, i.e., the received signal is down-converted to a fixed intermediate frequency by the application of frequency mixing (or heterodyning). The conversion to an intermediate frequency is useful since filters can be set to a fixed frequency for which very sharp selective filters can be built. Furthermore, this makes them easier to tune and fewer stages for filtering are required when compared with the low-cost direct conversion (zero-IF) receivers which operate directly on the original radio carrier frequency. Due to the heterodyne principle the super-heterodyne radio comprises two stages: radio frequency (RF) and intermediate frequency (IF). Note that a super-heterodyne receiver can also be built of several <b>IF</b> <b>stages</b> to improve the radio reception; two or three <b>IF</b> <b>stages</b> are called double or triple conversion. However, these types of receivers are more costly and {{come at the expense of}} additional circuitry.|$|R

50|$|In FM systems {{where the}} <b>IF</b> <b>stage</b> gain {{is very high}} and the stage is {{designed}} to be linear, it is likely that if the unwanted signal is at least 10 dB weaker than the wanted signal that the capture effect will result in the receiver ignoring the unwanted signal. If however the unwanted signal is stronger than the wanted signal then {{it is likely that the}} receiver will be unable to demodulate the wanted signal. This is related to the normal method of jamming FM systems, to jam an FM signal it is normal to transmit a signal which is 10 dB stronger (at the front end of the target receiver) and is within the plateau of most narrow <b>IF</b> <b>stage.</b>|$|E
50|$|IQ {{imbalance}} is a performance-limiting {{issue in}} the design of direct conversion receivers, also known as zero intermediate frequency (IF) or homodyne receivers. Such a design translates the received radio frequency (RF, or passband) signal directly from the carrier frequency (fc) to baseband using only one mixing stage. The traditional heterodyne receiver structure needs an intermediate-frequency (<b>IF)</b> <b>stage</b> between the RF and baseband signals. The direct conversion receiver structure does not have an <b>IF</b> <b>stage,</b> and does not need an image rejection filter. Due to the lower component count, it is easier to integrate. However, a direct-conversion RF front-end suffers from two major drawbacks: one is IQ imbalance and the other is DC offset. When designing a homodyne receiver, control of IQ imbalance is necessary to limit signal demodulation error.|$|E
50|$|RSSI {{is often}} derived in the {{intermediate}} frequency (<b>IF)</b> <b>stage</b> before the IF amplifier.

50|$|A {{crystal filter}} is very {{often found in}} the {{intermediate}} frequency (IF) stages of high-quality radio receivers.
