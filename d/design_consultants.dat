25|$|The MTA, {{which had}} little {{experience}} in managing an undertaking {{of the scope}} and magnitude of the CA/T Project, hired a joint venture to provide preliminary designs, manage <b>design</b> <b>consultants</b> and construction contractors, track the project's cost and schedule, advise MTA on project decisions, and (in some instances) act as the MTA's representative. Eventually, MTA combined some of its employees with joint venture employees in an integrated project organization. This was intended to make management more efficient, but it hindered MTA's ability to independently oversee project activities because MTA and the joint venture had effectively become partners in the project.|$|E

25|$|Announced on 19 August 2013 by Changi Airport Group, a new mixed-use complex will be {{developed}} on the car park site fronting Terminal 1 (T1) and will optimise {{the use of the}} 3.5-hectare plot of land. Construction of the new facility began in December 2014. Named Jewel Changi Airport, the complex will offer aviation and travel-related facilities, a wide range of retail offerings, as well as unique leisure attractions. The redevelopment will also expect Terminal 1 to be expanded to allow more space for the arrival hall, baggage claim areas and taxi bays, enabling T1's passenger handling capacity to increase to 24 million passenger movements per annum. Changi will be working with CapitaMalls Asia on the concept and plans of Jewel Changi Airport. The completion of the complex would expect a joint venture partnership between Changi and CapitaMalls Asia to develop and manage Project Jewel. Jewel Changi Airport is also being designed {{with a view of the}} complex from both the Airport Boulevard and the sky. It will be designed by a consortium of <b>design</b> <b>consultants</b> led by architect Moshe Safdie, who designed Marina Bay Sands. A feature of the complex will be a large-scale indoor garden with a waterfall. To be connected to Terminals 1, 2 and 3, Project Jewel will serve as a node linking the three terminals, improving inter-terminal connectivity.|$|E

On 23 September 1993, the games were awarded to Sydney, but the following year Manchester submitted the same scheme design to the Millennium Commission as a [...] "Millennium Stadium", only to have this proposal rejected. Undeterred, Manchester City Council subsequently bid to host the 2002 Commonwealth Games, once again proposing the same site along with downsized stadium plans derived from the 2000 Olympics bid, and this time were successful. In 1996, this same planned stadium competed with Wembley Stadium to gain funding to become the new national stadium, but the money was used to redevelop Wembley.|$|E
500|$|The first section, {{from the}} M4 to {{junction}} 1, opened concurrently with that motorway in September 1966. The second section, through to junction 2, was a co-operative design between the Gloucestershire County Surveyor and the <b>design</b> <b>consultants</b> Freeman Fox & Partners. Construction {{was awarded to}} Sir Robert McAlpine, who began work in June 1968. The northern section {{was designed as a}} full-speed (...) motorway as far as Eastville, after which the motorway ran on an elevated section with a lower design standard. This section was opened by the Secretary of State for Transport, John Peyton in July 1970. The total cost was £3 million (now £ million). In 1972, a polystyrene storage depot on Muller Road near junction 2 caught fire, leading to the closure of the southbound M32 for six days.|$|E

500|$|The Chicago Theatre Preservation Group {{commenced}} {{renovation of}} the buildings which were completed in 1986 {{at a cost of}} $9 million ($ million), with $4.3 million ($ million) spent on the Theatre. The renovation by architects Daniel P. Coffey & Associates, Ltd. and interior <b>design</b> <b>consultants</b> A.T. Heinsbergen & Co. restored the Chicago Theatre to a 1930s appearance and a seating capacity of 3,600. [...] The theatre reopened September 10, 1986, with a performance by Frank Sinatra marking the culmination of a four-year historic preservation effort championed by the Landmarks Preservation Council of Illinois, [...] The gala reopening was also symbolic because Sinatra had performed at the theater in the 1950s. The restoration of the adjoining Page Building, itself a Chicago and National Register landmark, provided office space to support the theatre. The theater, like its neighbor the Joffrey Tower, is {{an important component of the}} North Loop/Theatre District revitalization plan. Theatre district revitalization plans go back as far as Mayor Jane Byrne's 1981 plan.|$|E
500|$|The {{property}} was originally a slaughterhouse before the donation took place, bordered {{on one side}} by Tudor City. While the United Nations had dreamed of constructing an independent city for its new world capital, multiple obstacles soon forced the organization to downsize their plans. [...] The diminutive site on the East River necessitated a Rockefeller Center-type vertical complex, thus, it was a given that the Secretariat would be housed in a tall office tower. During daily meetings from February to June 1947, the collaborative team produced at least 45 designs and variations. Rather than hold a competition {{for the design of}} the facilities for the headquarters, the UN decided to commission a multinational team of leading architects to collaborate on the design. The American architect Wallace K. Harrison was named as Director of Planning, and a Board of <b>Design</b> <b>Consultants</b> was composed of architects, planners and engineers nominated by member governments. The board consisted of N. D. Bassov of the Soviet Union, Gaston Brunfaut (Belgium), Ernest Cormier (Canada), Le Corbusier (France), Liang Seu-cheng (China), Sven Markelius (Sweden), Oscar Niemeyer (Brazil), Howard Robertson (United Kingdom), G. A. Soilleux (Australia), and Julio Vilamajó (Uruguay).|$|E
500|$|Wallace Harrison's assistant, {{architect}} George Dudley, later stated: [...] "It literally {{took our}} breath away {{to see the}} simple plane of the site kept open from First Avenue to the River, only three structures on it, standing free, a fourth lying low behind them along the river’s edge... also said, ‘beauty {{will come from the}} buildings being in the right space!’. The comparison between Le Corbusier’s heavy block and Niemeyer’s startling, elegantly articulated composition {{seemed to me to be}} in everyone’s mind..." [...] Later on, Corbusier came once again to Niemeyer and asked him to reposition the Assembly Hall back to the center of the site. Such modification would destroy Niemeyer’s plans for a large civic square. However, he finally decided to accept the modification: [...] "I felt [...] would like to do his project, and he was the master. I do not regret my decision." [...] Together, they submitted the scheme 23–32, which was built and is what can be seen today. Along with suggestions from the other members of the Board of <b>Design</b> <b>Consultants,</b> this was developed into project 42G. [...] This late project was built with some reductions and other modifications.|$|E

2500|$|Sustainability was {{a driving}} {{factor in the}} design of the library {{including}} use of an energy-efficient lighting system, maximization of natural lighting, and use of recycled materials. 1100 Architect, in collaboration with Atelier Ten, an international team of environmental <b>design</b> <b>consultants</b> and building services engineers, designed the library’s energy-efficient lighting system. The open plan layout and large use of glass allow for ample natural daylight year-round and low-energy LED light illuminates communal spaces. Recycled materials are incorporated into the design including carpet made from re-purposed truck tires, floors made from reclaimed window frame wood, and furniture made from FSC-certified plywood and recycled steel. Design features include a seemingly [...] "floating" [...] origami-style ceiling made up of triangular panels hung at varying angles and a padded reading nook fitted into the library's terrazzo-finished steel and concrete staircase. The interior uses an easy-to-navigate layout with its three distinct spatial areas of entry area, first floor space, and mezzanine visually unified through the ceiling.|$|E
2500|$|The third revised {{design was}} {{presented}} to the Commission of Fine Arts on July 17, 2008. Two firms had been hired by the memorial planners to assist the design team: Fluidity <b>Design</b> <b>Consultants,</b> which helped with the design of the star-shaped fountain; and Cloud Gehshan Associates, which worked on the glass panels and artworks. The first major change to the memorial design involved the star-shaped basin, which no longer overflowed into the triangular reflecting pool. Now the fountain overflowed itself, with water passing down its sides into a trough {{at the base of the}} structure. The overflow was designed to be a quiet one. The basin's underlying stone was no longer black granite, but the same grey granite as the rest of the plaza. The height of the star-shaped basin was also raised to [...] above the plaza, to make it a more visible and dramatic part of the memorial's design. (The height of the fountain permitted someone in a wheelchair to see the flame, but was also high enough to discourage a person from climbing into the water and approaching the flame.) The fountain was designed to be turned off in winter, although the basin would not be drained. A sensor system would detect if anyone climbed into the fountain's basin, and turn off the flame as a protective measure. The nature of the eternal flame had also been further refined. The new plan called for five stones to protrude slightly above the water. Just out of sight below the surface of the water, jets would allow natural gas to bubble to the surface. As the bubbles broke the surface, igniters hidden in the stones would cause the gas to burst into a [...] high flame. Sensors would adjust the flow of gas and the operation of the igniters to accommodate weather (such as wind or rain).|$|E
