50|$|El Cerro del Aripo lies on {{the border}} of the St.George and St.Andrew Counties in the biodiverse Northern Range. <b>Elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> and cloud forest is found on the peak's summit, due to high levels of {{rainfall}} and winds. <b>Elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> is also found on the summit of the nation's second highest peak, El Tucuche.|$|E
5000|$|Vegetation Type: Mature {{rainforest}} with Mountain Thicket & <b>Elfin</b> <b>Woodland</b> Ecosystem Distance: 10 km or 6 miles Estimated walking time: 9 hrs Climb: 1,005 mitres or 3,300 ft Type of hike: Very Difficult (strong hikers who {{are well}} trained) ...|$|E
50|$|It prefers {{open and}} dry {{habitats}} on southwardly directed slopes, margins of light spruce forest with interspersed rocks, margins of forest and scrubs in mountainous areas, {{as well as}} in <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland.</b> It has also been found in sub-alpine dwarf scrub.|$|E
50|$|Mangroves grow {{in coastal}} wetlands, which are called hydrophytic ecosystems. The {{vegetation}} at the coast are usually adapted to sandy soil. The montane forests and <b>elfin</b> <b>woodlands</b> grow on the cool, moist, mountainous regions.|$|R
50|$|Callophrys henrici, the Henry's <b>elfin</b> or <b>woodland</b> <b>elfin,</b> is a North American {{butterfly}} in {{the family}} Lycaenidae. In Canada it is found from southern Manitoba to southern Nova Scotia. It has two main groups of populations in the United States; the first is found along the Atlantic Coast and uses various hollies (Ilex) as host plants; {{and the second is}} found mainly in the north and the Appalachians where they use redbud (Cercis canadensis) as a host plant. Henry's elfin is increasing in New England because of an introduced buckthorn (Rhamnus cathartica) it now uses as a host plant.|$|R
50|$|The masked {{mountain}} tanager (Buthraupis wetmorei) is {{a vulnerable}} species of {{bird in the}} tanager family. This large and colourful tanager is endemic to <b>elfin</b> forest, <b>woodland</b> and shrub in the Andean highlands of southern Colombia, Ecuador and northern Peru. It is generally rare or uncommon, and is threatened by habitat loss.|$|R
50|$|On Trinidad, {{the species}} occurs in montane {{rainforest}} and <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> at around 940 m above sea level. On Cerro Humo, the species {{was found in}} the elfin forest near the summit of the mountain (1250 m). Phytotriades auratus is closely associated with the giant bromeliad Glomeropitcairnia erectiflora; also the tadpoles develop in these bromeliads.|$|E
50|$|Its {{summit is}} home to the Golden Tree Frog (Phyllodytes auratus). On the summit of El Tucuche, <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> can be found. The {{vegetation}} is usually gnarled and short, due to the high elevation, exposure to clouds and prevailing winds. At the foot of the mountain lies the village of Lluengo, home to some 2,000 residents.|$|E
5000|$|El Cerro del Aripo {{is home to}} {{the golden}} treefrog, only found in the highest peaks in Trinidad and the Paria Peninsula, Venezuela [...] The {{constant}} cloud cover, prevailing winds and Cloud Forest or <b>Elfin</b> <b>Woodland</b> provides a safe habitat for the elusive frog. It inhabits the moist bromeliads found on the summit. Other animals including the elusive ocelot, red brocket deer and howler monkey.|$|E
50|$|This species {{occurs in}} the north of the Blue Mountains and the John Crow Mountains, {{extending}} to the north-eastern coast of Jamaica. They are found at the attitudinal range is from sea level to 1,275m asl. It is found in mesic forests (montane rainforest, wet limestone forest, <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland)</b> in rocky areas of this region. The range is limited and its forest habitat is declining rapidly due to agriculture, human settlement, and logging. Eggs are laid on the ground and it breeds by direct development. The population of the species is decreasing and is threatened by habitat loss.|$|E
50|$|The hills rise {{abruptly}} {{from the}} lowlands of northern Trinidad (the so-called East-West Corridor), {{but only the}} two tallest peaks, El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche top 900 m. On the summits of El Cerro del Aripo and El Tucuche, the vegetation {{is quite different from}} the lower montane forests. <b>Elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> and cloud forests cover the summits, and are home to the endemic El Tucuche golden tree frog. The south-facing valleys run deep into the hills and support major rivers, such as the Caroni River, while the north-facing valleys are generally short and are drained by smaller streams.|$|E
50|$|Coral reefs cover almost 60% of the site’s marine area. A survey has {{revealed}} 168 species of finfish, 60 species of cnidaria, including corals, eight molluscs, 14 sponges, 11 echinoderms, 15 arthropods and eight annelid worms. The dominant terrestrial vegetation is tropical moist forest grading to subtropical wet forest, with small areas of dry forest and wet <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> on the summits. At least 148 plant {{species have been}} recorded on Gros Piton, 97 on Petit Piton and the intervening ridge, among them eight rare tree species. The Gros Piton is home to some 27 bird species (five of them endemic), three indigenous rodents, one opossum, three bats, eight reptiles, and three amphibians.|$|E
5000|$|The Mindanao horned frog is {{only found}} {{on the island of}} Mindanao in the Philippines. It is mostly found near a fresh water supply when it can lay its eggs or in dense underbrush, leaf litter, or other fallen object {{covering}} the ground. The climate of the ecoregion is tropical wet, with temperature and rainfall modified by the elevation, which reaches up to 2,700 meters. The vegetation in this area consists of hill dipterocarp forests, lower and upper montane forest, <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> (mossy forest) and summit grasslands. The area also experiences rainy seasons and frequent monsoons. June-October is the areas monsoon/rainy season, while in December-May there are [...] "trade winds" [...] which bring little rainfall, making it harder for the frog to find suitably wet places to breed.|$|E
40|$|We {{estimated}} the population {{density of the}} globally threatened Elfin-woods Warbler Setophaga angelae within two forest types at different elevations in the Luquillo Experimental Forest in north-eastern Puerto Rico. Population densities ranged from 0. 01 to 0. 02 individuals/ha in <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> and 0. 06 – 0. 26 individuals/ha in palo colorado forest in 2006, with average rates of decline since 1989 of 0. 002 – 0. 01 and 0. 003 – 0. 06 individuals/ha respectively. These estimates show a significant general declining trend from c. 0. 2 individuals/ha in 1989 in <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> to c. 0. 02 /ha in 2006, and from 1 to 0. 2 in palo colorado forest. Although variation in estimated population density depended on the statistical method used, we document and discuss possible causes of an overall population decline from 1989 to 2006, lending support to previous initiative...|$|E
40|$|The rock mass of fluvial and fluvioglacial {{deposits}} of the Late Holocene {{has been studied}} at the altitude of 1830 m a. s. l. using the palynologic, carpologic, geomorphologic, and geochronologic methods. It was ascertained that in the mid-Subatlantic period {{the area of the}} present-day beech <b>elfin</b> <b>woodland</b> was occupied by a belt of alpine meadows. Thus, the lower border of alpine meadows ran 370 - 400 m lower than the recent level, pointing to a rather significant cooling of the climate that occurred from ca 2 nd cent. A. D...|$|E
