Ybor would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> potential employees to leave established communities in Key West (and Cuba and New York) to help build a frontier settlement. While he enjoyed the goodwill of many Cuban tabaqueros because of his well-known support for ‘’Cuba Libre’’, that would not be enough.|$|E
500|$|Despite the film's {{repeated}} use of Disney's {{characters and}} iconography, Wu explained, trademark law was not sufficient. [...] "Disney {{does not have}} some kind of general intellectual-property right in Disney World itself." [...] To make a trademark-infringement case against Moore, he continued, Disney would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> a court that the use of its protected imagery in the movie could reasonably lead viewers to believe that it had a role in the film's production, and he did not think that was a plausible argument. [...] "The scene where a Disney Princess attempts to crush a child seems to eliminate that possibility." ...|$|E
500|$|Cosimo III {{considered}} compelling Gian Gastone {{to become}} a cardinal. In order to rally Gian Gastone to its cause, Spain, concerned that another Medicean cardinal—Gian Gastone's uncle, Francesco Maria de' Medici, Duke of Rovere and Montefeltro, already enjoyed that dignity—would tip the scales in favour of France at a Papal conclave, offered to create him [...] "General of the Spanish Seas". Peter II of Portugal, however, had other things in mind for him: he wanted Gian Gastone to marry his only daughter, Isabel Luísa, Princess of Beira. To marry her, Gian Gastone would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> his father to allot him an allowance of [...] "adequate stature". However, the Grand Duke refused and neither the cardinalate nor the Portuguese marriage ever materialised.|$|E

500|$|According to {{historian}} Knut Helle, Harald {{completed the}} first phase of what he has termed the [...] "national territorial unification of Norway". Having forced his way to the kingship, Harald would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the aristocracy that he was the right person to rule Norway alone. To establish domestic alliances, he married Tora Torbergsdatter {{of one of the most}} powerful Norwegian families. The primary opposition to Harald's rule would be the descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson, from the powerful dynasty of Earls of Lade who had controlled Northern Norway and Trøndelag with much autonomy under the Norwegian king. Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway (nominally under the Danish king) from 975 until 995, when he was killed during the takeover by Olaf Tryggvasson. Even after Haakon's death, his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north, and by Harald's early reign the family was headed by Einar Thambarskelfir, who was married to Haakon's daughter. While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus, Harald's absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar.|$|E

Eva Joly, {{who as a}} magistrate brought {{corruption charges}} against Strauss-Kahn (of which he was later acquitted) and was herself expected {{to run for the}} French presidency on the Europe Écologie-The Greens line, agreed that the images were [...] "very violent" [...] but noted that the American system [...] "doesn't distinguish between the director of the I.M.F. and any other suspect.

2500|$|As Hart and Mould {{developed}} as musicians and songwriters, an unspoken tension and competition {{arose in the}} band between them. Tensions were heightened when Mould demanded that starting with 1984's Zen Arcade that the band's records contain individual songwriter credits. In spite of the creative tensions, Hüsker Dü garnered critical acclaim {{with the release of}} Zen Arcade and subsequent albums. Michael Azerrad stated that by 1985's Flip Your Wig [...] "the two songwriters were trying their level best to outdo each other, and with spectacular results" [...] Hüsker Dü had left the hardcore genre behind, which caused some discomfort with their label at the time, SST Records. In one interview, Hart hinted that SST thought Hüsker Dü were [...] "soft" [...] because they stayed in motels while touring and occasionally wrote happy songs. Hart elaborated, [...] "We don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the world that we're suffering to convince them that we're artists... There's nothing wrong with being happy." ...|$|E

60|$|Marlborough House may be converted, I think, {{into a very}} {{handsome}} residence for the young Prince of Wales. The entrance from the court-yard is into a large, square central hall, the painted ceiling of {{which is at the}} whole height of the edifice, and has a gallery on one side, whence it would be pleasant to look down on a festal scene below. The rooms are of fine proportions, with vaulted ceilings, and with fireplaces and mantel-pieces of great beauty, adorned with pillars and terminal figures of white and of variegated marble; and in the centre of each mantel-piece there is a marble tablet, exquisitely sculptured with classical designs, done in such high relief that the figures are sometimes almost disengaged from the background. One of the subjects was Androcles, or whatever was his name, taking the thorn out of the lion's foot. I suppose these works are of the era of the first old Duke and Duchess. After all, however, for some reason or other, the house does not at first strike you as a noble and princely one, and you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> yourself of it by examining it more in detail.|$|E
