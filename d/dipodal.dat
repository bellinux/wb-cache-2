As in its isomer 3-pyridylnicotinamide, the nitrogen atoms on its pyridine rings can donate their electron lone pairs to metal cations, allowing it to bridge metal centers and act as a bidentate ligand in coordination polymers. [...] It is synthesized through the reaction of nicotinoyl chloride and 4-aminopyridine.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA {{library of}} bisphosphonate-based ligands was {{prepared}} using solution-phase parallel synthesis and tested for its uranium-binding properties. With {{the help of}} a screening method, based on a chromophoric complex displacement procedure, 23 <b>dipodal</b> and tripodal chelates bearing bisphosphonate chelating functions were found to display very high affinity for the uranyl ion and were selected for evaluation of their in vivo uranyl-removal efficacy. Among them, 11 ligands induced a huge modification of the uranyl biodistribution by deviating the metal from kidney and bones to liver. Among the other ligands, the most potent was the <b>dipodal</b> bisphosphonate 3 C which reduced the retention of uranyl and increased its excretion by around 10 % of the injected metal...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} {{synthesis}} and characterization of 10 novel polyamides containing the benzo- 18 -crown- 6 subunit and its <b>dipodal</b> counterpart, {{along with their}} properties, and a comparison with homologous polyamides bearing benzo- 12 -crown- 4, benzo- 15 -crown- 5, and the corresponding <b>dipodal</b> systems. The anomalous polymerization {{of some of the}} diacid monomers, that leads to insoluble gels under standard Yamazaki polymerization conditions, is described. The gel formation has been attributed to the threading of cyclic oligoamides with a growing polyamide chain to yield rotaxanes, polyrotaxanes, catenanes, or polycatenanes. Polyamide macrocycles have been characterized with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry. A route to avoid gel formation, consisting of a lower initial monomer concentration, is also described, along with the polymer properties of the polyamides obtained, including the chemical characterization, mechanical behavior, water sorption, morphology, diffusion data, and permeability of membranes prepared with these polymers. © 2006 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

40|$|The {{crystal and}} {{molecular}} {{structure and the}} stability of lead and calcium complexes of two chelates containing picolinate chelating groups in different geometries have been investigated in order to relate the ligand affinity and selectivity for lead over calcium with {{the ability of the}} ligand to accommodate a stereochemically active lone pair. The crystal structures of the lead complexes of the diprotonated and monoprotonated tripodal ligand tpaa 2 - show that the three picolinate arms of the tripodal ligand coordinate the lead in an asymmetric way leaving a gap in the coordination sphere to accommodate the lead lone pair. As a consequence of this binding mode, one picolinate arm is very weakly bound and therefore can be expected to contribute very little to the complex stability. Conversely, the geometry of the <b>dipodal</b> ligand H 2 dpaea is designed to accommodate the lead lone pair; {{in the structure of the}} [Pb(dpaea) ] complex the donor atoms of the ligand occupy only a quarter of the coordination sphere, reducing the sterical interaction between the lead lone pair with respect to the H 3 tpaa complexes. As a result, in the lead structures of H 2 dpaea all the ligand donor atoms are strongly bound to the metal ion leading to increased stability. The high value of the formation constant measured for the lead complex of the <b>dipodal</b> dpaea 2 - (log β 11 (Pb) = 12. 1 (3)) compared to the lower value found for the one of the tripodal tpaa 3 - (log β 11 (Pb) = 10. 0 (1)) provides direct evidence of the influence of the stereochemically active lead lone pair on complex stability. As a result, since the ligand geometry has little effect on the stability of the calcium complex, a remarkable increase in the Pb/Ca selectivity is observed for dpaea-(10 6. 6) compared to tpaa 3 - (10 1. 5), making the <b>dipodal</b> ligand a good candidate for application as extracting agent for the lead removal from contaminated water...|$|E
40|$|The {{reaction}} of mesoporous silica MCM- 41 with various aminopropylsilanes was investigated. The distribution of grafted amino groups after submonolayer deposition from anhydrous toluene was probed by fluorescein labeling {{in conjunction with}} photoluminescence spectroscopy and pore size analysis. Monoalkoxysilanes generally distributed more uniformly than monopodal and <b>dipodal</b> trialkoxysilanes. The outcome of the grafting reaction additionally depended {{on the nature of}} the amino group. Secondary amines grafted more efficiently than their primary analogues. Further, it could be shown that the polarity of the solvent considerably affects the distribution of the amino groups in the case of strongly interacting aminopropylsilanes...|$|E
40|$|The synthesis, anion binding, and {{conformational}} {{properties of}} a series of 3 -aminopyridinium-based, tripodal, tricationic hosts for anions are described. Slow anion and conformational exchange on the 1 H NMR time scale at low temperature, coupled with NMR titration, results in a high level of understanding of the anion-binding properties of the compounds, particularly with respect to significant conformational change resulting from induced fit complexation. Peak selectivity for halides, particularly Cl-, is observed. The approach has been extended to <b>dipodal</b> and tripodal podands based on 3 -aminopyridinium "arms" containing photoactive anthracenyl moieties. The 1, 3, 5 -tripodal host shows a remarkable selectivity for acetate over other anions, in contrast to the analogous unsubstituted tris(3 -aminopyridinium) analogue, despite the fact that low-temperature 1 H NMR experiments reveal a total of four acetate-binding conformations. Photodimerization of anthracene units results in the formation of potential fluorescent anion sensors...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{molecular}} stencil patterning (MSP) {{technique is}} a new surface molecular engineering technique developed for cation-templated porous silicas to graft several functions with vicinity control. First, tetramethylammonium ions (TMA+) are introduced by ion exchange of the cetyltrimethyl-ammonium template (CTA+). Then, the coverage is controlled to create a masking array of cations, the pattern of which is produced by mutual electrostatic repulsion. A first function is grafted, here monopodal trimethylsilyl groups (TMS) or <b>dipodal</b> ethyl- 1, 2 -bis(dimethylsilyl) (EBDMS) groups. After {{the removal of the}} masking cations, a second function is grafted using here N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -amino-propyltrimethoxysilane precursor. The distribution of N-(2 -aminoethyl) - 3 -amino-propylsilyl functions (AAPS) is probed by complexation to Cu(II) ions. X-Ray diffraction, N 2 adsorption–desorption isotherms, 13 C solid-state NMR, IR, UV-visible and electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) techniques show that MSP can produce isolation of AAPS by TMS, or even better by EBDMS groups, with preservation of the silica pore structure...|$|E
40|$|New palladium(II) bis(N-heterocyclic carbene) (NHC) {{complexes}} {{have been}} prepared via metallomacrocyclic AgI ligand transfer agents. Reaction of 1, 4 -bis(3 -isopropylimidazolium) xylene (1 a) hexafluorophosphate with Ag 2 O gives a AgI macrocyclic NHC complex in which two silver ions are sandwiched between two <b>dipodal</b> ligands (2 a). The NHC moieties adopt a cisoid conformation relative to one another. Upon transfer to palladium to give [{PdCl 2 (MeCN) } 2 (bis-NHC) ] (3 a) the NHC ligands in the complexes adopt a mixture of cisoid and transoid conformers in the solid state, which have been characterized by X-ray crystallography. In CD 3 CN solution the cisoid and transoid conformers interconvert and exhibit resonances for a single averaged form. DFT calculations indicate an interconversion barrier of 56 kJ[*]mol– 1. In CDCl 3 solution two different isomers are observed which have been assigned to isomers of a chloride-bridged dimer (4 a) following dissociation of the acetonitrile ligands...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{investigate}} the anion-binding properties of a range of different receptor compounds. For the most part, the receptors reported here were tripodal in nature, wherein three hydrogen-bonding receptor groups, including amines, amides and ureas, are linked around a common structural core. In this study, a range of different cores were chosen, such as simple and flexible organic frameworks based on the tris(2 -aminoethyl) amine (tren) precursor, conformationally-restricted and brightly coloured aromatic species based on the dye pararosaniline, and triply-ligated metal complexes of ruthenium(II). In order to assess the anion binding abilities of these receptors, a range of different techniques were employed, with 1 H-NMR and UV/Visible spectroscopic titrations being the most common. Additionally, the incorporation of fluorescent pyrene moieties as a reporter group to some of the receptors allowed for the probing of anion binding via fluorimetric titrations in these cases. During the course of the experiments, a number of interesting, and in some cases, unexpected, binding conformations were found – in particular, the interactions between many of the organic receptor compounds with the planar 1, 3, 5 -benzenetricarboxylate (trimesylate) trianion, and the pH dependency of the colour of the pararosaniline-based receptors. Additionally, the range of cyclic thioether-capped ruthenium(II) receptor compounds reported here showed an unusually high resistance to degradation by solvent and guest when compared to similar receptors with aromatic-capped ruthenium, and successfully gave tripodal ML 3 complexes instead of the traditionally more stable ML 2 X <b>dipodal</b> complexes. ...|$|E

The <b>dipodal</b> boron centred soft ligands Bb and BtMe were prepared in situ. The reactivity of [NaBb] (1) and [NaBt(Me) ] (2) towards Bi(III) ions has been studied. The resulting complex [BiBb(2) Cl] (3) contains an MS 4 core with kappa(3) -S,S,H coordination mode, while the complex [BiBt(3) (Me) ] (4) with an MS 6 core adopts a coordination mode. kappa(2) -S,S. A reaction of BiCl 3 with the heterocyclic precursors 2 -mercapto-benzimidazole (L- 1) and 2 -mercapto- 4 -methylthiazole (L- 2) was also attempted; this afforded the monomeric [(BiL 4 Cl 2) -Cl- 1][(BiL 2 Cl 4) -Cl- 1] (5) and dimeric [BiL 22 (mu-Cl) Cl](2) (6) bismuth complexes. The bismuth complexes possess distorted octahedral geometries except 3 for which a face-capped octahedron is found. The presence of (B) H center dot center dot center dot Bi interactions has been identified by X-ray diffraction in 3 with a H center dot center dot center dot Bi distance of 2. 58 (1) angstrom which is uniquely short and unprecedented. Two of the synthesized complexes (4 and 5) have been investigated by luminescence spectroscopy. They feature emission bands in the solid state at room temperature at 674 (4) and 586 nm (5), which are hypsochromically shifted in (frozen) ethanolic solutions at 77 K to 618 and 537 nm, respectively. ...|$|E

The reactions of Mn(ClO 4) 2 center dot 6 H(2) O, NEt 3, NaN 3, and either mdaH(2) or teaH(3) (1 : 2 : 1 : 2) in DMF/MeOH afford {[Na(MeOH) (3) ][MN 7 (N- 3) (6) (mda) (6) ]}(n) (1) and {Na[Mn- 7 (N- 3) (6) (teaH) (6) ]}(n) (2), respectively, whereas the 2 : 1 : 1 reaction of MnCl 2 center dot 4 H(2) O, mdaH(2), and NEt 3 in MeCN gives (NHEt 3) [Mn 7 Cl 6 (mda) (6) ] (3). Similar reactions using (NBu 4 N 3) -N-n in place of NaN 3 gave (NHEt 3) [Mn- 7 (N- 3) (6) (mda) (6) ] (4) and (NHEt 3) [Mn- 7 (N- 3) (6) (teaH) (6) ] (5). The Mn- 7 anions consist of a Mn- 6 hexagon of alternating Mn-II and Mn-III ions surrounding a central Mn-II ion. The remaining ligation is by six bridging and chelating mda(2 -) or teaH(2 -) groups, and either six terminal N- 3 (-) (1, 2, 4, 5) or Cl- (3) ions. Each bridging mda(2 -) or teaH(2 -) ligand contains both mu- and mu(3) -O atoms, resulting in a similar, near-planar [Mn- 7 (mu(3) -OR) (6) (mu-OR) (6) ](5 +) core for all three complexes. The Mn- 7 anions of 1 and 2 are connected via Na+ cations to yield one-dimensional zigzag chains and three-dimensional windmill-like "hexagons-of-hexagons", respectively. In contrast, the Mn- 7 anion of 3 forms a strong hydrogen-bond between the NHEt 3 + cation and a terminal Cl- ion giving a discrete ion-pair, Variable-temperature, solid-state direct current (dc) and alternating current (ac) magnetization studies were carded out in the 5. 0 - 300 K range. Fits of dc magnetization versus field (H) and temperature (T) data by matrix diagonalization gave S = 11, g = 1. 95, D = - 0. 15 cm(- 1) for 1, S = 16, g = 1. 95, D = - 0. 02 cm(- 1) for 2, and S = 11, g = 1. 92, D= - 0. 13 cm(- 1) for 3 (D is the axial zero-field splitting parameter). Complexes 4 and 5 were also found to possess S = 11 and S = 16 ground states, respectively. The different ground states of 1 and 2 were rationalized {{on the basis of}} the sign and magnitude of the various Mn- 2 exchange parameters obtained from density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This analysis confirmed the presence of spin frustration effects, with the ground states being determined by the relative magnitude of the two weakest interactions. The combined results demonstrate the usefulness of N-based <b>dipodal</b> and tripodal alkoxide-based chelates as a route to structurally and magnetically interesting Mn cluster...|$|E
