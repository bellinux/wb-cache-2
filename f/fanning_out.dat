5|$|The panzergrenadier {{regiment}} of Großdeutschland, advancing on {{the right}} wing, pushed through {{to the village of}} Butovo. The tanks were deployed in an arrow formation to minimise the effects of the Soviet Pakfront defence, with the Tigers leading and the Panzer IIIs, IVs and assault guns <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> to the flanks and rear. They were followed by infantry and combat engineers. Attempts by the VVS to impede the advance were repulsed by the Luftwaffe.|$|E
5|$|The 1st Brigade {{had just}} 33 tanks {{remaining}} after losing 20 tanks. This prompted Second Army command to transfer {{a battalion of}} 21 tanks on October 18 from the 2nd Infantry Division to the north to reinforce the dwindling tank numbers in 16th Division's bridgehead. As the battalion moved south, {{a large number of}} Israeli aircraft attacked the formation, forcing it to undertake evasive maneuvers, turning eastwards and <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> in the desert terrain, thereby avoiding losses. The battalion was then attached to the 21st Division.|$|E

5|$|When {{directly}} threatened, many mantis species {{stand tall}} and spread their forelegs, with their wings <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> wide. The fanning of the wings makes the mantis seem {{larger and more}} threatening, with some species enhancing this effect with bright colors and patterns on their hind wings and inner surfaces of their front legs. If harassment persists, a mantis may strike with its forelegs and attempt to pinch or bite. As part of the bluffing (deimatic) threat display, some species may also produce a hissing sound by expelling air from the abdominal spiracles. Mantises lack chemical protection, so their displays are largely bluff. When flying at night, at least some mantises are able to detect the echolocation sounds produced by bats; when the frequency begins to increase rapidly, indicating an approaching bat, they stop flying horizontally and begin a descending spiral toward {{the safety of the}} ground, often preceded by an aerial loop or spin. If caught, they may slash captors with their raptorial legs.|$|E
5|$|During 19 April, {{the fourth}} day, the 1st Belorussian Front {{broke through the}} final line of the Seelow Heights; and nothing but broken German {{formations}} lay between them and Berlin. The 1st Ukrainian Front, having captured Forst the day before, was <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> into open country. One powerful thrust by Gordov's 3rd Guards Army and Rybalko's 3rd and Lelyushenko's 4th Guards Tank Armies were heading north-east towards Berlin while other armies headed west towards {{a section of the}} United States Army's front line south-west of Berlin on the Elbe. With these advances, the Soviet forces drove a wedge between the German Army Group Vistula in the north and Army Group Centre in the south. By the end of the day, the German eastern front line north of Frankfurt around Seelow and to the south around Forst had ceased to exist. These breakthroughs allowed the two Soviet Fronts to envelop the German 9th Army in a large pocket west of Frankfurt. Attempts by the 9th Army to break out to the west resulted in the Battle of Halbe. The cost to the Soviet forces had been very high, with over 2,807 tanks lost between 1 and 19 April, including at least 727 at the Seelow Heights.|$|E

25|$|Indian attacks {{increased}} significantly after 1860, {{when most of}} the army troops were withdrawn, and miners and ranchers began <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> all over the country, often encroaching on Indian territory. Increased attacks along the Humboldt led to most travelers' taking the Central Nevada Route. The Goodall cutoff, developed in Idaho in 1862, kept Oregon bound travelers away from much of the Indian trouble nearer the Snake River. Other trails were developed that traveled further along the South Platte to avoid local Indian hot spots.|$|E

On 21 June, Wellington crossed the French frontier, moving the principal portion of his army to Bavay, and the remainder from Mons upon Valenciennes, which fortress was immediately blockaded; and established his headquarters at Malplaquet, on site of the Battle of Malplaquet where the Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene of Savoy had won a famous victory against the French a century before.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} {{thorough}} performance comparison of three widely used probabilistic gossip algorithms over well-known random graphs. These graphs represent some large-scale network topologies: Bernoulli (or Erdos-Rényi) graph, random geometric graph, and scale-free graph. In order to conduct such a fair comparison, particularly {{in terms of}} reliability, we propose a new parameter, called effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out.</b> For a given topology and gossip algorithm, the effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> characterizes the mean dissemination power of infected sites. For large-scale networks, the effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out</b> has thus a strong linear correlation with message complexity. It enables to make an accurate analysis {{of the behavior of}} a gossip algorithm over a topology. Furthermore, it simplifies the theoretical comparison of different gossip algorithms on the topology. Based on extensive experiments on top of OMNet++ simulator, which make use of the effectual <b>fan</b> <b>out,</b> we discuss the impact of topologies and gossip algorithms on performance, and how to combine them to have the best gain in terms of reliability...|$|R

25|$|Besides {{reversed}} {{values for}} index of refraction, Veselago predicted {{the occurrence of}} reversed Cherenkov radiation (also known simply as CR) in a left-handed medium. In 1934 Pavel Cherenkov discovered a coherent radiation that occurs when certain types of media are bombarded by fast moving electron beams. In 1937 a theory built around CR stated that when charged particles, such as electrons, travel through a medium at speeds faster {{than the speed of}} light in the medium only then will CR radiate. As the CR occurs, electromagnetic radiation is emitted in a cone shape, <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> in the forward direction.|$|E
25|$|Bernini's ingenious {{solution}} {{was to create a}} piazza in two sections. That part which is nearest the basilica is trapezoid, but rather than <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> from the facade, it narrows. This gives the effect of countering the visual perspective. It means that from {{the second part of the}} piazza, the building looks nearer than it is, the breadth of the facade is minimized and its height appears greater in proportion to its width. The second section of the piazza is a huge elliptical circus which gently slopes downwards to the obelisk at its center. The two distinct areas are framed by a colonnade formed by doubled pairs of columns supporting an entablature of the simple Tuscan Order.|$|E
25|$|First Presbyterian Church on Albert Street {{was built}} in 1926 by non-concurring dissidents from the various Presbyterian congregations {{in the city of}} Regina — notably from Knox Presbyterian-cum-United, led by Judge W.M. Martin, and from Westminster United — which had universally opted to enter the United Church of Canada in 1925. They built a fine, determinedly {{traditional}} church structure — with chancel, transepts and nave, as distinct from the Akron plan of Knox, Metropolitan, Westminster and First Baptist with pews <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> from a central pulpit backed by choir benches — which is much prized by musical and cultural groups in the city as an auditorium. The Institute for stained glass in Canada has documented the stained glass at First Presbyterian Church.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{refactoring}} is {{to reduce}} software complexity and hence simplify the maintenance process. In this paper, we explore the impact of refactorings on "FanIn" and "FanOut" coupling metrics through extraction of refactoring data from multiple releases of five Java open-source systems, We first considered how a single refactoring modified these metric values, what happened when refactorings had been applied to a single class in unison and finally, what influence a set of refactorings had on the shape of Fan In and <b>Fan</b> <b>Out</b> distributions. Results indicated that, on average, refactored classes tended to have larger FanIn and <b>Fan</b> <b>Out</b> values when compared with non-refactored classes. Where evidence of multiple (different) refactorings applied to the same class was found, the net effect (in terms of FanIn and <b>Fan</b> <b>Out</b> coupling values) was negligible...|$|R
25|$|The only {{remedy for}} {{this loss of}} control is to desaturate the CMGs by {{removing}} the excess angular momentum from the spacecraft. The simplest way of doing this is to use Reaction Control System (RCS) thrusters. In our example of saturation along the forward axis, the RCS will be fired to produce an anticlockwise torque about that axis. The CMG control program will then command the rotor spin axes to begin <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> away from the forward direction, producing gyroscopic torques whose resultant is clockwise about the forward direction, opposing the RCS {{as long as it}} is still firing and holding the spacecraft steady. This is continued until a suitable amount of forward angular momentum has been drained out of the CMG rotors; it is transformed into the moment of momentum of the moving matter in the RCS thruster exhausts and carried away from the spacecraft.|$|E
25|$|A diamond's fire is {{determined}} by the cut's crown height and crown angle (the crown being {{the top half of the}} stone, above the girdle), and the size and number of facets that compose it. The crown acts as a prism: light exiting the stone (after reflection from the pavilion facets) should meet the crown facets at as great an angle of incidence from the normal as possible (without exceeding the critical angle) in order to achieve the greatest <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> or spread of spectral colors. The crown height is related to the crown angle, the crown facet size, and the table size (the largest central facet of the crown): a happy medium is sought in a table that is not too small (which would result in larger crown facets and greater fire at the expense of brilliance) or too large (which would result in smaller crown facets and little to no fire).|$|E
25|$|Along the {{southern}} coast, Royal Australian Navy Fairmile motor launches began patrolling towards Wide Bay {{shortly before the}} new year as Japanese submarines had been spotted elsewhere, particularly on the north coast around Open Bay. In late December, two companies from the 14th/32nd Infantry Battalion, reinforced by a platoon from the 1st New Guinea Infantry Battalion, were sent east from Cutarp to Sampun, on {{the southern}} expanse of Wide Bay in late December, moving by barge. These forces were bolstered in early January {{with the arrival of}} the remaining two companies of the 14th/32nd, along with a troop of artillery from the 2/14th Field Regiment. Between late January and early February 1945, the Australian 6th Infantry Brigade advanced eastwards along the southern coast of New Britain towards Milim, where they established a patrol base with the intention of <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> towards Henry Reid Bay. Boomerang fighters and Beaufort fighter-bombers attacked Japanese positions to the north of Kalai Plantation on 15 February, and the 14th/32nd subsequently took the position unopposed after the Japanese defenders withdrew under heavy artillery fire. Two days later, the 14th/32nd took the trading station at Kamandram.|$|E

500|$|The exocrine {{group is}} {{dominated}} by pancreatic adenocarcinoma (variations of this name may add [...] "invasive" [...] and [...] "ductal"), which {{is by far the}} most common type, representing about 85% of all pancreatic cancers. Nearly all these start in the ducts of the pancreas, as pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). This is despite the fact that the tissue from which it arises – the pancreatic ductal epithelium – represents less than 10% of the pancreas by cell volume, because it constitutes only the ducts (an extensive but capillary-like duct-system <b>fanning</b> <b>out)</b> within the pancreas. [...] This cancer originates in the ducts that carry secretions (such as enzymes and bicarbonate) away from the pancreas. About 60–70% of adenocarcinomas occur in the head of the pancreas.|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} at Somerset, he was known for [...] " [...] a match with his {{cracking}} strokes in an hour."

In the best Somerset tradition, he was always after the bowling, and in the best Australian tradition, he always relished a fight." [...] But he also adapted his style to suit English pitches: in an early innings for Somerset, he was out trying to hook a ball from Trevor Bailey. [...] "The hook, he decided, was a stroke to be used sparingly on English pitches... McCool was constantly amending his technique that season , whenever he spotted a flaw in his method. Again and again he held the Somerset batting together. Nothing in his previous experience had equipped him for the task of holding up a losing side in a damp English summer." ...|$|E
500|$|At 14:40 a heavy shell {{exploded}} next to Sissoi Velikys bow, {{damaging the}} bow torpedo tube. Shortly afterward a 12-inch and a 6-inch shell hit the belt armour {{near the water}} line, causing flooding in the forward compartments. In the following hour the ship was hit by one 12-inch, three 8-inch and three 6-inch shells, which disabled her forward turret hydraulics, set the casemates afire and simultaneously severed the firefighting water supply. At 15:40 Ozerov steered the burning Sissoi Veliky away from {{the line of fire}} and joined the unengaged Russian cruiser formation. By 17:00 the crew had extinguished the fires and the ship returned to action with a heavy list to port. She took her place in line behind Navarin at the moment when the Japanese battleships ceased fire and the Russians hoped to leave the battlefield without further casualties. One hour later Admiral Kamimura re-established contact and engaged the fleeing Russians. Sissoi Veliky survived this phase of the battle unharmed. After sunset she joined the group of survivors assembled by Nebogatov, but was unable to keep pace with Nebogatov's flagship Imperator Nikolai I. Sissoi Veliky and Navarin fell back, supporting [...] with gunfire. At 19:30 the ship sighted Japanese destroyers <b>fanning</b> <b>out</b> for an attack.|$|E
