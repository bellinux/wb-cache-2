5|$|The Lady Chapel {{was built}} by William de Braose, bishop from 1266 to 1287. It was built {{at the rear of}} the church {{constructed}} by Urban and the old choir area was removed in order to build the chapel. From this time on, it seemed as if the cathedral was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of repair or alterations at a slow pace. After the Lady Chapel had been completed, the two bays of the north choir aisle were rebuilt.|$|E
5|$|The Frank Slide was a rockslide that buried part of {{the mining}} town of Frank, Northwest Territories, Canada at 4:10 am on April 29, 1903. Over 82 million tonnes (90 million tons) of {{limestone}} rock slid down Turtle Mountain within 100 seconds, obliterating {{the eastern edge of}} Frank, the Canadian Pacific Railway line and the coal mine. It was one of the largest landslides in Canadian history and remains the deadliest, as between 70 and 90 of the town's residents were killed, most of whom remain buried in the rubble. Multiple factors led to the slide: Turtle Mountain's formation left it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of instability. Coal mining operations may have weakened the mountain's internal structure, as did a wet winter and cold snap {{on the night of the}} disaster.|$|E
5|$|The terrans are a young {{species with}} psionic potential. The terrans of the Koprulu sector descend from the {{survivors}} of a disastrous 23rd century colonization mission from Earth. Compared to the protoss and zerg, the terrans are technologically inferior, lacking in genetic-diversity, and highly factionalized. The seven dominant government factions are the Moebius Foundation, the Kel-Morian Combine, the Tarsonis Republic, the Mar Sara Republic, the Terran Dominion, the Umojan Protectorate, and the United Earth Directorate. Terrans are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of conflict: whenever they are not caught in the two-front pitched battle crossfire with their alien neighbors' interstellar conflicts, they endure frequent assassinations, civil wars and revolutions amongst themselves. Nevertheless, terran ingenuity and unyielding stubbornness has kept them from extinction; they stand {{as one of the}} three dominant species of the galaxy.|$|E

He is {{generally}} quiet, distant, uninterested in people and {{is said to be}} autistic, but has a soft spot for his close friends and the model Shizuka Todou, for whom he has harbored feelings for since childhood. His character is a bit complex, and his feelings for Tsukushi are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> nearly <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of flux varying from annoyance to love. Above all, he cares about her deeply.|$|R
25|$|The Sassanids, {{similar to}} the Roman Empire, were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of {{conflict}} with neighboring kingdoms and nomadic hordes. Although the threat of nomadic incursions could never be fully resolved, the Sassanids generally dealt much more successfully with these matters than did the Romans, due to their policy of making coordinated campaigns against threatening nomads.|$|E
25|$|Since April 4, Mount Redoubt has {{remained}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of mild eruption and dome building at its summit. The Alaska Volcano Observatory warns that more a more vigorous eruption may occur at any time, possibly {{due to a}} potential collapse of the new dome. In late May, 2009, activity decreased and the Alaska Volcano Observatory lowered the alert level.|$|E
25|$|However, Yavapai recalcitrants {{remained}} for years, and raids on stage-coaches, isolated farm houses, and periodic raids on villages kept the area <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of tension. Finally, following several murders of Yavapai chiefs allied with America by insurgent Yavapai warriors, hostile warrior tribal leaders mobilized the entire Yavapai warrior band into a massive {{assault on the}} primary American settlement of Wickenburg and massacred or drove out much of the American populace.|$|E
50|$|In Colonial times, {{and even}} in the first 150 years of the United States, much like Virginia as a whole, South Hampton Roads was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of change in terms of local government, largely due to growth, as {{counties}} were divided and towns were formed as the population grew. Some towns grew to become cities. Under the state constitutional changes in 1871, extant and future cities in Virginia became independent cities of the counties they had formerly been located within.|$|R

50|$|After 1947, a {{significant}} infrastructure undertaking was {{the construction of}} the country's rail network as Albania was considered as the only state in Europe not to have standard rail service. By 1987, 677 km of railway were constructed in total linking the main urban and industrial centers {{for the first time since}} the end of World War II. Train transport was the main public transportation method until 1990. After the collapse of Communism, the network fell into disregard, operating with second-hand carriages <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> precarious <b>state.</b>|$|R
25|$|DeLoach {{was born}} in San Diego, California to Jesse Howell DeLoach and Berta Peña, a woman from Texas of Hispanic-American descent. DeLoach's father was a Chief Yeoman when he met Ms Peña, who at that time (early 1950s) worked {{building}} F-102 fighters at the Convair plant in San Diego. DeLoach's father received a commission in 1960 through the Limited Duty Officer program and as a result, the family was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of relocation, with DeLoach attending schools in various states.|$|E
25|$|During Father Le Loutre's War, the {{soldiers}} guarding Halifax were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of alert. The Mi'kmaq and Acadians raided the capital region (Halifax and Dartmouth) 12 times. The worst of these raids was the Dartmouth Massacre (1751). Four of these raids were against Halifax. The first raid was in July 1750: {{in the woods}} on peninsular Halifax, the Mi'kmaq scalped Cornwallis' gardener, his son, and four others. They buried the son, left the gardener's body exposed, and carried off the other four bodies.|$|E
25|$|When {{the trial}} ended, Sebold disappeared. He entered a {{government}} {{witness protection program}} and moved to California under another assumed identity. He had countless jobs, even {{trying to be a}} chicken farmer, but could never hold down a job and was constantly plagued by bad health. Additionally, letters from his family back in Germany explained that the Nazis still wanted to exact their revenge, leaving him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of fear. Sebold was diagnosed with manic depression and committed to Napa State Hospital in 1965. Five years later he suffered a heart attack and died.|$|E

50|$|Control {{over the}} Free <b>State</b> was <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of flux. Following the {{departure}} of D'Annunzio's troops in December 1920, the Italian National Council of Fiume re-assumed control and appointed a provisional government. A pact with the local Italian commander handed control to the military on 18 January 1921, but this lasted just three days before a nationalist rebellion. They appointed an extraordinary government, which fell two days later. <b>In</b> June 1921 <b>an</b> Italian Royal Commissioner was appointed, whose control lasted two weeks.|$|R

The fertile {{volcanic}} soils support extensive agriculture, with vineyards and orchards spread across the lower slopes of the mountain and the broad Plain of Catania to the south. Due to its history of recent activity and nearby population, Mount Etna has been designated a Decade Volcano by the United Nations. In June 2013, it was added to the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.|$|R
25|$|In reality, {{he started}} a Mexican revolution; however, his fight for profits, control, and {{progress}} kept his people <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of uncertainty. Díaz managed to dissolve all local authorities and all aspects of federalism that once existed. Not long after he became president, the governors of all federal states in Mexico answered directly to him. Those who held high positions of power, such {{as members of the}} legislature, were almost entirely his closest and most loyal friends. In his quest for even more political control, Díaz suppressed the media and controlled the court system.|$|E
25|$|The {{accession}} of Antoninus Pius saw {{the arrival}} of an emperor who took a cautious approach {{to the defense of}} the provinces. The large amount of milestones dated to his reign demonstrates that he was particularly concerned with ensuring that the roads were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of repair. Stamped tiles show that the amphitheater at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, which had been built during the earliest years of the colonia, was repaired under his rule. In addition, given the exposed position of the larger of the Roman fortifications at Porolissum (near Moigrad, Romania), the camp was reconstructed using stone, and given sturdier walls for defensive purposes.|$|E
25|$|At {{times we}} were forty prisoners {{in a cell}} built to {{accommodate}} two people. There were two benches, each capable of seating three persons, and the floor to sleep on. For our private needs, {{there were only three}} chamberpots. They had to be emptied into an old rusty cauldron which also served for washing our clothes. We were forbidden to have food brought to us from outside, and were given disgusting soup cooked with soda ash which kept us <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of dysentery. We were all in a deplorable state. The air was unbreathable and the babies choked many nights for lack of oxygen...|$|E
50|$|The Dragon {{played an}} {{influential}} and beneficial role in Chinese culture. An amalgam of several creatures, including monitor lizards, pythons and the Chinese alligator, the polymorphic dragon was a water spirit, responsible {{for bringing the}} rains and thus ensuring the survival of crops. The dragon was the symbolic guardian to the gods, and {{was the source of}} true wisdom.

50|$|Because Arcanum {{was made}} with a modest sized team (later {{increased}} to 14 people), Anderson took {{on a number of}} different responsibilities. These included art, movies, design, dialogue, scripting, music and sound effects. Added to this came also business-related tasks where he wrote business plans, managed budgeting, wrote proposals, pitched games to publishers, co-negotiated contracts and created and maintained schedules. The decision to keep the team small was a decision that would cost the team many nights and weekends, remembers Boyarsky. He recalls that the company was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> near <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of ‘crunch mode’ (working beyond the normal 40-hour work week), and the staff always felt under pressure.|$|R

Each administration faced substantial institutional crises. In 1973, Ernesto Lopez, former Academic Dean and Acting President of Mt. Angel College, became Colegio's first President. Lopez retained this position for only one year. After the departure of Lopez, the position of administrative head was altered into a co-directorship. Sonny Montes was named Director of Administration. Jose Romero was named Director of Academics. The split into two co-directors was made {{in an attempt to}} relieve the overwhelming duties that Lopez had faced.|$|E
25|$|Under Muawiyah's {{governance}} the Syrian army {{became a}} major military force. He picked out the best leaders from various tribes whereas elsewhere in the state the military units were still based along tribal lines. He personally saw to the comfort and the equipment of the troops, increased their pay and paid them {{on a regular basis}} when they were on duty. He kept the troops in training by an annual expedition against the Byzantines and therefore kept the Byzantines <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of unease and therefore kept his northern border safe. He encouraged innovations in military technology. Muawiyah's armies used “Minjenique” machines to propel large stones onto enemy ramparts. He modernized the army, introducing specialized units for desert combat and snowy terrains. New forts were also built.|$|E
25|$|Through most {{of human}} history {{societies}} {{have been based on}} personal relations: individuals in groups know each other and exchange favors. Today in most lower-income societies hierarchies of groups distribute wealth based on personal relationships among group leaders, a process often linked with clientelism and corruption. Michael Mousseau argues that in this kind of socio-economy conflict is always present, latent or overt, because individuals depend on their groups for physical and economic security and are thus loyal to their groups rather than their states, and because groups are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of conflict over access to state coffers. Through processes of bounded rationality, people are conditioned towards strong in-group identities and are easily swayed to fear outsiders, psychological predispositions that make possible sectarian violence, genocide, and terrorism.|$|E
40|$|The PF {{environment}} {{is one that}} hosts the processes of ovulation, gamete transportation, fertilization, and early embryonic development. The cellular and acellular constituents of this dynamic fluid are <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> interactive <b>state,</b> being influenced by the physiologic events of the menstrual cycle and pelvic disease processes; these constituents probably influence disease manifestation and reproduction. The importance of understanding this zone of early reproductive life has been now recognized. We hope that future investigations will define the exact role(s) of known components and some yet-to-be defined substances of PF in disease processes that affect reproductive function. With better understanding of normal and abnormal events in this pelvic microenvironment, we can develop rationales for novel treatment modalities...|$|R
40|$|The {{occupation}} of Beringia {{remains one of}} the most complex problems in human paleoecology. This is because of the wide array of variables that are likely to have affected the timing and character of settlement in the now partially submerged land that lies between the Lena and Mackenzie Rivers. At a minimum, these variables include changing sea levels and coastlines, advancing and retreating glaciers, changing fauna and flora (including trees), and evolving human adaptations to high-latitude environments. Humans occupied Beringia during the interval between the end of the Last Glacial Maximum cold peak (ca. 20, 000 cal BP) and the beginning of the Holocene (11, 600 cal BP), when all of these variables were <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of flux...|$|R
50|$|Mountainous and cold, Dakor is {{the home}} of the hearty Dakorian tribes. These tribes are <b>in</b> <b>an</b> almost <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of war {{with each other and with}} their neighbours. Dakorians are very fraternal and bond {{together}} in closely knit familial tribes. Even within the tribe, conflict and challenge of authority is looked upon highly, and tribes form Di-Gorums to make decisions. Di-Gorums are essentially assemblies of a representative from each household getting together around an Obelisk and shouting at one another. As people agree with each other, they try to push one of their number to the top of the Obelisk while knocking opponents off. The first person to the top of the Obelisk makes the decision for the tribe.|$|R
25|$|Kierkegaardian {{scholars}} have made several interpretations of how Kierkegaard proceeds with parodying Hegel's dialectic. One {{of the more}} popular interpretations argues the aesthetic-ethical-religious stages are the triadic process Kierkegaard was talking about. See section Spheres of existence for more information. Another interpretation argues for the world-individual-will triadic process. The dialectic here is either to assert an individual's own desire to be independent and the desire {{to be part of a}} community. Instead of reconciliation of the world and the individual where problems between the individual and society are neatly resolved in the Hegelian system, Kierkegaard argues that there's a delicate bond holding the interaction between them together, which needs to be constantly reaffirmed. Jean-Paul Sartre takes this latter view and says the individual is <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of reaffirming his or her own identity, else one falls into bad faith.|$|E
25|$|Early Modern English as a {{literary}} medium was unfixed in structure and vocabulary in comparison to Greek and Latin, and was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of flux. When William Shakespeare began writing his plays, the English language was rapidly absorbing words from other languages due to wars, exploration, diplomacy and colonization. By the age of Elizabeth, English had become widely used with the expansion of philosophy, theology and physical sciences, but many writers lacked the vocabulary to express such ideas. To accommodate, writers such as Edmund Spenser, Sir Philip Sidney, Christopher Marlowe and William Shakespeare expressed new ideas and distinctions by inventing, borrowing or adopting a word or a phrase from another language, known as neologizing. Scholars estimate that, between the years 1500 and 1659, nouns, verbs and modifiers of Latin, Greek and modern Romance languages added 30,000 new words to the English language.|$|E
25|$|From 1630 to 1654, the Dutch set up more {{permanently}} in commercial Recife and aristocratic Olinda. With {{the capture of}} Paraiba in 1635, the Dutch controlled {{a long stretch of}} the coast most accessible to Europe (Dutch Brazil), without, however, penetrating the interior. The large Dutch ships were unable to moor in the coastal inlets where lighter Portuguese shipping came and went. Ironically, the result of the Dutch capture of the sugar coast was a higher price of sugar in Amsterdam. During the Nieuw Holland episode, the colonists of the Dutch West India Company in Brazil were <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>constant</b> <b>state</b> of siege, in spite of the presence of the Count John Maurice of Nassau as governor (1637–1644) in Recife. Nassau invited scientific commissions to research the local flora and fauna, resulting in added knowledge of the territory. Moreover, he set up a city project for Recife and Olinda, which was partially accomplished. Remnants survive into the modern era. After several years of open warfare, the Dutch finally withdrew in 1654; the Portuguese paid off a war debt in payments of salt. Few Dutch cultural and ethnic influences remain. but Albert Eckhout's paintings of indigenous and black Brazilians, as well as his still lifes are important works of baroque art.|$|E

This perspective moves control of employment into the negotiating hands of both employers and employees. One of the biggest challenges todays employers face is creating an organization that attracts and keeps talented people (Pink 1997). In greatest demand are qualified workers who will share responsi-bility for achieving the companys goals and objectivesworkers who will work with the enthusiasm and dedication of shareholders in the company enterprise.
