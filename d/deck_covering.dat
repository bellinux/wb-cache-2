500|$|Calliope {{and sister}} ship [...] {{comprised}} the Calypso class of corvettes designed by Nathaniel Barnaby. Part {{of a long}} line of cruiser classes built for protecting trade routes and colonial police work, they were the last two sailing corvettes built for the Royal Navy. Corvettes had been built of iron since the [...] of 1867, but the Calypsos and the preceding [...] were instead built of steel. Corvettes were designed to operate across the vast distances of Britain's maritime empire, and could not rely on dry docks for maintenance. Since iron (and steel) hulls were subject to biofouling, and they could not easily be cleaned, the established practice of copper sheathing was extended to protect them; the metal plating of the hull was timber-cased and coppered below the waterline. The only armour was a 1.5-inch (38-mm) armoured <b>deck</b> <b>covering</b> the machinery spaces, but coal bunkers along the sides gave some protection to the machinery spaces.|$|E
500|$|Ramillies {{was armed}} with four breech-loading 13.5-inch guns on two barbettes with armour ranging from 11 to 17 inches in thickness. Ramillies also carried ten quick-fire (QF) 6-inch guns, four {{of which were}} mounted in casemates on the main deck, plus sixteen QF 6-pounder Hotchkiss guns and twelve QF 3-pounder Hotchkiss guns. She was also {{equipped}} with seven 18-inch torpedo tubes, two of which were submerged. Between 1899 and 1902, the 3-pounder guns {{were removed from the}} upper tops; the above-water torpedo tubes were removed in 1902–05. The remaining 6-inch guns on the upper deck were mounted on 5-inch armoured casemates between 1902 and 1904. All of the armour was supplied by the builders, J. & G. Thompson, of Clydebank. The waterline belt was 252ft long by 8ft 8in deep, and its armour varied in thickness between 14 and 18 inches; [...] the bulkheads were protected by 14 to 16 inches of armour. The middle <b>deck</b> <b>covering</b> the belt was 3 inches thick and the lower deck forward and aft of the belt was 2.5 inches thick, while the upper belt between the middle and main decks was coated in 3 to 4 inches of armour. The casemates for the 6-inch guns were protected by an equal thickness of armour and the conning tower was protected with 14 inch armour on the forward side, and 3 inches of armour on the aft. The ship's armoured deck was 2.5 to 3 inches thick.|$|E
2500|$|Anna Karoline {{is marked}} by various repairs and changes which makes it {{possible}} to study how the vessel has developed. She was originally clinker built and without a <b>deck</b> <b>covering</b> her cargo hold. In 1890 Anna Karoline ran aground at Kirangrunnen and subsequently towed [...] to Trondheim where the outer hull was plained and a smooth carvel skin was added. Thus one can today see [...] that the vessel has both clinker hull and carvel hull. Anna Karoline got new owners in 1903, they installed a 16 hp engine.|$|E

2500|$|Knievel set most jump records {{using the}} XR-750, but since 2008, most jump records {{are held by}} stunt {{performer}} Bubba Blackwell. [...] Currently, the longest jump on the XR-750 by Bubba Blackwell was successfully made in 1999, when he jumped 15 buses at 157 feet. On August 6, 2015 the daredevil stunt performer Doug Danger [...] at the Sturgis Bike Rally at the Buffalo Chip, broke Knievel's record for most cars jumped on a XR-750 with 22 cars. [...] Knievel attempted this feat of 22 cars in Monroe, Washington on September 1, 1972 and cleared 21 cars but landed on the safety <b>deck</b> <b>covering</b> the 22nd car. Bubba Blackwell attempted the same 22-car jump In 2001 with horrible consequences. He flipped end-over-end when he missed the landing, nearly died and {{was in a coma}} for months.

5000|$|Construction of {{the cathedral}} began in 1954 and was {{dedicated}} in 1980. The {{plan to build a}} modern cathedral in Owerri was led by the diocese and its Irish Bishop, Joseph Brendan Whelan. Funds were sourced from church members and from abroad, in particular Rome. An Irish priest, Rev. Christopher King who was also an architect supervised the construction of the structure right before the Civil War. The site chosen for the cathedral was at the outskirts of Owerri near an inter-state road junction that links Owerri to Port Harcourt, Onitsha, and Aba. The commencement of the Nigerian Civil War impeded construction from 1967 to 1970. Before the war, construction had progressed and {{the main part of the}} building with the exception of the roof <b>deck</b> and <b>covering</b> was already finished. [...] During the war, the site {{of the cathedral}} came under fire a few times because the dome was thought to be an observation post.|$|R
6000|$|One {{has some}} {{difficulty}} in giving a reader accurate {{notions of the}} confusion of so awful a scene. The motion of the vessel was arrested suddenly, {{as it might be}} by a wall, and the whole fabric seemed to be shaken to dissolution. The very next roller that came in, which would have undulated in towards the land but for us, meeting with so large a body in its way, piled up and broke upon our <b>decks,</b> <b>covering</b> everything with water. At the same time, the hull lifted, and, aided by wind, sea and current, it set still further on the reef, thumping in a way to break strong iron bolts, like so many sticks of sealing-wax, and cracking the solid live-oak of the floor-timbers as if they were made of willow. The captain stood aghast! For one moment despair was painfully depicted in his countenance; then he recovered his self-possession and seamanship. He gave the order to stand by to carry out to windward the stream-anchor in the launch, and to send a kedge to haul out by, in the jolly-boat. Marble answered with the usual [...] "ay, ay, sir!" [...] but before he sent us into the boats, he ventured to suggest that the ship had bilged already. He had heard timbers crack, about which he thought there could be no mistake. The pumps were sounded, and the ship had seven feet water in her hold. This had made in about ten minutes. Still the captain would not give up. He ordered us to commence throwing the teas overboard, in order to ascertain, if possible, the extent of the injury. A place was broken out {{in the wake of the}} main-hatch, and a passage was opened down into the lower-hold, where we met the water. In the mean time, a South-Sea man we had picked up at Canton, dove down under the lee of the bilge of the ship. He soon came back and reported that a piece of sharp rock had gone quite through the planks. Everything tending to corroborate this, the captain called a council of all hands on the quarter-deck, to consult as to further measures.|$|R

They are intended for berthing vessels having displacement up to 40,000 tons on a jetty by serving as spacers between the jetty and the ship.|$|E
50|$|Air Chief Marshal Portal {{asked about}} {{potential}} bomb damage to Habbakuk III, and Bernal {{suggested that a}} certain amount of <b>deck</b> <b>covering</b> might be ripped off, but could be repaired by some kind of flexible matting. It would be more difficult to deal with bomb holes in the centre portion, though the roof over the aircraft hangars would be made proof against 1,000 kg bombs. Bernal considered that no one could say whether the larger Habbakuk II was a practical proposition until a large-scale model could be completed and tested in Canada in the spring of 1944. He had no doubts about the suitability of pykrete as a material, but said that constructional and navigational difficulties remained to be overcome.|$|E
50|$|Two {{basically}} different superstructures (fiberglass {{top of the}} cabin) {{were available}} on the 35-41 foot Holiday Mansion models.

Another extended the superstructure all the way aft over the engine and allowed for an additional stateroom and head aft of the galley. In this configuration engine access was gained by an engine lid that doubled as a berth support. The superstructure was also pushed out to even with the gunnels. This eliminated the walk around deck, but allowed more room for the aft stateroom and galley.|$|R
50|$|The CAC Wirraway was a {{training}} and general purpose military aircraft. The fuselage comprised a welded framework composed of chrome and steel, which was construction from four separately produced sections bolted together during final assembly. The {{sides of the}} fuselage featured fabric covering supported by aluminium alloy frames, while the underside and <b>decking</b> has metal <b>coverings</b> instead. The single-spar wings, which were built in five individual sections, were composed of spaced ribs and a stressed skin. The control surfaces were metal-framed with fabric covering; the split-flap arrangement of early Wirraways were supplemented on later-built aircraft via the addition of dive brakes. An all-metal stressed skin construction {{was used for the}} tailplane and fin; both side of the tailplane were interchangeable.|$|R
2500|$|It {{was a more}} pleasing-looking {{machine with}} a shorter fuselage, cowled engine, {{simplified}} undercarriage and heavily revised empennage. The fuselage had rounded upper <b>decking</b> and aluminium <b>covering</b> at the front. Blackburn had persisted with the Second Monoplane's Antoinette-style fin and tailplane through subsequent aircraft, but the Type D's tailplane had a much less steeply swept leading edge (though still 60°) than its predecessors and carried a divided elevator. The fin likewise was less swept though still long, and now carried a single rudder rather than the characteristic triangular pair previously used. The undercarriage featured a pair of wheels, compared with four on the Mercury, with two struts per side terminating on skids and joined by the axle and a higher transverse strut. For the first time, Blackburn fitted a rudder bar in preference to his [...] "triple steering column".|$|R

The Scout cruisers were intended to lead and support destroyer flotillas, and their armament was meant to fight destroyers rather than heavier ships. Main gun armament consisted of ten 12-pounder (76 mm) QF guns, arranged three abreast fore-and-aft to give maximum end-on fire for chase engagements and two more guns on each beam. This was supplemented by eight 3-pounder (47 mm) guns. Two 18 inch (450 mm) torpedo tubes were fitted, with a single spare torpedo carried. This armament was considered too light, and an additional two 12-pounder guns were added on the ship's beams soon after commissioning, while the 3-pounder guns were replaced by six 6-pounder (57 mm) guns. She was rearmed again in 1911-12, when the 12-pounder guns were replaced by nine 4 inch guns.|$|E

25|$|It {{was first}} called the New Bandstand, {{and then the}} Central Bandstand, to {{differentiate}} it from other bandstands in Herne Bay, especially the bandstand which stood {{on the roof of}} the King's Hall and has since been demolished. The north or seaward side of the Central Bandstand was built in 1924, with alterations in 1931. The original architect was Herbert Kempton Dyson, M.I.Struct.E (1880–1944), who was a founder member of the Concrete Institute, and specialised in reinforced concrete structures. The 1924 section has two outside seaward-facing balconies with space for deckchairs, including a cantilevered roof for the lower <b>deck</b> and for <b>covering</b> the stage inside. Metal, glazed screens at the east and west sides of the building crossed the promenade, and could be moved to protect the audience from wind, or retracted into the wings to allow promenaders to cross when no band was playing. The seating area was a railed-off section of the promenade, and the seating on the roof above the stage included two copper-covered domes, plus two domes which doubled as refreshment kiosks. The roof is now inaccessible for safety reasons. By the late 1920s the audience area in front of the stage had extended across Tower Gardens to the edge of the footpath and road.|$|R
