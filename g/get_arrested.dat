5|$|Meanwhile, LaBonge finds a {{man named}} Cissy Alvarez whom Maleeni owed money. LaBonge admits that he caused Maleeni's head to fall off, and says that he will give Alvarez the money he is owed if he helps him with his magic. Mulder and Scully learn that Maleeni has an {{identical}} twin brother, Albert. Albert, interestingly enough is even wearing a neckbrace, which he says he got {{in a car accident}} in Mexico. Mulder tells him he thinks he did the magic act, but the man shows that he has no legs, which he also lost in Mexico in the car accident. Back at work, Alvarez threatens Pinchbeck that he will kill him if he does not get his money. LaBonge then frames Alvarez for a robbery by attacking a security truck disguised as Alvarez. Mulder soon finds out that Pinchbeck is the real Maleeni and that he faked having no legs. After confronting Pinchbeck, he admits that he faked his own death in order to get out of Alvarez's debt. Pinchbeck admits that he found his brother dead of a heart attack at home and used his body as a double. Pinchbeck is promptly arrested, as is LaBonge, who brings a gun to a bar, in an attempt to purposely <b>get</b> <b>arrested.</b> In addition, Alvarez is arrested because of the attempted robbery LaBonge did earlier.|$|E

25|$|Dr. King {{decided to}} make a {{conscious}} effort to <b>get</b> <b>arrested,</b> for the benefit of publicity. On February 1, King and Ralph Abernathy refused to cooperate with Chief Baker's traffic directions {{on the way to the}} courthouse, calculating that Baker would arrest them, putting them in the Selma city jail run by Baker's police, rather than the county jail run by Clark's deputies. Once processed, King and Abernathy refused to post bond. On the same day, SCLC and SNCC organizers took the campaign outside of Dallas County for the first time; in nearby Perry County 700 students and adults, including James Orange, were arrested.|$|E
25|$|The {{capture of}} Jorge Eduardo Costilla Sánchez and Mario Cárdenas Guillén leaves the Gulf Cartel without a {{definite}} successor. Both arrests in effect {{wipe out the}} traditional old-time bosses of the cartel, {{putting an end to}} a generation of drug traffickers. When Cárdenas Guillén was arrested on 4 September 2012, it looked as if Costilla Sánchez had finally won the leadership of the Gulf Cartel. Throughout the end of 2011 and until the time of his arrest in 2012, Costilla Sánchez had carried out a campaign to put down Cárdenas Guillén and his faction – the Rojos – by reportedly setting up its members to <b>get</b> <b>arrested</b> or killed. His attempts to successfully put down his rivals allegedly gave him the protection of some high-ranking officials in the Mexican Armed Forces.|$|E

The police issued orders to all the leaders who attended this Bombay session. Kamaraj {{did not want to}} <b>get</b> <b>arrested</b> before he took the message to all district and local leaders. He decided not to go to Madras and decided to cut short his trip; he saw a large number of policemen waiting for the arrest of Congress leaders in Arakonam but managed to escape from the police and went to Ranipet, Tanjore, Trichy and Madurai to inform local leaders about the programme. He reached Virdhunagar after finishing his work and sent a message to the local police that he was ready to be arrested. He was arrested in August 1942. He was under detention for three years and was released in June 1945. This was his last prison term. Kamaraj was imprisoned six times by the British for his pro-Independence activities, accumulating more than 3,000 days in jail.|$|E

500|$|The raid {{did not go}} as planned. Standard {{procedure}} was to line up the patrons, check their identification, and have female police officers take customers dressed as women {{to the bathroom to}} verify their sex, upon which any men dressed as women would be arrested. Those dressed as women that night refused to go with the officers. Men in line began to refuse to produce their identification. The police decided to take everyone present to the police station, after separating those cross-dressing in a room {{in the back of the}} bar. Maria Ritter, then known as Steve to her family, recalled, [...] "My biggest fear was that I would <b>get</b> <b>arrested.</b> My second biggest fear was that my picture would be in a newspaper or on a television report in my mother's dress!" [...] Both patrons and police recalled that a sense of discomfort spread very quickly, spurred by police who began to assault some of the lesbians by [...] "feeling some of them up inappropriately" [...] while frisking them.|$|E

500|$|The Hardy Boys {{began to}} be {{published}} in paperback in 1979. The Hardys were also featured in two new series, the Hardy Boys Casefiles and the Clues Brothers. The latter series, modeled on the Nancy Drew Notebooks, was aimed at a younger audience, and ran from 1997 to 2000. In contrast, the Casefiles, begun a decade earlier in 1987, was aimed at an older audience than the Hardy Boys Mystery Stories. In the new series, the Hardys' work with a secret government organization simply called the [...] "Network", with which they collaborate to [...] "infiltrate organized crime, battle terrorists and track down assassins around the world." [...] The Hardys' personalities are portrayed as more separate and distinct, and they sometimes fight; in the first of the series, Dead on Target, for example, the brothers brawl after Frank tries to restrain Joe after Joe's girlfriend, Iola Morton, is killed by a car bomb. In general, the series is more violent, and the Hardy Boys carry various guns; Lines like [...] "Joe! Hand me the Uzi!" [...] are not out of character. Barbara Steiner, a Casefiles ghostwriter, describes a sample plot outline: [...] "I was told that Joe Hardy would get involved with a waitress, a black widow kind of character, and that Joe would <b>get</b> <b>arrested</b> for murder. I was told the emphasis was on high action and suspense and {{there had to be a}} cliff-hanger ending to every chapter." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prosecution of DCs for {{unlicensed}} practice {{after the}} conviction of D.D. Palmer and a previous charge against B.J. Palmer resulted in B.J. and several Palmer graduates creating the Universal Chiropractic Association (UCA). Its initial purpose was to protect its members by covering their legal expenses should they <b>get</b> <b>arrested.</b> Its first case came in 1907, when Shegataro Morikubo DC of Wisconsin was charged with unlicensed practice of osteopathy. It was {{a test of the}} new osteopathic law. In an ironic twist, using mixer Langworthy's book Modernized Chiropractic, attorney Tom Morris legally differentiated chiropractic from osteopathy by the differences in the philosophy of chiropractic's [...] "supremacy of the nerve" [...] and osteopathy's [...] "supremacy of the artery". Morikubo was freed, and the victory reshaped the development of the chiropractic profession, which then marketed itself as a science, an art and a philosophy, and B.J. Palmer became the [...] "Philosopher of Chiropractic".|$|E

2500|$|The US {{ambassador}} to Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, stated that Siddiqui {{had not been}} in US custody [...] "at any time" [...] prior to July 2008. The US Justice Department and the CIA denied the allegations, and Gregory Sullivan, a State Department spokesman, said: [...] "For several years, we have had no information regarding her whereabouts whatsoever. It is our belief that she ... has all this time been concealed from the public view by her own choosing." [...] Assistant US Attorney David Raskin said in 2008 that US agencies found [...] "zero evidence" [...] that she was abducted, kidnapped or tortured in 2003. He added: [...] "A more plausible inference is that she went into hiding because people around her started to <b>get</b> <b>arrested,</b> and at least two of those people ended up at Guantanamo Bay." [...] According to some U.S. officials, she went underground after the FBI alert for her was issued, and was at large working on behalf of al-Qaeda. The Guardian cited an anonymous senior Pakistani official suggesting Siddiqui may have abandoned the militant cause.|$|E
