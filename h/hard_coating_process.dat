40|$|TiC-VC {{multilayered}} {{hard coating}} were obtained using an original two step <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> <b>process.</b> Xray analysis, micro-hardness measurements and GDMS’s chemical profiles {{have been conducted}} to characterise, respectively, crystallography, hardness and multilayer structure {{as a function of}} the sub-layer thickness. It shows that although well TiC and VC carbide textures are maintained, a decrease of the sublayer thickness promotes inter-diffusion phenomena which progressively erase the alternated structure. The micro-hardness variation as a function of sublayer thickness displays a parabolic evolution with maximum hardness for a critical thickness around 50 nm. Consistent with the dislocation moving force theories, these results confirm that the micro-hardness evolution is function of the carbide grain size. Wear and friction properties have been studied under gross slip fretting conditions. A “composite” wear model, which considers the diffusion inter-layer, has been developed. Unlike classical rules of mixtures, the modulation dependence of wear and friction is here considered. Reliable wear rates as a function the modulation thickness can be predicted. The friction evolution is less easily predicted due to the smoothing effect of third body. Finally, the opposite evolution between wear resistance and micro-hardness is discussed, outlining the necessity of avoiding any direct prediction of a given tribological response from a plain micro-hardness measurement...|$|E
40|$|The Physical Vapour Deposition (PVD) {{magnetron}} sputtering process {{is one of}} the widely used techniques for depositing thin film coatings on substrates for various applications such as integrated circuit fabrication, decorative coatings, and hard coatings for tooling. In the area of coatings on cutting tools, tool life can be improved drastically with the application of hard coatings. Application of coatings on cutting tools for various machining techniques, such as continuous and interrupted cutting, requires different coating characteristics, these being highly dependent on the process parameters under which they were formed. To efficiently optimise and customise the deposited coating characteristics, PVD process modelling using RSM methodology was proposed. The aim of this research is to develop a PVD {{magnetron sputtering}} process model which can predict the relationship between the process input parameters and resultant coating characteristics and performance. Response Surface Methodology (RSM) was used, this being one of the most practical and cost effective techniques to develop a process model. Even though RSM has been used for the optimisation of the sputtering process, published RSM modelling work on the application of <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> <b>process</b> on cutting tool is lacking. This research investigated the deposition of TiAlN coatings onto tungsten carbide cutting tool inserts using PVD magnetron sputtering process. The input parameters evaluated were substrate temperature, substrate bias voltage, and sputtering power; the out put responses being coating hardness, coating roughness, and flank wear (coating performance). In addition to that, coating microstructures were investigated to explain the behaviour of the developed model. Coating microstructural phenomena assessed were; crystallite grain size, XRD peak intensity ratio I 111 /I 200 and atomic number percentage ratio of Al/Ti. Design Expert 7. 0. 3 software was used for the RSM analysis. Three process models (hardness, roughness, performance) were successfully developed and validated. The modelling validation runs were within the 90 % prediction interval of the developed models and their residual errors compared to the predicted values were less than 10 %. The models were also qualitatively validated by justifying the behaviour of the output responses (hardness, roughness, and flank wear) and microstructures (Al/Ti ratio, crystallographic peak ratio I 111 / 1200, and grain size) with respect to the variation of the input variables based on the published work by researchers and practitioners in this field. The significant parameters that influenced the coating hardness, roughness, and performance (flank wear) were also identified. Coating hardness was influenced by the substrate bias voltage, sputtering power, and substrate temperature; coating roughness was influenced by sputtering power and substrate bias; and coating performance was influenced by substrate bias. The analysis also discovered that there was a significant interaction between the substrate temperature and the sputtering power which significantly influenced coating hardness, roughness, and performance; this interaction phenomenon has not been reported in previously published literature. The correlation study between coating characteristics, microstructures and the coating performance (flank wear) suggested that the coating performance correlated most significantly to the coating hardness with Pearson coefficient of determination value (R 2) of 0. 7311. The study also suggested some correlation between coating performance with atomic percentage ratio of Al/Ti and grain size with R 2 value of 0. 4762 and 0. 4109 respectively...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> is a {{well-known}} surface treatment technology for steels to improve wear resistance and, to some extent, corrosion resistance. In principle, <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> {{can be carried out}} for Al alloys, but due to the natural oxide layer and the insufficient load-bearing capacity of the soft base material, the application of this technology for wear protection of components is not regarded as being particularly promising. The research activities described in this paper focused on electron beam (EB) surface alloying with a Co-based additive, and the influence of two different hardness levels (270 HV 0. 1 and 390 HV 0. 1) on the improvement of the local load-bearing capacity of Al alloys with thin PVD hard coatings. A further focus of this research was on the material-specific aspects of the coating deposition. Compared to steels, the <b>hard</b> <b>coated</b> surface of Al alloys is rougher and the measured adhesion of the coating is significantly lower. For this purpose, different technological PVD parameters (e. g. Ti interlayer, deposition temperature, and time) were adapted to optimize the coating properties – especially adhesion. The paper deals with comparative studies of single (PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating</b> of Al base material) and duplex treatment (EB alloying of Al base material and subsequent PVD <b>hard</b> <b>coating)</b> by means of improvement of the coating and com-pound hardness, friction and wear behavior (pin-on-disc test), as well as the corrosion resistance (potentiodynamic measurements in 0. 05 M H 2 SO 4).

Electron spin resonance (ESR) was used to assay hydroxyl radical (HO·) spin-trap adducts. Post-detonation coating materials indicate that some particles contain substantial Cr and lesser amounts of other metals not present in the pre-coating materials. Post-detonation coating samples often had apparent surface Co and sometimes Cr on the tungsten carbide (WC) particles, as shown by elemental mapping of individual particles. This surface Co and Cr was not evident in pre-detonation samples or unsintered materials.

The overspray materials from the detonation-coating process produced 9 -fold more HO · than pre-detonation samples, on a mass basis.
