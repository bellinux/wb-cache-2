5000|$|... 19 {{years after}} the incident, a woman member made a confession. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Japanese Empire was that of kami. In spite of <b>the</b> fact <b>that</b> we {{endeavored}} to win with all our strength, we were defeated. All of my convictions crumbled and I was unable to bear <b>the</b> strain. <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strength of a nation lies on its forces and soldiers and joined the Empire Volunteer. If it will win, all of our members are prepared to die. My convictions are the same even now and I have no regrets.|$|R
25|$|To put {{artifacts}} {{in their proper}} context I consider it most important {{to pay attention to}} the chronological sequence, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> old idea of first stone, then copper, and finally iron, appears to be ever more firmly established as far as Scandinavia is concerned.|$|E
25|$|I don't. I {{support the}} Hyde Amendment. I hate abortion. I wish people didn't have abortions. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Hyde Amendment should remain the law.

I supported it in New York, but I think, in other places, people can come to a different decision.|$|E
25|$|The special {{delegate}} for the safeguarding of art {{and cultural}} properties {{has just returned from}} Holland. He notified me today that there exists at the moment a particularly favorable opportunity to purchase valuable works of art from Dutch dealers and private owners in German currency. Even though a large number of important works have doubtless been removed recently from Holland, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> trade still contains many objects which are desirable for the Führer's collection, and which may be acquired without foreign exchange.|$|E

25|$|I yield {{neither to}} Senator Borah nor {{to any other}} man in admiration of the Farewell Address and of the great Fathers of the Republic; but I would not use them as a cover for party politics. Never did I sneer at the Farewell Address; but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> greatness of Washington was due to his looking the facts of his day in the face, and {{determining}} his conduct thereby, instead of by utterances, however wise of {{a hundred and fifty}} years before. I will trust the American people not to mistake short-sightedness for patriotism or narrow-mindedness for love of country.|$|E
25|$|Since {{my life as}} a {{prisoner}} has begun, I have heard the teachings of the white man's religion, and in many respects believe it to be better than the religion of my fathers... Believing that in a wise way it is good to go to church, and that associating with Christians would improve my character, I have adopted the Christian religion. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> church has helped me much during the short time I have been a member. I am not ashamed to be a Christian, and I am glad to know that the President of the United States is a Christian, for without the help of the Almighty I do not think he could rightly judge in ruling so many people. I have advised all of my people who are not Christians, to study that religion, because {{it seems to me the}} best religion in enabling one to live right.|$|E
500|$|In {{a speech}} given when she {{unveiled}} the design in January 1948, Ross indicated {{that she had}} been urged to put Franklin on the cent because of his association with the adage [...] "a penny saved is a penny earned" [...] (in Franklin's original, [...] "A penny saved is twopence dear".) [...] Ross stated, [...] "You will agree, <b>I</b> <b>believe,</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> fifty-cent piece, being larger and of silver, lends itself much better to the production of an impressive effect." [...] On April 29, 1948, the day before the coin's public release, Ross held a dinner party for 200 at the Franklin Institute in Philadelphia; each guest received a Franklin half dollar in a card signed by Ross.|$|E

500|$|In a {{dramatic}} debate with Frederick Douglass at the AERA convention in 1869, Stone argued that suffrage for women {{was more important}} than suffrage for African Americans. She nevertheless supported the amendment, saying, [...] "But I thank God for that XV. Amendment, and hope that it will be adopted in every State. I will be thankful in my soul if any body can get out of the terrible pit. [...] But <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> safety of the government would be more promoted by the admission of woman as an element of restoration and harmony than the negro." [...] Stone and her allies expected that their active support for the amendment to enfranchise black men would lead their abolitionist friends in Congress to push for an amendment to enfranchise women as the next step, but that did not happen.|$|E
500|$|Although {{federal judges}} are {{prohibited}} from commenting publicly [...] "on the merits of a matter pending or impending in any court", Judge Alfred T. Goodwin has stated that circuit court judges will occasionally create circuit splits to [...] "hold the Supreme Court's toes to the fire" [...] and force the Supreme Court to overrule precedent in other circuits. Goodwin also wrote that [...] "some of our number actually found it intellectually stimulating to challenge the Supreme Court from time to time" [...] but that those judges were [...] "usually were rewarded by a Nine Zip reversal". Likewise, Judge Charles R. Wilson noted that when he drafted dissenting opinions, he would consider whether the parties planned to appeal {{the case to the}} Supreme Court of the United States, and [...] "f <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parties will , I write the dissent with the Supreme Court in mind". C. Steven Bradford has also argued that circuit courts will [...] "disregard a Supreme Court precedent if convinced that the Supreme Court would not follow it".|$|E
500|$|Focusing on {{the quality}} of the poem, Stuart Sperry, argued in 1973, [...] "'Ode to a Nightingale' is the supreme {{expression}} in all Keats's poetry of the impulse to imaginative escape that flies in the face of the knowledge of human limitation, the impulse fully expressed in 'Away! away! for I will fly to thee.'" [...] Wolf Hirst, in 1981, described the poem as [...] "justly celebrated" [...] and claimed that [...] "Since this movement into an eternal realm of song is one of the most magnificent in literature, the poet's return to actuality is all the more shattering." [...] Helen Vendler continued the earlier view that the poem was artificial but added that the poem was an attempt to be aesthetic and spontaneous that was later dropped. In 1983, she argued, [...] "In its absence of conclusiveness and its abandonment to reverie, the poem appeals to readers who prize it as the most personal, the most apparently spontaneous, the most immediately beautiful, and the most confessional of Keats's odes. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 'events' of the ode, as it unfolds in time, have more logic, however, than is usually granted them, and that they are best seen in relation to Keats's pursuit of the idea of music as a nonrepresentational art." ...|$|E

50|$|According {{to modern}} historiography, Bolesław began {{to pay tribute}} to Emperor Henry V, at least from 1135. <b>Is</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> amount was 500 marks of fine silver annually.

500|$|Hill set a {{provisional}} pole position time of 1:20.081 {{during the first}} qualifying session, ahead of Berger, Coulthard, Alesi, Häkkinen and Schumacher. The session was disrupted after Schumacher crashed heavily into the tyre barrier at turneight, a corner normally taken at a speed of [...] As a precaution, Benetton opted to keep Schumacher's teammate, Johnny Herbert, in the garage while the team found out {{what was wrong with}} the car. This meant that Herbert did not set a time in the session, while Schumacher completed only two of his twelve allotted laps. Speaking of the incident, Schumacher said that [...] "there was a little movement in the steering wheel at the previous corner and at the next it went completely. I spun the car backwards into the tyre barrier and the safety structure behind my head {{did a good job of}} protecting me. For sure I am not very happy about this, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> team will spend a lot of time investigating the situation for tomorrow and they will find the problem." [...] The problem was determined to be a steering failure, specifically a joint in the car's steering column. Replacement steering components were sourced from São Paulo by Benetton engineer Tim Wright, and the team did not encounter any problems over the remainder of the weekend.|$|E
