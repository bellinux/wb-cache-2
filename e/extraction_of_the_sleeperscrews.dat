This method is also applicable to fiber gratings which are either physically multilayer or mathematically divided into layers along the radial coordinate. Although the well-known coupled mode theory (CMT) is accounted {{a method for}} <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coefficients <b>of</b> reflection and transmission of finite-length FBGs, its inadequacy for <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Bloch eigenmodes <b>of</b> FBGs is illustrated, even if <b>the</b> modulation depth <b>of</b> refractive index is small and the Bragg condition is satisfied. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Source {{extraction}} was traditionally done by sensor arrays. Recently, sensor {{networks have}} been considered as promising candidates for <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> multiple sources. In a sensor network, each sensor observes an instantaneous linear mixture <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources and their observations are corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise. Two sensor network models are adopted. The first one is cluster based, in which a sensor acts as cluster head and performs local <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources based on its own observation and the received quantized data from the cluster members. Then, the extracted signal is quantized and the quantized data are sent to the sink while the sink performs global <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources. The other one is cluster free, in which data collected by the sensors are quantized {{and sent to the}} sink directly. Then, the sink performs global <b>extraction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sources. The proposed schemes are evaluated against the benchmarking case where the sensor observations are undistorted. Index Terms—Blind source extraction, distributed estimation, wireless sensor network.
