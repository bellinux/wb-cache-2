5|$|In July 2010, Kyrgyzstan saw an {{outbreak}} of <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> in which as many as 2,000 people, primarily Uzbeks, were killed, {{and hundreds of thousands}} displaced. Following the violence, dozens of Uzbek community and religious leaders were arrested by the Kyrgyzstani government and accused of inciting <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence,</b> among them Azimzhan Askarov, who had been filming killings and arson attacks during the riots. Askarov then distributed the video to international media and accused the Kyrgyz military of complicity in the killings.|$|E
5|$|<b>Ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> {{for control}} over the oil-producing Niger Delta region and {{inadequate}} infrastructures {{are some of the}} issues in the country.

5|$|Despite the {{occupation}} of South Kasai, the South Kasaian state was not dismantled and co-existed {{with the rest of}} the Congo. Congolese delegates, as well as ANC and UN troops were generally able to move around the territory without conflict with the South Kasaian authorities while their sporadic campaign against Katangese forces continued. Nevertheless, throughout much of the period, the South Kasaian gendarmerie fought with Kanyok and Lulua militias across the region while local <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> persisted.|$|E
40|$|Since the 1980 s, ethnic civil conflicts, and {{especially}} self-determination move-ments, {{have dominated the}} type of armed conflicts present in the international system. While studies on <b>ethnic</b> civil <b>violence</b> have increased {{over the past several}} decades, there remains much debate regarding the conditions associated with the incidence of <b>ethnic</b> civil <b>violence.</b> The question remains: why do some ethnic groups choose to engage in certain types of civil violence while others do not? This dissertation contributes to the study of <b>ethnic</b> civil <b>violence</b> by analyzing the onset of such violence and offering a new theoretical approach to account for it. Drawing from theories of ethnic group dynamics, rational choice, and collec-tive action, I argue that ethnic group size is an important determinant of ethnic group decisions to initiate <b>ethnic</b> civil <b>violence.</b> Utilizing quantitative analyses of global conflict data from 1946 to 2009, survey analyses of Afrobarometer data from 2005 to 2009, and comparative historical case studies drawn from Africa and Western Asia, I demonstrate that the likelihood of <b>ethnic</b> civil <b>violence,</b> as well a...|$|R

5|$|Psychiatrist Viktor Frankl drew on his {{imprisonment}} at Auschwitz in composing Man's Search for Meaning (1946), one of {{the most}} widely read works about the camp. An existentialist work, the book argues that individuals can find purpose even among great suffering, and that this sense of purpose sustains them. Wiesel wrote about his own imprisonment at Auschwitz in Night (1960) and other works, and became a prominent spokesman against <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence.</b> In 1986, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.|$|E

5|$|Since {{the end of}} {{the civil}} war in 1970, some <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> has persisted.

The 2002 Miss World pageant was moved from Abuja to London in the wake of violent protests in the Northern part of the country that left more than 100people dead and over 500 injured. The rioting erupted after Muslims in the country reacted in anger to comments made by a newspaper reporter. Rioters in Kaduna killed an estimated 105 men, women, and children with a further 521 injured taken to hospital.|$|E
5|$|The airport area to {{the east}} of Honiara was the site of a battle between the United States and the Japanese during the Guadalcanal Campaign in World War II, the Battle of Henderson Field of 1942, from which America emerged victorious. After Honiara became the new {{administrative}} centre of the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1952 with the addition of many administrative buildings, the town began to develop and grow in population. Since the late 1990s, Honiara has suffered a turbulent history of <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> and political unrest and is scarred by rioting. A coup attempt in June 2000 resulted in violent rebellions and fighting between the ethnic Malaitans of the Malaita Eagle Force (MEF) and the Guadalcanal natives of the Isatabu Freedom Movement (IFM).|$|E

The following month ANC soldiers raided Tshombe's residence on accusations that he was maintaining a private militia. Later, the central government seized documents revealing his continued contact with foreign mercenaries. Fearing arrest and claiming political persecution, Tshombe fled to Paris, France, in June, eventually settling in Madrid, Spain. From there he developed plans with his gendarmerie commanders {{for a return to}} power, further complicating the central government's efforts to absorb the force.|$|E
5|$|Beginning with late 1987 the Caucasus {{region was}} {{experiencing}} {{a surge in}} political turmoil with large and near constant demonstrations being held {{in the capital of}} Yerevan beginning in February 1988. For the fifteen months prior to the earthquake and at times up to hundreds of thousands of protesters, represented by the Karabakh Committee, were demanding both democracy and the unification of Nagorno-Karabakh (administered by Soviet Azerbaijan but disputed autonomous territory with an 80% Armenian majority and the Azerbaijani minority) in the mountains of the Karabakh region. The unrest and the opposition movement began in September 1988 with negotiations between the Karabakh Committee and Gorbachev taking place throughout most of 1989. The relationship between the Soviet authorities and the Armenian society took {{a turn for the worse}} in March and the developments climaxed in November when a state of emergency was declared, along with a nighttime curfew, and a mass movement of up to 50,000 Armenians fleeing <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> arrived from Azerbaijan.|$|E
5|$|Ethnic {{cleansing}} in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{happened on}} a larger scale than in the RSK, and all the major ethnic groups became victims of ethnically motivated violence. The conflict produced a vast number of displaced persons. It is estimated that there were over a million refugees in areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina outside VRS control at the end of 1994, while the area's total population was about 2.2 million. About 720,000 Bosniaks, 460,000 Serbs and 150,000 Croats fled the country. Croatia hosted {{a large proportion of the}} Bosniak and Croat refugees; by November 1992 there were around 333,000 registered, and an estimated 100,000 unregistered, refugees from Bosnia and Herzegovina in Croatia. The refugees left their homes under varied circumstances. The <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> committed by Bosnian Serbs against civilians resulted in the greatest number of civilian victims in the Bosnian war, culminating in the 1995 Srebrenica massacre.|$|E

5|$|Sri Lanka {{became an}} {{independent}} nation in 1948. Since independence, the political relationship between Sinhalese and Sri Lankan Tamil {{community has been}} strained. Sri Lanka {{has been unable to}} contain its <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence</b> as it escalated from sporadic terrorism to mob violence, and finally to civil war. The Sri Lankan Civil War has several underlying causes: the ways in which modern ethnic identities have been made and remade since the colonial period, rhetorical wars over archaeological sites and place name etymologies, and the political use of the national past. The civil war resulted in the death of at least 100,000 people and, according to human rights groups such as Human Rights Watch, the forced disappearance of thousands of others (see White van abductions in Sri Lanka). Since 1983, Sri Lanka has also witnessed massive civilian displacements of more than a million people, with eighty percent of them being Sri Lankan Tamils.|$|E
5|$|The {{continuing}} {{military confrontation}} {{in the region}} was accompanied by an escalation of <b>ethnic</b> <b>violence,</b> culminating in war crimes against civilians committed by military authorities in Gospić and the SAO Krajina military {{in the area around}} Lički Osik in October 1991. In Gospić, approximately 100 Serb civilians were taken from the town and killed in the surrounding fields. Some of the responsibles for the event, later known as the Gospić massacre, were prosecuted by the Croatian judiciary. This resulted in the conviction, in 2003, of Norac and two other defendants to 12 years in prison. The killings in the Lički Osik area, known as the Široka Kula massacre, resulted in the deaths of 40 civilians, mostly Croats but also some Serbs suspected of supporting Croatia. In 2011, a court in Belgrade, Serbia, convicted four former SAO Krajina militiamen of killing four Serbs and a Croat in Široka Kula.|$|E

As India neared independence from the British Empire, the political situation had changed significantly; by October 1947 {{he was one of the}} last British individuals in a high-up position within the country's governing establishment, and recognised that many Indian nationalists wanted him to also leave.|$|E
5|$|The {{conflict}} between Serbs and Croats spread to eastern Slavonia in early 1991. On 1 April, Serb villagers around Vukovar and other towns in eastern Slavonia began to erect barricades across main roads. The White Eagles, a Serbian paramilitary {{group led by}} Vojislav Šešelj, moved into the Serb-populated village of Borovo Selo just north of Vukovar. In mid-April 1991, Armbrust shoulder-launched anti-tank missiles were fired at Borovo Selo. According to one version of the event, missiles were fired at agricultural machinery that served as barricades. According to a second version, three missiles were fired at houses inhabited by Serbs. There were no casualties, but the attack aggravated and deepened ethnic tensions. On 2 May, Serb paramilitaries ambushed two Croatian police buses in the centre of Borovo Selo, killing 12 policemen and injuring 22 more. Three Serbs were also killed. The Battle of Borovo Selo represented the worst act of violence between the country's Serbs and Croats since the Second World War.
