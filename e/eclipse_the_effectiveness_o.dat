For this we present AnaCon, a proof-of-concept system where normative texts written in CNL are automatically translated into the formal language CL using the Grammatical Framework (GF). Such CL expressions are then analysed for normative conflicts by the CLAN tool, which gives counter-examples in cases where conflicts are found. The framework also uses GF to give a CNL version of the counter-example, helping the user to identify the conflicts in the original text.

But the effect may not be large. The evidence also supports a “strong form ” of the hypothesis: that this association reflects not increased demand for government, but rather <b>the</b> greater <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>the</b> VAT in raising revenue.

40|$|Abstract: The rise of “Multiple devices per user ” {{computing}} {{model and}} the mobility requirement of moving across physical environments bring great challenges to task migration in four aspects: continuity, transparency, heterogeneity and generality. This paper proposes the concept of “virtual user space”, and establishes a task migration framework based on a virtual user space, called TaskShadow-V, to address these challenges. Virtual user space guarantees the continuity of user tasks and capabilities of migrating across mobile devices. Meanwhile, the context-based mechanism of intelligent migration decision-making is proposed to ensure transparency of task migration. This mechanism employs virtual user space as the migrating granularity and uses context information to automatically make the decisions of migration.

A 16 -processor prototype of the DASH multiprocessor has been operational for the last six months.

40|$|Correspondence {{should be}} {{addressed}} to Dr Holloway. Best practice benchmarking (benchmarking for short) generally refers to the pursuit by organizations of enhanced performance by learning from the successful practices of others. Comparisons of key processes which contribute to organizational success are made – with other parts of the same organization; competitors; or organizations operating comparable processes in a context which is in some way relevant. Benchmarking is a continuous activity, not a one-off project; internal processes are adjusted, performance is monitored, new comparisons are made with the current best performers and further changes are explored, all with the ultimate goal of achieving world class status. Benchmarking continues to grow in popularity in both private and public sector organizations – but does it always produce the desired outcomes?

Because AI techniques have usually been applied in such areas as medicine or engineering rather than visual design, little is known about how design knowledge might differ from knowledge in other fields.
