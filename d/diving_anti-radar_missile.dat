50|$|The ARMAT missile is a {{development}} of the Anglo-French Martel <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile.</b> The Martel was further developed by British Aerospace to give the Sea Eagle anti-ship missile, while Britain adopted ALARM for their new ARM missile. France instead adopted the Exocet as their anti-ship missile in the 1970s, and used the ARMAT as new <b>anti-radar</b> weapon. This <b>missile</b> is unusually slow and huge when compared to western <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles,</b> reflecting the original anti-ship task of the ancestor, the AS.37/AJ.168 Martel.|$|R
50|$|The GAM-67 Crossbow was a jet-powered <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile</b> {{built by}} Northrop's Ventura Division (successor to the Radioplane Company).|$|R
25|$|Work {{began on}} an <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile</b> {{derived from the}} Kh-66 in 1972, using a passive radar seeker and SUR-73 autopilot. The {{long-range}} Kh-31 <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile</b> {{came out of the}} same project. The Kh-27 began state testing on a MiG-27 on 8 August 1975 but did not enter service until 2 September 1980. It was assigned the NATO reporting name AS-12 'Kegler' and in effect it replaced the much heavier Kh-28 (AS-9 'Kyle').|$|R
50|$|Types of purposes. Aircraft, UAVs, helicopters, <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles</b> (detection {{range of}} AGM-88 HARM missile 13 - 15 km), air-launched cruise missiles.|$|R
50|$|The mission {{had been}} due {{to be the first}} using American {{supplied}} AGM-45 Shrike <b>Anti-Radar</b> <b>missiles,</b> which were mounted on the Vulcans using improvised underwing pylons.|$|R
50|$|Probability {{of hitting}} of one rocket is:- Statically flying {{aircraft}} - 0.7-0.9;- Maneuvering aircraft with overdrive to 7-8 G - 0.5-0.7;- Tactical ballistic <b>missiles</b> - 0.5-0.7;- <b>Anti-radar</b> <b>missiles</b> - 0.6-0.8;- Cruise missiles - 0.6-0.8.|$|R
50|$|The {{indigenous}} ASR naval radar uses {{a passive}} electronically scanned array, {{that can be}} deployed on coastlines or afloat, making it less vulnerable to <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles</b> that use radar signals to home in on their target.|$|R
50|$|In 1966, {{the basic}} {{airframe}} was adapted with the seeker from the AGM-45 Shrike and the 250 lb warhead from the Mk. 81 bomb {{to create the}} high-speed AGM-76 Falcon <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile,</b> although this did not see service.|$|R
50|$|The B611MR is a semi-ballistic surface-launched <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile</b> first {{advertised in}} 2014. It uses GPS-inertial {{guidance}} and wideband passive radar. The missile {{is capable of}} flying flattened trajectory and performing pre-programmed maneuvers to reduce the chance of interception.|$|R
50|$|In April 1986, navy Sixth Fleet A-7Es from VA-72 and VA-46 {{embarked}} on board USS America (CV-66) {{also participated in}} Operation El Dorado Canyon, the retaliatory attack on Libya, using HARM and Shrike <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles</b> to protect the naval strike force from SAMs.|$|R
50|$|The initial strikes were {{composed}} of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from ships, Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk stealth bombers with an armament of laser-guided bombs, and aircraft armed with <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles.</b> These first attacks destroyed the air defence network and allowed fighter-bombers to gain air superiority over the country.|$|R
25|$|The Radioplane Q-1 was an American target drone, {{developed}} in the early 1950s for the United States Air Force by the Radioplane Company. Originally powered by a pulsejet engine, then later developed as an improved turbojet-powered aircraft, the Q-1 failed to win the favor of the USAF. However, the aircraft provided {{the basis of the}} GAM-67 Crossbow <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile.</b>|$|R
25|$|According to some reports, {{the missile}} {{was used by}} the Russian Air Force during the South Ossetian {{conflict}} in 2008. In particular, it was reported that on August 10, 2008 a Russian Air Force Su-34 struck a Georgian air defense radar near the city of Gori with Kh-31P <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles.</b> Georgian air defenses were disabled in order to avoid further losses.|$|R
50|$|The initial strikes were {{composed}} of Tomahawk cruise missiles launched from warships {{situated in the}} Persian Gulf, F-117A Nighthawk stealth bombers with an armament of laser-guided smart bombs, and F-4G Wild Weasel aircraft armed with HARM <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles.</b> These first attacks allowed F-14, F-15, F-16, and F/A-18 fighter bombers to gain air superiority {{over the country and}} then continue to drop TV and laser-guided bombs.|$|R
50|$|Tu-16K-26P - {{carrying}} the K-26P <b>missiles</b> (two <b>anti-radar</b> KSR-5P <b>missiles,</b> {{as well as}} KSR-5, 2 or 11).|$|R
25|$|Six YQ-1Bs {{were built}} for evaluation; they proved trouble-free, no {{production}} {{order for the}} type was undertaken, the competing Ryan Q-2 drone having been selected for operational service instead; as a result, the Q-1 program was terminated. However, the YQ-1B airframe was used by Radioplane as the start of {{development of a new}} <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile,</b> which would be tested by the U.S. Air Force as the GAM-67 Crossbow.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is equipped}} with three multifunctional color liquid-crystal displays (seven LCDs on the MiG-29KUB), a four-channel digital fly-by-wire flight control system, passive homing system for <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles,</b> Sigma-95 GPS receiver, TopGun helmet-mounted targeting system and electronic countermeasures (ECM). Additionally, an onboard oxygen generating system {{eliminates the need for}} heavy oxygen canisters. The types of combat missions undertaken by the MiG-29K can be increased by adding optronic/infrared imaging reconnaissance pods.|$|R
50|$|It {{is found}} on the {{aircraft}} carrier Admiral Kuznetsov, Kirov class battlecruisers, Neustrashimy class frigates, China's Sovremenny class destroyers, and other modern designs. Most typically deployed as a combined gun and missile system, it provides defence against anti-ship <b>missiles,</b> <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles</b> and guided bombs. The system can also be employed against fixed- or rotary-wing aircraft or even surface vessels such as fast attack boats or targets on shore.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1940s, the Radioplane Company {{developed}} {{a set of}} prototypes of the Q-1 target series, which used pulsejet or small turbojet engines. Although the Q-1 series was not put into production as a target, it did evolve into the USAF RP-54D / XB-67 / XGAM-67 Crossbow <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile,</b> which was first flown in 1956. It was also considered as a platform for reconnaissance, electronic countermeasures, and decoy roles.|$|R

5|$|In {{addition}} to the order made by the Luftwaffe, the German Navy's Marineflieger also received 112 of the IDS variant in the anti-shipping and marine reconnaissance roles, again replacing the Starfighter. These equipped two wings, each with a nominal strength of 48 aircraft. The principal anti-ship weapon was the AS.34 Kormoran anti-ship missile, which were initially supplemented by unguided bombs and BL755 cluster munitions, and later by AGM-88 HARM <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles.</b> Pods fitted with panoramic optical cameras and an infrared line scan were carried for the reconnaissance mission.|$|R
25|$|Soviet {{offensive}} {{doctrine in}} the early 1960s assumed that widespread {{use of nuclear weapons}} would disable Western radar-based air defence systems through electromagnetic pulses (EMP) effects. Consequently, they paid little attention to the development of <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missiles.</b> However, in January 1963 the Berezniak design bureau (which became MKB Raduga in 1967) was tasked with developing such a missile as part of the K-28P weapon complex based around a 'Wild Weasel' version of the Yak-28 'Brewer' bomber (hence -28; the 'K' stands for kompleks, P stands for protivradiolokatsyonny 'anti-radar').|$|R

5000|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Matra and Hawker Siddeley Dynamics began to {{collaborate}} on a long-range high-power <b>anti-radar</b> <b>missile</b> known as Martel. The idea behind Martel was to allow an aircraft to attack Warsaw Pact surface-to-air missile sites while well outside their range, and it carried a warhead {{large enough to}} destroy the radar even {{in the case of}} a near miss. In comparison to the US AGM-45 Shrike, Martel was far longer ranged, up to 60 km compared to [...] for the early Shrike, and a 150 kg warhead instead of 145 lb.|$|R
