50|$|Exhaust pipes on two {{different}} models of car should be similarly priced, for example. If one costs considerably less than the other, due to sourcing location, raw material, bulk contracts etc., it provides an opportunity to increase price and make the price consistent with other exhausts. Similarly companies may decide to have leader-follower relationships between their service parts, and may require followers to derive prices from leaders. <b>Driver</b> <b>door</b> might be the leader and other doors the followers, priced with a slight mark down. Standard floor mats can be leaders and carpeted mats the followers, priced with an additional mark up.|$|E

5000|$|The {{interior}} of the Lincoln Town Car featured many advanced luxury options for its time. Signature Series and Cartier models featured 6-way power seats (and manual seatback recliners) for the driver and front passenger; the Lincoln Town Car adopted a split front bench seat previously seen on the Mark coupes. Several electronic features included an optional digital-display trip computer showing the driver [...] "miles to empty" [...] and (based on driver input) an [...] "estimated time of arrival". A keypad-based keyless entry system unlocked the vehicle through a 5-digit combination (factory-programmed or owner-programmed). Mounted above the <b>driver</b> <b>door</b> handle, the keypad allowed the driver to lock all four doors; after entering the code, the driver could unlock the doors or release the trunklid. Along with keyfob-based systems, the keypad system is still in use on Ford and Lincoln vehicles (as of 2017).|$|E

5000|$|One way to {{distinguish}} most P71s {{is the small}} [...] "Police Interceptor" [...] badge that replaces the standard [...] "Crown Victoria" [...] markings on the trunk lid, although the Street Appearance Package (SAP) Police Interceptors forego this badge, using the standard Crown Victoria marking. Police Interceptor badges are now available for purchase online, so this identifying technique is not as reliable as it once was. Street Appearance Package (SAP) cars also use chrome trim rather than the black trim of normal Police Interceptors. P71s can also be identified by the dual exhaust and an analog 140 mph speedometer. The Police Interceptor has an additional interior trunk release {{in the center of}} the dashboard with a prominent warning decal right below it, while the civilian version has it only on the driver's door. All 1998 and newer Crown Victorias made for civilian (non-fleet) use have a five digit horizontal keypad (known as SecuriCode) above the driver side door handle which can be used to lock/unlock the car and open its trunk. All P70, 71, and 72 Crown Victorias are assembled without this keyless entry system so unless the <b>driver</b> <b>door</b> was damaged and had an improper replacement door installed any Crown Victoria you see with a keypad is a civilian one, while any one without a keypad is a P70, 71, or 72 fleet Crown Victoria. The only completely infallible way to identify a Police Interceptor is to look for the code [...] "P71" [...] in the VIN, or [...] "P7B", as it was renamed in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|The Mark IV monorails {{were the}} first of the [...] "Learjet" [...] styled monorails used by Disney (long, sleek white trains with mid-level windows). The design was also used for the Mark V (Disneyland), Mark VI (WDW) and {{inspired}} the look of other systems such as the Las Vegas Monorail as well as systems in Asia. Each car featured brown interiors (seat material and carpet) with four double sided and two single (at the front and rear) bench seats which stretched the entire width of the car. The cars were accessed by doors which were automatically opened using a pneumatic system (a loud clunk would be heard and the doors would swing open at the press of a control button {{on the outside of the}} monorail near the <b>driver</b> <b>door)</b> and manually closed by a Cast Member who would walk from one end of the train to the other with his hand out, pushing the doors shut as he walked by). Unlike the current Mark VI trains in use at Disney World, Mark IV's were shorter, the cabins were somewhat narrower, and had no standing room capability. Although the trains were equipped with air conditioning and heating, to help with ventilation, each window could be cracked open with a latch. The pilot's compartments (cabs) were not heated. Passengers in wheel chairs were boarded in the middle door of the third car. The door included an opposite hinged side that allowed the passenger to remain in their chair while boarding. Guests in chairs were boarded using a metal ramp (the floor of the train was several inches higher than that of the station) and one bench seat folded up allowing the chair to be anchored securely for travel without inconvenience to the guest.|$|E
