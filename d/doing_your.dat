500|$|Portman and Kunis started {{training}} {{six months}} before the start of filming in order to attain a body type and muscle tone more similar to those of professional dancers. Portman worked out for five hours a day, doing ballet, cross-training, and swimming. A few months closer to filming, she began choreography training. Kunis engaged in cardio and Pilates, [...] "train seven days a week, five hours, for five, six months total, and ... was put on a very strict diet of 1,200 calories a day." [...] She lost 20 pounds from her normal weight of about 117 pounds, and reported that Portman [...] "became smaller than I did." [...] Kunis said, [...] "I did ballet as a kid like every other kid does ballet. You wear a tutu and you stand on stage and you look cute and twirl. But this is very different because you can't fake it. You can't just stay in there and like pretend you know what you're <b>doing.</b> <b>Your</b> whole body has to be structured differently." [...] Georgina Parkinson, a ballet mistress from the American Ballet Theatre (ABT), coached the actors in ballet. ABT soloists Sarah Lane and Maria Riccetto served as [...] "dance doubles" [...] for Portman and Kunis respectively. Dancer Kimberly Prosa also served as a double for Portman. She stated: [...] "Natalie took class, she studied for several months, from the waist up is her. Sarah Lane a soloist at ABT, did the heavy tricks, she did the fouettés, but they only had her for a limited time, a couple of weeks, so I did the rest of whatever dance shots they needed." ...|$|E
500|$|Very {{was known}} as an eccentric, prone to odd {{behavior}} and may have suffered from bipolar disorder. The first signs of a breakdown came shortly after meeting Emerson, as Very was completing an essay on William Shakespeare. As Very later explained, [...] "I felt within me a new will... {{it was not a}} feeling of my own but a sensible will that was not my own... These two consciousnesses, as I may call them, continued with me". In August 1837, while traveling by train, he was suddenly overcome with terror at its speed until he realized he was being [...] "borne along by a divine engine and undertaking his life-journey". As he told Henry Ware Jr., professor of pulpit eloquence and pastoral care at Harvard Divinity School, divine inspiration helped him suddenly understand the twenty-fourth chapter of the Gospel of Matthew and that Christ was having his Second Coming within him. When Ware did not believe him, Very said, [...] "I had thought you did the will of the Father, and that I should receive some sympathy from you—But I now find that you are <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> own will, and not the will of your father". Very also claimed that he was {{under the influence of the}} Holy Spirit and composed verse while in this state. Emerson did not believe Very's claim and, noting the poor writing, he asked, [...] "cannot the spirit parse & spell?" [...] Very said he was also tormented by strong sexual desires which he believed were only held in check by the will of God. To help control himself, he avoided speaking with or even looking at women—he called it his [...] "sacrifice of Beauty".|$|E

[...] Mike spots nearly all the glaringly obvious issues immediately and brings in his crew to fix what turns into a gigantic electrical/plumbing/HVAC nightmare created by previous attempts at renovation. [...] Among other things, the crew discovers tree roots in the clay basement pipes, a laundry room full of mould, carpenter ants, and an electrical fire that fortunately burned itself out without igniting anything else. [...] One interesting surprise is the discovery of an old and extremely well-constructed well buried in the front yard.|$|E
2500|$|Rival {{networks}} ABC and CBS had discouraged [...] "their stars" [...] from {{appearing on}} The Jay Leno Show in its primetime slot. [...] Julia Louis-Dreyfus (The New Adventures of Old Christine) {{was the first}} CBS actor {{to appear on the}} show, on September 29, 2009; on that episode, she said [...] "there was a little pressure, because as you know you are now on prime time", but that [...] "Obviously, I committed to <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> show and we’re friends". [...] This boycott did not affect The Tonight Show with Conan O'Brien nor was it industry-wide. [...] Other TV networks, like Fox, The CW, and HBO, were more encouraging. [...] Hugh Laurie from the Fox TV show House was a guest on the September 25, 2009, telecast. House is produced by Universal Media Studios, a sister company to NBC through NBC Universal, and Fox does not offer any network programming in the 10 p.m. time slots, instead allowing most of its affiliates to go to local news.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the release}} of the album, Morrison {{performed}} a series of concerts at the Dominion Theatre, London, opened by Herbie Armstrong with an acoustic set. Paul Charles, who managed Morrison's business affairs at the time, commented that [...] "The idea [...] was [...] 'come into town, do one show, get all the press down, get the radio and TV and record-company people' [...] My logic was, 'Look, with Van it's not just a rock & roll tour. It's not just here's the hits, here's the new record, please buy it, whatever.' It was a performance. ... A certain number of people would come back every night, [...] Van will not have a set-list that he adheres to religiously ... So I thought, 'Here's a way. Van is not having any singles. Van doesn't do TV. How can we get attention to him doing what he does?' Well, the best thing that he does is perform live. I think we did four [...] the first time. We ended up doing eleven [...] We got a lot of coverage, {{we got a lot of}} attention, without him having to do something he didn't like." [...] Morrison's love of live performing was reignited by this set of concerts and he commented at the time that it was [...] "more like appearing in a play, going to the theatre and <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> job every day - which I prefer to touring because that's very fragmented and disorientating." [...] According to Johnny Rogan, these performances [...] "are still regarded by many as his most memorable since the glory days of the Caledonia Soul Orchestra. A concert on 3 to 4 April 1982 at the Grugahalle, Essen, Germany, was broadcast in many European countries as a TV/radio simulcast in the Rockpalast TV series by German TV station WDR. Seven of the songs that were performed were from Beautiful Vision.|$|E
