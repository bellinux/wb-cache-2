40|$|In April 2001, the Children and Family Court Advisory Support Service (CAFCASS) became {{responsible}} for family court work, including {{the provision of}} <b>mediation</b> services. <b>Family</b> court <b>mediation</b> offers a gateway for social work with children and families whose needs are largely left untouched by current services, and could thereby play an important part within the broader extension of prevention, early intervention, parenting and support services recommended by government. Over the past two decades, mediation has become a popular approach to reducing conflict and resolving disputes {{in a wide range}} of inter-personal, community and organizational settings. Given the professional interest that social workers have in helping their clients achieve more harmonious lives, the space for mediation would appear considerable and yet the connections between mediation and social work are, as yet, insufficiently mapped and analysed, in terms of both theory and practice.

40|$|There {{are many}} aspects of {{mediation}} that support {{an analysis of the}} process as a feminist approach to dispute resolution. This analysis might be used in terms of justifying the increased use of <b>mediation</b> in <b>family</b> dispute contexts where the number of women disputants is high. Women who are victims of domestic violence, however, face many practical and process disadvantages in <b>family</b> law <b>mediation,</b> and whilst feminist scholarship has enabled {{a better understanding of the}} impact of domestic violence on a victim’s ability to participate effectively in mediation, the rates of participation remain high. This article considers some of the arguments for considering mediation as a feminist model of dispute resolution and contextualises those arguments in terms of their application to the participation of victims of domestic violence in mediation. The article argues that as victims of domestic violence increasingly find themselves in the mediation context, specific strategies are needed to protect their interests and ensure their safety. The article proposes a distinct model of <b>family</b> law <b>mediation</b> for matters where there is a history of domestic violence that centralises the role of a legal advocate for the victim...|$|R
