Saomai somewhat <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> unprecedented {{damage caused by}} Prapiroon, and damaged maize crops which were set to be harvested in the coming weeks.|$|E
5|$|Tallon's {{little left}} finger swelled {{up after the}} Third Test and he <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> injury during a tour match against Middlesex. In this match, he scored 17, took two catches and a stumping in the first innings and conceded only seven byes for the entire match as Australia won by ten wickets.|$|E
5|$|The 1988Bangladesh cyclone struck as Bangladesh was {{recovering}} from what had been considered the worst flood in Bangladeshi history earlier in the year. As a result, the additional effects of the passing cyclone <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> flood's impacts. Beginning two days before landfall, Bangladesh state radio and television continuously broadcast warning signals urging the evacuation of endangered residents along coastal areas.|$|E

5|$|Aristotle Onassis's second {{marriage}} <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> tensions already inherent in {{his relationship with}} his son. He also disapproved of Alexander's secret relationship with Fiona Thyssen (née Campbell Walter), a British fashion model some 16 years his senior and the former wife of industrialist Baron Hans Heinrich Thyssen-Bornemisza. Onassis had first met Fiona Thyssen when he was 12, and as an 18-year-old had surprised his mother by inviting her to a dinner party, as she was one of his mother's friends.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{made two}} {{changes for the}} Test. Harvey {{replaced}} the injured Barnes, while Saggers replaced Tallon behind the stumps. Tallon's little left finger had swelled up after the Third Test and he <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> injury during a tour match against Middlesex. England made three changes. Emmett was dropped after making 10 and a duck on debut and Hutton was recalled to take his opening position. Laker, the off spinner, replaced his left arm finger spinning colleague Young. Dollery, who had made only 38 in three innings, was replaced by all-rounder Cranston.|$|E
5|$|Between 1975 and 1990, real {{per capita}} income fell by more than 20%, wiping out almost three decades of {{economic}} development. The manufacturing industry, which had experienced a period of uninterrupted growth until the mid-1970s, began a process of continuous decline. The extreme dependence on state support of the many protected industries <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> sharp fall of the industrial output. The degree of industrialization {{at the start of}} the 1990s was similar to its level in the 1940s.|$|E

Occupational exposure to silica, pesticides, and mercury can also worsen the disease.|$|R
5|$|In February 1835, Ohio passed {{legislation}} {{that set up}} county governments in the Strip. The county in which Toledo sat would, later in 1835, be named after incumbent Governor Robert Lucas, a move that further <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> growing tensions with Michigan. Also, during this period, Ohio attempted to use its power in Congress to revive a previously rejected boundary bill that would formally set the state border to be the Harris Line.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to proximity and competitiveness, the rivalry {{was fueled by}} controversial incidents {{both on and off}} the field. Maryland supporters long held that Navy players used unnecessary roughness during play, a charge counter-accused by the Academy after the 1963 game. Some Midshipmen would travel to College Park to meet female students, which served to aggravate the ill feelings. Pranks and vandalism were commonplace on both campuses and <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> already tense situation between Maryland and Navy.|$|E

Eiland-Hall wrote {{that he had made}} his point, and the act of filing the complaint <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> situation for the complainant. Eiland-Hall explained his rationale for giving away the domain name, citing his desire to protect the applicability of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution had been satisfied.|$|E

5|$|On {{taking office}} as Chancellor of the Exchequer Brown gave the Bank of England {{operational}} independence in monetary policy, and thus responsibility for setting interest rates through the Bank's Monetary Policy Committee. At {{the same time}} he also changed the inflation measure from the Retail Price Index to the Consumer Price Index and transferred responsibility for banking supervision to the Financial Services Authority. Some commentators have argued that this division of responsibilities <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> severity in Britain of the 2007 global banking crisis.|$|E
5|$|Tallon was {{retained}} as {{the teams}} then played out a {{draw in the}} Third Test at Manchester. During the match, Tallon conceded 16 byes and dropped Denis Compton three times as the English batsman went from 50 to 145 not out. Tallon's little left finger swelled up after the Third Test and he <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> injury during the next tour match against Middlesex, which Australia won by ten wickets.|$|E
5|$|The Great Stink was {{an event}} in central London in July and August 1858 during which the hot weather <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> smell of {{untreated}} human waste and industrial effluent that was present {{on the banks of}} the River Thames. The problem had been mounting for some years, with an ageing and inadequate sewer system that emptied directly into the Thames. The miasma from the effluent was thought to transmit contagious diseases, and three outbreaks of cholera prior to the Great Stink were blamed on the ongoing problems with the river.|$|E

5|$|The city's {{fiscal crisis}} in the 1970s caused {{the rest of the}} park to fall into disrepair. A dearth of funds <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> {{pollution}} of the park. Hands-on education programs at the park were reduced to passive observations of flora and fauna. Elsewhere in the park, excessive foot traffic was eroding the soil in the forests. The stock of younger, replacement trees in the old-growth forest had relatively little diversity compared to other natural forests.|$|E
5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> flood's {{disruption}} to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|By the 1930s, Glynne's {{focus was}} on cereal diseases, {{especially}} soil-borne varieties. She was able {{to prove that the}} lodging or flattening of wheat close to harvest was frequently not the result of wind or rain, but instead caused by take-all and eyespot, both soil-borne fungal diseases. Glynne was able to not only identify the fungal cause and which strains of cereal were less susceptible, but also establish that crop rotation <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> issue. On this basis, she was able to advise which strains of cereal should be planted in the affected fields. Glynne also discovered Gibellina cerealis in 1935, a fungal pathogen thought to be introduced to the UK by Roman settlers.|$|E

5|$|During the Civil War, Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton {{promised a}} Medal of Honor to every {{man in the}} 27th Maine Volunteer Infantry Regiment who {{extended}} his enlistment beyond the agreed-upon date. The Battle of Gettysburg was imminent, and 311 men of the regiment volunteered to serve until the battle was resolved. The remaining men returned to Maine, but with the Union victory at Gettysburg the 311 volunteers soon followed. The volunteers arrived back in Maine in time to be discharged with {{the men who had}} earlier returned. Since {{there seemed to be no}} official list of the 311 volunteers, the War Department <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> situation by forwarding 864 medals to the commanding officer of the regiment. The commanding officer only issued the medals to the volunteers who stayed behind and retained the others on the grounds that, if he returned the remainder to the War Department, the War Department would try to reissue the medals.|$|E
5|$|Having {{exhausted}} {{most of his}} {{resources in}} Pennsylvania helping establish the new United States government, Captain Rowan decided to move the family to the western frontier, where he hoped to start fresh and rebuild his fortune. On October 10, 1783, the Rowans and five other families embarked on a flat bottomed boat near Redstone Creek and began their journey down the Monongahela River toward the Falls of the Ohio. The travelers expected the journey to last a few days at most, but ice along the river slowed the journey, {{and a lack of}} provisions <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> delays. Three of the families disembarked near what is now Maysville, Kentucky; the Rowans would later learn that most of these settlers were killed by Indians. The remaining settlers continued downriver, reaching Louisville, Kentucky on March 10, 1783.|$|E
5|$|Henry now {{appeared}} to his contemporaries {{to be stronger}} than ever, and he was courted as an ally by many European leaders and asked to arbitrate over international disputes in Spain and Germany. He was nonetheless busy resolving some of the weaknesses that he believed had <b>exacerbated</b> <b>the</b> revolt. Henry set about extending royal justice in England to reassert his authority and spent time in Normandy shoring up support amongst the barons. The King also made use of the growing Becket cult to increase his own prestige, using {{the power of the}} saint to explain his victory in 1174, especially his success in capturing William.|$|E
