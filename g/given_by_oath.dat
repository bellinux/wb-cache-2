50|$|An {{eyewitness}} {{testimony is}} a statement <b>given</b> under <b>oath</b> <b>by</b> a person present at an event who can describe what happened. During circumstances in which a child is {{a witness to the}} event, the child can be used to deliver a testimony on the stand. The credibility of a child, however, is often questioned due to their underdeveloped memory capacity and overall brain physiology. Researchers found that eyewitness memory requires high-order memory capacity even for well-developed adult brain. Because a child's brain is not yet fully developed, each child witness must be assessed by the proper authorities to determine their reliability as a witness {{and whether or not they}} are mature enough to accurately recall the event, provide important details and withstand leading questions.|$|R

500|$|Wihtred's {{laws were}} issued at [...] "Berghamstyde"; {{it is not}} known for certain where this was, but the best {{candidate}} is Bearsted, near Maidstone. [...] The laws are primarily concerned with religious affairs; only the last four of its twenty-eight chapters do not deal with ecclesiastical affairs. [...] The first clause of the code gives the Church freedom from taxation. [...] Subsequent clauses specify penalties for irregular marriages, heathen worship, work on the sabbath, and breaking fasts, among other things; and also define how members of each class of society—such as the king, bishops, priests, ceorls, and esnes—can clear themselves <b>by</b> <b>giving</b> an <b>oath.</b> In addition to the focus of the laws themselves, the introduction makes clear the importance of the Church in the legislative process. Bertwald, the Archbishop of Canterbury, was present at the assembly which devised the decrees, and so was Gefmund, the Bishop of Rochester; and [...] "every order of the Church of that nation spoke in unanimity with the loyal people".|$|R
