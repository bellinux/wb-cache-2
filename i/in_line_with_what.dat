5|$|Despite {{its strong}} sales, Final Fantasy XIII had been criticized on several fronts. Complaints {{included}} {{that the game}} had been too linear, had not allowed enough interaction with non-player characters, and had not featured enough minigames and puzzles. The developers intended to address these criticisms with the sequel by adding the Historia Crux system, numerous sidequests from non-player characters, and the casino minigame area. Environments were made more explorable and the artists were given more freedom to include their own ideas in the game's locations, in order to rectify the shortcomings of the more artificial seeming settings in Final Fantasy XIII. Although the developers were explicitly responding to the criticism, they saw the changes and additions as making the sequel <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> players had hoped Final Fantasy XIII would be, rather than backing away from the changes that game had brought to the series. For the structure of side quests and some other aspects such as the abundance of chocobos and the more open environment, the team drew inspiration from Rockstar San Diego's Red Dead Redemption. The game also included multiple endings, which Toriyama {{referred to as a}} first for the series.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{it is very}} difficult, and {{at times}} arguably impossible, to adopt {{the point of view}} of an ideal observer. Individual moral agents do not know {{everything}} about their particular situations, and thus do not know all the possible consequences of their potential actions. For this reason, some theorists have argued that consequentialist theories can only require agents to choose the best action <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> they know about the situation. However, if this approach is naïvely adopted, then moral agents who, for example, recklessly fail to reflect on their situation, and act in a way that brings about terrible results, could be said to be acting in a morally justifiable way. Acting in a situation without first informing oneself of the circumstances of the situation can lead to even the most well-intended actions yielding miserable consequences. As a result, it could be argued that there is a moral imperative for an agent to inform himself as much as possible about a situation before judging the appropriate course of action. This imperative, of course, is derived from consequential thinking: a better-informed agent is able to bring about better consequences.|$|E

500|$|Knowing {{that the}} Sega Saturn {{had been set}} back by its high {{production}} costs and complex hardware, Sega took a different approach with the Dreamcast. Like previous Sega consoles, the Dreamcast was designed around intelligent subsystems working in parallel with one another, but the selections of hardware were more <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> was common in personal computers than video game consoles, reducing the system's cost. According to Damien McFerran, [...] "the motherboard was a masterpiece of clean, uncluttered design and compatibility." [...] Chinese economist and future Sega.com CEO Brad Huang convinced Sega chairman Isao Okawa to include a modem with every Dreamcast despite significant opposition from Okawa's staff over the additional $15 cost per unit. To account for rapid changes in home data delivery, Sega designed the Dreamcast's modem to be modular. Sega selected the GD-ROM media format for the system. The GD-ROM, which was jointly developed by Sega and Yamaha Corporation, could be mass-produced at a similar price to a normal CD-ROM, thus avoiding the greater expense of DVD-ROM technology. As the GD-ROM format can hold about 1 GB of data, illegally copying Dreamcast games onto a 650 MB CD-ROM sometimes required the removal of certain game features, although this did not prevent copying of Dreamcast software. Microsoft developed a custom Dreamcast version of Windows CE with DirectX API and dynamic-link libraries, {{making it easy to}} port PC games to the platform, although programmers would ultimately favor Sega's development tools over those from Microsoft.|$|E

40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} based on the business industry and its view on inland waterways {{as a part of the}} infrastructure within the region of Västra Götaland (hereinafter referred to as VGR). When it comes to transporting goods within national boarders, inland shipping in Sweden is used to a much lesser extent compared to both road and railway. There are countries in central Europe that use inland waterways as a complement to additional infrastructure with seemingly good results. In order to handle the constant increase of general transportation of goods on a global level, Sweden is required to use all available resources in an efficient way connected to every means of inland transportation. Therefore, it is interesting to research whether or not there exists a genuine interest among the local companies in using a functioning inland shipping network for transportation along river Göta Älv and Lake Vänern. <b>In</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> this, investigating <b>what</b> the industry’s point of view is concerning the usage of inland shipping as a part of the logistical network, as well as what practical arrangements the region itself would have to solve in order to commit the companies to future investments is also a matter of interest. Through a case study with in-person semi structured interviews, the authors of this report examined different companies’ interest and commitment regarding the development of inland shipping. Furthermore, through an interview with Kristina Jonäng who is a representative for the political party "Centerpartiet" in VGR, the approach from the region of Västra Götaland concerning this means of transportation and its future relevance was analysed. The result of the case study offers the conclusion that there is an almost exclusively positive approach towards the usage of inland shipping among the interviewed companies. The major obstacle mentioned was connected to an inadequate infrastructure and increased lead time. However, an extensive majority of the respondents would consider using inland waterways if it was a fully functional alternative for transporting goods. A large number of companies also mentioned that through an extended use of inland shipping, this could help in reaching internally set environmental goals...|$|R

[...] He {{is said to have}} painted Sigismunda {{mourning}} over the Heart of Guiscardo with the aim of proving that he could equal works of the [...] "Old Italian Masters", and intending the painting to be one of his masterpieces. In the leg of the table in the painting, a turbaned, pug-nosed figure is carved, emerging from the ornate decoration, which is reminiscent of Hogarth's self-portrait The Artist Painting the Comic Muse from around 1757, and is perhaps Hogarth's attempt to insert himself bodily into the picture, thereby making an overt connection between himself and the Old Masters. In 1758, Sir Thomas Sebright, 5th Baronet had paid £405.5s in an Old Master auction for a painting of Sigismunda supposedly by Correggio. Hogarth doubted the attribution and was later proved correct: the painting is now considered to be by Francesco Furini. Nevertheless, Hogarth priced his Sigismunda <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> was paid for the [...] "Correggio" [...] version and commensurate with the time he had spent creating it – at least two hundred days (although it appears he was also working on finishing Piquet during this period) – and this may have contributed to Grosvenor's eventual loss of interest.

500|$|Batman: Arkham Asylum {{was first}} {{announced}} in August 2008; {{it was developed}} by British studio Rocksteady Studios {{under the aegis of}} Eidos Interactive and Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment. Eidos obtained the rights to make a Batman game in spring 2007, and approached then little-known Rocksteady after viewing the developer's prototype. At Eidos' request, Rocksteady presented their approach to the Batman license, and by May 2007, they had begun developing the game's concept, with full production beginning in September. Writer Paul Dini ( [...] , Detective Comics) was first approached by DC Comics around late 2007 about the prospect of creating a story for an original Batman video game. Dini found the idea intriguing, believing that few Batman games were based on an original idea, instead being adapted from film or television. DC Comics asked Dini what his approach to writing a new Batman film or graphic novel would be, but one that was designed for gameplay. He later met with the Rocksteady team, where it was decided that Dini's ideas were <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> <b>what</b> Rocksteady wanted to achieve. By the time Dini joined the project, Rocksteady were investigating the idea of setting the game within Arkham, and had produced preliminary designs depicting it as a huge estate on an island connected to mainland Gotham City by a bridge. The cast had not been finalized, but given the setting it was certain that the Joker would play a large role. The game and story were developed together, with the limitations of mechanics requiring the story to be built around them. The core aim was to make the game engaging enough for players to spend 8–10 hours completing it, especially those uninterested in Batman-franchised media. Rocksteady would guide Dini when they thought he was writing too much story or character motivation.|$|E

30|$|How {{then the}} {{equilibrium}} of Confucian self {{with that of}} nature can be located? There are many Chinese scholars who express their nationalist fervor {{in response to the}} historical Western imperialism in calling for their own modernity as an alternate peaceful rise by avoiding exploitative nature inherently present in the modernity. However the necessary harmony of the self with the nature has been destroyed in the process of catching up with the West. The two “H” (Harmony and Hierarchy) are now the victim of modern market consumption culture. Deeply ingrained hedonism in the Capitalist self is contrary to the moderate self that Confucian self-cultivation entails. China in the Global South is becoming a place where Capitalism explodes consumption obsession in the market with even more force than in other societies. This is reflected by the massive consumption culture at the societal level and State’s quest of power through progress and development. Besides other consequences, emphasis on materialism, consumerism, and hedonism has also resulted into sexual anomie in China affecting intimate relationship between husband and wife thus discrediting it the worth it has always had for Confucian culture (Yang and Neal 2006 : 116). The expanding wants and desires growing out of increased personal freedom has resulted in a weakening of the normative restraints previously demanded by traditional Chinese society (Yang and Neal 2006 : 116). This hedonism has been {{explained by the fact that}} consumers are not really buying a better world, they are buying the sense of pleasure that comes with the illusion that they are buying a better world (Hickle and Khan 2012 : 218). According to Badiou, though he champions communism, this competitiveness is a war dictated by self-interest and turns itself into animality which is the other name of competition in Capitalism (McGowan 2013 : 9). It is not the modern economic man which owns Capital rather the Capital which owns the economic man. What else lies in the East than hollow fantasy about civilizational admiration of past when the questions of vice and virtue are abandoned and when greatness by means of material growth eventually becomes an end itself. Rephrasing in different words the famous Chinese proverb Deng used, it does not matter then what constitutes vice or virtue <b>in</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> traditional ethos; <b>what</b> matters is as long as one could serve Capital one is virtuous.|$|R
40|$|Title:		Every second week. A {{study on}} how co-parented {{children}} do family. The {{aim of the}} study is to explore children’s day-to-day experiences of co-parenting. It focuses on how the children actively participate in the process of shaping family life and their own childhoods in the context of family change. The study addresses the following questions: •	What characterizes co-parented childhood? •	What are the children’s day-to-day experiences of co-parenting? How are they doing family? •	How do the children talk about their family and family life? The study is based on a qualitative method and consists of semi-structured interviews with eight co-parented children aged nine to thirteen. The starting point is the view of children as social actors and hence involved in interactions, negotiations and the construction of their social worlds. Thus the theoretical framework is based on the sociology of childhood, as well as the theoretical concepts of doing family, family practices and negotiation. These children’s experiences take place in the context of late modern society where family life is being transformed by changes in family structures, due to for example high rates of divorce. After the parental separation the children have to find new ways of living, sharing their time between their two parents on a 50 - 50 basis. Co-parenting is one among several models of post-divorce family life, and is an arrangement increasing rapidly in Sweden. Since it is a rather new model, no templates exist of what it should be like. Accordingly, these children are engaged in shaping –and displaying- new ways of doing family and creating new kinds of family relationships. The children conceptualize family in terms of relationships rather than blood ties or legal ties. Furthermore, in their view a family is based on practices and a common home (or in this case, one with each parent). According to these children, what is most important is the quality of the relationships. <b>In</b> <b>line</b> <b>with</b> this argument, <b>what</b> matters to them is being able to keep a close relationship with both their parents, which they stress is only possible as long as they share an everyday life. Despite the fact that the children themselves construct families based on ties of love and affection, most of them with open boundaries, they still voice the concept of the nuclear family when it comes to spontaneous reactions or describing their possible future family. Thus there are large contrasts between the open family boundaries of their own families and the nuclear family norm, which after all is present in their narratives. This indicates a complex relationship between personal views and underlying norms. One conclusion is that these children are pioneers as they {{are in the process of}} constructing new ways of doing family; co-parented family...|$|R
