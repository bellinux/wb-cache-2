5|$|Lisa {{complains}} to Marge that Homer {{never gets}} involved with her interests. Marge suggests that Lisa {{take an interest}} in something her <b>father</b> <b>does,</b> so she decides to join Homer on the couch while he is watching football on television. After being ripped off by a premium rate betting advice hotline, a desperate Homer turns to Lisa to pick a winner. She picks the Miami Dolphins, prompting Homer to call Moe's Tavern to place his $50 bet. In the end, the Dolphins win, and Homer and Lisa celebrate. Meanwhile, Marge takes Bart shopping for new clothes that the bullies taunt him for.|$|E
5|$|Lucas {{was born}} on November 3, 1982 in Oklahoma. He attends Smith College, a private, women-only college in Massachusetts. Lucas is a {{neuroscience}} major in his senior year; he has fought for transgender rights for his entire college career. He has not yet started hormone replacement therapy, and is cautious about it. Lucas' parents are divorced; his mother and brother {{know that he is}} trans, but his <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not. Lucas plays guitar in a punk band, and lives in an apartment with his friend Kasey, a trans man who has been on HRT for eight months.|$|E
5|$|Later in {{the evening}} Jess becomes {{frustrated}} when he finds that May Belle has drawn in his notebook, but his strict yet caring father (Robert Patrick) sides with her. He later watches them gardening together, disappointed that his <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not spend time with him. Moreover, his mother cherishes her daughter more than him. The next day at school, Leslie compliments Jess' drawing ability, and they soon become friends. After school, they venture {{into the woods and}} swing across a creek on a rope. Jess and Leslie find an abandoned tree house on the other side, and invent a new world, which they call Terabithia. The fantasy world, which is a reflection on their lives, comes to life through their eyes as they explore the surroundings. For the next few days, Jess and Leslie spend their free time in the tree house getting to know each other.|$|E

25|$|A {{child must}} never put {{a parent to}} shame, or speak arrogantly to a parent. A person who is told to do {{something}} by his/her mother for which his <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not like the result is not permitted to tell his/her father that his/her mother said to do that. This is because this could lead to his/her father cursing his/her mother. A child is not permitted to interrupt or contradict a parent, or to disturb a parent's sleep.|$|E
30|$|Father’s worklessness is not {{associated}} with having lower wages or less secure contracts. However, if a young adult’s <b>father</b> <b>did</b> not work when they were younger, {{they are less likely}} to be satisfied with their job. This could indicate that employment itself is experienced differently as similar objective conditions in terms of contract type and wage coincide with lower job satisfaction if someone’s <b>father</b> <b>did</b> not work rather than if the father was employed. Alternatively, the experienced jobs could differ between those whose fathers worked and those whose <b>fathers</b> <b>did</b> not in characteristics that are not observed.|$|R
30|$|The rising worklessness {{among young}} people {{highlights}} that studying job quality without taking employment into account misses a substantial aspect of economic disadvantage. Studying them separately obscures {{a part of the}} effect of early disadvantage, such as paternal worklessness. This paper shows that young adults whose <b>father</b> <b>did</b> not work when at age 14 {{are less likely to be}} employed themselves. When employed, they tend to work fewer hours and work part-time more often than their counterparts whose <b>fathers</b> <b>did</b> work. This difference remains even when comparing children whose <b>fathers</b> <b>did</b> not work with those whose fathers worked in a lower paying occupation.|$|R

Her mother later tells Gracie that she would have liked to become a surgeon, but that option had not been available to her as a woman.|$|E
25|$|R. B. Bennett's {{family was}} poor, {{subsisting}} {{mainly on the}} produce of a small farm. His early days inculcated a lifelong habit of thrift. The driving force in his family was his mother. She was a Wesleyan Methodist and passed this faith and the Protestant ethic on to her son. Bennett's <b>father</b> <b>does</b> {{not appear to have}} been a good provider for his family, though the reason is unclear. He operated a general store for a while and tried to develop some gypsum deposits.|$|E
25|$|Juvenile Banggai {{cardinalfish}} do not {{go through}} any pelagic larval phase. Instead, they experience a high growth rate. Although the free embryos maintain their size difference after hatching, they grow several folds while being brooded inside their father’s mouth. Therefore, at release, juveniles are many times heavier than they were at hatching. Juveniles settle directly within the parents’ habitat upon release from their father’s mouth. They form a tight school around different structures such as sea urchins, corals and anemones and swim around together while the <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not exhibit much caring behavior.|$|E

25|$|In Scandinavia, {{family names}} often, but {{certainly}} not always, originate from a patronymic. In Denmark and Norway, the corresponding ending is -sen, as in Karlsen. Names ending with dotter/datter (daughter), such as Olofsdotter, are rare but occurring, and only apply to women. Today, the patronymic names are passed on similarly to family names in other Western countries, and a person's <b>father</b> <b>does</b> {{not have to be}} called Karl if he or she has the surname Karlsson. However, in 2006 Denmark reinstated patronymic and matronymic surnames as an option. Thus, parents Karl Larsen and Anna Hansen can name a son Karlssøn or Annasøn and a daughter Karlsdatter or Annasdatter.|$|E
25|$|Also cut was {{the role}} of Miss Persimmon, played by Marjorie Eaton in the film. The bank chairman's <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not make an {{appearance}} like in the film, nor does Mr. Binnacle, Admiral Boom's assistant. New characters were developed {{to create a new}} conflict at the bank, the nice John Northbrook and scheming Herr Von Hussler. The park keeper from the books is in the musical but not the film. Another character from the books that is in the musical is Robertson Ay, the houseboy, who did not appear in the film. In the books, Jane and Michael have twin siblings, John and Barbara, and a baby sister Annabel, that do not appear in the stage or screen versions.|$|E
25|$|Cameron James, a new {{student at}} Padua High School in the Seattle area, becomes {{instantly}} smitten with popular sophomore Bianca Stratford. Geeky Michael Eckman warns him that Bianca is vapid and conceited, {{and that her}} overprotective <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not allow Bianca or her older sister, the shrewish Kat, to date. Kat, a senior, is accepted to Sarah Lawrence College in New York, but her father, Walter, wants her {{to stay close to}} home. Bianca wishes to date affluent senior Joey Donner, but Walter, an obstetrician worrisome of teenage pregnancy, will not allow his daughters to date until they graduate. Frustrated by Bianca's insistence and Kat's rebelliousness, Walter declares that Bianca may date only when Kat does, knowing that Kat's antisocial attitude makes this unlikely.|$|E
30|$|To {{test whether}} {{respondents}} whose <b>fathers</b> <b>did</b> not work experience worklessness differently {{than their peers}} whose fathers worked, the association of being out of work with overall wellbeing is studied. If young adults whose <b>fathers</b> <b>did</b> not work experience worklessness as less negative, a weaker association between being {{out of work and}} dissatisfaction with overall life is expected for these respondents.|$|R

25|$|There {{is also no}} {{scene of}} a death in Laura’s {{household}} grounds, nor any party described in them, and after finding her Grenouille does not visit her again until his preparations are complete. Instead, the novel describes Grenouille as deciding to kill his second victim {{in much the same}} manner as the first - purely because of an overwhelming impulse to possess her scent. His other victims are also killed purely for the purpose of practicing human scent preservation and perhaps because of the youthful appearance they all share, somewhat reminiscent of Laura, rather than for their perfume-related qualities or to combine with hers. The final perfume he creates in the book is a combination of ingredients, none of which are described except that from Laura. Laura's <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not encounter Grenouille until the latter is imminently to be executed, and there is no torture scene described in the book in which he is present.|$|E
500|$|Aly Michalka as Charlotte Barnes, popular ex-cheerleader {{and senior}} {{at the high}} school that Will attends. We are told later in the film that her ailing <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not approve of how she only runs with the [...] "Populars" [...] in school. [...] Charlotte makes a vow to forsake the populars and run with the geekier teens like Will and Sa5m in hopes that this good {{behavior}} will cause her dad to get well. She terms this an [...] "experiment". [...] Her efforts to start a new band ("I Can't Go On, I'll Go On"), include making Will the manager and coach of the eight musicians that make up their newly formed group. Old boyfriend, Ben Wheatley, surfaces several times in the movie attempting to woo Charlotte back.|$|E
500|$|Throughout 33 {{studies on}} gender differences, a small {{significant}} effect (r = [...]06) {{has been found}} indicating that a base-rate of 10% more females are able to delay rewards than males, which is the typical percentage of difference found between the sexes on measures such as personality or social behavior. This effect {{may be related to}} the slight gender differences found in delay discounting (i.e., minimizing the value of a delayed reward) and higher levels of impulsivity and inattention in boys. Further studies are needed to analyze if this minute difference begins at a certain age (e.g., puberty) or if it has a stable magnitude throughout the lifespan. Some researchers suggest this gender difference may correspond with a mother's tendency to sacrifice her wants and needs in order to meet those of her child more frequently than a <b>father</b> <b>does.</b>|$|E

500|$|Rosenbloom's film {{differed}} from Naylor's novel in several key aspects. In the novel, Marty's family is poor and economic opportunities are limited. The family's four-room homestead is ancient {{and has not}} seen remodeling in decades. In the film, the family is wealthy and there are numerous economic opportunities. The family's two-story house is a [...] "stunning showplace of hardwoods, elegant color schemes, and tasteful appointments". Marty makes money very quickly by doing various chores. By transforming Marty's family from being poor to being well off, Rosenbloom makes the conflict between Marty and Judd an emotional, instead of an economic one. In the novel, Marty and his family hunt animals, while in the film, his <b>father</b> <b>does</b> not hunt. Author Timothy Morris states that [...] "he force of the film's ideology is to blur all distinctions between humans and animals". Judd is transformed from a native in the novel into an interloper in the film who holds the contrarian view that humans and animals are different, that [...] "nimals were put here for us. They ain' got no other purpose or feelin's." ...|$|E
500|$|Marceline and her father, Hunson Abadeer, {{have trouble}} {{accepting}} one another. Initially, Marceline feels that her <b>father</b> <b>does</b> {{not care for}} her, and expresses her feelings through the before-mentioned [...] "Fry Song". Although they admit to loving each other, Abadeer constantly pressures Marceline {{to follow in the}} family business and take over ruling the Nightosphere, a prospective job Marceline does not want. Marceline and the Ice King also have a complicated relationship. In the episode [...] "I Remember You", it is revealed that the Ice King—then, the human man named Simon Petrikov—discovered her crying in the ruins of a city destroyed by the Mushroom Wars. It was Simon who gave little Marceline Hambo and attempted to watch over her. This kind gesture made the Ice King a long-time close friend and father figure to Marceline. However, as the crown's power increased, Simon began to forget more and more about his relationship with Marceline, until he had all but forgotten their friendship. Former storyboard artist and current supervising director for the series Adam Muto explained that Marceline and the Ice King's history {{was not part of the}} series' initial plan, but something that [...] "evolved from [...] original course and it will likely continue to evolve in the future." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbauld also {{collaborated with}} her brother John Aikin on the six-volume series Evenings at Home (1793). It is a {{miscellany}} of stories, fables, dramas, poems, and dialogues. In many ways this series encapsulates the ideals of an Enlightenment education: [...] "curiosity, observation, and reasoning." [...] For example, the stories encourage learning science through hands-on activities; in [...] "A Tea Lecture" [...] the child learns that tea-making is [...] "properly an operation of chemistry" [...] and lessons on evaporation, and condensation follow. The text also emphasises rationality; in [...] "Things by Their Right Names," [...] a child demands that his father tell him a story about [...] "a bloody murder." [...] The <b>father</b> <b>does</b> so, {{using some of the}} fictional tropes of fairy tales such as [...] "once upon a time", but confounding his son with details, such as the murderers all [...] "had steel caps on." [...] In the end the child realises his father has told him the story of a battle, and his father comments [...] "I do not know of any murders half so bloody." [...] Both the tactic of defamiliarising the world to force the reader to think about it rationally and the anti-war message of this tale are prevalent throughout Evenings at Home. In fact, Michelle Levy, a scholar of the period, has argued that the series encouraged readers to [...] "become critical observers of and, where necessary, vocal resisters to authority." [...] This resistance is learned and practised in the home; according to Levy, [...] "Evenings at Home ... makes the claim that social and political reform must begin in the family." [...] It is families that are responsible for the nation's progress or regress.|$|E
