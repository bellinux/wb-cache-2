40|$|Background: Calls {{have been}} made for {{increased}} access to individual participant data (IPD) from clinical trials, to ensure that complete evidence is available. However, despite the obvious benefits, progress towards this is frustratingly slow. In the meantime, many systematic reviews have already collected IPD from clinical trials. We propose that a <b>central</b> <b>repository</b> for these IPD should be established to ensure that these datasets are safeguarded and made available for use by others, building on the strengths and advantages of the collaborative groups that have been brought together in developing the datasets. Objective: Evaluate the level of support, and identify major issues, for establishing a <b>central</b> <b>repository</b> of IPD. Design: On-line survey with email reminders. Participants: 71 reviewers affiliated with the Cochrane Collaboration’s IPD Meta-analysis Methods Group were invited to participate. Results: 30 (42 %) invitees responded: 28 (93 %) {{had been involved in}} an IPD review and 24 (80 %) had been involved in a randomised trial. 25 (83 %) agreed that a <b>central</b> <b>repository</b> was a good idea and 25 (83 %) agreed that they would provide their IPD for central storage. Several benefits of a <b>central</b> <b>repository</b> were noted: safeguarding and standardisation of data, increased efficiency of IPD meta-analyses, knowledge advancement, and facilitating future clinical, and methodologica...|$|R
