5|$|Clarinet {{bodies have}} been made {{from a variety of}} {{materials}} including wood, plastic, hard rubber, metal, resin, and ivory. The vast majority of clarinets used by professionals are made from African hardwood, mpingo (African Blackwood) or grenadilla, rarely (because of diminishing supplies) Honduran rosewood and sometimes even cocobolo. Historically other woods, notably boxwood, were used. Most inexpensive clarinets are made of plastic resin, such as ABS. Resonite is Selmer's trademark name for its type of plastic. Metal soprano clarinets were popular in the early 20th century until plastic instruments supplanted them; metal construction is still used for the bodies of some contra-alto and contrabass clarinets and the necks and bells of nearly all alto and larger clarinets. Ivory was used for a few 18th-century clarinets, but it tends to crack and does not keep its shape well. Buffet Crampon's Greenline clarinets are made from a composite of grenadilla wood powder and carbon fiber. Such clarinets are less affected by humidity and temperature changes than wooden instruments but are heavier. Hard rubber, such as <b>ebonite,</b> has been used for clarinets since the 1860s, although few modern clarinets are made of it. Clarinet designers Alastair Hanson and Tom Ridenour are strong advocates of hard rubber. Hanson Clarinets of England manufactures clarinets using a grenadilla compound reinforced with <b>ebonite,</b> known as 'BTR' (bithermal reinforced) grenadilla. This material is also not affected by humidity, and the weight is {{the same as that of}} a wooden clarinet.|$|E

25|$|In 1981 <b>Ebonite</b> began {{manufacturing}} {{the very}} first urethane cover stock bowling balls and sold the rights to AMF. <b>Ebonite</b> produced AMF balls at that time. <b>Ebonite</b> {{did not believe that}} bowlers would pay the $80.00 price this new technology would demand. That ball became the AMF Angle and this one coverstock change allowed the ball to get a better grip on the urethane finishes used on natural wood lane surfaces, which changed the nature of the bowling game significantly. Then in 1991, Nu-Line Industries produced the X-Calibur, a reactive resin cover. Part-time professional Steve Cooper was the owner and president of the corporation. But production lagged in the early days, allowing firms like Storm, Brunswick and Columbia to enter the reactive market by the following summer. The race to create more and more dynamic balls was on.|$|E

5000|$|In {{response}} to an unprovoked nuclear attack from the planet Ebon, a group of soldiers—representing Unified Earth—is sent to fight the enemy on their alien world. Captured en route to Ebon, the soldiers undergo physical and psychological torture and interrogation {{at the hands of}} the <b>Ebonites,</b> who possess the ability to control the five senses. The prisoners become suspicious of each other when their captors claim they have received cooperation in obtaining military secrets, which is further complicated by each one's past and ethnic origins, along with the unexpected appearance of high-ranking Earth officers among the hostile aliens. The earthmen are subjected to various interactive images of relatives and friends, which have been implanted in their minds during questioning, allowing them to feel a false sense of security, or to instill deeply hidden emotional conflicts. In the end, it is revealed that all of this is but a military [...] "game", organized by the Earth officers to test their troops' loyalty and valor under intense interrogation and psychological stress. The Earth-Ebon war itself is a fake, as the Ebonites' initial bombardment was unintentional. Unexpected accidents and deaths having occurred during the test, the Ebonites—who are, actually, a peaceful and honorable alien civilization—eventually ask for such an immoral and inhuman experimentation to end at once; but, nonetheless, fail to prevent one last man from being killed...one of the conspiring Earth officers thought to be an illusion created by the <b>Ebonites</b> to trick the captives into revealing more information.|$|R
5000|$|Tucker {{was born}} in the Waltham Park Road area of Kingston, Jamaica in 1946. His first {{recording}} session was for producer and sound system operator King Edwards, which resulted in [...] "She's Mine"; It was never released but was played exclusively on Edwards' sound system. Tucker relocated to Birmingham, England in 1961 to join his father. He joined The <b>Ebonites</b> while still at school and toured with the band. He moved to London in 1969 and began working with producer Laurel Aitken, adopting the stage name Winston Groovy. He had minor hits with [...] "Yellow Bird" [...] and [...] "Standing on the Corner" [...] and had his first big hit with the Lee [...] "Scratch" [...] Perry-produced [...] "I Wanna Be Loved". With Aitken, he recorded a reggae version of Rufus Thomas' [...] "Funky Chicken". Further 1970s singles included a cover version of Dr. Hook's [...] "Sylvia's Mother", [...] "Oh My My", [...] "I've Got a Nose for Trouble", and [...] "Please Don't Make Me Cry", recorded in 1970 for Eddy Grant's Torpedo label.|$|R

25|$|The United States, meanwhile, saw league bowling soar in the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s—partially {{influenced}} by popular professional bowlers Don Carter, Dick Weber, Carmen Salvino and Earl Anthony. The number of sanctioned bowling alleys in the U.S. peaked at about 12,000 in the mid-1960s, while {{membership in the}} American Bowling Congress also peaked at just under 4.6million male bowlers. The popularity of the sport in America was perhaps no more evident than when Don Carter became the first athlete of any kind to sign a US$1million endorsement contract, inking a multi-year deal with <b>Ebonite</b> International in 1964. By comparison, Arnold Palmer earned just $5,000 in 1961 endorsing Wilson golf equipment, and NFL quarterback Joe Namath made just $10,000 in 1968 to famously shave off his moustache with a Schick razor.|$|E
25|$|A modern beginner's bassoon is {{generally}} made of maple, with medium-hardness types such as sycamore maple and sugar maple preferred. Less-expensive models are also made of {{materials such as}} polypropylene and <b>ebonite,</b> primarily for student and outdoor use; metal bassoons {{were made in the}} past but have not been produced by any major manufacturer since 1889. The bore of the bassoon is conical, like that of the oboe and the saxophone, and the two adjoining bores of the boot joint are connected {{at the bottom of the}} instrument with a U-shaped metal connector. Both bore and tone holes are precision-machined, and each instrument is finished by hand for proper tuning. The walls of the bassoon are thicker at various points along the bore; here, the tone holes are drilled at an angle to the axis of the bore, which reduces the distance between the holes on the exterior. This ensures coverage by the fingers of the average adult hand. Wooden instruments are lined with hard rubber along the interior of the wing and boot joints to prevent damage from moisture; wooden instruments are also stained and varnished. The end of the bell is usually fitted with a ring, either of metal, plastic or ivory. The joints between sections consist of a tenon fitting into a socket; the tenons are wrapped in either cork or string as a seal against air leaks. The bocal connects the reed to the rest of the instrument and is inserted into a socket at the top of the wing joint. Bocals come in many different lengths and styles, depending on the desired tuning and playing characteristics.|$|E

2500|$|In December 1943 Young {{returned}} to the Basie fold for a 10-month stint, cut short by his being drafted into the army during World War II (see below). Recordings made during this and subsequent periods suggest Young was beginning to make much greater use of a plastic reed, which tended to give his playing a somewhat heavier, breathier tone (although still quite smooth {{compared to that of}} many other players). While he never abandoned the cane reed, he used the plastic reed a significant share of the time from 1943 until the end of his life. Another cause for the thickening of his tone around this time was a change in saxophone mouthpiece from a metal Otto Link to an <b>ebonite</b> Brilhart. In August 1944 Young appeared alongside drummer Jo Jones, trumpeter Harry [...] "Sweets" [...] Edison, and fellow tenor saxophonist Illinois Jacquet in Gjon Mili's short film Jammin' the Blues.|$|E
2500|$|Multiple disk {{machines}} and [...] "triplex" [...] electrostatic machines (generators with three disks) were also developed extensively {{around the turn}} of the 20th century. In 1900, F. Tudsbury discovered that enclosing a generator in a metallic chamber containing compressed air, or better, carbon dioxide, the insulating properties of compressed gases enabled a greatly improved effect to be obtained owing to the increase in the breakdown voltage of the compressed gas, and reduction of the leakage across the plates and insulating supports. In 1903, Alfred Wehrsen patented an <b>ebonite</b> rotating disk possessing embedded sectors with button contacts at the disk surface. In 1907, Heinrich Wommelsdorf reported a variation of the Holtz machine using this disk and inductors embedded in celluloid plates (DE154175; [...] "Wehrsen machine"). [...] Wommelsdorf also developed several high-performance electrostatic generators, of which the best known were his [...] "Condenser machines" [...] (1920). These were single disk machines, using disks with embedded sectors that were accessed at the edges.|$|E
2500|$|The {{saxophone}} mouthpiece {{is larger}} {{than that of the}} clarinet, has a wider inner chamber, and lacks the cork-covered tenon because the saxophone neck inserts into the mouthpiece whereas the clarinet mouthpiece is inserted into the barrel. Saxophone and clarinet embouchures differ from each other in firmness, position of the lower lip, and range of entry angles. [...] The [...] "long tones" [...] exercise is used to develop embouchure, along with airstream and breath control. Mouthpieces come {{in a wide variety of}} materials, including vulcanized rubber (sometimes called hard rubber or <b>ebonite),</b> plastic, and metals such as bronze or surgical steel. Less common materials that have been used include wood, glass, crystal, porcelain, and even bone. According to Larry Teal, the mouthpiece material has little, if any, effect on the sound, and the physical dimensions give a mouthpiece its tone colour. There are examples of [...] "dark" [...] sounding metal pieces and [...] "bright" [...] sounding hard rubber pieces – Marcel Mule, for example, used a metal mouthpiece to perform classical music. [...] Some contend that instability at the mouthpiece/neck connection moves harmonic frequencies off series with the fundamental frequency and each other, resulting in a [...] "spread" [...] sound, and that the weight of a metal mouthpiece counteracts that instability, increasing tonal [...] "focus." [...] Mouthpiece design has a profound impact on tone. Early mouthpieces were designed to produce a warm and round sound for classical playing. Among classical mouthpieces, those with a concave ("excavated") chamber are more true to Adolphe Sax's original design; these provide a softer or less piercing tone favored by some saxophonists, including students of Sigurd Raschèr, for classical playing. Saxophonists who follow the French school of classical saxophone playing, influenced by Marcel Mule, generally use mouthpieces with smaller chambers than Rascher style mouthpieces. The use of the saxophone in dance orchestras and jazz ensembles put a premium on dynamic range, projection, and tonal richness, leading to rapid innovation in chamber shape and tip design, and metal construction. [...] At the opposite extreme from the classical mouthpieces are those with a small chamber and a low clearance above the reed between the tip and the chamber, called high baffle. These produce a bright sound with maximum projection, suitable for having a sound stand out among amplified instruments and typical of modern pop and smooth jazz. Most saxophonists who play different styles have a mouthpiece suited for each style.|$|E
