25|$|Eating rough foods (e.g., crisps) {{can damage}} {{the lining of the}} mouth. Some people cause damage inside their mouths themselves, either through an absentminded habit or as a type of {{deliberate}} self-harm (factitious ulceration). Examples include biting the cheek, tongue, or lips, or rubbing a fingernail, pen, or toothpick inside the mouth. Tearing (and subsequent ulceration) of the upper labial <b>frenum</b> may be a sign of child abuse (non-accidental injury). Iatrogenic ulceration can also occur during dental treatment, when incidental abrasions to the soft tissues of the mouth are common. Some dentists apply a protective layer of petroleum jelly to the lips before carrying out dental work to minimize the number of incidental injuries.|$|E
50|$|A <b>frenum</b> {{piercing}} {{is a type}} of {{body piercing}} located {{on the underside of the}} shaft of the penis. A series of parallel <b>frenum</b> piercings is known as a <b>frenum</b> ladder. A <b>frenum</b> ladder may be extended to include lorum piercings, hafada piercings and guiche piercings.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frenum</b> piercings {{are almost}} always pierced {{perpendicular}} to the shaft of the penis. They may be pierced through the <b>frenum</b> that connects {{the head of the}} penis to the shaft, or anywhere further down the shaft of the penis. Less commonly, <b>frenum</b> piercings may be pierced along the top or even the sides of the shaft of the penis. The <b>Frenum</b> piercing is the 2nd most popular to the Prince Albert(PA) piercing.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Frenum</b> Ladder, {{also known}} as a Jacob's Ladder, {{consists}} of a series of <b>frenum</b> piercings often extending from below the head of the penis {{and as far as the}} base of the shaft of the penis.|$|E
5000|$|A {{frenulum}} (or <b>frenum,</b> plural: frenula or frena, {{from the}} Latin frēnulum, [...] "little bridle", the diminutive of <b>frēnum)</b> {{is a small}} fold of tissue that secures or restricts the motion of a mobile organ in the body.|$|E
50|$|Foreskin {{piercing}} {{passes through}} the penile prepuce on the dorsal, ventral or lateral side. It can only be applied if the male is not circumcised. The <b>frenum</b> piercing {{passes through the}} penile <b>frenum,</b> a small skin bridge that connects the glans with the shaft skin. This anatomical part is also often missing in circumcised men. The hafada piercing is situated on {{the skin of the}} scrotum. As an intermediate version between frenulum and hafada, the lorum piercing (low <b>frenum)</b> sits at the point where penis and scrotum connect. The Jacob's Ladder is a ladder from <b>frenum</b> to scrotum. The guiche piercing is a body piercing on the perineum. These piercings play a lesser role in adding stimulation and more or less fulfill only a decorative purpose.|$|E

The third photo displays the wound after suturingof the incision which was completed.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frenum</b> piercings {{generally}} require {{from two}} to five weeks to heal fully. Depending on the placement {{it may be a}} surface piercing, but due to both the vascular, fast healing nature of the penis, and loose nature of the skin in that area, <b>frenum</b> piercings rarely reject if pierced properly, although they may migrate.|$|E
50|$|Both {{barbells}} {{and rings}} {{can be worn}} in <b>frenum</b> piercings, both as initial jewellery and on an ongoing basis. Sometimes, when rings are worn, {{the diameter of the}} ring is specifically chosen so that the ring can be worn encircling the penis. A wide variety of chastity devices make use of <b>frenum</b> piercings to secure themselves to the penis, as part of fetish or BDSM activities.|$|E
5000|$|A lorum is a male genital piercing, placed {{horizontally}} on {{the underside}} of the penis at its base, where the penis meets the scrotum. The word [...] "lorum" [...] is a portmanteau of the words [...] "low" [...] and [...] "frenum", so named because it is essentially a very low-placed <b>frenum</b> piercing.Much like the <b>frenum</b> piercing the lorum can have multiple rungs added and be a ladder as well.|$|E
5000|$|When space {{exists between}} the {{contacts}} of the maxillary central incisors, the condition {{is referred to as}} a diastema or [...] "gap tooth." [...] One frequent cause of the space is the presence of a large labial <b>frenum</b> from the upper lip extending near the teeth. Treatment depends upon the cause and extent of the gap. Periodontal surgery may be required to reduce the <b>frenum.</b> A small space may be corrected with a filling, veneer, or crown. Larger spaces may require orthodontics.|$|E
50|$|The {{tongue is}} {{attached}} {{to the floor of the}} mouth by a ligamentous band called the <b>frenum</b> and this gives it great mobility for the manipulation of food (and speech); the range of manipulation is optimally controlled by the action of several muscles and limited in its external range by the stretch of the <b>frenum.</b> The tongue's two sets of muscles, are four intrinsic muscles that originate in the tongue and are involved with its shaping, and four extrinsic muscles originating in bone that are involved with its movement.|$|E
5000|$|Ankyloglossia (tongue tie) - {{where the}} lingual <b>frenum</b> tethers the tongue {{to the floor}} of the mouth. If it interferes with oral hygiene and feeding, frenectomy may be indicated.|$|E
50|$|In {{contemporary}} society, <b>frenum</b> piercings {{were primarily}} found amongst {{the members of}} gay BDSM subcultures, until body piercing became re-introduced to mainstream society in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
50|$|The lingual <b>frenum</b> is also {{vulnerable}} to ulceration by repeated friction during oral sexual activity ("cunnilingus tongue"). Rarely, infants can ulcerate the tongue or lower lip with the teeth, termed Riga-Fede disease.|$|E
50|$|The lingual <b>frenum</b> (underside of the tongue) is {{vulnerable}} to ulceration by repeated friction during sexual activity ("cunnilingus tongue"). Ulceration of the lingual <b>frenum</b> caused by cunnilingus is horizontal, the lesion corresponding to the contact of the under surface of the tongue with {{the edges of the}} lower front teeth when the tongue is in its most forward position. This type of lesion resolves in 7-10 days, but may recur with repeated performances. Chronic ulceration at this site can cause linear fibrous hyperplasia. The incisal edges of the mandibular teeth can be smoothed to minimize the chance of trauma.|$|E
50|$|The {{tails of}} Hemigalinae species are ringed. The toes {{and the middle}} of {{the lower part of the}} tarsus are bald. The <b>frenum,</b> upper part, and sides of the lower part are hairy. The orbit is imperfect.|$|E
50|$|<b>Frenum</b> piercings {{are often}} {{intended}} to provide sexual pleasure to both the bearer and the person he is having sexual intercourse with. They may {{also be used to}} attach chastity devices to the bearer, denying them sexual pleasure.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes, a <b>frenum</b> ladder will be {{accompanied}} by a hafada ladder and/or a guiche ladder. Due to the relatively easy healing of these piercings {{it is not uncommon for}} several, or even all of them to be performed at the same time.|$|E
50|$|In general Aspidopleura {{does not}} closely {{resemble}} extant {{members of the}} subfamily Neanastatinae, with a very large speculum in the forewing and possessing a distinct <b>frenum.</b> These features are closer in appearance to females of the subfamily Eupelminae. However the sine patterning on the legs of Aspidopleura are much closer to that of extant Neanastatinae.|$|E
50|$|Mr. Phillips {{grew up in}} the quiet, crack-addled {{village of}} Chomping <b>Frenum,</b> on England's west coast. He went missing at age 10, after chasing a worm into the forest. He strayed into an army firing range and was hit by three {{medium-sized}} surface-to-air missiles. Fortunately they passed straight through his skull, though he did lose 80 percent of his brain matter.|$|E
50|$|A guiche {{piercing}} is a {{body piercing}} on the perineum. Guiche piercings are much more common in men than in women. Although a guiche normally runs perpendicular to {{the direction of the}} penis, lateral placements are possible. A series of guiche piercings in parallel to the direction of the penis is called a guiche ladder, and might commonly be seen as an extension of a <b>frenum</b> ladder.|$|E
50|$|The penis is {{sometimes}} pierced or decorated by other body art. Other than circumcision, genital alterations are almost universally elective and usually {{for the purpose}} of aesthetics or increased sensitivity. Piercings of the penis include the Prince Albert, the apadravya, the ampallang, the dydoe, and the <b>frenum</b> piercing. Foreskin restoration or stretching is a further form of body modification, as well as implants under the shaft of the penis.|$|E
50|$|The first {{dorsal fin}} is {{elongated}} and {{separated from the}} second dorsal fin. Both have a stiff first spine. The second dorsal fin and the anal fin are roughly the same size. The pectoral fins are rounded and shorter than {{the length of the}} head. The ventral fins are pointed and fused with a bridge of skin (a <b>frenum).</b> The caudal fin is rounded and are about the same length as the head.|$|E
50|$|The {{enlarged}} and bulbous-shaped end of {{the corpus}} spongiosum forms the glans penis, which supports the foreskin, or prepuce, a loose fold of skin that in adults can retract to expose the glans. The area {{on the underside of}} the penis, where the foreskin is attached, is called the <b>frenum,</b> or frenulum. The rounded base of the glans is called the corona. The perineal raphe is the noticeable line along the underside of the penis.|$|E
50|$|A hafada {{piercing}} is {{a surface}} piercing located {{anywhere on the}} skin of the scrotum. This piercing does not penetrate deep into the scrotum, and due to the looseness and flexibility of the skin in that area, does not migrate or reject as much as many other surface piercings. A piercing that passes through the scrotum, from front-to-back, or from side-to-side, is known as a transscrotal piercing. Multiple hafada piercings are not uncommon as an extension of a <b>frenum</b> ladder.|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} literary {{reference to}} <b>frenum</b> piercings occurs in Die künstlichen Verunstaltungen des Körpers bei den Batta. Zeitschrift für Ethnologie (16:217-225, 1884), which states: [...] "Amongst the Timorese of Indonesia, the Frenulum beneath the glans penis is pierced with brass rings...the {{function of the}} ring is to enhance stimulation during sex." [...] Anecdotal piercing lore associates this piercing (along with many other male genital piercings) with various chastity devices {{that have been used}} throughout history, although there is little hard data to back up this claim.|$|E
50|$|The sublingual glands are drained by 8-20 {{excretory}} ducts {{called the}} ducts of Rivinus. The largest of all, the sublingual duct (of Bartholin) joins the submandibular duct to drain through the sublingual caruncle. The sublingual caruncle {{is a small}} papilla near the midline of {{the floor of the}} mouth {{on each side of the}} lingual <b>frenum.</b> Most of the remaining small sublingual ducts open separately into the mouth on an elevated crest of mucous membrane, the plica sublingualis, formed by the gland and located on either side of the frenulum linguae.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two common}} procedures, one being {{very similar to}} a <b>frenum</b> {{piercing}} and the other being similar to inserting a subdermal implant, and requiring more medical knowledge and specialized tools. Either procedure is relatively safe with risks and healing much like a subdermal implant in {{any other part of}} the body, although, like many genital piercings, the generous blood flow to the genitals can reduce healing times considerably. Inflammation is very common, during and after healing, although careful healing can minimize this. Rejection is rare, but can occur.|$|E
5000|$|The gulf darter {{is known}} for its {{laterally}} compressed, robust body, small, conical head, slightly joined gill membranes and a wide <b>frenum</b> on its upper lip. The back has seven to nine diffuse, square saddles and a distinctive light pre-dorsal stripe. Horizontal light and dark banding is evident along the sides. Along their sides, breeding males have alternating red-orange and blue-green vertical bars that are most developed near the caudal fin. [...] On average, gulf darters are 5.3 cm long; they can grow up to 7.8 cm long.|$|E
50|$|Oplopomus are {{characterized}} by elongated bodies and compressed heads. They possess 24 to 30 ctenoid scales on the body, becoming cycloid on the nape before disappearing just behind the eyes. Their snouts are short and rounded, shorter than {{the diameter of the}} eyes. The lower jaw protrudes past the upper jaw, with a pair of canine teeth on each side. The dorsal fins are separate with six rays on the first. The ventral fins are joined by a bridge of skin (a <b>frenum).</b> The caudal fins are rounded. They can grow to a maximum length of 10 cm.|$|E
50|$|Those {{wishing to}} stretch this {{piercing}} to accommodate larger gauge jewelry should wait {{until at least}} two weeks after the initial piercing has fully healed. It is common for a <b>frenum</b> piercing to start to close soon after the jewelry has been removed. A fairly recent piercing may start to close in less than an hour. Temporary removal and replacement (for example, to accommodate a partner who finds it uncomfortable) may mean reinserting with a smaller gauge and then restretching {{to get back to the}} original, larger gauge. This tendency for the piercing to close up will diminish over time.|$|E
5000|$|The {{condition}} manifests as {{pain and}} soreness on the undersurface of the tongue, {{and sometimes the}} throat. The ulceration of the lingual <b>frenum</b> caused by cunnilingus is typically orientated horizontally, the lesion corresponding to the contact of the ventral tongue with the incisal edge of the mandibular incisor teeth when the tongue is in its most forward position and the lingual frenulum is stretched. The ulceration has a nonspecific appearance, and {{is covered with a}} fibrinous exudate and surrounded by an erythematous (red) [...] "halo". Chronic ulceration at this site can cause linear fibrous hyperplasia (irritation fibroma).|$|E
