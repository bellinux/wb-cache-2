500|$|Principal {{photography}} for The Rocketeer {{lasted from}} September 19, 1990 to January 22, 1991. Filming at the Griffith Observatory {{took place in}} November 1990. The film ended up going 50 days over schedule due to weather and mechanical problems. Rocketeer creator Dave Stevens allied himself with director Joe Johnston and production manager Ian Bryce {{in an effort to}} be as heavily involved in the production process as possible and to try and secure as much artistic control as he could from Disney. Disney, in particular, was not enthusiastic with Stevens' involvement. [...] "I was on the set day and night", Stevens reflected, [...] "from pre-production till post-production! And initially, I had to fight to prove that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of the film, and not for my own ego." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{music video}} {{for the song}} was shot and {{directed}} by Cliff Watts, who had also shot Beyoncé's Sports Illustrated cover. The video for the song served as the closing clip for the B'Day Anthology Video Album, and was filmed on Super 8 mm film in Miami. Beyoncé discussed the music video with MTV, stating that, [...] " [...] feels like something you shouldn't be seeing, like you found a home video. It's very raw: no retouching, no special effects. That's who I am. You can see my soul." [...] In an interview with Vibe Beyoncé recalled the video, [...] "I didn't have any hair and makeup. [...] just me {{on the beach and}} in the sun, and I brought one bathing suit 'cause <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> myself. It's very artistic and grimy, and [...] no retouching. It is what it is." ...|$|E
2500|$|David Bowie {{had this}} to say about his part of the film: [...] "They crammed me. I did all my scenes in four or five days, because I was in rehearsals for the 1991 Tin Machine tour. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> only a few days." ...|$|E

I dress so differently at such times, and talk so differently, and look so much older, that I almost fancy myself to be another person." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1933, Rumford {{passed the}} {{examination}} for employment with the State of California {{at a time}} when few blacks worked for the state. He also took the examination for investigator on the California Board of Pharmacy, passing the written portion twice, but failing the oral portion two times. [...] "I think I frightened everybody to death on the board when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> my oral examination. [...] I took the examination for food and drug investigator and I flunked the oral after they asked me about Joe Louis. And later I came back, took it again, and I flunked it again." [...] According to Rumford, the board was [...] "asking silly questions [...] to get rid of blacks." ...|$|E
2500|$|Following the draft, Quinn {{was criticized}} by fellow Notre Dame quarterback Joe Theismann {{in a radio}} interview, {{claiming}} that Quinn looked [...] "unprofessional" [...] {{when he was on}} stage following his name being called. Theismann was bothered by the appearance of Quinn's hair {{and the fact that he}} was chewing gum. Quinn responded, saying, [...] "I apologize to anyone, obviously, who is a Notre Dame alum, or for those fans who thought I wasn't being very business like. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> awhile, and at that moment in time, when you finally get picked after waiting for 4 1/2 hours, the last thought in my head was spit out your gum, fix your hair or make sure your shirt and everything looked good. I was just trying to get on stage as fast as possible and get that Browns jersey in my hand." ...|$|E

60|$|He took {{no notice}} {{whatever}} of me, although I, {{on my way}} to the lee of the chart-house, stood at his shoulder a full minute, offering him a chance to speak.

He also volunteered for three years to help blind and disabled children and guide teachers at the Mackay Centre School in Montreal. On art education, Ruberg said <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> guidance and assistance. Perhaps {{most important of all}} is encouragement. The young get discouraged easily. The finished art work is good incentive. Through early achievement comes patience and eventually maturity.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{took one}} look at that memento, and then I went to my room and packed my trunk. I threw a few things into my grip, gave my hair a flirt or two with a side-comb, put on my hat, and went in and gave the old lady's foot a kick. I'd tried awfully hard to use proper and correct {{language}} while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> Arthur's sake, and I had the habit down pat, but it left me then.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you will}} believe me, Magdalen, such a home as that Dearport Sisterhood is a {{precious}} thing--I {{have not been}} worthy of it. I have been a wild colt, carried about by all manner of passing excitements. Oh, dear! love of sheer fun and daring enterprise, and amusement, in shocking every one, even my very dearest, whom I loved best. I have done things too dreadful to think of, and been utterly unreasonable and unmanageable, and proud of it; but always that Sisterhood has been like a cord drawing me! I never quite got free of it, even when I sent back my medal, and fancied it had been playing at superstition. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a month as almost a baby, and the atmosphere has brought peace ever since. That, and my brother, and Sister Constance, and Bishop Fulmort, have been the saving of me, if anything has. I mean, if they will have me, to {{spend a little time}} at Dearport after all this perplexity is over, and I know how it is with Lena, and I could see how it is with Paula if you liked." ...|$|E
60|$|The water being calm, I {{had several}} times to descend as deep as a hundred feet before I was sure that I was out of their sight. After I had blown up the three ships at Boulogne I saw two {{aeroplanes}} flying down Channel, and I knew that they would head off any vessels which were coming up. There was one very large white steamer lying off Havre, but she steamed west before I could reach her. I dare say Stephan {{or one of the}} others would get her before long. But those infernal aeroplanes spoiled our sport for that day. Not another steamer did I see, save the never-ending torpedo-boats. I consoled myself with the reflection, however, that no food was passing me on its way to London. That was what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for,</b> after all. If I could do it without spending my torpedoes, all the better. Up to date I had fired ten of them and sunk nine steamers, so I had not wasted my weapons. That night I came back to the Kent coast and lay upon the bottom in shallow water near Dungeness.|$|E

5000|$|Before {{the movie}} was released, the actors {{announced}} that the characters of Ragetti and Pintel would play roles of some importance to the plot. In an interview with Empire magazine (Australia) Mackenzie Crook says [...] "You sort of discover that Lee (Arenberg) and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> more than just comic relief in the third movie. It turns out {{that we do have}} a purpose {{in the grand scheme of}} things". As seen in the trailer and in the movie itself, the two throw swords up through floorboards of Sao Feng's bathhouse to Elizabeth and Barbossa, allowing them to defend themselves when both Feng and the East India Trading Company attack.|$|R
60|$|I met him on {{a bright}} Sunday morning {{at the end of}} June in the park-like grounds of Walmer Castle. I had not long been seated on a garden bench when a daw came flying to a tree close by and began craning her neck and eyeing me with one eye, then the other, with an intense, almost painful curiosity; and these nervous {{movements}} and gestures immediately revealed to me that she had a nestful of young birds somewhere close by. After changing her position several times to view me from other points and find out what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for,</b> she {{came to the conclusion that}} I was not to be got rid of, and making a sudden dash to a tree standing just before me, disappeared in a small hole or cleft in the trunk about forty-five feet above the ground, and in a few seconds came out again and flew swiftly away. In four or five minutes she returned, and after eyeing me suspiciously a short time flew again to the tree and, vanishing from sight in the hole, remained there. I was intently watching that small black spot in the bark to see her emerge, when a little boy came slowly sauntering past my bench, and glancing at him I found that his shrewd brown eyes were watching my face and that he had a knowing half-smile on his lips.|$|E
6000|$|... "If you'd {{drop that}} play-acting talk and speak like a man, I'd like you better," [...] Sylvanus Power continued. [...] "There {{it is in}} plain words. I lived with my wife until we quarrelled and she left me, and while she lived with me I thought no more of women than cats. When she went, I thought I'd done with the sex. Elizabeth Dalstan {{happened}} along, and I found I hadn't even begun. Eight years ago we met. I offered her at once everything I could offer. Nothing doing. We don't need to tell one another that she isn't that sort. I went off and left her, spent a winter in Siberia, and came home by China. I suppose there were women there and in Paris. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> a month. I didn't see them. Then America. Elizabeth Dalstan was still touring, not doing much good for herself. I hung around for a time, tried my luck once more--no go. Then I went back to Europe, offered my wife ten million and an income for a divorce. It didn't suit her, so I came back again. The third time I found Elizabeth discouraged. If ever a man found {{a woman at the}} right time, I did. She is ambitious--Lord knows why! I hate acting and the theatres {{and everything to do with}} them. However, I tried a new move. I built that theatre in New York--there isn't another place like it in the world--and offered it to her for a birthday present. Then she began to hesitate." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “I don’t know {{anything}} {{more about that}} part of the business, for I got a crack on the head with a club, and did not {{know anything}} more till I was hauled on shore and chucked down. Then I saw them bring from the canoes the heads of all the others. It was frightful. Then they dragged the bodies out {{from the bottom of the}} canoes. They had all been stripped, and I believe I should have fainted if a big Malay had not given me a tremendous kick, and made me walk up to the village. As soon as I got there they tied me up and staked me out. There was a tremendous noise and shouting and yelling, but what was done I don’t know, as I could see nothing but the sky and the wall of the hut. It was an awful time; first because I knew that sooner or later they would kill me, and in the next place, because I was driven pretty nearly mad by the flies and things that settled on my face. Of course I could not brush them away, and all that I could do was to shake my head, and they did not seem to mind that. It seems ridiculous that, after seeing one’s friends killed and knowing that one is going to be killed oneself, one should worry over flies, but I can tell you I went nearly out of my mind with irritation at the tickling of their feet. It seemed to me that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>there</b> <b>for</b> ages, though I knew by the height of the sun that it was only about noon. The thirst, too, was fearful, and I made up my mind that the sooner they came and killed me the better. I found myself talking all sorts of nonsense, and I do think that I should have gone out of my mind before the day was over. When first I heard your voice I thought it must be a dream, like some of the other ideas that came into my mind. I had thought of you both when I was first fastened up, and wondered whether the Malays would find you. I had even thought at first that if you only knew where I was you might try to get me away after dark if I was not killed before that, and you can guess my feelings when I became convinced that it was really you. How did you know what had happened?” ...|$|E
