40|$|Where {{graphical}} <b>figures</b> <b>in</b> {{architectural drawing}} are read for their symbolic allusions, those figures might seem less instrumental to an architectural design and rather more an aesthetic choice.

This paper brings attention {{to the nature of}} graphical <b>figures</b> <b>in</b> architectural drawing; particularly their hybrid symbolic and indexical forms. It moves beyond a symbolic reading of figure to show how graphical <b>figures</b> <b>in</b> architectural drawing can sustain various kinds of reading.
