5|$|The {{origins of}} the breed are not fully documented, but some {{evidence}} points to the ancestors of the <b>Jutland</b> {{being used by the}} Vikings during the early 9th century. Images from the time show Viking raiders in what is now Great Britain riding horses similar in appearance to the modern <b>Jutland.</b> Some of those horses may have been left behind, contributing to the base stock from which the Suffolk Punch was eventually developed. Horses from <b>Jutland</b> were exported to England, Germany and France during the Middle Ages, and were popular mounts for knights, especially for use in jousting. The first mention of the <b>Jutland</b> type is from the 12th century, when they are documented as war horses with many useful attributes. The <b>Jutland</b> horse appears in the Danish ballad Svend Felding's Kamp med Risen, in which mythic hero Svend Fælling goes on a pilgrimage to Rome and on his journey encounters a giant. Other horses prove too shy or too weak to enable him to confront the giant, therefore Svend obtains a <b>Jutland</b> horse from a passing miller, who claims that it is strong enough to carry fifteen skippund. Mounted on the <b>Jutland,</b> Svend succeeds in killing the giant.|$|E
