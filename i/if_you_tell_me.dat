60|$|WISE MAN. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that you}} believe I shall be glad and not angry.|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Chudleigh looked surprised, {{but that}} was all. [...] "It may save us both trouble <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> candidly what you mean to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Of course, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that you}} are going on a journey, I will have your clothes got ready for you. When do you start?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mr. Fenwick, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> to go to--to--to,"--he {{was going}} to mention some very bad place, but was {{restrained}} by the parson's presence,--"if <b>you</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> to go anywheres, I'll go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't never {{contradict}} you; nor I don't mean, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tells</b> <b>me</b> so {{as often}} again. And I don't {{mean to be}} that impident as to tell my master as I ain't the only fool about the place. It wouldn't be no wise becoming." ...|$|R
5000|$|Millor que no m’ho expliquis (Better <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don’t <b>tell</b> <b>me)</b> (2003) ...|$|R
60|$|I don't {{wish to do}} that. Only you {{can tell}} me nothing that I don't know. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> you may do {{irreparable}} harm.|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course, sir, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{that you}} are not {{inclined}} to pay anything beyond the allowance you make me, there is an end of it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No;--I'm not a cousin. It's {{more like}} a foster-brother, you know. Of course I shan't call you Mary <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> not. How is it to be?" ...|$|E
60|$|NORA. Yes: it's {{hard for}} me to know {{anything}} about <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> never <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> anything.|$|R
6000|$|... "I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I {{should be}} much obliged <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> exactly the {{circumstances}} under which this document disappeared." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon, signorini," [...] he said, breathlessly, [...] "but {{it will be}} {{to oblige}} <b>me</b> greatly <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where Signor Ferralti is." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know as well}} as any man what chances {{you should}} run, and when to hold your hand. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> about mistakes, I shall make it personal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here, then, is your money: but remember, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing worth knowing, I have a {{force that}} can easily deprive you of it again, and punish your {{insolence}} in the bargain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm {{very much}} obliged to you; indeed I am. And I shall not care <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> of {{anything}} that's {{out of the}} way in my talking," [...] said Clementina, generously.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he said, [...] "I'd be glad <b>if</b> <b>you</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{exactly why}} <b>you</b> {{followed}} me. The reason you gave didn't seem sufficient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Is he?' said Baroni carelessly; 'I {{have known}} {{a good many}} Shehaabs, and <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> their company, I will <b>tell</b> <b>you</b> their creed.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn’t mean {{them to be}} remarks, Bill," [...] {{said the}} other, mildly. [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> about <b>me,</b> <b>you</b> know, Selina’ll see through your little game." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You have {{something}} on your mind," [...] he said, simply and quietly, taking {{the young man}} by the hand. [...] "I {{may be able to}} relieve you, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{will bring}} it back <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what to do!' cried the little fish, who would have promised {{anything}} that was likely to carry her up to earth again. And the queen answered: ...|$|E
60|$|But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> he did {{not feel}} my silence. However, he must have done so; and my guilt is {{irreparable}} now. I thank God at least heartily that {{he did not}} resent it.|$|E
6000|$|... "What now! Wouldst even belittle the act {{which we}} all witnessed? The King, my husband, shall reward <b>thee,</b> Sir Knight, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> but <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> your name." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Has that Copperfield no tongue?' muttered Uriah, 'I {{would do}} {{a good deal for}} <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> could <b>tell</b> <b>me,</b> without lying, that {{somebody}} had cut it out.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, I mean them sketches," [...] said Sir Bingo. [...] "I'll {{give you}} a {{handsome}} order for them, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>me.</b> I will, on my honour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I don't {{mean to be}} wilful!' said she, piteously; 'I won't go <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> not, {{but please}} don't. I have no Sunday-book, and nothing to do, and I should feel wrong all the week.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, I am I know,' said Tom; 'but you'll make {{me nervous}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so. I'm afraid you have put me {{out a little}} now, for I forget what I was going to say.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is very extraordinary!--Perhaps it will {{be better}} Michael, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> nothing but what is {{strictly}} the major's. A message should be delivered as nearly like the words that were actually sent as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “It was ore. Now, sir, I ask <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> {{who this}} Mr. Oliver Edwards is, {{that has made}} {{a part of your}} {{household}} since Christmas?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have taken}} the liberty of coming, sir," [...] the man announced, [...] "to ask <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> where I can find Mr. Arthur Morrison." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't be so cocky," [...] cried Pym, {{in sudden}} rebellion. [...] "You are only my {{amanuensis}} <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what that is. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> can't--out you go!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{may make}} your choice," [...] Glinda said to old Mombi, [...] "between death if you remain silent, {{and the loss}} of your magical powers <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the truth. But I think you will prefer to live.|$|E
6000|$|... "I know that," [...] {{retorted}} Gashford, with a scowl {{and something}} of a sneer, [...] "but it ain't impossible for you to guess. However, it will do as well <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> which party you intend to join." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh!" [...] said Mrs. Postwhistle. [...] "Well, I shouldn't 'ave felt instinctively {{it must be}} you, not if I'd 'ad to {{pick you}} out of a crowd. But <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> so, why, I suppose you are. Come in." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hiding, are you? Brute! Come out, or I'll--by heavens, I'll shoot <b>you</b> <b>if</b> <b>you</b> don't <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> the truth. I {{heard her}} voice in the lane. I'll swear to it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wonderful!" [...] I {{heard him}} say. [...] "I {{believe you have}} eyes in the ends of your fingers. Take this, now--and try <b>if</b> <b>you</b> can <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what it is." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. Pray, therefore, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> please, <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> what it is, as to this, {{that you}} know; and then, perhaps, I may also say {{something}} to you of the same.|$|R
