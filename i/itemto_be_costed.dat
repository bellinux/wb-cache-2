Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> also the sum of marginal costs over all units produced. They can also <b>be</b> considered normal <b>costs.</b> Fixed costs and variable costs make up the two components of total cost. Direct <b>costs,</b> however, <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> that can easily be associated with a particular cost object. However, not all variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> direct <b>costs.</b> For example, variable manufacturing overhead <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> variable <b>costs</b> that <b>are</b> indirect <b>costs,</b> not direct <b>costs.</b> Variable <b>costs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes called unit-level costs as they vary with the number of units produced.|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma thesis was to {{find out}} the total costs of {{planting}} of 1 hectare of wineyard. In the diploma thesis are concentrated figures for assessment of individual cost items in technical methods of wineyard planting. The total costs for wineyard planting were defined on the basis of particular found cost items. In the result part of the diploma thesis there were simulated 2 different options for wineyard planting which were different in number of plant and way of planting. For model A with distance of 2, 2 x 0, 8 m and number of plants 5200 pieces <b>were</b> assessed total <b>cost</b> for planting of 1 hectare of wineyard in the amount of 613232 CZK [...] 5, 4 % <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> for service of machines, 4, 3 % <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> for manual work and 90, 3 % <b>are</b> <b>costs</b> for material.
