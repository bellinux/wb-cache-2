I never kept any reckoning: but I know that one year with another? — and less of late years than in earlier time? — I have talked to more than five in each year, giving {{more than a hundred}} and fifty specimens. Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
500|$|Cibber replied {{mostly with}} good humour to Pope's aspersions ("some {{of which are}} in conspicuously bad taste", as Lowe points out), until 1742 when he responded in kind in [...] "A Letter from Mr. Cibber, to Mr. Pope, inquiring into the motives that might induce him in his Satyrical Works, to be so {{frequently}} fond of Mr. Cibber's name". In this pamphlet, Cibber's most effective ammunition came from a reference in Pope's Epistle to Arbuthnot (1735) to Cibber's [...] "whore", which gave Cibber a pretext for retorting in kind with a scandalous anecdote about Pope in a brothel. [...] "I must own", wrote Cibber, [...] "that I believe <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> of your whoring than you do of mine; because I don't recollect that ever I made you the least Confidence of my Amours, though I have been very near an Eye-Witness of Yours." [...] Since Pope was around four and a half feet tall and hunchbacked due to a tubercular infection of the spine he contracted when young, Cibber regarded the prospect of Pope with a woman as something humorous, and he speaks mockingly of the [...] "little-tiny manhood" [...] of Pope. For once the laughers were on Cibber's side, and the story [...] "raised a universal shout of merriment at Pope's expense". Pope made no direct reply, but took {{one of the most famous}} revenges in literary history. In the revised Dunciad that appeared in 1743, he changed his hero, the King of Dunces, from Lewis Theobald to Colley Cibber.|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Smells Like Teen Spirit" [...] were often {{difficult}} for listeners to decipher, both {{due to their}} nonsensicality and because of Cobain's slurred, guttural singing voice. This problem was {{compounded by the fact}} that the Nevermind album liner notes did not include any lyrics for the songs aside from selected lyrical fragments. This incomprehensibility contributed to the early resistance from radio stations towards adding the song to their playlists; one Geffen promoter recalled that people from rock radio told her, [...] "We can't play this. I can't understand what the guy is saying." [...] MTV went as far as to prepare a version of the video that included the lyrics running across the bottom of the screen, which they aired when the video was added to their heavy rotation schedule. The lyrics for the album—and some from earlier or alternate versions of the songs—were later released with the liner notes of the [...] "Lithium" [...] single in 1992. American rock critic Dave Marsh noted comments by disc jockeys of the time that the song was [...] "the 'Louie Louie' of the nineties" [...] and wrote, [...] "Like 'Louie,' only more so, 'Teen Spirit' reveals its secrets reluctantly and then often incoherently." [...] Marsh, trying to decipher the lyrics of the song, felt after reading the correct lyrics from the song's sheet music that [...] "what I imagined was quite a bit better (at least, more gratifying) than what Nirvana actually sang," [...] and added, [...] "Worst of all, I'm not sure that <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about [...] 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' now than before I plunked down for the official version of the facts." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Very much. I am hopeless of ever {{painting}} it though--it is {{so full of}} big, significant shadows. <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> about it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{you would}} not write to me, Constance, nor even to your mother! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that, because <b>I</b> wrote to her to ask for your address, and she replied {{that she did not}} <b>know</b> it, that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> about your {{movements}} in London than she did." ...|$|R
2500|$|The ADE 651 {{has been}} used at {{hundreds}} of Iraqi police and Iraqi military checkpoints across the country, often replacing physical inspections of vehicles. Major-General Jihad (also transliterated [...] "Jehad") al-Jabiri of the Interior Ministry's General Directorate for Combating Explosives has defended the device: [...] "Whether it's magic or scientific, what I care about is detecting bombs. I don't care what they say. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about bombs than the Americans do. In fact, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about bombs {{than anyone in the}} world." [...] He told a press conference that the ADE 651 has detected [...] "hundreds of roadside bombs and car bombs" [...] and any deficiencies were due to defective training in the device's use. The Iraqi Interior Minister, Jawad al-Bulani, also defended the device, telling Al Iraqiya television that the ADE 651 had [...] "managed to prevent and detect more than 16,000 bombs that would be a threat to people's life and more than 733 car bombs were defused." [...] He said: [...] "Iraq is considered as a market area for many companies producing such devices ... and there are other rival companies trying to belittle the efficiency of these instruments the government is buying".|$|E

60|$|Cel. She {{will accept}} on't, and she shall accept on't: I think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than you of her mind, sir.|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Belton; [...] "a Mr. Berdmore. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> of {{him than}} of her, though for {{the matter of}} that, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> very little of him either. She was a fast-going girl, {{and his friends were}} very sorry. But I think they are both dead or divorced, or that they have come to grief in some way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not unless <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about it, Ruby. I won't {{have you}} go and throw {{yourself}} into the gutter;--not while you're with me.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> {{than half}} a dozen of 'em," [...] {{retorted}} Robin, somewhat sharply, [...] "in what unrefined people call the haristocracy of London." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I do, Mademoiselle, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more.</b> I {{know that}} this hinted {{conspiracy}} against your father is a trumped-up lie to lure you to the coppice." ...|$|E
60|$|Two {{months have}} passed since that period; and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> no <b>more</b> about him now than <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> then.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hang me, if that's what you're hankerin' for!" [...] Corporal 'Lige {{cried in}} a voice that sounded thick and choked as if a heavy {{pressure}} was upon his throat. [...] "Even though <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> concernin' this 'ere expedition than I do, not a word should I speak." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Maybe. I don't say. If <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> {{about the}} world, perhaps I should admire it. But now, you see,"--and here Kitty's laugh grew more natural, {{and she gave}} a subtle {{caricature}} of Mr. Arbuton's air and tone as she spoke,--"I can't help feeling that it's a little--vulgar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There's a cross {{opposite}} her name," [...] said she. [...] "I don't intend to shuffle Annie Boyle into the discard until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about her." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "MY DEAR CHARLES,--I {{have often}} been {{thinking}} {{of you and your}} whereabouts in Germany, and wishing <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> about you; and at last {{it occurred to me that}} you might perhaps have the same wish about me, and that therefore I should do well to write to you.|$|R
60|$|The whole Museum whirled round me violently, {{and before}} <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{anything}} <b>more</b> <b>I</b> fainted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Not to have unbosomed to me before, {{which would}} have saved you a week of time, although, as it happens, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> of your story than you chose to tell, and {{therefore}} the days have not been altogether wasted. Well, to be brief, this Dr. Legh is a ravenous rogue." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not care}} to {{contradict}} you," [...] said the Yellow Hen, with dignity, [...] "but I have an idea <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about chickens than human beings do." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then he said: 'Well, now, you've {{been out}} in the wood all the day and I've stayed quietly at home, and all the same <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than you do.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I won't {{say that}} until <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> about the man. If {{you say he}} is a good, honest man, why then I'll be bound to believe I am mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come here to-morrow; <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> <b>more</b> then than <b>I</b> <b>know</b> now--I {{shall be}} able to fix with {{certainty}} the day for the fulfillment of your engagement with Perrine." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What {{you say is}} true, Swinton. You've bin a bad lot {{ever since}} I've know'd ye. I won't go for to deny that.

60|$|Mr. Gracedieu being {{undoubtedly}} {{ignorant of}} the woman's marriage, {{it was not easy}} to say what the consequence might be, in his excitable state, if I informed him of it. He would, in all probability, conclude that <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more</b> of the woman than he did. I decided on keeping my own counsel, for the present at least.|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> {{than you}} think," [...] said Smith, looking keenly {{at the young}} man's boyish, earnest face. [...] "Suppose I tell you that some one else shares Bellingham's rooms." ...|$|E
6000|$|Valdez. [...] Urge him not--not now! [...] 130 [...] This we beheld. Nor he nor <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more,</b> [...] Than {{what the}} magic imagery revealed. [...] The assassin, who pressed {{foremost}} of the three---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Know!' croaked the old woman, {{coming back}} {{a step or}} two, 'I know more than you think <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>more</b> than he thinks, deary, as I'll tell you by and bye. I know all.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, of friends," [...] I {{answered}} rather hesitatingly: for <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> meant <b>more</b> than friends, {{but could}} not tell what other word to employ. He helped me.|$|R
60|$|And his {{conversation}} {{was by no}} means commonplace. To me, I own, there was some excitement in talking quietly across a dinner-table with a man whose venomous pen-stabs had sapped the vitality of at least one monarchy. That much was a matter of public knowledge. But <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>more.</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> of him--from my friend--as a certainty what the guardians of social order in Europe had at most only suspected, or dimly guessed at.|$|R
6000|$|Duke. Go any way,--every way; ask no questions: <b>I</b> <b>know</b> no <b>more,</b> {{but that}} she must,--must be had. [...] [Exit VALERIO.|$|R
