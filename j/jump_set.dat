60|$|<b>Jump</b> <b>set</b> out in 1914 {{to catch}} {{swordfish}} on light tackle, and incidentally tuna under one hundred pounds. He was ridiculed, scorned, scoffed at, made a butt of by this particular heavy tackle angler, and cordially hated for his ambitions. Most anglers and boatmen repudiated his claims and looked askance at him. Personally I believed Jump might catch some swordfish or tuna on light tackle, {{but only one}} out of many, and that one not the fighting kind. I was wrong. It was Lone Angler who first drew my attention to Jump's achievements and possibilities. President Coxe was alive to them also, and he has rebuilt and rejuvenated the Tuna Club on the splendid standard set by its founder, Dr. Charles Frederick Holder, and with infinite patience and tact and labor, and love of fine angling and good fellowship, he has put down that small but mighty clique who threatened the ruin of sport at fair Avalon. This has not been public news, but it ought to be and shall be public news.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{her small}} stature, Green was a two time All-American setter at USC. She perfected the <b>jump</b> <b>set,</b> {{allowing}} her to meet the ball higher in the vertical plane and create a higher tempo in the offense. In doing so {{she was able to}} consistently create opportunities advantageous for her hitters. In 1977, Green led the Trojans to a 38-0 record and an AIAW National Championships. Hers was the first college volleyball team to ever register a perfect season. Green led the Trojans to their second National Championship the following year in 1978.|$|E

Measurements show Baumgartner also broke two other world records. With a final altitude of 38969 m (23.3884 miles), Baumgartner broke the unofficial record for the highest manned balloon flight of 37640 m previously set by Nicholas Piantanida. He also broke the record for the highest altitude <b>jump,</b> <b>set</b> in 1960 by retired USAF Colonel Joseph Kittinger, who was Baumgartner's mentor and capsule communicator at mission control. These claims were verified by the Fédération Aéronautique Internationale (FAI).|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} {{approximation of}} solutions of parametric or stochastic hyperbolic PDEs {{is still a}} serious challenge. Because of shock singularities, most methods from the elliptic and parabolic regime, such as reduced basis methods, POD or polynomial chaos expansions, show a poor performance. Recently, Welper [Interpolation of functions with parameter dependent jumps by transformed snapshots. SIAM Journal on Scientific Computing, 39 (4) :A 1225 -A 1250, 2017] introduced a new approximation method, based on the alignment of the <b>jump</b> <b>sets</b> of the snapshots. If {{the structure of the}} <b>jump</b> <b>sets</b> changes with parameter, this assumption is too restrictive. However, these changes are typically local in parameter space, so that in this paper, we explore $h$ and $hp$-adaptive methods to resolve them. Since local refinements do not scale to high dimensions, we introduce an alternative "tensorized" adaption method...|$|R

His gold winning performance in the long <b>jump</b> <b>set</b> a new Championship record in the F36 category, just 4 cm behind Roman Pavlyk's world record. Sviridov represented Russia at the 2012 Summer Paralympics in London where he competed in the F36 long jump, his favoured F36 shot put was not a featured event of the games.

A small stabilizer chute deployed successfully, and Kittinger fell for 4 minutes and 36 seconds, also setting a still-standing world record for the longest parachute free-fall, if falling with a stabilizer chute is counted as free-fall. At an altitude of 17500 ft, Kittinger opened his main chute and landed safely in the New Mexico desert. The whole descent took 13 minutes and 45 seconds.

50|$|As with passing, one may {{distinguish}} between an overhand and a bump set. Since the former allows for {{more control over}} the speed and direction of the ball, the bump is used only when the ball is so low it cannot be properly handled with fingertips, or in beach volleyball where rules regulating overhand setting are more stringent. In the case of a set, one also speaks of a front or back set, meaning whether the ball is passed in the direction the setter is facing or behind the setter. There is also a <b>jump</b> <b>set</b> that is used when the ball is too close to the net. In this case the setter usually jumps off his or her right foot straight up to avoid going into the net. The setter usually stands about ⅔ of the way from the left {{to the right of the}} net and faces the left (the larger portion of net that he or she can see).|$|E
