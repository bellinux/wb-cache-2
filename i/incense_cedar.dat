5|$|The mixed {{woodland}} region is a dense forest with {{many species of}} trees, located near {{the tops of the}} plateaus. The forest canopy shades the ground, resulting in a cooler temperature. The canopy also reduces the amount of water evaporation. California black oak, Douglas fir, Pacific madrone, <b>incense</b> <b>cedar,</b> and other plants grow in the {{mixed woodland}}. Shrubs such as Oregon grape, honeysuckle, blue elderberry, and Pacific poison oak also grow here. The soil in this area is mostly loam.|$|E
5|$|Along much of Yosemite's western boundary, {{habitats}} {{are dominated}} by mixed coniferous forests of ponderosa pine, sugar pine, <b>incense</b> <b>cedar,</b> white fir, Douglas fir, and a few stands of giant sequoia, interspersed by areas of black oak and canyon live oak. A relatively high diversity of wildlife species is supported by these habitats, because of relatively mild, lower-elevation climate and the mixture of habitat types and plant species. Wildlife species typically found in these habitats include black bear, coyote, raccoon, mountain kingsnake, Gilbert's skink, white-headed woodpecker, bobcat, river otter, gray fox, red fox, brown creeper, two species of skunk, cougar, spotted owl, and {{a wide variety of}} bat species.|$|E

5|$|A {{grove of}} {{enormous}} <b>incense</b> <b>cedars</b> exists near Diamond Lake, {{and there is}} a forest of ponderosa pine at the nearby Emile Big Tree Trail. The Umpqua National Forest features swordferns and Douglas firs. Rocky Mountain elks, pronghorns, and mule deer, bobcats, black bears, and mountain lions live in the Fremont–Winema National Forest. The forest's rivers support populations of trout, and the lakes contain fish such as the largemouth bass. The forest is inhabited by avian species such as mallards, American bald eagles, Canada geese, and whistling swans. Peregrine falcons and Warner suckers also infrequently enter its boundaries.|$|R
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California <b>incense</b> <b>cedar,</b> and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including gorse, Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E
5|$|Roxy Ann Peak's high {{biodiversity}} {{is due to}} {{its wide}} range of elevations and its location between the Cascade, Klamath, and Eastern Cascade ecoregions. The lower slopes of the peak support chaparral, oak savanna, and open grassland. Scattered California black oak, Oregon white oak, and Pacific madrone trees grow in these areas, as do sclerophyllous shrubs such as birchleaf mountain mahogany, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, buckbrush, antelope bitterbrush, and Pacific poison oak. Common grasses include blue wildrye and prairie Junegrass. Wildflowers including Southern Oregon buttercup, common yarrow, and Tolmie star-tulip also grow in these regions. At higher elevations, the vegetation transitions to mixed coniferous forest, dominated by Douglas fir, ponderosa pine, <b>incense</b> <b>cedar,</b> western juniper, and Pacific madrone trees. Shrubs such as common snowberry, bearbrush, greenleaf manzanita, sticky whiteleaf manzanita, deerbrush, and Pacific poison oak make up the understory of the forest, along with herbaceous plants such as creeping snowberry and Idaho fescue.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, <b>incense</b> <b>cedar,</b> and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical Environmental Concern (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E

40|$|The Heterobusidion taxonomic complex {{comprises}} two of {{the most}} important hngal tree pathogens in North America (Okosina 1989), and includes at least three other taxa in Eurasia (Niemela 1998). These taxa were initially identified as intersterility groups (ISGs) (Korhonen 1978) within the species H. annosum, but the current trend is to assign them the species rank based on molecular, morphological, and host-association haits. European 1 SGs have already been accepted as different species (Niemela 1998). Although yet to he defined as species by taxonomists, the North American Ileterobusidion ISGs have a much wider genetic divergence and isolation than their European counterparts (Otrosina 1993), and are also ecologically specialized on different hosts (Otrosina 1989; Worrall 1983). In this paper we will use the terms "species " and "ISGs " interchangeably when referring to the two North American taxa of Heterobasidion. In California, host specificity effectively strengthens the genetic isolation between the two sympatric Heterobasidion ISGs. Isolates of the "S " ISG infect mostly true firs, hemlocks, and sequoias; the "P " ISG infects mostly pines, junipers, and <b>incense</b> <b>cedars</b> (Otrosina 1989). Nevertheless, there is significant interfertility among S and P isolates in lahoratory mating tests (Hamngton 1989), where host-specific discrimination is artificially removed.

25|$|During construction, 2,000 fossils were discovered, {{including}} 64 {{extinct species}} of fish, the tusk of an Ice Age elephant and {{the bones of}} an ancient longhorn bison, a report funded by the MTA found. The report was authored by paleontologist Bruce Lander of Paleo Environmental Associates in Irvine. Lander worked {{with a team of}} 28 scientists during construction of the Metro Rail Red Line. Fossil evidence showed that {{tens of thousands of years}} ago, ground sloths, horses, elephants and camels roamed among redwood trees in what is now Los Angeles, according to an MTA summary of the 300-page report. The scientists also found evidence of a great flood in the San Fernando Valley 9,000 years ago that swept away trees. Among the 64 extinct species of marine fish 39 had never before been discovered, the report said. The scientists found bones of an American mastodon, a western camel and a Harlan's ground sloth. They found wood and pollen of land plants including <b>incense</b> <b>cedar</b> and coast redwood trees, and bones of birds, shrews, cottontail rabbits, gophers, mice and kangaroo rats. Some of the fossils are as much as 16.5 million years old.|$|E
500|$|Most of the Rogue River {{watershed}} {{is in the}} Klamath Mountains ecoregion {{designated by}} the EPA, although part of the upper basin is in the Cascades ecoregion, {{and part of the}} lower basin is in the Coast Range ecoregion.

On top of the pagoda, a white stone is placed together with ox and sheep horns. By tradition, the door of a Qiang house is supposed to face south and the pagoda is built on the northern end of the roof in line with the door. Every morning, the Qiang family will burn <b>incense</b> sticks or <b>cedar</b> twigs in the pagoda and kneel to it, praying {{for the protection of the}} family by the god of the white stone.|$|R
500|$|At and in {{the area}} below the lake, mixed forests of ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa), red fir (Abies Magnifica), white fir (Abies Concolor), {{lodgepole}} pine (Pinus Contorda), <b>incense</b> <b>cedar</b> (Libocedrus decurrens) and alder can be found. [...] Alders play a particularly important role, as alders establish symbioses with the nitrogen-fixing Actinobacteria (Frankiella alni). This bacteria converts atmospheric nitrogen into soil-soluble nitrates which can be utilised by the alder, and favorably enhances the soil fertility generally. Alders benefit other plants growing near them by taking nitrogen {{out of the air}} and depositing it in the soil in usable form; fallen alder leaves make very rich compost. Picea breweriana exists in a few small locations on the igneous slopes behind the lake. Other deciduous trees at lower elevations in the area may include such species as bigleaf maple, vine maple, black oak and Pacific dogwood.|$|E
500|$|Further {{downstream}} {{a diverse}} mix of conifers, broadleaf evergreens, and deciduous {{trees and shrubs}} grow {{in parts of the}} basin. In more populated areas, orchards, cropland, and pastureland have largely replaced the original vegetation, although remnants of oak savanna, prairie vegetation, and seasonal ponds survive at Table Rocks north of Medford. Oak woodlands, grassland savanna, ponderosa pine, and Douglas-fir thrive in the relatively dry foothills east of Medford; areas {{in the foothills of the}} Illinois Valley support Douglas-fir, madrone, and <b>incense</b> <b>cedar.</b> Parts of the Illinois River watershed have sparse vegetation including Jeffrey pine and oak and ceanothus species that grow in serpentine soils. The Klamath-Siskiyou region of northern California and southwestern Oregon, including parts of the southwestern Rogue basin, is among the four most diverse temperate coniferous forests in the world. Considered one of the global centers of biodiversity, it contains about 3,500 different plant species. The Klamath-Siskiyou region is one of seven International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) areas of global botanical significance in North America and has been proposed as a World Heritage Site and UNESCO Biosphere Reserve.|$|E
