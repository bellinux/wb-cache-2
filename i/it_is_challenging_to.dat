25|$|Due {{to limited}} disclosure, {{studying}} the returns to private equity is relatively difficult. Unlike mutual funds, {{private equity funds}} need not disclose performance data. And, as they invest in private companies, {{it is difficult to}} examine the underlying investments. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> compare private equity performance to public equity performance, in particular because private equity fund investments are drawn and returned over time as investments are made and subsequently realized.|$|E
25|$|Euglossine {{bees are}} a {{relatively}} new group of bee, sharing a common ancestor with the Bombini, {{one of the four}} tribes of corbiculate bee that have a pollen basket. The genus Eufriesia is the second largest within the Euglossini tribe. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> distinguish between the over fifty Eufriesea species, particularly since the females mimic each other. Within the surinamensis group {{it is very difficult to}} distinguish between females of different species.|$|E

25|$|When a {{programming}} language evolves a more elaborate type system, it gains a more finely grained rule set than basic type checking, but this {{comes at a price}} when the type inferences (and other properties) become undecidable, and when more attention must be paid by the programmer to annotate code or to consider computer-related operations and functioning. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> find a sufficiently expressive type system that satisfies all programming practices in a type safe manner.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> {{identify}} rare variants accurately using standard NGS methods {{with the}} mutations rate of (10−2 - 10−3). Errors that happen early during sample preparation {{can be detected}} as rare variants. An example of such errors is C>A/G>T transversion that is detected in low frequencies using deep sequencing or targeted capture data and arise {{as the result of}} DNA oxidation during sample preparation. These types of false positive variants are filter out by duplex sequencing method since mutations need to be accurately matched in both strands of DNA to be validated as true mutations. Duplex sequencing can theoretically detect mutations with frequencies as low as 10−8 compare to 10−2 rate of standard NGS methods.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> {{determine}} {{the length of}} the egg phase because eggs are sometimes eaten as part of a dominance struggle. However, since the first eggs, which produce the first workers, are much less likely to get eaten, one can obtain a general sense of the timing. Most of these first eggs hatch within 10–13 days of being laid. Once the eggs hatch, the larval stage begins. The duration of this phase varies significantly, mostly based {{on the development of the}} colony. As the development of the colony varies, so do the feeding practices, and rate of feeding effects the duration of the larval stage. The length of the larval stages peaks at 60 days, but the average larvae remained in the larval phase for 15–30 days.|$|E

2500|$|Tissue {{residue of}} metals in {{invertebrate}} prey organisms may reduce uncertainty in estimating exposure from multiple routes. This {{may be especially}} important in early life stages of an organism or for species listed under the Endangered Species Act (ESA). However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> develop a suitable approach to assessing metal toxicity through tissue residue because water quality can have a large influence on metal toxicity. With the exception of organometallic compounds, no generalized approaches have been created for analyzing metals in tissue residue, although site-specific and species-specific approaches have been successfully developed and used, especially for invertebrates. A recent paper examined tissue-residue toxicity for copper and cadmium in fish and found low variability among species for both metals compared to aqueous-exposure toxicity metrics. [...] These results indicate that whole-body concentrations of metals in fish may be useful for Environmental Quality Guidelines, forensic evaluation, and ecological risk assessment. [...] An additional benefit includes the potential to characterize a contaminated ecosystem based on elevated whole-body metal concentrations resulting from acclimation.|$|E

30|$|Our case {{presented}} a thought-provoking hepatobiliary course. The patient was initially followed for a slow-growing hepatic hemangioma, but eventually diagnosed with IPNB. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>challenging</b> <b>to</b> distinguish the two conditions. Furthermore, {{although there are}} several reports of hemobilia originating from hepatic hemangioma, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> very rare in IPNB. Nonetheless, our experience in this case suggests that IPNB should be considered during differential diagnosis of dilated hepatobiliary tumors with hemobilia.|$|R

However, minor uplift can be roughly estimated from 2002 to 2006 (Fig.  10 b), suggesting the preparatory process may have initiated prior to 2006.|$|R

So in 1912, the Carnegie Technical Schools were renamed Carnegie Institute of Technology. Hamerschlag then led the development of bachelor's and master's degree programs, and the college took off.|$|R
