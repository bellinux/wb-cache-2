25|$|South Korea is a newer {{player in}} the Asian space race. In August 2006 South Korea {{launched}} its first military communications satellite, the Mugunghwa-5. The satellite was placed in geosynchronous orbit and collects surveillance information about North Korea. The South Korean government is spending {{hundreds of millions of}} dollars in space technology and was due to launch its first space launcher, the Korea Space Launch Vehicle, in 2008. South Korea's government justifies the cost for reasons of long-term commercial benefits and national pride. South Korea has long seen North Korea's significantly longer missile range as a serious threat to its national security. With the nation's first astronaut launched into space, Lee So-yeon, South Korea gained confidence in entering the Asian space race. They are completing the construction of Naro Space Center. Once it is operational, South Korea will be able to build satellites and missiles with local technology. South Korea <b>is</b> <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> space program that could defend the peninsula while lessening their dependency on the United States.|$|E

In February 2017, Chihuahua became the first state to reach five identical amparos in a row, and action has been taken to ensure that the State Congress legalizes same-sex marriage in its Civil Code.|$|E
2500|$|Achieving a [...] "Greater Bangladesh" [...] as Lebensraum (additional living space) {{is alleged}} to be the reason for {{large-scale}} illegal immigration from Bangladesh into India's states. Similarly it is alleged that illegal immigration is actively encouraged by some political groups in Bangladesh {{as well as the}} state of Bangladesh to convert large parts of India's northeastern states, particularly Assam and West Bengal into Muslim-majority areas that would subsequently seek to separate from India and join Muslim-majority Bangladesh. One Indian proposition is that the state of Bangladesh <b>is</b> <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> territorial design seeking a Lebensraum for its teeming population and trying to establish a Greater Bangladesh. Another proposition called for capturing one or two districts in Bangladesh and sending illegal immigrants there. Yet another proposition called for killing off Bangladeshi immigrants in India to thwart the designs of state of Bangladesh.|$|E

2500|$|Sporveien Trikken is in {{the process}} of buying new trams. Because of their poor {{technical}} state and high maintenance costs, the company may chose to replace all its SL95, despite their age. The tramway <b>is</b> <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> shelfware tram mode which has low investment costs and optimized for street running. If the trams are to be used concurrently with the metro, they need to have a reinforced cab to better withstand a head-on collision and automatic train protection. This will make procuring shelfware impossible, while providing worse sight-lines for the motorman and increased damage in case of collisions elsewhere. The increased unit cost per tram would be about 2 to 3.5 million kroner. In addition, the infrastructure at Bekkestua does not allow for trams with the international standard of [...] loading gauge. A 2013 report by Ruter therefore recommended that the tram services from Jar to Bekkestua only run until the SL95 trams are retired.|$|E
2500|$|Scholars have {{discussed}} whether idol worshipers made {{a distinction between}} a spiritual being that existed independently of idols and the physical idols themselves. Some scholars opine that the pagans in the Hebrew Bible did not literally worship the objects themselves, so {{that the issue of}} idolatry is really concerned with whether one <b>is</b> <b>pursuing</b> <b>a</b> [...] "false god" [...] or [...] "the true God". In addition to the spiritual aspect of their worship, peoples in the Ancient Near East took great care to physically maintain their cult idols and thought that the instructions for their manufacture and maintenance came from the spirit of the god. Magical ceremonies were performed through which the people believed the spirit of the god came to live in the physical idol. When idols were captured or not cared for, the associated religious practices also flagged. So while scholars may debate the relative importance of belief in the physical object or the spirit it represented or housed, in practice the distinction was not easy to discern.|$|E
