40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{city is a}} relatively recent concept which has gained increasing attention the last decades both through {{the international community and}} through <b>grass</b> <b>root</b> <b>movements.</b> This study aims to explore how the {{sustainable city}} can be translated from theory to practice, using the United Nations universal guide lines for sustainable human settlements as a theoretic background to a comparative case study of Curitiba, Brazil and Portland, USA. The <b>grass</b> <b>root</b> <b>movement</b> of the eco-city concept is also explored as it is a broader approach to sustainable urban planning then the UN HABITAT guide lines. The study focuses on the integration of land-use and transportation systems as a way to improve the efficiency of cities. A well planned and integrated land-use and transportation system can limit land-use development while reducing green house gas emissions. The study show that the key for improving urban planning is through long term political engagement. There is no city which has successfully implemented strategies for sustainable development. A common problem is the conflicting interest of growth that undermines the potential of integrating sufficient strategies. Often governments fail to address the dynamics of the concept of sustainability which must be viewed as a constant process. The city of Curitiba demonstrates that less developed nations can improve urban planning even with limited means...|$|R

40|$|Since 1976 a ”Green energy cluster ” {{consisting}} {{of renewable energy}} technologies such as wind power, solar energy and biomass technologies, and energy conservation technologies has developed in Denmark. The export of these technologies has increased from 540 mill. ECU in 1992 to around 5000 mill. ECU in 2002 and the employment have increased to around 25000 persons. This sector consequently {{is one of the}} main reasons why the Denmark had a balance of payment surplus of 4800 mill. ECU in 2002 and a relatively low unemployment rate. But which were the main reasons behind this development of a “Green Energy Cluster”? This is the main question to be dealt with in this paper. The main agents were the <b>grass</b> <b>root</b> <b>movements</b> within renewable energy, the Parliament, the medium scale production companies and the energy companies. In general the energy companies regarded the new “Green technologies ” as competitors to their large power plants based upon coal and oil, and tried to slow down and/or hinder the “green innovation ” process. The success was achieved by an active collaboration between some politicians recognising that an active energy policy was necessary and possible, private construction firms and an energy <b>grass</b> <b>root</b> <b>movement.</b> In this process a set of very concrete institutional reforms were established during the eighties and the nineties, furthering the “Green innovation “ development process. This paper deal with the innovative political process developing the institutional reforms as well as a description of a set of concrete institutional reforms furthering the innovative development...|$|R
5000|$|The idea of {{grassroots}} {{is often}} conflated with participatory democracy.

The terms can be distinguished in that grassroots often refers to a specific movement or organization, whereas participatory democracy refers to the larger system of governance.The Green Party of the United states is a major <b>Grass</b> <b>roots</b> <b>movement.</b> It is a political party, for the people, by the people.|$|E

50|$|The {{practice}} of cyberfeminist art is inextricably intertwined with cyberfeminist theory. The 100 anti-theses {{make clear that}} cyberfeminism {{is not just about}} theory, while theory is extremely important, cyberfeminism requires participation. As one member of the cyberfeminist collective the Old Boys Network writes, cyberfeminism is “linked to aesthetic and ironic strategies as intrinsic tools within the growing importance of design and aesthetics in the new world order of flowing pancapitalism”.

40|$|For centuries the West {{has seen}} the Muslim woman as an entire {{group of people in}} need of saving. Lacking a {{thorough}} understanding of Islam and an incredibly diverse Middle Eastern society, Western powers endeavored to shape women of the Middle East into secular, modern examples of 2 ̆ 2 liberated 2 ̆ 2 women. Completely unacknowledged in this pursuit are the <b>grass</b> <b>roots</b> <b>movements</b> that emerged out of nationalist movements in the early twentieth century. An attempt to understand why the West is so incredibly fascinated by Muslim is undertaken in this scholarly pursuit.
