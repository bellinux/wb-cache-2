40|$|Abstract Background The {{interaction}} of human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV- 1) Tax 1 protein with the tumor suppressor Dlg 1 is correlated with cellular transformation. Results Here, {{we show that}} Dlg 1 knockdown by RNA interference increases the ability of Tax 1 to transform a mouse T-cell line (CTLL- 2), as measured interleukin (IL) - 2 -independent growth. A Tax 1 mutant defective for the Dlg 1 interaction showed reduced transformation of CTLL- 2 compared to wild type Tax 1, but the transformation was minimally affected by Dlg 1 reduction. The few Tax 1 ΔC-transduced CTLL- 2 cells that became transformed <b>expressed</b> <b>less</b> Dlg 1 than parental cells, suggesting that Dlg 1 -low cells were selectively transformed by Tax 1 ΔC. Moreover, all human T-cell lines immortalized by HTLV- 1, including the recombinant HTLV- 1 -containing Tax 1 ΔC, <b>expressed</b> <b>less</b> Dlg 1 than control T-cell lines. Conclusion These results suggest that inactivation of Dlg 1 augments Tax 1 -mediated transformation of CTLL- 2, and PDZ protein(s) other than Dlg 1 are critically involved in the transformation. </p...|$|R

Many websites lampoon racism instead of racial minorities, however at present {{we do not know}} whether such websites increase or ameliorate racial animosity.

Furthermore, wild type mice engrafted with CXCR 6 −/ − bone marrow cells displayed fewer bone marrow-derived fibroblasts in the kidneys with obstructive injury and showed less severe renal fibrosis compared with wild-type mice engrafted with CXCR 6 +/+ bone marrow cells. Transplant of wild type bone marrow into CXCR 6 −/ − recipients restored recruitment of myeloid fibroblasts and susceptibility to fibrosis.

40|$|The minimum {{sequence}} of the enzymatic (A) subunit of Shiga toxin (STX) required for activity was investigated by introducing N-terminal and C-terminal deletions in the molecule. Enzymatic activity was assessed by using an in vitro translation system. A 253 -amino-acid STX A polypeptide, which is recognized as the enzymatically active portion of the 293 -amino-acid A subunit, <b>expressed</b> <b>less</b> than wild-type levels of activity. In addition, alteration of the proposed nicking site between Ala- 253 and Ser- 254 by site-directed mutagenesis apparently prevented proteolytic processing but {{had no effect on}} the enzymatic activity of the molecule. Therefore, deletion analysis was used to identify amino acid residue 271 as the C terminus of the enzymatically active portion of the STX A subunit. STX A polypeptides with N-terminal and C-terminal deletions were released into the periplasmic space of Escherichia coli by fusion to the signal peptide and the first 22 amino acids of Shiga-like toxin type II, a member of the STX family. Although these fusion proteins <b>expressed</b> <b>less</b> than wild-type levels of enzymatic activity, they confirmed the previous finding that Tyr- 77 is an active-site residue.

Recent evidence from other cell systems suggests that heat shock proteins (hsps) may participate in these processes. Therefore, we have examined expression of hsp {{and the effect of}} either increased or decreased expression of the hsp 90 in U 937 cells. Parental U 937 cells express high levels of hsp 90, hsp 73, and hsp 65, but little hsp 72. Heat shock at 42 degrees C for 30 min increased hsp 72 levels but caused no change in hsp 90. U 937 cells transfected with the expression vector pBA. 4 containing either an anti-sense or a sense hsp 90 cDNA insert showed constitutive decrease, or increase, in expression of hsp 90. Decreased hsp 90 levels slowed the rate of cell division and levels of hsp 90 correlated both with the responses to phorbol esters and with phenotypic changes: antisense-transfected cells <b>expressed</b> <b>less</b> CD 50. Sense-transfected cells showed no change in cell cycle, but <b>expressed</b> <b>less</b> CD 14 than controls.
