5|$|The {{rivalry between}} Rated-RKO (Edge and Randy Orton) and D-Generation X (DX; Triple H and Shawn Michaels) {{began on the}} October 9 edition of Raw. Edge and Orton both had {{problems}} with DX {{in the past and}} formed an alliance against them, and challenged DX to a match at Cyber Sunday, WWE's only pay-per-view where people can <b>go</b> <b>online</b> and votes for different aspects of a match. Rated-RKO defeated DX, after Eric Bischoff, the referee of the match, let Orton use a folding chair, which led Rated-RKO to victory. For consecutive weeks, Triple H and Orton competed in singles matches. On the December 11 edition of Raw, Flair assisted DX in an ambush by Rated-RKO and Kenny, and Coachman came out to announce a Six-man tag team match, where DX and Flair again emerged victorious. DX would challenge Rated-RKO for the World Tag Team Championships at New Year's Revolution.|$|E

The result was to extend the life of Hubble until JWST, as the next generation telescope, could <b>go</b> <b>online.</b> This led to a radically altered design for JWST to obtain images deeper into the infrared than Hubble, and beyond the capabilities of the Infrared Space Observatory and the Spitzer Space Telescope.|$|E

PGSMA said this information would <b>go</b> <b>online.</b> Pacific Steel & Recycling declined to renew its donation in 2009, but in March 2010 Farmers Union Insurance (a local insurance group) stepped forward to make a donation to keep the museum admission-free in 2010. Farmers Union renewed its donation in 2011. A $2,000 grant in October 2011, received from RBC Foundation-USA, was used to fund educational workshops for high school students. PGSMA said it would link these educational offerings to exhibits at the museum.|$|E
25|$|In the past, social {{networking}} services {{were viewed as}} a distraction and offered no educational benefit. Blocking these social networks {{was a form of}} protection for students against wasting time, bullying, and invasions of privacy. In an educational setting, Facebook, for example, is seen by many instructors and educators as a frivolous, time-wasting distraction from schoolwork, and {{it is not uncommon to}} be banned in junior high or high school computer labs. Cyberbullying has become an issue of concern with {{social networking}} services. According to the UK Children <b>Go</b> <b>Online</b> survey of 9- to 19-year-olds, it was found that a third have received bullying comments online. To avoid this problem, many school districts/boards have blocked access to social networking services such as Facebook, MySpace, and Twitter within the school environment. Social networking services often include a lot of personal information posted publicly, and many believe that sharing personal information is a window into privacy theft. Schools have taken action to protect students from this. It is believed that this outpouring of identifiable information and the easy communication vehicle that social networking services opens the door to sexual predators, cyberbullying, and cyberstalking. In contrast, however, 70% of social media using teens and 85% of adults believe that people are mostly kind to one another on social network sites.|$|E

[...] Of her surprise to the unexpected fandom, Faust said, [...] "From the messages I've received, these episodes have lifted spirits, brought parents and kids together, changed perspectives and inspired the most unlikely of people in the most unlikely of places.

Many of the creative staff are on various social media services and directly interact with the fandom, including doing questions-and-answer sessions live during the broadcast of new episodes. Daniel Ingram, who writes and composes of the , {{was pleased with the}} fan's reaction to the show's music but said, [...] "I never forget about the original demographic of our show, which is six-year-old girls.

The phrase also suggests the ability to [...] "computer cross-dress" [...] and represent oneself as a different gender, age, race, etc. On another level, [...] "the freedom which the dog chooses to avail itself of, is the freedom to 'pass' as part of a privileged group; i.e. human computer users with access to the Internet".|$|E

500|$|Mario Kart DS is {{the first}} Mario Kart {{iteration}} to support online play. Konno remarked that although both Mario Kart DS and the Halo series of games feature online play, he noted {{that most of the}} people who use the feature in Halo games were [...] "hardcore gamers". With Mario Kart DS, Konno wants [...] "everyone to <b>go</b> <b>online,</b> and the technology and time is right for that to happen". Continuing with the tradition of introducing a new gameplay mechanic in each Mario Kart game, Mario Kart DS {{is the first}} in the series to support up to eight players at the same time with game cartridges. New to the series, the game also includes a single-player Battle Mode, which does not require that there be at least two human participants. As the first Mario Kart game for the Nintendo DS, the developers tested several features that took advantage of the device's bottom touchscreen. They considered letting players place items anywhere on the track instead of just behind their kart. However, the developers found it too confusing because the game already had too many distractions, making it difficult to control where to place items while racing.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the fall}} of 2011, colleges were {{required}} by federal law to post a net price calculator on their websites to give prospective students and families a rough estimate of likely college costs for their particular institution, and to [...] "demystify pricing." [...] A student or family could <b>go</b> <b>online,</b> find the calculator at a college's website, and enter the required financial and academic information, and the calculator should tell them {{an estimate of the}} likely cost of attending that college. The first online calculators were started by Williams College. The online calculators look at financial need and academic merit to try to estimate the likely discounted price offered to a particular student from a particular college, using information including details from tax returns, household income, grade point averages and test scores. Schools vary in terms of their pricing formulas; some consider home equity as a factor while others disregard it. Lynn O'Shaughnessy recommends that families shopping for colleges go to a college's website and use the net price calculator to get a personalized estimate of cost.|$|E
