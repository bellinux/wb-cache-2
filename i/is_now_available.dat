5|$|Arthur (Or the Decline and Fall of the British Empire) is {{the seventh}} studio album by English rock band the Kinks, {{released}} in October 1969. Kinks frontman Ray Davies constructed the concept album as the soundtrack to a Granada Television play and developed the storyline with novelist Julian Mitchell; however, the television programme was cancelled and never produced.

A large variety of breads <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>available</b> from bakeries and cafes.|$|E

5|$|The Rosetta Stone was {{originally}} displayed at a slight angle from the horizontal, and rested within a metal cradle {{that was made}} for it, which involved shaving off very small portions of its sides {{to ensure that the}} cradle fitted securely. It originally had no protective covering, and it was found necessary by 1847 to place it in a protective frame, despite the presence of attendants to ensure that it was not touched by visitors. Since 2004, the conserved stone has been on display in a specially built case in the centre of the Egyptian Sculpture Gallery. A replica of the Rosetta Stone <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>available</b> in the King's Library of the British Museum, without a case and free to touch, as it would have appeared to early 19th-century visitors.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, actress Jane Seymour {{bought the}} house with her then husband David Flynn for £350,000. After {{spending}} £3 million on refurbishments, they undertook renovation of the house. They brought purchased furniture from Littlecote House, owned by Sir Seton Wills, as he was selling his house and there was little furniture at St Catherine's. Seymour spent summers at the house. After her divorce from Flynn and marriage to American film producer James Keach, Seymour rented out the manor as a film set, recording studio and latterly country house estate/hotel for corporate events and weddings. The English band The Cure recorded their album Wild Mood Swings there in end of 1994 and 1995; they came back {{in the autumn of}} 1998 to record most of their 2000 album Bloodflowers. The rock band Radiohead recorded most of their 1997 album OK Computer there. English Rock/Electronic Band New Order also recorded part of their 2005 album Waiting for the Sirens' Call at St Catherine's Court. The property was also rented by Robbie Williams, as seen in the first episode of MTV Cribs. In May 2007, Seymour was granted a 24-hour alcohol and entertainment licence under new UK regulations, by Bath and North East Somerset council. Neighbours complained the access lane was too narrow and the noise excessive. Seymour won the court battle, but sold the house in November 2007 to an unknown buyer. In 2009 a planning application for a two-storey extension, including a swimming pool was submitted to the local council. This was on the site of a previous orchard from which the trees were transplanted. The house <b>is</b> <b>now</b> <b>available</b> for catered rental and weddings.|$|E
