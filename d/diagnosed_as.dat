One study found that 17% of children with DKA were initially <b>diagnosed</b> <b>as</b> having gastroenteritis.|$|E

40|$|This {{study had}} been planned to see the histomorphological pattern of gastric mucosal biopsy, {{demonstrate}} the organism H. Pylori and correlate with endoscopic findings. The study {{was carried out in}} the department of the Pathology Rajshahi Medical College, Rajshahi, Bangladesh, during the period from January 2006 to December 2007.
