25|$|Henry Ford's ideological {{approach}} to Model T design {{was one of}} <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> and then keeping it the same; he believed the Model T was all the car a person would, or could, ever need. As other companies offered comfort and styling advantages, at competitive prices, the Model T lost market share. Design changes were not as few as the public perceived, {{but the idea of}} an unchanging model was kept intact. Eventually, on May 26, 1927, Ford Motor Company ceased US production and began the changeovers required to produce the Model A. Some of the other Model T factories in the world continued a short while.|$|E

Whereas in America, I don't know if I'm <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> or not." [...] Despite this, his script writing went [...] "remarkably fast. I suppose that's because we'd been away from those characters for two or three years. It's one of our favorite shows, the American Office." [...] Gervais and Merchant spent several days debating phrasing and language, leading them to a point where they felt they had [...] "translated it pretty well" [...] for American viewers.|$|E

500|$|Numerous {{publications}} {{referred to}} it as being the band's best album in over 15 years. Alec Chillingworth of Stereoboard suggested that it saw Manson [...] "climbing back to the creative summit he fell from following Holy Wood." [...] He praised the record for its musical diversity, saying that [...] "by expanding his palette and finally <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right,</b> it reinstates Marilyn Manson as a relevant musical force, and an elder statesman of the industrial scene." [...] He awarded the album four out of five stars. Several other writers compared it to Mechanical Animals (1998). A writer for the blog Sonic Abuse said it was grander in scope than any of their albums since late 90s, and ranked it among the best releases of the band's discography.|$|E

However, Natasha then calls Chris {{to help with}} a problem {{and he has to}} leave Aidan, who assumes Chris has set the whole thing up {{to get out of the}} date. Aidan and Chris go out on another date, which marks the beginning of their relationship and Neighbours first ever gay couple. On 9 April 2012, Aidan and Chris shared their first on-screen kiss. The couple, who had not shown any sign of physical affection until that point, shared [...] "a rather passionate embrace" [...] during a house party. Morley told TV Week's Andrew Mercado that Chris and Aidan share the intimate moment as any other couple would do. Morley thought the kiss was just as awkward as any other kiss he had previously performed, but he and Mason spent a lot of time and effort into <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> for their characters. Chris and Aidan's kiss marked the serial's first male gay kiss in its twenty-seven-year history. Bower had previously promised that it would not be [...] "sensationalist or token" [...] and the low-key scene earned praise from viewers on social networking sites.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} 2006, Farah Khan's Happy New Year was shelved, and Khan had instead cast Padukone for the reincarnation melodrama Om Shanti Om (2007). Set {{against the}} {{backdrop}} of the Hindi film industry, the film tells the story of a struggling actor in the 1970s who dies soon after witnessing the murder of the woman he loved and is reincarnated to avenge her death. Shah Rukh Khan starred as the protagonist, and Padukone featured in dual rolesShantipriya, a leading actress of the 1970s, and later as Sandy, an aspiring actress. She said, [...] "I've grown up watching [...] and always admired him so much. To get to work with him... is quite wonderful. It was also fantastic that Farah showed faith in my talent and cast me opposite him." [...] In preparation for her role, Padukone watched several films of actresses Helen and Hema Malini to study their body language, which she felt [...] "were more graceful" [...] and [...] "completely different from today's actors." [...] However, her voice was dubbed by the voice artist Mona Ghosh Shetty. For one of the songs in the film, [...] "Dhoom Taana,” Padukone drew upon Indian classical dance, and according to Dorling Kindersley, [...] "mesmeriz audiences" [...] by using hasta mudras (hand gestures). Om Shanti Om was a commercial success, and emerged as the highest-grossing film of the year, with a global revenue of [...] Taran Adarsh of the entertainment portal Bollywood Hungama reviewed, [...] "Deepika has all it takes to be a top starthe personality, the looks and yes, she's supremely talented too.

500|$|The game's trivia {{is based}} on general {{knowledge}} from several fields including science, history, and geography, combined with contemporary entertainment, celebrities, and other news items; the game, {{as well as the}} series, is often described as [...] "high culture meets pop culture". For example, one question asks the players to identify which Jennifer Aniston film title would most likely have been suited for a hypothetical romantic comedy penned by Albert Einstein about the interactions between neutrons and electrons, the answer being [...] "He's Just Not That Into You". In addition to the usual questions, each episode typically features a [...] "Dis or Dat" [...] question. This question gives the players seven words or phrases which they have to identify as one of two possible classifications, or in some cases, both. For example, one Dis or Dat series asks the players to identify terms that would be features of a Nexus One phone, Nexxus shampoo, or both. In offline play, only one player participates, while other players try to steal by <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> if the main player gets it wrong. [...] In online play, all players play the Dis Or Dat simultaneously. Players are also urged to look for the [...] "Wrong Answer of the Game", which is hinted at by the show's sponsor; for example, in an episode sponsored by a baby crib company, the answer [...] "Cat's Cradle" [...] is the Wrong Answer of the Game. Choosing the correct Wrong Answer does not penalize the player but instead rewards them with a large monetary bonus. Other questions are presented in the standard multiple choice format but use recurring concepts, such as questions based on a fortune cookie message, or ones read through Cookie's ventriloquist dummy incorporating a speech impediment that may make the question harder to understand.|$|E
2500|$|Still, some {{proponents of}} the BCS {{recognize}} the inconsistency that the system offers. An article taken from BCSfootball.org titled [...] "Playoff Smayoff! We Don't Need It" [...] openly states [...] "...trust the process and we will get it right 80 percent of the time." [...] As one sports writer argued, [...] "Is it {{too much to ask}} for a system that gets it right every time" [...] instead of <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> 4 out of 5 times? It {{is interesting to note that}} FBS football is the only sport in which the NCAA has not mandated a specific bracketed playoff system, with even Division I FCS conducting a playoff every year.|$|E

2500|$|In 1982, {{prior to}} the first Black Adder series, a pilot episode was filmed which {{featured}} a number of characters who were later included in the first series. The episode, which was never televised, included {{an early version of}} the Baldrick character, played by Philip Fox, who is portrayed as slightly stupid in contrast to the intelligent, scheming Prince Edmund. Following this pilot, the writers decided to reverse this relationship when the first televised series was produced, so that Baldrick was the clever foil to the idiotic Edmund. In 2010, The Guardian reflected on this change in characterisation, suggesting that it had been a poor decision and commenting that it was [...] "an interesting example of <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> first time": ...|$|E

She played The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov. In 2015, she spoke about a childhood incident that led to her lifelong fear of water. She stated during a special event for her film Cake, [...] "I basically have a real fear of going underwater. I was a kid and I was riding this tricycle around a swimming pool and I drove my tricycle into the swimming pool and I didn't let go and my brother tried to (help).

In May 2009, Coyle announced that she had signed a publishing deal with EMI. She told Late Late Show host Pat Kenny, [...] "I'm writing songs and it's slightly different styles from Girls Aloud, so I'm gonna do that, writing stuff after Girls Aloud. [...] I have loads of material of stuff to do, but it's just about the timing and about <b>getting</b> <b>it</b> <b>right</b> and getting the right songs to put out." [...] She enlisted Barbara Charone, who was worked with Madonna and Christina Aguilera, as a publicist and Bruce Garfield as her manager. [...] "There wasn't anything wrong with what had happened or what had gone on for years - because it was really successful," [...] Nadine said. [...] "It just seemed like I had taken a completely different route, personally, in the writing and the production and I wanted a completely new team so we could start afresh." [...] Despite early reports indicating three major record labels interested in Nadine, it was reported that she had failed to earn a solo record deal, even being turned down by Girls Aloud's label Polydor Records. This was denied by manager Bruce Garfield. In April 2010, it was reported she had signed to Geffen Records. The deal later fell through.|$|E
