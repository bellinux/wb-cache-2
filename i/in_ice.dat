5|$|A {{polar ice}} cap, or polar ice sheet, is a high-latitude region {{of a planet}} or moon that is covered <b>in</b> <b>ice.</b> Ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy as solar {{radiation}} from the sun than equatorial regions, resulting in lower surface temperatures.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{evidence}} of the oxygen atmosphere comes from spectral detection of gases trapped in the ice at the surface of Ganymede. The detection of ozone (O3) bands was announced in 1996. In 1997 spectroscopic analysis revealed the dimer (or diatomic) absorption features of molecular oxygen. Such an absorption can arise only if the oxygen is in a dense phase. The best candidate is molecular oxygen trapped <b>in</b> <b>ice.</b> The depth of the dimer absorption bands depends on latitude and longitude, rather than on surface albedo—they tend to decrease with increasing latitude on Ganymede, whereas O3 shows an opposite trend. Laboratory work has found that O2 would not cluster or bubble but dissolve <b>in</b> <b>ice</b> at Ganymede's relatively warm surface temperature of 100 K (−173.15°C).|$|E

40|$|We {{monitored}} the spatiotemporal progression of chromophoric {{dissolved organic matter}} (CDOM) <b>in</b> first-year sea <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the western Canadian Arctic between mid-March and early July 2008. CDOM abundance <b>in</b> bottom <b>ice,</b> as quantified by absorption coefficient at 325 nm, a(CDOM) (325), showed a positive, linear relationship with the concentration of chlorophyll a, being low {{at the start of}} ice algal accumulation, highly enriched during the peak bloom and early post-bloom, and depleted again during sea ice melting. Vertical profiles of CDOM in early and late spring were typically characterized by slight to moderate elevations at both the surface and bottom and rather constancy within the interior <b>ice.</b> <b>In</b> the <b>ice</b> algae-thriving mid-spring, L-type profiles prevailed due to extremely high CDOM in the lowermost 10 -cm layer. Bottom-layer CDOM <b>in</b> landfast <b>ice</b> (a(CDOM) (325) : 15. 8 m(- 1)) more than doubled that <b>in</b> drift <b>ice</b> (a(CDOM) (325) : 6. 6 m(- 1)). CDOM <b>in</b> the <b>ice</b> cover, except the bottom layer, was generally lower than or similar to that in the under-ice surface water. Salinity accounted for 58 % of the CDOM variability <b>in</b> drift <b>ice</b> having minimal terrestrial and ice algal signatures. CDOM absorption spectra of algaerich bottom ice samples exhibited ultraviolet (UV) absorption shoulders attributable to mycosporine-like amino acids (MAAs). These compounds were readily photodegradable by solar UV radiation. Our results suggest that 1) inclusion of organic solutes and in situ biological production are the dominant processes controlling the distribution of CDOM <b>in</b> sea <b>ice</b> <b>in</b> the study area, 2) biological production <b>in</b> bottom <b>ice</b> is a minor source of CDOM to the underlying surface water; 3) CDOM plays a critical role in shielding sympagic organisms <b>in</b> bottom <b>ice</b> against UV radiation; 4) the MAAs are effective photoprotectants only under low-UV conditions.

5000|$|The pylons and {{conductors}} {{are designed}} to handle 45 millimetres (1.8 <b>in)</b> of <b>ice</b> accumulation without failure, since Hydro-Québec raised the standards <b>in</b> response to <b>ice</b> storms <b>in</b> Ottawa in December 1986 and Montreal in February 1961, which left 30 to 40 millimetres (1.2 to 1.6 <b>in)</b> of <b>ice.</b> This {{has led to the}} belief that Hydro-Québec TransÉnergie's electrical pylons are [...] "indestructible".

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} scaling methods which {{permit the}} use of subscale models <b>in</b> <b>icing</b> wind tunnels to simulate natural flight <b>in</b> <b>icing.</b> Natural icing conditions exist when air temperatures are below freezing but cloud water droplets are super-cooled liquid. Aircraft flying through such clouds are susceptible to the accretion of ice on the leading edges of unprotected components such as wings, tailplane and engine inlets. To establish the aerodynamic penalties of such ice accretion and to determine what parts need to be protected from ice accretion (by heating, for example), extensive flight and wind-tunnel testing is necessary for new aircraft and components. Testing <b>in</b> <b>icing</b> tunnels is less expensive than flight testing, is safer, and permits better control of the test conditions. However, because of limitations on both model size and operating conditions in wind tunnels, it is often necessary to perform tests with either size or test conditions scaled. This paper describes the theoretical background to the development of icing scaling methods, discusses four methods, and presents results of tests to validate them...|$|R
