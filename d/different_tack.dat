5|$|Work on an {{alternative}} method of bomb design, known as implosion, had begun by Neddermeyer's E-5 (Implosion) group. Serber and Tolman had conceived implosion during the April 1943 conferences {{as a means}} of assembling pieces of fissionable material together to form a critical mass. Neddermeyer took a <b>different</b> <b>tack,</b> attempting to crush a hollow cylinder into a solid bar. The idea was to use explosives to crush a subcritical amount of fissile material into a smaller and denser form. When the fissile atoms are packed closer together, the rate of neutron capture increases, and they form a critical mass. The metal needs to travel only a very short distance, so the critical mass is assembled in much less time than it would take with the gun method. At the time, the idea of using explosives in this manner was quite novel. To facilitate the work, a small plant was established at the Anchor Ranch for casting explosive shapes.|$|E

40|$|In {{spite of}} the witty saying that more books {{have been written about}} Richard Wagner than anyone else except Jesus Christ and Napoleon Bonaparte, I will venture to sail into the high seas. This essay is the first {{installment}} of a trilogy devoted to Wagner’s Tristan—a musical lament, indeed the cornerstone of modern(ist) art. Taking my cue from Eduardo Lourenço’s self-questioning remark on such powerful music, ‘By what mysterious means?’, I shall examine it anew, trying <b>different</b> <b>tacks.</b> The complete text— literary, theoretical and analytical—weaves through music and language. ‘Music in language’ is a preliminary attempt to explore sensual, artistic sound qualities in the word. ‘The language of music’, then, puts forward a grammar for tonal music as it may be sensed in a wider panorama of the evolving Western consciousness. ‘Music as language’, eventually, offers a novel approach to Wagner’s musicopoetic process: I thus seek to unravel that distinctive longing (Sehnen) of the so-called ‘Tristan chord’, resonating throughout the drama, and how it turns into Isolde’s blissful transfiguration. Only the first, literary part will be presented here. Significant figures of literary culture are summoned up with regard to that otherwise Portuguese soul experience of nostalgic longing—hence untranslatable—they call saudade. A broad, comparative survey of the shifting balance over time between music and language is then offered, which begs the fundamental question of artistic truth: either creative or reflective, it is a sort of harmony or consonance with reality, entailing different perspectives and multifarious voices. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R

60|$|Sure of such active {{assistance}} on shore, Yawkins demeaned {{himself so}} boldly that his mere name was a terror to the {{officers of the}} revenue. He availed himself of the fears which his presence inspired on one particular night, when, happening to be ashore with a considerable quantity of goods in his sole custody, a strong party of excisemen came down on him. Far from shunning the attack, Yawkins sprung forward, shouting, 'Come on, my lads; Yawkins is before you.' The revenue officers were intimidated and relinquished their prize, though defended only by the courage and address of a single man. On his proper element Yawkins was equally successful. On one occasion he was landing his cargo at the Manxman's Lake near Kirkcudbright, when two revenue cutters (the 'Pigmy' and the 'Dwarf') hove in sight at once on <b>different</b> <b>tacks,</b> the one coming round by the Isles of Fleet, the other between the point of Rueberry and the Muckle Ron. The dauntless freetrader instantly weighed anchor and bore down right between the luggers, so close that he tossed his hat {{on the deck of}} the one and his wig on that of the other, hoisted a cask to his maintop, to show his occupation, and bore away under an extraordinary pressure of canvass, without receiving injury. To account for these and other hairbreadth escapes, popular superstition alleged that Yawkins insured his celebrated buckkar by compounding with the devil for one-tenth of his crew every voyage. How they arranged the separation of the stock and tithes is left to our conjecture. The buckkar was perhaps called the 'Black Prince' in honour of the formidable insurer.|$|R

Their hours, their habits, their friends, their ways were in all things unlike. And then, moreover, Bertram no longer liked the successful barrister. It may be said that he had learned positively to dislike him. It was not that Harcourt had caused this wound which was tearing his heart to pieces; at least, he thought that it was not that. He declared to himself a dozen times that he did not blame Harcourt. He blamed no one but Caroline--her and himself. Nor was it because the man was so successful. Bertram certainly did not envy him. But the one as he advanced in manhood became worldly, false, laborious, exact, polished, rich, and agreeable among casual acquaintances. The other was the very reverse. He was generous and true; but idle--idle at any rate for any good; he was thoughtful, but cloudy in his thoughts, indifferent as to society, poor, much poorer than he had been as a lad at college, and was by no means gifted with the knack of making pretty conversation for the world at large. Of late whenever they had met, Harcourt had said something which grated painfully on the other's inner sensibilities, and hence had arisen this dislike.|$|R

Remarkables:--An author at the American Stationers' Company, {{slapping}} {{his hand}} on his manuscript, and crying, [...] "I'm going to publish."--An excursion aboard a steamboat to Thompson's Island, to visit the Manual Labor School for boys. Aboard the steamboat several poets and various other authors; a Commodore,--Colton, a small, dark brown, sickly man, with a good deal of roughness in his address; Mr. Waterston, talking poetry and philosophy. Examination and exhibition of the boys, little tanned agriculturists. After examination, a stroll round the island, examining the products, as wheat in sheaves on the stubble-field; oats, somewhat blighted and spoiled; great pumpkins elsewhere; pastures; mowing ground;--all cultivated by the boys. Their residence, a great brick building, painted green, and standing on the summit of a rising ground, exposed to the winds of the bay. Vessels flitting past; great ships, with intricacy of rigging and various sails; schooners, sloops, with their one or two broad sheets of canvas: going on <b>different</b> <b>tacks,</b> so that the spectator might think that there was a different wind for each vessel, or that they scudded across the sea spontaneously, whither their own wills led them. The farm boys remain insulated, looking at the passing show, within sight of the city, yet having nothing to do with it; beholding their fellow-creatures skimming by them in winged machines, and steamboats snorting and puffing through the waves. Methinks an island would be the most desirable of all landed property, for it seems like a little world by itself; and the water may answer instead of the atmosphere that surrounds planets. The boys swinging, two together, standing up, and almost causing the ropes and their bodies to stretch out horizontally. On our departure, they ranged themselves on the rails of the fence, and, being dressed in blue, looked not unlike a flock of pigeons.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The aim of {{the thesis}} was to explore the {{clinical}} and radiographic results after post- traumatic anterior shoulder instability treated with arthroscopic Bankart surgery using absorbable <b>tacks</b> with <b>different</b> compositions. Further aims were to explore possible effects on bone mineral in the heel bone and health-related quality of life after a shoulder-stabilising surgical procedure. Study I was a clinical long-term study of 81 patients (84 shoulders) operated on using tacks made of PGA (polygluconate B polymer). The majority of patients had good functional results after eight years, although 18 % had recurrent instability. Study II was a randomised, controlled study (RCT) using two <b>different</b> <b>tacks,</b> PGA and PLLA (poly-L-lactate acid polymer), with a clinical and radiographic evaluation after seven years. The drill holes after implanting PLLA tacks (18 patients) had healed {{to a lesser extent}} (55 % unhealed) than those after implanting PGA tacks (17 patients), (0 % unhealed), seven years after the operation. There were no differences between the groups regarding radiographic degenerative findings or functional results. Study III (32 patients, 34 shoulders) was a clinical and radiographic two- and eight-year follow-up after reconstruction using PGA implants. As in Study II, the radiographs were classified with regard to the drill-hole appearance and degenerative changes. In Study III, the radiological degenerative changes increased from no changes preoperatively to 24 % mild and 18 % moderate degenerative changes eight years postoperatively. In Study IV (23 patients), bone mineral was evaluated using Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) combined with laser measurement in the heel bone preoperatively and until five years postoperatively. Activity level was classified according to Tegner activity level and health-related quality of life was classified with the Euroqol 5 -dimension (EQ- 5 D) instrument. The bone mineral had decreased by 6 % in the calcaneus five years after the operation. The activity level did not increase, but the EQ- 5 D increased after the operation...|$|R

Further, Kerr notes the design was not up to the standards Daimler and Maybach's engineering skill, because they had no interest at the time in motorcycles, but only wanted an expedient test bed for their engine, and immediately dropped the Reitwagen {{in favor of}} a four wheeled stagecoach, a hot air balloon and a boat for their ongoing research.

40|$|A {{bituminous}} pavement is a multi-layered structure generally {{made up of}} surfacing, base and sub base courses on a sub grade. An interface {{is said to be}} a boundary between any two consecutive layers. So an adequate bond between the layers at the interfaces must be ensured so that multiple layers perform as a single composite structure. In case of non-bituminous layers or bituminous-non bituminous layers, adequate bond is established as such due to the mechanical interlocking between the aggregate surfaces. To increase the adhesion or bonding between two bituminous layers, bituminous tack coats are applied prior to overlay. This study is an attempt to evaluate the interface bond strength between two types of bituminous layer combinations in the laboratory. The cylindrical specimens have been tested for bond strength at four normal service temperatures, namely 250, 300, 350 and 400 C by applying <b>different</b> types of <b>tack</b> coat at varying application rates. Two types of layer combinations have been tried, namely (i) Bituminous Concrete (BC) layer on Dense Bituminous Macadam (DBM) samples and (ii) Semi Dense Bituminous Concrete (SDBC) layer on Bituminous Macadam (BM) samples. Similarly, <b>different</b> types of <b>tack</b> coat materials namely bitumen, Cationic Rapid Setting with low viscosity (CRS- 1) and Cationic Medium Setting with high viscosity (CMS- 2) emulsions have been used for the interface bond between the said bituminous layers. The samples thus prepared have then been tested on a specially fabricated attachment (named bond strength device) fixed to the loading frame of the Modified Marshall Testing Apparatus. It is observed that the interlayer bond strength depends on the test temperature and this decreases with increase in test temperature. It is also observed that the bond strength depends on the type of tack coat used and conditions of the type of combinations. The optimum amount of tack coat has been found to vary for tack coat type and layer combination type...|$|R
2500|$|In two {{important}} papers in 1810 and 1811, Laplace first developed the characteristic {{function as a}} tool for large-sample theory and proved the first general central limit theorem. Then in a supplement to his 1810 paper written after he had seen Gauss's work, he showed that the central limit theorem provided a Bayesian justification for least squares: if one were combining observations, each one of which was itself the mean {{of a large number of}} independent observations, then the least squares estimates would not only maximise the likelihood function, considered as a posterior distribution, but also minimise the expected posterior error, all this without any assumption as to the error distribution or a circular appeal to the principle of the arithmetic mean. In 1811 Laplace took a <b>different</b> non-Bayesian <b>tack.</b> Considering a linear regression problem, he restricted his attention to linear unbiased estimators of the linear coefficients. After showing that members of this class were approximately normally distributed if the number of observations was large, he argued that least squares provided the [...] "best" [...] linear estimators. Here it is [...] "best" [...] in the sense that it minimised the asymptotic variance and thus both minimised the expected absolute value of the error, and maximised the probability that the estimate would lie in any symmetric interval about the unknown coefficient, no matter what the error distribution. His derivation included the joint limiting distribution of the least squares estimators of two parameters.|$|R

40|$|Nonprofit, {{community-based}} {{housing development}} organizations {{have only recently}} become significant players {{in the provision of}} affordable housing, at least in the United States. Historically, this job was left either in the hands of builders, developers, lenders and landlords of the business sector or in the care of agencies, planners and policymakers of the public sector. Only in the past 30 years has the provision of affordable housing moved beyond the familiar domains of the market and the state. A host of nonprofit organizations is now playing a larger role in constructing new housing, rehabilitating older housing, managing rentals and bringing home ownership within the reach of thousands of people for whom the American dream has proved elusive. The growth of these third-sector organizations has been both rapid and impressive, but it also has been uneven. Across the country, there are places where nonprofit housing development organizations are both plentiful and productive, supported by sophisticated networks of interorganizational collaboration, public funding, private financing and technical assistance. There are many other communities, however, where no nonprofits are engaged in affordable housing or where the ones that do exist are very new or very small, accounting for only a handful of new housing units every year. Lying between these two extremes are those communities where multiple nonprofits of varying size serve a similar geographic area, each producing a modest but respectable number of housing units; each competing for constituents, funding and development opportunities; each struggling to survive. The organizations that find themselves in this uncomfortable situation often confront a special set of challenges. They are productive, but not prolific. They are effective, but not efficient. They are successful, but not sustainable. Indeed, they are frequently quite precarious. The loss of a single staff person, the delay of a single project or the adverse decision of a single funder can threaten not only their short-term chances for success, but their long term prospects for survival. Those who sponsor and fund such organizations sometimes find themselves in a situation where competition among multiple nonprofits is weakening them all. In these cases, the sponsoring and funding organizations have taken <b>different</b> <b>tacks</b> to address this problem. In some cases, they have acted to strengthen every nonprofit, while working to increase the division of labor or the division of territory among them. In other cases, they have acted to strengthen one (or more) nonprofit {{at the expense of the}} others, culling weaker performers from the herd. While these have been the most common approaches for dealing with the weaknesses that organizational competition and duplication can sometimes create, a third alternative has been gaining ground. Multiple nonprofits, operating within the same jurisdiction, are being encouraged to collaborate [...] even to the point of merging their programs, assets and hard-won identities. Why is collaboration gaining in popularity? A financial explanation would be that it is becoming harder to find enough resources to strengthen every nonprofit to the same degree, funding multiple nonprofits to serve a similar clientele in the same locale. There is also the political reality that public and private funders find it difficult to choose easily (or accurately) which nonprofits should live [...] and which should die. There is a practical explanation as well. Collaboration is becoming a strategy of choice simply because it is proving to be an unusually effective way of achieving greater productivity, efficiency and sustainability. When a collaborative (or a merger) is carefully crafted, the nonprofit partners do a better job together than they did apart. This is not true in every case, of course.

40|$|Between Communism and Globalization: The Crisis of Culture's Critical Conscience (Ukraine and Belarus') &# 13; &# 13; The {{fall of the}} Berlin Wall did {{not bring}} about. as people hoped. a rapid shift to {{democracy}} in Eastern European countries. The changeover from a. closed society. to an. open society. {{has proved to be}} much tougher than expected, fraught as it is with uncertainty and social unrest. First and foremost, the necessary straightforward {{coming to terms with the}} totalitarian past has not taken place. As a result, the gap between development in the West and the East has grown wider. Moreover, The West has been confronted with a most fragmented East ranging from Central Eastern Europe to Russia and the Balcans. Obviously, specific cultural traits underlie so many <b>different</b> <b>tacks</b> on the road to democracy. In going deeper into the phenomenon, two basic factors stand out: the political factor proper and the cultural factor at large. In point of fact, the road to democracy is particularly tough when it comes to the countries of Eastern Christianity, heirs to Byzanthium. s cultural heritage. In this area the tradition of a top-down structure is still very much alive, hampering on one side the building up of a civil society worth the name, and, on the other side, harbouring a new harvest of mafia-oriented economic ventures. As a matter of fact, politologists are actually talking of neototalitarianism on the political level, and neocolonization on the cultural level. The. Unfinished Revolution. has not led to a fruitful encounter between East and West, but rather to basic lack of communication, if not downright clash. The. Byzantine Slavic Triangle. (Russia, Belarus. and Ukraine) is quite pecular, with centrifugal and centripetal forces at work all at once. To start with, Russia is busy working on the building of a neo-imperialistic identity of its own, Eurasia. In its attempt, Russia is basically alien to those very principles that lie at the foundation of a European-style democracy. In Belarus. and Ukraine, instead, you can witness to different responses to the basic problem of coping with the totalitarian heritage. Thus, these two border-countries are quite enlightening in their respective endeavour. In particular, the degree of russification and/or sovietization is proving crucial, and this very basic fact can be traced back to underlying cultural factors still extant in the fabric of each of the two countries. In fact, Belarus., still very much imbued with neo-totalitarian traits, seems much more inclined to go in for the. Russian Choice., in spite of the strenuous resistence of its intelligentsia. Ukraine, instead, historically the very bridge between a Byzantine East and a humanistic West is still struggling at a crossroads. Ukrainian civilization, with its polimorphic culture (a tangle of more churches and more languages), has been able in the course of centuries to develop its typical culture of dialogue. That. s why the Ukrainian. republican tradition. enables the country to better counter the process of homogenization (once imperial and later sovietic) now under way and consequently stands a better chance to take the road to democracy. A staunchly pro-European opposition is doing everything in its power to stem the totalitarian trend. And there are still independent media which manage to make themselves heard. In other words, in Ukraine an alternative to the power in office is still possible. To conclude, Ukraine is indeed the last laboratory available in the construction of democracy in the Slavic-orthodox post communist universe. Whether Ukraine can manage or not to go the democratic way is crucial to the very set-up of tomorrow. s enlarged Europe as a whole. Politically it could develop into Europe. s easternmost frontier, and, culturally, it could contribute with its diversified lore to the very wealth of a most authentic Europe...|$|R
40|$|The {{state of}} {{adhesion}} at {{the interface between}} two asphalt layers has significant influence on the stress distribution across pavement layers under traffic loads. It is generally believed that the pavement stress distribution is highly influenced by the adhesion conditions at the interface. This means that poor adhesion between layers will have adverse affects on the structural strength of the asphalt layers leading to premature fatigue failure. To increase bonding between layers, asphalt tack coats are applied prior to overlay. In spite of their wide application, the opinions among pavement engineers differ regarding the effectiveness of tack coat in enhancing the adhesion between two layers. The main objective {{of this research was}} to design a simple and efficient test protocol for the evaluation of tack coats based on adhesion strength, which could be used for different materials. The University of Waterloo developed a simple shear test by applying three point loading on asphalt briquettes, for evaluating the effectiveness of <b>different</b> types of <b>tack</b> coats available in the market. The cylindrical testing setup enables the use of the cored samples from the field or the samples prepared in the laboratory. This paper describes testing procedures developed using the Marshall loading frame and presents the results carried out on specimens with and without tack coat interface {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} proposed shear tests. Pure tack coats were also investigated in dynamic mode with the assumption, that materials are characterized within linear viscoelastic region...|$|R
