50|$|A typical topsite {{configuration}} {{will only}} allow users {{to log in}} from a certain ident and host (or <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> for users with dynamic IPs), with SSL encapsulation on all FTP sessions. FTP bouncers are commonly used to hide the topsite's real IP address, and to share network load.|$|E

50|$|Traceroute is {{also used}} by {{penetration}} testers to gather information about network infrastructure and <b>IP</b> <b>ranges</b> around a given host.|$|R
50|$|ADNs {{often have}} the ability to filter traffic based on Access Control Lists (ACLs), Bogus <b>IP</b> <b>ranges</b> (Bogon filtering) and deep packet {{inspection}} pattern matching. In some cases, thresholds or rate limiting of <b>IP</b> addresses or <b>ranges</b> of <b>IP</b> addresses may be employed.|$|R
50|$|Google Compute Engine {{offers a}} routing table to manage how traffic destined {{for a certain}} <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> should be routed. Similar to a {{physical}} router in the local area network, all outbound traffic is compared to the routes table and forwarded appropriately if the outbound packet matches any rules in the routes table.|$|E
5000|$|Fans {{found that}} a new Nine Inch Nails tour T-shirt {{contained}} highlighted letters that spell out the words [...] "I am trying to believe." [...] It was discovered that iamtryingtobelieve.com was registered as a website, and soon several related websites {{were found in the}} <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> (Another Version of the Truth, Be the Hammer, 105th Airborne Crusaders, and Church of Plano), all describing a dystopian vision of the world fifteen years in the future.|$|E
5000|$|To avoid {{addressing}} {{conflict with}} the internet itself, anoNet initially used the <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> 1.0.0.0/8. This is to avoid conflicting with internal networks such as 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12 and 192.168.0.0/16, as well as assigned Internet ranges. In January 2010 IANA allocated 1.0.0.0/8 to APNIC. [...] In Match 2017 anoNet changed the network to use the 21.0.0.0/8 subnetwork, which is assigned to the United States Department of Defense but is not currently in use on the internet.|$|E

50|$|Because mDNS {{operates}} under {{a different}} trust model than unicast DNS—trusting the entire network rather than a designated DNS server, it is vulnerable to spoofing attacks by any system within the multicast <b>IP</b> <b>range.</b> Like SNMP and many other network management protocols, {{it can also be}} used by attackers to quickly gain detailed knowledge of the network and its machines. Because of this, applications should still authenticate and encrypt traffic to remote hosts (e.g. via RSA, SSH, etc.) after discovering and resolving them through DNS-SD/mDNS.|$|E
50|$|On an Internet Protocol (IP) network, clients should {{automatically}} send IP packets with {{a destination}} outside a given subnet mask {{to a network}} gateway. A subnet mask defines the <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> of a private network. For example, if a private network has a base IP address of 192.168.0.0 and has a subnet mask of 255.255.255.0, then any data going to an IP address outside of 192.168.0.X {{will be sent to}} that network's gateway. While forwarding an IP packet to another network, the gateway might or might not perform Network Address Translation.|$|E
50|$|To {{combat the}} {{problems}} posed by botnets, open relays, and proxy servers, many email server administrators pre-emptively block dynamic IP ranges and impose stringent requirements on other servers wishing to deliver mail. Forward-confirmed reverse DNS must be correctly {{set for the}} outgoing mail server and large swaths of IP addresses are blocked, sometimes pre-emptively, to prevent spam. These measures can pose problems for those wanting to run a small email server off an inexpensive domestic connection. Blacklisting of IP ranges due to spam emanating from them also causes problems for legitimate email servers in the same <b>IP</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E
50|$|For example, the Nintendo Wi-Fi USB Connector {{will cause}} an IP {{conflict}} if an existing network {{is using the}} 192.168.0.x or 192.168.1.x IP schemes, both common <b>IP</b> <b>ranges</b> used in consumer routers.|$|R
5000|$|Scanners scan <b>IP</b> <b>ranges</b> for {{vulnerable}} {{computers with}} a fast internet connection. Once a vulnerable {{system has been}} found, the information is {{passed on to the}} rest of the board and subsequently the [...] "hackers".|$|R
50|$|<b>Ip</b> <b>ranges</b> between +1 and -1 with 95% {{confidence}} intervals of ±0.5. Ip has {{the value of}} 0 if the pattern is random; if the pattern is uniform, Ip < 0 and if the pattern shows aggregation, Ip > 0.|$|R
5000|$|The biggest {{delay in}} getting RDAP done {{turned out to}} be the bootstrap, {{figuring}} out where the server is for each top level domain, <b>IP</b> <b>range,</b> or ASN range. IANA agreed to host the bootstrap information in suitable registries, and publish it at a well-known location URLs in JSON format. Those registries started empty and will be gradually populated as registrants of domains and address spaces provide RDAP server information to IANA. [...] For number registries, ARIN set up a public RDAP service which also features a bootstrap URL, similar to what they do for WHOIS. [...] For name registries, ICANN requires RDAP compliance since 2013.|$|E
5000|$|On 12 June at noon local time, the AS and <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> of ERT, the {{official}} domain names [...] "ert.gr", [...] "ert3.gr", and [...] "voiceofgreece.gr" [...] were cancelled in the Greek Internet registry, meaning that live broadcasts on the Internet (ERT LIVE) have stopped, {{as well as}} the publication of all news articles. Emails sent to the broadcasters are no longer delivered. Other Internet assets registered by ERT are at risk of being closed (because their owner and contact address are no longer valid), notably {{the official}} Facebook page and Twitter account. ERT LIVE is relayed by other sites, such as the University of Greece.|$|E

50|$|On April 26, 2010, Demonoid.com, started {{experiencing}} downtime or extreme slowness. A {{message was}} {{posted on the}} site that {{it was due to}} a denial-of-service attack, which has subsided as of July 2010. The site temporarily banned Taiwanese and Chinese <b>IP</b> <b>ranges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Listia uses a {{third party}} Sift Science which uses {{large-scale}} machine learning to automatically discover new fraud patterns. These patterns are found by checking particular page navigation sequences, <b>IP</b> <b>ranges,</b> email address patterns, graph connectivity structures, browser configurations, and various others. An example Sift Science gives is that a user who signs up and waits an hour before making a purchase is 7x more likely to generate a chargeback than a user who makes a purchase immediately after signup.|$|R
50|$|The {{exchange}} {{shut down}} {{some time in}} 2006 to 2007 and although the <b>IP</b> address <b>range</b> is still announced by Netegral, the website no longer exists.|$|R
50|$|Z-lines {{also work}} {{slightly}} differently from K-lines. Z-lines are typically set as *@IP or *@host, {{with the first}} being the better option. Z-lines do not wait for an ident response from the connecting user, but immediately close the socket once the user's IP is compared to the Z-line list and a match is found. If the *@host option is used, the server must conduct a reverse DNS lookup on the user and then compare the returned host to the hosts in the Z-line list. This can result in delays, or if the DNS doesn't return correctly, banned users could still get on the network. In actuality, the *@host option is completely against the intentions of using a Z-line, and therefore some IRCd programs will not allow anything other than *@IP, with wildcards (?,*) or CIDR prefix lengths (e.g. /8) allowed in the IP section to block entire subnets. Another difference from K-lines (which affect only IRC clients) is if an IP is banned, nothing, not even other servers, can connect from this IP (or <b>IP</b> <b>range,</b> depending on the banmask).|$|E

30|$|The Sibu Laut River {{contained}} {{extremely low}} concentrations of IP {{with an average}} of 0.003  mg l− 1. The result was comparable to the study of Troussellier et al. (2004) who reported the orthophosphate concentration was 0.03  µmol l− 1 (≈ 0.001  mg l− 1) in the Senegal River Estuary. On the other hand, the concentration of IP {{in the present study was}} considerably lower than a Pearl River estuarine system of Hong Kong (Huang et al. 2003) and Kalpakkam Estuary in India (Satpathy et al. 2010) with an <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> of 0.007 – 0.017  mg l− 1 and 0.05 – 1.96  μmol l− 1 (≈ 0.002 – 0.061  mg l− 1), respectively.|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} the first {{heuristic}} for fully distributed bootstrapping of peer-to-peer networks. Our heuristic generates {{a stream of}} promising IP addresses to be probed as entry points. This stream is generated using statistical profiles using the <b>IP</b> <b>ranges</b> of start-of-authorities (SOAs) in the domain name system (DNS). We present experimental results demonstrating that with this approach it is efficient and practical to bootstrap Gnutella-sized peerto-peer networks – {{without the need for}} centralized services or the public exposure of end-user’s private IP addresses. ...|$|R
50|$|The DDMa {{component}} (Discovery and Dependency mapping Advanced) of UCMDB {{works by}} scanning <b>ranges</b> of <b>IP</b> addresses within pre-set probe <b>IP</b> <b>ranges,</b> using ping, ICMP echo requests and Nmap to locate live IP addresses and open ports, and IP address harvesting techniques by querying ARP/Cache tables of level 3 network devices. Resulting current IP addresses are then translated into CI's which function as input for higher (deeper) level discovery. The pyramid model makes sure only relevant sources are being queried, resulting in lower network and node load.|$|R

40|$|Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack {{mitigation}} sys-tems usually {{generate a}} list of filter rules in order to block malicious traffic. In contrast to this binary decision we sug-gest to use traffic shaping whereas the bandwidth limit {{is defined by the}} probability of a source to be a legal user. As a proof of concept, we implemented a simple high perfor-mance Linux kernel module nf-HiShape which is able to shape thousands of source IP addresses at different band-width limits even under high packet rates. Our shaping algo-rithm is comparable to Random Early Detection (RED) applied on every single source <b>IP</b> <b>range.</b> The evaluation shows, that our kernel module can handle up to 50, 000 IP ranges at nearly constant throughput whereas Linux tc al-ready decreases throughput at about 200 ranges. 1...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In this paper, I {{describe}} an intelligent agent crawling the Gnutella peer-to-peer net-work {{in order to}} detect clients in a certain <b>IP</b> <b>range.</b> This tool is helpful for administrator trying to avoid wasting bandwidth due to peer-to-peer file sharing programs. Moreover, almost all files shared over the internet are illegal – like non-licensed MP 3 music – {{which can lead to}} po-tential law suits. In the past years, security leaks are often found in various server programs. Peer-to-peer network established as one of the major sources for internet viruses and worms. On the following pages, I will evaluate the opportunities and challenges of monitoring the Gnutella network from the technical, commercial and social point of view. I describe the implementation of GnutellaWatch which is a easy-to-use Java program suitable even for personnel without a broad understanding of network technology...|$|E
30|$|Communication between nodes {{utilizes}} non-persistent socket connections, {{such that}} the controller node maintains a static pre-determined port for receiving messages, while other nodes may use any available port on the system. Thus, each node in the cloud, excluding the controller node, automatically selects an available port at boot time. Initial communication between nodes is done during boot time to establish {{a connection to the}} controller node. We utilize a methodology for automatically finding and connecting to the controller node via linear search over the fourth octet of the private <b>IP</b> <b>range</b> (xxx.xxx.xxx. 0 to xxx.xxx.xxx. 255). Our assumption in this case is that the controller node will exist on a predefined subnet that allows us to easily establish lines of communication without having to manually register nodes. Additionally, we can guarantee sequential ordering of IP addresses with our privately managed DHCP server. Once a communication link is established between a node and the controller node, the node will request membership within a specific logical group, after which communication between the controller node and that logical group will contain the node in question.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept of}} the [...] "anti-worm", or [...] "helpful worm", is a {{proactive}} method of dealing with virus and computer worm outbreaks. This type of worm delivers its payload by doing helpful actions instead of malicious actions. Just like malicious computer worms, anti-worms reach computers by scanning <b>IP</b> <b>ranges</b> and placing a copy of themselves on vulnerable hosts. The anti-worm then patches the computer's vulnerability and uses the affected computer to find other vulnerable hosts. Anti-worms {{have the ability to}} spread just as fast as regular computer worms, utilizing the same [...] "scan, infect, repeat" [...] model that malicious computer worms use.|$|R
