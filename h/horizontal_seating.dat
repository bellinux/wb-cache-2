40|$|Background and Purpose Because it is {{debatable}} whether seat surface inclination improves motor function {{in children with}} cerebral palsy (CP), the effect of seat surface tilting on postural control and quality of reaching was studied. Subjects The subjects were 58 children with CP aged 2 to 11 years (34 with unilateral spastic CP, 24 with bilateral spastic Cl?). Methods During the task of reaching movements, surface electromyographic and kinematic data were recorded for posture and reaching with the dominant arm in 3 sitting conditions: <b>horizontal</b> <b>seat</b> surface, seat surface tilted forward 15 degrees, and seat surface tilted back-ward 15 degrees. Results In the children with unilateral spastic CP, forward tilting improved postural efficiency and quality of reaching. In the children with bilateral spastic CP, both forward and backward tilting of the seat surface was associated with more postural instability and {{did not affect the}} quality of reaching. Discussion and Conclusion The results suggest that, in terms of postural control and quality of reaching, children with unilateral spastic CP benefit from a forward-tilted position and children with bilateral spastic CP benefit from a horizontal sitting position...|$|R

30|$|Spirometric {{measurements}} {{taken when}} standing {{were compared to}} four sitting positions (Figure  1). These were; a) sitting in an upright chair with a <b>horizontal</b> <b>seat,</b> {{feet on the floor}} and with the trunk at 90 ° to the thighs [here referred to as “sit flat”], b) sitting with the trunk vertical on a seat that sloped downwards so that the angle between the trunk and thighs was 115 ° [“slope down”], c) sitting on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>seat</b> with the back reclining so that the angle between the thighs and the trunk was 122 ° [“slope back”] and d) sitting with trunk vertical and the thighs sloping upwards to make an angle of 65 ° with the trunk [“slope up”]. Ergonomic chairs with kneeling or saddle designs require a trunk to thigh angle of 110 °– 125 ° (Bettany-Saltikov et al. 2008; Gandavadi and Ramsay 2005). These have a pommel or knee support to prevent the sitter slipping off. We chose 115 ° for “sit slope” as the steepest angle that could comfortably be maintained without slipping. Positions c) and d) were extreme positions in which the biomechanics of breathing should be considerably altered. The liver (weight around 1.5  kg in the adult male) is attached to the underside of the diaphragm and gravity contributes to its descent during inhalation. In more supine positions such as “slope back”, this effect is reduced (Hoit 1995). The angle used is also said to minimise intervertebral disk pressure and postural muscle activity (Harrison et al. 1999). Reducing the angle between the trunk and thighs to 65 ° (“slope up”) would be expected to restrict anterior abdominal wall expansion and restrict the descent of the diaphragm. The subjects were 30 undergraduate students (13 males, 17 females of Caucasian origin) from the Royal Welsh College of Music (RWCMD) and Drama and Cardiff University, age 20.7 [*]±[*] 1.0  yrs (mean[*]±[*]s.d.), mean BMI 23.3 [*]±[*] 3.6.

50|$|The {{question}} is “In what scenario” {{it would be}} beneficial to use computer-aided ergonomics compared to traditional ergonomics. First of all computer aided ergonomics using for example a musculo-skeletal modeling system as The Modeling systemhttp://www.anybodytech.com, would be beneficial in physical ergonomics, which traditional combines aspects from the human anatomical, anthropometric, physiological and biomechanical characteristics related to some physical activity. The model can provide a quantitative foundation for ergonomic design and recommendations. Traditionally “Ergonomics” {{has been based on}} recommendations derived from empirical data from various working tasks; if many people get injured from working in a certain posture, it is recommended to avoid working in that posture. However, when applying the recommendations to another related working posture, the posture or the movement often does not match exactly. This means that the theory and recommendations does not apply to the new situation. In this case it could be beneficial to model the situation in order to find out how the reaction forces and muscle activities differ from the first situation, where the recommendations were based on empirical data. A combination of risk factors can be derived from the model output. For example, when designing an office chair, one would like to design it to fulfill several demands; comfortable, relaxing, supporting and so on. Some of the criteria related to the demands might be conflicting for example; comfort is often related to the shear force on the seat, which should be kept as low as possible. The seat shear force could be removed by making a <b>horizontal</b> <b>seat</b> and rising the backrest to 90 degrees however this would not be relaxing. Therefore, a combination of seat and backrest angles needs to be considered in order to find optimal seated postures related to only the two design variables. Computer-aided ergonomics is an interdisciplinary field of work, that involve the use of a computer to solve complex problems that involve a person interacting with an environment. As the title reveals, it is all about having a computer to help finding the best ergonomic solution. Ergonomics involves many disciplines, such as biomechanics, anthropometry, mechanical engineering, industrial engineering, kinesiology, health sciences and physiology. Due to the highly interdisciplinary it is hard to get a full understanding of a situation based on knowledge, unless the knowledge in some way is built into a computer system.|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Postural {{control is}} {{important}} for daily activities like reaching and sitting. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) form {{the largest group of}} children with disturbances in postural control. Two levels can be distinguished in postural control: 1) a basic level of direction-specificity, meaning that perturbations inducing a forward sway of the body are accompanied by primary muscle activity on the dorsal side of the body and vice versa and 2) fine-tuning of the direction-specific activity on the basis of afferent input. This pilot study explores the influence of different sitting positions on the stability of the head in space, the kinematic quality of reaching and EMG-parameters of postural control in school-aged children with CP. Methods: Four children aged 8 - 12 years, GMFCS level I-II with unilateral or bilateral spastic CP participated in the study. They were assessed during reaching in four different sitting positions: <b>horizontal</b> <b>seat</b> surface with and without foot support and tilted forward 15 ° with and without foot support. Postural control was measured using surface EMGs of arm, neck, trunk and leg muscles. Movements were recorded kinematically using the SIMI Motion System. Data analysis was carried out with the PedEMG program and the SIMI Motion 3 D program. Data were interpreted by ‘eye balling’ graphs of the effect of sitting condition of the individual children. Results: Overall, posture and reaching of the children with CP was characterized by variation. The data suggested that in the conditions without foot support a forward tilted seat surface in comparison to the horizontal situation was associated with a better quality of reaching and an inconsistent effect on head stability and postural muscle activity. In the horizontal position addition of foot support seemed to be associated with an inconsistent effect on head stability, but a better quality of reaching, and better postural muscle activity. However, foot support in the forward tilted condition seemed not to be associated with improved head stability, reaching and posture. Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study indicate that in the situation of the absence of foot support forward tilting of the seat surface may be associated with a better quality of reaching without affecting postural control. Also the addition of foot support in the horizontal position may {{have a positive effect on}} the quality of reaching without a consistent positive effect on posture. A similar positive effect of foot support seemed absent in the forward tilted position. Further research with larger groups is needed for scientific evidence on the effect of the various sitting conditions on reaching and posture of children with CP. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} the influence of pitch body tilt on judging the possibility of passing under high obstacles {{in the presence of}} an illusory <b>horizontal</b> self-motion. <b>Seated</b> subjects tilted at various body orientations were asked to estimate the possibility of passing under a projected bar (i. e., a parking barrier), while imagining a forward whole-body displacement normal to gravity. This task was performed under two visual conditions, providing either no visual surroundings or a translational horizontal optic flow that stopped just before the barrier appeared. The results showed a main overestimation of the possibility of passing under the bar in both cases and most importantly revealed a strong influence of body orientation despite the visual specification of horizontal self-motion by optic flow (i. e., both visual conditions yielded a comparable body tilt effect). Specifically, the subjective passability was proportionally deviated towards the body tilt by 46 % of its magnitude when facing a horizontal optic flow and 43 % without visual surroundings. This suggests that the egocentric attraction exerted by body tilt when referring the subjective passability to horizontal self-motion still persists even when anchoring horizontally related visual cues are displayed. These findings are discussed in terms of interaction between spatial references. The link between the reliability of available sensory inputs and the weight attributed to each reference is also addressed...|$|R
40|$|Fatalities and {{injuries}} to car occupants in motor vehicle crashes {{continue to be}} a serious global socio-economic issue. Advanced safety systems that provide improved occupant protection and crash mitigation have the potential to reduce this burden. For the development and virtual assessment of these systems, numerical human body models (HBMs) that predict occupant responses have been developed. Currently, {{there is a need for}} increasing the level of biofidelity in these models to facilitate simulation of occupant responses influenced by muscle contraction, such as often experienced during pre-crash vehicle manoeuvres. The aim of this thesis was to provide data and modelling approaches for the advancement of HBMs capable of simulating occupant responses in a wide range of pre-crash scenarios. Volunteer experiments were conducted to study driver and passenger responses during emergency braking with a standard seatbelt and with a seatbelt equipped with a reversible pre-tensioner. Muscle activity, kinematic, and boundary condition data were collected. The data showed that pre-tensioning the seatbelt prior to braking influenced the muscular and kinematic responses of occupants. Drivers modified their responses during voluntary braking, resulting in different kinematics than were observed during autonomous braking. Passenger and driver responses also differed during autonomous braking. The findings demonstrate that HBMs need to account for the differences in postural responses between occupant roles as well as the adjustments made by drivers during voluntary braking. The studies provide detailed data sets that can be used for model tuning and validation. The modelling efforts of this work focused on simulation of head-neck responses. To facilitate the modelling of neck muscle recruitment, muscle activity data from volunteers exposed to multi-directional <b>horizontal</b> <b>seated</b> perturbations were analysed. The derived spatial tuning curves revealed muscle- and direction-specific recruitment patterns. The experimental tuning curves can be used as input to models or to verify spatial tuning of muscle recruitment in HBMs. A method for simulating muscle recruitment of individual neck muscles was developed. The approach included a combination of head kinematics and muscle length feedback to generate muscle specific activation levels. The experimental tuning curves were used to define appropriate sets of muscle activation in response to head kinematics feedback. The predicted spatial tuning using the two feedback loops was verified in multi-directional horizontal gravity simulations. The results showed that muscle activation generated by individual or combined feedback loops influenced the predicted head and intervertebral kinematics. The developed method has the potential to improve prediction of omnidirectional head and neck responses with HBMs. However, further work is needed to verify these findings. Overall, this research has increased knowledge about the muscle responses of occupants in dynamic events typical of pre-crash scenarios. The findings highlight important aspects that must be considered to enable active HBMs to capture a wide range of occupant responses. The data presented support the advancement of current and future HBMs, which will contribute to the development of improved safety systems that reduce the number of fatalities {{and injuries}} in motor vehicle crashes...|$|R

25|$|A {{total of}} 890 Meteors {{were lost in}} RAF service (145 of these crashes {{occurring}} in 1953 alone), resulting {{in the deaths of}} 450 pilots. Contributory factors in the number of crashes were the poor brakes, failure of the landing gear, the high fuel consumption and consequent short flight endurance (less than one hour), causing pilots to run out of fuel, and difficult handling with one engine out due to the widely set engines. The casualty rate was exacerbated by the lack of ejection seats in early series Meteors; the ground-breaking high speed that the aircraft was capable of meant that, during the bailing out process, pilots were typically subject to high g forces hindering movement and the effect of slipstream winds; there was also a greater likelihood of the pilot striking the <b>horizontal</b> tailplane. Ejection <b>seats</b> would be fitted in the later F.8, FR.9, PR.10 and some experimental Meteors.

Oligounitary MSNA was recorded via tungsten microelectrodes inserted into the common peroneal nerve in 12 subjects, laying supine on a motorised platform with the head aligned with the longitudinal axis of the body. Slow sinusoidal linear accelerations-decelerations (peak acceleration ± 4 mG) were applied in the rostrocaudal axis (which predominantly stimulates the saccule) and in the mediolateral axis (which engages the utricle) at 0. 08 Hz. The modulation of MSNA in the rostrocaudal axis (29. 4 ± 3. 4 %) was similar to that in the mediolateral axis (32. 0 ± 3. 9 %), and comparable to that obtained by stimulation of the utricle alone in seated subjects with the head vertical.

The first study, Paper A, focus on the prediction of vibration discomfort based on r. m. s. -values in z-direction of seat. In the case of individual results, the correlation coefficient was 0. 54. Based on averages for each test condition, the correlation coefficient was 0. 93. Study in Paper B focus on the prediction of vibration discomfort and perceived motions. By analysis of vibration values in one-third octave bands of x-direction {{in the top of the}} seat backrest, pitch motion and vertical motions in seat, pitch alone with variable length was found to give best correlation with the vector sum of perceived motions (r= 0. 677). Surprisingly, one-third-octave band higher than 50 Hz give a high contribution to the prediction of perceived motions. One of the background variables, "Length of driver", was found to have a statistically significant effect on perceived motions. Tall driver perceived less motion than short drivers.

Therefore the aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the feasibility and preliminary efficacy of brief motivational interviewing (MI) plus 12 -weeks exercise training as a treatment for MDD in youth. Methods: Youth (15 - 25 years) with MDD were recruited to participate in a prospective trial investigating exercise as treatment for MDD. Twenty-six participants were screened (telephone then clinical psychology diagnosis) and 13 (9 females) were eligible (MDD from SCID, no psychotic illness, not pregnant, no physical barriers to exercise, not suicidal, no major eating disorder) to participate. Participants completed assessments at baseline and after 12 weeks training, which included questionnaires: the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II); blood samples for analysis of inflammatory biomarkers; and fitness measures: VO 2 max, YMCA bench press test, and a <b>seated</b> <b>horizontal</b> leg press endurance test.

40|$|The {{attenuation}} of seismic waves {{is strongly}} influenced by temperature and rheological changes, and so provides an important supplement to information from seismic wavespeeds. Differential attenuation measurements are made for seismic waves refracted through the mantle beneath the Australasian region and are then used to construct 3 D images of the attenuation of shear and compressional waves. The differential attenuation between different seismic phases is estimated using a spectral ratio method in the frequency band 0. 25 – 1. 0 Hz using a multi-taper method. Over this band the attenuation is nearly independent of frequency so that the logarithmic spectral ratio is a linear function of frequency. Differential measurements are made either between P and S phases on the same record or between stations for P and S waves separately. Images of seismic attenuation for the Australasian region are produced using a tomographic inversion, with the fast marching method employed to trace ray paths in an initial 3 -D model derived from surface wave tomography. There is a deep <b>seated</b> <b>horizontal</b> contrast between central Australia and the eastern seaboard. The crustal and lithospheric mantle beneath the Archean and Proterozoic rocks {{in the west and}} in the middle of the continent have low seismic attenuation, whereas the Phanerozoic material in the east is more attenuative. Regions with recent volcanism, most likely associated with hot spots such as near Bass Strait and the Coral Sea, display high seismic attenuation anomalies. There is a strong contrast in attenuation between the relatively low loss lithosphere and the high loss asthenosphere beneath with a change by a factor of 6 – 10.

Human factors are of paramount importance in developing farm machinery given that these machines will often be operated by persons with minimum skills. Therefore, farm machinery should be made simple to operate and as free from hazards as possible. Materials and methods: Firstly, the anthropometric data for 250 users 20 - 60 years old was calculated. The drivers were selected randomly. Then the specifications of 4 tractors including: Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland were compared with the anthropometric data of user in 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. Anthropometric Data of subjects consisted of: standing height, full hand length, popliteal length, seat pan width, seat pan depth, elbow height, seat back support height, hand pan width, hand grip and full-leg length. Getting on the tractor is the first contact of an operator with a tractor. In assessing the suitability of the provision made for getting on the tractor, an experiment was arranged in which operators tried to get on 3 tractors. The mode of getting on the tractors, the agony on the operator’s face, the muscular reactions and individual opinion on the difficulties or comfort while undertaking the task were observed and recorded. The specifications of tractors compared with Anthropometric Data were measured, whiles the tractors were positioned on a level ground for measurements after the tires had been ganged. These specifications were tractor height, steering wheel height, footrest height, foot set height; tractor seat geometry as seat pan width, seat pan depth and seat pan support height; steering geometry as distance of steering wheel from seat reference point, steering wheel radius, steering wheel thickness, steering wheel inclination to the <b>horizontal</b> and <b>seat</b> reach adjustment; levers and pedals distance from seat reference point as gear lever, parking brake lever, hydraulic control lever, clutch pedal, accelerator pedal, brake pedal, front panel, workspace width and workspace length. Results and Discussion: The experiment that was conducted with operators attempting to get on the tractors indicated that tractor steps heights were higher than the desirable limit. Therefore, based on the ideas of the researcher and tractors drivers, getting on all tractors is difficult. With {{an increase in the number}} of steps or a decrease in their heights, the desirable condition can be created. Seat depth of new Holland and Valtra tractors were great for drivers in the 5 th percentile value. A variable thickness pad can solve this problem. Results of studies indicated that Seat depth of Massey Ferguson 285 and 399 was shorter than driver’s leg length of 95 th percentile value. To solve the problem an increase of 10 centimeters to pad height of these tractors was suggested. Seat pad of tractors were short for drivers in the 95 th percentile value. Distance of steering wheel from seat reference point (SRP) in Massey Ferguson 285 and Valtra was further than drivers hand length in the 5 th percentile value. Therefore, the drivers hand is short for driver’s good operation. Surveys indicated that drivers had problems for gear lever access in Massey Ferguson 399. Therefore, for good access on gear lever we must increase seat stroke range by 5 - 10 centimeters. The record available from Meteorological Organization indicated that air temperature and rain throughout the year in the study area is between 20 to 40 degrees Celsius and 100 to 300 mm change. Valtra and New Holland tractors having a driver cabs with heating and cooling equipment have the ideal space for the performance of their driver. Massey Ferguson 285 tractor does not have any driver cab and Roll Over Protection Structure (ROPS). Conclusions: This research was conducted in five provinces of Iran to assess ergonomics of some commonly and new used tractors in Iran containing Ferguson 285, Ferguson 399, Valtra and New Holland. As there was no data base with required details, data was collected directly by personal contact with tractor users. A questionnaire was filled out for each person and anthropometric data was calculated in all provinces for 250 users 20 - 60 year old that were selected at random. Then relevant specifications of 4 tractors were measured and compared with the relevant anthropometric data of users in the 5 th and 95 th percentile value and their adaptation was studied. The results indicated that tractor steps, Seat depth, distance of steering wheel and distance of some levers and pedals from seat reference point should be amended...|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{exposure}} {{can occur}} at work, commuting {{between home and}} work, and in leisure activities. Any form of transportation will expose humans to some degree of vibration. Exposure to vibration can cause health problems, but more likely comfort problems. Health problems are normally related to back pain. Comfort {{on the other hand}} is related to both physiological and psychological factors, which can have a wide range of effects from a general annoyance to a reduced work capability. The standard ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) provides a guidance, which can be used to measure, evaluate and assess effects of whole-body vibration to discomfort. The standard allows several interpretations, which can lead to different results, as the standard does not provide an explicit guidance for selecting which axes and locations to measure and which averaging method to use for evaluating the axes. The suggested averaging method is the root mean square (r. m. s.) method, but additionally vibration dose value (VDV) can be used. This can lead to different results, as VDV emphasises shocks more than the r. m. s. method. The standard guides to measure and evaluate at least the seat translational axes, but the additional nine axes from the seat, backrest and floor are not mandatory. However, this can result in a different comfort value, as the values from the measured axes are combined. So taking into account all possible interpretations the assessment can vary significantly for the same environment. The selection of the averaging method is not a technical issue, as both methods are supported by all commercial equipment. However, it is rare that more than three axes are possible to be measured with typical whole-body vibration measurement equipment, thus the majority of studies have published results based on only the seat translational axes. Especially the rotational axes have been missing in most studies. The full method (i. e. using all possible axes to calculate the comfort value) of ISO 2631 - 1 (1997) has been rarely used and there is very little information on how accurate the method is for assessing discomfort in a multi-axis environment. There are only a few studies that have used the full method, but there are no known studies which have actually validated the full ISO 2631 - 1 method. The objective of the thesis was to validate and, if necessary, to improve the full method of the ISO 2631 - 1 standard for evaluating discomfort from whole-body vibration in a multi-axis environment. It was assumed that the ISO 2631 - 1 method can be used to predict discomfort in practice, but there are a relatively low number of studies to confirm this. Frequency weightings have been the focus of many published studies and it was assumed that these are broadly correct. Other aspects of the ISO 2631 - 1 method are the focus of this thesis. The goal was to keep a backward compatibility to previous studies and the current commercial equipment, thus several limitations were defined for the improvement of the standard. Several laboratory experiments, field measurements, and field and laboratory trials were conducted to validate the standard method. At first it was concluded that practical equipment for measuring 12 -axis data was needed as there was no commercial system available. The equipment and software was validated in two experiments, which showed that simple and affordable components could be used to develop equipment for the full method. Even though the standard does not include information about a six-axis sensor for measuring both translational and rotational axes, there was a method to validate the sensor. The first field study included measuring several machines using all twelve axes. The analysis showed that the seat and backrest translational axes will contribute about 90 % of the overall vibration total value of the standard method, thus very little justification was found for including the seat rotational and floor translational axes. Similar results were found based on the data from the previous 12 -axis studies. It was also found that the neglected axes could be compensated with a factor for estimating the overall vibration total value including all twelve axes. As the overall vibration total value {{is directly related to the}} number of used axes, the compensating factors can be used to compare results which used different axes. The laboratory trial confirmed the results from the field study, and it was concluded that sufficient accuracy to predict discomfort can be achieved using just the seat translational axes, even though the correlation improved when more axes were included. It was found that the evaluation of discomfort was improved by the use of the frequency weighting curves and the r. m. s. averaging method. However, as the multiplying factors degraded correlation, it was concluded that a new set of factors should be calculated. The new factors showed that a higher emphasis on the <b>seat</b> <b>horizontal</b> axes should be given (x= 2. 7, y= 1. 8 and z= 1. 0). The new factors improved the correlation systematically for all subjects. The field trial showed a similar trend, where optimised multiplying factors improved the correlation, but it was also noted that different multiplying factors are required for different environments, thus a procedure to optimise the standard method to different environments was developed. The trial showed systematic behaviour and the optimised multiplying factors were best for all subjects and groups.
