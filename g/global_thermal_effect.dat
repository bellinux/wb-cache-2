40|$|To best {{utilize the}} {{high-throughput}} potential of {{electron beam lithography}} (EBL), miniature electron-beam columns have been developed. Most of these prototypes utilized the conventional Schottky emitter with high operation temperature (~ 1800 K), but thermal issues become the biggest obstacle in its development. To solve this issue, we developed an innovative nanoscale photoemission source, however so far there is no study published about the microcolumn design based on such a source and no work reported on the thermal effect analysis for such a microcolumn. ^ In this study, a new microcolumn is designed so that the source can be incorporated {{with the concept of}} massive parallelism. Based on the several design parameters evaluated, it is possible that such a microcolumn can provide high resolution with a reasonable throughput. To determine the final resolution of the microcolumn, energy distribution in resist is analyzed. Finally, the temperature distributions in resist caused by different beam energies are evaluated for local and <b>global</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>effect.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|The {{molecular}} {{basis of the}} thermal sensitivity of temperature-sensitive channels appears to arise from a specific protein domain rather than integration of <b>global</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>effects.</b> Using systematic chimeric analysis, we show that the N-terminal region that connects ankyrin repeats to the first transmembrane segment is crucial for temperature sensing in heat-activated vanilloid receptor channels. Changing this region both transformed temperature-insensitive isoforms into temperature-sensitive channels and significantly perturbed temperature sensing in temperature-sensitive wild-type channels. Swapping other domains such as the transmembrane core, the C terminus, {{and the rest of}} the N terminus had little effect on the steepness of temperature dependence. Our results support that thermal transient receptor potential channels contain modular thermal sensors that confer the unprecedentedly strong temperature dependence to these channels...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThis paper {{deals with}} the problem of {{oscillating}} flows occurring in devices such as Stirling or thermoacoustic engines and refrigerators. Since the global governing equations cannot be solved, the authors propose to introduce a few simplifications; the most simplifying reduction is that the fluid is assumed to be incompressible. However, specific attention is paid to describing the flow characteristics that's why the Lagrangian formalism which allows the individual study of each fluid particle is adopted. Thereby each particle contribution to <b>global</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> can be evaluated and the gas temperature profiles along the exchanger can be computed. Various situations are presented including the case of a non-uniform temperature at the wall and a phase lag between pressure and temperature at the fluid entrance. The efficiency of the wall to fluid thermal exchange is analyzed. The authors show that this exchange depends upon two important parameters: the geometric ratio between the exchanger length and the particle oscillating displacement, and a thermal parameter ‘‘b'', governing the temperature profiles and related to the Prandtl number, the operating frequency and the phase lag between the instantaneous heat flux and the wall to fluid temperature difference...|$|R
40|$|Macroscopic {{concepts}} {{pertaining to}} the Unruh effect are elaborated and used to clarify its physical manifestations. Based on {{a description of the}} motion of accelerated, spatially extended laboratories in Minkowski space in terms of Poincaré transformations, it is shown that, from a macroscopic perspective, an accelerated observer will not register with his measuring instruments any <b>global</b> <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> of acceleration in the inertial (Minkowskian) vacuum state. As is explained, this result is not in conflict with the well-known fact that microscopic probes respond non-trivially to acceleration if coupled to the vacuum. But this response cannot be interpreted as the effect of some heat bath surrounding the observer. It is also shown that genuine equilibrium states in a uniformly accelerated laboratory cannot be spatially homogeneous. In particular, these states coincide with the homogeneous inertial vacuum at sufficiently large distances from the horizon of the observer and consequently have the same (zero) temperature there. The analysis is carried out in the theory of a free massless scalar field; however the conclusion that the Unruh effect is not of a thermal nature, viz. induced by heat transfer, is generally valid.

40|$|This project {{studied the}} {{characteristics}} of Homogeneous-Charge Compression Ignition (HCCI) combustion near the combustion chamber surfaces using Planar Laser- Induced Fluorescence (PLIF) of the intermediate combustion species formaldehyde. Motivation for this study is a more complete understanding of the thermochemistry associated with HCCI combustion in the thermal boundary layer near the chamber surfaces. Current multi-zone models {{are based on a}} mass distribution defined by predictions of the thermal boundary layers. The engine used for this study was a single-cylinder optically accessible research engine, operating with a compression ratio of 9. 4 : 1, at 600 RPM, with equivalence ratios ranging from 0. 06 to 0. 26 and an intake temperature of 90 �C. Formaldehyde fluorescence was excited by 355 nm light from a pulsed Nd:YAG laser using an innovative through-the-wall approach to avoid vignetting effects. Images were acquired with an intensified CCD camera and post-processing was performed to remove background signal interference. This technique allowed spatial resolution both across the field of view and into the combustion chamber with a resolution of 0. 5 mm at the wall. The data indicate the absence of a strong <b>global</b> <b>thermal</b> stratification <b>effect</b> near the chamber surfaces, with no preferred location for formaldehyde formation or consumption. In all cases, images show a small thermal boundary layer, counter to model predictions.

The technique consists of bullhead injection of polymer solutions (gelant) into the near-wellbore formation without zone isolation. By assuming the low dissolution of polymer in oil and the low mobility of the gel in porous medium, we reduced the compositional model of the process to a simple two-phase model, with RP and capillary pressure (PC) dependent {{on the water and}} gel saturation. We proposed the extension of the LET correlations used to calculate RP and PC for the case of three phases (oil-water-gel). The problem is divided into two stages: the polymer injection and the post-treatment production. Both of these processes are described by the same formal mathematical model, which results from incompressible two-phase flow equations formulated in terms of normalized saturation and <b>global</b> pressure. The <b>thermal</b> <b>effects</b> caused by the injection of a relatively cold aqueous solution are taken into account. The numerical solution shows favorable results for the DPR WSO treatments.
