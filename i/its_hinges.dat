He led his {{opponent}} Marin Čilić by a set but, having been broken to trail 3–4 in the second, was disqualified when he kicked an on-court advertising board bordering a line judge's chair. The board flew off <b>its</b> <b>hinges</b> and struck the judge on the shin, causing a cut and drawing blood. The judge remonstrated with Nalbandian before being taken for treatment. After checking on the injured judge, the umpire disqualified Nalbandian to end the match, causing the crowd to jeer in disappointment.|$|E
25|$|Dark Fall was written, {{designed}} and programmed by Jonathan Boakes, {{who was working}} as a sushi chef at the time. He first got the idea for the game whilst exploring a real abandoned train station and adjoining hotel in Dorset in January 2000. The buildings were sealed shut with corrugated iron, but rusted peepholes allowed him to look inside and determine they had been quite opulent in their day, and had last been used in the late 1940s. Upon further investigation, he discovered one of the doors of the train station was so rotted, the weight of the iron had pulled it partly off <b>its</b> <b>hinges,</b> {{and he was able to}} get inside and explore the buffet room.|$|E

Foulke left his dressing room unclothed and pursued the referee, Tom Kirkham, who took refuge in a broom cupboard. Foulke had to be stopped by a group of F.A. officials from wrenching the cupboard door from <b>its</b> <b>hinges</b> to reach the hapless referee. In the replay, Sheffield United won 2–1, with Foulke being required to make several saves to keep United in the match.

500|$|On 2 March 2006, a beam in {{the roof}} of the debating chamber swung loose from <b>its</b> <b>hinges</b> during a debate, {{resulting}} in the evacuation of the debating chamber and the suspension of parliamentary business. Parliament moved to other premises while the whole roof structure was inspected and remedial works were carried out. The structural engineers, Arup, stated that the problem with the collapsed beam was entirely due to the failure of one bolt and the absence of another. There was no design fault. The engineers concluded, in a report to MSPs, that the damage is likely to have been done during construction work on the chamber roof, in the latter phases of the project. [...] The report also indicated that whilst one of the bolts was missing, the other was broken and had damaged threads commensurate with being overtightened or jammed, which twisted the head off, or came close to doing so.|$|E
500|$|In 1932, Chuck Kocsis (the first golfer {{inducted}} into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor), enrolled at the university. When a promised alumni pledge to pay his expenses fell through, Trueblood agreed to make a loan (at five percent interest) so Kocsis could pay his tuition. The Wolverines with Kocsis won the NCAA championship twice. Kocsis recalled that the team often traveled to tournaments in Trueblood's car. [...] "Professor Trueblood had a seven-passenger Buick," [...] Kocsis said. [...] "He designated me as the chauffeur. So {{if we had a}} golf match, we'd all get into the car and go to Chicago, or go to Ohio, wherever we were going to play." [...] Another teammate recalled the trips in Trueblood's car: [...] "It wasn't a very big Buick, as I recall. [...] We rode with six guys. Chuck used to do most of the driving. I remember that trip down to Washington (for the 1935 national championship at Congressional, which Michigan won). We started in the morning and drove all the way down there. Professor Trueblood was a big guy, too." [...] Trueblood took the team on a side trip to Mount Vernon, where one of the players accidentally bumped the shifter into gear and hit the accelerator as he exited Trueblood's car. The car lurched forward; the open door hit something and was torn off <b>its</b> <b>hinges.</b>|$|E
500|$|Joseph Parkes, Lord Wilton and William Rathbone {{were the}} first to reach Huskisson. They found that a wheel had passed over his right calf and thigh, leaving his knee itself untouched. A flap of skin on his upper leg had been cut back, exposing the muscles, and the exposed arteries had not been severed but were flattened, pulsing with Huskisson's heartbeat. The damaged leg shook uncontrollably. Observers noted that Huskisson {{did not appear to be}} in pain, and instead lay {{watching}} the leg shake. Huskisson shouted [...] "This is the death of me". Parkes attempted to reassure him, but Huskisson replied [...] "Yes, I am dying, call Mrs Huskisson". A man threw his coat over William Huskisson's leg to spare Emily Huskisson from seeing the extent of his injuries, and she was helped from the carriage in which she had been sitting. In hysterics, she attempted to throw herself onto Huskisson, but was restrained by fellow passengers as Lord Wilton applied a makeshift tourniquet he had made using handkerchiefs and an elderly passenger's walking stick. Other passengers ripped the door of a nearby railway storeroom from <b>its</b> <b>hinges,</b> to serve as a makeshift stretcher. Huskisson was lifted onto the door, shaking his head and saying [...] "Where is Mrs Huskisson? I have met my death, God forgive me."

500|$|The tornado {{touched down}} in the Lakeview community, {{initially}} causing structural damage to small buildings and snapping trees. The tornado grew in intensity and the path width increased from around [...] to [...] as it entered the Rainsville and Sylvania communities. Damage included houses that were completely removed from foundations and debris scattered for about , trees were debarked, and a few mobile homes were completely destroyed with debris strewn for about a mile downstream. Aerial surveys also revealed ground scouring in the area. EF5 damage was noted as a pickup truck was thrown hundreds of yards and torn into multiple pieces, and an [...] steel safe anchored to a foundation was torn away, thrown [...] and had its door torn from <b>its</b> <b>hinges.</b> One home in this area was swept away, and a stone pillar was ripped from the ground, thrown, and broken into pieces, with part of a concrete foundation being ripped {{out of the ground}} in the process. Other homes that were swept away were found with their concrete porches torn away and smashed to pieces. An underground storm shelter was partially sucked out of the ground, pavement was stripped from roads, and sidewalk pavement was pulled up at one location. In Sylvania, several other houses were completely removed from foundations, some of which contained anchor bolts and foundation straps. The tornado continued to the south of Ider where significant damage was observed. It crossed into Georgia near Fox Mountain as an EF1 with winds of [...] It tracked [...] into Georgia before lifting outside of Rising Fawn. Damage in Georgia was limited to trees and power lines.

[...] Afterwards, he gave the flag to Ali. [...] According to a Shia tradition, Muhammad called for Ali, who killed a Jewish chieftain with a sword-stroke, which split in two the helmet, the head and the body of the victim. Having lost his shield, Ali is said to have lifted both of the doors of the fortress from <b>its</b> <b>hinges,</b> climbed into the moat and held them up to make a bridge whereby the attackers gained access to the redoubt. The door was so heavy that forty men were required to put it back in place. This story is the basis for the Shi'ites viewing Ali as the prototype of heroes.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the night}} of 2 December 1577, a group of Carmelites opposed to reform broke into John's {{dwelling}} in Ávila and took him prisoner. John had received an order from some of his superiors, opposed to reform, ordering him to leave Ávila and return to his original house, but John had refused {{on the basis that}} his reform work had been approved by the Spanish nuncio, a higher authority than these superiors. The Carmelites therefore took John captive. John was taken from Ávila to the Carmelite monastery in Toledo, at that time the Order's most important monastery in Castile, where perhaps 40 friars lived. John was brought before a court of friars, accused of disobeying the ordinances of Piacenza. Despite John's argument that he had not disobeyed the ordinances, he received a punishment of imprisonment. He was jailed in the monastery, [...] where he was kept under a brutal regimen that included public lashing before the community at least weekly, and severe isolation in a tiny stifling cell measuring ten feet by six feet, barely large enough for his body. Except when rarely permitted an oil lamp, he had to stand on a bench to read his breviary by the light through the hole into the adjoining room. He had no change of clothing and a penitential diet of water, bread and scraps of salt fish. During this imprisonment, he composed a great part of his most famous poem Spiritual Canticle, as well as a few shorter poems. The paper was passed to him by the friar who guarded his cell. He managed to escape nine months later, on 15 August 1578, through a small window in a room adjoining his cell. (He had managed to pry the cell door off <b>its</b> <b>hinges</b> earlier that day.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Several {{attempts}} by Muslims to capture this citadel in some single combats failed. [...] The first {{attempt was made}} by Abu Bakr who took the banner and fought, {{but was unable to}} succeed. [...] Umar, then charged ahead and fought more vigorously than Abu Bakr, but still failed. [...] That night Muhammad proclaimed, [...] "By God, tomorrow I shall give it [...] to a man who loves God and His Messenger, whom God and His Messenger love. Allah will bestow victory upon him." [...] That morning, the Quraysh were wondering who should have the honor to carry the banner, but Muhammad called out for Ali ibn Abi Țalib. [...] All this time, Ali, son-in-law and cousin of Muhammad, was ill and could not participate in the failed attempts. Ali came to Muhammad, who cured him of his ophthalmia, an inhibitive inflammation of the eyes, by spitting in Ali's eye. The apostle sent him with his flag and Ali, with new vigor, set out to meet the enemy, bearing the banner of Muhammad. When he got near the fort the garrison came out and he fought them. During the battle, a Jew struck him so that his shield fell from his hand and Ali lost his shield. In need of a substitute, he picked up a door from the wall and used it to defend himself. The door was said to be so heavy that it took eight men to replace it on <b>its</b> <b>hinges.</b> In some Shi'ite sources it is also said that, when the time came to breach the fortress, he threw the door down as a bridge to allow his army to pass into the citadel and conquer the final threshold. The Apostle revived their (his followers) faith by the example of Ali, on whom he bestowed the surname of [...] "the Lion of God" [...] (Asadullah).|$|E
30|$|When {{using the}} IRF and <b>its</b> <b>hinge</b> system, it may {{sometimes}} become difficult or even impossible {{to place the}} hinges in the desired position, due to the frame construct itself. Even though the construct of the Ilizarov device theoretically may allow for axial corrections in every possible dimension, treatment of multidimensional deformities may practically only partially be possible and mostly affords a step-by-step treatment of all deformities. This may lengthen the procedure, and is prone to lead to further deformities.|$|R
