40|$|This paper {{examines}} the accounting reform of public finances {{from the point}} of view of its impact on the financial statements of local government units, especially applied to the municipalities in the Vysocina region. The reform changed legislative regulations, especially <b>the</b> accounting <b>law,</b> <b>the</b> <b>decree</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>the</b> accounting <b>law</b> and Czech accounting standards for the selected accounting entities. This thesis analyzes the changes in these regulations and it describes the impact of these modifications on the financial statements. These changes create areas that are, due to the reform, new for villages and can be problematic in context of misinterpretations and wrong booking. The areas affected by the reform are divided into three separate areas. The first area is the creation of state accountancy and implementation of accrual based accounting, connected to the state accounting, from which the further accrual principle is derived. The second imaginary area of changes relates to accounting reform in terms of chart of accounts including an off-balance sheet which has considerably changed. The third area is a wide range of assets of an entity, where there was a major change in relation to the accrual principle and that is the beginning of depreciation of all depreciable assets. In connection with depreciation, adjustments are made and the problem area of inventory of property has widened. Changes occurred in valuation of assets, a new way was created and an obligation to revalue assets held for sale was made. Subsequently, the impact of individual problem areas at the municipalities is examined, and so as how the changes will be reflected in their financial statements...|$|R
