40|$|Abstract Blends of poly(lactic acid) (PLA) and {{thermoplastic}} starch (TPS) plasticized with adipate esters (<b>diisodecyl</b> <b>adipate</b> and diethyl adipate) having different {{molecular weight}} {{were used to}} produce sheets. The calendering-extrusion process at a pilot scale was used, and the mechanical, barrier, and morphological characterization of the obtained materials were performed. The increase in the TPS content affected the mechanical properties of the sheets by increasing the elongation and decreasing the rigidity. TPS conferred a more hydrophilic character to the sheets, as observed from the water vapor permeability results. The sheets plasticized with <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DIA), having a higher molecular weight, had better mechanical and barrier properties than diethyl adipate (DEA) plasticized sheets, indicating that DIA was more effective as plasticizer. Micrographs obtained by confocal laser microscopy and scanning electron microscopy showed different morphologies when different proportions of PLA and TPS were used (dispersed or co-continuous structures), which were strongly associated with the mechanical and barrier properties...|$|E
40|$|Siloxane hybrid {{films are}} fragile and have low {{mechanical}} strength due to their vitreous material properties. Hence, a new formulation incorporating a plasticizer agent was developed {{in order to increase}} the layer thickness of a uniform and homogeneous hybrid film on tinplate, and to provide flexibility to the polymeric matrix. Tinplate sheets were coated with a hybrid film obtained from a sol-gel process, constituted by t+he addition of the following alkoxide precursors: 3 -(trimethoxysilyl) propyl methacrylate and tetraethoxysilane with 0. 01 mol L- 1 cerium nitrate addition. The influence of the <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>adipate</b> plasticizer con-centration was evaluated. The films were characterized by scanning electron microscopy, profilometry, open circuit potential monitoring, polarization curves and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. The results showed that all films with <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>adipate</b> had higher electrochemical performance compared to uncoated tinplate. However, the film with the 2 % plasticizer concentrations had the best performance in the electrochemical tests, although it had thinner layer...|$|E
40|$|Phase {{separation}} in plasticized {{cellulose triacetate}} (CTA) films is investigated {{to produce a}} microporous film {{that can be used}} in optical devices. Hot-stretched CTA films containing <b>diisodecyl</b> <b>adipate</b> (DIDA) show negative orientation birefringence similar to the hot-stretched pure CTA. After extracting DIDA from the stretched films by immersion into an organic solvent, however, the films exhibit positive birefringence. Moreover, the magnitude of the birefringence increases with the wavelength, known as extraordinary dispersion, which is an essential property in the preparation of an ideal quarter-wave plate. Numerous ellipsoidal pores with micro-scale were detected in the film after the immersion, indicating that DIDA were segregated and formed ellipsoidal domains in the CTA matrix during annealing and stretching. These results indicate that extraordinary wavelength dispersion is given by the combinations of orientation birefringence from CTA and form birefringence from micropores. Furthermore, it was found that annealing time and stretching condition affect the phase separation as well as the shape and size of pores...|$|E
