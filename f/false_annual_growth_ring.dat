40|$|The age {{structure}} of balsam fir (Abies balsamea (L.) Mill.) regeneration is frequently used to investigate boreal forest dynamics of North America. Tree ages are usually estimated by counting <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> at the shoot-root interface located above {{or close to}} the root system. Inaccurately locating the shoot-root interface could lead to imprecise age determination. In this study, balsam fir seedlings (< 2 m height) were harvested in whole from closed forest stands located {{in the province of}} Quebec, Canada. Seedling age was determined by (i) counting the number of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> at the presumed shoot-root interface, and (ii) counting all terminal bud scars from the apex {{to the base of the}} hypocotyl (true collar). For all seedlings with adventitious roots, the number of terminal bud scars on the entire trunk was higher than the number of <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> at the shoot-root interface. The formation of adventitious roots on the belowground trunk was accompanied by a reverse taper phenomenon, i. e., the number of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> decreased from the presumed shoot-root interface to the true collar. Counting <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> at any level on the trunk of balsam fir seedlings that form adventitious root systems would not be reliable, underestimation's exceeding 20 years are possible and the resulting {{age structure}}s could lead to erroneous interpretations of regeneration dynamics...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{formation}} of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> {{has been confirmed}} for several mangrove species in the last decade, among which is the Rhizophora mangle. However, the record of annual rings for this species was made in a region with high hydric seasonality, a widely recognized induction factor of annual rings in tropical species. In this sense, the present study aimed to verify the occurrence of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in R. mangle in the mangroves of Guaratiba (Rio de Janeiro, Southeastern Brazil), a region with low hydric seasonality. For this purpose, the crossdating technique was applied in ten trees collected with known age (seven years). The <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> are characterized by alternating layers of low vessel density (earlywood) and high vessel density (latewood). Multiple regression analysis indicated that <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> width variation is driven by precipitation, water surplus, water deficit and water storage. Crossdating analysis confirmed the existence of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in the R. mangle in Guaratiba. This discovery in a region with low hydric seasonality increases the dendrocronological potential of this species and suggests the importance of biological factors (eg. phenological behavior) as complementary inductors for the {{formation of}} <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in this species...|$|R
30|$|Dendrochronology uses {{synchronous}} time series of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> widths across a geographical region {{influenced by the}} inter-annual variability of climate and growth limiting factors (e.g., soil moisture). It {{is based on the}} principal of cross-dating, which uses patterns of wide and narrow rings induced by climate variability (Douglass 1941). We cross-dated all cross-sections using standard dendrochronological methods (Stokes and Smiley 1968) and measured <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> widths to the nearest 0.001 mm with a stage micrometer. In cases where cross-sections did not exhibit circuit uniformity we measured them along a radius of intermediate ring width.|$|R

40|$|Annual {{rings are}} not {{commonly}} produced in tropical trees because they grow {{in a relatively}} aseasonal environment. However, in the subalpine zones of Hawaiʻi's highest volcanoes, there is often strong seasonal variability in temperature and rainfall.

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of tree age {{is important for}} understanding tree growth and forest dynamics.

In this paper we assess the occurrence of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> and their utility for age estimation in three tropical tree species, Acrocarpus fraxinifolius, Dalbergia latifolia (Fabaceae) and Syzygium cumini (Myrtaceae), growing in traditional shade coffee plantations of the southern Western Ghats, India. These species previously were described as having "indistinct or absent" <b>growth</b> <b>rings.</b> We used anatomical studies, field measurements and computational methods to characterise <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> and assess similarities between directly and indirectly estimated tree ages. Our study revealed that <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> were characterised by different sets of anatomical features per species and were most distinct in the fast-growing deciduous A. fraxinifolius. Growth rates measured in the field showed annual periodicity in all three species, and reflected annual rainfall-drought cycles in D. latifolia and S. cumini. Direct age estimates were most similar to indirect estimates in D. latifolia, and least so in S. cumini. The results of direct age estimation by counting rings are consistent with them being annual in nature in tropical species with distinct and reliable <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> formation. However, for species with poorly defined <b>growth</b> <b>rings,</b> indirect age estimation methods might be more useful...|$|R

Biodiversitas 17 : 466 - 472. Dendrochronology had long been studied in temperate regions to know tree growth responses to the past climate, and {{to predict the future}} effects of climate change. In the wet tropics, dendrochronology studies were rarely carried out {{because of the lack of}} distinct <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> or wide variation of <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> forms. Our research was aimed to know the variations of width of <b>growth</b> <b>rings,</b> and <b>growth</b> response of young Big-Leaf Mahogany (Swietenia macrophylla) to the past wet climate in Bengkulu, Indonesia. Wood disc specimens of cross sections were collected from seven different mahogany trees from campus forest, University of Bengkulu, and then were dried, sanded, and digitally photographed. <b>Growth</b> <b>rings</b> were measured to the nearest 0. 001 cm with ImageJ software. The annual ring width data were cross-dated visually by synchronizing and aligning the width patterns of all wood specimens.

40|$|AbstractWood {{maintains}} remarkable durability under optimum conditions. However, it erodes {{faster than}} other construction {{materials in the}} circumstances of average usage of civil structures. Therefore, built features made of wood, especially historical features and structures, require repairs and reinforcements more frequently than those made of other materials. Non-destructive testing is usually carried out in structures that are currently in use and is aimed at early detection of failures and taking appropriate remedial measures. It can be generally assumed that diagnostic testing of wood is a difficult process due to its structure. However, the ability to identify the current strength parameters of wooden structural components {{makes it possible to}} properly assess their suitability for further use and design appropriate reinforcement and reconstruction methods. However, {{it should be noted that}} non-destructive test results are influenced by many factors such as: the type of wood, its defects, moisture content, age and the direction of test in relation to <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> as well as microbial agents. This paper addresses the evaluation of the mechanical properties of pine wood under testing perpendicular, vertical and diagonal to the <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings.</b> Furthermore, the paper presents problems related to direction of test content on the results of non-destructive testing (sclerometer, ultrasonic tests and cutting resistance measurements).

30|$|We {{prepared}} and analyzed fire-scarred specimens using dendrochronology techniques (Stokes and Smiley 1968, Arno and Sneck 1977, Orvis and Grissino-Mayer 2002). Samples were air dried and sanded with progressively finer sandpaper until the cellular structure within each <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring,</b> {{and the position}} of fire scars within the ring series, could be viewed clearly under a stereomicroscope with 7 - 45 X magnification (Speer 2010). We identified 373 fire scars in 70 whole or partial cross-sections. Fire scars were identified {{by the presence of}} a gap (often charred) within the ring and subsequent overlapping curvilinear growth characteristic of the tree’s healing pattern (McBride 1983). In addition, we used other fire-associated ring characteristics including traumatic resin ducts, double latewood, and growth releases to confirm the presence of a scar found elsewhere along the circumference of the cross-section (Brown and Swetnam 1994). We approximated the seasonality of fire occurrence by assessing the position of the scar within the <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>ring</b> (Caprio and Swetnam 1995).|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims The {{mangrove}} Rhizophora mucronata {{has previously}} been reported to lack <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings,</b> thus barring it from dendrochronological studies. In this study the reported absence of the <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> was reconsidered and the periodic nature {{of light and dark}} brown layers visible on polished stem discs investigated. In addition, the formation of these layers in relation to prevailing environmental conditions, as well as their potential for age determination of the trees, was studied. Methods Trees of known age were collected and a 2. 5 -year cambial marking experiment was conducted to determine the periodic nature of the visible growth layers. Key Results <b>Annual</b> indistinct <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> were detected in R. mucronata and are defined by a low vessel density earlywood and a high vessel density latewood. The formation of these <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> and their periodic nature was independent from site-specific environmental conditions in two forests along the Kenyan coast. However, the periodic nature of the rings was seriously affected by slow growth rates, allowing accurate age determination only in trees with radial growth rates above 0. 5 mm year(- 1). The onset of the formation of the low vessel density wood coincided with the onset of the long rainy season (April-May) and continues {{until the end of the}} short rainy season (November). The high vessel density wood is formed during the dry season (December-March). Age determination of the largest trees collected in the two studied forests revealed the relatively young age of these trees (+/- 100 years). Conclusions This study reports, for the first time, the presence of <b>annual</b> <b>growth</b> <b>rings</b> in the mangrove R. mucronata, which offers further potential for dendrochronological and silvicultural applications...|$|R
