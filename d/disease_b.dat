40|$|Objectives To {{increase}} {{insight into}} the effect of attention-deficit/ hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) on health in general in older adults. Design Two-phase sampling side-study. Setting Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam (LASA). Participants Two hundred twenty-three randomly selected LASA respondents. Measurements Information was collected during home visits on physical health, medication use, and lifestyle characteristics in Phase 1 and on ADHD diagnosis in Phase 2. The associations between independant variables and ADHD were examined with linear and logistic regression analyses. Results The adjusted regression estimates of the linear regression analysis showed {{that the number of}} ADHD symptoms was positively associated with the presence of chronic nonspecific lung <b>diseases</b> (CNSLD) (<b>B</b> = 2. 58, P =. 02), cardiovascular <b>diseases</b> (<b>B</b> = 2. 18, P =. 02), and number of chronic <b>diseases</b> (<b>B</b> = 0. 69, P =. 04) and negatively associated with self-perceived health (B = - 2. 83, P =. 002). Lifestyle is not a mediator of the association between ADHD and physical health. Conclusion Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in older adults was associated with chronic physical illness and poorer self-perceived health. Contrary to expectations, there were no associations between symptoms of ADHD and lifestyle variables. © 2013, Copyright the Authors Journal compilation © 2013, The American Geriatrics Society...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{assess the}} allelic {{variation}} of the VMD 2 gene in patients with <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> and age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: Three hundred twenty-one AMD patients, 192 ethnically similar control subjects, 39 unrelated probands with familial <b>Best</b> <b>disease,</b> and 57 unrelated probands with the ophthalmoscopic findings of <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> but no family history were screened for sequence variations in the VMD 2 gene by single-strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analysis. Amplimers showing a bandshift were reamplified and sequenced bidirectionally. In addition, the coding regions of the VMD 2 gene were completely sequenced in six probands with familial <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> who showed no SSCP shift. RESULTS: Forty different probable or possible disease-causing mutations were found {{in one or more}} <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> or AMD patients. Twenty-nine of these variations are novel. Of the 39 probands with familial <b>Best</b> <b>disease,</b> mutations were detected in all 39 (33 by SSCP and 6 by DNA sequencing). SSCP screening of the 57 probands with a clinical diagnosis of <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> but no family history revealed 16 with mutations. Mutations were found in 5 of 321 AMD patients (1. 5 %), a fraction that was not significantly greater than in control individuals (0 / 192, 0 %). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with the clinical diagnosis of <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> are significantly {{more likely to have a}} mutation in the VMD 2 gene if they also have a positive family history. These findings suggest that a small fraction of patients with the clinical diagnosis of AMD may actually have a late-onset variant of <b>Best</b> <b>disease,</b> whereas at the same time, a considerable fraction of isolated patients with the ophthalmoscopic features of <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> are probably affected with some other macular disease...|$|R

40|$|Vitelliform macular {{dystrophy}} (<b>Best</b> <b>disease)</b> is an {{autosomal dominant}} macular dystrophy which shares important clinical features with age-related macular degeneration, {{the most common}} cause of legal blindness in the elderly. Unfortunately, our understanding and treatment for this common age-related disorder is limited. Discovery of the gene which causes <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> has the potential to increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of all types of macular degeneration, including the common age-related form. <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> has recently been mapped to chromosome 11 q 13. The photoreceptor-specific protein ROM 1 has also been recently mapped to this location, and the ROM 1 gene is a candidate gene for <b>Best</b> <b>disease.</b> Using highly polymorphic markers, we have narrowed the genetic region which contains the <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> gene to the 10 -cM region between markers D 11 S 871 and PYGM. Marker D 11 S 956 demonstrated no recombinants with <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> in three large families and resulted in a lod score of 18. 2. In addition, a polymorphism within the ROM 1 gene also demonstrated no recombinants and resulted in a lod score of 10. 0 in these same three families. We used a combination of SSCP analysis, denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and DNA sequencing to screen the entire coding region of the ROM 1 gene in 11 different unrelated patients affected with <b>Best</b> <b>disease.</b> No nucleotide changes were found in the coding sequence of any affected patient, indicating that mutations within the coding sequence are unlikely to cause <b>Best</b> <b>disease...</b>|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{estimate}} the prevalence, genotype, and clinical spectrum of Best vitelliform macular dystrophy (<b>Best</b> <b>disease).</b> DESIGN: Retrospective epidemiologic and clinical and molecular genetic observational study. METHODS: SETTING: National referral center. PARTICIPANTS: Forty-five individuals diagnosed with <b>Best</b> <b>disease.</b> OBSERVATION PROCEDURES: Retrospective review of patients diagnosed according to clinical findings and sequencing of BEST 1. Patients with recently established molecular genetic diagnosis were followed up including multifocal electroretinography (mfERG), spectral-domain {{optical coherence tomography}} (SD-OCT), and fundus autofluorescence (FAF) imaging. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: BEST 1 mutations, SD-OCT and FAF findings, mfERG amplitudes, prevalence estimate of <b>Best</b> <b>disease.</b> RESULTS: BEST 1 mutations described previously in Danish patients with <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> are reviewed. In addition, we identified a further 8 families and 1 sporadic case, in whom 6 BEST 1 missense mutations were found, 4 of which are novel. The mutation c. 904 G>T (p. Asp 302 Asn) was identified in members of 4 unrelated families. Structural alterations ranged from precipitate-like alterations {{at the level of}} the photoreceptor outer segments (OS) to choroidal neovascularization. The extent of the former correlated with the reduction of retinal function. A prevalence estimate of <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> in Denmark based on the number of diagnosed cases was 1. 5 per 100 000 individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data expand the mutation spectrum of BEST 1 in patients with <b>Best</b> <b>disease.</b> Alterations of the OS overlying lesions with subretinal fluid are similar to those seen in central serous retinopathy and may indicate impaired turnover of OS. Our frequency estimate confirms that <b>Best</b> <b>disease</b> is one of the most common causes of early macular degeneration. (Am J Ophthalmol 2012; 154 : 403 - 412. (c) 2012 by Elsevier Inc.
