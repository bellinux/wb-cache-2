Full scripts were commissioned on 16 September 1982 with the new title Man-watch, but the scripts were dropped from production for unclear reasons. A second attempt at the story under the title Children of Seth was attempted as a Sixth Doctor story, for which the scripts commissioned on 14 July 1983.

Introduction [...] Re-devising theatre: {{towards a}} {{genealogy}} of <b>devising</b> practice [...] Pre-devising: group formation, development and games [...] <b>Devising</b> theatre: This {{is not an}} exit [...] Conclusion. This non-traditional thesis explores the practical and theoretical processes of group-devised theatre. The research informing this thesis is derived from two interrelated components - a practical project in group <b>devising,</b> and a theoretical study of alternative theatre, <b>devising</b> methodologies, and performance theory. [...] Chapter One defines "devising" before tracing its origins {{through the development of}} experimental practices from the historical avant-garde to the present day. These practices include radical disruptions to discursive language and structure, increased multimedia, reconsiderations of the performer's function and the use of improvisation. This genealogy is argued to be a "literature of practice" capable of informing contemporary <b>devising</b> projects, as well as helping to establish the position of <b>devising</b> within contemporary performance theory. [...] Chapter Two examines how creative collaborators begin to form and function as a <b>devising</b> group, a period I theoretically term "pre-devising". By examining the experiences of my group, gaps in <b>devising</b> literature concerning group formation and composition are identified, complemented by an investigation into the role of theatre games in building ensemble. [...] Chapter Three draws upon the genealogy of <b>devising,</b> <b>devising</b> literature and performance theory to interrogate the process of <b>devising</b> our production, This Is Not An Exit. The theoretical and practical problems of our methods are explored. These methods include organising the group as an artistic democracy, developing naturalistic characters, and establishing a "postmodern aesthetic". By analysing our experiences, this chapter attempts to illustrate the complex tangle of influences informing contemporary performance practitioners, and highlight areas ripe for future critical research.

40|$|Master of EducationThis study {{examines}} how {{a group of}} Melbourne artists collaboratively developed a dramatic film text, entitled WED, over a two-year period. The intentions, ideas, working procedures and outcomes of the project are documented. The research traces the creative journey of this performance work including the initial brainstorming sessions, the two creative development phases, the collaborative stages, the feedback and editorial sessions and the various drafts of the film script. WED is examined as an intrinsic case study. The aim is to investigate the <b>devising</b> processes used {{in the creation of}} an original performance work. The approaches of contemporary professional theatre companies, youth theatre and community practitioners in creating and <b>devising</b> new works are also examined. The study also explores major trends in contemporary <b>devised</b> theatre practice since the 1960 's and investigates the current social, political and cultural contexts for newly <b>devised</b> theatre and film works in Australia. The study investigates the use of discussion, improvisation and the roles of writer and director in the <b>devising</b> process. It raises questions about the nature of collaboration and the authorship. It considers improvisation as a useful tool for <b>devising</b> new work and examines the various stages of collaboration. It asks who is ultimately-responsible for creating the work and writing the text. By addressing these questions the aim is to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} <b>devising</b> process and the craft of theatre making. Qualitative research methods, interviews, participant observation, video documentation and analysis have been used to document the making of WED. The study reveals my participatory researcher role as collaborator, actor and 'privileged observer' throughout the project (Wolcott, 1987). This case study provides insight into how one group of professional artists <b>devised</b> new work and its outcome suggests a model for <b>devising</b> new work collaboratively. This model is relevant for senior drama students undertaking <b>devised</b> drama and those in a range of other settings where new narrative performance texts are created.

This collection takes a historical approach that demonstrates how this contemporary surge of work builds on a physical and dance theatre movement in Irish theatre that began to coalesce in the 1990 s through the work of companies like Barabbas, Macnas, Blue Raincoat, and Pan Pan which was in turn influenced by earlier community arts practice {{on the island of}} Ireland beginning in the late 1970 s. <b>Devised</b> Performance in Irish Theatre makes visible a uniquely Irish body of work that will also further international understandings of <b>devised</b> performance as collaborative process and working methodology...|$|R
