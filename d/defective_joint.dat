50|$|The {{fittings}} are not re-useable. If {{a design}} change is required or if a joint {{is found to}} be defective or improperly crimped, the already installed fittings must be cut out and discarded. In addition, the cutting required to remove the fitting often will leave insufficient tubing to install the new fitting, So couplers and additional tubing will need to be installed {{on either side of the}} replacement fitting. Whereas with a soldered fitting, a <b>defective</b> <b>joint</b> can just be re-soldered, or heated and turned if a minor change is required, or heated and removed without requiring any of the tubing to be cut away. This also allows more expensive fittings like valves to be re-used if they are otherwise in good to new condition, something not possible if the fitting is crimped on.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe tabbing step is a {{critical}} process step in module manufacturing. <b>Defective</b> solder <b>joints</b> lead to an increased series resistance, a lower fill factor and to mechanical stability problems. Out of several image-based methods, such as PL, PL-j 0, EL, ReBEL, RS-EL, LBIC, DLIT and ILIT (all discussed in [1]) we investigate the potential of RS-electroluminescence as a non-destructive method to detect <b>defective</b> solder <b>joints.</b> This series resistance imaging method {{is based on the}} work of Haunschild [2]. The idea is to map the local series resistance of an interconnected solar cell with the help of a high and a low voltage EL-image. The potential of the method is demonstrated on a standard solar cell and on a MWT solar cell. For that matter we produce defined soldered interconnections on solar cells where we vary the parameters soldering force, soldering time and tabbing cell temperature during the tabbing step. The RS-EL method on these samples shows that <b>defective</b> solder <b>joints</b> can be detected and localised so that a spatially resolved quality control of the interconnection process becomes possible...|$|R

Subsequently, this relationship is considered in more detail in both the discount free case and under the compound binomial model. The latter case may be viewed as a discrete analog of the classical Poisson model. Simplifications of the general relationship are obtained, and a connection between the <b>defective</b> <b>joint</b> cumulative distribution functions of the surplus prior to ruin and the deficit at ruin in the stationary and the ordinary renewal risk models is established. Moreover, the defective probability function of the claim causing ruin is derived in the compound binomial case...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of various Gerber-Shiu functions in Sparre Andersen models allowing for possible dependence between claim sizes and interclaim times is examined. The penalty function {{is assumed to}} depend on {{some or all of}} the surplus immediately prior to ruin, the deficit at ruin, the minimum surplus before ruin, and the surplus immediately after the second last claim before ruin. <b>Defective</b> <b>joint</b> and marginal distributions involving these quantities are derived. Many of the properties in the Sparre Andersen model without dependence are seen to hold in the present model as well. A discussion of Lundberg's fundamental equation and the generalized adjustment coefficient is given, and the connection to a defective renewal equation is considered.

In this work {{the development of an}} optical inspection system, for monitoring the manual gas tungsten arc welding (GTAW) process of steel pipes, is described. The arc plasma visible emission produced during the process was acquired and spectroscopically analysed. Measuring the intensities of selected argon emission lines allowed real time calculation and recording of the axial electron temperature of the plasma. Experimental results showed that the temperature signal varies greatly in the case of instabilities of the weld pool that cause weld defects. A suitable algorithm, based on a statistical analysis of the signal, was developed in order to real time flag <b>defective</b> <b>joints.</b> It is shown that several weld defects such as porosity,dropout, lack of fusion, solid inclusions and craters were successfully detected in a production environment. The performances of the optical sensor were compared with the results of state-of-the-art post-weld controls such as x-rays and penetrating dyes, showing good agreement and thus demonstrating the validity of this quality monitoring system...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce the noise of a defect {{electromagnetic}} signal of the steel cord conveyor belt used in coal mines, a new signal noise reduction method by combined use of the improved threshold wavelet and Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD) is proposed. Firstly, the denoising method based on the improved threshold wavelet is applied to reduce the noise of a defect electromagnetic signal obtained by an electromagnetic testing system. Then, the EMD is used to decompose the denoised signal and then the effective Intrinsic Mode Function (IMF) is extracted by the dominant eigenvalue strategy. Finally, the signal reconstruction is carried out by utilizing the obtained IMF. In order to verify the proposed noise reduction method, the experiments are carried out in two cases including the <b>defective</b> <b>joint</b> and steel wire rope break. The experimental results show that the proposed method in this paper obtains the higher Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR) for the defect electromagnetic signal noise reduction of steel cord conveyor belts...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} a compound Poisson risk {{model in which}} part of the premium is paid to the shareholders as dividends when the surplus exceeds a specified threshold level. In this model {{we are interested in}} computing the moments of the total discounted dividends paid until ruin occurs. However, instead of employing the traditional argument, which involves conditioning on the time and amount of the first claim, we provide an alternative probabilistic approach that makes use of the (<b>defective)</b> <b>joint</b> probability density function of the time of ruin and the deficit at ruin in a classical model without a threshold. We arrive at a general formula that allows us to evaluate the moments of the total discounted dividends recursively in terms of the lower-order moments. Assuming the claim size distribution is exponential or, more generally, a finite shape and scale mixture of Erlangs, we are able to solve for all necessary components in the general recursive formula. In addition to determining the optimal threshold level to maximize the expected value of discounted dividends, we also consider finding the optimal threshold level that minimizes the coefficient of variation of discounted dividends. We present several numerical examples that illustrate the effects of the choice of optimality criterion on quantities such as the ruin probability. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

The available methods at our disposal for addressing the limiting factors and operating at a higher energy will then be reviewed: a complete circuit qualification method coined the Thermal Amplifier can define the maximum safe energy of the LHC in case of a quench next to a <b>defective</b> <b>joint.</b> Ways of avoiding magnet quenches, another critical element of the analysis, for instance by optimizing BLM settings will then be shown. Finally, a proposal of a strategy for running at the highest possible energy compatible with a pre-defined level of risk will be presented.

For this purpose the computer model QP 3 has been developed. In this paper the results of some calculations are presented, and it is shown how {{the results have been}} used to improve the quench detection system and ensure safe future operation. First the layout of the 13 kA circuits, the geometry of the soldered joints and the quench detection system will be described. Special focus is put on several types of defects in the joint that have been found in the LHC. The difference between slow and fast thermal run-away will be discussed, focusing on quench propagation and reduced thermal and electrical contacts between the various parts of the joint. It is shown that an enhancement of the LHC quench detection system with a much lower threshold will greatly reduce the risk of burn-out of the joint. Finally it is discussed that protection is not feasible for fast thermal run-aways, and that a reduction of the operating current is needed for safe operation until all <b>defective</b> <b>joints</b> have been repaired...|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the detection and characterization of material loss within lap joints. One of the most commonly used nondestructive methods to inspect lap joints is the eddy current method [1]. In this technique, the percentage of material loss is determined by comparing the signal from the <b>defective</b> <b>joint</b> with a reference signal. Ultrasonic tests based on pulse-echo technique {{can also be used to}} detect thickness reduction in lap joints. However both of these methods require that the sensor be directly above the defects, thus making their practical implementation extremely time consuming. Improving the efficiency of lap joint inspection is one of the most critical tasks currently facing the NDE community. In this paper we discuss the feasibility of using an ultrasonic technique based on guided waves launched across the lap joint. It is well known that the characteristics of guided waves can be used to detect defects in plates [2]. The geometry of the lap joint makes it much more difficult to extend the guided wave based method to lap joints. There is no closed form solution to the problem of wave propagation across lap joints. Due to the change of thickness and the existence of vertical stress free boundaries, nonpropagating modes may play an important role inside and near the overlapped region. With material loss inside the lap joint, the geometry becomes even more complicated. Thus the problem of wave propagation in the lap joint can only be solved by numerical and experimental methods...|$|E

Here we created conditional mouse embryo mutants lacking Ext 1 in developing joints by mating Ext 1 f/f and Gdf 5 -Cre mice. Ext 1 encodes a subunit of the Ext 1 /Ext 2 Golgi-associated protein complex responsible for heparan sulfate (HS) synthesis. The proximal limb joints did form in the Gdf 5 -Cre;Ext 1 f/f mutants, but contained an uneven articulating superficial zone that expressed very low lubricin levels. The underlying cartilaginous epiphysis was deranged as well and displayed random patterns of cell proliferation and matrillin- 1 and collagen IIA expression, indicative of an aberrant phenotypic definition of the epiphysis itself. Digit joints were even more affected, lacked a distinct mesenchymal interzone and were often fused likely as a result of local abnormal BMP and hedgehog activity and signaling. Interestingly, overall growth and lengthening of long bones were also delayed in the mutants. To test whether Ext 1 function is needed for joint formation at other sites, we examined the spine. Indeed, entire intervertebral discs, normally composed by nucleus pulposus surrounded by the annulus fibrosus, were often missing in Gdf 5 -Cre;Ext 1 f/f mice. When disc remnants were present, they displayed aberrant organization and <b>defective</b> <b>joint</b> marker expression. Similar intervertebral joint defects and fusions occurred in Col 2 -Cre;β-cateninf/f mutants. The study provides novel evidence that local Ext 1 expression and HS production are needed to maintain the phenotype and function of joint-forming cells and coordinate local signaling by BMP, hedgehog and Wnt/β-catenin pathways. The data indicate also that defects in joint formation reverberate on, and delay, overall long bone growth...|$|E

Particularly in the field of automatic industry inspection, the machine learning based vision inspection plays a more and more important role in defect identification and feature extraction.
