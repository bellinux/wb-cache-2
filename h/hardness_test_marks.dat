40|$|Abstract. The aim of {{the paper}} is to present {{developed}} methodology for evaluation of mechanical properties using nondestructive (NDT) methods. The final methodology will focus on evaluating the mechanical properties of the heterogeneous weld structure. The mechanical properties are determined by conducting NDT instrumented Vickers <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> The developed methodology for the basic mechanical properties determining {{is based on the}} inverse FEM modeling of instrumented <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and the indentation curve and the measured surface imprint are the output of indentation. The outputs from the experimental <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> (the corresponding values from indentation curve and measured surface) are not always corresponding. These differences affect the accuracy of the developed methodology, because it is achieved of the basic material mechanical properties by comparing the outputs of the experimental instrumented <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and modeled <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> using FEM...|$|R

50|$|The Meyer <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> is a {{rarely used}} <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> based upon {{projected}} area of an impression. This {{is a more}} fundamental measurement of hardness than other <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> {{which are based on}} the surface area of an indentation. The principle behind the test is that the mean pressure required to test the material is the measurement of the hardness of the material. The mean pressure is calculated by dividing the load by the projected area of the indentation. The result is called the Meyer hardness, which has units of megapascals (MPa).|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{sources of}} {{problems}} with a <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machine that are detectable via day-to-day inspection using hardness standard blocks, or indirect verification, can be roughly divided into three: the indenter, the test force, and the indentation measuring apparatus. If any problems are detected, repair or recalibration of the testing machine, focusing on the aforementioned three factors, is carried out {{based on the results}} of verifying the direct accuracies of that machine. These efforts have been accumulated to acquire the high level of <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> technology as is available now. This article describes the development of a hardness standard block as a tool for indirect verification of <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> machines, discusses possible factors that have effects on hardness measurements, and provides insights into the future <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> from a perspective of a hardness block manufacturer...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hardness</b> <b>test</b> {{results provide}} a {{convenient}} and economical means of specifying material performance characteristics and {{are useful in}} quality control. Quantifiable <b>hardness</b> <b>testing</b> is at least 150 years old but, due to the complex deformation processes that occur during indentation, in many ways physical insights onthe test are still lacking. Finite element cedes can now accurately simulate complex, time-varying stress and strain states. Such codes {{can be used as}} a tool to study the <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> and with the knowledge gained perhaps make such testing more useful for validating the material models used for impact simulations. In this paper the EPIC finite element code with the Johnson-Cook strength model was used to numerically simulate-Brinell, and Rockwell B, C, and F <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> (as appropriate) for 24 different metals...|$|R

50|$|An {{advantage}} of the Meyer test {{is that it is}} less sensitive to the applied load, especially compared to the Brinell <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> For cold worked materials the Meyer hardness is relatively constant and independent of load, whereas for the Brinell <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> it decreases with higher loads. For annealed materials the Meyer hardness increases continuously with load due to strain hardening.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} thesis {{deals with}} {{determination of the}} mechanical properties of weld materials based on instrumented <b>hardness</b> <b>test.</b> This work {{was caused by the}} research project between IAM Brno Ltd and CEZ corp., when the task was to develop a methodology for evaluation of mechanical material properties using NDT methods. For these reasons the development of methodology is reflected especially for use in practice focusing to determining the mechanical properties of the heterogeneous weld joint on the assembled equipment. The mechanical material properties are determined by carrying out non-destructive tests of the instrumented Vickers hardness. The developed methodology for determining of basic mechanical properties is based on the principle of inverse FEM modeling of the instrumented <b>hardness</b> <b>tests,</b> when output of the testing is indentation curve and measured surface imprint after unloading. The basic material mechanical properties are achieved by comparing the outputs of the experimental instrumented <b>hardness</b> <b>tests</b> and the outputs of the modeled <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> using FEM...|$|R

50|$|Proposed by Swedish {{engineer}} Johan August Brinell in 1900, it was {{the first}} widely used and standardised <b>hardness</b> <b>test</b> in engineering and metallurgy. The large size of indentation and possible damage to test-piece limits its usefulness.

This feature contributed to its early adoption over competing <b>hardness</b> <b>tests.</b>|$|R
