2500|$|Many {{reasons for}} the {{evolutionary}} adaptation of traumatic insemination as a mating strategy have been suggested. One is that traumatic insemination is an adaptation {{to the development of}} the mating plug, a reproductive mechanism used by many species. Once a male finishes copulating, he injects a glutinous secretion into the female's reproductive tract, thereby [...] "literally glu her genital tract closed". Traumatic insemination allows subsequent males to bypass the <b>female's</b> <b>plugged</b> genital tract, and inject sperm directly into her circulatory system.|$|R

50|$|On the <b>female</b> <b>plug,</b> {{the outer}} body is {{metallic}} and cylindrical in shape, and comprises {{one of the}} two contacts. The second, inside contact is a hollow metallic cylinder constructed to accept insertion of the pin in the corresponding male connector. The inner and outer barrels are separated by an insulating layer. The outer contact is generally called the barrel, sleeve or ring, and the inner contact is called the tip.|$|E
50|$|In this example, the {{marginal}} {{reliability of the}} connector choice was deemed to be acceptable by the equipment designer, since the power adapter supplies low voltage that does not pose an electric shock hazard. The potential fire hazard from accidental short-circuiting is addressed by the internal safety fuse, although this requires that a failed power adapter must be completely replaced. In a different design, if the power adapter were intended to supply a voltage sufficient to cause electrical shock, the semi-exposed center contact of the <b>female</b> <b>plug</b> would be considered unacceptably hazardous, requiring a different choice of power connector.|$|E
50|$|As an illustrative {{example of}} some design {{tradeoffs}} in power connector selection, consider the adjacent picture.

Although the plug is female, with a partially recessed center contact, it is still possible for casual accidental contact with a metallic object to short-circuit the power source. Depending on the design of the power adapter, it may react to a short circuit by shutting down temporarily, or instead by blowing out an internal safety fuse.|$|E

50|$|Male mammals {{can compete}} for harems {{as well with}} {{elephant}} seals competing fiercely for harems. As mammals reach sexual maturity, secondary sexual characteristic arise. Elephant seals have a proboscis in the adult male, {{which is used to}} project loud noises, frequently heard during the mating season. Elephant seals with a bigger proboscis emit lower sounds than males with a smaller proboscis and are the bigger of the males in a colony.Mate-guarding {{is an important factor in}} male-male competition to ensure fertilization of an offspring, and, when successful, helps to overlook and court the female. It especially prevents sperm competition from occurring as it ensures reproductive success. This process can be engaged when a post-coital signal is sent to a male to keep guard by the <b>female.</b> Mating <b>plugs</b> are a form of mate-guarding that have proved to show precopulatory <b>female</b> choice.

5000|$|As an {{additional}} complication, certain electronic connector designs may incorporate combinations {{of male and}} female pins in a single connector body, for mating with a complementary connector with opposite gender pins in corresponding positions. In these unusual cases, gender is often defined by the shape of the connector body, rather than the mixed-gender connector pins and sockets. These types of connectors are not strictly speaking hermaphroditic, since mating connectors are not freely interchangeable. An informal term that has been used for these connectors is [...] "bisexual", in addition to the more official terminology, mixed-gender. Thus, for example, one can have a mixed-gender <b>female</b> <b>plug</b> that connects to a mixed-gender male jack (though a reversed gender assignment of connectors would be a more typical design choice in this example).|$|E

Serial SCSI added another three transport types, each with one or more connector types.

An alternative hypothesis invokes sexual selection and makes the opposite prediction namely that sexual cannibalism is an expression of female choice and should hence mainly target males of low quality.

40|$|Background: Mating plugs {{that males}} place onto the female genital tract are {{generally}} assumed to prevent remating with other males. Mating plugs are usually explained {{as a consequence}} of male-male competition in multiply mating species. Here, we investigated whether mating plugs also have collateral effects on female fitness. These effects are negative when <b>plugging</b> reduces <b>female</b> mating rate below an optimum. However, plugging may also be positive when plugging prevents excessive forced mating and keeps mating rate closer to a females’ optimum. Here, we studied these consequences in the gonochoristic nematode Caenorhabditis remanei. We employed a new CO 2 -sedation technique to interrupt matings before or after the production of a plug. We then measured mating rate, attractiveness and offspring number. Results: The presence of a mating plug did not affect mating rate or attractiveness to roving males. Instead, <b>females</b> with mating <b>plugs</b> produced more offspring than <b>females</b> without copulatory <b>plugs.</b> Conclusions: Our experiment suggests that plugging might have evolved under male-male competition but represents a poor protection against competing males in our experiment.

Certain males are able to [...] "plug" [...] the female after they have mated with her to prevent other males from copulating with the <b>female.</b> This <b>plugging</b> involves using the entire male's body, thus allowing him to only mate once. This is a major reason as to why these males are always in a rush to mate after the female has completed her final moult. With males always waiting around for the female to reach full maturity, the race is on for the male who is small enough to not be detected, yet is also able to [...] "plug" [...] the female so that no other male can compete for fertilization of her eggs. These spiders have evolved to become monogamous for the most part after mating because of this damage. If the females are only able to reproduce once they must develop method to produce more offspring at one time (per clutch). This can be caused by multiple things, including a sex ratio that forces these males to make sure they have at least one female to produce their offspring simply because there are not as many females present. If these females are only able to mate one time, they need to develop this larger clutch size to ensure that their genes are passed down from the surviving of her first clutch.|$|R
40|$|Male genital {{mutilation}} {{is a common}} mechanism by which males reduce sperm competition by <b>plugging</b> <b>female</b> insemination ducts with different parts of its own genital system. This behavior is frequent in many spider families but is uncommon in Haplogynae. The reproductive biology of Dysderoidea is not well studied and the data is fragmentary; male {{genital mutilation}} has been reported only for one species of Oonopidae.

The similarity of the female genitalia of U. catleyi to those of Orsolobidae, along with sclerotization of the seminal duct in the male copulatory bulb that is also present in Orchestina, Xiombarg, and Orsolobidae, provide strong evidence of the basal position of this genus in the family Oonopidae...|$|R

40|$|We {{document}} a case {{in which}} the mating plug of the scorpion Vaejovis punctatus seems correlated with a reduction in female sexual receptivity. We used two morphological and behavioral analyses. The mating plug was dissected and described from both males and females: it bears a set of spines and two enlarged terminations which possibly allow anchoring to the female inside and impede removal. Behavioral observations support this view: after sperm transfer ended, the female tried to remove the plug by rubbing the ventral side of her body using her second and third pair of legs. This pattern was also performed after mate separation. All females seemed unable to displace the plug and rejected male mating attempts. The mating plug suffered a progressive degradation into the female. This degradation was completed 2 or 3 mo prior to parturition, so that the plug did not seem a barrier for the emergence of embryos. Furthermore, <b>females</b> bearing mating <b>plugs</b> in different degradation stages did not accept another mating during the reproductive season, and sexual acceptance was reinitiated only after parturition. The mating plug therefore seems to correlate with a lost in mating activity. The comparison of this structure with that of other scorpion species allows us to hypothesize a sexual coevolutionary scenario in which the effectiveness of the <b>plug</b> to inhibit <b>female</b> remating may lie at the center of such interaction...|$|R
40|$|Mating <b>plugs</b> {{occluding}} the <b>female</b> gonopore after mating are {{a widespread}} phenomenon. In scorpions, two main types of mating plugs are found: sclerotized mating plugs being {{parts of the}} spermatophore that break off during mating, and gel-like mating plugs being gelatinous fluids that harden in the female genital tract. In this study, the gel-like mating plug of Euscorpius italicus was investigated with respect to its composition, fine structure, and changes over time. Sperm forms the major component of the mating plug, a phenomenon previously unknown in arachnids. Three parts of the mating plug can be distinguished. The part facing {{the outside of the}} female (outer part) contains sperm packages containing inactive spermatozoa. In this state, sperm is transferred. In the median part, the sperm packages get uncoiled to single spermatozoa. In the inner part, free sperm is embedded in a large amount of secretions. Fresh mating plugs are soft gelatinous, later they harden from outside toward inside. This process is completed after 3 - 5 days. Sperm from artificially triggered spermatophores could be activated by immersion in insect Ringer's solution indicating that the fluid condition in the females' genital tract or females' secretions causes sperm activation. Because of the male origin of the mating plug, it has likely evolved under sperm competition or sexual conflict.

This study aimed to evaluate the effects of acute exposure of female mice to halothane, isoflurane, and sevoflurane prior to mating. BALB/c female mice (n= 160) were allocated in groups of 20 to halothane (HG), isoflurane (IG), sevoflurane (SG), and oxygen/sham (SH) treatment groups and their respective control groups (CGs). The mice were exposed to 1 minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of the corresponding anaesthetic or oxygen for 4 h/day over 5 consecutive days. Two days after exposure, females were mated with males (ratio 2 : 1 female/male) for five consecutive days. Every morning, females were checked for the presence of vaginal plugs. Half of the <b>females</b> that exhibited <b>plugs</b> were euthanised 72 h later for embryo evaluation. The remaining females were euthanised on the 14 th day of pregnancy for foetal evaluation. A low number of morulae and total embryos (morulae + blastocysts) were observed in the HG (P< 0. 05). The number of implantations was lower in the HG (6. 0) compared with the IG (11. 8) and SG (12. 4) (P< 0. 05). Exposure to halothane is not recommended for use in female mice prior to mating procedures because it leads to decreased embryo production and pregnancy failure. Sevoflurane induces a delay in embryo development, thereby influencing the morulae to blastocyst ratio. Isoflurane is the safest of the tested anaesthetics for use in female mice prior to mating. ...|$|R

40|$|The present paper gathers {{the results}} of a {{morphological}} study on 149 specimens of Rhinolophus hipposideros, and of ecological investigations on additional material, incl. some 5, 000 banded individuals of the same species. Brief description of the reproductive organs of both sexes is given. The reproductive organs of the sexually mature (adult) and the sexually immature grown-up (subadult) individuals are illustrated and comments are made on their changes during the year. In adult males, the spermatogenesis commences in spring, after the change from winter torpidity to active life, and culminates towards the end of July and in August. During the winter months (December to April), the seminiferous epithelium of the tubules of testes is resting. On the contrary, the interstitial cells of Leydig are conspicuously developed in the period from October to April (or May). The tubules of the epididymides of adult males are never entirely free of spermatozoa but they contain the lowest numbers of the latter at the period of intensive spermatogenesis. Towards the end of August and in September, the tubules of the cauda epididymidis begin to be filled with greater numbers of spermatozoa, being overcrowded with them in the period from October till April. Apart from the ampullar glands, the seminal vesicles, the prostate and the bulbourethral or Cowper’s glands, the males of R. h. possess a conspicuously developed accessory sexual gland, discovered, in Rhinolophus, by ROBIN (1881 b) and termed the glandula urethralis. This gland is the greatest element of the male genital tract, being at the peak of its secretory activity in October and November. The staining properties of the secretion of this gland indicate that the urethral gland takes an important part in the origin of the <b>female</b> vaginal <b>plug.</b> Most of the adult females were found to copulate already in autumn, from late September till November. Ovulation takes place in April, still before the dissipation of the vaginal plug. Pregnancy lasts for about 2 ½ months; lactation, for 4 to 5 weeks. The main information on the course of estrous cycle was obtained by histological examinations of vaginal epithelium. The following is the succession of the individual phases of the estrous cycle of reproducing female R. h. in Czechoslovakia: proestrus, late August and early September; estrus, late September till early April; pregnancy, late April till first days of July; lactation, July and early August. The life of R. h. can be divided into three main periods, viz., the juvenile, subadult and adult period. The juvenile period lasts {{about two and a half}} months, from July till September. The pelage of individuals younger than some 14 months of age is grey, that of older ones being greyish brown to brown in colour. The male R. h. attain sexual maturity at an approximative age of one year and are first capable of fertilizing at the age of about 15 months, in the second autumn of their life. While the first signs of estrus appear in female R. h. already at the age of 4 months, most of them attain sexual maturity only towards the end of the second year of their life. A small percentage of females (15 %, according to banding results) reproduce already at the end of the first year of their life. Although the uterus of one pregnant female R. h. was found to contain two embryos, our results indicate that the litter size equals one. The greatest longevity of R. h. in Czechoslovakia, determined by banding, is 10 ½ years for males and 9 ½ years for females. A certain percentage of adult females (6. 7 % of the material examined) do not reproduce. Sex ratio among the juveniles is 1 : 1 while males predominate among the subadults and, especially, adults; however, a question arises of the extent in which the sample obtained corresponds to the actual relations in the population. The paper is concluded by a discussion. The main problems arising from the study are discussed, viz., the possible hormonal regulation of the male sexual activity, the estrous condition of females, especially during hibernation (the so-called “subestrus”), and the time of attaining sexual maturity...|$|R

However, {{the structure of the}} xylophagous food web remains unclear for saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps, but fungi are believed to play an important role, both in direct and indirect nutritional acquisition and production of volatile chemicals. In the first study of its kind this thesis explores the importance of volatiles in host-searching behaviour and role of fungi in oviposition choice and larval nutrition, using three endophytic fungi, Stereum hirsutum, Stereum gausapatum and Eutypa spinosa, and two tree species Fagus sylvatica and Quercus robur, in early stage decay. Newly designed traps, excluding wood visual stimuli, provided the first evidence of wood-fungal volatile attraction by saproxylic wood-boring beetles, including primary and secondary xylophages, and their parasitoid wasps. Expanding on these results, the importance of fungi was further demonstrated through oviposition choice in field logs by two polyphagous cerambycid species. Ovipositing within or 20 mm from their preferred fungal species <b>plug,</b> <b>females</b> chose abiotic conditions suitable for sustaining fungal growth, suggesting a larval nutritional benefit. Further investigation, using one of the cerambycid species above, corroborated, via olfactometry, that volatiles from the preferred wood-fungal combination were attractants to gravid females, and induced ovipositor probing within the olfactometer. In addition, GC-EAG found six volatile compounds provoked an antennal response, including a monoterpene, two sesquiterpenes, an alkane and a ketone. Most importantly olfactometry and GC-EAG showed gravid females were unresponsive to wood or favored fungus presented singly. The result are discussed herein. In conjunction with the volatile only field trap experiment, a novel method to promote fungal only volatiles, by autoclaving the wood prior to sub-culturing, was trialed. GC-MS comparative analysis showed disparity between agar sub-cultured, autoclaved wood and natural wood with fungi, volatiles. This suggests that genes encoding cellulases and hemicellulases are regulated according to carbohydrate source, nutritional availability, oxygen and metal ions, supporting the variations observed. These results are discussed herein with regard to xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps. The principal findings of this thesis are that wood-fungal interaction volatiles of the ephemeral early decay stage provide important olfactory host resource cues for saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid wasps. Fungi, and particular, endophytic fungi, were shown to be a key component of the early stage xylophagous food web through volatile production, and as nutritional support evidenced by oviposition choice, olfactometry, GC-EAG and GC-MS analysis. This thesis has opened a new, exciting and important area of research with the potential to radically improve conservation management and employ a more holistic approach. These insights bring together the disparate research conducted individually on wood decay fungi, saproxylic xylophagous beetles and their parasitoid waspsImperial Users onl...|$|R
40|$|Women {{are advised}} not to attempt {{pregnancy}} while on hydroxyurea (HU) {{due to the}} teratogenic effects of this agent, based on results obtained from animal studies. Several case reports suggest that HU may have minimal or no teratogenic effects on the developing human fetus. Fourteen cases of HU therapy in pregnant patients diagnosed with acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia, primary thrombocythemia, or sickle cell disease (SCD) have been reported. Three pregnancies were terminated by elective abortion; 1 woman developed eclampsia and delivered a phenotypically normal stillborn infant. All other patients delivered live, healthy infants without congenital anomalies. We contend that case studies such as these have too few patients and cannot effectively address the adverse effect of HU on preimplantation embryo or fetuses. The objective {{of this study was}} to assess the risks associated with a clinically relevant dose of HU used for the treatment of SCD, on ovulation rate and embryo development, using adult C 57 BL/ 6 J female mice as a model. In Experiment 1, adult female mice were randomly assigned to a treatment or a control group (N = 20 /group). Treatment consisted of oral HU (30 mg/kg) for 28 days; while control mice received saline (HU vehicle). Five days to the cessation of HU dosing, all mice were subjected to folliculogenesis induction with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG). Five mice/group were anesthetized at 48 hours post PMSG to facilitate blood collection via cardiac puncture for estradiol- 17 β (E 2) measurement by RIA. Ovulation was induced in the remaining mice at 48 hours post PMSG with human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) and immediately caged with adult males for mating. Five <b>plugged</b> <b>female</b> mice/group were sacrificed for the determination of ovulation rate. The remaining mated mice were sacrificed about 26 hours post hCG, ovaries excised and weighed and embryos harvested and cultured in Whitten’s medium (WM) supplemented with CZBt. In Experiments 2 and 3, (N = 10 /Experiment) folliculogenesis and ovulation were induced in untreated mice followed by mating. Recovered embryos were either exposed continuously (Experiment 2) or intermittently (Experiment 3) to bioavailable HU (18 μg HU/mL of WM + CZBt) or WM + CZBt only (control). Treated mice sustained decreased ovarian wt, ovulation rate and circulating E 2 compared with controls (P < 0. 05). Fewer embryos retrieved from HU-treated mice developed to blastocyst stage (32 %) compared with those from controls (60 %; P < 0. 05). Furthermore, continuous or intermittent in vitro exposures of embryos to HU also resulted in reduced development to blastocyst stage (continuous HU, 9 vs. control, 63 %; P < 0. 05; intermittent HU, 20 vs. control, 62 %; P < 0. 05) with embryos exposed continuously to HU in vitro fairing worse. Even though HU is well tolerated, our data suggest that it compromises folliculogenesis and the ability of generated embryos to develop. Therefore, designed studies with larger numbers of patients receiving HU during pregnancy, with longer follow-up of exposed children and more careful assessment of embryo/fetotoxic effects, are required before this agent can be promoted as safe in pregnancy...|$|R
