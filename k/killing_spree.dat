5|$|After {{discarding}} two drafts, Bell approached producer Frank Spotnitz for help. Spotnitz {{suggested that}} the dog could escape from a ship and go on a <b>killing</b> <b>spree.</b> In addition, Spotnitz also {{came up with the}} idea for Mulder and Berquist to develop a quasi-romance before the latter is killed at the end of the episode.

The episode ended up being re-written right up to the start of shooting on February 2.|$|E

5|$|Kemper was {{released}} {{at the age}} of 21 after convincing Atascadero psychiatrists that he had been rehabilitated. Kemper was regarded as nonthreatening by his victims. He solely targeted young female hitchhikers during his <b>killing</b> <b>spree,</b> luring them into his vehicle and driving them to quiet areas where he would murder them before taking their corpses back to his home to be decapitated, dismembered, and violated. He then murdered his mother and one of her friends before turning himself in to the authorities. He was found sane to stand trial and in 1973 guilty and requested the death penalty for his crimes. However, capital punishment was temporarily suspended in California. He instead received eight life sentences. Since then, Kemper has been incarcerated in the California Medical Facility.|$|E

40|$|Grand Theft Auto is an {{integral}} part of modern culture, but the effects on its players are still being debated. In the wake of the Columbine, Aurora, and Newtown shootings-all of which were committed by players of violent video games-it is important to investigate if the recent surge in public <b>killing</b> <b>sprees</b> can be traced to a particular set of causes. Grand Theft Auto, with its open-world gameplay and ability to simulate mass virtual <b>killing</b> <b>sprees,</b> has been suggested as one of the possible causes of the recent surge in mass violence. This paper examines the relationship between the crime rate and the search volume (provided by Google Trends) of Grand Theft Auto cheat codes. We examine time series data for California from October 2004 through December 2010 and panel data for the entire United States from the years 2005 - 2010. The findings suggest there is no significant relationship between Grand Theft Auto and the crime rate. If such a relationship exists, the relationship is negative, which is shown in both the California time series and the national panel data. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R

5|$|Maneater is a 2007 American {{television}} natural horror film {{directed by}} Gary Yates and produced by RHI Entertainment, starring Gary Busey, Ty Wood, and Ian D. Clark. The film aired on various {{video on demand}} channels, before officially premiering in the United States on the Syfy Channel on September 8, 2007.

Based on Jack Warner's novel Shikar, the film details the <b>killing</b> <b>spree</b> of an escaped Bengal tiger after it gets loose in a small town along the Appalachian Trail. Trying to stop it are Sheriff Barnes (Busey) and big game hunter Colonel Graham (Clark), while a young boy named Roy (Wood) who has a strange connection to the tiger, tries to save it. It is the 4th film in the Maneater Series.|$|E
5|$|Players are {{penalized for}} using certain vampiric {{abilities}} {{in front of}} witnesses; exposing their existence loses masquerade points, although additional masquerade points can be earned with quests and other actions. Violating the masquerade five times draws the ire of vampire hunters and loses the game. The player has humanity points, representing the vampire's humanity. Some actions cost humanity points; a low humanity score alters available dialog options to become more aggressive, and increases the chance of entering a frenzied state and embarking on a <b>killing</b> <b>spree,</b> when the vampire's blood is low. This frenzy can also be triggered by {{a large amount of}} damage. Like masquerade points, losing all humanity points ends the game, with the vampire becoming a mindless beast. Some areas, known as Elysium, prevent the use of Disciplines or weapons. Players can recruit a female ghoul, Heather, as a customizable servant who gives them blood, gifts, and money.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} deteriorated {{in early}} 1993, when the teams in Arusha signed a full power sharing agreement, dividing government positions between the MRND, RPF {{and other major}} opposition parties, but excluding the CDR. This government was supposed to rule the country under a transitional constitution until {{free and fair elections}} could be held. The agreement was reasonably equitable given the balance of power at the time and Habyarimana, the mainstream opposition and the RPF all accepted it; however, the CDR and hardline MRND officers were violently opposed. MRND national secretary Mathieu Ngirumpatse announced that the party would not respect the agreement, contradicting both the president and the party's negotiators in Arusha. The MRND hardliners organised demonstrations across the country and mobilised their supporters within the army and populace to begin a much larger scale <b>killing</b> <b>spree</b> than those that had previously occurred. The violence engulfed the whole northwest of Rwanda and lasted for six days, with numerous houses burned and hundreds of Tutsi killed. Paul Kagame, reacting to stories brought to him first hand by survivors seeking refuge in rebel territory, announced that he was pulling out of the Arusha process and resuming the war, ending the six month cease-fire.|$|E
5|$|Elephants {{typically}} coexist peacefully {{with other}} herbivores, which will usually {{stay out of}} their way. Some aggressive interactions between elephants and rhinoceros have been recorded. At Aberdare National Park, Kenya, a rhino attacked an elephant calf and was killed by the other elephants in the group. At Hluhluwe–Umfolozi Game Reserve, South Africa, introduced young orphan elephants went on a <b>killing</b> <b>spree</b> that {{claimed the lives of}} 36 rhinos during the 1990s, but ended with the introduction of older males. The size of adult elephants makes them nearly invulnerable to predators, though there are rare reports of adult elephants falling prey to tigers. Calves may be preyed on by lions, spotted hyenas, and wild dogs in Africa and tigers in Asia. The lions of Savuti, Botswana, have adapted to hunting juvenile elephants during the dry season, and a pride of 30 lions has been recorded killing juvenile individuals between the ages of four and eleven years. Elephants appear to distinguish between the growls of larger predators like tigers and smaller ones like leopards (which have not been recorded killing calves); the latter they react less fearfully and more aggressively to. Elephants tend to have high numbers of parasites, particularly nematodes, compared to other herbivores. This is due to lower predation pressures that would otherwise kill off many of the individuals with significant parasite loads.|$|E

40|$|Purpose – <b>Spree</b> <b>killing</b> impacts {{significantly}} on {{emergency services}} and {{is becoming more}} prevalent across the world. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to explore the Cumbrian <b>spree</b> <b>killing,</b> which resulted in the fatal shooting of 12 people with a further 11 wounded. This study highlights why these events are so difficult to manage in an attempt to assist policy makers and practitioners deal with them more effectively. Design/methodology/approach – A qualitative methodology was used, examining open source information and internal police documentation. This was supported by semi-structured interviews with command staff (three), and questionnaires involving a representative group of police staff (11), who were all deployed on the incident. Findings – This case study mirrored the characteristics of many other <b>spree</b> <b>killings.</b> The sophistication of the killer, together with the speed of mobility, significantly increases the challenges posed to the police, specifically in terms of: deployment, decision making, interoperability and managing the media. Further, it questions the effectiveness of normal command and control management approaches that are typically used in these situations. Practical implications – <b>Spree</b> <b>killing</b> (active shooter) events are increasing across the globe. This study highlights the critical challenges to be dealt with. It argues a more innovative inter-agency paradigm is needed to deal with crimes in action. Originality/value – There are few academic papers in relation to <b>spree</b> <b>killing.</b> This paper analyses the factors that impact upon the effectiveness of the police response...|$|R
