40|$|Characteristics of time gaps (that is, {{the time}} {{separation}} between {{the rear of the}} lead vehicle and the front of the following vehicle) in congested freeway flow provide an important link between microscopic and macroscopic traffic flow. Although individual time gaps are a microscopic phenomenon, <b>average</b> <b>time</b> gaps can easily be determined from commonly collected macroscopic traffic flow data. Data from San Diego freeways and the Queen Elizabeth Way in Ontario, Canada are analyzed to show that <b>average</b> <b>time</b> gaps in congested flow are essentially constant with respect to speed; that they vary considerably between lanes at a single location and, for the same lane, from site to site; that they display considerable scatter; and that at some sites there is a distinct increase in <b>average</b> <b>time</b> gaps in the median lane in the transition to congested flow but at others there is no change or a slight reduction. The variability of <b>average</b> <b>time</b> gaps is not easily explained, although differences in driver populations may partly explain differences among different sites.
