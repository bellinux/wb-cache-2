25|$|These {{changes were}} unusual {{not only because}} the extent and timing of the changes meant that {{construction}} took place during the school year, but also because <b>Drillbit</b> Taylor production did not pay for the re-tiling. The district had provided money to re-tile floors throughout the LAUSD, so the re-tiling of the floors itself was not unusual or controversial. However, as the film's production needs guided the color choices for the re-tiling and the schedule for construction, many students were upset by the behavior of the movie company and the school.|$|E
25|$|Apatow met actress Leslie Mann {{on the set}} of the 1996 comedy film, The Cable Guy, {{where she}} was cast as Matthew Broderick's character's girlfriend and Apatow served as producer. They were married on June 9, 1997 in Los Angeles, and have two daughters, Maude and Iris. Mann has {{appeared}} in Freaks and Geeks, The 40-Year-Old Virgin, Knocked Up, <b>Drillbit</b> Taylor, Funny People, and This is 40. Both daughters appeared in Knocked Up, Funny People, and This Is 40, as Leslie Mann's character's daughters, and Maude was nominated at the 34th Young Artist Awards for Best Performance in a Feature Film – Supporting Young Actress for This is 40.|$|E
500|$|Rogen's {{projects}} in 2008 included Jimmy Hayward's Horton Hears a Who!, an animated film {{based on the}} Dr. Seuss book, that Rogen voiced a character in. Rogen additionally co-wrote <b>Drillbit</b> Taylor, also produced by Apatow and starring Owen Wilson as the homeless titular character. He based the screenplay on a 70-page scriptment done by John Hughes. The movie was panned by critics who thought its plot – a grown man becoming three kids' bodyguard and beating up their bullies – had no focus and was drawn out. [...] "If Superbad were remade as a gimmicky Nickelodeon movie, it would probably look something like <b>Drillbit</b> Taylor" [...] Josh Bell wrote in the Las Vegas Weekly. He again lent his voice to another animated movie, this time Kung Fu Panda, with Jack Black and Angelina Jolie. It did exceptionally well in theatres, making more than $630million. Rogen, Goldberg and Apatow were behind the stoner action comedy Pineapple Express directed by David Gordon Green at Columbia Pictures. Apatow produced it while Rogen and Goldberg wrote the script. Rogen was chosen to play the film's protagonist, a 25-year-old who accidentally witnesses a murder while delivering a subpoena. James Franco was cast as his hippie pot dealer that he goes on the run with. When asked about its inspiration, Rogen said he wrote what he knew. Pineapple Express was released to theatres on August 6 and made $101million in ticket sales against its $27million production budget. Movie critics lauded it, appreciating their performances and its humor.|$|E
50|$|Zuni jewelry-making {{dates back}} to Ancestral Pueblo prehistory. Early Zuni lapidaries used stone and antler tools, wooden drills with flake stone, or cactus spine <b>drillbits,</b> as well as {{abrading}} tools made of wood and stone, sand for smoothing, and fiber cords for stringing.|$|R
25|$|Nodena Phase peoples traded {{with other}} groups {{to the west and}} {{northwest}} in the Crowley's Ridge and Ozark Highlands areas for usable stone to make tools. Because of the conditions of the floodplain geography where they lived, no stone was available locally. Chert, basalt, and sandstone were turned into a variety of tools such as celts, chisels, adzes, abraders, hammerstones, hoes, <b>drillbits,</b> mortar and pestles, spear points, and arrow heads. A popular arrow head style is known as the Nodena point, a delicate leaf like shape. Sandstone was also ground and polished into a discoidal shape for use in the game of chunkey.|$|R
40|$|Individual {{component}} reliability {{can often be}} estimated from degradation signals. In this paper, we examine {{the utility of the}} wavelet transform in pre-processing degradation signals for on-line reliability estimation. Wavelet preprocessing facilitates examination of degradation signals in both the time- and frequency-domains, simultaneously. Neural networks are used for forecasting the degradation signals (or a transformation thereof) and estimating the likelihood that these signals would exceed a pre-determined critical plane representative of unit failure in the immediate future. This leads to an on-line estimate for individual unit reliability. The proposed method is applied for analyzing degradation signals collected from a vertical CNC drilling machine using drill-bits. The degradation signals, force and torque, were collected as the <b>drillbits</b> were destructively tested...|$|R

2500|$|Apatow {{served as}} {{producer}} and co-writer along with director Jake Kasdan for the biopic spoof [...] starring John C.

In 2008, he served as producer for <b>Drillbit</b> Taylor starring Owen Wilson and his wife Leslie Mann and written by Seth Rogen, which opened in March and earned negative reviews. Apatow retracted {{his support for the}} movie, feeling it was not what he had initially envisioned. For the rest of 2008, Apatow produced the comedy films Forgetting Sarah Marshall starring Jason Segel and Kristen Bell; Step Brothers, which reunites Talladega Nights co-stars Will Ferrell and John C. Reilly; and Pineapple Express starring Seth Rogen and James Franco, both of whom originally starred on Freaks and Geeks. In addition, he served as co-writer for the Adam Sandler comedy film You Don't Mess with the Zohan, which Sandler and Robert Smigel also co-wrote.|$|E
