40|$|Abstract — We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} to build approximate maps of structured environments utilizing human motion and activity. Our approach uses data recorded with a <b>data</b> <b>suit</b> which is equipped with several IMUs to detect movements of a person and door opening and closing events. In our approach we interpret the movements as motion constraints and door handling events as landmark detections in a graph-based SLAM framework. As we cannot distinguish between individual doors, we employ a multi-hypothesis approach {{on top of the}} SLAM system to deal with the high data-association uncertainty. As a result, our approach is able to accurately and robustly recover the trajectory of the person. We additionally take advantage of the fact that people traverse free space and that doors separate rooms to recover the geometric structure of the environment after the graph optimization. We evaluate our approach in several experiments carried out with different users and in environments of different types. I...|$|E

40|$|This paper raises two {{difficulties}} with an earlier {{contribution to this}} Journal (Coles 2001) and proposes solutions. While we strongly support his suggestion that neglect of Social Network Analysis (SNA) has hampered criminology, and welcome his opening up of the debate, we argue that Coles has failed to make an important distinction between types of SNA data collection and presented a flawed 'theoretical framework'. In {{the first section of}} this article, we highlight the difference between egocentric and non-egocentric network data collection. In the former, respondents are asked about their own network ties, while in the latter, they are also asked what they know about the ties of others. It transpires that egocentric <b>data</b> <b>suit</b> qualitative surveys while non-egocentric data harmonize with ethnography. While Coles endorses 'qualitative' SNA, his failure to make a clear distinction between egocentric and non-egocentric data means he confuses criticisms appropriate to two different data collection techniques. In the second section of the article, we argue that the 'theoretical framework' which Coles presents is problematic. He discusses a number of extant findings about the structure of non-criminal networks but fails to support the claim that they can be applied to criminal networks. Such support could either be empirical - showing that the two types of networks were alike - or model based - showing that relevant social interaction mechanisms actually produce similar structural properties in networks. In the absence of either kind of evidence, however, there are ethnographic reasons to expect that criminal networks will have both distinctive generative mechanisms and structural properties. These reasons are discussed in the context of examples provided by Coles. The final section of the paper uses computer simulation to address the two problems raised. The first model shows the conditions under which collection of qualitative (non-egocentric) and quantitative (egocentric) data will produce a more accurate picture of the underlying network. The second (outline) model shows how simulation might link ethnographic data on social interaction to the aggregate properties of networks. The conclusion discusses the consequences of this approach for novel research and criminal intelligence. Citation: Chattoe, E. & Hamill, H. (2005).

40|$|Extravehicular {{activities}} (EVA), {{or space}} walks, are a critical and complex aspect of human spaceflight missions. To prepare for safe and successful {{execution of the}} required tasks, astronauts undergo extensive training in the Neutral Buoyancy Lab (NBL), which involves many hours of performing repetitive motions at various orientations, all while wearing a pressurized spacesuit. The current U. S. spacesuit-the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU) -is pressurized to 29. 6 kPa (4. 3 psi) and requires astronauts to exert {{a substantial amount of}} energy in order to move the suit into a desired position. The pressurization of the suit therefore limits human mobility, causes discomfort, and leads to a variety of contact and strain injuries. Shoulder injuries {{are one of the most}} severe injuries that astronauts contend with, and are mainly attributed to the EMU's hard upper torso (HUT). While suit-related injuries have been observed for many years and some basic countermeasures have been implemented, there is still a lack of understanding of how humans move inside the spacesuit. The objective of this research is therefore to gain a greater understanding of this human-spacesuit interaction and potential for shoulder injury through two approaches: quantifying and analyzing the suit-induced pressures that arise in the shoulder region, and comparing the shoulder muscle forces that arise in the unsuited and suited conditions by modeling human-spacesuit interaction. The first approach provides an "inside look" of the pressure distributions and pressure profiles that arise at the interface between the human shoulder and the torso of the spacesuit, thereby suggesting which areas of the shoulder might be prone to contact injury. A commercially produced pressure sensing system is used to collect shoulder pressure data during a human subject experiment that involves three experienced subjects performing a series of upper body motions in both unsuited and suited conditions. Pressure distributions reveal that: 1) the least experienced subject generates the highest pressures, 2) for the majority of movements for all subjects, pressure is concentrated just above the clavicle over the soft musculature at the top of the shoulder, 3) the top of the shoulder is one of the regions in which maximum pressure is located most frequently, and 4) the shoulder blade is a secondary region of concern with regards to frequency of experiencing maximum pressure. Pressure profile analysis reveals that 1) for most subjects, general profile trends vary in shape across movement groups, 2) repetitions within each movement group are consistent in shape, and for most subjects also in magnitude, 3) the highest pressures are typically found near the top of the shoulder, and 4) the shoulder blade area is of concern for at least one subject. As these results are primarily observational in nature, a statistical analysis is performed to assess the effects of motion type and anthropometric region on peak pressure magnitudes. This analysis shows that results cannot be generalized across subjects as they are likely affected by individual anthropometry, suit fit, and the biomechanics of how each subject performs the motion. However, a number of interesting trends regarding which motions or regions yield higher pressures are found for each of the individual subjects. The results are specific to the subjects, suit sizes, and experimental conditions used in this particular experiment; however, the application of these quantitative and repeatable techniques during future experiments, suit fit sessions, or NBL runs would lead to a more complete understanding of human-spacesuit interaction at the shoulder interface. The second approach analyzes the effects of spacesuits on muscle forces in the shoulder region. Data regarding spacesuit joint torques and the joint angles of a suited subject are integrated into an upper-extremity musculoskeletal model in OpenSim to evaluate which muscles are most affected by the spacesuit. Looking specifically at a shoulder abduction/adduction motion, shoulder abductors, adductors, and stabilizer muscle groups are evaluated for significant changes in force from the unsuited to suited condition, and individual muscles within the shoulder region are also evaluated for significant changes from the unsuited to suited conditions. From a statistical analysis of the musculoskeletal simulation results, it is found that of the three investigated muscle groups-shoulder abductors, adductors, and stabilizers-only the abductors experience a statistically significant change in total muscle force between the unsuited and suited conditions. Looking specifically at the individual muscles that constitute the abductors and stabilizers, we find that only the middle deltoid experienced a statistically significant change in force from the unsuited to suited condition. A number of explanations are provided for the observed force profiles and the statistical results. The presented results are specific to the subject's motion <b>data,</b> <b>suit</b> torque data, and the musculoskeletal model that are used; however expanding this analysis to more subjects, other body joints, and a more complex musculoskeletal model would provide useful results for industry experts. Valuable information could be provided to EVA operations teams, flight doctors, and spacesuit designers regarding which movements or tasks should be avoided or performed minimally to prevent injury. The resulting muscle forces could also be used to set limits on the joint torques that are engineered in future spacesuits. Each of the approaches implemented in this thesis provides a different avenue for addressing the issue of shoulder injury in the spacesuit. While the pressure analysis contributes to the understanding of human-spacesuit interaction by informing on the anthropometric regions that might be most susceptible to contact injury, the musculoskeletal analysis provides insight as to which individual muscles are most susceptible to strain injury. Both of these quantitative, evidence-based approaches contribute to an increased understanding of the potential for shoulder injury in the spacesuit. by Alexandra Marie Hilbert. Thesis: S.
