In t roduct ion Despite the excellent short-term mechanical properties of high-performance polyethylene (HP-PE) fibres [1, 2], these fibres show a pronounced time dependent behaviour under continuous static loadings. In contrast to these limiting factors, the viscoelastic character and the relatively high work-to-break of HP-PE fibres compared with carbon, aramid and glass fibres renders them, however, eminentl...|$|E
