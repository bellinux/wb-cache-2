On the contrary, we have been received with the most unvarying courtesy and fairness {{both on and off the}} field.

Among the six reasons McCartney gave for dissolving the Beatles was that Klein's company, ABKCO, had caused [...] "intolerable interference" [...] by overdubbing [...] "The Long and Winding Road" [...] without consulting McCartney. In his written affidavit, Starr countered this statement by saying that when Spector had sent acetates of Let <b>It</b> <b>Be</b> <b>to</b> each of the Beatles for their approval, with a request also for feedback: [...] "We all said yes. Even at the beginning Paul said yes. I spoke to him on the phone, and said, 'Did you like it?' and he said, 'Yeah, it's OK.' He didn't put it down."

2500|$|The {{controversy}} drew sharp rebuttals from Law and Foreign Affairs Minister K. Shanmugam. In {{a speech}} at a forum organized by the Institute of Policy Studies, he argued that voters elect the President {{for the purpose of}} enabling him to exercise the discretionary powers granted to him under the Constitution, which means the President's accountability to the electorate is restricted to these matters. He then raised the argument that since Article 21(1) states that the President shall, [...] "in the exercise of his functions under this Constitution or any other written law, act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet", it would be unconstitutional for the President to speak on his own volition in the absence of Cabinet's advice. He also said that the President's constitutional position {{is similar to that of}} the British Monarch, quoting a letter of 4 December 1963 from the British Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin to King Edward VIII in which it was stated that [...] "Ministers are willing to give an experienced Monarch who thoroughly understands and has always strictly observed constitutional limitations, a discretion to what he would say, and are content to take full responsibility knowing well that the Monarch will say nothing of which his Ministers would not approve". Shanmugam posed the question: [...] "If the purpose is to influence the Government, would the best approach be to go public, or would <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> speak to the Prime Minister– as is generally done?" ...|$|E
2500|$|Ionesco, however, hated Sartre bitterly. Ionesco accused Sartre of {{supporting}} Communism but ignoring the atrocities committed by Communists; he wrote Rhinoceros as {{a criticism of}} blind conformity, whether <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> Nazism or Communism; {{at the end of}} the play, one man remains on Earth resisting transformation into a rhinoceros [...] Sartre criticized Rhinoceros by questioning: [...] "Why is there one man who resists? At least we could learn why, but no, we learn not even that. He resists because he is there". [...] Sartre's criticism highlights a primary difference between the Theatre of the Absurd and existentialism: the Theatre of the Absurd shows the failure of man without recommending a solution. In a 1966 interview, Claude Bonnefoy, comparing the Absurdists to Sartre and Camus, said to Ionesco, [...] "It seems to me that Beckett, Adamov and yourself started out less from philosophical reflections or a return to classical sources, than from first-hand experience and a desire to find a new theatrical expression that would enable you to render this experience in all its acuteness and also its immediacy. If Sartre and Camus thought out these themes, you expressed them in a far more vital contemporary fashion". Ionesco replied, [...] "I have the feeling that these writers – who are serious and important – were talking about absurdity and death, but that they never really lived these themes, that they did not feel them within themselves in an almost irrational, visceral way, that all this was not deeply inscribed in their language. With them it was still rhetoric, eloquence. With Adamov and Beckett it really is a very naked reality that is conveyed through the apparent dislocation of language".|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Essay" [...] was {{composed}} {{at a time}} when the prestige of Rymer and neo-Aristotelianism in England was already declining, and though Wesley expressed some admiration for Rapin and Le Bossu, he is by no means docile under their authority. Whatever the weight of authority, he says, [...] "I see no cause why Poetry should not be brought to the Test , as well as Divinity...." [...] As to the sacred example of Homer, who based his great epic on mythology, Wesley remarks, [...] "But this [...] being now antiquated, I cannot think we are oblig'd superstitiously to follow his Example, any more than to make Horses speak, as he does that of Achilles." [...] To the question of the formidable Boileau, [...] "What Pleasure can <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>to</b> hear the howlings of repining Lucifer?" [...] our critic responds flippantly,"I think 'tis easier to answer than to find out what shew of Reason he had for asking it, or why Lucifer mayn't howl as pleasantly as either Cerberus, or Knoeladus." [...] Without hesitation or apology he takes issue with Rapin's conception of Decorum in the epic. But Wesley is empiricist as well as rationalist, and the judgment of authority can be upset by appeal to the court of experience. To Balzac's suggestion that, to avoid difficult and local proper names in poetry, generalized terms be used, such as Ill-luck for the Fates and the Foul Fiend for Lucifer, our critic replies with jaunty irony, [...] "... and whether this wou'd not sound extremely Heroical, I leave any Man to judge", and thus he dismisses the matter. Similarly, when Rapin objects to Tasso's mingling of lyric softness in the majesty of the epic, Wesley points out sharply that no man of taste will part with the fine scenes of tender love in Tasso, Dryden, Ovid, Ariosto, and Spenser [...] "for the sake of a fancied Regularity." [...] He had set out to defend the Biblical epic, the Christian epic, and the propriety of Christian machines in epic, and no rules or authority could deter him.

I, apropos of the poet's use of obsolete words (Life of Our Blessed Lord, 1697, p.27): It may be in vicious imitation of Milton and Spenser, he says in effect, but I have a fondness for old words, they please my ear, and that is all the reason I can give for employing them.|$|E
