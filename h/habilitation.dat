In 1919 the University of Göttingen allowed Noether to proceed with her <b>habilitation</b> (eligibility for tenure). Her oral examination was held in late May, and she successfully delivered her <b>habilitation</b> lecture in June.|$|E

In 1921 he became a profesor nadzwyczajny (associate professor) and in 1925 profesor zwyczajny (full professor) at the same university. During this time he taught a course on the then cutting edge theory of Lebesgue integration, one of the first such courses offered outside France.|$|E
5|$|Szilard was {{appointed}} as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 {{he finished his}} <b>habilitation</b> and became a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. For his <b>habilitation</b> lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's Demon, Über die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important {{in the history of}} attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper is also the first equation of negative entropy and information. As such, it established Szilard as {{one of the founders of}} information theory, but he did not publish it until 1929, and did not pursue it further. Claude E. Shannon, who took it up in the 1950s, acknowledged Szilard's paper as his starting point.|$|E

He then held teaching and research positions in Germany and in the US, namely at the University of Kiel, Syracuse University and Hamburg University. From 1964 to 1965, {{he was at the}} Graduate Research Center of the Southwest in Dallas. From 1965 to 1971, he held various positions in Alfred Schild's group at the University of Texas at Austin, starting as an associate professor and, in 1967, obtaining a position as full professor. During that time, he held visiting professorships at the universities of Würzburg and Bonn.|$|E

5|$|After Bethe {{received}} his doctorate, Erwin Madelung offered him an assistantship in Frankfurt, and in September 1928 Bethe {{moved in with}} his father, who had recently divorced his mother. His father met Vera Congehl earlier that year, and married her in 1929. They had two children, Doris, born in 1933, and Klaus, born in 1934. Bethe did not find the work in Frankfurt very stimulating, and in 1929 he accepted an offer from Ewald at the Technische Hochschule in Stuttgart. While there, he wrote what he considered to be his greatest paper, Zur Theorie des Durchgangs schneller Korpuskularstrahlen durch Materie ("The Theory of the Passage of Fast Corpuscular Rays Through Matter"). Starting from Max Born's interpretation of the Schrödinger equation, Bethe produced a simplified formula for collision problems using a Fourier transform, which is known today as the Bethe formula. He submitted this paper for his <b>habilitation</b> in 1930.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, Albert Einstein {{published}} his paper On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies about special relativity. Born was intrigued, and began researching the subject. He was devastated {{to discover that}} Minkowski was also researching special relativity along the same lines, but when he wrote to Minkowski about his results, Minkowski asked {{him to return to}} Göttingen and do his <b>habilitation</b> there. Born accepted. Toeplitz helped Born brush up on his matrix algebra so he could work with the four-dimensional Minkowski space matrices used in the latter's project to reconcile relativity with electrodynamics. Born and Minkowski got along well, and their work made good progress, but Minkowski died suddenly of appendicitis on 12 January 1909. The mathematics students had Born speak on their behalf at the funeral.|$|E
5|$|Noether {{was born}} to a Jewish family in the Franconian town of Erlangen; {{her father was a}} mathematician, Max Noether. She {{originally}} planned to teach French and English after passing the required examinations, but instead studied mathematics at the University of Erlangen, where her father lectured. After completing her dissertation in 1907 under the supervision of Paul Gordan, she worked at the Mathematical Institute of Erlangen without pay for seven years. At the time, women were largely excluded from academic positions. In 1915, she was invited by David Hilbert and Felix Klein to join the mathematics department at the University of Göttingen, a world-renowned center of mathematical research. The philosophical faculty objected, however, and she spent four years lecturing under Hilbert's name. Her <b>habilitation</b> was approved in 1919, allowing her to obtain the rank of Privatdozent.|$|E

5|$|Von Neumann's <b>habilitation</b> was {{completed}} on December 13, 1927, {{and he started}} his lectures as a privatdozent at the University of Berlin in 1928, being the youngest person ever elected privatdozent in its history in any subject. By the end of 1927, von Neumann had published twelve major papers in mathematics, {{and by the end}} of 1929, thirty-two papers, at a rate of nearly one major paper per month. His reputed powers of memorization and recall allowed him to quickly memorize the pages of telephone directories, and recite the names, addresses and numbers therein. In 1929, he briefly became a privatdozent at the University of Hamburg, where the prospects of becoming a tenured professor were better, but in October of that year a better offer presented itself when he was invited to Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey.|$|E

50|$|In 1973, {{the right}} to award {{doctoral}} degrees {{in cooperation with the}} theological faculties in Erlangen and Munich was conferred to the Divinity School. Since 1990, the Augustana-Hochschule can award doctoral degrees and <b>Habilitations</b> independently.|$|R
25|$|Academic {{degrees and}} titles {{obtained}} at HSU are equivalent to those awarded by state universities and are equally valid, since the courses {{comply with the}} requirements of Hamburg's higher education legislation.

25|$|In 1925, {{while still}} at the PTR, Bothe became a Privatdozent at the University of Berlin, which means that he had {{completed}} his <b>Habilitation,</b> and, in 1929, he became an ausserordentlicher Professor (extraordinarius professor) there.|$|E
25|$|In 1954 he {{completed}} his mathematical {{studies at the}} Jagiellonian University in Kraków, obtained his doctorate at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in 1958, <b>habilitation</b> in 1962, the title of associate professor in 1966, and the title of professor in 1973.|$|E
50|$|The Divinity School is {{independent}} of the state, yet stately recognized. Students usually take up the undergraduate and graduate programms of the Augustana-Hochschule {{in order to become}} pastors in the various Landeskirchen (regional churches) in Germany. The Divinity School has got the right to award doctoral degrees and <b>Habilitations.</b> The Augustana-Hochschule is, thus, on par with theological faculties at state universities.|$|R
50|$|The EBS Universität offers degree {{programmes}} at {{the undergraduate}} and graduate levels. The EBS Business School offers traditional German business and economics (Betriebswirtschaftslehre) education as well as specialized MSc programmes in Management, Finance, and other areas. The EBS Law School offers degree courses leading to the German State Examination in jurisprudence. Both faculties also offer doctoral programmes and award <b>habilitations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Rasp built a {{work group}} and {{assisted}} 21 dissertations and two <b>habilitations.</b> In 1997 he reached venia legendi as Dr. med. habil. {{and was named}} '"Privatdozent".

In 2003 he was named associate professor.|$|R
25|$|For {{professors at}} a Fachhochschule, {{at least three}} years of work {{experience}} are required for appointment while a <b>habilitation</b> is not expected. This is unlike their counterparts at traditional universities, where an academic career with research experience is necessary.|$|E
25|$|Gödel {{earned his}} <b>habilitation</b> at Vienna in 1932, and in 1933 {{he became a}} Privatdozent (unpaid lecturer) there. In 1933 Adolf Hitler {{came to power in}} Germany, and over the {{following}} years the Nazis rose in influence in Austria, and among Vienna's mathematicians.|$|E
25|$|Lech Kaczyński was a {{graduate}} of law and administration of Warsaw University. In 1980 he was awarded his PhD by Gdańsk University.

50|$|In German-language countries, {{the term}} Hochschule is more general than Universität (plural: Universitäten) and also {{encompasses}} universities {{which do not}} have the right to confer doctorates and <b>habilitations,</b> in contrast to Universitäten. Today, Universitäten as well as other Hochschulen call themselves Technische Hochschule for historical reasons. However, a Technische Hochschule with the status of a Universität is regarded as a Technische Universität despite the name.|$|R
50|$|In {{the period}} of 1945-2005 from the Faculty of Chemistry {{graduated}} more than 7.000 people, including 4877 masters of engineering and 1967 engineers. PhD degree was given 565, and 97 DSc degrees (<b>habilitations).</b> A total of 43 professors have held posts at GUT during this time.
