40|$|Average {{losses of}} the {{electric}} drive throughout a driving cycle are an important issue for hybrid electric vehicles. Permanent magnet synchronous electric motors (PMSM) are the most efficient electric drives under load conditions. However, they suffer from <b>idle</b> <b>losses</b> at high speed and low load, which is a typical operating condition in highway cycles. This leads, in some cases, to even higher fuel consumption of HEV vs. conventional vehicles. As well designed permanent magnet machines for HEV usually have excellent efficiency at operating points close to their rating, {{the main focus of}} the presented work is achieving an improvement in no load and reduced load conditions. Such losses will occur at high speed and low load, because the PMSM creates an induced voltage exceeding the battery voltage, which must be compensated by an inductive voltage drop through the motor inductance by a purely reactive current causing losses. A proposal for a special design for PMSM with regard to the ability of active reduction of those losses at high speeds is made in the following comment: The compensation current depends on the motor inductance. Obviously, a high inductance in the axis of magnetization needs a low compensation current, whereas a low inductance in the quadrature-axis results in a large constant power range. So a special design of an asymmetrical PMSM has been developed in order to achieve minimum <b>idle</b> <b>losses...</b>|$|E
40|$|A class D audio {{amplifier}} {{usually have a}} high efficiency for medium to high output power. However, in idle mode and for small power outputs, the efficiency drops. During idle mode, the output switches runs with a 50 % duty cycle {{in order to create}} zero volt over the load. The main task of this thesis was to investigate if the <b>idle</b> <b>losses</b> could be decreased by lowering the voltage feeding the amplifier. This without lowering the efficiency on normal operation. Three designs solutions to lower the voltage have been created and investigated. Two solutions switches between two separate rails, each at a different voltage level. The third uses a dual-polarity buck converter to feed the amplifier with just above the necessary voltage at all times. The designs were simulated in PSpice and the result analysed using both PSpice and MATLAB. It was concluded that all three solutions work as intended and lowers the idle power consumption without adding any extra loss of efficiency at normal operation. An attempt was made at implementing the buck converters on a printed circuit board. The results from the measurements performed on the prototype showed that the PWM signal generation and surrounding control circuits worked. The power path was also intact, however only DC output could be achieved for frequencies above 500 Hz...|$|E

The research in transmission losses opened for a thesis project for when a new test rig for power recirculation was needed. The thesis is performed in Tribolab at Luleå University of Technology and Vicura AB has contributed its expertise in transmission and several components for the rig.

In the initial phase of the work was a literature review of what exists in the current situation in the area carried out. One of the most known test rigs for power recirculation is FZG. In addition to the FZG rig Lulea University of Technology had another test rig in this area before. By gathering information from these and numerous other rigs an idea was created of what will be required. After this part there was a visit to Vicura AB in Trollhättan, here were several existing transmission tests discussed and past experience was aired. After the identication of problem areas a number of requirements were set. The functions that were required and those that were more desirable were specied. The development of the rig started with generating numerous concepts and making a layout. For concept selection a rough screening was carried out based on the experience of literature and the four remaining concepts utilized a concept weighting matrix. With a solid team concept began the next phase and Design in development. This is mainly of CAD models, drawings and assembling.

40|$|ABSTRACT Nowadays {{transducers}} are ubiquitous as interfaces {{between the}} increasingly digital {{world and the}} real physical world. The same holds for the power amplifiers driving them. This thesis focuses on the design and optimization of high-voltage class-D amplifiers, which are used for driving capacitive piezoelectric actuator loads in active vibration/noise control applications. The main objective is to further enhance class-D power efficiency compared to existing class-D designs. To gain insight in class D power efficiency, {{a detailed analysis of}} high-voltage class-D dissipation sources is performed and a dissipation model including all the major dissipation sources is developed. The analysis shows that switching loss is a potential dominating dissipation source in high-voltage applications, while its contribution can be minimized by fast switching to eliminate V-I overlap losses. Moreover, it is shown that when varying the class-D switching frequency, a minimum total dissipation exists, with the optimal switching frequency depending on the output power. Furthermore, <b>idle</b> <b>loss</b> reduction by increasing the switching frequency and inserting a dead time to the power stage is backed by the analysis. Following the analysis, a fast-switching power stage is designed to aim for switching loss minimization. This output stage design features immunity to the on-chip supply bounce, realized by internally regulated floating supplies, variable driving strength for the gate driver, and an efficient 2 -step level shifter design. Fast switching transitions and low switching loss are achieved with 94 % peak efficiency for the complete class-D power stage in the realized chip. In addition, gate driver sizing procedures for the class-D output stage are discussed, showing that the variable gate driving strength can greatly improve efficiency when on-chip supply bounce is the limiting factor. Also based on the dissipation analysis, this thesis describes the design of an efficiency-improved high-voltage class-D power amplifier. The amplifier adaptively regulates its switching frequency for optimal power efficiency across the full output power range. This is based on detecting the switching output node voltage level at the turn-on transition of the power switches. For the final chip prototype, the amplifier achieves 93 % efficiency at 45 W output power, > 80 % power efficiency down to 4. 5 W output power and > 49 % efficiency down to 0. 45 W output power. Finally, for the aim of <b>idle</b> <b>loss</b> reduction, the linearity degradation of dead time insertion and switching frequency increase is discussed in this thesis. To cope with this linearity degradation, both open-loop and closed-loop error correction techniques are explored and it is further shown that a higher-order loop filter combined with uniform sampling once per switching cycle is potentially a suitable choice for closed-loop fixed-carrier class-D implementations...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} an efficient method for eddy current analysis in permanent magnets (PM) used in electric machines. Due to appreciable electric conductivity of sintered PM the energy losses related to induced eddy currents cannot be neglected. Since the resulting {{increase of temperature}} may weaken the magnetomotive force or even demagnetize the PM material. Two numerical approaches for eddy current calculations in massive materials are commonly applied: 2 d model (assuming infinite axial length) and 3 d model (usually suffering from numerical inefficiency). In this paper we discuss numerically efficient method for eddy current computation taking actual axial length into account. We propose to extend the 2 d field-circuit-motion time-stepping model to 3 d model of induced electric field {{in the area of}} massive conducting elements, for instance, the PM of electric motor.

This includes, for example: warm air furnaces with electric water heaters; boilers with integrated hot water coils; and boilers with 'indirect' hot water storage tanks. Integrated hydronic systems which provide both heat and hot water are more popular only in the Northeast and mid-Atlantic regions. For those making decisions about configurations of these integrated hydronic systems, including control options, little information is available concerning the annual energy cost implications of these decisions. This report presents results of a project to use a direct load emulation approach to measure the performance of hydronic systems, develop performance curves, and to provide decision tools to consumers.
