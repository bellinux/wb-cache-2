40|$|To {{measure the}} {{scapulohumeral}} rhythm (SHR) in outpatient settings, the motion analysis protocol named ISEO (INAIL Shoulder and Elbow Outpatient protocol) was developed, based on inertial and magnetic sensors. To complete the sensor-to-segment calibration, ISEO requires {{the involvement of}} an operator for sensor placement and for positioning the patient’s arm in a predefined posture. Since this can affect the measure, this study aimed at quantifying ISEO intra- and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement.</b> Forty subjects were considered, together with two operators, A and B. Three measurement sessions were completed for each subject: two by A and one by B. In each session, the humerus and scapula rotations were measured during sagittal and scapular plane elevation movements. ISEO intra- and inter operator agreement were assessed by computing, between sessions, the: (1) similarity of the scapulohumeral patterns through the Coefficient of Multiple Correlation (CMC 2), both considering and excluding the difference of the initial value of the scapula rotations between two sessions (inter-session offset); (2) 95 % Smallest Detectable Difference (SDD 95) in scapula range of motion. Results for CMC 2 showed that the intra- and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> is acceptable (median 0. 85, lower-whisker 0. 75) {{for most of the}} scapula rotations, independently from the movement and the inter-session offset. The only exception is the agreement for scapula protraction–retraction and for scapula medio-lateral rotation during abduction (inter-operator), which is acceptable only if the intersession offset is removed. SDD 95 values ranged from 4. 48 to 8. 68 for the inter-operator and between 4. 98 and 8. 58 for the intra-operator agreement. In conclusion, ISEO presents a high intra- and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement,</b> particularly with the scapula inter-session offset removed...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, three pricing {{scenarios}} are proposed {{to set the}} transaction cost of the <b>inter-operators</b> <b>agreement</b> in a multi-operator cooperative environment. An analysis, of the operators' profits, is performed for these cooperation scenarios and different price sharing models are investigated for comparison. First, we describe the proposed pricing scenarios, the motivation behind and the points of evaluation for each scenario. Then, we present the hybrid decision algorithm for {{the selection of the}} access in a multi-operator wireless networks environment. Next, we present two business models made for the simulation, in order to highlight how network conditions and operator's strategy for service price may affect the profitability of the cooperation. Simulation results show that proposed pricing models guarantee profit gain for the cooperating operators, and are suitable in a multi-operator sharing environment.

40|$|In this paper, {{the problem}} of energy {{efficiency}} in cellular heterogeneous networks (HetNets) is investigated using radio resource and power management combined with the base station (BS) ON/OFF switching. The objective is to minimize the total power consumption of the network while satisfying the quality of service (QoS) requirements of each connected user. We {{consider the case of}} co-existing macrocell BS, small cell BSs, and private femtocell access points (FAPs). Three different network scenarios are investigated, depending on the status of the FAPs, i. e., HetNets without FAPs, HetNets with closed FAPs, and HetNets with semi-closed FAPs. A unified framework is proposed to simultaneously allocate spectrum resources to users in an energy efficient manner and switch off redundant small cell BSs. The high complexity dual decomposition technique is employed to achieve optimal solutions for the problem. A low complexity iterative algorithm is also proposed and its performances are compared to those of the optimal technique. The particularly interesting case of semi-closed FAPs, in which the FAPs accept to serve external users, achieves the highest energy efficiency due to increased degrees of freedom. In this paper, a cooperation scheme between FAPs and mobile operator is also investigated. The incentives for FAPs, e. g., renewable energy sharing and roaming prices, enabling cooperation are discussed to be considered as a useful guideline for <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreements.</b> Comment: 15 pages, 9 Figures, IEEE Transactions on Vehicular Technology 201...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTemporal {{compounding}} {{can be used}} {{to suppress}} acoustic noise in transthoracic cardiac ultrasound by spatially averaging partially decorrelated images acquired over consecutive cardiac cycles. However, the reliable spatial and temporal alignment of the corresponding frames in consecutive cardiac cycles is vital for effective implementation of temporal compounding. This study introduces a novel, efficient, accurate and robust technique for the spatiotemporal alignment of consecutive cardiac cycles with variable temporal characteristics. Furthermore, optimal acquisition parameters, such as the number of consecutive cardiac cycles used, are derived. The effect of the proposed implementation of temporal compounding on cardiac ultrasound images is quantitatively assessed (32 clinical data sets providing a representative range of image qualities and diagnostic values) using measures such as tissue signal-to-noise ratio, chamber signal-to-noise ratio, tissue/chamber contrast and detectability index, as well as a range of clinical measurements, such as chamber diameter and wall thickness, performed during routine echocardiographic examinations. Temporal compounding (as implemented) consistently improved the image quality and diagnostic value of the processed images, when compared with the original data by: (i) increasing tissue and cavity signal-to-noise ratios as well as tissue/cavity detectability index, (ii) improving the corresponding clinical measurement repeatability and <b>inter-operator</b> measurement <b>agreement,</b> while (iii) reducing the number of omitted measurements caused by data corruption...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe goal of {{this study}} was to examine the intra-operator and inter-operator {{differences}} of the manual and semiautomated nuchal translucency (NT) measurements and to evaluate if these differences alter women's risk status. MethodsA cross sectional study was performed. Two operators obtained manual and semiautomated NT measurements of 153 NT images. The maximal acceptable difference in NT measurements within and between operators was 0. 15 mm. Intra and inter-operator differences were analyzed by the paired Student's t-test and homogeneity of variances by the Levene's test. Intra-operator and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> were quantified with Bland and Altman's limits of agreement, and changes in women's risk status were tested with the binomial test. ResultsIntra-operator agreement was high for each of the measurement methods. Operator 1 had lower SDS for manual measurements. Conversely, operator 2 had lower SDS of the differences for semiautomated measurements, although the SD never reached the same level as operator 1. <b>Inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> was highest for the semiautomated measurements. Changes in risk status occurred between the manual and inner-middle method resulting in different clinical policies in up to 1 out of 20 cases.

30|$|Taken together, {{these cases}} suggest that sonopalpation of the kidney {{may be a}} useful and {{reproducible}} finding in confirming or refuting the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis. Kidney sonopalpation may potentially expedite ED care, especially in instances failing to reach an acceptable diagnostic threshold when relying on the tools currently in common use. For example, {{in the absence of}} a typical clinical picture combined with equivocal point-of-care urinalysis results (e.g., positive leukocyte esterase only), the resulting post-test probability of these factors may not surpass the treatment threshold for acute pyelonephritis. Positive renal tenderness to sonopalpation may therefore help confirm the diagnosis in such cases. However, these cases represent a very limited experience, and future studies are needed to establish test characteristics and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> of renal sonopalpation for diagnosing acute pyelonephritis as a part of point-of-care renal ultrasound evaluation.|$|E

The objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the inter-rater and inter-device agreement and reliability of the SEM Scanner. MethodsThirty-one (31) volunteers free of pressure ulcers or broken skin at the sternum, sacrum, and heels were assessed with the SEM Scanner. Each of three operators utilized each of three devices to collect readings from four anatomical sites (sternum, sacrum, left and right heels) on each subject for a total of 108 readings per subject collected over approximately 30  min. For each combination of operator-device-anatomical site, three SEM readings were collected. <b>Inter-operator</b> and inter-device <b>agreement</b> and reliability were estimated. ResultsOver the course of this study, more than 3000 SEM Scanner readings were collected. Agreement between operators was good with mean differences ranging from − 0. 01 to 0. 11. Inter-operator and inter-device reliability exceeded 0. 80 at all anatomical sites assessed. ConclusionThe results of this study demonstrate the high reliability and good agreement of the SEM Scanner across different operators and different devices. Given the limitations of current methods to prevent and detect pressure ulcers, the SEM Scanner shows promise as an objective, reliable tool for assessing the presence or absence of pressure-induced tissue damage such as pressure ulcers...|$|R

Our aim {{was to determine if}} liver stiffness differs between intra-uterine growth restriction (IUGR) and appropriate for gestational age (AGA) preterm infants with/without cholestasis. We measured liver stiffness (in kPa) in 45 AGA and 18 IUGR preterm infants, and assessed reproducibility in 26 preterms using Intraclass Correlation Coefficients (ICC) and Bland-Altman tests. Liver stiffness values were compared between AGA and IUGR with and without cholestasis and correlated with birth weight. Measurements showed high reproducibility (ICC = 0. 94 - 0. 98 for intra-operator, 0. 86 for <b>inter-operator)</b> with good <b>agreement</b> (95 % limits: - 1. 24 to 1. 24 kPa). During the first postnatal week, liver stiffness was higher in IUGR (7. 50 ± 1. 53 kPa) than in AGA infants (5. 11 ± 0. 80 kPa, p< 0. 001). After day 8, liver stiffness remained unchanged in AGA but increased progressively in IUGR infants (15. 57 ± 6. 49 kPa after day 21). Liver stiffness was higher in IUGR neonates with cholestasis (19. 35 ± 9. 80 kPa) than without cholestasis (7. 72 ± 1. 27 kPa, p< 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the clinical utility of current-generation dipole modelling of scalp EEG in focal epilepsies seen commonly in clinical practice. Methods: Scalp EEG recordings from 10 patients with focal epilepsy, five with Benign Focal Epilepsy of Childhood (BFEC) and five with Mesial Temporal Lobe Epilepsy (MTLE), {{were used for}} interictal spike dipole modelling using Scan 4. 3 and CURRY 5. 0. Optimum modelling parameters for EEG source localisation (ESL) were sought by the step-wise application of various volume conductor (forward) and dipole (inverse) models. Best-fit ESL solutions (highest explained forward-fit to measured data variance) were used to characterise best-fit forward and inverse models, regularisation effect, additional electrode effect, single-to-single spike and single-to-averaged spike variability, and intra- and inter-operator concordance. Inter-parameter relationships were examined. Computation times and interface problems were recorded. Results: For both BFEC and MTLE, the best-fit forward model was the finite element method interpolated (FEMi) model, while the best-fit single dipole models were the rotating non-regularised and the moving regularised models. When combined, these forward-inverse models appeared to offer clinically meaningful ESL results when referenced to an averaged cortex overlay, best-fit dipoles localising to the central fissure region in BFEC and to the basolateral temporal region in MTLE. Single-to-single spike and single-to-averaged spike measures of concordance for dipole location and orientation were stronger for BFEC versus MTLE. The use of an additional pair of inferior temporal electrodes in MTLE directed best-fit dipoles towards the basomesial temporal region. Inverse correlations were noted between unexplained variance (RD) and dipole strength (Amp), RD and {{signal to noise ratio}} (SNR), and SNR and confidence ellipsoid (CE) volume. Intra- and <b>inter-operator</b> levels of <b>agreement</b> were relatively robust for dipole location and orientation. Technical problems were infrequent and modelling operations were performed within 5 min. Conclusions: The optimal forward-inverse single dipole modelling set-up for BFEC and MTLE interictal spike analysis is the FEMi model using the combination of rotating non-regularised and moving regularised dipoles. Dipole modelling of single spikes characterises best-fit dipole location and orientation more reliably in BFEC than in MTLE for which spike averaging is recommended.

Our objectives were to assess operational feasibility, inter-operator variability, lot variability, device failure rate, and accuracy, to inform device modification for further field testing. The paper-based ALT test was performed at POC on fingerstick samples from 600 outpatients receiving HIV treatment in Vietnam. Results, read independently by two clinic nurses, were compared with gold-standard automated (Roche Cobas) results from venipuncture samples obtained in parallel. Two device lots were used sequentially. We demonstrated high <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement,</b> with 96. 3 % (95 % C.

40|$|PURPOSE : A planar multi-gated cardiac blood pool {{acquisition}} is a {{non-invasive technique}} {{commonly used to}} measure left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF). It is essential that the calculation of LVEF be accurate, repeatable and reproducible for serial monitoring of patients. Different processing modes {{may be used in}} calculating the LVEF which require various degrees of manipulation. In addition, different operators with varying levels of experience may process the same data set. It is not known whether the inter-operator variability of LVEF values within a single nuclear medicine department has the potential to affect the calculated LVEF and in turn affect patient management. The aim {{of the study was to}} determine variability of LVEF values among operators with different levels of experience using two processing modes. METHODS : A descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out in a single setting. Four operators with varying levels of experience analysed 120 left anterior oblique projections using manual and automatic processing modes to calculate the LVEF. Inter- and intra-operator correlation was determined. RESULTS : Manual processing showed moderate to strong agreement (r 1 = 0. 653) between operators. Automatic processing indicated almost perfect (r 1 = 0. 812) inter-operator correlation. Intra-operator correlation demonstrated a trend of decreasing variability between processing modes with increasing levels of experience. CONCLUSION : Despite the overall <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement,</b> significant intra-operator variability was evident in results from operators with less experience. However, the discrepancies were such that the differences in LVEF would not play a role in patient management. It is recommended that automatic processing be used for determining LVEF to limit inter-operator variability. Additionally operator experience should be considered in the absence of standardised processing protocols when different processing modes are available in a single setting. [URL]...|$|E

Although some clinical studies have highlighted the importance of foot conformation as a risk factor for musculoskeletal injury (Kane et al. 1998; Anderson et al. 2004), this has not been a universal finding (Weller et al. 2006 c). Clearly more information from large, well designed, prospective studies is needed to elucidate further the relationship between foot conformation and injury. This information would help to guide veterinary surgeons and farriers in the trimming and shoeing of horses’ feet, a practice carried out regularly (usually every 4 - 8 weeks) during the animal’s life. In order to further investigate this relationship, a tool capable of accurately, precisely and practicably collecting suitable objective data, ideally at relatively low cost, is necessary. The variability introduced by image acquisition and subsequent analysis using digital image processing software of digital photographs of the foot has not been quantified. Similarly the level of agreement between objective measurements of foot conformation made from digital photography and digital radiography is unknown. The objectives of this project were to assess the precision, accuracy and practicability of the entire process of obtaining measurements of horses’ feet using digital photography and the digital image processing software (Metron-PX™).

40|$|Diagnosis of {{leptospirosis}} by {{the gold}} standard serologic assay, the microscopic agglutination test (MAT), requires paired sera and is not widely available. We developed a rapid assay using immunodominant Leptospira immunoglobulin-like (Lig) proteins in a Dual Path Platform (DPP). This study aimed to evaluate the assay's diagnostic performance {{in the setting of}} urban transmission. METHODOLOGY: We determined test sensitivity using 446 acute and convalescent sera from MAT-confirmed case-patients with severe or mild leptospirosis in Brazil. We assessed test specificity using 677 sera from the following groups: healthy residents of a Brazilian slum with endemic transmission, febrile outpatients from the same slum, healthy blood donors, and patients with dengue, hepatitis A, and syphilis. Three operators independently interpreted visual results without knowing specimen status. RESULTS: The overall sensitivity for paired sera was 100 % and 73 % for severe and mild disease, respectively. In the acute phase, the assay achieved a sensitivity of 85 % and 64 % for severe and mild leptospirosis, respectively. Within seven days of illness onset, the assay achieved a sensitivity of 77 % for severe disease and 60 % for mild leptospirosis. Sensitivity of the DPP assay was similar to that for IgM-ELISA and increased with both duration of symptoms (chi-square regression Pâ€Š=â€Š 0. 002) and agglutinating titer (Spearman Ï â€Š=â€Š 0. 24, P< 0. 001). Specificity was â‰¥ 93 % for dengue, hepatitis A, syphilis, febrile outpatients, and blood donors, while it was 86 % for healthy slum residents. <b>Inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> ranged from very good to excellent (kappa: 0. 82 - 0. 94) and test-to-test reproducibility was also high (kappa: 0. 89). CONCLUSIONS: The DPP assay performed acceptably well for diagnosis of severe acute clinical leptospirosis and can be easily implemented in hospitals and health posts where leptospirosis is a major public health problem. However, test accuracy may need improvement for mild disease and early stage leptospirosis, particularly in regions with high transmission...|$|E
40|$|Question: Multi-temporal {{analysis}} of remotely sensed imagery {{has proven to}} be a powerful tool for assessment and monitoring of landscape diversity. Here the feasibility of assessing land-use diversity and land-use change was tested at multiple scales and over time by means of statistical linear estimators based on a probabilistic sampling design. Location: The study area (the district of Asciano, Tuscany, Italy) is characterized by erosional forms typical of Pliocene claystone (i. e. calanchi and biancane) that have been subject to the phenomenon of biancane reworking over the past 50 years, mainly owing to the expansion of intensive agriculture. Methods: Cells at two different scales (50 m × 50 m and 10 m × 10 m) were classified by two operators according to a multilevel legend, using 1954 and 2000 aerial photographs. <b>Inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> and accuracy were tested by Cohen's K coefficient. Total land cover estimation for each class was carried out using a multistage estimator, while the variance was estimated by means of the Wolter estimator. Field-based information on plant species composition was recorded in order to test for a relationship between land use and plant community composition by anova and indicator species analysis. Results: Agreement between photointerpreters and accuracy were significantly higher than those expected by chance, proving that the approach proposed is reproducible, as long as proper quality assurance methods are used. Our data show that, at the two scales considered (50 m × 50 m and 10 m × 10 m), crops have increased against woodlands and semi-natural areas, the latter showing the highest and significantly different mean species richness. Meanwhile, an increase in the coverage of trees and shrubs was found within the semi-natural areas, probably as a result of secondary succession occurring on typical landscape elements such as biancane. Conclusions: Inferential statistics made it possible to acquire quantitative information on the abundance of land cover classes, allowing formal multi-temporal and multi-scale analysis. Sampling design-based statistical linear estimators were found to be a powerful tool for assessing landscape trends considering both time expenditure and other costs. They make it possible to maintain the same scale of analysis over time series data and to detect both coarse- and fine-grained changes in spatial patterns...|$|E

40|$|Background: Ultrasound {{examination}} of the abdomen is often a first choice at radiology departments {{due to the lack}} of ionizing radiation. For diagnostic accuracy and economic benefits there has been a need for new routines in this area that incorporate the benefits of an radiographer or sonographer performing a multitude of ultrasound examinations following strictly standardized examination protocols and documentation forms made by cine-loops that will give the radiologist access to all relevant information needed for an accurate postexamination diagnosis. Aim: The overall objective of this thesis was to evaluate the diagnostic variability in examinations of the kidneys and liver that use a standardized ultrasound method along with video documentation of the entire examination and off-line review by radiologists. More specifically, we wanted to compare the agreement between readers and between operators. Design and method: This thesis is based on four quantitative studies using standardized protocols for kidney, liver and gallbladder examinations. In paper I, including 64 patients, and paper IV, including 98 patients, the patients were prospectively enrolled and the  examinations were retrospectively reviewed. The patients in papers I and IV were examined by one radiographer (sonographer) and one radiologist during the same session. In paper I, findings using the standardized ultrasound method were compared with traditional bedside assessments by a radiologist. In paper IV, the patients were examined using only the standardized method. In paper II, including 98 patients, and in paper III, including 115 patients, the patients were examined by one sonographer using the standardized method and the examinations were reviewed by two or three radiologists. Results: In paper I, no significant systematic differences were found between the findings using the standardized method and the traditional bedside assessment. Paper II showed good intra- and inter-observer agreement between three experienced radiologists when reviewing examinations conducted using the standardized method. In paper III we verified good inter-observer agreement between two radiologists reviewing ultrasound examinations using the standardized technique in patients who had undergone surgery for colorectal cancer. Intravenous contrast was used and the injection of contrast medium increased the visibility of liver lesions. In paper IV, we observed that using a standardized cine-loop technique, there was a slightly better <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> than inter-reader agreement. Conclusion: The satisfactory agreement shown in all four studies suggests that the new workflow method using standardized ultrasound examinations and stored cine-loops, performed by a radiographer or sonographer and analyzed off-line by a radiologist, is a promising technique. The results are less affected when a radiologist examiner is replaced by a radiographer or sonographer than when the reviewer is replaced by a different radiologist...|$|E
40|$|General aim The general {{objective}} of this thesis was to evaluate the clinical performance of two new methods for quantification of dental caries - the Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence method (QLF) and KaVo DIAGNOdent. Materials and methods In Paper I, in vivo measurements with QLF on teeth scheduled for extraction, were compared with transverse microradiography (TMR), and tested for intra-operator reliability. In Paper II, the QLF method was applied to monitor active white spot lesions {{over a period of}} 6 months in a randomised, controlled study. In Paper IV, the QLF method was tested for intra- and inter-operator reliability in vivo for the capturing part as well as the image analysis part of the method. In Paper III, KaVo DIAGNOdent and QLF were validated with TMR and histology for mineral loss and lesion depth. In Paper V, DIAGNOdent readings of occlusal surfaces were compared with visual inspection, and bitewing radiography, before validation by assessment of lesion depth. In a second part of the study, DIAGNOdent was validated with QLF as reference standard for assessment of lesion depth on smooth OBS surfaces. Intra- and inter-operator reliability were tested in both parts of the study. Validation: In vitro, both QLF and DIAGNOdent showed good correlation with lesion depth on smooth surfaces, while the QLF method showed higher correlation with mineral loss. Sensitivity and specificity were excellent for QLF and good for DIAGNOdent. In vivo, DIAGNOdent showed low sensitivity for deep dentinal caries on occlusal surfaces when balanced to acceptable specificity. Validated with QLF as reference standard, DIAGNOdent readings of smooth surfaces showed a satisfactory correlation OBS on. Reliability tests on smooth surfaces showed excellent results for both the QLF method and DIAGNOdent in terms of inter- and intra-operator agreement. For occlusal surfaces, DIAGNOdent showed a very good intra-operator agreement, and a good inter-operator and inter-device agreement. Clinical application: In Paper M data obtained by the QLF method showed significant differences over time in the test group (PTR + fluoride varnish) as well as the control group (PTR) regarding lesion area and average change in fluorescence. There was also a significant intergroup difference regarding average change in fluorescence and a tendency towards intergroup difference for lesion area. Despite the fact that the QLF method consists of several steps, both the inter- and intra- operator reliability were excellent. Measurements with the DIAGNOdent (one-step system) are easier to perform, and for operator agreement the results for both methods were excellent. However, because of its closer correlation with mineral content, QLF is the preferred method for scientific purposes such as monitoring de- or remineralisation. Conclusions 1) The Quantitative Light-induced Fluorescence method may be of value for longitudinal monitoring, e. g. for assessment of the effects of different caries preventive programmes and the method per se may further boost motivation and compliance by the subjects. 2) Under clinical conditions, the DIAGNOdent device showed excellent intra-operator agreement and good inter- operator agreement for measurements of carious lesions on smooth surfaces and good intra- and <b>inter-operator</b> <b>agreement</b> for lesions on occlusal surfaces. 3) With respect to clinical cut-off thresholds for dentinal caries on occlusal surfaces, no definite recommendations for DIAGNOdent could be {{made on the basis of}} data obtained in these studies...|$|E
