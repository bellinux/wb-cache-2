500|$|... "Gimme More" [...] {{has been}} covered by many artists {{and a great}} number of amateurs. In late 2007, American singer-songwriter Marié Digby posted an {{acoustic}} cover of [...] "Gimme More" [...] along with a cover of Rihanna's [...] "Umbrella" [...] in her YouTube account. Both became viral hits, with [...] "Gimme More" [...] gaining more than 300,000 views in two weeks. Shortly after, Digby became the eighth most subscribed-to artist on YouTube. She joked about the situation saying, [...] "I could have done a karaoke video to , but I just had my stripper pole taken out the other day from my living room, and it just wouldn't have been the same". The same year, Australian pop singer Sia released an acoustic version of the song. Swedish metal band Machinae Supremacy covered the song on their third studio album Overworld, released on February 13, 2008. Matthieu De Ronde of Archaic Magazine commented [...] " [...] one of the most unexpected covers of all time, [...] this track has been given a somewhat comical but enjoyable makeover, but who said that metal couldn’t be fun?". American singer-songwriter Christopher Dallman played a cover of the song during many of his concerts in 2007. Two years later, he showed his version to his producer Rachel Alina, who prompted him to release an EP of Spears's covers. The EP, titled Sad Britney, was released on November 9, 2009, and also contained covers of [...] "Radar", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "...Baby One More Time". It became Dallman's first record to chart on iTunes. He also released a music video for [...] "Gimme More", which was criticized by Spears's fans who thought Dallman was making <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> He explained, [...] "There have been a few folks who have misinterpreted what I was doing and thought that I was somehow making <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her,</b> which really isn’t the case.

500|$|When Powell was 17, {{her father}} died after a long battle with lung cancer. Before he died, he told her {{she would have to}} get a job to support her mother, and {{would not be able to}} go to art school. As her mother wanted her to receive an education, she rented out a room to four {{apprentice}} electricians. In September 1957, Powell gained a place at the Liverpool College of Art. Although studying graphics, she also took lettering classes, as did Lennon. He never had any drawing tools with him, so he constantly borrowed pens and pencils from Powell, who discovered he was only there because other teachers had refused to instruct him. She had an air of respectability and moved in different social circles than her future husband. Lennon and an art school friend, Geoff Mohammed, used to make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> by stopping the conversation when she walked in the room, saying: [...] "Quiet please!

500|$|Other reviews {{were also}} positive; Sal Cinquemani form Slant Magazine {{suggested}} that [...] "The Fear" [...] is {{proof of the}} pop singer's self-awareness, but, given her own personal tabloid history, the song possesses a trail of irony: [...] "I'll look at The Sun and I'll look in The Mirror/I'm on the right track, yeah, we're onto a winner." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly liked the song, in which Allen makes <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> own material-girl ID {{and went on to}} say that it is in fact [...] "a tale of two Lilys: the naughty postadolescent in the rearview mirror, and the fully realized female coming around the bend."

Leslie later fondly tells the documentary crew that she and Mark made love five years ago, but Mark only vaguely recalls the encounter. Leslie, Tom and uninterested intern April Ludgate (Aubrey Plaza) visit Ann and meet Andy, a lazy and demanding musician whom she is forced to wait on and support financially. Afterward, Leslie and Ann visit the pit, which Leslie accidentally falls into as Tom and April make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> Ann quickly provides medical assistance. Afterward, Leslie leaves, and Ann tells the documentary crew, [...] "She's a little doofy, but she's sweet". Some time later, Leslie asks her boss Ron Swanson (Nick Offerman) for permission to form an exploratory committee for the pit project. Ron initially refuses, but eventually agrees to consider it so that Leslie will leave his office. Ron explains {{that he does not}} want the Parks Department to build any parks because he believes government is a waste of money, and that all government should be privatized and run by corporations for profit. Leslie repeatedly pesters Ron about the park project, but he refuses to commit.|$|E

On the April 23 episode of SmackDown!, McCool and Layla defeated Beth Phoenix and Mickie James, and attacked Phoenix with hairspray and a table.

In addition, she continues habits she picked up in prison, and beats up the kids who make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> at school (specifically Connie D'Amico and her friends {{with a bag of}} full soda cans which she hits them with, cracking three of the popular kids' skulls open and tongue-kissing Connie afterwards) for which she is suspended.

Brian, however, shows her the article he wrote, in which he describes her [...] "far sweeter and kinder" [...] than the typical American girl. Touched by the fact that Brian actually cares for her just as she was, Meg changes her mind and returns home with Brian; having changed back her normal personality in the process. Back at home, she makes a bad joke involving Wesley Snipes, and Peter, presumably not amused at this, ends the episode by saying [...] "Always end on a strong joke".|$|E

[...] Chad Presley from Blogcritics felt that, [...] "There's {{a healthy dose of}} nostalgia involved in watching these videos for anyone who grew up during the 1980s in particular. [...] The video quality is a mixed bag. Most of the visual problems crop up during the earlier clips, which were photographed on much more primitive equipment. [...] All things considered, especially when viewed on a Blu-ray player and hi-def TV, this is a pretty rough looking set. Even some of the later videos have an excess of visual noise and are lacking in sharpness." [...] Ian Sturges from Daily Mirror commented, [...] "Celebration is a journey [...] from coquettish wannabe to pop goddess to institution. [...] The videos parallel this transformation from her innocent cavorting on a Venetian gondola for 'Like a Virgin' to the determinedly X-rated couplings of 'Justify My Love' and 'Erotica', both of which were banned. Monica Herrera from Billboard was not impressed with the collection and was disappointed with the [...] "dull quality of the videos. The collection is a probable shame in Madonna's catalogue, but a great one for her fans." [...] Bönz Malone from Spin said, [...] "Celebration: The Video Collection is a reminder that Madonna is, and always will be, a true video artist.

500|$|Although Monica and Rachel have {{remained}} best friends since high school, {{they are very}} much opposites. While both characters share similar economic backgrounds, they grew up on [...] "different ends {{of the high school}} social order," [...] with Rachel being a popular cheerleader and Monica [...] "deal with body and control issues due to being an overweight child and teen." [...] Sabienna Bowman of This Was TV observed that [...] "Monica’s struggles ultimately left her more confident than Rachel, as well as more prepared for adulthood." [...] Among her defining qualities, Monica has had a passion for cooking ever since childhood, stemming from when she received her first Easy-Bake Oven. A chef, the character has had several cooking-related jobs throughout the series, having worked at five different restaurants, a trend that nearly coincides with her constant rotation of boyfriends in an ongoing search for the [...] "perfect match". Michael Hogan of The Guardian believes that the character's [...] "competitive, perfectionist, obsessive-compulsive nature made her ideally suited to a career as a chef." [...] However, her love of cooking and food is also responsible for her having been extremely overweight as a child, throughout high school and college. The running gag of an overweight Monica is often used as a recurring backstory for the character throughout the series, first explored in the second-season episode [...] "The One With the Prom Video" [...] via flashback. One of the character's childhood nicknames was [...] "Big Fat Goalie" [...] when she played field hockey. While overweight, Monica is depicted as having very low self-esteem, binge eating often, and constantly seeking attention. While in college, Monica is embarrassed into losing weight permanently after overhearing her then-crush Chandler make <b>fun</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> appearance. Media and the Rhetoric of Body Perfection: Cosmetic Surgery, Weight Loss and Beauty in Popular Culture author Dr. Deborah Harris-Moore believes that Monica's tendency to come off as a control freak originates from her childhood struggles with weight gain, explaining that the character ate excessively in order [...] "to cope with her emotions." ...|$|E

The next section, inspired by the style and culture of early 1980s New York, began with Madonna skipping on stage for [...] "Into the Groove". This performance was a mashup with [...] "Toop Toop" [...] by Cassius and featured the artwork of friend Keith Haring. She then performed a double Dutch dance interlude which led to [...] "Heartbeat". During that song, Madonna's dance movements were controlled by her back-up dancers as if they were puppeteers.
