25|$|Neilson also {{pushed the}} {{envelope}} causing several rules to be rewritten. During one Petes game, {{his team was}} up one goal, but was down two men in a five on three situation for the last minute of the game. Realizing that more penalties could not be called under the existing rules, Neilson put too many men on the ice every ten seconds. The referees stopped the play and a faceoff was held relieving pressure on the defence. After this display the rule was changed so that a call <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> men on the ice in a 5 on 3 situation now leads to a penalty shot.|$|E
25|$|Against Philadelphia, Ryan Callahan {{scored a}} goal to earn his 200th career point, but {{suffered}} a left shoulder subluxation during a third period fight with Maxime Talbot, an injury that was expected to make him miss up to 14 days. The Flyers only goal came on the power play shortly after Callahan left, raising concerns about how his absence would affect the Ranger's penalty killing and defensive forward play. The Rangers ended the month with a 0–3 loss to the Pittsburgh Penguins on January 31, the team's first shutout loss in 31 regular season games. New York failed to score on four power plays without Callahan and surrendered seven penalties, including their fourth penalty <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> men on the ice in seven games, {{the most of any}} team in the league.|$|E
25|$|The Rangers {{defeated}} the Tampa Bay Lightning 5–1 on February 10, {{and beat the}} Boston Bruins in overtime on February 12. Boston tied game with a three-goal rally in the third period, including two goals in 91 seconds with the goaltender pulled, but Callahan made the game-winning shootout goal in the fourth round. During that game, the Rangers received their sixth penalty of the season <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> men on the ice, {{the most of any}} team in the league. They lost 3–4 in overtime against the New York Islanders on February 14, surrendering a 0–2 lead after the Islanders scored three goals in seven minutes during the second period. Hagelin scored his fourth goal in three games to tie the game, but they lost in an overtime shootout when Gaborik's and Nash's shots were stopped. The Rangers beat the Washington Capitals 2–1 on February 17, bringing New York to seventh place and putting them in playoff contention for the first time all season.|$|E

25|$|The Penguins won game three, 4–2, {{cutting their}} {{deficit in the}} series in half. Pittsburgh {{got off to a}} strong {{offensive}} start and scored first at 4:48 of the opening period when Evgeni Malkin set up Max Talbot, who fired a one-timed snapshot. Detroit answered less than two minutes later with a Henrik Zetterberg goal at 6:19 in the period. Zetterberg scored on a rebound after Ville Leino's wrap-around attempt was stopped by Marc-Andre Fleury. After Pittsburgh's Brooks Orpik was called for interference, Johan Franzen responding by scoring a goal at 11:33 with under ten seconds left in the penalty. Franzen's score was a one-timer that resulted after Zetterberg fed him a pass around the goal crease. While Detroit dominated the middle of the first period, at one point firing nine straight shots, the Penguins caught a break when the officials missed a penalty <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> men when Pittsburgh had inadvertently created their own powerplay, and played with six men for nearly thirty seconds. Pittsburgh then used a late holding call on Dan Cleary to set up a game tying power play goal. Defenceman Kris Letang fanned on a one-time attempt as he took a pass from Malkin, but regained control of the puck and fired a wrist shot into the net.|$|E

500|$|In {{the course}} of her career Wilkinson contributed to reforms in {{numerous}} policy areas: women's equal suffrage, women civil servants' equal pay, provision of air raid shelters for city dwellers, and protection of hire purchase borrowers' rights. The historian David Kynaston cites as her greatest practical achievement her success in meeting the timetable for the raising of the school leaving age; her successor as education minister, George Tomlinson, recorded how hard she had fought to avoid postponement of the reform, and expressed his sorrow that she died before the set date. Wilkinson was sometimes criticised for extending her efforts too widely; a local newspaper, the North Mail, complained in May 1937 that [...] "Miss Wilkinson is working <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> causes to do justice to Jarrow". Nevertheless, her book The Town that was Murdered brought to public notice the plight of Jarrow and the broader consequences of unbridled capitalism on working-class communities; the book, Harrison observes, [...] "educated the nation".|$|E
500|$|Development of the game's title {{screen was}} {{inspired}} by loading screens {{that were used in}} most computer games at the time; the objective was to create a nice-looking graphic while waiting for the game to load, even though the NES, more rooted in arcade traditions, did not require that. Pickford spent most of his character space on the title screen image; he was limited in the number of available colors due to the more limited graphic capabilities of the NES (as opposed to most home computers), as it was more designed for scrolling and animation and not for stationary graphics. The sword in the title screen used character sprites and used a different palette from the picture of Kuros himself; the sword had to be vertical as the NES hardware did not allow <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> sprites horizontally. Pickford planned to use, and completed, an Ironsword logo of his own when Acclaim made him use their planned logo, which he said [...] "was a bit more bland and blocky, with detail that didn't work very well at such a low pixel resolution".|$|E

[...] Policy areas she intended to focus on included improvements in employment, housing, and public services, which she said were [...] "prevented <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> by wealth being held {{in the hands of}} a minority." [...] She also spoke of reaching out to people she claimed had [...] "abandoned hope in Labour" [...] or voted for independence, and said that the party needed to [...] "take a new path" [...] because people wanted social and economic change, which previous Labour governments had not delivered. Among the policies she supported were renationalisation of the railways, introducing free childcare for children over the age of twelve months, introducing a living wage, and the abolition of both the Trident programme and student tuition fees. She also claimed that Labour in Scotland had [...] "been taken to the political abyss" [...] by [...] "New Labour and its architects". She claimed that Labour would find it harder to be re-elected unless she was chosen as its deputy leader.|$|E
500|$|There were genuine {{differences}} of opinion over policy between MacArthur and the Truman administration. One was MacArthur's deep-seated belief {{that it was not}} possible to separate the struggle against Communism in Europe from that going on in Asia. This was seen as the result of being stationed <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> years in the Orient, and of his perspective as a theater commander responsible only for part of the Far East. Another important policy difference was MacArthur's belief that China was not, as Acheson maintained, [...] "the Soviet Union's largest and most important satellite," [...] but an independent state with its own agenda that, in MacArthur's words, [...] "for its own purposes is [...] allied with Soviet Russia." [...] If MacArthur's thesis was accepted, then it followed that expanding the war with China would not provoke a conflict with the Soviet Union. The Joint Chiefs emphatically disagreed, although this contradicted their position that it was Europe and not Asia that was the prime concern of the Soviet Union. Even among Republicans, there was little support for MacArthur's position.|$|E
500|$|Stage 9 was {{the first}} major {{mountain}} stage, featuring two ascents of Mount Etna, including a summit finish. It was on this day that strong overall favorite Alberto Contador first seized control of the race. Just after 's José Rujano attacked out of the leading group on the road on the way up to Etna for the last time, Contador did likewise. Rujano struggled mightily to hold Contador's wheel and no one else came close to reaching the pair. Contador won the stage, his first Giro stage win despite having won the Italian Grand Tour in 2008, and immediately attained a minute's advantage in the overall classification. In his five previous Grand Tour wins, Contador had never lost the race lead after taking it, but he had also never taken it so early on in the race. As teams who have riders with a legitimate chance to win a race overall will generally try to avoid defending the lead <b>for</b> <b>too</b> <b>many</b> days, lest they tire their support riders out early and leave their leader vulnerable, there was speculation that Contador would tactically relinquish the jersey. The Spaniard himself hinted that such a move would be in his plans. This would be likeliest to happen in the heavily undulating stage 11. The breakaway group for this stage was hard-fought and late-forming, since someone from its number could potentially become the new race leader. While 's Christophe Le Mével, who entered the day third overall and had on two other occasions come within a time bonus of claiming the jersey, made the group, neither he nor anyone in it was destined to take pink. Largely under the impetus of Michele Scarponi's [...] team, the breakaway group was caught before the finish. Contador {{and the rest of the}} overall favorites finished at the front of the race, with riders well down in the standings claiming the time bonuses, meaning Contador retained the race leadership after all.|$|E
