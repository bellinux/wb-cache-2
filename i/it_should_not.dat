5|$|In the Prose Edda book Skáldskaparmál (chapter 57), the god Bragi {{explains}} {{the origin of}} poetry.

When they left, the gods decided that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be poured out, but rather kept {{as a symbol of}} their peace, and so from the contents made a man, Kvasir.

5|$|Later botanists, such as Philip Miller in 1754, divided cacti {{into several}} genera, which, in 1789, Antoine Laurent de Jussieu placed in his newly created family Cactaceae. By the early 20th century, botanists came to feel Linnaeus's name Cactus {{had become so}} {{confused}} as to its meaning (was it the genus or the family?) that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> {{be used as a}} genus name. The 1905 Vienna botanical congress rejected the name Cactus and instead declared Mammillaria was the type genus of the family Cactaceae. It did, however, conserve the name Cactaceae, leading to the unusual situation in which the family Cactaceae no longer contains the genus after which it was named.|$|E

As a result, Epic took legal action against MCA which forced the album's withdrawal. During its curtailed release, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial reached number 82 on the UK Albums Chart. It was well-received critically and won Jackson a Grammy Award for Best Recording for Children.|$|E

5|$|The {{rescue of}} Bat 21 was a {{watershed}} {{event for the}} military and led them {{to find a new}} approach to high-threat search and rescue. They recognized that, if a SAR mission was predestined to fail, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be attempted, and other options, such as special operations, diversionary tactics and other creative approaches tailored to the situation, had to be considered. Recognizing the need for an aircraft that could deliver better close air support, the Air Force accepted the Navy's A-7 Corsair. The military also improved the night capability of helicopters and area denial munitions.|$|E

5|$|While Allied naval {{authorities}} {{were aware of}} the approach of the German strike force and were successful in sinking two of the four submarines dispatched, efforts to locate and sink U-862 once she reached Australian waters were continually hampered by a lack of suitable ships and aircraft and a lack of personnel trained and experienced in anti-submarine warfare. As the southern coast of Australia was thousands of kilometres behind the active combat front in South-East Asia and had not been raided for several years, <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be considered surprising that few anti-submarine assets were available in this area in late 1944 and early 1945.|$|E
5|$|After filming commenced, Paramount Pictures {{brought in}} two African-American {{consultants}} {{to review and}} approve the depiction of the black characters: Willis Edwards, {{vice president of the}} local NAACP chapter, and David L. Crippens, the vice president and stage manager of the local PBS affiliate. In the end, they walked away with different views of the film. Crippens did not find the film to have any racist connotations, while Edwards found it inflammatory and felt <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> have been made, particularly not during that year, when a series of murders of black children was occurring in Atlanta. The two men provided a write-up of their views for the studio executives, which were passed to Davison along with warnings that the studio feared a film boycott. But Fuller was neither told of these discussions, nor given the notes, until two weeks before filming was slated to conclude. Known for being a staunch integrationist and for his regularly giving black actors non-stereotypical roles, Fuller was furious, finding the studio's actions insulting. He reportedly had both representatives banned from the set afterwards, though he did integrate some of the suggested changes into the film.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Ralph d'Escures in October 1122, King Henry I decided to allow a free election, with the new primate to be chosen by the leading men of the realm, both ecclesiastical and secular. The monks of the cathedral chapter and the bishops of the kingdom {{disagreed}} on who should be appointed. The bishops insisted that <b>it</b> <b>should</b> <b>not</b> be a clerk (a non-monastic member of the clergy), but Canterbury's monastic cathedral chapter preferred a monk, and insisted that they alone {{had the right to}} elect the archbishop. However, only two bishops in England or Normandy were monks (Ernulf, Bishop of Rochester, and Serlo, Bishop of Séez), and no monks other than Anselm of Canterbury, Ernulf, and Ralph d'Escures, had been elected to an English or Norman see since 1091; recent precedent therefore favoured a clerk. King Henry sided with the bishops, and told the monks that they could elect their choice from a short list selected by the bishops. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the list contained no monks.|$|E
