Two kinds of transitions induced by pressure are studied theoretically within a unified picture presented for both two types of heavy-fermion systems. Among these transitions, the incoherence-to-coherence transition in the electron-type heavy-fermion system is confirmed intensively in experiments, while the coherence-to-incoherence transition in the <b>hole-type</b> heavy-fermion system is discussed as a prediction for further observations...|$|E
40|$|The {{extremely}} large non-saturated magnetoresistance is {{an unusual}} property of many semimetals, {{some of which have}} topological quantum states. In the present paper, the non-stoichiometry effect on the magnetoresistance is systematically investigated for the Weyl semimetal WTe 2. The as-grown samples have a slight difference in Te vacancies, whose magnetoresistance and Hall resistivity are measured and analyzed with a two-carrier model. The fitting results show that the extreme magnetoresistance is strongly dependent on the residual resistivity ratio, which is interpreted as the degree of non-stoichiometry and the ratio of electron-type and <b>hole-type</b> carriers. Such an electron-hole compensation mechanism is further confirmed by the measurements on the annealed samples with artificial Te vacancies. The non-stoichiometry effect is eventually understood in terms of electron doping which breaks the balance between electron-type and <b>hole-type</b> carriers. These facts demonstrate that the compensation effect is the dominant mechanism of the extreme magnetoresistance in WTe 2, in spite of other possible origins...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the influence of}} static electric field on the transport properties in La 0. 7 Ce 0. 3 MnO 3 epitaxial thin films by using a simple field effect configuration (FEC), which was formed on a single layer film. Substrates act as gates and films as channels. Such an easily manipulative technique avoids many possible problems appeared in multilayer structures, such as poor interface and severe inter-diffusion, which may influence the intrinsic characteristics of investigated targets. One knows that tetravalence-doped La 0. 7 Ce 0. 3 MnO 3 (LEMO) systems exhibit metal-insulator transition and ferromagnetic behavior, similar to the ditravalence-doped La 0. 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3. However, for the conductive mechanism of LEMO, strong controversies have existed {{for a long time}} with whether it is intrinsically electron-type or <b>hole-type.</b> Our experiments give evidence of the <b>hole-type</b> nature in LEMO. In the device with LEMO as channel and LaAlO 3 (LAO) as gate, applied positive bias poles gate and induces charge at the area between gate and channel. The polarized charge in the gate is compensated by inducing electrons in the channel. If LEMO is of electron-type, the increased carrier density would cause a decease of channel resistance. However, we experimentally found the channel resistance remarkably increases upon a positive bias. Such a fact is completely the same as the behavior observed in hole-doped La 0 7 Ca 0. 3 MnO 3 channel, and thus strongly supports the <b>hole-type</b> nature in LEMO channel. Furthermore, we found that the large field effect in LEMO is nonlinear and polarity dependent on the applied bias. A percolative phase separation picture is taking into account to interpret the observed field effect. published_or_final_versio...|$|E

40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experimental}} observation of an hydrostatic pressure induced transition from semiconductor to semimetal in black phosphorus [Chen et al. in arXiv: 1504. 00125], we present the first principles calculation on the pressure {{effect of the}} electronic structures of black phosphorus. It is found that the band crossover and reversal at the Z point occur around the critical pressure Pc 1 = 1. 23 Gpa, and the band inversion evolves into 4 twofold-degenerate Dirac cones around the Z point, suggesting a 3 D Dirac semimetal. With further increasing pressure the Dirac cones in the Gamma-Z line move toward the Gamma point and evolve into two <b>hole-type</b> Fermi pockets, {{and those in the}} Z-M lines move toward the M point and evolve into 2 <b>hole-type</b> Fermi pockets up to P= 4. 0 Gpa. It demonstrates clearly that the Lifshitz transition occurs at $P_{c 1 }$ from semiconductor to 3 D Dirac semimetal protected by the nonsymmorphic space symmetry of bulk. This suggests the bright perspective of black phosphorus for optoelectronic and electronic devices due to its easy modulation by pressure. Comment: 7 pages, 9 figures, and 2 table...|$|E

By first-principles calculations, here we show that additional degeneracy exists for the two electron-type FS, and the crucial role of F-doping and pressure is to enhance this orbital degeneracy.

The present {{study focused on}} the dynamic elimination of the Cl− secretory capacity and illustrated different phases (i. e., acute and regulatory phases) of branchial MR cells in response to hypoosmotic challenge. Time-course remodeling of the cell surfaces and the altered expressions of typical ion transporters were observed in the branchial MR cells of SW-acclimated brackish medaka (Oryzias dancena) when exposed to fresh water (FW). On the 1 st day post-transfer, rapid changes were shown in the acute phase: the flat-type MR cells with large apical surfaces replaced the <b>hole-type</b> cells, the gene expression of both Odnkcc 1 a and Odcftr decreased, and the apical immunostaining signals of CFTR protein disappeared. The basolateral immunostaining signals of NKCC 1 a protein decreased throughout the regulatory phase (> 1 day post-transfer). During this period, the size and number of NKA-immunoreactive MR cells were significantly reduced and elevated, respectively. Branchial NKA expression and activity were maintained at constant levels in both phases. The results revealed that when SW-acclimated brackish medaka were transferred to hypoosmotic FW for 24 h, the Cl− secretory capacity of MR cells was eliminated, whereas NKCC 1 a protein was retained to maintain the hypoosmoregulatory endurance of the gills.
