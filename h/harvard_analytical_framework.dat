The new <b>analytical</b> <b>framework</b> is devised by segregating the entirety of a state’s foreign military relations into four categories according to their distinctive subject matters.

It contends that Turkish-Chinese relations have yet to develop to levels envisaged and aimed at by policymakers and scholars from the two sides. It probes the causes that have thus far hindered the development of political, economic, military, and social and cultural relations between Turkey and China in separate and consecutive sections.

It also identifies the benefits that are realized from each activity, and who has access to and control over these benefits. The final Influencing factors section identifies factors that cause the differences of roles of each gender identified in the two profiles. These may indicate areas where there is opportunity to change gender roles.A project using the framework will have identification, design, implementation and evaluation stages. The framework also provides a series of checklists, questions to be asked at each stage.|$|E

A Women’s Equality and Empowerment Framework (WEEF) {{analysis of the}} WVV country programme provided a visual overview of the programme, demonstrating that the organisation has a strong concern for women’s issues and were encouraging women’s empowerment. The programme could be improved by engaging in more conscientisation around gender issues. The <b>Harvard</b> <b>Analytical</b> <b>Framework</b> collected rich data on {{men and women in}} the communities and helped project staff to get to know the communities better. It also questioned the effectiveness of projects in dealing with gender issues, WVV need to provide equal opportunities for women at the project management level. The Gender Analysis Matrix (GAM) clearly showed project impacts for both men and women. One of the literacy projects had greatly benefited women, but could be improved by running separate classes for the men. The GAM results are not restricted to gender issues; the tool shows potential as a general monitoring framework. Experienced facilitators are needed to get the most out of the frameworks, however anyone can greatly benefit from utilising these tools. No GA framework can replace an awareness of gender issues and the will to work towards a fairer society. GA frameworks that are designed to empower the participants can deliberately or inadvertently be used in an extractive way, while frameworks that are labelled as extractive can be used creatively to empower those who take part. GA sessions provide rich data on gender in a relatively short period of time. While they risk not collecting enough information, the systematic collection and use of some information should help move development work forward...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates women's {{economic}} empowerment {{in relation to}} micro'credit schemes in southern Nigeria. The study also evaluates the benefits and limitations of micro'credit as a resourceful means of enhancing women's economic activities in the labour market and eliminating poverty among market and rural women. Micro'credit schemes and institutions which provide soft loans to women have become a critical tool in development programmes aiming to empower them. The Nigerian government (both at Federal and State levels) has pursued this development trend since 1985 and today, {{it is estimated that}} an increasing number of Nigerian women participate in these schemes. Besides, it is widely accepted among development practitioners that micro'credit schemes not only contribute to poverty reduction but also empower the have'nots. My research design has drawn on gender analytical frameworks such as the 1980 <b>Harvard</b> <b>Analytical</b> <b>Framework,</b> Kabeer's 1998 Women's Empowerment Assessment, and Mayoux' 2001 micro'credit empowerment paradigm. This study employed as its methodology, ethnographic field research. This includes semi'structured interviews and participant observation. In addition, data was obtained from state databases, archives and development websites. Throughout, both qualitative and quantitative methods and analysis were used. This study found that women in southern Nigeria are extensively engaged in economic activities. It also established that micro'credit provides finance to enhance market and rural women's participation in production and trade. The study further ascertains that women have some control over their loans. However, increased economic activities may have also increased participants' financial responsibilities and household decision'making is still a prerogative of male head of the family. In addition, this study found that older married women in this region enjoy a comparatively high degree of personal mobility, but restrictions on travel in terms of distance and time are very common for younger married women. These restrictions are sanctioned by customs, household obligations, and social infrastructures. While problems with the transportation network have enhanced the middlemen's domination of economic activities in this region they increased women's dependence on their services. All this renders empowerment for women more difficult to achieve although it makes a practical contribution to their everyday lives...|$|E
40|$|Many {{development}} {{policies have}} been implemented {{with a focus on}} practical gender needs to improve women's lives in Bangladesh. However, these programmes have paid little attention to implementing women's strategic gender needs and consequently have failed to bring significant changes to poverty and malnutrition among rural women in Bangladesh. As an extension of economic development programmes the Grameen Bank micro-credit institution in Bangladesh provides credit to the rural poor, particularly women. It operates in {{more than half of the}} villages through loans disbursement to 2. 3 million members of whom 95 percent are women. The question to be raised is to what extent does the Grameen Bank credit scheme generate women's income activities with the prospect of empowering them against poverty and malnutrition. The major concern of my Ph. D. research is to examine the impact of Grameen Bank credit on empowering rural women socially and economically which, in turn, improves women's health and nutrition. The theoretical frameworks used for assessing the impact of credit activities on empowering women are drawn from the <b>Harvard</b> <b>Analytical</b> <b>Framework</b> (1980), Longwe's (1994) Women's Empowerment Assessment Framework, and Kabeer's (1998), using indicators to assess women's empowerment. The five specific dimensions are: (1) women's economic activities, (2) women's control over income, (3) access to and control over productive resources, (4) women's freedom of mobility, and (5) market access, all of which have been adapted and used to assess women's empowerment through credit activities. My research methodology consists of ethnographic field research, including in-depth interviews of women's experiences, participant observations and focus group discussion. I employ both qualitative and quantitative analysis of the data, which was collected from December 1999 to April 2000. Two groups of women are considered in this study, those who were involved in the Grameen Bank credit activities, and those who did not access Grameen credit. A total of 144 participants, including Muslim and Hindu backgrounds and Grameen Bank staff, were involved in the study. The study found the majority of women have no control over their loans. Women hand over their loans to male family members to invest in more profitable male-dominated economic activities, beyond the domestic sphere. The result is that women have no say or little say in how their loan money is to be used and for what purposes. In addition, women who invest their loans in traditional female economic activities depend largely on males for marketing their products. It is also found that although women take loans, provide more energy and time, and bear the burden of re-payment, it is men who use their prevailing traditional power to buy productive assets in their own name and under their control. For the majority of women their lives have become more vulnerable and have slipped into deeper poverty and malnutrition. Factors such as women's restricted mobility, lack of market access, and rigid gender cultural practices are major obstacles to women's empowerment through credit activities. The study also found only a small minority of women have benefited from the Grameen micro-credit scheme. These women are mostly Hindu low caste widows, who have had market access and became involved in the production and management of male-managed economic activities. These activities increase women's negotiation skills, widen their knowledge and market information and enhance their courage and self-confidence in challenging patriarchal social structures in their community. In general, there are no significant differences between Grameen and non-Grameen Bank women in terms of control over income, market access, and control over productive assets. The nutritional status of women is assessed using: (a) body mass index, (b) food frequency questionnaire, and (c) 3 -day food consumption patterns. Nutritional adequacy and deficiency are assessed and compared with recommended dietary allowances in Bangladesh. Most of the Grameen Bank women are nutritionally deficient compared to non-Grameen women. Grameen Bank women's heavy workload and debt burden, lack of control over income and expenditure combined with gender disparity in household resource allocation, are viewed as critical in negatively impacting on women's health and nutritional status. The computer programme Epinfo version 6, Microsoft Excel, Microsoft Word and Nutrition programmes were used to analyse data.

40|$|Abstract: Land tenure systems, {{especially}} in Sri Lanka {{and many other}} developing countries in Asia and Africa are very complex. This complexity has arisen from complex relations between man, land, and organizations. These relations are mainly based on different institutions. However, in most cases, consistencies between these institutions are poor. This results in ineffi cient tenure system which in turn brings tenure insecurity, low productivity, resource degradations, etc. The main objective of the paper is to develop an <b>analytical</b> <b>framework</b> to study the institutional character of land tenure system so as to reduce the institutional inconsistencies and thus to form an effective land tenure system. Accordingly, based on a thorough literature review and fi eld experiences, the paper has developed an <b>analytical</b> <b>framework</b> to study the land tenure relations and institutions involved in them. The <b>analytical</b> <b>framework</b> also describes the interdependent nature between property rights and other institutions within a land tenure system and their contribution towards {{the development of a}} coherent land tenure system. By using the <b>analytical</b> <b>framework</b> the paper has analyzed the land tenure system in Sri Lanka. For this purpose the case study method was adopted. The outcomes show that failure of the land tenure system is mainly caused by institutional ineffi ciencies. Further, this paper discovers that a well developed institutional <b>analytical</b> <b>framework</b> can be used to identify the institutional inconsistencies within a land tenure system. Thus, it can be an effective tool in land policy making...|$|R
