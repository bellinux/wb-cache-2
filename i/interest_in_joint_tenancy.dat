50|$|The more {{important}} tax {{aspect of a}} transmutation agreement is the effect that it has on basis step-up (or step-down) at death.

40|$|For many years, {{attorneys}} and estate planners have been cautious of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> where substantial wealth is involved. A jointly owned estate poses {{a number of}} tax problems and ownership difficulties which often frustrate {{the intentions of the}} creator. The primary advantage of holding property <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> is that the cost and publicity of probate are avoided. To secure this benefit, the owner loses many rights to the property and may suffer disastrous tax consequences. Basically, the use of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> prevents the contributing tenant from efficiently planning the disposition of his property. If he should die first, the surviving tenant has uncontrolled power over the property. Thus, the property may be diverted from the contributing tenant 2 ̆ 7 s intended beneficiaries. The second major objection to the creation of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies</b> is the adverse estate tax consequences which may result. If the contributing tenant dies first, the entire value of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> will be included in his estate and probably taxed again in the estate of the surviving joint tenant. Because many potential tax and nontax disadvantages of joint ownership may be alleviated through a proper severance of the <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> this article discusses the voluntary and involuntary acts which will constitute a severance of real and personal property in Nebraska...|$|R
5000|$|A {{jointure}} is of two kinds, {{legal and}} equitable. A legal jointure was first {{authorized by the}} Statute of Uses. Before this statute a husband had no legal seisin in such lands as were vested in another to his [...] "use", but merely an equitable estate. Consequently, it was usual to make settlements on marriage, the most general form being the settlement by deed of an estate {{to the use of}} the husband and wife for their lives <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> (or [...] "jointure") so that the whole would go to the survivor. Although, strictly speaking, a jointure is a joint estate limited to both husband and wife, in common acceptation the word extends also to a sole estate limited to the wife only.|$|R
5000|$|Realty, or {{heritable}} property, on {{the other}} hand, was originally inherited <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> termed gavelkind, and {{passed on to the}} kin group as a whole. However, after the household superseded the kin group in importance in the late Middle Ages, preference was given to the deceased's immediate family, specifically any surviving sons, and none could be favored over his siblings. However, gavelkind inheritance gave rise to inter-family rivalries, so primogeniture laws arose in some areas of feudal Europe giving preference to the eldest son in order to stem feuding. Nevertheless, under medieval communal society, family land could not be sold except for cause, and the family essentially had a right of first refusal (laudatio parentum) in any such sale; in some places, this restriction also applied to gifts.|$|R

50|$|A {{concurrent}} estate or co-tenancy {{is a concept}} in property law which describes the various ways in which property is owned {{by more than one}} person at a time. If more than one person owns the same property, they are referred to as co-owners. If more than one person leases the same property, they are called co-tenants or joint tenants. Most common law jurisdictions recognize <b>tenancies</b> <b>in</b> common and <b>joint</b> <b>tenancies,</b> and some also recognize tenancies by the entirety. Many jurisdictions refer to a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as a <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with right of survivorship, and a few U.S. states treat the phrase <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> as synonymous with a tenancy in common.|$|R

40|$|It’s been a perplexing {{problem for}} years {{but it seems}} to be {{increasing}} as more of the situations come to light – years ago, grandparents conveyed property owned <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> (or tenancy by the entirety) to an irrevocable inter vivos trust with retained life estates for each of the grandparents and with a remainder interest to the children. As a variation, the grandparents in setting up the trust gave life estates to the children with a remainder interest to grandchildren. The grandparents are now deceased and the questions are two fold – (1) what is included in the gross estates of each of the grandparents and (2) what is the basis {{in the hands of the}} children (or grandchildren) ? 1 The problem is drawing attention, partly because of the rapid escalation of farmland values (many of the trust situations involve farmland or vacation property) and partly because income tax considerations are now viewed as more significant than federal estate tax problems with the $ 5 million applicable credit amount available, at least for 2011 and 2012. ...|$|R
40|$|In Hein v. W. T. Rawleigh Co. {{a husband}} and wife {{acquired}} real property <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> with the wife furnishing all the consideration. However, prior to this acquisition there had been a judgment entered against the husband in another action. The husband conveyed his rights to his wife who later died. Held: The wife’s devisee was entitled to have title to the property quieted subject to the judgment creditor’s lien on an undivided half. This decision presents the alternative questions: (1) whether a judgment lien on one joint tenant’s rights continues undisturbed after a severance caused by release of the debtor’s rights or (2) whether after severance the lien attaches to his severed interest and ceases as to the <b>joint</b> tenant’s rights. <b>In</b> conclusion, this case changes no existing rule of law. Liens may attach to a joint tenant’s rights and may become liens against the whole estate or be lost completely depending on who takes by the right of survivorship. If the property is severed during the lifetime of the tenants, the lien attaches to the judgment debtor’s share. ...|$|R
50|$|Morning gifts, {{which might}} also be {{arranged}} by the bride's father rather than the bride, are given to the bride herself; the name derives from the Germanic tribal custom of giving them {{the morning after the}} wedding night. She might have control of this morning gift during the lifetime of her husband, but is entitled to it when widowed. If the amount of her inheritance is settled by law rather than agreement, it may be called dower. Depending on legal systems and the exact arrangement, she may not be entitled to dispose of it after her death, and may lose the property if she remarries. Morning gifts were preserved for centuries in morganatic marriage, a union where the wife's inferior social status was held to prohibit her children from inheriting a noble's titles or estates. In this case, the morning gift would support the wife and children. Another legal provision for widowhood was jointure, in which property, often land, would be held <b>in</b> <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy,</b> so that it would automatically go to the widow on her husband's death.|$|R

Nothing passes to the heirs of the deceased tenant. In some jurisdictions, the specific words [...] "with right of survivorship" [...] must be used, or the tenancy will assumed to be tenants in common without rights of survivorship. The co-owners always take a JTWROS deed in equal shares, so each tenant must own an equal share of the property regardless of his/her contribution to purchase price. If the property is someday sold or subdivided, the proceeds must be distributed equally with no credits given for any excess than any one co-owner may have contributed to purchase the property.|$|R

40|$|Our talk today {{considers}} the issues facing a {{trustee in bankruptcy}} when attempting to ascertain the extent or existence of a bankrupt's <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> real property. We will highlight issues which a trustee might reasonably encounter in ascertaining the extent of property available for distribution to creditors. We will consider two elements in particular {{in light of the}} recent decision of the High Court in Cummins (a bankrupt) v Cummins, and the Federal Court in Anderson v Peldan. Both cases involved an examination of <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy.</b> <b>Joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> is one way for two or more co-owners to hold their estate in common. It will only arise where there is a unity of time, title, possession and interest between co-owners, and then only where there is an intention to hold as such (Property Law Act Qld provides for a presumption in favour of <b>tenancy</b> <b>in</b> common). The <b>joint</b> <b>tenancy</b> provides each co-owner the right to survivorship - upon the death of an owner that owner's estate is extinguished and the estate of surviving co-owners are enlarged proportionately to the extent of the deceased's estate. This occurs irrespective of the deceased’s testamentary wishes.
