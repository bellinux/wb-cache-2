40|$|Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) {{has gained}} much {{recognition}} {{over the last}} decades and has established itself among the well known public-key cryptography schemes, not least due its smaller key size and relatively lower computational effort compared to RSA. The wide employment of Elliptic Curve Cryptography in many different application areas has been leading {{to a variety of}} implementation types and domains ranging from pure software approaches over hardware <b>implemenations</b> to hardware/software co-designs. The following review provides an overview of state of the art hardware <b>implemenations</b> of ECC, specifically in regard to their targeted design goals. In this context the suitability of the hardware/software approach in regard to the security challenges opposed by the low-end embedded devices of the Internet of Things is briefly examined.

40|$|Concurrency control {{problems}} in centralized Database Management Systems have been actively studied in past two decades. Various types of concurrency control mechanisms {{have been proposed}} and implemented in practice. Among these mechanisms, Two-Phase Locking, Timestamping and Optimistic mechanisms have attracted most attention. This thesis presents a survey on these three mechanisms, identifies their major problems and ways to resolve these problems. Despite their popularity, literatures published to date on these three mechanisms are mostly theoretical in nature, discussions on their implementation issues are normally neglected. This thesis attempts to look into this aspect by investigating the use of concurrent programming techniques based on semaphore and monitor in their implementations. Detailed descriptions of the <b>implemenations</b> are given and various modifications to the concurrent programming techniques to improve their applicability in the DBMS environment are provided too...|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} {{parallel}} programming models that are simple {{to use and}} at the same time efficient for current ant future parallel platforms has led to recent attention to task-based models such as Cilk++, Intel TBB and the task concept in OpenMP version 3. 0. The choice of model and implementation can have a major impact on the final performance and in order to understand some of the trade-offs we have made a quantitative study comparing four implementations of OpenMP (gcc, Intel icc, Sun studio and the research compiler Mercurium/nanos mcc), Cilk++ and Wool, a high-performance task-based library developed at SICS. Abstract. We use microbenchmarks to characterize costs for task-creation and stealing and the Barcelona OpenMP Tasks Suite for characterizing application performance. By far Wool and Cilk++ have the lowest overhead in both spawning and stealing tasks. This is reflected in application performance when many tasks with small granularity are spawned where Cilk++ and, in particular, has the highest performance. For coarse granularity applications, the OpenMP implementations have quite similar performance as the more light-weight Cilk++ and Wool except for one application where mcc is superior thanks to a superior task scheduler. Abstract. The OpenMP <b>implemenations</b> are generally not yet ready for use when the task granularity becomes very small. There is no inherent reason for this, so we expect future implementations of OpenMP to focus on this issue. IMCOR...|$|R

This paper {{focuses on}} a class of problem {{relating}} to the multiplication of a single number by several coefficients that, while not constant, are drawn from a finite set of constants that change with time.

In addition, an efficient <b>implemenation</b> is presented targeting the Xilinx Virtex / Virtex-II family of FPGAs. We also introduce a novel use of Integer Linear Programming for finding solutions to the minimum-cost of such a multiplication problem. Our formulation results in area savings even for modest problem sizes. ...|$|E

In previous work, we have presented a method and tool {{support for the}} testing of concurrent Java components.

Testing thread interrupts is important because every Java component that calls wait must have code dealing with these interrupts. For a component that uses interrupts and timed waits to provide its basic functionality, the ability to test these features is clearly even more important.

40|$|To my {{wonderful}} wife Eldda tel- 00768862, version 1 - 26 Dec 2012 Digital Signal Processing algorithms {{are implemented}} in VLSI systems using fixedpoint arithmetic {{in order to}} obtain cost-effective hardware with optimized throughput and power consumption. However, the finite wordlength of the fixed-point representation introduces a quantization error that generates a degradation of the computational precision. The fixed-point implementation has to guarantee the performance constraints required by the application while minimizing the cost. The manual conversion of the floating-point algortihm using fixed-point data is error prone and time consuming and continues {{to be one of the}} most important steps of the design. An automatic source code tranformation from the floating-point representation to a fixed-point <b>implemenation</b> can significantly reduce the developement time.

However, we show that we can use the facilties available in Isabelle to provide all the structuring facilities (modules, abstraction, etc.) that are needed without compromising the simplicity of the original theory in any way, resulting in a thouroghly practical implementation. We further argue that {{it would be difficult to}} build a custom <b>implemenation</b> as effective.

40|$|An <b>implemenation</b> of Linear Predictive Coding, a low-bandwidth speech {{encoding}} scheme, {{built around}} the ADSP- 2105 signal processing CPU is described. The hardware schematics and software source code listing are included. 1 Motivation Often time {{it is necessary to}} carry voice communiations over a digital channel. For ordinary "toll-quality" communications voice is usually sent by sampling the signal at 8 Khz into 8 bit words. This results in a bit rate of 64, 000 bits per second. Waveform encoding techniques such as ADPCM can reduce this bit rate typically to 32000 or 24000 bits per second without much noticeable loss of quality. In some situations it is desireable to send speech over a much smaller digital channel. Speech coders take advantage of the characteristics of speech to encode speech in a much smaller bandwidth. Because speech coders are designed specifically for speech communications they do not handle non-speech data such as music well. Code Excited Linear Prediction or CELP c [...] ...|$|E
