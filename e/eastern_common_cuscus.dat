50|$|The <b>eastern</b> <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Phalanger intercastellanus) is {{a species}} of {{marsupial}} in the family Phalangeridae found in eastern Papua New Guinea. Until recently, it was considered conspecific with P. mimicus, and before that also with P. orientalis.|$|E
50|$|In a {{phylogenetic tree}} {{published}} in 1987 by Tim Flannery and his colleagues, Phalanger lullulae {{was believed to}} share the same states with Phalanger intercastellanus {{also known as the}} <b>Eastern</b> <b>common</b> <b>cuscus.</b> A morphological consensus tree shows that the Phalanger lullulae is related to the Mountain cuscus (Phalanger carmelatie), Phalanger interpositus, Stein's cuscus (Phalanger vestitus), and the Banggai cuscus (Strigocuscus pelengensis). This phylogenetic tree was created by Tim Flannery and his colleagues in 1987 but was also reanalyzed by Ruedas and Morales in 2005. A partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Ruedas and Morales demonstrated the firstly mentioned relationship between the Phalanger lullulae and Phalanger intercastellanus. The Partial 12S rRNA ML tree by Hamilton and Springer demonstrated that the Phalanger lullulae is most closely related to the Northern common cuscus (Phalanger orientalis). An ML tree of the nuclear gene BRCA1 created by Raterman and his colleagues shows the Phalanger lullulae's close relationship to the Phalanger orientalis as well. While these aforementioned phylogenies are more certain, there is another proposed morphological phylogeny by Flannery that demonstrates the uncertainty of the Phalanger lullulae's relationship among the Phalanger orientalis and Phalanger vestitus.|$|E

50|$|The Northern <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> inhabits {{the islands}} of Timor, {{specifically}} Indonesia and Timor Leste, Wetar and Leti (both to Indonesia) through the Kai Islands {{and a number of}} the Moluccan Islands of Indonesia (including: Ambon, Buru, and Seram); it is also found on {{the islands of}} Misool, Waigeo, Batanta, and Salawati (all Indonesia), and ranges over much of {{the northern part of the}} island of New Guinea (Indonesia and Papua New Guinea), including a number of offshore islands. It ranges as far east as the Bismarck Archipelago, Papua New Guinea, where it is present on many islands including the islands of New Britain and New Ireland. It also occurs on many of the Solomon Islands. It is believed that many of the insular island populations are the result of prehistorical introductions, possibly including: Timor, Seram, Buru, Sanana, the Kai Islands, the Bismarck Archipelago, and the Solomon Island chain. Local villagers in the above-mentioned countries and regions reported that the northern <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> can be found in any substantially forested areas from coastal monsoon rainforest and gallery forest to remnant montane rainforest.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> is {{typically}} very shy, {{so it is}} rarely seen, especially in northern Australia. It is nocturnal, hunting and feeding at night and sleeping during the day on self-made platforms in tree branches. It also has been found resting in tree hollows, under tree roots, or among rocks. It is slow-moving and somewhat sluggish, sometimes mistaken for sloths, other possums, or even monkeys. Unlike its close relatives, the <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> has been observed feeding during the day on rare occasions.|$|R

50|$|The <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> is {{hunted for}} its meat and pelt in New Guinea, but {{has very little}} {{economical}} influence. Despite hunting, it is still common in New Guinea and most islands, but it is rarely spotted in Australia, mostly {{because it is a}} very shy creature. It was introduced by humans to Salyer, Mussau, and New Ireland, and has since flourished in these areas. The conservation status of the <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> is least concern because of its wide population distribution, ability to flourish in a variety of environments, and lack of dominating predators. However, continued human expansion, an increase in demand for cuscus meat and pelts, and destruction of its natural habitat could lead to a demise in the spotted cuscus predominance.|$|R

The cuscus is a pouched marsupial grouped in the Phalangeridae family, which is nocturnal, arboreal, herbivore, {{and in most cases}} the tail is prehensile. The animals are legally protected due to low reproduction, limited distribution area, and high rate of illegal hunting. The illegal hunting happened not only in the production forest areas but also in the reserve areas such as Nature Reserve of Arfak Mountain, directly or indirectly, affects the life quality of the ecosystem, mainly cuscuses population. Therefore, it is necessary to do efforts to have a better management of the region to ensure the sustenance of many components in it. This research is aimed to know the population density of cuscus in Arfak Mountain Nature Reserve and carried out for two months. The method used was descriptive by using direct and indirect observation. The result shows that cuscuses existing in the Arfak Mountain conservation area were northern <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Phalanger orientalis), ground cuscus (Phalanger gymnotis) and <b>common</b> spotted <b>cuscus</b> (Spilocuscus maculatus).

Two species of cuscus occurs in the study site were <b>common</b> <b>cuscus</b> (Phalanger orientalis) and spotted cuscus (Spilocuscus maculatus) and they were observed as hunting target in CABU. Hunting was performed partly as routine activity used various traditional tools (slash blade, trap, spear, and calling cuscus) and modern weapon (firearm). Cuscus hunting was done to supply animal protein for households, inspite some hunting results raised for consumption and market purposes. For one period of hunting 3 - 4 cuscus were caught and it was lower than five years ago. It was indicated that the population condition was vulnerable on overharvest and at the present time cuscus population tend to decreased. Traditional wisdom of Biak ethnic group should be explored and practiced again as the form of local law in order to manage cuscus hunting for the future cuscus conservation program...|$|R

Interactions with others, especially between competing males, can be aggressive and confrontational. Male cuscuses scent mark their territory to warn off other males, emitting a penetrating musk odor both from {{their bodies and}} scent gland excretions. They distribute saliva on branches and twigs of trees to inform others of their territory and mediate social interactions. If they encounter another male in their area, they make barking, snarling, and hissing noises, and stand upright to defend their territories. They are aggressive, and can scratch, bite, and kick potential predators.|$|R

40|$|The {{divergence}} of bonobos {{and three}} subspecies {{of the common}} chimpanzee was examined under a multipopulation isolation-with-migration (IM) model with data from 73 loci drawn from the literature. A benefit of having a full multipopulation model, relative to conducting multiple pairwise analyses between sampled populations, is that a full model can reveal historical gene flow involving ancestral populations. An example of this was found in which gene flow is indicated between the western common chimpanzee subspecies and the ancestor of the central and the <b>eastern</b> <b>common</b> chimpanzee subspecies. The results of a full analysis on all four populations are strongly consistent with analyses on pairs of populations and generally similar to results from previous studies. The basal split between bonobos and common chimpanzees was estimated at 0. 93 Ma (0. 68 – 1. 54 Ma, 95 % highest posterior density interval), with the split among the ancestor of three common chimpanzee populations at 0. 46 Ma (0. 35 – 0. 65), {{and the most recent}} split between central and <b>eastern</b> <b>common</b> chimpanzee populations at 0. 093 Ma (0. 041 – 0. 157).
