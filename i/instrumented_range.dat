To train armored combat units during battle exercises, SRI developed the Deployable Force-on-Force <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Range</b> System (DFIRST), which uses GPS satellites, high-speed wireless communications, and digital terrain map displays.|$|E
2500|$|Wallops Flight Facility (WFF) , {{located on}} the Eastern Shore of Virginia, United States, {{approximately}} [...] north-northeast of Norfolk, is operated by the Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland, primarily as a rocket launch site to support science and exploration missions for NASA and other Federal agencies. WFF includes an extensively <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> to support launches {{of more than a}} dozen types of sounding rockets, small expendable suborbital and orbital rockets, high-altitude balloon flights carrying scientific instruments for atmospheric and astronomical research and—using its Research Airport—flight tests of aeronautical research aircraft including unmanned aerial vehicles.|$|E
50|$|The radar {{will report}} {{incorrect}} distance for reflections from distances beyond the <b>instrumented</b> <b>range,</b> such {{as from the}} moon. FMCW range measurements are only reliable to about 60% of the <b>instrumented</b> <b>range,</b> or about 300 km for 100 Hz FM.|$|E

50|$|Pricing {{depends on}} {{application}} {{and type of}} product. <b>Instruments</b> <b>range</b> from as low as $10 to thousands of dollars.|$|R
50|$|The second {{difficulty}} {{is that there are}} millions of objects in low-earth orbit. Reflections from distances beyond the <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> can degrade performance.|$|E
50|$|The <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> is {{the maximum}} {{distance}} where full performance is required. This means that an object {{no larger than}} the cross section area must be detectable at all altitudes and velocities.|$|E
50|$|Range {{demodulation}} {{is limited}} to 1/4 wavelength of the transmit modulation. <b>Instrumented</b> <b>range</b> for 100 Hz FM would be 500 km. That limit depends upon the type of modulation and demodulation. The following generally applies.|$|E

50|$|The <b>instrument</b> <b>range</b> is {{typically}} from one ohm to one billion ohms. This is adequate {{for the entire}} resistivity range in single-crystal silicon.|$|R
50|$|Air/surface search: One Fregat M2EM (NATO: Top Plate) 3D {{circular}} scan radar at E-band frequency, provides target indication to the Shtil-1 missile system. Featuring continuous electronically scanned arrays, {{the radar}} rotates at 12 or 6 rpm {{and has an}} <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> to 300 km.|$|E
5000|$|For example, an L band {{radar system}} using a PRF of 10 kHz with a duty cycle of 3.3% can {{identify}} true range to {{a distance of}} 450 km (30 * C / 10,000 km/s). This is the <b>instrumented</b> <b>range.</b> Unambiguous velocity is 1,500 m/s (3,300 mile/hour).|$|E
5000|$|KALKAN-II is {{a mobile}} X band phased array 3D search and track radar for point and area defense of {{critical}} {{military and civilian}} assets. KALKAN-II offers an <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> of 120 km and can track multiple targets accurately, adding classification and identification information to each target track.|$|E

5000|$|Pulse-Doppler can {{reliably}} resolve true range at all distances {{less than}} the <b>Instrumented</b> <b>Range.</b> The optimum pair of PRF used for a pulse-Doppler detection scheme must be different by a minimum of [...] This makes the range of each PRF different by {{the width of the}} sample period.|$|E
50|$|Ducting {{influence}} becomes stronger as frequency drops. Below 3 MHz, {{the whole}} {{volume of the}} air acts as a waveguide {{to fill in the}} radar shadow and also reduces radar sensitivity above the duct zone. Ducting fills in the shadow zone, extends the distance of the clutter zone, and can create reflections for low PRF radar that are beyond the <b>instrumented</b> <b>range.</b>|$|E

50|$|The main sensor is Saab's (formerly Ericsson Microwave System) HARD AESA 3D air {{search radar}} with an <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> of 20 km or an Infra-red search and track, {{depending}} upon the customer's specifications. The effector is {{the latest version of}} the Saab Bofors Dynamics RBS 70 surface-to-air missile, called Bolide. The missile is a laser guidance beam riding short range missile equipped with a highly effective proximity fuze. It is supposed to be effective against cruise missiles.|$|E
50|$|Coastal Surveillance Systems (CSS) - A {{network of}} 13 radar coastal {{surveillance}} systems is being installed from Pulau Banggi to Tawau, with 8 already in operation. This network is controlled from the Armed Forces' joint base in Tawau. Five state-of-the-art Airbus SPEXER 2000 Coastal radars, with an <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> of approximately 250km, will {{be installed in}} 2016. These sophisticated radars are able to track very small and slowly moving objects such as swimmers and also fast objects such as speed boats.|$|E
50|$|The Range {{was first}} {{established}} {{in support of}} the Anglo-Australian Joint Project. This cold-war project focussed on the development of long-range weapons systems, principally to counter the growing intercontinental ballistic missile threat from the former Soviet Union. The cold-war heyday of the Range was 1947 to about 1972. In 1980 the Anglo-Australia Project was closed and the range itself saw little use until about 1991 when the RAAF's Aircraft Research and Development Unit (ARDU) took over the old <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> from Defence Science and Technology Organisation (DSTO). Since that time, the RAAF has gradually assumed full control of the entire facility.|$|E

25|$|Several {{makers have}} {{produced}} ocarinas with keys, mostly experimentally, {{beginning in the}} late 19th century.

50|$|This {{features}} a 13 m antenna mast and is normally {{carried on a}} 6x6 5-ton cross-country truck which carries the radar and command and control shelter. <b>Instrumented</b> <b>range</b> is 75 km and altitude coverage extends from ground-level to 10,000 m. An optional add-on unit extends the radars coastal defense capabilities. In Swedish service the radar is designated PS-90. In the Greek Air Force Giraffe 75 is used in combination with Contraves (now Rheinmetall defense) Skyguard/Sparrow fire control systems. 1 Giraffe typically controls 2 Skyguard systems each with 2 twin 35 mm GDF-005 guns and 2 Sparrow surface-to-air missile launchers.|$|E
5000|$|One of the {{critical}} findings of the Ault Report was {{that many of the}} missile failures were due to out of envelope firings due to unfamiliarity of the aircrews with the dynamically changing launch acceptability regions (LAR). Ault proposed to create an <b>instrumented</b> <b>range</b> to help aircrews become familiar with the complexities of firing their air-to-air missiles. This led to development of the Air Combat Maneuvering Range (ACMR) at MCAS Yuma for use by aircraft flying out of NAS Miramar. The Air Force was faced with the same problem and also began development of a similar Air Combat Maneuvering Instrumentation (ACMI) range at Nellis AFB ...|$|E
