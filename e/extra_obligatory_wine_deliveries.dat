50|$|Currently {{the line}} is used several times an hour for freight. The trains run between Ehrang and Wasserbillig and between Saarbrücken and Apach. The railway to the Euren/Zewen {{industrial}} area is served from Monday to Friday at noon by a freight exchange train (Übergabegüterzug), which runs regularly from Ehrang via Trier-West and Euren. Additional services, such as <b>wine</b> <b>deliveries</b> to Schloss Wachenheim, operate as required. In addition, the Trier West Railway serves as an alternative route for freight, depending on the workload through Trier Hauptbahnhof.|$|R

50|$|As a glassmaker, Riedel was {{interested}} primarily in function over appearance, and {{broke away from}} the traditional richly cut, heavy and thick glass designs of the time. He spent 16 years studying the physics of <b>wine</b> <b>delivery</b> to the mouth and taste buds and experimenting with different glass configurations, matching them with wines of different regions, grape origin and age to create stemware that would match and complement specific wines and spirits. He was among the first glassware experts in history to recognize that the taste of wine is affected by the shape of the glass from which it is consumed.|$|R

This paper presents, in a detailed way, some of the main features of the PerLa language by show-ing how it {{can be applied to the}} wine production process. The wine production process requires the cooperation of many different ”technolo-gies ” and expertises, which work in a pipelined manner: from the ”wine design”, performed by the oenologist, of the blending and timing for a quality wine, to the grape cultivation in the vineyard, up to the <b>wine</b> <b>delivery</b> to the consumer table, a...|$|R
5000|$|The Nichelini Winery [...] "officially" [...] closed {{during the}} years of Prohibition. However, the winery was {{well-known}} in the area as a source for bootleg wine, even supplying the governor's household. [...] In 1920, a man named Clifford Clark {{wrote a letter to the}} sheriff complaining about rowdy drunken behavior in the nearby town of Monticello, citing locals having [...] "good times, drinking wine", and that there was [...] "no question, but what the wine comes from Nichelini's". [...] After a warning fine was issued in 1923, Anton was finally arrested on January 8, 1924, and taken to the St. Helena jail. [...] Despite the arrest, the Nichelini family continued to surreptitiously supply wine to local miners and Bay Area residents, sometimes through the cover of a sacramental <b>wine</b> <b>delivery</b> service.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{rules were}} broken: first, Heather touched {{one of the}} bikes before {{starting}} the <b>Wine</b> <b>Delivery</b> challenge, even after being expressly told {{they were unable to}} do so before they decided on which bike each team would ride. Second, both Bill and Darwin partook in some ice cream at a local cafe after the pizza dinner, even though the pizzas were supposed to be the only food available to them that night. The team was fined a total of $10,000 for these infractions, and were warned that further breaches of the rules would incur a $20,000 penalty.

50|$|Meanwhile, Itzik {{lives in}} Marseilles with Juliette, working in her father's winery and {{desperately trying to}} win his approval. After a series of failures, Itzik befriends Kika, an Israeli coffee shop owner in Amsterdam, who hooks him up {{with a series of}} illegal drug {{smuggling}} jobs for an eccentric French-Israeli entrepreneur named Ouliel. Itzik tries to disguise the money he makes as successful <b>wine</b> <b>deliveries,</b> but Juliette's father calls his bluff rather quickly, and Juliette herself discovers the nature of Itzik's endeavors; enraged, she orders him to leave her house and never return. Itzik does so and goes to stay in a hotel; unbeknownst to him, the three friends are in the same hotel, after accidentally getting to Kika's coffee shop, receiving the winery's address from her and subsequently getting no help from Juliette's father. The four reunite in a joyfully tearful manner, but get involuntarily tangled in what {{turns out to be a}} failed hit by Mossad agents (including Itai) on a radical Islamic terrorist link when Motti saves Itai from a gunshot. Panicking, they flee the hotel, with Itai critically wounded, and inadvertently become fugitives after the French police discovers the CCTV footage, believing the four to be accomplices.|$|R
5000|$|Hungarian wine regions offer a {{great variety}} of styles: the main {{products}} of the country are elegant and full-bodied dry whites with good acidity, although complex sweet whites (Tokaj), elegant (Eger) and full-bodied robust reds (Villány and Szekszárd). The main varieties are: Olaszrizling, Hárslevelű, Furmint, Pinot gris or Szürkebarát, Chardonnay (whites), Kékfrankos (or Blaufrankisch in German), Kadarka, Portugieser, Zweigelt, Cabernet sauvignon, Cabernet franc and Merlot. The most famous wines from Hungary are Tokaji Aszú and Egri Bikavér. Tokaji, meaning [...] "of Tokaj", or [...] "from Tokaj" [...] in Hungarian, is used to label wines from the wine region of Tokaj-Hegyalja. Tokaji wine has received accolades from numerous great writers and composers including Beethoven, Liszt, Schubert and Goethe; Joseph Haydn's favorite wine was a Tokaji. Louis XV and Frederick the Great tried to outdo one another when they entertained guests with Tokaji. Napoleon III, the last Emperor of France, ordered 30-40 barrels of Tokaji at the French Royal Court every year. Gustav III, King of Sweden, loved Tokaji. In Russia, customers included Peter the Great and Empress Elizabeth, while Catherine the Great actually established a Russian garrison in the town of Tokaj with the aim of assuring regular <b>wine</b> <b>deliveries</b> to St. Petersburg.|$|R
50|$|Pizza Chefs: Initially, it {{appeared}} Bill {{would have little}} problem sabotaging the game, because after an hour, the team had little to show for their efforts. However, they unexpectedly met up with a boy who helped them complete the task with ease. Since {{he was not able}} to foil the game itself, after dinner, Bill noticed a nearby trattoria selling ice cream and bought some (eating it very quickly), complaining he was still hungry after the less-than-satisfying homemade pizza (as the players neglected to wash their hand when making the pizzas). Darwin, spotting Bill with the frozen treat, was interested too. Bill gave him some money, and he bought some ice cream of his own. This was a violation of the rules regarding the pizza challenge, since players were expressly informed that the pizza they ate for dinner was to be the only food available to them that evening. While Bill scarfed down his ice cream almost unnoticed to everyone, Darwin saved his and ate it in front of the other players. The other players saw him with food, but ultimately dismissed it as an honest mistake. Later that evening, the players were informed that a $10,000 penalty would be assessed to the pot due to the food violations. Players were suspicious, but put more emphasis on Heather's mistake in the <b>Wine</b> <b>Delivery</b> game that same day. Bill succeeded in sabotaging a game with minimal suspicion.|$|R
40|$|Many, if not all, {{manufacturing}} processes in industry require scheduling activities; such activities {{are very important}} as often they determine {{the success or failure}} of some companies. For example, in wine production, grapes are planted, mature fruits are harvested, transported and crushed then the juice obtained is placed in tanks, which are managed during fermentation, and finally the wine is bottle. A schedule can be a solution to a problem which has several, possibly conflicting objectives, e. g. the mininisation of production costs and delays while meeting customer-imposed <b>wine</b> <b>delivery</b> times; the problem also has constraints, e. g. a bottling line cannot be used without being cleaned to process white wine when it last processed red wine. As can be expected, the problem has variables such as the number of wine bottles ordered. The environment (e. g. wine factory) in which the schedule is implemented may change (e. g. one bottling line breaks down) whereby this schedule becomes infeasible. Consequently, there could be a need to solve a new scheduling problem to obtain a new schedule best suited to the new state of the environment. The number of variables in this new problem may be the same as that of the previous problem. A large proportion of research effort has been directed towards scheduling problems with a constant number of variables despite changes in the environments where the problems are set. However, there are important scheduling problems where the number of variables could vary. For example, in some models of job-shop scheduling problems there are occurrences of additional rush jobs and job cancellations. This thesis deals with one particular class of scheduling problems, each being multi-objective, resource constrained, and having numbers and values of variables which vary over time. Various traditional operation research methods as well as a few Artificial Intelligence-based techniques, such as Multi-Agent Systems and Evolutionary Algorithms (EA), have been applied to solve this type of problem. In this thesis, a memory-based EA technique was applied to solve problems from the class. Being memory-based, this technique utilises the solutions to problems set in previous states of an environment in order to solve a problem set in the current state of this environment. The memory-based EA technique, referred to as Centroid-Based Adaptation with Random Immigrants (CBAR), is applicable only to solve multi-objective, resource-constrained problems with a constant number of variables. In this thesis, CBAR is extended to become applicable to solve all problems from the above-mentioned class. The result of this extension is a technique referred to as Mapping of Task IDs for CBAR (McBAR). This thesis investigates the performance, the performance stability over environmental dynamics, and the efficiency of McBAR for solving various problems from the above class, legitimises the sub-algorithms that constitute McBAR and extends McBAR to become proactive (anticipative of future environmental changes). Compared to the other techniques investigated in this thesis, results showed McBAR to have the best and most stable performance, and to be most efficient for determining solutions to problems from the above class. All of the sub-algorithms of McBAR are shown to be legitimate, while McBAR having been made proactive is shown to be beneficial in some applications. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|The {{identification}} and working mechanisms of Rebound Effects (REs) have important policy implications. The intensity of these impacts is crucial {{when it comes}} to detecting strategies to promote sustainable consumption of food and beverages, {{as in the case of}} wine. In fact, neglecting the occurrence of REs in <b>wine</b> production and <b>delivery</b> leads to under- or over-estimating the effects that novel more sustainable technologies may produce. An in-depth analysis on the ways in which the stakeholders may react to the availability of a new product (e. g. wine produced through a process oriented to the reduction of CO 2 emissions) may be particularly useful to allow producers and consumers to target the REs with respect to the overall goals of desired sustainability. In this article, we first provide a definition and a classification of different types of REs and then analyse some exemplificative cases applied to the supply and consumption of wine produced through technologies that reduce environmental emissions or resource consumptions. A final step analyses the methodological tools that may be useful when including REs in life cycle thinking as applied to the wine sector...|$|R
