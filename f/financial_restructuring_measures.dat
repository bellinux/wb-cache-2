Using a questionnaire survey we investigated the opinions of Slovak companies’ managers on the selected tax provisions related to cross-border transactions.

The intended changes of tax provisions that facilitate international tax planning will have adverse impact on motivation to perform cross-border <b>financial</b> <b>restructuring</b> operations by Slovak companies...|$|R
