On July 10, 1974, the anniversary of her 99th birthday, the Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial, by artist Robert Berks, was erected in her honor in Lincoln Park (Washington, D.C.) It was the first monument honoring an African American or a woman to be installed in a public park in the District of Columbia. At least 18,000 people attended the unveiling ceremony (although one estimate claims that approximately 250,000 people attended) including Shirley Chisholm, the first African-American woman elected to Congress. The funds for the monument were raised by the National Council of Negro Women. [...] The inscription on the pedestal reads [...] "let her works praise her," [...] while the side is engraved with a passage from her [...] "Last Will and Testament":I leave you love. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> hope. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> the challenge of developing confidence in one another. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> a thirst for education. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> a respect for the use of power. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> faith. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> racial dignity. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> a desire to live harmoniously with your fellow men. <b>I</b> <b>leave</b> <b>you</b> a responsibility to our young people.In 1985 the US Postal Service issued a stamp in Bethune's honor.

[...] In 1999, Ebony Magazine included her as one of the [...] "100 Most Fascinating Black Women of the 20th century."

500|$|In 1963, Sinatra {{reunited with}} Nelson Riddle for The Concert Sinatra, an ambitious album {{featuring}} a 73-piece symphony orchestra arranged and conducted by Riddle. The concert was recorded on a motion picture scoring soundstage {{with the use}} of multiple synchronized recording machines that employed an optical signal onto 35mm film designed for movie soundtracks. Granata considers the album to have been [...] "impeachable" [...] , [...] "one of the very best of the Sinatra-Riddle ballad albums", in which Sinatra displayed an impressive vocal range, particularly in [...] "Ol' Man River", in which he darkened the hue. [...] In 1964 the song [...] "My Kind of Town" [...] was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Sinatra released Softly, as <b>I</b> <b>Leave</b> <b>You,</b> and collaborated with Bing Crosby and Fred Waring on America, I Hear You Singing, a collection of patriotic songs recorded as a tribute to the assassinated President John F. Kennedy. Sinatra increasingly became involved in charitable pursuits in this period. In 1961 and 1962 he went to Mexico, with the sole purpose of putting on performances for Mexican charities, and in July 1964 he was present for the dedication of the Frank Sinatra International Youth Center for Arab and Jewish children in Nazareth.|$|E
