5|$|In {{the next}} contest, Ric <b>Flair</b> and Razor Ramon {{wrestled}} against Mr. Perfect and Randy Savage. Ramon and Perfect began the match, but <b>Flair</b> entered after Perfect insulted him. Perfect threw <b>Flair</b> into the corner, and Flair's momentum carried {{him over the}} top rope to the ring apron. Savage attacked <b>Flair</b> and then took Perfect's place in the ring to maintain the advantage over <b>Flair.</b> From outside the ring, Ramon hit Savage with his knee and <b>Flair</b> and Ramon took turns attacking Savage's knee. While Ramon performed a half Boston crab on Savage, Perfect considered leaving the match and abandoning Savage. Savage recovered briefly by trying to pin <b>Flair,</b> but Ramon performed a chokeslam on Savage. Ric <b>Flair</b> attempted to attack Savage from the top rope, but Savage threw him to the ring floor instead. Perfect executed a neckbreaker and an atomic drop on Ramon. Outside of the ring, <b>Flair</b> attacked Savage with a chair. The referee was knocked unconscious, and Perfect tried to pin Ramon by performing a PerfectPlex. Because no referee was available to count the pinfall, a substitute referee came to the ring. The first referee recovered as Perfect attempted to pin <b>Flair</b> with a PerfectPlex. <b>Flair</b> escaped the pin attempt, and he and Ramon attacked Perfect until the referees were unable to keep the match under control. As a result, Ramon and <b>Flair</b> were disqualified, and the victory was awarded to Perfect and Savage.|$|E
5|$|In {{the next}} match, Mick Foley faced Ric <b>Flair</b> in a 2-Out-of-3 Falls Match. Foley gained the {{advantage}} after he executed a Double Underhook DDT. Foley {{then began to}} taunt <b>Flair</b> and took out Mr. Socko, a dirty sock puppet, dressed like <b>Flair.</b> Foley controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the Figure-Four Leglock, but <b>Flair</b> countered with an inside cradle over Foley to win the first fall. Frustrated, Foley grabbed a trash can from under the ring {{and brought it to}} the ring to hit <b>Flair</b> with it. But, <b>Flair</b> avoided the attacked, as he tripped Foley to apply the Figure-Four Leglock. At the end, Foley got disqualified when he hit <b>Flair</b> with the trash can. The referee awarded <b>Flair</b> the win. After the match, Foley attacked <b>Flair</b> with a barb-wired bat, leaving <b>Flair</b> busted open.|$|E
5|$|Randy Orton began a {{feud with}} Ric <b>Flair,</b> after <b>Flair</b> {{was the one}} {{responsible}} for making Orton lose the match against Batista. Orton commented on every accomplishment that <b>Flair</b> had made and criticized him for calling Triple H the greatest wrestler of all. <b>Flair</b> retaliated to Orton's comments, stating that individuals like Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley, who Orton had previously feuded with, were not legends, therefore Orton was not a Legend Killer. <b>Flair</b> also stated that he and Orton would have a match at Taboo Tuesday and the fans would {{have the opportunity to}} choose what type of match they face in. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton and <b>Flair</b> met in a Steel Cage match, which was the fans selection. Orton won the match after delivering an RKO to <b>Flair.</b> After the match, <b>Flair</b> shook Orton's hand.|$|E
2500|$|The film's {{original}} {{music was}} written by French electropop musician Lionel <b>Flairs,</b> who performs under the moniker <b>Flairs.</b> It was his first composition for film. When he was approached by Sattouf to compose the soundtrack, <b>Flairs</b> was reluctant because he preferred total freedom when writing music, but after he agreed he enjoyed collaborating with Sattouf. The soundtrack is less like Flairs's usual [...] "happy pop" [...] because Sattouf wanted a sad feel to reflect the sadness in the characters' lives.|$|R

5|$|The first {{match of}} the event was the tag team {{encounter}} of Chris Benoit and William Regal against the team of Evolution (Ric <b>Flair</b> and Batista). The match started off with Batista and Chris Benoit, who brawled back and forth until <b>Flair</b> was tagged in. <b>Flair</b> and Benoit exchanged knife edge chops. Batista and Regal then spar, but Batista was able to gain control over Regal, until Benoit and <b>Flair</b> tag in to the match. Benoit and <b>Flair</b> spar back and forth, until <b>Flair</b> applied the Figure four lock only for Benoit to reverse it into the Crippler Crossface, in which <b>Flair</b> submitted to, giving the win to Benoit and Regal.|$|E
5|$|After Bad Blood, Steve Austin {{announced}} an Elimination Chamber match {{to take place}} at SummerSlam for the World Heavyweight Championship, a match contested in a ring surrounded by a steel structure of chain and girders. The match featured, Chris Jericho, Goldberg, Kevin Nash, Randy Orton, and Shawn Michaels; at SummerSlam, Triple H won the match to retain the World Heavyweight title. The storyline between <b>Flair</b> and Michaels ended when Michaels was announced as {{a participant in the}} Elimination Chamber match, in which <b>Flair</b> would not participate. Although their feud ended, the feud reengaged five years later in 2008. At WrestleMania XXIV, Michaels defeated <b>Flair</b> in a retirement match, a stipulation that only applied to <b>Flair.</b> As a result, <b>Flair</b> retired from professional wrestling.|$|E
5|$|After {{a four-month}} hiatus, Triple H {{returned}} on the WWE Homecoming episode of Raw on October 3.

The duo defeated Masters and Carlito; after the match, Triple H turned on <b>Flair</b> and hit him with a sledgehammer.

5|$|After plans by WWF {{writers to}} turn the Ultimate Warrior against Savage were {{scrapped}} due to the Warrior's refusal to turn heel, the two were scheduled to face <b>Flair</b> and Ramon at Survivor Series 1992. However, as the Warrior quit the promotion on November 21, his spot was surprisingly offered to Mr. Perfect, who accepted it in spite of <b>Flair,</b> thereby turning face and initiating a feud with <b>Flair</b> which culminated in <b>Flair</b> leaving the WWF in January 1993.|$|E
5|$|In {{the main}} event, Randy Orton faced Ric <b>Flair</b> in a steel cage match, which gained 68% of the vote. During the match, both Orton and <b>Flair</b> {{managed to get}} the upper hand.

5|$|In {{the next}} main match, Ric <b>Flair</b> faced Shawn Michaels. During the match, Michaels {{set up a}} table at ringside and {{positioned}} <b>Flair</b> on it. Randy Orton then came through the audience and attempted to interfere in the match, but Michaels performed Sweet Chin Music on him and put <b>Flair</b> through {{the table with a}} Splash. Near the end of the match, Michaels knocked the referee down and {{as he was about to}} perform a Sweet Chin Music on <b>Flair,</b> allowing Orton to hit Michaels with a chair. Orton then placed <b>Flair</b> on top of Michaels and ran out of the ring. When the referee recuperated, he saw the cover and officiated the pinfall made by <b>Flair.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} match, Ric <b>Flair</b> defended the WWE Intercontinental Championship against Triple H inside a Steel Cage, which gained 83% of the vote. During the match, Triple H sent <b>Flair</b> head-first into the steel cage, bloodying Flair's from the head. In one point, Triple H {{retrieved}} a steel chain, {{wrapped it around}} his fist and attempted a diving fist drop from the top turnbuckle. However, <b>Flair</b> countered, raising his foot to Triple H's face and performed a series of knife edged chops. Triple H controlled most of the match, until he attempted to apply the figure four leglock, a signature move of Flair's, resulting in <b>Flair</b> sending him towards the steel cage. After that, <b>Flair</b> bit Triple H's head, bloodying him from his forehead, this often results when a wrestler is trapped, either {{in a corner of}} the ring or in a submission hold, as a desperation move. The match ended when <b>Flair</b> reversed a Pedigree with a back body drop and hit Triple H with a steel chair thrice, allowing <b>Flair</b> to escape through the steel cage door to win the match and retain his Intercontinental title.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{featured}} preliminary matches was Shawn Michaels versus Ric <b>Flair</b> in a singles match. The hype to this match began on May 26, 2003 during {{an episode of}} Raw, where Michaels challenged <b>Flair</b> to a singles match for later during the show, which <b>Flair</b> accepted. As the match {{was about to take}} place, the other General Manager, Eric Bischoff, announced that the <b>Flair</b> versus Michaels match was to take place at Bad Blood instead of on the broadcast of Raw. Later on that episode, <b>Flair</b> and Michaels lost to World Champion Triple H in a Handicap match after <b>Flair</b> cheap shoted Michaels, enabling Triple H to finish him off with the Pedigree. The following Monday on an episode of Raw, Michaels and <b>Flair</b> were in a promotional in-ring segment, where they both discussed who was the better wrestler. Later during the program, Michaels, along with Kevin Nash and The Hurricane defeated Evolution. The feud between <b>Flair</b> and Michaels enhanced on the June 9, 2003 episode of Raw. During the show, <b>Flair</b> and Michaels managed Randy Orton and The Hurricane, respectively; after Orton defeated The Hurricane, <b>Flair</b> and Michaels were scripted to brawl until the program went into a commercial break.|$|E

A few recordings were made with the Cadets name in 1960; this was Davis and Collins with the <b>Flairs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Ric <b>Flair</b> and Mr. Perfect {{continued}} their feud, although <b>Flair</b> legitimately requested {{to be released}} from his WWF contract in order to return to World Championship Wrestling (WCW). His request was granted on the condition that he help build up Perfect as a credible babyface. The two men attacked each other during the battle royal at Royal Rumble 1993, and Perfect eliminated <b>Flair</b> from the match. The following night, Perfect defeated <b>Flair</b> in a loser leaves town match. <b>Flair</b> did not return to the WWF until McMahon purchased WCW in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Royal Rumble, <b>Flair</b> faced Perfect in a loser leaves town match, {{in which the}} loser {{would be forced to}} leave the WWF forever. Because <b>Flair</b> had an {{agreement}} with McMahon to lose to Mr. Perfect before leaving the promotion, Perfect won the match and <b>Flair</b> did not appear in the WWF again until 2001. With <b>Flair</b> gone from the promotion, Luger continued Heenan's feud and defeated Mr. Perfect at WrestleMania IX.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Kenny Dykstra and Ric <b>Flair</b> continued. As {{a reward}} for {{defeating}} <b>Flair</b> at New Year's Revolution, Coachman booked Dykstra in a match with Hardy for his WWE Intercontinental Championship. <b>Flair</b> interfered and performed a low blow to Dykstra, allowing Hardy to win. On the following Raw, <b>Flair</b> defeated Dykstra in a rematch, ending their rivalry. The feuds between Carlito and Chris Masters, and Mickie James and Victoria also ended after Carlito and James won subsequent rematches, {{and they began to}} feud with Ric <b>Flair</b> and Melina respectively. The match between Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell was actually a parody match, with talent from WWE's developmental territories portraying the characters. This was the early stage of a major feud between Donald Trump and Vince McMahon, which would go on to WrestleMania.|$|E

5|$|The feud between Ric <b>Flair</b> and Kenny Dykstra (originally just Kenny) {{stemmed from}} Flair's feud with the Spirit Squad, which Dykstra {{was a part}} of. On the October 23 edition of Raw, Dykstra was angered by his teammates' recent losing streak against <b>Flair,</b> and he proved himself by {{defeating}} <b>Flair</b> that night in a singles match. Two weeks after defeating the Spirit Squad for the World Tag Team Championship, <b>Flair</b> and Roddy Piper lost their title to Rated-RKO. The legitimate reason behind their title loss was that Piper {{was diagnosed with cancer}} and had to immediately leave the show. <b>Flair,</b> however, continued to feud with the Spirit Squad, defeating them all at Survivor Series with his team of WWE legends. On the November 27 edition of Raw, <b>Flair</b> teamed up with DX to take on the Spirit Squad in a 3-on-5 handicap match. <b>Flair</b> and DX won, and DX packed them all in a crate (excluding Dykstra) and kayfabe sent them to Ohio Valley Wrestling. It was announced that <b>Flair</b> would face Dykstra at New Year's Revolution.|$|E
5|$|The fifth {{match was}} between Montel Vontavious Porter (MVP) and Ric <b>Flair</b> for the WWE United States Championship. The match started with <b>Flair</b> {{executing}} {{a series of}} backhand chops to MVP. <b>Flair</b> kept the advantage and applied the figure four leglock. MVP countered, by executing a low blow. MVP then performed the Playmaker and pinned <b>Flair</b> to retain the United States Championship.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for SummerSlam {{was to bring}} Ric <b>Flair</b> over from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) to the WWF. Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} WWF, wanted <b>Flair</b> to challenge Savage in the main event for the WWF Championship. <b>Flair,</b> however, felt obliged to the NWA and did not leave the promotion for the WWF. Therefore, Hogan and Savage were paired together to end their feuds with their respective on-screen rivals. <b>Flair</b> would not join the WWF until 1991.|$|E

In 1961, with Matousek on lead vocals and rhythm guitar, Bob Dawdy on lead guitar, Jerry DeMers on electric bass and Don Bourret on drums, The <b>Flairs</b> recorded their cover of [...] "Roll Over Beethoven" [...] firstly released on the Palms record label. With this recording, next in the same year re-released on the Jamie record label under the name The Velaires, the group scored a top ten hit nationally (the song posted at #1 in the Los Angeles area, according to Billboard Magazine.) Appearances on American Bandstand and national tours with Dick Clark's Caravan of Stars followed, as well as many subsequent releases on eight different labels.|$|R
