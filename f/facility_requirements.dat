50|$|In 2016, Davis won the {{endorsement}} of Texans for Pro-Life. In 2011, Davis voted against a bill to require physicians to conduct intra-vaginal sonograms, prior to even pharmaceutically induced abortions, citing her opposition to legislative interference in the doctor-patient relationship. Davis likened this legislation to the government takeover of the doctor-patient relationship by Obamacare, and as a Republican who believes in limited government, personal freedom and individual responsibility, Davis said the government should not practice medicine. Davis voted for a bill that prohibits the state from funding facilities that perform abortions. In 2013, she voted against a bill that increases abortion <b>facility</b> <b>requirements,</b> regulates the administration of abortion inducing drugs, and prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of gestation. Davis stated {{at the time that}} the bill constituted a de facto ban on abortions and would not withstand constitutional scrutiny. Shortly after the ban was enacted, the law was indeed held unconstitutional by a Texas Federal Judge, though that decision is now on appeal. During the 2013 debate on the abortion restrictions bill, Davis offered an amendment to the abortion bill which retained the 20-week ban, but which deleted the unconstitutional facility restrictions, and instead incorporated exceptions for cases of rape, incest, danger to the mother’s life and severe fetal abnormalities.|$|E

This program is co-designed between the two institutions to promote better success for aboriginal students.

[...] Memorial University continues to secure access to the Post Secondary Student Support Program (PSSSP) for members of the federation of the Newfoundland Indians and Labrador Métis Nation.

In mid November 2007, thirty bursaries were given to Métis students attending university. [...] Memorial University's Faculty of Education has developed a distance education program for Nunavut students as well as a professional development certificate program for their teachers. [...] The College of the North Atlantic’s new Integrated Nursing Access Program allows Inuit students to stay in Labrador for the 3-year access program and the 2nd year of the BN (Collaborative) Program.

40|$|THE {{importance}} {{of space and}} <b>facility</b> <b>requirements</b> for {{elementary and secondary schools}} has been minimized, to some extent, in the planning phase of schoolhouse construction. This aspect of planning needs to be studied constantly in order that the optimum advantages may be derived from the educational environment of our remodeled or new school build-ings. The requirements of space and facilities vary with curriculums, but there are certain features among the activities within the different types of schools which are amenable to standardization. Due to the somewhat unspecialized nature of the work conducted within the elementary school, the treatment of the problem of interior space and <b>facility</b> <b>requirements</b> in the elementary school is quite general in this chapter. This is in contrast to the more specific nature of the information advanced in treating the specialized requirements of the secondary school. This approach to the subject of space and <b>facility</b> <b>requirements</b> for both the elementary and secondary school is in no way inconsistent inasmuch as the specialized requirements of the secondary- and elementary-school buildings are similar in many respects.
