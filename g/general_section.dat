5|$|Early in October 1835, Yagan's {{head and}} the {{panoramic}} view were returned to Dale, then living in Liverpool. On 12 October he presented them to the Liverpool Royal Institution, where the head may have been displayed in a case along with some other preserved heads and wax models illustrating cranial anatomy. In 1894 the Institution's collections were dispersed, and Yagan's head was lent to the Liverpool Museum; it is thought {{not to have been}} put on display there. By the 1960s Yagan's head was badly deteriorated. In April 1964 the museum decided to dispose of it. It arranged burial of the head on 10 April 1964, together with a Peruvian mummy and a Māori head. They were buried in Everton Cemetery's <b>General</b> <b>Section</b> 16, grave number 296. In later years a number of burials were made around the grave. For example, in 1968 a local hospital buried directly over the box, 20 stillborn babies and two infants who died soon after birth.|$|E
25|$|To pave way {{for such}} {{reservation}} scheme, the Constitution of India was amended (the 93rd Constitutional Amendment, originally drafted as 104th Amendment Bill). In 2006, the UPA government promised to implement 27% reservation for OBCs in institutes {{of higher education}} (twenty central universities, the IITs, IIMs and AIIMS) after 2006 Assembly elections. This, if implemented, would reduce the seats for the <b>general</b> <b>section</b> of the population to less than 50.5% (since those for whom the quota is granted can compete with the <b>general</b> <b>section</b> also on merit).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{we discuss}} some {{necessary}} and sufficient {{conditions for a}} curve to be arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, {{in terms of its}} <b>general</b> hyperplane <b>section.</b> We obtain a characterization of the degree matrices that can occur for points in the plane that are the <b>general</b> plane <b>section</b> of a non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve of P 3. We prove that almost all the degree matrices with positive subdiagonal that occur for the <b>general</b> plane <b>section</b> of a non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve of P 3, arise also as degree matrices of some smooth, integral, non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve, and we characterize the exceptions. We give a necessary condition on the graded Betti numbers of the <b>general</b> plane <b>section</b> of an arithmetically Buchsbaum (non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay) curve in P n. For curves in P 3, we show that any set of Betti numbers that satisfy that condition can be realised as the Betti numbers of the <b>general</b> plane <b>section</b> of an arithmetically Buchsbaum, non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve. We also show that the matrices that arise as degree matrix of the <b>general</b> plane <b>section</b> of an arithmetically Buchsbaum, integral, (smooth) non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay space curve are exactly those that arise as degree matrix of the <b>general</b> plane <b>section</b> of an arithmetically Buchsbaum, non arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay space curve and have positive subdiagonal.

50|$|The Code {{is divided}} into sections, each section is labeled with an even number and a title. Sections 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, and 26 include rules that apply to {{installations}} in general; the remaining sections are supplementary and deal with installation methods in specific locations or situations. Some examples of <b>general</b> <b>sections</b> include: grounding and bonding, protection and control, conductors, and definitions. Some examples of supplementary sections include: wet locations, hazardous locations, patient care areas, emergency systems, and temporary installations. When interpreting the requirements for a particular installation, rules found in supplementary sections of the code amend or supersede the rules in <b>general</b> <b>sections</b> of the code.|$|R
