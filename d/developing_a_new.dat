5|$|In the 1960s, flocked Christmas {{trees in}} purple, gold, pink, and even black became popular.

Natural trees would return to favor in the 1970s when country arts and crafts became popular.|$|E

5|$|The {{intention}} was to rationalise the industry to cut costs, and the government offered incentives for amalgamation through promises of contracts for new aircraft orders for the armed forces. At the time, the RAF were looking to replace the English Electric Canberra light bomber in the long-range interdictor role, and the Hawker Hunter in the close air support role, while the Royal Navy sought an aircraft to assume the fleet air defence role from the de Havilland Sea Vixen. BAC, through its English Electric subsidiary, had begun <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> high-performance strike aircraft, the TSR-2, which was intended for long-range, low-level strike missions with conventional and tactical nuclear weapons, as well as tactical reconnaissance. Hawker Siddeley was also <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> aircraft, based on its P.1127 V/STOL demonstrator. The P.1154 was proposed as a supersonic version that could be marketed to both the RAF and Royal Navy to fulfil a number of roles: close air support, air superiority and fleet air defence.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{has been}} adapted into other media several times. An {{illustrated}} version was syndicated in newspapers in 1945. Warner Bros. produced a film version in 1949; Rand wrote the screenplay, and Gary Cooper played Roark. Critics panned the film, {{which did not}} recoup its budget; several directors and writers have considered <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> film adaptation. In 2014, Belgian theater director Ivo van Hove created a stage adaptation, which has received mostly positive reviews.|$|E

5|$|After {{developer}} MachineGames was founded, {{the employees}} all began brainstorming ideas, and pitching them to publishers. In June 2009, MachineGames owner ZeniMax Media acquired id Software {{and all of}} its property, including Doom, Quake and Wolfenstein. Bethesda Softworks, who had previously declined a pitch from MachineGames, suggested that they develop a new game from a franchise acquired by ZeniMax. MachineGames inquired about <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> game in the Wolfenstein series; the studio visited id Software, who approved of MachineGames' request for a new Wolfenstein game. By November 2010, paperwork was signed, allowing MachineGames to develop Wolfenstein: The New Order. Preliminary development lasted approximately three years.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{operation}} {{had been a}} failure, it demonstrated the range, flexibility and possibilities of airborne forces and glider operations, and also highlighted equipment failures that were rectified for later operations. This included <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> version of the Rebecca-Eureka homing device system, the Mk II, which was ready by 1943 and proved to be very successful when used in later airborne operations; during Operation Market Garden and Operation Varsity, aircraft that used the system reported a 95% success rate.|$|E
5|$|Defender was Williams Electronics' {{first attempt}} at <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> video game; the company's earlier game was a Pong clone. The {{popularity}} of coin-operated arcade games in 1979 spurred the company to shift its focus from pinball games to arcade games. The company chose Eugene Jarvis, who had a successful record of Williams pinball games, to head development. Larry DeMar, Sam Dicker, and Paul Dussault assisted Jarvis. At the time, Williams had a small staff and the management was unfamiliar with technology used for its electronic games. As a result, the staff was afforded {{a large amount of}} creative freedom.|$|E

5|$|During the 1970s, UK and France were <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{aircraft}} {{which could}} fill the RAF tactical strike and reconnaissance missions: the SEPECAT Jaguar was introduced into service in 1974, {{and led to}} a re-think of the Phantom's role as, at the same time, the limitations of the Lightning as an interceptor were becoming more apparent. The conversion of the RAF's FGR.2 squadrons to operate the Jaguar, combined with its use of the Blackburn Buccaneer, meant {{that it was possible to}} begin transferring Phantoms to operate purely as interceptors in the air defence role.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, Luka Ploče d.d. started <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{bulk cargo}} terminal, a new {{container}} terminal and a distribution center, implementing IT systems throughout port facilities and operations, and enhancing logistical support {{to increase the}} competitiveness of the Ploče transport route. Funding of €91million was approved on November 20, 2006, consisting of a €58.8million loan from the World Bank, a €11.2million loan from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and a provision of €21million by Croatia. By August 2010, €44.2M of the total had been spent, and the new container terminal was opened.|$|E

She was also confirmed as a primary voice actress in the feature film Hotel Transylvania, but {{dropped out of the}} project to coordinate a musical comeback in 2012.

5|$|In the mid-1930s, {{aviation}} design teams worldwide started <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> {{generation of}} all-metal, low-wing fighter aircraft.

They also featured refinements such as retractable undercarriages, fully enclosed cockpits, low drag and all-metal wings (all introduced on civil airliners years before but slow to be adopted by the military, who favoured the biplane's simplicity and manoeuvrability).|$|E
5|$|Once the Thrud strip had run {{its course}} in White Dwarf, Critchlow worked on other comics {{including}} the Judge Dredd/Batman crossover story The Ultimate Riddle, first published in 1995.

Critchlow was <b>developing</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> style based on line-drawings with computer colouring, but having been pigeon-holed as a painter {{did not believe that}} {{he would be able to}} interest anyone in this very different style.|$|E

The room, with its stone walls, is a remnant of the original building, with foundations dating back to the Saxon era. The rest of the mansion was added on over the centuries.|$|E
