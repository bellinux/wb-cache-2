25|$|Childers {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and resumed his position in the House of Commons. His reputation as an influential author gave the couple access to the political establishment, which Molly relished, {{but at the same time}} she set to work to rid Childers of his already faltering imperialism. In her turn Molly developed a strong admiration for Britain, its institutions and, as she then saw it, its willingness to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the interests of smaller nations against the great. Over the next seven years they lived comfortably in their rented flat in Chelsea, supported by Childers's salary—he had received promotion to the position of parliamentary Clerk of Petitions in 1903—his continuing writings and, not least, generous benefactions from Dr Osgood.|$|E
25|$|The {{origins of}} modern-day Austria {{date back to}} the time of the Habsburg dynasty, when the vast {{majority}} of the country was a part of the Holy Roman Empire. From the time of the Reformation, many northern German princes, resenting the authority of the Emperor, used Protestantism as a flag of rebellion. The Thirty Years War, the influence of the Kingdom of Sweden and Kingdom of France, the rise of the Kingdom of Prussia, and the Napoleonic invasions all weakened the power of the Emperor in the north of Germany, but in the south, and in non-German areas of the Empire, the Emperor and Catholicism maintained control. During the 17th and 18th centuries, Austria retained its position as one of the great powers of Europe and, in response to the coronation of Napoleon as the Emperor of the French, the Austrian Empire was officially proclaimed in 1804. Following Napoleon's defeat, Prussia emerged as Austria's chief competitor for rule of a Greater Germany. Austria's defeat by Prussia at the Battle of Königgrätz, during the Austro-Prussian War of 1866, cleared the way for Prussia to assert control over the rest of Germany. In 1867, the empire was reformed into Austria-Hungary. After the defeat of France in the 1870-1 Franco-Prussian War, Austria was excluded from the new German Empire, although in the following decades, its politics, and its foreign policy, increasingly converged with those of the Prussian-led Empire. During the 1914 July Crisis that followed the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria on June 28, Austria-Hungary, emboldened by a pledge of German support, on July 28 declared war on Serbia because that country had not fully complied with an Austrian ultimatum. Austria was thus the first to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> the July Crisis, which would ultimately escalate into World War I.|$|E

500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} got underway, the largest hurdle for the campaign was finances. Polling numbers showed Humphrey trailing Nixon, causing donations to decrease. President Johnson refused to {{use the power of}} his office to help raise money, although many speculated that the tardiness of the Convention, scheduled to coincide with Johnson's birthday, contributed to the issue. To stay afloat, several loans were made, which eventually accounted for half of the $11.6 million used by Humphrey throughout {{the general election}}. Campaign workers decided that no money would be spent on radio or television advertising until the final three weeks of the election. In September, President Johnson showed his support for Humphrey by giving what was described as the strongest endorsement of the campaign when he asked Texas Democrats to throw their support behind the Vice President. However, Johnson did not give his official endorsement until an October 10 radio address. Meanwhile, Humphrey campaigned in New York where he labeled Nixon a [...] "Hawk," [...] stating that the former Vice President [...] "wanted to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> (<b>in</b> Vietnam) in 1954." [...] At a later stop in Buffalo, Humphrey was met by protesters.|$|E

2500|$|There are {{allegations}} that decisions to <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>war</b> <b>in</b> Iraq were motivated {{at least partially}} by oil interests; for example, British newspaper The Independent reported that the [...] "Bush administration is heavily involved in writing Iraq's oil law" [...] which would [...] "allow Western oil companies contracts to pump oil out of Iraq up to 30 years, and the profits would be tax-free."
