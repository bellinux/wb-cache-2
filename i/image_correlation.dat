25|$|PICS is a {{powerful}} analysis tool that resolves correlations on the nanometer length and millisecond timescale. Adapted from methods of spatio-temporal <b>image</b> <b>correlation</b> spectroscopy, it exploits the high positional accuracy of single-particle tracking. While conventional tracking methods break down if multiple particle trajectories intersect, this method works in principle for arbitrarily large molecule densities and dynamical parameters (e.g. diffusion coefficients, velocities) as long as individual molecules can be identified. It is computationally cheap and robust and allows one to identify and quantify motions (e.g. diffusion, active transport, confined diffusion) within an ensemble of particles, without any a priori knowledge about the dynamics.|$|E

40|$|International audienceShape Memory Alloys (SMA) undergo an austenite-martensite solid-solid phase {{transformation}} which confers its super-elastic and shape memory behaviors. Phase transformation can be induced either by stress or temperature changes, thus indicating a strong thermomechanical coupling. Until now, the {{increasing use of}} SMA for complex applications requires a robust multiphysic and multiaxial modeling of phenomena governing their behaviors. 1 D tensile loading test is applied to a small strip specimen made of NiTi SMA (Ni 49. 8 at%). During the tensile test, {{phase transformation}} of SMA occurs in the form of strain localization bands. Despite of the progress in Digital <b>Images</b> <b>Correlation</b> techniques (DIC), the measurement of strain localization remains challenging for small size samples addressed in this study.

2500|$|A natural {{extension}} of the temporal and spatial correlation versions is spatio-temporal ICS (STICS). [...] In STICS there is no explicit averaging in space or time (only the averaging inherent in correlation). [...] In systems with non-isotropic motion (e.g. directed flow, asymmetric diffusion), STICS can extract the directional information. [...] A variation that {{is closely related to}} STICS (by the Fourier transform) is k-space <b>Image</b> <b>Correlation</b> Spectroscopy (kICS).|$|E
2500|$|Any of the <b>image</b> <b>correlation</b> {{spectroscopy}} {{methods can}} also be performed on a spinning disk confocal microscope, which in practice can obtain faster imaging speeds compared to a laser scanning confocal microscope. [...] This approach has recently been applied to diffusion in a spatially varying complex environment, producing a pixel resolution map of a diffusion coefficient. The spatial mapping of diffusion with FCS has subsequently been extended to the TIRF system. Spatial mapping of dynamics using correlation techniques had been applied before, but only at sparse points or at coarse resolution.|$|E

[...] <b>Image</b> <b>Correlation</b> Spectroscopy and its variations all were implemented on a scanning confocal or scanning two photon microscope, but transfer to other microscopes, like a spinning disk confocal microscope. [...] Raster ICS (RICS), and position sensitive FCS (PSFCS) incorporate the time delay between {{parts of the}} image scan into the analysis. [...] Also, low-dimensional scans (e.g. a circular ring)only possible on a scanning systemcan access time scales between single point and full image measurements.
