25|$|Young spiders do not {{generally}} build yellow-colored silk, {{and the young}} Nephila themselves can be easily mistaken for young Orchard Spiders (Leucauge) in general color and shape (both genera sport silver stripes or patches on their abdomens, described in some references {{as a form of}} <b>heat</b> <b>control).</b> The best distinction between Leucauge and Nephila juveniles is web structure: Leucauge tends to build a horizontal orb that is a perfect circle, whereas Nephila build vertical, elliptical orbs that are incomplete (missing the portion of the orb over the hub, the center where the spider sits). Nephila seem to prefer more open habitat such as second-growth scrub or forest edges. Fences or building overhangs often do just as nicely.|$|E

500|$|The 2007 {{report by}} Platt Byard Dovell White Architects {{evaluating}} the condition and context {{for many of}} Vassar's buildings found Mudd to be [...] "by far Vassar's most interesting and most important post-Modern building." [...] A contemporary review in Architecture commented that Mudd [...] "responds {{on a variety of}} levels to its context, but it does so without sacrificing its own unique and powerful identity." [...] Margaret Gaskie also praised the building's placement and contextualization among its fellow structures in a 1986 issue of Architectural Record: [...] "the scale of the structure beneath its outcroppings is sympathetic to the existing buildings in the quad, and its mass, though larger, [...] appropriate to its role as a gateway between them and the central campus". She went on to positively comment on the building's aesthetics, saying, [...] "the eye can feast on the mingled sparkle and luminosity drawn from minimal outdoor exposures used to maximum effect. In more public areas, where crisp glass-block and lucent glass ignite clear deep-timbered tones and pretty pastels, the feast becomes a banquet." [...] Crosbie in Architecture noted [...] "some instances of shoddy drywall work and sloppy painting" [...] but otherwise praised the building's [...] "bare-bones" [...] and [...] "nuts and bolts" [...] interior as functional and environmentally friendly. The Platt Byard Dovell White report found that Mudd's glass walls [...] "seem to function particularly poorly" [...] as a passive <b>heat</b> <b>control</b> system but otherwise noted that the structure's expressive postmodernist ambitions marked it as [...] "a strong, compact if busy building [...] makes it more than a bit of a tour de force." [...] Mudd was awarded first place in a 1988 competition run by Pittsburgh Corning for its design.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Traditionally, human {{vision is}} applied to {{locating}} {{the region of the}} asphalt pavement defects. This will bring large variations for <b>heating</b> <b>control</b> of the microwave maintenance vehicle due to a shortage of the accurate control data. In this paper, a novel machine vision-based method was proposed to produce the control data precisely for the <b>heating</b> <b>control.</b> First, a scheme of the microwave <b>heating</b> <b>control</b> system based on machine vision was proposed for the microwave maintenance vehicle. Then, for the image distortion caused by the lens, the cubic polynomial warping algorithm and the reprojection transformation method were used to rectify it. Third, from the rectified image, the automatic and the manual method extracting control data were put forward. Last, matching with the obtained control data, a circuit design was demonstrated. Product testing proves that the proposed machine vision-based method is not only prompt and accurate in locating asphalt defects, but also quite effective in energy saving...|$|R

40|$|This conference {{paper is}} {{published}} with kind {{permission of the}} conference organiser. This paper presents measurements of householders’ manual interaction with their <b>heating</b> <b>controls.</b> The results demonstrate the importance of measuring heating use behaviour directly {{rather than relying on}} thermostat and timer settings or inferring heating use from internal temperature measurements. This is the first time, to the author’s knowledge, that manual heating interactions have been recorded. <b>Heating</b> <b>controls</b> will only save energy if used effectively, yet currently, little is known about how they are used. This paper describes an in-depth study of twelve UK residential properties that had new <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> installed. <b>Heating</b> system interactions with these controls, energy consumption and room temperatures were monitored for ten months from July 2014 to April 2015 inclusive, covering autumn and spring shoulder months and the winter heating season. These measured data were supported by a series of qualitative interviews with the households. The paper reports details of the householders’ heating system use, separating the occupants’ manual interactions with the controls from their pre-programmed heating schedules. The findings show that the participants had many manual interactions with their heating systems, even during scheduled heating periods; changing heating durations and demand temperatures. The results also identify that manual interactions with <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> occur more frequently during the winter season than in the shoulder months. The results have important implications relating to assumptions of set-point temperatures and schedule characteristics previously based only on self-reported use or measured internal temperature profiles...|$|R

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Engineering Doctorate and awarded by Brunel University. With housing in the UK responsible for {{over a quarter of}} all building related carbon dioxide (CO 2) emissions, it is becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the impact of occupant behaviour on such emissions. One area where occupant behaviour contributes largely towards emissions is space heating within domestic buildings. Despite technological improvements in the efficiency of <b>heating</b> systems, <b>controls</b> have become increasingly complex. Hence, {{there is a need to}} enable people to use their <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> effectively in order to help reduce the associated CO 2 emissions. This research found that significant numbers of people were excluded from using digital programmable thermostats, in particular people over 50 years old. The first study examined the scale of exclusion relating to digital programmable thermostats installed at a specific housing development. A second study explored in detail the reasons for exclusion from successfully programming a range of digital programmable thermostats. This was an in-depth usability study of <b>heating</b> <b>controls</b> that focused on the usability issues experienced by older people and was published in the Journal of Engineering Design. Based upon the outcomes of the first two studies a more inclusive <b>heating</b> <b>control</b> interface prototype was developed. The prototype demonstrated a reduction in both cognitive demands and associated user exclusion. Task success rates increased by 56. 3...|$|R
