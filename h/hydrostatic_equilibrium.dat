5|$|In {{addition}} to its mass and modeled geochemistry, researchers have also examined Enceladus's shape to determine if it is differentiated. Porco et al. (2006) used limb measurements to determine that its shape, assuming <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> is consistent with an undifferentiated interior, in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence. However, the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> and may have rotated faster {{at some point in}} the recent past (with a differentiated interior). Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low, indicating that the core contains water in {{addition to}} silicates.|$|E

5|$|Vesta, the next-most-massive {{body in the}} {{asteroid}} belt after Ceres, is roughly spherical, deviating mainly because of massive impacts that formed Rheasilvia and Veneneia crater after it solidified.

5|$|A planet's {{defining}} {{physical characteristic}} {{is that it}} is massive enough for the force of its own gravity to dominate over the electromagnetic forces binding its physical structure, leading to a state of <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> This effectively means that all planets are spherical or spheroidal. Up to a certain mass, an object can be irregular in shape, but beyond that point, which varies depending on the chemical makeup of the object, gravity begins to pull an object towards its own centre of mass until the object collapses into a sphere.|$|E

40|$|We derive <b>hydrostatic,</b> {{radiative}} <b>equilibrium</b> {{models for}} passive disks surrounding T Tauri stars. Each disk is encased by an optically {{thin layer of}} superheated dust grains. This layer re-emits directly to space about half the stellar energy it absorbs. The other half is emitted inward and regulates the interior temperature of the disk. The heated disk flares. As a consequence, it absorbs more stellar radiation, especially at large radii, than a flat disk would. The portion of the SED contributed by the disk is fairly flat throughout the thermal infrared. At fixed frequency, the contribution from the surface layer exceeds that from the interior by about a factor 3 and is emitted at more than {{an order of magnitude}} greater radius. Spectral features from dust grains in the superheated layer appear in emission if the disk is viewed nearly face-on.

Other planetary satellites (like Earth and its moon) might be in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> but would still not have been defined as a component of a double planet, since the barycenter of the system lies within the more massive celestial body (the Earth).|$|E
5|$|The energy {{generation}} of the Sun is based upon thermonuclear fusion of hydrogen into helium. This occurs in the core region of the star using the proton–proton chain reaction process. Because there is no convection in the solar core, the helium concentration builds up in that region without being distributed throughout the star. The temperature {{at the core of}} the Sun is too low for nuclear fusion of helium atoms through the triple-alpha process, so these atoms do not contribute to the net {{energy generation}} that is needed to maintain <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> of the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{methods for}} {{numerical}} solving plane and axially symmetric problems on equilibrium shapes of a capillary surface are presented. The methods possess a high order of approximation on a nonuniform grid. They {{are easy to}} realize, fairly universal and suitable for constructing not only simply connected but also doubly connected and disconnected surfaces, including strongly curved ones. It is shown that the iterative algorithms constructed are absolutely stable at each iteration. The condition for convergence of iterations is obtained {{within the framework of}} a linear theory. To describe peak-shaped configurations of a magnetic fluid in a high magnetic field, an algorithm of generation of adaptive grid nodes in accordance with the surface curvature is proposed. The methods have been tested for the well-known problems of capillary <b>hydrostatics</b> on <b>equilibrium</b> shapes of a drop adjacent to the horizontal rotating plate under gravity, and of an isolated magnetic-fluid drop in a high uniform magnetic field. It has been established that they adequately respond to the physical phenomenon of a crisis of equilibrium shapes, i. e., they can be adopted to investigate the stability of equilibrium states of a capillary surfac...|$|R
5|$|The exact mass-luminosity {{relationship}} {{depends on}} how efficiently energy can be transported from the core to the surface. A higher opacity has an insulating effect that retains more energy at the core, so the star {{does not need to}} produce as much energy to remain in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium.</b> By contrast, a lower opacity means energy escapes more rapidly and the star must burn more fuel to remain in equilibrium. Note, however, that a sufficiently high opacity can result in energy transport via convection, which changes the conditions needed to remain in equilibrium.|$|E
5|$|There are 19 natural {{satellites}} in the Solar System {{that are}} known to be massive enough to be close to <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> which Alan Stern calls satellite planets. However, several of these were once in equilibrium but are no longer: these include all of the moons listed for Saturn apart from Titan and Rhea. Other moons that were once in equilibrium but are no longer very round, such as Saturn's Phoebe, are not included. Satellites are listed first in order from the Sun, and second in order from their parent body.|$|E
5|$|When {{an object}} is in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium,</b> a global layer of liquid {{covering}} its surface would form a liquid {{surface of the}} same shape as the body, apart from small-scale surface features such as craters and fissures. If the body does not rotate, {{it will be a}} sphere, but the faster it rotates, the more oblate or even scalene it becomes. If such a rotating body were to be heated until it melted, its overall shape would not change when liquid. The extreme example of a non-spherical body in <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>equilibrium</b> is , which is twice as long along its major axis as it is at the poles. If the body has a massive nearby companion, then tidal forces come into effect as well, distorting it into a prolate spheroid. An example of this is Jupiter's moon Io, which is the most volcanically active body in the Solar System due to effects of tidal heating. Tidal forces also cause a body's rotation to gradually become tidally locked, such that it always presents the same face to its companion. An extreme example of this is the Pluto–Charon system, where both bodies are tidally locked to each other. Earth's Moon is also tidally locked, as are many satellites of the gas giants.|$|E

The structure of the internal atmosphere is determined {{on the basis of the}} <b>hydrostatic</b> and radiative <b>equilibrium</b> conditions of the tube embedded in an external atmosphere.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of capillary pressure measurements by the multi-rate centrifuge technique in water-wet and oil-wet carbonate core plugs. The time to achieve <b>hydrostatic</b> saturation <b>equilibrium</b> was experimentally investigated at each speed step. The time to reach equilibrium was dependent on the wettability preference and absolute permeability of the core samples, and spinning time varied from {{a few days to}} over a month at some rotational speeds. Capillary pressure curve measurements by an automated data acquisition centrifuge requiring little or no human intervention is reported. The high degree of automation eliminated the chance for biased production measurements and enhanced the reliability and consistency of the obtained experimental data. The high accuracy in the camera device on the centrifuge provided accurate production measurements, where very small volumes changes (~ 0. 01 cc) were registered. Although the automatic centrifuge provided excellent accuracy in production measurements, it was still limited to average saturation measurements during centrifugation. However, the combination of high accuracy and high frequency data acquisition provided high-quality transient data from the rapid saturation changes associated with increase in RPM. A commercially available core analysis simulator was used to history match the experimental data in an implicit method to determine the capillary pressure curves...|$|R
