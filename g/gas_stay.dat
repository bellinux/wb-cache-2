40|$|Suppression of seed {{germination}} at supraoptimal high temperature (thermoinhibiton) during summer {{is crucial for}} Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) to establish vegetative and reproductive growth in appropriate seasons. Abscisic acid (ABA) and gibberellins (GAs) are well known {{to be involved in}} germination control, but it remains unknown how these hormone actions (metabolism and responsiveness) are altered at high temperature. Here, we show that ABA levels in imbibed seeds are elevated at high temperature and that this increase is correlated with up-regulation of the zeaxanthin epoxidase gene ABA 1 /ZEP and three 9 -cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenase genes, NCED 2, NCED 5, and NCED 9. Reverse-genetic studies show that NCED 9 plays a major and NCED 5 and NCED 2 play relatively minor roles in high temperature-induced ABA synthesis and germination inhibition. We also show that bioactive <b>GAs</b> <b>stay</b> at low levels at high temperature, presumably through suppression of GA 20 -oxidase genes, GA 20 ox 1, GA 20 ox 2, and GA 20 ox 3, and GA 3 -oxidase genes, GA 3 ox 1 and GA 3 ox 2. Thermoinhibition-tolerant germination of loss-of-function mutants of GA negative regulators, SPINDLY (SPY) and RGL 2, suggests that repression of GA signaling is required for thermoinibition. Interestingly, ABA-deficient aba 2 - 2 mutant seeds show significant expression of GA synthesis genes and repression of SPY expression even at high temperature. In addition, the thermoinhibition-resistant germination phenotype of aba 2 - 1 seeds is suppressed by a GA biosynthesis inhibitor, paclobutrazol. We conclude that high temperature stimulates ABA synthesis and represses GA synthesis and signaling through the action of ABA in Arabidopsis seeds...|$|E

A laminar jet of sulphur hexafluoride (SF_ 6) is used to produce the heavy gas cylinder. Planar laser induced fluorescence (PLIF) is used to visualize the flow. In viewing the PLIF images it is discovered that the vorticity that early on resides on the boundary between the two gasses, separates from the cylinder to form a pair of vortices. Subsequently these vortices wrap the heavy gas around them. This process is quite different from what is observed when the cylinder is lighter than its surroundings. Similar experiments with helium (part 1 of this series) showed that a small amount light <b>gas</b> <b>stays</b> with the vorticity, eventually becoming part of the vortex cores.

The impulse for the use of TiO 2 as photocatalyst was given by Fujishima and Honda in 1972 [5].

In the eighties, organic pollution in water was also decomposed by adding TiO 2 and under influence of UV-light (with wave lengths lower than 387  nm). The application of TiO 2, in the photoactive crystal form anatase, as air purifying material originated in Japan in 1996 (see e.g. [6]).

The behavior is qualitatively different from the elementary modes, where the mode frequencies are independent of the temperature as long as the <b>gas</b> <b>stays</b> in the hydrodynamic regime. Our results are compared to theoretical predictions based on Landau's two-fluid theory and available experimental knowledge of the equation of state.

The luminosity and surface brightness distribution is in excellent agreement with predictions by recent, cosmological galaxy formation models. Predicted Lyα emission, associated with “cold ” accretion of filamentary gas onto galaxies, is discussed in relation to Lyα “blobs”. Finally, the predicted evolution of the Tully-Fisher relation, going from z= 0 to 1, is discussed in relation to recent observations. Cosmology – Galaxies – Numerical Simulations 1. X-ray emission from disk galaxy haloes Disk galaxies continue forming to the present day, as evidenced by, e. g., infall of high-velocity clouds and satellite galaxies. Self-consistent models of disk galaxy formation predict that, at present, part of the inflowing gas originates as hot and dilute, low-metallicity halo gas, slowly cooling out and accreting onto the disk (e. g., Abadi et al. 2003, Sommer-Larsen et al. 2003, Governato et al. 2004, Robertson et al. 2004). The X-ray luminosity of the hot halo is predicted to increase strongly with galaxy mass, and the haloes of the most massive galaxies should be detectable (Toft et al. 2002, Rasmussen et al. 2004). Searches for this hot halo gas have so far failed to detect such soft X-rays, challenging galaxy formation theory.

40|$|This work is {{motivated}} by the growing interest in injecting carbon dioxide into deep geological formations {{as a means of}} avoiding its atmospheric emissions and consequent global warming. Ideally, the injected greenhouse <b>gas</b> <b>stays</b> in the injection zone for a geologic time, eventually dissolves in the formation brine and remains trapped by mineralization. However, one of the potential problems associated with the geologic method of sequestration is that naturally present or inadvertently created conduits in the cap rock may result in a gas leakage from primary storage. Even in a supercritical state, the carbon dioxide viscosity and density are lower than those of the formation brine. Buoyancy tends to drive the leaked CO{sub 2 } plume upward. Theoretical and experimental studies of buoyancy-driven supercritical CO{sub 2 } flow, including estimation of time scales associated with plume evolution and migration, are critical for developing technology, monitoring policy, and regulations for safe carbon dioxide geologic sequestration. In this study, we obtain simple estimates of vertical plume propagation velocity taking into account the density and viscosity contrast between CO{sub 2 } and brine. We describe buoyancy-driven countercurrent flow of two immiscible phases by a Buckley-Leverett type model. The model predicts that a plume of supercritical carbon dioxide in a homogeneous water-saturated porous medium does not migrate upward like a bubble in bulk water. Rather, it spreads upward until it reaches a seal or until it becomes immobile. A simple formula requiring no complex numerical calculations describes the velocity of plume propagation. This solution is a simplification of a more comprehensive theory of countercurrent plume migration (Silin et al., 2007). In a layered reservoir, the simplified solution predicts a slower plume front propagation relative to a homogeneous formation with the same harmonic mean permeability. In contrast, the model yields much higher plume propagation estimates in a high-permeability conduit like a vertical fracture...|$|R

These emission-absorption spectrum pairs are used to study the temperature of the interstellar neutral hydrogen in the outer disk of the Milky Way, outside the solar circle, to a radius of 25 kpc. The cool neutral medium is distributed in radius and height above the plane with very similar parameters to the warm neutral medium. In particular, the ratio of the emission to the absorption, which gives the mean spin temperature of the <b>gas,</b> <b>stays</b> nearly constant with radius to 25 kpc radius. This suggests that the mixture of cool and warm phases is a robust quantity, and that the changes in the interstellar environment do not force the H I into a regime where there is only one temperature allowed. The mixture of atomic gas phases in the outer disk is roughly 15 % to 20 % cool (40 K to 60 K), the rest warm, corresponding to mean spin temperature 250 to 400 K. The Galactic warp appears clearly in the absorption data, and other features on the familiar longitude-velocity diagram have analogs in absorption with even higher contrast than for 21 -cm emission. In the third and fourth Galactic quadrants the plane is quite flat, in absorption as in emission, in contrast to the strong warp in the first and second quadrants.
