5|$|The San Diego Chargers got 16 first downs, {{compared}} to 5 for the Buccaneers. Chargers {{players and coaches}} praised the Buccaneers’ defense, who held them to 9 points until the final three minutes of the game, saying that they played the equivalent of five quarters. Three Tampa Bay quarterbacks completed a combined 3 of 8 passes for −4 yards. Buccaneers receiver Bob Moore said, “We’re at rock bottom now...but <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> pointing a finger, we’ll go 0–14”. The Chargers finished with 325 yards of offense to the Buccaneers’ 125. Inconsistent blocking was blamed for the offensive problems, a situation that was not helped by the injury to tackle Dave Reavis. Mercury Morris, who had been picked up on waivers by the Chargers from the Miami Dolphins after the Buccaneers’ preseason game against the Dolphins, commented that the difference in Buccaneers’ offensive line protection between the two games was like watching two different teams. The Buccaneers’ lack of speed was also noticeable. The loss {{marked the first time}} since 1961 that a professional football team was shut out {{in the first two games}} of the season, when the Oakland Raiders were shut out by the same two teams in the same order.|$|E
25|$|A {{consequence}} of sensitivity to initial conditions is that <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> {{with a limited}} amount of information about the system (as is usually the case in practice), then beyond a certain time the system is no longer predictable. This is most familiar in the case of weather, which is generally predictable only about a week ahead. Of course, {{this does not mean that}} we cannot say anything about events far in the future; some restrictions on the system are present. With weather, we know that the temperature will not naturally reach 100°C or fall to -130°C on earth (during the current geologic era), but we can't say exactly what day will have the hottest temperature of the year.|$|E

I want nothing more to do with you," [...] and left. According to the coach, Muransky and Edwards were the only two who played with intensity against Wisconsin, and Bo left it to them to motivate the rest of the team. Muransky issued a challenge to the offense on the night before the following week's game: [...] "I looked at everyone and said, 'If we continue to play as great individuals, we'll continue to lose. <b>If</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> to play as a great team, we'll start winning." [...] The next day, the Wolverines beat #1 ranked Notre Dame, 257.|$|E

[...] He stated: [...] "It {{would be a terrible}} precedent <b>if</b> <b>we</b> <b>start</b> moving backwards into the era in which we are seeing military coups as a means of political transition, rather than democratic elections." [...] Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, however, equivocated, saying that [...] "We do think that this has evolved into a coup" [...] and noting that under U.S. law, officially declaring a coup would oblige the U.S. to cut off most foreign aid to Honduras." [...] Cutting off aid was seen as a possibility {{in the days after the}} coup, and State Department Director of Policy Planning Anne-Marie Slaughter urged Clinton to [...] "take bold action" [...] and to [...] "find that [...] coup was a ‘military coup’ under U.S. law." [...] Nevertheless, Clinton did not do so, and the U.S. never formally declared that a coup had occurred. By November 2009, the U.S. [...] "focused on pushing for elections" [...] in the country. In September 2009, the Board of the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation, headed by Clinton, cut off $11 million in aid to the Honduran government in the wake of the coup, and suspended another $4 million in planned contributions to a road project. From 2009 to mid-2016, however, the U.S. provided about $200 million in military and police aid to Honduras, a controversial decision given the violence in Honduras and the government's human rights violations.|$|E
