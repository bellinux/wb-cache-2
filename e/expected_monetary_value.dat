Although resource allocation decisions are based on many factors, administrators must always consider the financial implications of their decisions.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a decision tree to evaluate the economic impact of different durations of intramammary treatment for the first case of mild or moderate clinical mastitis (CM) occurring in early lactation with various scenarios of pathogen distributions and use of on-farm culture. The tree included 2 decision and 3 probability events. The first decision evaluated use of on-farm culture (OFC; 2 programs using OFC and 1 not using OFC) and the second decision evaluated treatment strategies (no intramammary antimicrobials or antimicrobials administered for 2, 5, or 8 d). The tree included probabilities for the distribution of etiologies (gram-positive, gram-negative, or no growth), bacteriological cure, and recurrence. The economic consequences of mastitis included costs of diagnosis and initial treatment, additional treatments, labor, discarded milk, milk production losses due to clinical and subclinical mastitis, culling, and transmission of infection to other cows (only for CM caused by Staphylococcus aureus). Pathogen-specific estimates for bacteriological cure and milk losses were used. The economically optimal path for several scenarios was determined by comparison of <b>expected</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>values.</b> For most scenarios, the optimal economic strategy was to treat CM caused by gram-positive pathogens for 2 d and to avoid antimicrobials for CM cases caused by gram-negative pathogens or when no pathogen was recovered. Use of extended intramammary antimicrobial therapy (5 or 8 d) resulted in the least <b>expected</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>values...</b>|$|R

40|$|Using {{computerized}} decision-tree {{analysis and}} simulation modelling to evaluate control and eradication strategies for pseudorabies virus (PRV) three alternative actions were {{considered for a}} hypothetical 100 -sow, farrow-to-finish operation: (1) depopulation-repopulation, (2) test-and-removal of seropositives (TR), and (3) vaccination (of the entire herd or of sows only). The <b>expected</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>values</b> for the vaccination and TR alternatives were similar, which {{was consistent with the}} long-standing controversy over the best strategy for dealing with PRV. When the prevalence rate or PRV was ≤ 57 % TR was optimum; otherwise, vaccination of sows only was recommended. Sensitivity analysis was performed to determine how modifications in some of the original assumptions affected the <b>expected</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>values</b> of each strategy. When higher gross margins for the producer were assumed, TR was preferred at all prevalence rates. Vaccination was preferred when lower gross margins, lower vaccination costs, or better protective effect of PRV vaccines on reproductive performance were assumed. The use of gene-deleted vaccines in conjunction with the TR strategy was also evaluated. When this option was available, TR was favoured at any prevalence rate (TR alone when the prevalence was ≤ 20 %, or combined with gene-deleted vaccination at prevalences > 20 %). Depopulation-repopulation was not the best option under any circumstance. It is concluded that once formulated, a decision-tree analysis can be adapted to the prevailing economic or epidemiological conditions and is a useful tool in the PRV decision-making process.

40|$|Time, {{cost and}} quality {{achievements}} on large-scale construction projects are uncertain because of technological constraints, involvement of many stakeholders, long durations, large capital requirements and improper scope definitions. Projects that {{are exposed to}} such an uncertain environment can effectively be managed with the application of risk management throughout the project life cycle. Risk is by nature subjective. However, managing risk subjectively poses the danger of non-achievement of project goals. Moreover, risk analysis of the overall project also poses the danger of developing inappropriate responses. This article demonstrates a quantitative approach to construction risk management through an analytic hierarchy process (AHP) and decision tree analysis. The entire project is classified to form a few work packages. With the involvement of project stakeholders, risky work packages are identified. As all the risk factors are identified, their effects are quantified by determining probability (using AHP) and severity (guess estimate). Various alternative responses are generated, listing the cost implications of mitigating the quantified risks.

40|$|This study {{proposes a}} {{probabilistic}} decision-making support model (?Green Tree?), created in Microsoft Excel, to assist operators of marginal assets in prioritizing well workover decisions. Such a tool can help operators of legacy, low volume {{oil and gas}} assets to maximize their asset value by allocating capital towards the best well workover options to achieve equitable production increases. The framework for this model was constructed by following interventions taken in a marginal oil field in the Permian Basin from {{the time it was}} acquired in 2013 through 2016. The Green Tree decision model quantifies historic uncertainty in outcomes and uses the probabilistic present values of all interventions to display the optimum path value in a decision tree. Relatively few inputs are needed for the decision tree to show an optimum intervention path. These inputs include historic production data for the field, service costs for each wellbore workover, anticipated production increase from each workover, and expected probabilities for each intervention based off of the operator?s historical results. Once the inputs have been entered, the user is able to manually adjust the projected commodity prices and see the corresponding changes in the optimum path value. The Green Tree is applied to the Permian basin asset to identify the optimum sequence of interventions, revealing the risk adjusted upside to the base case PV 10 for the field calculated in the workbook. A summation of the <b>expected</b> <b>monetary</b> <b>values</b> (EMVs) from several interventions can be used to estimate the total upside value to the asset owner. The tool developed here may benefit marginal well producers in evaluating asset value when looking at an acquisition or divestiture. Lastly, posterior probabilities can be used in this model as the results of actual workovers in the field are examined, adjusting the tree in real time to account for any changes in the outcome of probabilities or production responses...|$|R

Generally, the EMV is a very moderate amount, even when a large number of games is played. It is of the same order as people are prepared to offer to play the game. There is thus no paradox.

40|$|Abstract. The Value of Information (VOI) during {{appraisal}} {{and development}} of petroleum fields is an economic criterion used in decision-making process, which involves the quantification of uncertainties and economic evaluation of several scenarios. Some methodologies have been proposed to evaluate the VOI, however they consider only one or just a few possible production strategies, oversimplifying the problem and underestimating the VOI. A new methodology has been proposed to evaluate the VOI based on the simulation of several reservoir models considering the uncertain attributes and some models (Geological Representative Models – GRM) are selected to represent the geological uncertainties. The production strategy of each GRM is optimized and the possible scenarios from the additional information are considered and the VOI is obtained through the <b>Expected</b> <b>Monetary</b> <b>Value</b> with and without information.

With sea level rise projections ranging from 0. 1 meters to 2 meters by the year 2100, there are concerns but little action being taken to adapt and prepare.

Girls from single-sex schools are as likely to choose the real-stakes gamble as boys from either coed or single sex schools, and more likely than coed girls. Moreover, gender di¤erences in preferences for risk-taking are sensitive to the gender mix of the experimental group, with girls being more likely to choose risky outcomes when assigned to all-girl groups.
