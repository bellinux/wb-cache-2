50|$|Mixtures {{that are}} richer than {{stoichiometric}} allow for greater peak engine power when using vaporized liquid fuel {{due to the}} mixture {{not being able to}} reach a perfectly homogenized state so extra fuel is added to ensure all oxygen is burned producing maximum power. The ideal mixture in this type of operation depends on the individual engine. For example, engines with forced induction such as turbochargers and superchargers typically require a richer mixture under wide open throttle than naturally aspirated engines. Forced induction engines can be catastrophically damaged by burning too lean for too long. The leaner the air-fuel mixture, the higher the combustion temperature is inside the cylinder. Too high a temperature will destroy an engine - melting the pistons and valves. This can happen if one ports the head and/or manifolds or increase boost without compensating by installing larger or more injectors, and/or increasing the fuel pressure to a sufficient level. Conversely, engine performance can be lessened by increasing fueling without increasing air flow into the engine.Furthermore, if an engine is leaned to the point where its exhaust gas temperature starts to fall, its cylinder head temperature will also fall. This is only recommended in the cruising configuration, never when accelerating hard, but is becoming increasingly popular in aviation circles, where the appropriate <b>engine</b> <b>monitoring</b> gauges are fitted and the fuel air mixture can be manually adjusted.|$|E

5000|$|The Z.1007 had a {{standard}} monoplane configuration, with a mid-set wing, single tail, retractable undercarriage and {{a crew of}} five or six. It had a wooden structure and a clean shape that was much more aerodynamic than the competing SM.79. The Z.1007 had three engines, with one engine in the nose and two in the wings. The trimotor design was a common feature of Italian aircraft of World War II. The aircraft had a slim fuselage as the two pilots sat in tandem rather than side-by-side as in most bombers of the period. Visibility was good and the aircraft was almost a three-engine fighter. This slimness reduced drag but also somewhat worsened {{the task of the}} two pilots. Both pilots' seats were offset to port to allow a passageway for the bombardier to enter his compartment below the pilot's feet (directly behind the central engine), by ducking through an opening under the starboard instrument panel. Both front and rear instrument panels contained flight and navigation instruments, while the <b>engine</b> <b>monitoring</b> gauges were located to starboard where the rear pilot could see them past the front pilot's shoulder (cockpit picture showing instruments and bombardier's access way). Although the rear pilot's view was limited, he was capable of landing or taking off if needed; however his primary purpose was to allow the pilot to rest, and to add some [...] "muscle" [...] to the controls when needed, as well as acting as an extra set of eyes to notice problems and to monitor gauges while the other is occupied. There were five crewmembers; the pilot, the copilot, a bombardier/navigator/ventral gunner, a dorsal gunner/radio operator, and waist gunner/flight engineer. The radio equipment was located in the center section between the dorsal turret and the waist position. Like most trimotor Italian aircraft of the period the Z.1007 suffered from poor defensive armament, although it was no worse than many other contemporary designs, many of which had no rotating dorsal turret, no waist guns, or no ventral gun, or various combinations of such. Other issues were poor engine reliability and a weak power-to-weight ratio due to low powered engines (the three 1,000 hp engines of the Z.1007bis were equivalent to twin engines of 1,500 hp each, but this was slightly offset by the added weight of the third engine). The Z.1007 also suffered longitudinal stability problems that were partly rectified later by the adoption of a twin tail arrangement. The Z.1007's wooden structure suffered cracks, separations and surface delamination due to the difficult climatic conditions in North Africa and Russia, but on the contrary allowed the plane to float in case of ditching. The surface delamination and deformation greatly added to the aircraft drag. A total of 660 Alciones were built.|$|E
