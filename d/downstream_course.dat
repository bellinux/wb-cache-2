50|$|The Teays River {{was a major}} preglacial {{river that}} drained much of the present Ohio River watershed, but took a more northerly <b>downstream</b> <b>course.</b> Traces of the Teays across {{northern}} Ohio and Indiana are represented by a network of river valleys. The largest still existing contributor to the former Teays River is the Kanawha River in West Virginia, which is itself {{an extension of the}} New River.The name Teays from the Teays Valley is associated with this buried valley since 1910. The more appropriate name would be ancestral Kanawha Valley. The term Teays is used when discussing the buried portion of the ancestral Kanawha River.The Teays was comparable in size to the Ohio River. The River's headwaters were located near Blowing Rock, North Carolina and subsequently flowed through Virginia, West Virginia, Ohio, Indiana and Illinois. (Hansen, 1995). The largest tributary to the Teays River was the Old Kentucky River (Teller 1991), which extended from southern Kentucky through Frankfort and subsequently flowed northeast, meeting other tributaries and eventually joining the Teays.|$|E
50|$|Following damages {{incurred}} by the dam itself during the 1952 Kern County earthquake and growing concerns over its structural integrity, the reservoir was drained in 1966. Since the early 1970s, efforts {{had been made}} to refill the reservoir but these plans have since been abandoned due to high costs. In the decades that followed, the suburban communities of Santa Clarita had grown northward to fill the narrow valley just <b>downstream.</b> The <b>course</b> of Dry Canyon Creek south of the reservoir was then funneled down a concrete wash to prevent flooding of the surrounding communities.|$|R

50|$|In 1943, {{the second}} wartime Boat Race between the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge {{was held on}} the Thames at Sandford. Like the first, it was {{unofficial}} and no Blues were awarded. However, public enthusiasm was high and the river banks were thronged with spectators, {{all of whom had}} to reach the course either by bicycle or on foot. Contemporary newspaper reports estimate the crowd at between seven and ten thousand. The Cambridge crew, unusually for the time, included a Dane at bow and a Turk at number four. The Oxford crew included four medical students. The race was rowed between the narrow banks of a 1.25 mi <b>downstream</b> <b>course</b> with the start about 0.25 mi below Sandford Lock and the finish at the Radley College Boathouse. Oxford won the toss and chose the Oxfordshire bank, with Cambridge rowing on the Berkshire side. Oxford set off at 40 strokes compared to Cambridge's 37, and were almost immediately in the lead and a length up in some thirty seconds. Despite being left at the start, Cambridge did not give up and responded well, with the judge’s verdict at the finish recorded as a win for Oxford by just two-thirds of a length.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{present study}} {{involves}} physico-chemical analysis of water samples collected monthly from three sites near Nangal wetland {{for a period}} of one year. The main purpose of study is to provide baseline data regarding potability and self purification of water along the industrial belt. Hydrobiological parameters include water temperature, colour, turbidity or total suspended solids, total dissolved solids, pH, free CO 2, DO, free ammonia, nitrates, phosphates, sulphates, BOD and population dynamics. The present investigations showed that water was crystal clear with high values of pH and DO at upstream Nangal dam (S 1) while at effluent nallah of NFL (S 2) has high values of BOD, free ammonia, nitrates, sulphates, chlorides, free CO 2, turbidity, TDS, but low values of DO with more alkaline nature of wastewater. This site is mesosaprobic with eutrophic conditions. After confluence with NFL at (S 3) all parameters were slightly beyond desirable limits may be due to self purification capacity of water.

30|$|The closer the {{capacity}} is to one extreme, {{the more likely}} the bottleneck is in the corresponding direction, but the chances of observing the direction become less likely. Hence, a trade-off {{has to be made}} between accuracy and observability. From the authors’ practical experience, a one-third approach worked well. If the buffer is below one-third full, then the bottleneck is probably upstream. If the buffer is above two-thirds full, then the bottleneck is probably downstream. If the buffer is between one-third and two-thirds full, then there is not enough information to assume a bottleneck upstream or <b>downstream.</b> Of <b>course</b> other trade-offs are also possible. Especially in the case of small buffers, the rule of one-third often cannot be followed due to rounding problems.|$|R
40|$|The Brahmaputra River {{is one of}} {{the largest}} rivers in the world as well as in Bangladesh. The present study was carried out for a period of one year from January to December 2013 with a view to {{assessing}} the availability of fishes in the river with species emphasis on species richness, existing threats and conservation issues. Daytime and night sampling were carried out in three sites located along the upstream to <b>downstream</b> <b>course</b> of the river on a monthly basis. Three fishing gears including cast net, seine net and drag net and one fishing trap were employed to collect fishes. A total of 67 finfish species including 63 indigenous and 4 exotic/alien species have been recorded belonging to 46 genera, 24 families and 8 orders. Cypriniformes and Cyprinidae were the most dominating order (21 species) family (15 species) of native fishes. A small portion (2 %) of native fishes was globally threatened. Over one third of total species (38 %) were considered threatened to extinct species in Bangladesh. Population trend of over two third of total fish species was Declining in the river. Major threats were alien/invasive species, banned fishing gears and loss of habitats...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} recent anthropogenic-induced climate change, a burning {{question}} at present is how these changes influence the water regime of rivers, which are of vital importance for humans {{as well as}} for biota. In this study, we investigate the changes in the hydrologic regime of two major German rivers, Elbe and Rhine, after the middle of the 20 th century. Here, we use the widely adopted Range of Variability Approach (RVA) method on daily streamflow data from five (Elbe) and seven (Rhine) hydrological stations to determine the variability and spatial pattern of hydrologic alterations. We discuss the potential effect of climate change on the water regime of these two rivers, as well as other potential causes. For both rivers, we find that some hydrologic parameters are highly altered, especially the number of reversals, indicating higher variability. The highest impact is found at Ems hydrological station on Rhine River. The order of affected hydrological stations follows mostly the <b>downstream</b> <b>course</b> of both rivers. Our study indicates that the hydrological behavior of Elbe and Rhine Rivers has altered since the middle of the 20 th century, a probable consequence of climate change. These hydrologic alterations can lead to undesirable ecological effects on local biota...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} ten years, {{engineering}} classrooms have seen an exponential growth {{in the use of}} technology, more than during any other previous decade. Unprecedented advancements, such as the advent of innovative gadgets and fundamental instructional alterations in engineering classrooms, have introduced changes in both teaching and learning. Student learning in introductory, fundamental engineering mechanics (IFEM) courses, such as statics of engineering, mechanics of materials, dynamics, and mechanics of fluids, as in any other class, is influenced by the experiences students go through in the classroom. Thus, bold new methodologies that connect science to life using student-centered approaches and scaffolding pedagogies need to be emphasized more in the learning process. This study is aimed to gain insight into the role of student-centered teaching, particularly the implementation of scaffolding pedagogies into IFEM courses. This study also attempts to contribute to the current national conversation in engineering education of the need to change its landscape—from passive learning to active learning. Demographic characteristics in this study included a total of 3, 592 students, of whom 3, 160 (88. 0 %) are males and 432 (12. 0 %) are females, over a period of six years, from 2007 to 2013. The students’ majors included aerospace engineering, agricultural engineering, civil engineering, construction engineering, industrial engineering, materials engineering, and mechanical engineering. Results of the study, as tested using a general linear univariate model analysis, indicated that overwhelmingly the type of class in statics of engineering is a significant predictor of student “downstream” performance in tests measuring their knowledge of mechanics of materials. There is a statistically significant difference in students’ performance in mechanics of materials depending on whether they were taught passively using the teacher-centered pedagogy or taught actively using the student-centered pedagogy in statics of engineering. Mechanics of materials is commonly the next immediate course, or a <b>downstream</b> <b>course,</b> following statics of engineering...|$|E
