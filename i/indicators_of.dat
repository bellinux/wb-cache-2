5|$|Brachiopod fossils {{have been}} useful <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> climate changes during the Paleozoic era. When global {{temperatures}} were low, {{as in much}} of the Ordovician, the large difference in temperature between equator and poles created different collections of fossils at different latitudes. On the other hand, warmer periods, such much of the Silurian, created smaller difference in temperatures, and all seas at the low to middle latitudes were colonized by the same few brachiopod species.|$|E

5|$|Fishermen have {{traditionally}} used seabirds as <b>indicators</b> <b>of</b> both fish shoals, underwater banks that might indicate fish stocks, and of potential landfall.
