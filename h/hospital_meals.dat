40|$|Background: Malnutrition is {{prevalent}} among patients hospitalized in Intensive Care Units (ICUs) and causes various complications. Dietary supplementation to provide appropriate nutritional support {{may reduce the}} malnutrition and complications through improvement in nutritional status. This study was carried out to assess the association between dietary supplementation and malnutrition among patients in ICUs. Methods: A case-control study was conducted on 180 male patients aged 20 - 60 years in the ICUs of the hospitals in Ahvaz, Iran in 2013. Data of two groups including 83 patients (cases) who had consumed regular <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> and dietary supplements and 97 patients (controls) who had received regular <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> were compared. Anthropometric measurements, laboratory values, and dietary intakes were extracted from medical records, and Maastricht index (MI) was calculated. Data were analyzed using the IBM SPSS Statistics 21. T-test and paired-sample t-test {{were used to determine}} the difference between groups. Results: Taking supplements increased daily energy intake, carbohydrate, and protein in case group (n = 83) significantly (P < 0. 05). MI changed to 3. 1 ± 3. 8 and 4. 3 ± 4. 2 in case (n = 83) and control (n = 97) groups, respectively. Although the MI fell in both groups, it showed a greater reduction in case group (from 6. 3 ± 5. 3 to 3. 1 ± 3. 8). Conclusions: Since consuming dietary supplements besides the regular <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> increased intake of energy and macronutrients and reduced the MI significantly, it was concluded that it helped supply nutritional requirements more effectively and improved the malnutrition in ICU...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis {{is to examine the}} field of {{research}} with relevance to the topic geriatric malnutrition in order to propose recommendations that can stimulate the appetite, increase food intake, and stabilize the nutritional status of the geriatric patient at risk of malnutrition. For this purpose searches were conducted in the bibliographical databases: PubMed, PsycINFO and Sociological Abstracts along with various other resources. Based on these searches an analysis of the data was initiated in order to retrieve contents and results with relevance to the field of interest. The frame of this analysis consisted of three categories defined as: multisensory, psychosocial, and situational/practical. The theoretical foundation of the two main categories was based on the works of Lotte Holm in regards to the psychosocial area of research, and Charles Spence, Betina Piqueras-Fiszman and Gordon Shepherd regarding the multisensory area. Several causes of action to alleviate the problem of malnutrition have been identified as decisive through this analysis, which has lead to the conclusion of the master thesis. The conclusion includes recommendations for multicomponent cross-disciplinary interventions with focus on upgrading the multisensory, culinary, and psychosocial qualities of the <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> and dining environments. Furthermore, programmes like “protected mealtimes” and “Red tray” should be included along with enhanced monitoring, registration and gastro-profiling of the at-risk-geriatric-patient’s eating behaviours. Finally, a successful intervention to combat geriatric malnutrition must include increased attention from key political players and health professionals as part of a paradigmatic and political shift that will ensure that the <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> are recognized as {{a vital part of the}} overall treatment, and that geriatric malnutrition will receive the funding necessary to ensure this shift in the policies and practices of the <b>hospital</b> <b>meals...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{prevalence}} of disease-related malnutrition in hospital inpatients is high; many patients {{do not meet}} individual nutrition requirements while hospitalized. To better understand the reasons for inadequate nutrition intake, this study describes patient satisfaction, food provision, food intake, and waste of <b>hospital</b> <b>meals.</b> Methods: Over 6 days, 150 <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> were weighed and nutrient composition was calculated. On return from the wards, waste was weighed. In addition, nutrition intake was compared to nutrition requirements in 42 patients. In a separate study, the authors studied patient satisfaction with the hospital food service using interviews (n = 112). Results: The 3 main meals accounted for a mean of 1809 ± 143 kcal and 76 ± 13 g of protein per day. In total, 38 % of the food provided by the kitchen was wasted. As a consequence, the main meals supplied an average of 1105 ± 594 kcal and 47 ± 27 g of protein to patients. Sixty-one percent of patients had an energy intake < 90 % and 75 % had a protein intake < 90 % of requirements. Most patients were satisfied or fairly satisfied with the choices, taste, and presentation of the main meals. Satisfaction with snack meals and information was inadequate. Conclusions: The standard meals provided by the hospital kitchen provide adequate amounts of energy and protein. However, most patients do not consume complete meals. It may be concluded that food waste is largely attributed to the inadequate intake of many hospitalized patients. Patients who experienced the worst health status ate the least. © 2012 American Society for Parenteral and Enteral Nutrition...|$|E

Forty infant and child aged 6 to 36 months suffer from pneumonia and admitted Bab El-Shaareya Hospital for treatment were selected for this study. The children divided into four equal groups; control group (CG), beta carotene group (BCG), lycopene group (LYG) and mixture (lycopene+beta-carotene) group (MG). All subjects were received <b>hospital</b> <b>meal</b> without any modification, while BCG received 15 mg/day of beta carotene; LYG received 15 mg/day of lycopene and MG received 7. 5 mg/day lycopene + 7. 5 mg/day beta carotene. All groups received <b>hospital</b> <b>meal</b> in addition to tested carotenoid that dissolved in orange juice. The intervention period continued for 14 consecutive days. The respiratory rate (RR) and temperature were measured daily till recovery. Also, WBCs, IgE and IgG were determined at admission and after intervention period. Results showed that RR of MG and LYG groups returned normal after 21. 6 ± 7. 2 and 26. 4 ± 10. 4 hours respectively at P< 0. 05, while CG recovered after 37. 2 ± 13. 6 hours. Moreover, administration of lycopene decreased RR significantly (P< 0. 05) by 37. 6 %, while administration of beta carotene or the mixture resulted in decrement of RR by 33. 4 % and 28. 4 % respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the proximal composition, as well as Total Antioxidant Capacity (TAC) and Total Phenols (TPH) in meals that represent a complex food matrix, from different hospitals in Bolivia and Sweden. Protein, fat, ash, dietary fiber and carbohydrate contents were measured in 29 samples: 20 from two Bolivian hospitals and 9 from the university hospital in Lund, Sweden. The antioxidant capacity was measured by three spectrophotometric methods: the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP) method, the 2, 2 '- azinobis- 3 -ethylbenzotiazoline- 6 -sulfonic acid (ABTS) method and Total Phenolic Compounds (TPH) using the Folin-Ciocalteu reagent. The results show that fat, protein, carbohydrate and dietary fiber in Bolivian and Swedish <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> are following internationally established recommendations. Regarding the main courses, TPH contents in both countries were in the same range. However, TAC and dietary fiber content were higher in Swedish meals than in Bolivian meals and the TAC was far lower, in both cases, in comparison with the value obtained from individual food items reported from literature. The results show that antioxidant levels can be easily overestimated by considering only individual uncooked ingredients. An interesting consideration is, the fiber content in the meals, which can be an important source of antioxidants and non-extractable phenolic compounds.

40|$|There are {{potential}} nutritional and sensory benefits of adding sauces to <b>hospital</b> <b>meals.</b> The {{aim of this}} study was to develop nutrient fortified sauces with acceptable sensory properties suitable for older people at risk of under-nutrition. Tomato, gravy and white sauce were fortified with macro and micro-nutrients using food ingredients rich in energy and protein as well as vitamin and mineral premixes. Sensory profile was assessed by a trained panel. Hedonic liking of fortified compared with standard sauces was evaluated by healthy older volunteers. The fortified sauces had higher nutritional value than the conventional ones, for example the energy content of the fortified tomato, white sauce and gravy formulations were increased between 2. 5 and 4 fold compared to their control formulations. Healthy older consumers preferred the fortified tomato sauce compared with unfortified. There were no significant differences in liking between the fortified and standard option for gravy. There were limitations in the extent of fortification with protein, potassium and magnesium, as excessive inclusion resulted in bitterness, undesired flavours or textural issues. This was particularly marked in the white sauce to the extent that their sensory characteristics were not sufficiently optimised for hedonic testing. It is proposed that the development of fortified sauces is a simple approach to improving energy intake for hospitalised older people, both through the nutrient composition of the sauce itself and due to the benefits of increasing sensorial taste and lubrication in the mouth...|$|E

Methods In a cross-sectional study, diabetes in-patient specialist nurses at 58 UK hospitals asked insulin-treated in-patients with diabetes to complete the recently updated Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for In-patients and a general questionnaire; 1319 in-patients completed these questionnaires. Results Satisfaction with the general diabetes treatment items in the Diabetes Treatment Satisfaction Questionnaire for In-patients was high, but there were high levels of extreme dissatisfaction with meal choices, meal quality and lack of similarity of <b>hospital</b> <b>meals</b> to normal domestic choices— 23 % would never or rarely have made similar meal choices at home. Hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia was reported for much of the in-patient stay (20 % and 7 %, respectively) and 26 % reported at least one severe hypoglycaemic episode; these groups had lower satisfaction with the timing of medication in relation to meals (P < 0. 003). More frequent in-patient hyperglycaemia or hypoglycaemia were associated with significantly poorer overall satisfaction scores and negative well-being scores (both P < 0. 0001). Previous experience of a multiple daily insulin injection regimen was associated with more dissatisfaction than other regimens (P < 0. 01). Multiple regression models explained 36 % of variability in overall treatment satisfaction, with most (22. 4 %) accounted for by satisfaction with time spent with a diabetes in-patient specialist nurse (P < 0. 0001).

Her original plan was to become a chemistry teacher but then decided to study Dietetics at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh, under Sister Ruth Pybus, a pioneer in the science of nutrition. She qualified in 1939. When the Second World War started, she worked for two years as a dietician at the Royal Northern <b>Hospital</b> providing <b>meals</b> to patients and running the hospital's dietetics department.|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Basal insulin dose {{requirements}} {{in patients with}} type 1 diabetes may be derived from the course of glucose concentrations in the fasting state; i. e. by skipping meals. The present study examined whether fasting tests could be replaced by carbohydrate-free meals. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 16 adult patients with type 1 diabetes (10 male) on intensive insulin therapy participated in this prospective intervention study. Mean age (+/-SD) was 44 +/- 12 years, BMI 24 +/- 3 kg/m (2), mean HbA 1 c was 7. 5 +/- 0. 6 % and duration of diabetes 15 +/- 12 years. All participants skipped dinner and plasma glucose concentrations were hourly monitored from 7 p. m. to 11 p. m. This blood glucose profile was compared with three test meals given at 7 p. m. at day 2 - 4, consumed either in the <b>hospital</b> (<b>meal</b> 1) or at home (meal 2 and 3). No insulin injection (except to basal insulin) was allowed. Test meals consisted of 2. 5 g carbohydrate, 32. 4 g protein, 52. 0 g fat (according to 612 kcal). RESULTS: During 16 fasting tests plasma glucose concentration remained stable between 7. 2 +/- 2. 4 mmol/l at 7 p. m. and 6. 8 +/- 2. 8 mmol/l at 11 p. m. (p= 0. 461). Following the intake of near carbohydrate-free meals (48 tests), plasma glucose concentrations rose within 4 h from 6. 7 +/- 2. 0 at 7 p. m. to 9. 8 +/- 3. 4 mmol/l at 11 p. m. (p< 0. 0001). The increase in plasma glucose concentrations was similar in all three different meals tested. CONCLUSION: Plasma glucose concentrations significantly increase in patients with type 1 diabetes following the intake of carbohydrate-free meals. Carbohydrate-free meal-tests cannot replace skipping meal tests to determine the basal insulin requirement in patients with type 1 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Nutrition plays a {{major role}} in {{protecting}} health and slowing disease progression. Hospital diets play an indispensable role in patient recovery and well-being. But providing appropriate nutrition in the <b>hospital</b> <b>meal</b> is a particularly challenging task because of the diverse dietary needs of the patients. The proposed study was done with the objective to assess the satisfaction of the patients towards the diet and overall acceptability of the hospital diet being served to the patients. The study was conducted in one government hospital in Chandigarh city. Sixty self structured questionnaires based on four types of diets viz. regular, diabetic, low protein-low sodium and high protein diets were filled with the cooperation of patients after seeking due permission from hospital authorities. Questionnaires were tabulated and analyzed using SPSS 12. The sensory evaluation was done by using 5 -point Hedonic Scale. From the data, it was deduced that 56. 67 per cent of the patients were satisfied from the quantity given whereas only few patients (26. 67 %) were satisfied with the desired consistency of diets. After analyzing sensory aspects of the diets, it was found that the mean of freshness, taste, appearance and aroma were 2. 93 ± 0. 841, 2. 55 ± 0. 946, 2. 68 ± 1. 016 and 2. 48 ± 0. 873 respectively. The mean of overall acceptability of the served diets was 2. 66 ± 0. 932. The findings of the study show that almost all the patients were satisfied with the type of diets they were getting, amount of the feed and time taken for the delivery of the meal. The major issue for the dissatisfaction among patients were monotonous, repetitive and insipid food which requires serious and determined attempts of dietetics and Food Service Department...|$|R
