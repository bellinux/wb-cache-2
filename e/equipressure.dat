40|$|Received????; accepted???? We {{construct}} {{a new family}} of analytic models of black hole accretion disks in dynamical equilibria. Our construction is based on assuming distributions of angular momentum and entropy. For a particular choice {{of the distribution of}} angular momentum, we calculate the shapes of <b>equipressure</b> surfaces. The <b>equipressure</b> surfaces we find are similar to those in thick, slim and thin disks, and to those in ADAFs. Key words. black holes – accretion disks – analytic models 1...|$|E
40|$|A {{solution}} of Einstein's equations for {{the interior of}} a rigidly rotating axisymmetric perfect fluid is presented, with an equation of state mu + 3 p = 0. The <b>equipressure</b> surfaces are closed. The solution has a static limit. The metric functions of the line element of the solution, in the usual coordinates, are expressed in terms of the Weierstrass elliptic function...|$|E
40|$|The {{problem of}} finding a class of {{solutions}} of Einstein's field equations for {{the interior of a}} uniformly rotating, axisymmetric perfect fluid is reduced to the integration of a known function. A number of solutions of the class is given explicitly. The <b>equipressure</b> surfaces of all solutions of the class are planes. The class contains solutions with the equation of state p = γμ, γ> 0, 0 >γ≥ - 1 + 2 /√ 5, and γ≤ - 1 - 2 /√ 5, which are given explicitly. © 1987 American Institute of Physics...|$|E
40|$|A general {{class of}} {{solutions}} of Einstein's equations for {{the interior of}} a rigidly rotating axisymmetric perfect fluid is presented, which depends on an arbitrary function. To get solutions explicitly one has to calculate two integrals involving the arbitrary function. The <b>equipressure</b> surfaces of all solutions of the class are spheres or planes. A family of solutions, which depend on four arbitrary real constants, is calculated explicitly. The solution of the family, which is obtained if we assign a specific value to one of its parameters, and which was found before, is futher generalized with the addition of one more parameter. © 1988 Plenum Publishing Corporation...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIt is {{significant}} to identify urban active faults {{for human life}} and social sustainable development. The ordinary methods to detect active faults, such as geological survey, artificial seismic exploration, and electromagnetic exploration, are not convenient {{to be carried out}} in urban area with dense buildings. It is also difficult to supply information about vertical extension of the deeper faults by these methods. Gravity, reflecting the mass distribution of the Earth's interior, provides an alternative way to detect faults, which is more efficient and convenient for urban active fault detection than the aforementioned techniques. Based on the multi-scale decomposition of gravity anomalies, a novel method to invert multilayer horizontal tectonic stresses is proposed. The inverted multilayer stress fields are further used to infer the distribution and stability of the main faults. In order to validate our method, the multilayer stress fields in the Shenzhen fault zone are calculated as a case study. The calculated stress fields show that their distribution is controlled significantly by the strike of the main faults and can be used to derive depths of the faults. The main faults in Shenzhen may range from 4 km to 20 km in the depth. Each layer of the crust is nearly <b>equipressure</b> since the horizontal tectonic stress has small amplitude. It indicates that the main faults in Shenzhen are relatively stable and have no serious impact on planning and construction of the city...|$|E
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{mathematical model}} of the respiratory system is developed using available physiological data and structural information. The model evolves through systemic analysis and development of causal relationships describing the three main subsystems; neural control, lung mechanics and gas exchange. The subsystem models are based upon physiological evidence where possible but limited experimental data necessitates some structural hypothesisation particularly in the neural control model where knowledge concerning the central respiratory centre is scant and vague. Investigation of the neural system employs the concept of maintained respiratory rhythmicity through two coupled oscillators. Software and hardware models are generated and implemented and comparative testing gives {{a better understanding of}} the system behaviour. An improved model of the lung mechanics system is developed incorporating the concept of the <b>equipressure</b> point and a new theoretical approach to aid analysis. Performance of new experiments on humans allows further validation of a suitably adapted, existing gas exchange model. Detailed analysis and validation of the individual subsystem models using appropriate performance criteria, and their subsequent combination through the design of physiologically acceptable interfaces leads to the overall model of the respiratory system. Model uniqueness may be revealed through validation processes and the applicability of two approaches to structural identification and parameter estimation to the models of the respiratory system is demonstrated. A combination of the two techniques (functional minimisation and feature space pattern recognition) in conjunction with sensitivity analysis and model reduction is proposed as a superior means of identification of physiological systems. The comprehensive model of the respiratory system and the subsystem models highlight areas of uncertainty, providing, stimulation for future research in physiological and modelling fields,' Suggestions for further experimentation and theoretical studies in relevant areas are presented...|$|E
