5|$|On Thursday, 21 October 1948, Boeing {{engineers}} George S. Schairer, Art Carlsen and Vaughn Blumenthal {{presented the}} design of a <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> bomber to the chief of bomber development, Colonel Pete Warden. Warden was disappointed by the projected aircraft and asked if the Boeing team could come up with a proposal for a four-engine turbojet bomber. Joined by Ed Wells, Boeing vice president of engineering, the engineers worked that night in the Hotel Van Cleve in Dayton, Ohio, redesigning Boeing's proposal as a four-engine turbojet bomber. On Friday, Colonel Warden looked over the information and asked for a better design. Returning to the hotel, the Boeing team was joined by Bob Withington and Maynard Pennell, two top Boeing engineers who were in town on other business.|$|E
5|$|In situ measurements, in real-time, can {{be taken}} by sending {{specially}} equipped reconnaissance flights into the cyclone. In the Atlantic basin, these flights are regularly flown by United States government hurricane hunters. The aircraft used are WC-130 Hercules and WP-3D Orions, both <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> cargo aircraft. These aircraft fly directly into the cyclone and take direct and remote-sensing measurements. The aircraft also launch GPS dropsondes inside the cyclone. These sondes measure temperature, humidity, pressure, and especially winds between flight level and the ocean's surface. A new era in hurricane observation began when a remotely piloted Aerosonde, a small drone aircraft, was flown through Tropical Storm Ophelia as it passed Virginia's Eastern Shore during the 2005 hurricane season. A similar mission was also completed successfully in the western Pacific Ocean. This demonstrated {{a new way to}} probe the storms at low altitudes that human pilots seldom dare.|$|E
5|$|LANSA Flight 502 was a Lockheed L-188A Electra {{operated}} by Líneas Aéreas Nacionales Sociedad Anónima (LANSA) which crashed shortly after takeoff from Quispiquilla Airport near Cusco, Peru, on August 9, 1970, after losing all power {{from one of}} its engines. The <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> aircraft, registered OB-R-939, was bound from Cusco to Lima, carrying 8 crew and 92 passengers. All {{but one of the}} occupants died from injuries sustained from impact forces and post crash fire. Two people on the ground were also killed. There were 49 American high school exchange students on board, all of whom perished. A Peruvian government investigation concluded that the accident was caused by improper execution of engine-out procedures by the flight crew, aggravated by lack of maintenance and overloading. LANSA was fined and its operations were suspended for 90 days. At the time, the crash was the deadliest ever in Peruvian history.|$|E
50|$|In 1963, Continental was {{operating}} British-manufactured Vickers Viscount <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprops</b> {{on a daily}} round trip routing of Houston Hobby Airport - Austin - San Angelo - Midland/Odessa - El Paso - Tucson - Phoenix - Los Angeles as well as flying Viscount propjet service direct to Lubbock and Amarillo. By 1964, Continental had ceased serving Austin; however, by 1970 the airline was once again operating flights into Mueller.|$|R
50|$|Every {{hurricane}} season, HRD {{carries out}} an annual field program during which it collects information on tropical cyclones (especially Atlantic hurricanes) {{in order to}} improve scientific understanding of their formation, structure, and dynamics. Data is collected from satellites, land-based radar, wind towers, and from aircraft. They archive flight information from Air Force Reserve Hurricane Hunters, and plan and participate in research flights on NOAA's Aircraft Operations Center planes. The present fleet consists of two Orion P-3 <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprops,</b> which can fly directly into the eye of hurricanes, and a Gulfstream IV high-altitude jet, which is used to fly around tropical cyclones, dropping instrument packages called dropsondes.|$|R
50|$|With the U.S. {{breaking}} relations (in January 1961) and {{the imposition}} of a total U.S. embargo on Cuba on 7 February 1962 (beyond the partial one imposed in October 1960), Cubana turned to the Soviet Union to obtain new aircraft. Although the Bristol Britannias were kept in service for many years, the airline's Viscounts (VV-755) and Super Viscounts (VV-818) were sold in 1961 and 1962 to other carriers (Cunard Eagle, Trans-Australia, and South African Airways). The first Soviet-built aircraft type delivered was the twin-engine, piston-prop Ilyushin IL-14 in late 1961. Soon after, Ilyushin IL-18 <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprops</b> were delivered, and began to be used in Cubana's domestic services. They were followed by the twin-engine Antonov AN-24 and AN-26, and the four-engine AN-12, all of them turboprops. The AN-26s and AN-12s, both freighters, helped sustain and expand Cubana's cargo operations on short- and long-range routes. These aircraft replaced all of Cubana's Viscounts, Super Viscounts and U.S.-built aircraft. Except for the Bristol Britannias, Cubana's fleet would now be made up of Soviet-built aircraft.|$|R
25|$|The Breguet 941 was a French <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> STOL {{transport}} aircraft developed by Breguet in the 1960s. Although widely evaluated, {{it was not}} built in large numbers, with only one prototype and four production aircraft being built.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in September 1959, KLM {{introduced}} the <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> Lockheed Electra onto {{some of its}} European and Middle Eastern routes. In March 1960, the airline {{introduced the}} first Douglas DC-8 jet into its fleet. In 1961, KLM reported its first year of losses. In 1961, the airline's president Fons Aler was succeeded by Ernst van der Beugel. This change of leadership, however, {{did not lead to}} a reversion of KLM's financial difficulties. Van der Beugel resigned as president in 1963 due to health reasons. Horatius Albarda was appointed to succeed Ernst van der Beugel as president of KLM in 1963. Alberda initiated a reorganization of the company, which led to the reduction of staff and air services. In 1965, Alberda died in an air crash and was succeeded as president by Dr. Gerrit van der Wal. Van der Wal forged an agreement with the Dutch government that KLM would be once again run as a private company. By 1966, the stake of the Dutch government in KLM was reduced to a minority stake of 49.5%. In 1966, KLM introduced the Douglas DC-9 on European and Middle East routes.|$|E

5000|$|In 1975, the 144th gaining command {{was changed}} from the Alaskan Air Command (AAC) to the Military Airlift Command (MAC) {{as part of the}} [...] "Total Force" [...] concept. After 16 years {{operating}} C-123’s, the squadron converted to the C-130E Hercules aircraft. The first of eight <b>four-engine</b> Vietnam veteran <b>turboprops</b> was received in early 1976, and the 144th became equipped for a truly global mission. Their range, speed, and airlift capabilities were more than double those of the C-123’s they replaced.|$|R
500|$|At about 2:55 pm, the <b>four-engine</b> Electra <b>turboprop</b> {{began its}} takeoff {{run to the}} west. At {{some point during the}} takeoff run or initial climb, the number three engine failed and caught fire. The crew {{continued}} the takeoff and climb, per standard procedure, using power from the remaining three engines. The pilot radioed the control tower declaring an emergency, and the control tower cleared the flight for an immediate landing. The number three engine was engulfed in flames as the crew retracted the flaps and maneuvered the plane into a left turn back to the runway. The plane entered a 30–45 degree bank, then rapidly lost altitude and crashed into hilly terrain about [...] west-southwest of the runway, above the village of San Jerónimo. [...] The fuel on board caught fire and all aboard perished except the copilot, 26 year old Juan Loo, who was found in the wreckage of the cockpit badly burned but alive.

40|$|Abstract—Renewed {{interest}} in propeller propulsion on aircraft configurations combined with higher propeller loads {{lead to the}} question how {{the effects of the}} propulsion on model support disturbances should be accounted for. In this paper, the determination of engine power effects on support interference of sting-mounted models is demonstrated by a measurement on a <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> aircraft. CFD results on a more generic model are presented in order to clarify the possible mechanism behind engine power effects on support interference. The engine slipstream induces a local change in angle of sideslip at the model sting thereby influencing the sting near-field and far-field effects. Whether or not the net result of these changes in the disturbance pattern leads to a significant engine power effect depends on the configuration of the wind tunnel model and the test setup.

40|$|A {{flexibly}} mounted {{aircraft engine}} may {{under certain conditions}} experience a self-excited whirling instability involving a coupling between the gyroscopic and aerodynamic forces acting on the propeller, and the inertial, elastic, and damping forces contributed by the power plant, nacelle, and wing. This phenomenon has been called autoprecession, or whirl instability. An experimental investigation {{was made in the}} Langley transonic dynamics tunnel at Mach numbers below 0. 3 to study some of the pertinent parameters influencing the phenomenon. These parameters included propeller rotational speed, stiffness of the power-plant assembly in the pitch and yaw planes and the ratio of pitch stiffness to yaw stiffness, structural damping of the power-plant assembly in the pitch and yaw planes, simulated fuel load in the wings, and the location and number of autoprecessing powerplant assemblies. A large dynamic-aeroelastic model of a <b>four-engine</b> <b>turboprop</b> transport airplane mounted on a vertical rod in a manner which provided several limited body degrees of freedom was used in the investigation. It was found that the boundary for autoprecession decreased markedly with Increasing proreduction of power-plant stiffness and/or damping, and to a lesser degree decreased with reduction of simulated fuel load in the wings. peller rotational speed generally lowered the autoprecession boundary. This effect was more pronounced as the stiffness was increased. An inboard power plant was found to be more susceptible to autoprecession than an outboard one. Combinations in which two or more power plants had the same level of reduced stiffness resulted in autoprecession boundaries considerably lower than that of a single power plant with the same level of reduced stiffness...|$|E
