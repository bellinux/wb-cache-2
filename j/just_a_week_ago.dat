The event placed geology right in the centre of the debate about what shale gas might mean for Britain. Suddenly geology really mattered to the ordinary man in the street. The question in many minds was: is there enough of this gas to make a difference to Britain? Or are we making a big fuss about nothing? Previous gas company resource or ‘gas-in-place’ estimates had been on the large side, but other institutions (for example the American Energy Information Administration, EIA) put the figures lower. Some large oil and gas companies had basically written Britain off as a shale gas player. Environmentalists and industrialists alike complained: how could the figures vary so much? Confusion reigned.

For the Kindergarten the exercise was held early in the school year so as to train those who are new to the establishment. The evacuation was a complete success and all went as it was supposed to. When the children and teachers smelt smoke they followed the prescribed evacuation routes and left the building immediately. Once outside the situation was revealed as an exercise and everyone went back to business as usual, everyone that is, except the fire brigade and fire inspector.

40|$|With LHC {{commissioned}} <b>just</b> <b>a</b> few <b>weeks</b> <b>ago,</b> {{all sorts}} of ideas about physics beyond the standard model are being explored. A strong-coupling chiral theory appearing at TeV scale remains a possibility but also a very hard scenario to study. When it comes to strongly coupled theories, lattice regularization {{is by far the}} most reliable method. But defining exact chiral gauge theory on the lattice remains a difficult problem on its own. We show that the idea to use additional non-gauge, high-scale mirror-sector dynamics to decouple the mirror fermions without breaking the gauge symmetry might lead to a practically manageable solution. We demonstrate, using the exact lattice chirality, that partition functions of lattice gauge theories with vector like fermion representations can be split into "light " and "mirror " parts, each containing a chiral representation. We show that such a splitting is only well defined when both sectors are separately anomaly free. We also prove that, the generating function and therefore the spectrum of an arbitrary chiral gauge theory is a smooth function of the background gauge field, if and only if the anomaly free condition is satisfied. We reached this conclusion by proving some very general properties of an arbitrary chiral gauge theory on lattice, and the results should be of importance for further studies in this field...|$|R
