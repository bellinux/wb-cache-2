In 1961, BBC and Krupp began AVR construction, led by Rudolf Schulten, performed on almost purely industrial basis until 1964. The federal government provided financial assistance, supported by the politician {{and founder of the}} Juelich Research Center (JRC), Leo Brandt.In 1964, Schulten became Director of the JRC and started to devote more attention to the pebble bed reactor. In 1966, AVR first achieved criticality, and was connected to the national power grid in 1967. Construction cost figures vary between 85 and 125 million Deutsche marks ($2.5 - $3.7bn in 2014).Since about 1970 the AVR GmbH was de facto dependent on JRC, although it remained formally independent until 2003. JRC provided generous operating grants to the AVR GmbH to ensure continued operation, since electricity generation only covered {{a small part of the}} operating costs. In the mid-1970s annual revenue was about 3 million DM, versus operating and <b>fuel</b> <b>disposal</b> costs of 11 million DM. JRC also subsidized AVR through procurement and disposal of fuel as JRC has been owner of AVR fuel. In addition, the AVR operation was scientifically supervised by JRC.|$|E

The disposal containers also limit the introduction of moderator into the disposal container during the criticality control period, resist corrosion in the expected repository environment, and provide complete or limited containment of waste {{in the event of}} an accident. Multiple disposal container designs may be needed to accommodate the expected range of DOE Spent Nuclear Fuel. The disposal container will include outer and inner barrier walls and outer and inner barrier lids. Exterior labels will identify the disposal container and contents.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} and {{evaluates the}} data and results currently available on the storage of spent AVR fuel elements. Water basin and dry storage facilities {{as well as the}} extensive experimental and development work are taken into consideration. Only slight quantities of krypton 85 and tritium can be released from the fuel element. These isotopes are produced due to the uranium contamination of the graphite matrix resulting from manufacture. The first barrier is the coating of the nuclear fuel particles which retains practically all the fission products. The second barrier required for long-time storage is the welded fuel element can. Unlike existing casks in the FRG made of nodular graphite cast iron, a new AVR cask has been developed which is formed of mild steel R St 37 - 2 and a special heavy concrete. The cask does not have a leak-tightness function but rather only the function of shielding an mechanical protecting the two cans. It possesses the test and quality features of the type B(U) shipping cask pursuant to the IAEA Guidelines. The manufacturing costs are low so that a storage of 15 years involves costs to the amount of 35 DM/fuel element. A comparison of the AVR cask with the spent <b>fuel</b> <b>disposal</b> container for LWR-fuel element shows that it can be used for the direct disposal of spent AVR fuel elements.

40|$|The DOE {{inventory}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} consists of approximately 2700 tonnes heavy metal (MTHM), containing over 100 different fuel types. The current plan for the disposition of this fuel is to condition it for dry storage until it can {{be placed in a}} geological repository. However, the variation in the physical condition and chemical composition of DOE spent fuel complicates the task of qualifying the <b>fuel</b> for repository <b>disposal.</b> Each type or category of fuel must be characterized and certified to meet repository disposal criteria, an expensive and time-consuming process. Some of the fuel types contain chemically reactive components (such as metallic sodium), which must be stabilized prior to long-term storage or disposal. Finally, some of the fuel is damaged or declad, and some has already been altered by its present storage environment, making it difficult to qualify that general type of <b>fuel</b> for <b>disposal.</b> The electrometallurgical (EM) treatment technique developed at Argonne National Laboratory (ANL) has the potential to convert many of these spent fuel types into a uniform set of three product streams (uranium metal, metal waste form, ceramic waste form).

40|$|During {{the last}} decades as a {{consequence}} of mining, metal processing, industrialization, traf-fic, burning of fossil <b>fuels,</b> <b>disposal</b> of wastes, etc., soil and water resources were contaminated with heavy metals (i. e. Pb, Cd, Zn, Cu, Cr, Ni and Hg) all over the world. Most of the physical or physico-chemical remediation methods (i. e. soil flushing, washing, vitrification) to clean the soils degraded with metals not only destroy the physical structure of the soils and stop their biological activity, but also generate secondary pollutants, which needs further handling (Adriano 2001). Phytostabilisation is a new promising strategy to handle polluted soils or mine spoils. During phytostabilisation the pollutants in soils, mine spoils, or industrial by-products are first stabilized with amendments and additives (e. g. liming agents, organic materials, aluminosilicates, phosphates, iron and manganese oxides, coal fly ashes) to reduce their solubility and mobility. Polluted areas are then covered with plants (usually first with grasses, later with bushes and trees) to prevent a contamination of ground-water, air or neighbouring uncontaminated areas (Berti and Cunningham 2000, Mench et al. 2000).
