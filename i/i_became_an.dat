25|$|Mizil was {{mentioned}} in 1529, {{in an official}} document at Brașov. It was first mentioned as Eșteu in 1585, and as Istau in 1591, after its stream. Around {{the turn of the}} 18th century, Prince Constantin Brâncoveanu owned the village, building houses at the nearby Corbeanca Dealul Dumbăvii vineyard and establishing an annual fair in Mizil that would become renowned. It was during the 18th century that a mail coach station for changing horses opened in the village. Merchants began to set up shop, their business augmented by the location between two larger towns; coachmen, wheelwrights, woodcutters and watchmen also found work. In the Ottoman Turkish language of Wallachia's rulers, the station was known as a menzil. The n dropped out through syncope and the <b>i</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> e; given that activity and transactions that took place around it, the resulting name came to be used for the village as a whole and to replace its old name. The first church was built in 1790, and Mizil was declared a town in 1830.|$|E

He produced several compilation books of them, including Ronnie Barker's Book of Bathing Beauties, A Pennyworth of Art, and Sauce. Barker rarely appeared in public, and when he did, it was almost always in character. He once said, [...] "I've always known I haven't a personality of my own, I have {{to be someone else}} to be happy. That's why <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> actor, I suppose." ...|$|E

500|$|In particular, Raymond {{has been}} named as a key {{influence}} {{by many of the}} most influential and important comic book artists of all time. EC Comics-staple Al Williamson cites Raymond as a major influence, and is quoted as saying that Raymond was [...] "the reason <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> artist". Indeed, Williamson ultimately assisted on the Flash Gordon strips in the mid-1950s, and Rip Kirby in the mid-1960s (all post-Raymond). Key Golden Age artists credit Raymond with influencing their work. The artistic creators of Batman (Bob Kane) and Superman (Joe Shuster) credit him (alongside Milton Caniff, Billy DeBeck and Roy Crane) as having had a strong influence on their artistic development. Decades later, the herald of the Silver Age (and co-creator of most of Marvel Comics's pantheon of heroes), Jack [...] "King" [...] Kirby also credits Raymond, alongside fellow strip artist Hal Foster, as a particular influence and inspiration.|$|E
500|$|Author Garry Wills {{believed}} that Davis was generally underrated {{as an actress}} because her constrained part in Hellcats was her most widely seen performance. In addition, Davis downplayed her Hollywood goals: promotional material from MGM in 1949 said that her [...] "greatest ambition" [...] {{was to have a}} [...] "successful happy marriage"; decades later, in 1975, she would say, [...] "I was never really a career woman but [...] only because I hadn't found the man I wanted to marry. I couldn't sit around and do nothing, so <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> actress." [...] Ronald Reagan biographer Lou Cannon nevertheless characterized her as a [...] "reliable" [...] and [...] "solid" [...] performer who held her own in performances with better-known actors. After her final film, Crash Landing (1958), Davis appeared for a brief time as a guest star in television dramas, such as the Zane Grey Theatre episode [...] "The Long Shadow" [...] (1961), where she played opposite Ronald Reagan, as well as Wagon Train and The Tall Man, until she retired as an actress in 1962.|$|E

Smith, John Frusciante, Bruce Dickinson and Julian Cope. Dickinson, {{who has been a}} fan of the band since he saw them at Oundle School aged 13, said that Hammill was one of his childhood heroes. Coxon is particularly fond of [...] "House with No Door" [...] from H to He (1970), saying the track is [...] "extremely beautiful, with Jackson's truly lovely sax-and-flute instrumental section." [...] Almond recalled hearing [...] "Killer" [...] for the first time saying, [...] "I'd never heard anything like it before. It wasn't just Peter's snarling operatic vocal, it was the mix of instruments... <b>I</b> <b>became</b> <b>an</b> instant fan." [...] Mentioning their reputation as something of an acquired taste, Lydon said, [...] "There's a few Van Der Graaf things I like, but I'm not going to recommend anything to anyone. It might not be for them. Music doesn't come with a set of guidelines." ...|$|E

He is a non-Pashto speaking Pashtun and speaks Punjabi as his first language. By age 20, Khan could play the guitar, bass, and drums.
