Army Dear Bryant Service Club:- I {{was most}} happy and {{pleased to have}} {{received}} from you a nice Easter package and a letter of news {{from some of the}} fellows I once knew. It’s been a long time that most of us have left the “Portals of Knowledge” to do our share. Some, as myself, are most fortunate to be still in the States, and others less fortunate to have gone across. But, in our feelings of reserve, we too are anxious to avenge the “dirty” blow on us by our enemies, and we feel it won’t be very long. My buddies of the “Unholy Five” are pretty well scattered. Cpl. Frank Zorra is in England with the Finance Corps. Sgt. Wm. Bento is a gunner in the B- 27 and is across also. Pfc. Bernard Vezina is still stationed at Maxton Field, N. C. Pvt. Mario Rogue, who also was separated from the A. S. T. P. is now in connections with the Medical Corps at Camp Pickett, Va. These are the only ones I know about.

40|$|<b>Hello,</b> I hope <b>everyone</b> {{is having}} a good spring. The monsoons seem to have {{finished}} {{on the west coast}} and it looks like summer is finally here. Most of our current activities in BC are focused on mountain pine beetle and lodgepole pine – planning for future seed needs, increasing yields and seed quantities from our orchards, increasing seed-use efficiency, and dealing with a very large increase in cone collections. This past year in BC, we have seen twice as many cones processed compared to the 10 -year average! It is June, we are still processing cones and foresters are still collecting. Many of you have heard about the mountain pine beetle and its impact – it certainly is a strong focal point for almost all of our current activities related to reforestation.

Fell out, (that means got up) {{this morning at}} 5 : 15 and marched about a mile to see some movies. They’re really something. Being restricted, {{that is not to}} be shown to the public, they give us {{information}} that’s really startling. The tops in the army and politics knew that this war was coming, and the appropriate plans of Germany, Japan, + Italy. It’s because of our stupid isolationism that we’re in this war right now. No one would listen to the smart fellows, Hali Salassi, Emperor of Ethiopia. Well that’s enough of that crap. We had lunch at 12 : 00 and then marched 3 miles to another post theater for another movie. By the way, the food here is terrific. After this movie we walked back the 3 miles and got our first touch of P. T. (Physical Torture). It was here that the guys started passing out, (so soon yet?) There were about 100 there and 20 passed out. It’s your own fault if you pass out though, because it depends mostly on your diet. Eat regular stay away from milk except at breakfast, keep your bowels good, and you’re okay. We’re waiting to eat now at 17 : 40, and then we’ll get our uniforms. Thank God we won’t have to go through anymore ribbing. Every time we passed a bunch of soldiers in circles the soldiers would take their caps off, put them over their heart, + sing the funeral march. Well, sweetheart gotta eat now. I love you with all my heart. (Je vous aime beaucoup, ma chere) Say <b>hello</b> to <b>everyone.</b> The best To The best Judd [Translation ends...|$|R

As you can see from the heading, it is just a stone’s throw from home. I miss the East very much. In Texas, the days are rather warm and the nights very cold. Especially at this time of year, {{there is a great deal}} of wind. There is not a tree in sight on the Post and outside the Post there is just scrub. The only hills one sees are the plateaus. No flowers, no green grass, nothing but plain flat land. My work so far has been varied. I am {{connected}} with Regimental Headquarters and work with the Personnel Officer and the Colonel’s Adjutant. However, I expect a change very shortly as there are new orders coming in. We are going to school to learn how to be clerks and also the administration of this particular corps. While we are going to school in the evening, we will also be working in the field receiving our basic training one day and clerking at Headquarters the next day. I can understand now why some of the boys did not answer the BSC’s letters and gifts. I even work on Sundays. I should appreciate it very much if you would say <b>hello</b> to <b>everyone</b> at Bryant and especially the BSC. I have just been ordered to drive the Adjutant around the Post this afternoon so I must end this letter before he calls me. You see we do everything here at Headquarters.

40|$|<b>Hello</b> <b>everyone</b> {{and welcome}} to the 19 th Security Protocols Workshop. The theme this year, which it is {{traditional}} to mention in the first session (and then never refer to again), is "Alice doesn't live here anymore". One of the perennial problems in analysing security protocols is how we distinguish Alice from not-Alice. The prevailing wisdom is that Alice possesses something which not-Alice does not. It might be knowledge of something that is used as a key. It might be that Alice possesses some physical characteristic, such as a biometric, or that there is something about the hardware that Alice is running on that is difficult to replicate. Or it might be that Alice possesses exclusive access to the interface to some distinguishing piece of hardware, like a dongle, although such hardware (when we think about it) usually belongs to some other security domain anyway. ?? 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|E
40|$|<b>Hello</b> <b>Everyone,</b> Once again, our {{section is}} {{co-sponsoring}} {{a number of}} very interesting programs. Many thanks to Halyna Liszczynskyj. These programs underscore the reality that the person-to-person service we provide is needed, regardless of how many virtual resources and services we offer. The next few years look very promising for cancer research and treatment. It is exciting to read about the investigation of anti-inflammatory drugs for their antineoplastic potential. Increasing knowledge of the natural molecule called TRAIL (tumor necrosis factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand) and its use with ingredients found in foods such as red wine and turmeric is intriguing. Motivation for more research in cancer epidemiology and prevention will probably include the recent reiteration that plastic containers release dioxins into your food when it is heated in microwave ovens, and the increased attention to the use of estrogens in beef and poultry to speed their growth (Pollan, 2002) ...|$|E

40|$|<b>Hello</b> <b>everyone!</b> I {{hope you}} {{all had a}} {{wonderful}} summer! It has been so nice {{to get out and}} about and enjoy the sunshine! Sunshine has many benefits, including boosting your immune system and helping your body convert a form of cholesterol present in your skin into Vitamin D. This vitamin benefits us by helping to maintain levels of minerals in our blood, promoting the absorption of calcium for stronger and denser bones and preventing tooth decay. Sunshine is also a great mood booster – it soothes nerves and can leave you with a feeling of well-being! As we move slowly into Autumn, the season is beginning to change and we notice the world around us transforming. It is still important to try and get out and about each day to enjoy the fresh air and the sunshine. Try and incorporate a walk into each day, and as we try new school routines, a walk can be a wonderful time in which to share the news our children bring home from school. The start of each new school year brings a period of excitement and anticipation for each child. Allow a little extra time to share the new experiences they encounter. Every child settles into a new routine at their own pace, so don’t be anxious if things are a little bumpy for a while, offer your child plenty of support and guidance and you will soon be trotting along smoothly. Remember to stay positive—even if you are feeling a little sad about your child starting school. Children need to feel that you are happy about them being away from you so that they don’t worry about you or feel that they are missing out on some other fun. Enjoy the mellow fruitfulness that Autumn brings...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Through the {{in-depth}} analysis {{of the features of}} Huabei rural industrialization, the unique factory regime in Baigou, Hebei, and the resulting special workers, this paper reveals two dilemmas the migrant workers in Baigou and larger Hubei area face: Because of the interpersonal network of labor market, personalized trade, familial labor process, and patrimonial management, the workers are unable to become either industrial working class or citizens. Facing this special group of workers, we still believe in their power of self-liberation. Drawing on Touraine’s action sociology and sociological intervention, and Burawoy’s public sociology and praxis-oriented research, we modify “sociological intervention ” according to the reality of Chinese society and propose the methodology of “strong sociological intervention ” whose vehicle is “Baigou Migrant Worker Night School. ” The night school provided workers with courses of labor law, English, and computer based on their actual needs. Labor law is the core to evoke the self-consciousness of the workers. Through communications in the night school and workers ’ real living circumstances, we collected their true information and treated it as the source of sociological knowledge. After three sessions of night school training, workers showed changes in skills, social, and psychological aspects, laying a foundation for the growth of self-consciousness. Keywords Factory regime. Publics. Social action. Sociological intervention It was the night of October 15 th, 2005 when I entered my classroom and saw all my students already there waiting for me. They were gossiping with each other and laughing excitedly. “ <b>Hello</b> <b>everyone,</b> ” Isaid, “ so {{nice to see you again}} in English class of our night school.
