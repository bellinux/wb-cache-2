5000|$|For most people, {{there is}} a slight {{learning}} curve with a manual transmission, which may be intimidating and unappealing for an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver.</b> Because the driver must develop a feel for properly engaging the clutch, an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> will often stall the engine. Most drivers {{can learn how to}} drive a car with a manual transmission in as little as an hour, although it may take weeks before it becomes [...] "second nature". Additionally, if an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> selects an inappropriate gear by mistake, damage to mechanical components and even loss of control may occur. Learning clutch/throttle pedal coordination can be made easier by using the clutch pedal only, on a level surface. This will allow the operator to gauge where the [...] "sweet spot" [...] of clutch engagement is. Correct [...] "release speed" [...] of the clutch pedal (slow for smooth, fast for abrupt) will indicate when and where throttle pedal use should occur.|$|E

5000|$|Rear biased weight {{distribution}} when loaded — A rear-wheel-drive car's {{centre of gravity}} is shifted rearward when heavily loaded with passengers or cargo, which may cause unpredictable handling behavior {{at the hands of}} an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver.</b> It needs to be noted that rear engine cars are by their very nature, rear weight biased.|$|E
50|$|Initially {{the voices}} of blame for the <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> of D 203 were almost unanimous. The 28-year-old had twice failed the {{locomotive}} driver's test given by the DB, and had then found work at a private rail transport firm, where, after passing the driver's test, he had primarily driven locomotives involved in switching work. He had then rejoined the DB, and after completing a short retraining programme, was permitted to also operate fast passenger trains.|$|E
50|$|Clutch delay valves {{operate as}} one-way {{restrictor}} valves that limit {{the volume of}} fluid that can move through the lines in a given time. This ensures a steady quick and firm engagement without being too fast for the drive train to handle since clutches can quickly disengage but re-engagement is damped. The clutch delay valve slows clutch engagement and was intended to reduce drivetrain shock {{in the event that}} an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> quickly engaged the clutch at higher revs.|$|E
40|$|Young {{drivers are}} {{involved}} disproportionately in serious vehicle crashes, and are involved disproportionately in sleepiness-related crashes. Specific difficulties in perceiving road hazards, and further impairment of this skill when sleepy, {{may contribute to}} this problem in young and <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers.</b> Perception, and response, to potential driving hazards is typically better in experienced <b>drivers</b> than in <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers.</b> However, the relationship between driver experience and sleepiness is not known. A sample of 34 young, and <b>inexperienced,</b> <b>drivers</b> (aged 17 - 24 years, with {{less than three years}} driving experience) and 33 older, and experienced, drivers (aged 28 - 36 years, with at least ten years driving experience) completed a video-based hazard perception task, in which they were instructed to anticipate a range of genuine traffic conflicts filmed locally. Their average response time to the traffic conflicts was calculated. Drivers were either tested at a time of increased sleepiness (3 am) or at a point of decreased sleepiness (10 am). As expected, the young, <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers</b> were significantly slower at identifying hazards than were the older, experienced drivers. While no overall effect of sleepiness on hazard perception was found, <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers</b> were slower on this measure at night. It appears that the hazard perception skills of the older, more experienced, drivers were relatively unaffected by mild increases in sleepiness while the hazard perception skills of the younger, <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers,</b> were significantly slowed by a mild increase in sleepiness. The results may explain the increased risk of driving while sleepy for young adult drivers. Sleepiness impairs elements of driving performance that are critical to safe driving, including hazard perception...|$|R

50|$|Collisions with buffer stops have {{frequently}} {{occurred over the}} years, the most recent fatal one in the UK being the London Cannon Street station rail crash in 1991. However, normally they occur at very low speed, less than 5 mph (8 km/h). The severity of the St Enoch accident was because the collision speed was as high as 15-20 mph (24-32 km/h). An <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> on a special train from Ardrossan was signalled into a platform {{that he did not}} realise was much shorter than the others, terminating short of the overall roof and well short of the main concourse. He therefore braked much too late. The solid masonry platform behind the buffer stops presented an immovable barrier and two coaches were completely telescoped.|$|E
5000|$|... 80,000 live spectators {{attended}} this 267-lap {{race with}} eleven caution periods for 43 laps.

Kasey Kahne qualified for the pole position with a top speed of 178.259 mph while the average speed of the actual race would end up being 125.375 mph. 12 drivers would fail to qualify for this race. Kurt Busch would get credit for the last-place finish due to a crash on the ninth lap. Kyle Busch, who was an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> in the #5 Chevrolet Monte Carlo for Hendrick Motorsports, would frequently collide with the wall.

50|$|At 06:42 on 17 September 1947, an army lorry {{conveying}} German Prisoners of war (POWs) {{crashed through}} the level crossing gates and {{collided with the}} 05:55 passenger train from Hull to Bridlington. Two British NCOs and seven POWs were killed. The accident was caused by an unauthorised driver losing control on the approach to the station level crossing and possibly {{to the ability to}} press both the accelerator and brake at the same time on the Bedford three-ton truck used. The report concludes:There can be no criticism of the railway arrangements at the crossing and it is clear that this accident, which might well have had even more serious consequences, if, for instance, the couplings of the train had not held and the derailment of the leading van had been followed by that of the coaches behind it, was due to careless handling of the lorry by an unauthorised and apparently <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver,</b> Staff Sgt.

50|$|A police {{spokesman}} for National Highways and Motorways disclosed that {{the bus was}} an old model, driven by an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> who had never reportedly previously travelled on highways. He also acknowledged {{that there may have}} been a failure on part of the motorway authorities in properly checking the overloaded bus and remarked that an investigation was being conducted. The 1981 model bus was reconditioned in 2002 and had been given a road-worthiness certificate by the vehicle examination authorities until late December 2011. Concerns and questions were raised as to how an old and unfit bus was still allowed to be operational on the road and how the bus was allowed to be illegally overloaded in excess to its maximum passenger capacity. A large number of families and relatives of the affected victims soon gathered outside the school after listening to the news. Some angry and infuriated people threw stones at district government officials and local parliamentarians who visited the school.|$|E
5000|$|On {{the morning}} of January 24, 1973, only three weeks after his last defense, Ohba {{died in a car}} accident. He was {{returning}} to the Teiken Gym where he both trained and lived. Ohba was driving his new 1973 ivory Chevrolet Corvette down an expressway in Tokyo, when he hit a heavy duty eleven ton parked truck on the shoulder of the opposite lane. His Corvette had jumped the road divider when he was unable to negotiate a turn and he was unable to regain control. He was driving around sixty, in a thirty-six mile per hour zone and was an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver,</b> having only obtained his driver's license three months before the crash. He was only 23 years old, and still in possession of the WBA title. [...] As a dutiful son, he had just bought his parents a new home.

50|$|In 1972 a {{tremendous}} {{effort was made}} to improve the handling of the 911. Due to the 911's unusual engine placement (rear-mounted, with most of the vehicle's weight concentrated over the rear axle) early 911's were prone to oversteer when driven at the limit, and could easily spin {{in the hands of an}} <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver.</b> In an attempt to remedy this, Porsche relocated the oil tank from its position behind the right rear wheel to in front of it. This had the effect of moving the weight of almost 8.5 l (9 US quarts) of oil from outside the wheelbase to inside, improving weight distribution and thus, handling. To facilitate filling of the oil tank, Porsche installed an oil filler door (much like the fuel filler door on the left front fender) on the right rear quarter panel. Unfortunately, this unique design was scrapped after only one year, some say because inattentive gas station attendants were putting gas in the oil tank. The oil tank was subsequently moved back to its original position for model year 1973, and remained there until it was moved back within the wheelbase for the 964 models.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Brake judder is a braking induced, forced {{vibration}} occurring in di erent types of vehicles. The judder frequency is {{directly proportional to}} the revolution speed of the wheel and therefore also to the velocity of the vehicle. The driver experiences judder as vibrations in the steering wheel, brake pedal and oor. In the higher frequency range, the structural vibrations are accompanied by a sound. Brake judder primarily a ects the comfort but could, when confronting an <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver</b> for the rst time, lead to faulty reactions and reduced driving safety. Furthermore, a speci c type of judder, so-called hot judder, is related to disc cracking. There are numerous publications available dealing with high frequency vibrations, such as brake squeal, including mathematical models for analysis and simulation. However, low frequency phenomena, such as brake judder and groan, have received much less attention. There is a growing interest from the automotive industry concerning brake judder. Even though few companies would admit {{that they have the}} problem, it is not unusual to meet people who have experienced the problem in their own passenger cars. Much of the knowledge concerning brake judder remains within the companies. Hence, very few people have the full picture. The purpose of the present paper is to give an overview of the brake judder problem...|$|E
40|$|Corn {{harvesting}} involves some losses. These losses {{result in}} decreased benefits. It {{is almost impossible}} to lower losses to zero percent but it can be controlled in an acceptable level. As a result of this research, appropriate methods are introduced to decrease losses and reduce waste. In this project, losses in different part of combine were measured and evaluated according to the available standard method (ASAE S 396. 2 & S 343. 3). Harvesting losses include preharvest and during harvest losses comprising ear loss and kernal loss in the header, cylinder and cleaning losses. This project was conducted on farmers’ lands in Gazvin province. Some assessments related to yield factors were evaluated in different parts of farm with specified area, e. g. Plant height, ear number, stem diameter, ear diameter, cob diameter, row/ear and seed/row. All losses evaluated in three treatments which they were: seed moisture content (w. b.) in three levels of 19 %, 23 % and 27 %, ground speed in three levels of 0. 8, 1. 2 and 1. 6 ms- 1 and cylinder speed of 400, 600 and 800 rpm. The split plot experimental design based on the randomised complete block design (RCBD) was used to evaluate treatments. Measured losses compared with standard values to introduce the proper methods to decrease losses and proper adjustments. The results show that appropriate seed moisture content, cylinder and ground speed were 23 %, 400 rpm and 1. 2 ms- 1, respectively. They had minimum total loss which WAS 1. 55 %, 2. 65 % and 2. 34 %, respectivily. The results also show that there was an ear loss in preharvest loss (because of bad weather condition) that was 0. 95 - 5. 42 %, also kernal loss on the header and cylinder loss which all related to improper adjustment of combine but total loss was in an acceptable level and standard. It was variable from 1. 55 % to 4. 02 %. Other parameters such as using <b>inexperienced</b> <b>driver,</b> improper combine adjustment, and also nonuniformity of field and ear moisture content in different parts of field prevent using the outputs and recommendations of this research...|$|E

40|$|Young, and {{particularly}} male drivers aged between 15 and 25 {{years of age}} are over represented in the crash statistics worldwide. In New Zealand, young drivers (15 - 24 years) represent only 15 % of the driver licensed population but typically contribute to more than 50 % of all fatal and injury crashes. The current {{study was conducted to}} investigate factors that may explain the over-representation of young drivers in crash statistics. For this research, a video based speed choice task was used to measure the chosen and estimated speeds on a selection of New Zealand road conditions of young <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers</b> and older experienced drivers. In addition, this study used a video based hazard perception dual task to compare the hazard perception skills of the same groups of drivers. Lastly, a number of self reported measures were used to examine if they could help characterise the drivers who consistently choose slower or higher speeds. Results revealed that the young <b>inexperienced</b> male <b>drivers</b> were more accurate at estimating the vehicle speeds and chose slower speeds across all the road conditions compared to the other drivers. In addition, drivers tended to choose slower speeds during night time driving and wet road conditions compared to daytime driving and dry road conditions, respectively. The young <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers</b> were better at the secondary tracking task of the hazard perception dual task compared to the older experienced drivers but then detected fewer hazards {{than any of the other}} drivers. In addition, drivers who chose consistently higher speeds in the speed choice task reported being more likely to engage in speeding, drink driving and become angry at other drivers while driving. Interestingly, drivers who consistently chose higher speeds were less confident in their driving abilities. The current findings suggest that young <b>inexperienced</b> male <b>drivers</b> were better at estimating the vehicle speeds and therefore chose slower speeds. In addition, it seems that the young <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers</b> tend to focus more on the secondary tracking task then detecting hazards compared to the older experienced drivers. This could relate to the fact that young <b>inexperienced</b> <b>drivers</b> need to use more attentional resources for the steering task and as a result they miss hazards. Lastly, the driver attitude questionnaire and the driving anger scale seem to be valid self-report measures in order to help characterise the drivers who consistently chose higher speeds in the speed choice task. Implications of the current study and future research are also discussed...|$|R
