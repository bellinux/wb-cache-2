50|$|Most of {{the above}} {{examples}} concern reinsurance contracts that cover more than one policy (treaty). Reinsurance can also be purchased on a per policy basis, in which case it is known as <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance.</b> <b>Facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> can be written on either a quota share or excess of loss basis. <b>Facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> contracts are commonly memorialized in relatively brief contracts known as facultative certificates and often are used for large or unusual risks that do not fit within standard reinsurance treaties due to their exclusions. The term of a facultative agreement coincides with the term of the policy. <b>Facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> is usually purchased by the insurance underwriter who underwrote the original insurance policy, whereas treaty reinsurance is typically purchased by a senior executive at the insurance company.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Facultative</b> <b>Reinsurance,</b> {{which is}} {{negotiated}} separately for each insurance policy that is reinsured. <b>Facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> is normally purchased by ceding companies for individual risks not covered, or insufficiently covered, by their reinsurance treaties, for amounts {{in excess of}} the monetary limits of their reinsurance treaties and for unusual risks. Underwriting expenses, and in particular personnel costs, are higher for such business because each risk is individually underwritten and administered. However, as they can separately evaluate each risk reinsured, the reinsurer's underwriter can price the contract more accurately to reflect the risks involved. Ultimately, a facultative certificate is issued by the reinsurance company to the ceding company reinsuring that one policy.|$|E
50|$|Both <b>facultative</b> and treaty <b>reinsurance</b> can {{be written}} on a {{proportional}} or non-proportional basis. Both these bases occur {{in a variety of}} often highly involved permutations.|$|R
50|$|Proportional reinsurance, {{which may}} arise in both <b>facultative</b> and treaty <b>reinsurance,</b> {{refers to a}} pro rata sharing of risks and losses, and {{premiums}} and income, between the primary insurer and the reinsurer.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Facultative</b> <b>{{reinsurance}}</b> is the reinsurance of {{a particular}} risk under a single policy (for a single or specific risk). It is facultative {{in the sense that}} the reinsurer has the choice to accept or reject the particular risk in question. This type of reinsurance arrangement is [...] "cumbersome," [...] writes Reinecke, because a separate negotiation is required for each separate risk which an insurer wishes to pass on to a reinsurer.|$|E
5000|$|Odyssey Re Holdings Corp. {{headquartered}} in Stamford, Connecticut, United States, is an underwriter {{of property and}} casualty treaty and <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance,</b> as well as specialty insurance. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Fairfax Financial, a financial services holding company. OdysseyRe operates through four divisions: Americas, EuroAsia, London Market and US Insurance. OdysseyRe offers a range of property, casualty, surety and credit, marine and energy, aviation and space reinsurance products from offices around the world.|$|E
50|$|The {{ceding company}} may seek surplus {{reinsurance}} {{to limit the}} losses it might incur from {{a small number of}} large claims as a result of random fluctuations in experience. In a 9 line surplus treaty the reinsurer would then accept up to $900,000 (9 lines). So if the insurance company issues a policy for $100,000, they would keep all of the premiums and losses from that policy. If they issue a $200,000 policy, they would give (cede) half of the premiums and losses to the reinsurer (1 line each). The maximum automatic underwriting capacity of the cedant would be $1,000,000 in this example. Any policy larger than this would require <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance.</b>|$|E
50|$|Also in 1929, General Reinsurance {{affirmed that}} it would be only a direct reinsurer. In 1945, General Reinsurance merged with Mellon Indemnity Corporation. In 1954, the company created the first {{professional}} casualty <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> department. Property facultative followed, beginning in 1956. North America branch offices were opened during this time. In the 1950s, General Reinsurance began writing reinsurance internationally, expanding in this area during the 1960s and 1970s. The company continued to grow through the next two decades, opening more U.S. and Canada branch offices and making various acquisitions. The company moved its headquarters from New York City to Greenwich, Connecticut in 1974, and then to Stamford, Connecticut in 1984. In 1980, General Re Corporation, the parent holding company, was listed on the New York Stock Exchange.|$|E

40|$|The main {{topic of}} my master thesis {{is the economy}} of <b>facultative</b> <b>{{reinsurance}}</b> {{from the point of}} view of a reinsurance company. First, the thesis briefly deals with the general structure of reinsurance and then is focused only on the facultative part. The thesis puts emphasis on the specific characteristics of <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and the creation of reinsurance slip and then uses this knowledge in a case study. The case study shows the risk from the insurance company and reinsurance company side and its aim is to create proper reinsurance structure for a power plant in Bulgaria.

40|$|The main {{topic of}} bachelor's thesis {{is the price}} of {{proportional}} reinsurance. Firstly, the thesis is focused on general definition of reinsurance. It tries to provide basic information to distinguish differences between obligatory and <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> and proportional and non-proportional reinsurance. Then it follows up with the structure of price in proportional reinsurance, in detail analyzes individual components and shows the calculations on model examples. Practical part deals with the use of particular commissions and their comparison. Thesis points out the situations when the selected commission is more convenient for insurer or reinsurer...|$|E
40|$|Do reinsurers {{insure the}} {{liability}} {{faced by the}} reinsured under its original insurance contract? Where the reinsurance and direct insurance policies are written in identical terms, is it enough for the reinsured to prove its liability under the original insurance policy {{in order to make}} a successful claim against its reinsurers? These questions are crucial, because they determine whether the terms of the reinsurance are to be construed identically to those of the direct policy even though they have different governing laws. The issues came before the House of Lords in Wasa International Insurance Co Ltd v Lexington Insurance Co [2009] UKHL 40 and the answers were provided in a judgment delivered on 30 July 2009, the last day of the operation of the House of Lords as a court.

40|$|Satellite {{insurance}} liabilities for {{a portfolio of}} direct insurance contracts or <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> contracts consist largely of unearned premium liabilities, with relatively smaller contributions from reported and unreported losses. As in life insurance, {{there is a high}} probability of loss at launch (birth),and in the early period of operation (infancy), a period of low risk of loss throughout the majority of operation, and a period of high probability of loss {{towards the end of the}} satellite's life. This paper describes the risks covered under a satellite policy and discusses the value of using a simulation model based on an active life approach to estimate the expected losses related to a satellite insurance portfolio's unearned exposure. In addition to providing an estimate of the expected losses, such a model allows for the evaluation and incorporation of the benefits from a reinsurance program protecting the portfolio. This model can also be used to estimate the anticipated benefit from reinsurance protections being considered for the portfolio and to price treaty reinsurance contracts. This paper discusses the concepts underlying the construction of such a model and describes the types of information needed to estimate the model parameters. As part of this discussion, we provide a brief history of the industry and discuss some of the hazards to which satellites are exposed...|$|E
40|$|This paper explores {{insurance}} as {{a source}} of financial system vulnerability. It provides a brief overview of the insurance industry and reviews the risks it faces, as well as several recent failures of insurance companies that had systemic implications. Assimilation of banking-type activities by life insurers appears to be the key systemic vulnerability. Building on this experience and the experience gained under the FSAP, the paper proposes key indicators that should be compiled and used for surveillance of financial soundness of insurance companies and the insurance sector as a whole.

40|$|Teniendo en cuenta la importancia a nivel latinoamericano del contrato de reaseguro facultativo, se ha hecho necesario exponer la siguiente presentaciónreflexiva acerca del mismo, no sólo desde el punto de vista de la parte técnica,sino también desde la práctica; repasando situaciones particulares como las controversias o polémicas respecto de las condiciones del contrato de reaseguro, los comentarios, decisiones y precedentes que se han marcado por parte de la jurisprudencia inglesa. Así, la evaluación parte desde el concepto {{mismo del}} contrato de reaseguro, pasando por sus partes, su celebración, el {{principio}} básico de la buena fe, condiciones y las cláusulas de control y cooperación. Resaltando elimportante encuadre de todos estos temas no sólo jurisprudencialmente, como ya se ha mencionado, sino también con conclusiones de algunos tribunales y académicos ingleses. Taking into account {{how important the}} reinsurance policy is at the Latin American level and notwithstanding that there’re two types of reinsurance, the present research {{will focus on the}} <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> as it has become necessary to address the topic as a process of reflection and thought not only from the technical standpoint but also from the practical viewpoint by reviewing particular situations such as controversies or discussions about the conditions of that policy, comments, decisions and precedents that have been key in English jurisprudence.  All is presented as an assessment between Latin American reinsurance companies and reinsurance companies in the English arena (London). Hence, the review starts on the very concept of the reinsurance policy, going through its parts, its execution, the good faith principle, conditions, loss of the facultative contract and control and cooperation clauses. The emphasis on the legal nature of the contract, the reinsurance broker, the insured risk and the importance of relevant cases and the day to day development along discussions generated are in great part analyzed along with English jurisprudence, tribunals and English scholars in trying to inform about the development of the contract, its usefulness and the least positive consequences that may arise, all of which is part of this article. ...|$|E
40|$|The Full Reinsurance clause {{by which}} a {{reinsurer}} agrees to be bound by the same terms and conditions as the original policy and commits to follow the reinsured’s settlements is widely used in London Market <b>facultative</b> <b>reinsurance</b> contracts. In most disputes the outcome depends upon resolving the fundamental question of whether reinsurance is either a further insurance on the subject matter insured or is a reinsurance of the liability of the reinsured under the direct policy. The interpretation of the clause had not been settled until the recent House of Lords decision on Wasa International Insurance Co Ltd v Lexington Insurance Co [2009] UKHL 40 where their Lordships adopted the view that reinsurance is not a liability insurance but a further insurance on the subject matter insured by the reinsured. Settlement clauses are also widely used in the United States, albeit with wording slightly {{different from that of}} the full reinsurance clause but there is broad consensus in the US courts that the words ‘follow the fortunes’ and ‘follow the settlements’ are interchangeable. There are both similarities and differences between the two common law systems: in England the full reinsurance clause has to be express, whereas in the US there is a debate as to whether it may be implied; in England the nature of reinsurance remains unresolved, in the US the liability approach has been adopted; post-settlement allocations have created huge problems in the US but have scarcely been discussed in England; the US cases have not proceeded on the basis of incorporation whereas in England the scope of incorporation has been much discussed. These differences arise mainly from the understanding of reinsurance in the two systems, and the present thesis aims to explain these conflicting understandings by describing the relationship between reinsurers and reinsureds in the light of ‘as original’, ‘follow the form’ and ‘settlement’ clauses.
