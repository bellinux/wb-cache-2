40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effects of housing systems on {{physiological}} and immunological responses as stress indicators in laying hens. A total of 500 White Leghorn aged 16 weeks were allotted into ten conventional cages (10 birds/cage and 810 cm 2 /bird) and four floor pens (100 birds/pen and 2, 800 cm 2 /bird) for 24 weeks. The <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> in conventional cages with higher stocking density resulted in a significantly (P< 0. 05) lower BW compared with those housed in floor pens with lower stocking density without affecting the relative weights of immune organs between housing conditions. In plasma biochemical values, cholesterol and corticosterone were significantly (P< 0. 05) lower in the <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> in floor pens compared with those housed in conventional cages. In pro-inflammatory cytokines, hepatic interleukin (IL) - 10 and interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) levels were significantly (P< 0. 05) higher in the <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> in conventional cages compared with those kept in floor pens. Splenic and thymic IFN-γ expression was significantly (P< 0. 05) up-regulated in the hens kept in conventional cages compared with those kept in floor pens without affecting IL- 1, IL- 10, lipopolysaccharide- induced tumor necrosis factor-α factor (LITAF) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS).

40|$|ABSTRACT Hisex hens (20 {{weeks of}} age) were housed one or three per 30. 5 X 40. 6 cm cage (Experiment 1). One {{half of the}} hens at each density {{received}} a constant 15 -hr photoperiod (0500 to 2000 hr). The other half received a 15 -hr photoperiod that was increased 15 min every 5 days {{to a maximum of}} 18 hr (0200 to 2000). Total feed consumption, egg production, egg weight, specific gravity, body checks, and time of oviposition were determined at various intervals throughout a 12 -month period. Shell weight, thickness, and breaking strength were determined on normal and body-checked eggs paired for equal egg weight and specific gravity (Experiments 2 to 4). <b>Hens</b> <b>housed</b> three per cage laid 2. 2 times as many body-checked eggs as <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> one per cage. Hens receiving the 18 -hr photoperiod laid 2. 4 times as many body-checked eggs and laid significantly earlier in the day than hens receiving the 15 -hr photoperiod. Hens receiving the 15 -hr photoperiod had significantly greater egg specific gravity and significantly smaller eggs than hens receiving~th"e 18 jTr photoperiod. <b>Hens</b> <b>housed</b> one per cage and supplied the 18 -hr photoperiod laid significantly more eggs than <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> three per cage.

It was concluded that photoperiod (18 and 15 hr) had little or no effect on production or feed ^ consumption, but the shorter photoperiod significantly reduced the incidence of body-checked eggs by at least 50 % and significantly increased egg specific gravity.

Monitoring performance of the final hybrid laying type hens consisted of rearing pullets until the age of 126 days and the laying period to 518 days of age. Hatching eggs of Isa Brown hybrid for keeping in cages had significantly higher weight and fertilization, but lower hatchability of fertilized eggs than for keeping on litter. Hybrid Bovans Brown eggs for hatching intended for keeping in cages had lower weight and lower fertilization and hatching rate of fertilized eggs than eggs for keeping on litter. At the end of 18 th week of rearing of pullets Isa Brown and Bovans Brown reared in cages had significantly lower body weight compared to pullets reared on litter. In pullets housed in cages feed consumption in 126 days was significantly higher compared with pullets reared on litter. During the rearing of pullets mortality was not recorded. Hybrid Isa Brown showed a higher body weight if kept in cages while hybrid Bovans Brown on litter. Both hybrids in battery cages had lower feed consumption per 1 egg and 1 feeding day.

40|$|A {{systematic}} review of investigations on productivity, mortality and cannibalism of laying <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> in aviaries is presented. In Part One we reviewed {{the studies that}} compared these parameters between laying <b>hens</b> <b>housed</b> in aviaries and in conventional cages. In Part Two we investigated the relative impact of strain, beak trimming and rearing condition on productivity and mortality in aviaries. The comparative analysis revealed that aviary hens consumed 3. 0 % more food than caged hens, and food conversion was 6. 7 % higher in aviaries than in cages. On the other hand, the mortality rate and cannibalism rate {{did not differ significantly}} between the two housing systems. The analysis of causes of variation in productivity, mortality rate and cannibalism rate in aviaries revealed a strong effect of strain. Beak trimming was associated with a reduced prevalence of cannibalism rates but had no effect on overall mortality. It also reduced egg weight and food consumption. Early access to litter during the rearing period had a positive effect on egg weight; egg mass, food conversion and mortality rate. In conclusion, we found a slightly reduced productivity of aviaries in relation to cages although the mortality rates and the prevalence of cannibalism did not differ between these housing systems.

Shaver White <b>hens</b> were <b>housed</b> from 21 to 61 wk in either conventional battery cages (n = 500; 10 cages; 5 hens/cage; floor space = 561. 9 cm(2) /hen) or enriched cages (n = 480; 2 cages; 24 hens/cage; floor space = 642. 6 cm(2) /hen) and were replicated 10 times. Enriched cages provided hens with a curtained nesting area, scratch pad, and perches. Production parameters and egg quality measures were recorded throughout the experiment. Plumage condition was evaluated at 37 and 61 wk. Bone quality traits and immunological response parameters were measured at 61 wk, and 59 and 61 wk, respectively. Hen-day egg production, feed consumption, egg weight, and percentage of cumulative mortality of laying hens were not affected by the cage designs. Specific gravity and the percentage of cracked and soft-shelled eggs were also similar between the 2 housing systems. The incidence of dirty eggs was, however, significantly higher (P < 0. 0001) in enriched cages than in conventional cages.
