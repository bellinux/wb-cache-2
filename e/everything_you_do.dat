500|$|Certain {{aspects of}} Windows 8.1 were also {{cause for concern}} because of their privacy implications. In his review of Windows 8.1, Joel Hruska noted that Microsoft had {{deliberately}} made it harder for users to create a [...] "Local" [...] account that is not tied to a Microsoft account for syncing, as it [...] " [...] clear that the company really, really, wants you to share <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> with it, and that’s not something {{an increasing number of}} people and businesses are comfortable doing." [...] Woody Leonhard of InfoWorld noted that by default Windows 8.1's [...] "Smart Search" [...] system sends search queries and other information to Microsoft, which could be used for targeted advertising. Leonhard considered this to be ironic, given that Microsoft had criticized Google's use of similar tactics with its [...] "Scroogled" [...] advertising campaign.|$|E
500|$|Israeli actress Hadas Yaron, then aged 20, {{was cast}} {{for the role}} of Shira, the protagonist of the film. She commented that her {{character}} [...] "is much more naïve at 18 than I was when I was 18, and there was something so special about that and it was like going back to the basics". Yaron was unfamiliar with Orthodox practice prior to participating in Fill the Void. In order to become better acquainted with Shira's lifestyle, she started memorizing all of the Hebrew blessings, saying, [...] "There's something so beautiful about it because you're being so grateful all the time for <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and hoping that everything works out okay and I started doing those blessings every day and it sounds silly but it helps you feel that you are closer to the character." ...|$|E
500|$|Mars {{says that}} the trust that he, Levine and Lawrence have built in seven years of working {{together}} is essential. He added [...] "I may say, 'Yo, I like this song,' but if Ari or Phil say it's the corniest shit they've ever heard, I trust them. And the other way around. We all know when we're onto something...We also know when something's not jelling. And that's the thing you pray you will always have. You can't believe that <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is hot." [...] Nevertheless, Levine points to the musical influences {{the three of them}} share completing his idea [...] "It's about finding ways to mix the classic we all love with modern songs. That's why people connect to the music on multiple levels: It's familiar-sounding but new-classic songwriting and instrumentation with a little twist".|$|E

500|$|Hugh Syme {{provided}} the artwork for Octavarium. The idea of depicting a giant Newton's cradle was {{born out of}} discussions between Syme and Portnoy. The two talked about how [...] "for <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> in music you create either a cluster or triad", according to Syme. [...] "And then it became evident that for every action there is an opposite reaction. So I thought we could do something based on the Newton's cradle." [...] There are numerous references to the numbers five and eight throughout the artwork, alluding to the album's concept. For example, the Newton's cradle has eight suspended balls, and there are five birds on the cover. The album booklet features an octagonal maze, spider and octopus, among other references. The landscape on the cover is made up of a sky and grass from Indiana, and a background from the Lake District.|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay (Faraway, So Close!)" [...] was {{directed}} by Wim Wenders, produced by Debbie Mason, and edited by Jerry Chater. The video was filmed in Berlin {{over the course of}} three days, primarily in black-and-white but with some sequences in colour. It contains cameos of some of the actors who appeared in Faraway, So Close!, including Otto Sander, as well as Wenders' nephew. Several scenes are taken directly from Faraway, So Close! and Wenders' 1987 film Wings of Desire, which also served as the principal inspiration for the video's premise. Wenders noted that [...] "making a video is really a very different ballgame. You have the script, so to speak, because you have the song, and <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> is in order to help the song shine... You want to make that song look as good as possible and sound as good as possible and as interesting as possible." [...] Several shots depict the band members standing on the statue of Victoria, a monument {{at the top of the}} Berlin Victory Column; a model of the angel was created for those scenes. Leftover military equipment from the Cold War, including the Soviet MiG, were included in the background.|$|E
500|$|Molyneux {{said that}} might have been [...] "insanely ambitious" [...] with regard to the {{standards}} they set themselves for the graphics, because the system requirements were high and much of the custom software needed to be written. One such program was a terrain-editing tool named Leadhead. He stated that they went from [...] "bizarre ideas", to [...] "the best game I have ever seen". The villagers' artificial intelligence had to be restricted by giving some control to the Village Centre as there was no limit on the number of villagers. Molyneux said of the creature's artificial intelligence, [...] "part of the game itself learns from <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> and tailors itself to you", and described the creature as [...] "an astonishing piece of work". He also commented that the last months of development were [...] "the hardest any of us has ever had to work", and that [...] "without the right team, this game never would have happened." [...] The models for the trees, bushes, and other landscape features were created in 3D Studio Max, and initial graphics development was done in 2D using Adobe Photoshop. Later development was done using other custom software. Clan multiplayer, where multiple players play as one god, was developed in a rush; its interface had to be developed in two weeks. Black & Whites online community was handled by two servers in London, where the clan creatures were stored to minimise the possibility of cheating.|$|E

The reason is because I know you to be wretchedly selfish. I believed in <b>you</b> before. <b>Everything</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> seemed right. That was because I was a fool, because you had filled my brain with impossible fancies, because I saw <b>you</b> and <b>everything</b> that <b>you</b> <b>did</b> through a distorted mirror." ...|$|R

He particularly praised the economic system on which the game is built, calling it [...] "so sound that <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> makes perfect sense." [...] He also lauded the graphics and variety of animations. His main criticism was that {{he felt it was}} not overly different from the first title, writing [...] "Blue Byte have not fundamentally altered the game {{in the same way that}} MicroProse did with Civilization II." ...|$|E

She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to him that I was an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I asked him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> will give you some experience!'

2500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is about calling upon the love of that special one when times get tough. For Aguilera, the song [...] "is about that sort of perfect love, which we all dream. This kind of song {{can make you feel}} safe and warm anytime of the year. And there's no one better to turn to for that than my own mother," [...] she claimed. [...] "For a shield, from the storm for a friend, for a love to keep me safe and warm, I turn to you/For the {{strength}} to be strong, for the will to carry on/For <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> for everything that's true, I turn to you," [...] she sings in the chorus.|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Michael {{performed}} a free concert for NHS nurses in London {{to thank the}} nurses who had cared for his late mother. He told the audience: [...] "Thank you for <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> — some people appreciate it. Now if we can only get {{the government to do}} the same thing." [...] In 2007, Michael sent the £1.45million piano that John Lennon used to write [...] "Imagine" [...] around the US on a [...] "peace tour", displaying at places where violence had taken place, such as Dallas's Dealey Plaza, where US President John F. Kennedy had been shot. He devoted his 2007 concert in Sofia, from his [...] "Twenty Five Tour" [...] to the Bulgarian nurses prosecuted in the HIV trial in Libya. On 17 June 2008, Michael said he was thrilled by California's legalisation of same-sex marriage, calling the move [...] "way overdue".|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, Paul VI {{decided on}} the {{creation}} of a joint working group with the World Council of Churches to map all possible avenues of dialogue and cooperation. In the following three years, eight sessions were held which resulted in many joint proposals. It was proposed to work closely together in areas of social justice and development and Third World Issues such as hunger and poverty. On the religious side, it was agreed to share together in the Week of Prayer for Christian Unity, to be held every year. The joint working group was to prepare texts which were to be used by all Christians. [...] On 19 July 1968, the meeting of the World Council of Churches took place in Uppsala, Sweden, which Pope Paul called a sign of the times. He sent his blessing in an ecumenical manner: [...] "May the Lord bless <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>do</b> for the case of Christian Unity." [...] The World Council of Churches decided on including Catholic theologians in its committees, provided they have the backing of the Vatican.|$|E
