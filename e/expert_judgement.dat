The need to compare languages with regard to their complexity resulted in a multitude of approaches and methods, ranging from accounts targeting specific structural features to global quantification of variation more generally. In this paper, we investigate the degree to which morphological complexity measures are mutually correlated in a sample of more than 500 languages of 101 language families. We use human <b>expert</b> <b>judgements</b> from the World Atlas of Language Structures (WALS), and compare them to four quantitative measures automatically calculated from language corpora.

The financial implications of the practical implementation of these results are discussed.

40|$|The {{usage of}} Engineered Nanoparticles (ENPs) in {{consumer}} products {{is relatively new}} {{and there is a}} need to conduct environmental risk assessment (ERA) to evaluate their impacts on the environment. However, alternative approaches are required for ERA of ENPs because of the huge gap in data and knowledge compared to conventional pollutants and their unique properties that make it difficult to apply existing approaches. This study aims to propose an ERA approach for ENPs by integrating Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and fuzzy inference models which provide a systematic evaluation of risk factors and reducing uncertainty about the data and information, respectively. Risk is assumed to be the combination of occurrence likelihood, exposure potential and toxic effects in the environment. A hierarchy was established to evaluate the sub factors of these components. Evaluation was made with fuzzy numbers to reduce uncertainty and incorporate the <b>expert</b> <b>judgements.</b> Overall score of each component was combined with fuzzy inference rules by using <b>expert</b> <b>judgements.</b> Proposed approach reports the risk class and its membership degree such as Minor (0. 7).

40|$|CO 2 {{capture and}} storage (CCS) {{is likely to}} become a {{necessary}} option in mitigating global climate change. However, lack of detailed knowledge on potential deep geological reservoirs can hamper the development of CCS. In this paper a new methodology is presented to assess and create exploration priority lists for poorly known reservoirs. Geological <b>expert</b> <b>judgements</b> are used as a basis in a two-stage geotechno-economic approach, where first an estimate of the practical reservoir capacity is calculated, and secondly source–sink matching is used for calculating an estimate of the matched capacity and the reservoir development probability. This approach is applied to Belgium, demonstrating how a priority ranking for reservoirs can be obtained based on limited available data and large uncertainties. The results show the Neeroeteren Formation as the most prospective reservoir, followed by the Buntsandstein Formation and the Dinantian reservoirs. The findings indicate that CO 2 export to reservoirs in neighbouring countries seems inevitable; still, there is a 70 % chance storage will happen in Belgian reservoirs, with an average matched capacity estimate of 110 Mt CO 2. These quantitative results confirm the qualitative resource pyramid classification of potential reservoirs. For Belgium, a high economic risk is attached to reservoir exploration and development. Exploration remains however a necessity if CCS is to be deployed. Furthermore, it is shown that the presented methodology is indeed capable of producing realistic results, and that using <b>expert</b> <b>judgements</b> for reservoir assessments is valid and beneficial. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|<b>Expert</b> <b>judgements</b> are {{potentially}} a valuable {{source of information}} in land degradation assessment, especially in areas where data paucity impedes the use of quantitative models. However, expert opinions are also much disputed {{because they are not}} tested for consistency, abstain from formal documentation, while their quantitative interpretation is inherently unidentifiable. This paper evaluates and formalizes the use of <b>expert</b> <b>judgements</b> to conduct a nationwide water erosion hazard assessment in Ethiopia. We, therefore, test the experts' judgement for consistency, its correlation with quantitative measurements on soil loss and its reproducibility. The study uses an Ethiopian and an international dataset for which <b>experts</b> gave qualitative <b>judgements</b> on water erosion hazard, for well-described sites under different types of land uses. Experts show a high consistency in their judgements on land degradation, but a comparison with quantitative soil losses from runoff plots reveals that boundaries of middle classes vary widely between experts, while they tend to overestimate soil loss. Reproducing expert opinions with an ordered logit model shows a reasonable accuracy in predicting presence or absence of erosion, yet the model is less precise in distinguishing between higher erosion classes. In 58 per cent of the cases, the model gives a similar classification as the experts, in 19 per cent the model estimates higher and, more seriously, in 23 per cent a lower erosion class. Mapping the model results for Ethiopia demonstrates a high erosion hazard for land under annual crop cultivation, while erosion under perennial crops, rangeland and forest is absent or moderate. The likelihood of the model to select the correct hazard class for rangeland is relatively high but medium to low probabilities prevail for erosion classes of other land uses. The model needs a further justification to give adequate results for arid areas. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
