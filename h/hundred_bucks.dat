40|$|In goat milk {{the most}} {{abundant}} proteins are the casein genes, CSN 1 S 1, CSN 2, CSN 1 S 2, and CSN 3. Mutations have been identified within these genes affecting the level of gene expression, and effects on milk production traits have been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect polymorphisms (SNPs) in the casein genes of Norwegian goats, resolve haplotype structures within the loci, and assess the effect of these haplotypes on milk production traits. Four <b>hundred</b> thirty-six Norwegian <b>bucks</b> were genotyped for 39 polymorphic sites across the four loci. The numbers of unique haplotypes present in each locus were 10, 6, 4, and 8 for CSN 1 S 1, CSN 2, CSN 1 S 2, and CSN 3, respectively. The effects of the CSN 1 S 1 haplotypes on protein percentage and fat kilograms were significant, as were the effects of CSN 3 haplotypes on fat percentage and protein percentage. A deletion in exon 12 of CSN 1 S 1, unique to the Norwegian goat population, explained the effects of CSN 1 S 1 haplotypes on fat kilograms, but not protein percentage. Investigation of linkage disequilibrium between all possible pairs of SNPs revealed higher levels of linkage disequilbrium for SNP pairs within casein loci than for SNP pairs between casein loci, likely reflecting low levels of intragenic recombination. Further, there was evidence for a site of preferential recombination between CSN 2 and CSN 1 S 2. The value of the haplotypes for haplotype-assisted selection (HAS) is discussed...|$|R

50|$|On 21 September 1956, the Army {{reactivated}} the Screaming Eagles. The {{departure of}} the 11th Airborne Division for NATO duty in Germany and according to a display board at the Fort Campbell museum, the loss of jump pay on the local Hopkinsville-Clarksville economy caused the local Congressmen {{to go to the}} Pentagon asking for a favor. Fort Campbell's straddling of the Kentucky-Tennessee border made it of interest to three Congressional districts (two Tennessee, one Kentucky) and four Senators. In those days, the <b>hundred</b> <b>bucks</b> a month almost doubled a private’s take-home pay, and most of that got spent in Hopkinsville or Clarksville, helping what were still economically depressed towns surrounded by farms. The fact that the division’s wartime commander, then-Major General Maxwell Taylor, was now the Army Chief of Staff surely played a part in the 101st’s return to active duty. The Army needed another rapidly deployable unit to face Cold War contingencies, and Taylor figured it should be his old one. The reactivated 101st was formed using the assets of the 187th 508th Airborne RCTs, plus volunteers from the deactivating 6th Infantry Division run through parachute school either on Campbell or at Fort Benning.|$|E

Manually annotating corpora or manually developing any other linguistic resource, such as a set of judgments about system outputs, represents such a high cost that many researchers are looking for alternative solutions to the standard approach. MTurk is becoming a popular one. However, as in any scientific endeavor involving humans, there is an unspoken ethical dimension involved in resource construction and system evaluation, and {{this is especially true of}} MTurk. We would like here to raise some questions about the use of MTurk. To do so, we will define precisely what MTurk is and what it is not, highlighting the issues raised by the system. We hope that this will point out opportunities for our community to deliberately value ethics above cost savings. What Is MTurk? What Is It Not? MTurk is an on-line crowdsourcing, microworking 1 system which enables elementary tasks to be performed by a huge number of people (typically called “Turkers”) on-line. Ideally, these tasks are meant to be solved by computers, but they still remain out of computational reach (for instance, the translation of an English sentence into Urdu). ∗ INIST-CNRS/LIPN, 2 allée de Brabois, F- 54500 Vandoeuvre-lès-Nancy, France...|$|E
