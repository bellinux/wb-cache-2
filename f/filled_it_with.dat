5|$|Sapumal Kumaraya (also {{known as}} Chempaha Perumal in Tamil), who ruled the Jaffna kingdom {{on behalf of}} the Kotte kingdom is {{credited}} with either building or renovating the Nallur Kandaswamy temple. Singai Pararasasegaram is credited with building the Sattanathar temple, the Vaikuntha Pillaiyar temple and the Veerakaliamman temple. He built a pond called Yamuneri and <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> water from the Yamuna river of North India, which is considered holy by Hindus. He was a frequent the visitor of the Koneswaram temple, as was his son and successor King Cankili I. King Jeyaveera Cinkaiariyan had the traditional history of the temple compiled as a chronicle in verse, entitled Dakshina Kailasa Puranam, known today as the Sthala Puranam of Koneshwaram Temple. Major temples were normally maintained by the kings and a salary was paid from the royal treasury to those who worked in the temple, unlike in India and rest of Sri Lanka, where religious establishments were autonomous entities with large endowments of land and related revenue.|$|E
5|$|Amazing was published, {{with some}} interruptions, for almost eighty years, {{going through a}} half-dozen owners and many editors as it {{struggled}} to be profitable. Gernsback was forced into bankruptcy and {{lost control of the}} magazine in 1929, and by 1938 it was purchased by Ziff-Davis, who hired Raymond A. Palmer as editor. Palmer made the magazine successful though it was not regarded as a quality magazine within the science fiction community. In the late 1940s Amazing presented as fact stories about the Shaver Mystery, a lurid mythos that explained accidents and disaster as the work of robots named deros, which led to dramatically increased circulation but widespread ridicule. Amazing switched to a digest size format in 1953, shortly {{before the end of the}} pulp-magazine era. It was sold to Sol Cohen's Universal Publishing Company in 1965, which <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> reprinted stories but did not pay a reprint fee to the authors, creating a conflict with the newly formed Science Fiction Writers of America. Ted White took over as editor in 1969, eliminated the reprints and made the magazine respected again: Amazing was nominated for the prestigious Hugo award three times during his tenure in the 1970s. Several other owners attempted to create a modern incarnation of the magazine in the following decades, but publication was suspended after the March 2005 issue. A new incarnation appeared in July 2012 as an online magazine.|$|E
5|$|On September 26, 1964, Nguyễn Khánh and {{the senior}} {{officers}} in his military junta created a semblance of civilian rule by forming the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body akin to a legislature. This came after lobbying by American officials—led by Ambassador Maxwell Taylor—in Vietnam, as they placed great value in the appearance of civilian legitimacy, which they saw as vital to building a popular base for any government. Khánh put his rival General Dương Văn Minh—who he had deposed in a January 1964 coup—in charge of picking the 17 members of the HNC, and Minh <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> figures sympathetic to him. The HNC then made a resolution to recommend a political model with a powerful head of state, which would likely be Minh, given their sympathy towards him. Khánh did not want his rival taking power, so he and the Americans convinced the HNC to dilute {{the powers of the}} position to make it unappealing to Minh, who was then sent on an overseas diplomatic goodwill tour to remove him from the political scene. However, Minh was back in South Vietnam after a few months and the power balance in the junta was still fragile.|$|E

It was hit by anti-aircraft fire and crashed in no-mans land between the French and German lines. Bozděch helped the injured Duval to an abandoned farm house nearby, wherein the Czech airman discovered a German Shepherd puppy on the floor in the kitchen. While the dog was not initially fond of Duval, it accepted Bozděch. Concerned that the puppy was emaciated, he began to feed it chocolate, but it would not eat it until the rations were partially melted. Bozděch also found an old frying pan, <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> snow and melted it so that the dog could drink it.|$|E
25|$|A {{short while}} earlier in September, before Minh was sent overseas, the junta {{decided to create}} a semblance of {{civilian}} rule by creating the High National Council (HNC), an appointed advisory body that was to begin the transitional to constitutional rule.

The HNC then selected Phan Khắc Sửu as chief of state, and Sửu selected Trần Văn Hương as prime minister, although the junta remained the real power.

500|$|The {{continuation}} of the verse and completion of the sentence, [...] (by all generations) {{is given to the}} chorus, expressing the fullness of the praise. Hogwood compares the [...] "crowd effect" [...] to Bach's the crowds in Bach's Passions. The movement is a fugue which follows the stretto principle from the start and throughout. Beginning in measure 10, the voices enter, again half a measure apart, with the bass beginning. From measure 15, every entrance is one note higher, covering an octave as a symbol of completeness (omnes), again in the fast succession of half a measure: A, SII, SI, T, B, SII, SI, A. In a final sequence beginning in measure 21, the voices enter from bottom to top on the same note, only one beat apart. After a [...] "very triumphal, but unfinished, chord" [...] and a general pause, the movement concludes repeating the theme in homophony. Steinberg comments that Bach took the idea of separating the two words {{from the rest of the}} verse from earlier models, but <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> an [...] "exciting sense of drama" [...] by the piled-up entrances in a [...] "tremendous march across key after key", leading to [...] "tense dissonances", finally a [...] "dramatic pause" [...] before the last statement.|$|E

500|$|The {{weather was}} {{unremarkable}} for two years. In 1928, construction was completed on the Tamiami Trail, named {{because it was}} the only road spanning between Tampa and Miami. The builders attempted to construct the road several times before they blasted the muck down to the limestone, <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> rock and paved over it. Hard rains in the summer caused Lake Okeechobee to rise several feet; this was noticed by a local newspaper editor who demanded it be lowered. However, on September 16, 1928 came a massive storm, now known as the 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane. Thousands drowned when Lake Okeechobee breached its levees; the range of estimates of the dead spanned from 1,770 (according to the Red Cross) to 3,000 or more. Many were swept away and never recovered. The majority of the dead were black migrant workers who had recently settled in or near Belle Glade. The catastrophe made national news, and although the governor again refused aid, after he toured the area and counted 126bodies still unburied or uncollected a week after the storm, he activated the National Guard to assist in the cleanup, and declared in a telegram: [...] "Without exaggeration, the situation in the storm area beggars description".|$|E
500|$|Comet {{was portrayed}} by five horses, {{each with a}} {{different}} talent. The main horse was Copper, chosen by veteran wrangler Gordon Spencer because it was calm and gentle. Campbell nicknamed the horse [...] "Leadbelly" [...] due to its ability to remain calm during action or dialogue scenes. Another horse, Boss, was used for long-range shots, chase scenes, and elaborate stunts, such as leaps through windows. Ace was called in when the crew had to shoot scenes in which the horse reared. Near {{the end of the}} season, a horse named Comet was trained, its name chosen so that the horse would get used to hearing it on set. The [...] "true show horse" [...] was Strip, which was adept at doing tricks, such as lip movements, head nods, and hoof stamping. According to Spencer, all those stunts [...] "as well as tying the knots and opening the door and going into rooms and all of that" [...] were done by Strip. For these scenes, Spencer would stand off-camera and use a stick to signal Strip. Campbell had a special pocket sewn into his costume and <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> grain to reward Strip after every take. No other horse had more scenes than Strip and Copper. [...] With white colorings on his nose and legs, Strip's appearance was chosen for Brisco's steed; Copper and the other horses were touched up with [...] "clown white" [...] greasepaint to match Strip's markings.|$|E
500|$|The {{estate was}} {{inherited}} in 1739 by Charles Legh, who {{embarked on a}} major programme of reconstruction, transforming the hall [...] "from a medium-sized Tudor house into a large Georgian manor". He built a new west wing, which contained a dining room, a drawing room, a library, and a ballroom, the last occupying the whole length of the first floor. [...] He then rebuilt the south wing, connecting it with the new west wing and the older Tudor east wing. At {{each end of the}} south wing was a pavilion with a canted bay on its south front. [...] The west pavilion contained {{the southern end of the}} ballroom, and the east pavilion housed a chapel. [...] During this time the stable block and other buildings were constructed in the grounds. [...] The architect responsible for this work is unknown, although it has been suggested that the design was by Charles himself. [...] A major reconstruction took place in 1928 under the direction of the architect Hubert Worthington. [...] Much of the west wing was demolished, removing the ballroom but retaining the drawing and dining rooms. [...] To avoid leaving a gap exposing the courtyard, Worthington <b>filled</b> <b>it</b> <b>with</b> a screen wall containing a corridor linking the west and south wings. [...] He decorated this with quoins, cornices and sash windows. [...] The projecting pavilions at the ends of the south front were also demolished. In the 1960s the stable block was converted into mews flats. [...] Between 2004 and 2009 the east wing was restored.|$|E
