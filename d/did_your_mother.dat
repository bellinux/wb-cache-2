6000|$|... "To {{think that}} I have found you at last, child. How puzzled you look. <b>Did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> never speak of me? How is she? Where is she?" ...|$|E
6000|$|His father laughed. [...] "Perhaps you did, Tom; {{perhaps you}} <b>did.</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> {{would have known}} you were leading up to something, but I'll confess that I didn't. What is it?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> <b>do</b> {{when she}} wants to do you justice?" [...] Rowland asked, observing the admirable line of the young girl's neck.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> mean," [...] stammered Lady Casterley, [...] "letting {{you grow}} up like this! You're as bad as she was at your age!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "However <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> {{manage to}} gain an entree into society?" [...] she asked. [...] "Your father was a poor man and of little account. I know, for he was my own brother." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I like that," [...] said Nan, presently, and {{her face}} looked less elfish, with its sharp eyes, {{inquisitive}} nose, and mischievous mouth. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> do {{to you when you}} ran away that time?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so glad we {{came this}} way," [...] said Anne, the shining-eyed. [...] "This is my adopted {{birthday}}, you know, and this garden and its {{story is the}} birthday gift it has given me. <b>Did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> ever tell you what Hester Gray looked like, Diana?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{does this}} mean? Why am I {{treated as if}} I had no {{business}} here? <b>Does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> want to insult me?" [...] asked Rebecca, angrily.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I am {{sure she}} is a very {{excellent}} girl,' said Aunt Jane warmly. 'But certainly {{it would have been better}} to have these lessons in our house. <b>Does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> know?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's thrue, dear," [...] said Matilda; [...] "but John Dolan's not so soft as to {{take any}} girl just as she stands. What <b>does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> say about the money part of the business?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He lives {{a little}} {{distance}} from the Grange,' I replied; 'just beyond those hills: not so far, but you may walk over here when you get hearty. And you should be glad to go home, and to see him. You must try to love him, as you <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother,</b> and then he will love you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh my dear child, 'spoiling it'!" [...] Vanderbank protested {{as he took}} a cup of {{tea from}} her to carry to their friend. [...] "When <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> ever spoil {{anything}}? I told her Mr. Longdon wanted to see you, but I didn't say anything of his not yearning also {{for the rest of the}} family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That word again!" [...] he cried. [...] "What part {{it plays}} {{in the life of}} the noblesse. All that it suits you to do, you do because honour bids you, all to which you have bound yourselves, but which is distasteful, you {{discover}} that honour forbids, and that you would be dishonoured did you persist. But I am interrupting you, Citoyenne. <b>Did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> advance any arguments?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "An effort? Do {{you call}} it an effort to fall away, to sink far down, to give up every effort? What <b>does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> say, heaven help her?" [...] Mr. Carteret went on before Nick could answer the other question.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah!' said Albinia, 'they have {{blackened}} {{your eyes}} like the bruises of material antagonists! Yes, it is a gallant battle, but indeed you must give yourself {{all the help}} you can, for it would be <b>doing</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> no good to fall ill.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{boy could}} not tell them much, even if he got there," [...] the other said; [...] "and from this {{distance}} it would need a sharp eye and some military knowledge to make out anything {{of what is going}} on. Where <b>does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> live, boy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{have paid}} the penalty!' he said sadly. 'Men of my sort always get {{the worst of}} it somehow. Though I never <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> any harm. Now, Avice--I'll call you dear Avice for your mother's sake and not for your own--I must see what I can do to help you out of the {{difficulty}} that unquestionably you are in. Why can't you love your husband now you have married him?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I can't help it, Dick," [...] she said, [...] "so {{it is of}} no {{use your}} scolding me. This is a surprise. Who {{would have thought of}} your coming back so soon? But it is lucky you <b>did.</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> has been in a sad way, and she was so sure that you had been in some terrible danger, that I have been almost as anxious as she has. And now, it seems that I need not have frightened myself at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Her skipper {{must be a}} lubber to {{have the}} ropes hanging about like that. Of course, {{he may have had}} bad weather in {{crossing}} the bay, but if he had any pride in the craft, he might at least have got her into a good deal better trim while coming in from the Needles. Still, all that could be remedied in an hour's work, and certainly she is as pretty a trader as ever I saw. How <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> seem this afternoon, Bertha?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah no," [...] I said. [...] "Remember that I am {{old enough}} to be your father; that I knew you when you were three years old. I may surely ask such questions. But you are right; one must <b>do</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> justice. She was {{certainly}} thinking of her second marriage." ...|$|R

6000|$|Henchard's {{wife was}} dissevered from him by death; {{his friend and}} helper Farfrae by estrangement; Elizabeth-Jane by ignorance. It {{seemed to him that}} only one of them could {{possibly}} be recalled, and that was the girl. His mind began vibrating between the wish to reveal himself to her and the policy of leaving well alone, till he could no longer sit still. He walked up and down, and then he came and stood behind her chair, looking down upon the top of her head. He could no longer restrain his impulse. [...] "What <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> tell you about me--my history?" [...] he asked.|$|E
60|$|He {{went off}} between the pines, and Van Brunt found himself staring into Thom's warm eyes. Five years, he mused, and she can't {{be more than}} twenty now. A most {{remarkable}} creature. Being Eskimo, she should have a little flat excuse for a nose, and lo, it is neither broad nor flat, but aquiline, with nostrils delicately and sensitively formed as any fine lady's of a whiter breed--the Indian strain somewhere, be assured, Avery Van Brunt. And, Avery Van Brunt, don't be nervous, she won't eat you; she's only a woman, and not a bad-looking one at that. Oriental rather than aborigine. Eyes large and fairly wide apart, with just the faintest hint of Mongol obliquity. Thom, you're an anomaly. You're out of place here among these Eskimos, even if your father is one. Where <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> come from? or your grandmother? And Thom, my dear, you're a beauty, a frigid, frozen little beauty with Alaskan lava in your blood, and please don't look at me that way.|$|E
6000|$|... "Stay a little, Ethel," [...] {{cried the}} Countess, with a {{trembling}} voice. [...] "I am older than your father, and {{you owe me}} a little obedience--that is, if children do owe any obedience to their parents nowadays. I don't know. I am an old woman--the world perhaps has changed since my time; and it is you who ought to command, I dare say, and we to follow. Perhaps I have been wrong all through life, and in trying to teach my children to do as I was made to do. God knows I have had very little comfort from them: whether they did or whether they didn't. You and Frank I had set my heart on; I loved you out of all my grandchildren--was it very unnatural that I should wish to see you together? For that boy I have been saving money these years past. He flies back to {{the arms of his}} mother, who has been pleased to hate me as only such virtuous people can; who took away my own son from me; and now his son--towards whom the only fault I ever committed was to spoil him and be too fond of him. Don't leave me too, my child. Let me have something that I can like at my years. And I like your pride, Ethel, and your beauty, my dear; and I am not angry with your hard words; and if I wish to see you in the place in life which becomes you--do I do wrong? No. Silly girl! There--give me the little hand. How hot it is! Mine is as cold as a stone--and shakes, doesn't it?--Eh! it was a pretty hand once! What did Anne--what <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> say to Frank's letter.|$|E
50|$|Originally the outro {{after the}} encore was a 5-minute {{instrumental}} medley (in {{the style of}} the Ouverture and Entr'Acte) featuring Gimme! Gimme! Gimme! (A Man After Midnight), SOS, Voulez-Vous, <b>Does</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Mother</b> Know, Money, Money, Money and Dancing Queen. It was later replaced with the short Dancing Queen instrumental, still being used today.|$|R
6000|$|The doctor {{rose and}} took up his hat; then he {{suddenly}} turned toward Miss Drane and said, [...] "La Fleur, our cook, came {{to speak to me}} this morning about <b>your</b> <b>mother.</b> She says she thinks that you are not well lodged; that the street is in the hottest part of the town, and that Mrs. Drane's health will suffer if you stay there. <b>Does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> object to <b>your</b> present quarters?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Wix {{took her}} up. [...] "He must lump it--that's {{what he must}} <b>do!</b> <b>Your</b> <b>mother</b> was right about him--I mean your real one. He has no strength. No--none at all." [...] She seemed more profoundly to muse. [...] "He might have had some even with HER--I mean with her ladyship. He's just a poor sunk slave," [...] she {{asserted}} with sudden energy.|$|R

[...] I talked about what degenerates they were and they proved me right.|$|E
5000|$|A certain young {{gentleman who}} had come to Rome from the provinces was found to bear an {{astonishing}} resemblance to Augustus Caesar. Hearing this, Augustus had the man brought before him. Perceiving the close resemblance, Augustus asked him, [...] "Tell me, <b>did</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> ever spend any time in Rome?" [...] The quick-witted provincial shot back, [...] "My mother, never; my father, often." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Fear, perchance of my brother--a mistaken fear, for Halbert would not, {{to ensure}} himself a kingdom, have offered wrong to an orphan; besides that, your title, in quiet times, even had <b>your</b> father <b>done</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> that justice which I well hope he did, {{could not have}} competed with that of my brother's wife, the child of Julian's elder brother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Pardon me then if I am rough. To me {{it seems}} that an injury is done {{to you if you}} are made to go to the house of such a one as this man. Why <b>does</b> <b>your</b> <b>mother</b> seek his society? Not because she likes him; not because she has any sympathy with him or his family;--but simply because there is a rich daughter.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're {{lucky to}} live in an age when you can <b>do</b> so. <b>Your</b> <b>mother,</b> for instance, couldn't. She had to do her {{thinking}} at home--under inspection." ...|$|R
