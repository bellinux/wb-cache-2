40|$|In {{the first}} essay we study commensurability {{property}} of the directional distance function (DDF). We find that a popular DDF with a fixed directional vector is neither absolute nor ranking commensurable. Nevertheless, this function can be commensurated if the directional vector is commensurated along with the data. We identify a necessary and sufficient condition for a vector that ensures commensurability of the DDF, which helps somewhat narrowing down the key issue for this function in practice—the choice of direction of measurement. In the second paper I test the performance of smooth homogeneous bootstrap bias-correction in multi-output frontier models using hyperbolic efficiency function. I propose an approxima¬tion procedure that substantially reduces the nonparametric estimation time while sacrificing little precision compared to the most precise nonparametric alternative. The performance of the uncorrected and bias-corrected estimates is tested in samples of different sizes via Monte Carlo simulation. All techniques perform well in large samples even without correction. Both parametric and nonparametric estimators benefit from the correction regardless of the sample size. Uncorrected nonparametric estimators perform well in large and require bias-correction in smaller samples. In the small samples bias correction shows marginally better results when applied to the parametric estimator. The final paper studies the effects of nontradeable <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> and transferable <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> systems on the accumulation of capital and output growth in small open economies. Both types of regulation impede the growth. The transferable <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> system has different effects {{on the development of}} quota buyers and quota sellers. While quota buyers enjoy faster growth in the both capital stock and output as compared to the nontransferable quota system, quota sellers face slower capital accumulation and economic growth. The simulation using advances in frontier modelling confirms the theoretical findings and reveals that developmental consequences for quota sellers range from a slower capital accumulation to capital stock shrinkage. It also suggests that quota sellers substitute economic production for quota revenues and economic output falls over time...|$|E
40|$|Efforts {{to limit}} climate change below a given {{temperature}} level require that global emissions of CO 2 cumulated over time remain below a limited quota. This quota varies depending on the temperature level, the desired probability of staying below this level and the contributions of other gases. In spite of this restriction, global emissions of CO 2 from fossil fuel combustion and cement production have continued to grow by 2. 5 % per year on average over the past decade. Two thirds of the CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> consistent with a 2 °C temperature limit has already been used, and the total quota will likely be exhausted in a further 30 years at the 2014 emissions rates. We show that CO 2 emissions track {{the high end of}} the latest generation of emissions scenarios, due to lower than anticipated carbon intensity improvements of emerging economies and higher global gross domestic product growth. In the absence of more stringent mitigation, these trends are set to continue and further reduce the remaining quota until the onset of a potential new climate agreement in 2020.

40|$|We {{characterize}} {{a mechanism}} for reducing pollution emissions in which countries,　acting non-cooperatively, commit to match each others’ abatement levels and may　subsequently engage in <b>emissions</b> <b>quota</b> trading. The mechanism leads to an efficient level of emissions, and if the matching abatements process includes a quota trading stage, the marginal benefits of emissions are also equalized across countries. Given equilibrium matching rates, the initial allocation of <b>emission</b> <b>quotas</b> (before trading) reflects each country’s marginal valuation for lower pollution relative to its marginal benefit from emissions. These results hold {{for any number of}} countries, in an environment where countries have different abatement technologies and different benefits from emissions, and even if the emissions of countries are imperfect substitutes in each country’s damage function. In a dynamic twoperiod setting, the mechanism achieves both intra-temporal and inter-temporal efficiency. We extend the model by assuming that countries are voluntarily contributing to an international public good, in addition to undertaking pollution abatements, and find that the level of emissions may be efficient even without any matching abatement commitments, and the marginal benefits of emissions may be equalized across countries even without quota trading.

40|$|Abstract niet beschikbaarThe {{feasibility}} {{of an effective}} international response to anticipated climate change {{is dependent on the}} recognition of the present and historical inequities between developing and industrialized countries. Developing countries should be enabled and supported to continue their development towards higher standards of living in a fashion that is consistent with the sustainability of the global biosphere. This paper evaluates long-term climate strategies by which the burden of mitigating climate change by controlling CO 2 -emissions is shared equitably. Here we use as a possible criterion of equity, that every human being, past or future, is allowed to emit the same carbon quotum on an annual basis. Using such an interpretation of interregional and intergenerational equity we calculate the 'emission debts' and future regional per capita <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> for the world-regions. The results show that past industrialisation has coincided with a large relative contribution of the rich regions to the rise in CO 2 -concentration, an estimated 40 % for the EC and North America, which have built up an emission debt of 36 GtC and 75 GtC resp. using recent World Bank projections of population growth. The developing countries, however, have built up an emission credit of 24 GtC. These regional emission debts and credits increase the future per capita budget for the developing regions till 0. 2 - 0. 8 ton C/cap yearly, whereas North America and the EC end up with negative future carbon budgets. Even if the IPCC Business-as-Usual scenario is considered as reference, the future <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> of most industrialized countries are lower than their present per capita emissions...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{consider}} an {{international emissions trading}} scheme with partial sectoral and regional coverage. Sectoral and regional expansion of the trading scheme is beneficial in aggregate, but not necessarily for individual countries. We simulate international CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>quota</b> markets using marginal abatement cost functions and the Copenhagen 2020 climate policy targets for selected countries that strategically allocate emissions {{in a bid to}} manipulate the quota price. Quota exporters and importers generally have conflicting interests about admitting more countries to the trading coalition, and our results indicate that some countries may lose substantially when the coalition expands in terms of new countries. For a given coalition, expanding sectoral coverage makes most countries better off, but some countries (notably the USA and Russia) may lose out due to loss of strategic advantages. In general, exporters tend to have stronger strategic power than importers. Keywords: Emissions Trading; Allocation of Quotas; Strategic Behavio...|$|E

40|$|This paper uses {{analytical}} and numerical general equilibrium models {{to study the}} costs of achieving pollution reductions under a range of environmental policy instruments in a second-best setting with pre-existing factor taxes. We compare the costs and efficiency impacts of <b>emissions</b> taxes, <b>emissions</b> <b>quotas,</b> fuels taxes, performance standards, and mandated technologies, and explore how costs change with the magnitude of pre-existing taxes {{and the extent of}} pollution abatement. We find that the presence of distortionary taxes raises the costs of pollution abatement under each instrument relative to its costs in a first-best world. This extra cost is an increasing function of the magnitude of pre-existing tax rates. For plausible values of pre-existing tax rates and other parameters, the cost increase for all policies is substantial (35 % or more). The impact of pre-existing taxes is large for non-auctioned <b>emissions</b> <b>quotas,</b> the cost increase can be several hundred percent. Earlier work on instrument choice emphasized the potential reduction in compliance cost from converting fixed <b>emissions</b> <b>quotas</b> into tradeable <b>emissions</b> permits. Our results show the regulator's decision to auction or grandfather emissions rights can have important cost impacts. Similarly, the choice of how to recycle revenues from environmentally motivated taxes can be as important to cost as whether the tax takes the form of an emissions tax or fuel tax, particularly when modest emissions reductions are involved. In both first- and second-best settings, the cost differences across instruments depend on the extent of pollution abatement under consideration. Total abatement costs differ markedly at low levels of abatement. Strikingly, for all instruments except the fuel tax these costs converge to the same value as abatement levels approach 100 percent. ...|$|R

The total amount of quotas to be distributed in each period corresponds to the total optimal amount of emissions to be realised at each period. We observe that the "equitable" quotas allocation rules the most often referred to are not acceptable by every country at every period: some of them would be better off by not co-operating.
