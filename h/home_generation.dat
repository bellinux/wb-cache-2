We showed that policy instruments to reduce energy costs could be important as drivers for those systems diffusions. And we also showed that competitive and innovative environment to encourage energy companies and manufacturers to develop and sell the high-value-added systems...|$|E

We studied the {{association}} of language spoken at <b>home,</b> <b>generation</b> and birth place with kidney function among Hispanics and Chinese in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 2999). Kidney function was deter-mined by cystatin C (eGFRcys) and albumin/creatinine ratio (ACR). We evaluated mediators in models: Model 1 = age, sex, income, education; Model 2 =Model 1 + beha-viors; and Model 3 = Model 1 + comorbidities. Results. Among Hispanics, speaking mixed Spanish/ English was significantly associated with lower eGFRcys (− 2. 83 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2, − 5. 69 – 0. 04) and higher ACR (RD 40 %, 17 – 68 %) compared with speaking Spanish only; this was mildly attenuated by behaviors (− 2. 29, − 5. 33 – 0. 75; RD 42 %, 18 – 72 %) but not comorbidities (− 3. 04, − 5. 83 to − 0. 23); RD 35 %, 14 – 59 %).

METHODS: We studied the {{association}} of language spoken at <b>home,</b> <b>generation</b> and birth place with kidney function among Hispanics and Chinese in the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis (n = 2999).

We evaluated mediators in models: Model 1 = age, sex, income, education; Model 2 = Model 1 + behaviors; and Model 3 = Model 1 + comorbidities. RESULTS: Among Hispanics, speaking mixed Spanish/English was significantly associated with lower eGFRcys (-[*] 2. 83 mL/min/ 1. 73 m(2), -[*] 5. 69 - 0. 04) and higher ACR (RD 40 %, 17 - 68 %) compared with speaking Spanish only; this was mildly attenuated by behaviors (-[*] 2. 29, -[*] 5. 33 - 0. 75; RD 42 %, 18 - 72 %) but not comorbidities (-[*] 3. 04, -[*] 5. 83 to -[*] 0. 23); RD 35 %, 14 - 59 %).

In contrast, Chinese who spoke any English had higher eGFRcys (2. 53, 95 % CI: -[*] 1. 70 - 6. 78), but similar ACR (RD -[*] 5 %, 95 % CI: -[*] 26 - 23 %) compared with those speaking Chinese only, but associations were not statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Higher acculturation was associated with worse kidney function in Hispanics, mediated perhaps by behavioral factors but not comorbidities. Associations may be in the opposite direction among Chinese. Future studies are needed to elucidate these mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the lives of people living in a social housing estate which was a joint venture between the Housing Association of South Africa (HASA), a Netherlands based {{foundation}} and the Buffalo City Municipality. This type of social housing estate is a relatively new concept in post-apartheid South Africa and a first for the City of East London. Apartheid spawned the separation of different groups of people into racial enclaves. It also created barriers between races, advantaged certain races over others and created fear, hatred and general distrust among different racial groups in South Africa. The dislocation of apartheid was accompanied by rapid urbanization and ‘reconstruction’ of infrastructure and inter-racial relationships. The opening up of the country’s borders in compliance with Globalisation made South Africa a melting pot to people of different cultures. South African cities became fragmented and fear and strangeness was everywhere. Housing or the lack of it has been a constant problem that the new post apartheid government has grappled with. The solution of building RDP housing estates has not solved this burgeoning problem. But even more importantly it has failed to reorganize urban life in South Africa. In approaching this study I look at how these new social housing estates have reorganized urban life. I explore the concepts of community, <b>home,</b> <b>generation,</b> gender, material culture and ‘new’ urbanization to provide a framework for my study. This study is a qualitative study based in the city of East London in the Eastern Cape. It is a community study which attempts to go inside the home to unlock some of the intricacies of urban life. Ethnography is the research key used to unlock these intricacies. In conclusion, this study attempts to examine a non-western narrative of community life. Are these housing estates a solution to South Africa’s housing problem? Do they conform only to western narratives of urban life? What kind of citizens do these housing estates produce? These are some of the questions that this study hopes to answer...|$|E
40|$|To {{achieve the}} goals of German energy {{transition}} especially in renewable energy shares, the smart grid will {{play a key role}} in managing the demand able to match more volatile supply and optimizing the entire electricity system. Even though the system transformation is technically feasible, the successful transition cannot live without end users willing to transform their way of using energy. This thesis has explored possible roles of individual consumers in the smart grid implementation and in detail analyzed their influential factors. An online survey was conducted to capture preferences and behaviors of energy consumers during the time period of November 2013 to January 2014. The three roles of private electricity consumers - as consumers consuming electricity through appliances, as citizens holding attitudes towards smart grid applications, and as potential producers of electricity - are targeted. Constructs from the theory of planned behavior were tested by using a sample of 517 German citizens. Structural equation models of individual’s electricity saving behavior, their intention to participate in smart grid applications and investment behavior in solar panels were built. It was found that determinants of attitude, perceived norm, and perceived behavioral control together explain 32 %- 56 % of the variance in the three behaviors. Attitude was found to be the most influential factor of individual electricity saving behavior, as well as of citizens’ intentions to participate in smart grid applications. For solar panel investment, it is perceived behavioral control that has the highest impact on the behavior. As the smart grid concept is not well understood by common people, education program and information campaigns are needed, in which social norm marketing is worth more attention, ascribable to the considerable impact caused by the diffusion of norms through social networks. To examine this social influence effect, empirically founded agent-based models for the above-mentioned three behaviors were created to estimate possible behavior changes brought by social norms at the aggregate level. Simulation results show that a reduction of total consumptions by 20 % could be achieved in the virtual community due to behavior conformity induced by identified adopters. The potential impact of social norms on <b>home</b> <b>generation</b> and load shift are also promising...|$|E
