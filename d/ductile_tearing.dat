50|$|SAC solders have {{outperformed}} high-Pb solders C4 joints in ceramic ball {{grid array}} (CBGA) systems, which are ball-grid arrays with a ceramic substrate. The CBGA showed consistently better results in thermal cycling for Pb-free alloys. The findings also show that SAC alloys are proportionately better in thermal fatigue as the thermal cycling range decreases. SAC performs better than Sn-Pb at the less extreme cycling conditions.Another advantage of SAC is that {{it appears to be}} more resistant to gold embrittlement than Sn-Pb. In test results, the strength of the joints is substantially higher for the SAC alloys than the Sn-Pb alloy. Also, the failure mode is changed from a partially brittle joint separation to a <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> with the SAC.|$|E
50|$|For {{cases where}} the plastic energy at the crack tip is not negligible, other {{fracture}} mechanics parameters, such as the J integral or R-curve, {{can be used to}} characterize a material. The toughness data produced by these other tests will be dependent on the thickness of the product tested and will not be a true material property. However, plane-strain conditions do not exist in all structural configurations and using KIC values in the design of relatively thin areas may result in excess conservatism and a weight or cost penalty. In {{cases where the}} actual stress state is plane-stress or, more generally, some intermediate- or transitional-stress state, it is more appropriate to use J integral or R-curve data, which account for slow, stable fracture (<b>ductile</b> <b>tearing)</b> rather than rapid (brittle) fracture.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAccurate {{prediction}} of crack-driving force equations {{is important in}} any pipeline fracture assessment program. In highly ductile materials, such as pipeline steel, {{a considerable amount of}} stable crack growth can be tolerated before the failure of the structure. The existing methods use simplified analytical procedures to account for <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing,</b> and they often result in conservative critical crack sizes. Further, none of the published numerical tools for modelling crack growth is suitable for engineering applications. This work describes a simple method for simulating through-thickness <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> in surface cracked pipes, using line-spring finite elements. The crack growth resistance curve is used to advance the crack front. The line-spring results are verified using crack growth simulations employing the Gurson damage model. Finally, a detailed parametric study is carried out to examine the effect of <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> on crack driving force relationships in circumferentially surface cracked pipes. The results demonstrate that considering <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> is important in fracture assessment procedures for pipelines...|$|E

Experimental results of seven groups of different strength alloy steels show that bothì and Jì values of <b>ductile</b> <b>tear</b> from the shallow crack specimens which have less constraint flow field are significantly higher than deeply notched specimens. Slip- line- field analysis shows that, for shallow crack, the hydrostatic stress is lower than that from standard deeply cracked bend specimen, which develops {{a high level of}} crack tip constraint, provides a lower bound estimate of toughness, will ensure an unduly conservative approach when applied to structural defects, especially if initiation values of COD and J-integral are used...|$|R

Mg alloy was prepared with metal model casting method and subsequently hot extruded at 703  K with the reduction ratio of 101 : 1. The grains were dynamically recrystallized after the extrusion process. Moreover, the (0002) pole figure of Mg–Mn–Ce alloy developed a splitting of pronounced basal texture. The mechanical properties were different due to different angles between c-axis and loading direction (0 °, 45 ° and 90 °) in the tensile tests. This significantly induces an asymmetry in the yield behavior. The Mg–Mn–Ce alloy exhibits a classical dimple structure {{as a result of}} slip accumulation and <b>ductile</b> <b>tear...</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstrac t. The {{fracture}} resistance of ferritic steels in the ductilelbrittle transition regime {{is controlled by}} the competition between <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> and cleavage fracture. Under typical conditions, a crack initiates and grows by <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> but ultimate failure occurs by catastrophic cleavage fracture. In this paper the tearing process is simulated using void-containing cell elements embedded within a conventional elastic-plastic continuum. Weakest link statistics is incorporated into the cell element model and this new model is employed to predict the onset of unstable cleavage fracture. Load-displacement behavior, <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> resistance and transition to cleavage fracture are investigated for three different test geometries. The model predicts trends in ductilelbrittle transition that are consistent with experimental data. 1...|$|E

Attention has been focussed on the behaviour of re-entrant sectors which form from coalescing fatigue cracks. Fatigue studies and numerical modelling shows that such sectors exhibit enhanced values of the stress intensity factor. The line spring technique was used to analyse a series of evolving configurations, which originate from the {{interaction of}} two adjacent semi-elliptical cracks, as shown in Figure 1. Under elastic-plastic conditions amplified values of J-integral {{were found in the}} re-entrant sectors, which also exhibit loss of crack tip constraint, as parameterised by T. Numerical work is compared with <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> experiments performed on a plain carbon-manganese steel. The experiments show that <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> initiates from the re-entrant sector and the crack develops towards a bounding shape, as shown in Figure 2.

40|$|Abstract. The {{effect of}} plastic {{constraint}} on {{the initiation of}} <b>ductile</b> <b>tears</b> has been studied by measuring the J-integral and COD at initiation in three-point bend specimens with deep and shallow notches. Experimental results of 30 groups of steels show that both id and iJ values increase with decreasing a/W when a/W? 0. 3 and that shallow crack specimens which have less constrained flow field give markedly higher values of toughness than deeply notched specimens. However, for a/W? 0. 3, the toughness {{was found to be}} independent of a/W. Slip-line-field analysis explains the result and the theoretical development of Two Parameter Fracture Mechanics also rationalized our experimental results. The advantage of enhanced toughness for specimens with low levels of constraint should be taken into account for defect assessment, and a modified reasonable result should be taken for engineering applications...|$|R
40|$|Tearing a {{thin sheet}} by forcing a rigid object through {{it leads to}} complex crack morphologies; a single oscillatory crack arises when a tool is driven {{laterally}} through a brittle sheet, while two diverging cracks {{and a series of}} concertina-like folds forms when a tool is forced laterally through a ductile sheet. On the other hand, forcing an object perpendicularly through the sheet leads to radial petal-like <b>tears</b> in both <b>ductile</b> and brittle materials. To understand these different regimes we use a combination of experiments, simulations and simple theories. In particular, we describe the transition from brittle oscillatory tearing via a single crack to <b>ductile</b> concertina <b>tearing</b> with two tears by deriving laws that describe the crack paths and wavelength of the concertina folds and provide a simple phase diagram for the morphologies in terms of the material properties of the sheet and the relative size of the tool.

40|$|This paper uses X-ray {{computed}} tomography {{to track the}} mechanical response of a vertebrate (Barnacle goose) long bone subjected to an axial compressive load, which is increased gradually until failure. A loading rig was mounted in an X-ray {{computed tomography}} system so that a time-lapse sequence of three-dimensional (3 D) images of the bone’s internal (cancellous or trabecular) structure could be recorded during loading. Five distinct types of deformation mechanism were observed in the cancellous part of the bone. These were (i) cracking, (ii) thinning (iii) tearing of cell walls and struts, (iv) notch formation, (v) necking and (vi) buckling. The results highlight that bone experiences brittle (notch formation and cracking), <b>ductile</b> (thinning, <b>tearing</b> and necking) and elastic (buckling) modes of deformation. Progressive deformation, leading to cracking was studied in detail using digital image correlation. The resulting strain maps were consistent with mechanisms occurring at a finer-length scale. This paper {{is the first to}} capture time-lapse 3 D images of a whole long bone subject to loading until failure. The results serve as a unique reference for researchers interested in how bone responds to loading. For those using computer modelling, the study not only provides qualitative information for verification and validation of their simulations but also highlights that constitutive models for bone need to take into account a number of different deformation mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Plastic tearing {{occurs in}} compact tension (C(T)) {{specimens}} fabricated from <b>ductile</b> steels. This <b>tearing,</b> however, {{is not an}} elastic fracture problem governed by a crack tip singularity parameter. The current application of the J-integral and the J-R curve to plastic fracture mechanics is misleading. This dissertation reviews the existing energy rate and geometric factor approaches, and then reanalyzes the unloading compliance data for C(T) specimens of various types of steel. The objective of the analysis is to investigate the criteria that can characterize the crack extension under plastic tearing. The author suggests that the energy release rate that remains constant with significant crack growth, {{in conjunction with the}} mechanism motion of crack extension to represent the degree of tearing, can serve as the objective parameter in a standard fracture toughness test. Both the energy release rate and the plastic tearing mechanism motion are calculated directly from the test data. The effects of the initial crack length, the specimen size, the testing temperature, and the steel type on the results are investigated. The purpose is to determine the sensitivity of both parameters to the testing configurations. To discuss the tri-axial stress status ahead of the crack front, a finite element model using non-singular elements is presented and verified by the experimental load-displacement curve. Simplifications to the costly C(T) specimen fabrication are proposed based on the analytical conclusions from both the test data and the finite element model...|$|R

40|$|Recent studies {{indicate}} that the onset of stable <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> leads to crack-tip fields ahead of the growing crack and crack-tip profiles that {{differ from those of}} a stationary crack.

Also, measured cleavage fracture toughness values for these specimens will be influenced by changes in crack-tip constraint conditions that occur with prior stable crack growth. Fracture analysis techniques for inclusion of ductile crack growth in finite-element analyses were evaluated through applications to a full-thickness clad beam specimen containing a shallow crack in material for which metallurgical conditions are prototypic of those found in reactor pressure vessels (RPVs) at beginning of life. The beam specimen, which experienced a significant amount of precleavage stable <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing,</b> was fabricated from a section of an RPV wall (removed from a canceled nuclear plant) that includes weld, plate, and clad material.

40|$|Margins in defect {{assessment}} procedures such as BS 7910 and R 6 / 4 {{have been examined}} for cleavage and <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> from complex and re-characterised defects. A range of crack profiles with re-entrant sectors developed from two co-planar surface breaking defects by fatigue has been examined experimentally and numerically. Both studies show enhanced crack driving forces in the re-entrant sector combined {{with a loss of}} crack tip constraint. Cleavage failures from complex and re-characterised defects demonstrated that the re-characterisation procedure is not conservative when cleavage occurs at small fractions of the limit load. Failures close to the limit load benefit from constraint loss which counteract the amplified crack driving forces in re-entrant sectors and cause re-characterised defects to be more detrimental than the original complex defects. Benefit may be taken from statistical size effects, which are strongly dependent on the crack geometry. Experimental fatigue and <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing</b> studies show similar development of complex cracks towards the re-characterised shape and re-characterisation procedures, such as those given in BS 7910 and R 6 / 4, are conservative for fatigue and <b>ductile</b> <b>tearing.</b> A procedure has been developed to quantify enhanced temperature margins due to constraint loss by comparing the self similar stress fields at a critical local fracture stress (the Ritchie-Knott-Rice approach) and through the Weibull stress. Agreement with the experimental data has been demonstrated and the temperature dependence of the material parameters has been discussed. Following Li (1997) and Karstensen (1996), a toughness mapping technique was discussed that allows mode I toughness to be translated into mixed-mode I+II toughness for stress controlled fracture.
