40|$|Rural {{development}} in the European Union has to face several challenges. Negative effects {{of old and new}} challenges (if these challenges are not faced effectively) might enhance and accelerate those processes that are taking place slowly for the present but that are definitely irreversible. On the basis of sector-specific approach problems related to agriculture should be focused on. It has to be, however, highlighted that there is an ongoing paradigm change: there is a shift from the agricultural policy aiming at food self sufficiency and income parity towards a sustainable rural policy with spatial focus. The shift itself is considered a continuous challenge, too. The following questions as objectives of the paper arise: - Are there policy instruments that could accelerate the paradigm change, enhance the spread of ―new rural economies‖? - What is the relation between the priorities of the rural {{development in}} the European Union and the spatial (or territorial) approach? - Is there a way to create such an agricultural policy which itself is able to face more effectively the new rural challenges? - At which level should be found the solutions to problems including finding the necessary financial resources – national or Community level? In what way could be reallocated the necessary resources of an integrated rural policy? The paper intends to analyze and systematize the challenges facing the rural economy/rural development both {{from the point of view}} of sectoral and territorial approach. It is aimed at analyzing and assessing adequate policy instruments and justified financial tools which could strengthen the integrated rural policy.

We want to bring up our children in a healthy environment, and demand that our workplace is safe and hygienic. When travelling within the European Union, we need access to reliable and high-quality health advice and assistance. The Member States {{have a responsibility to}} ensure that these concerns are reflected in their policies, but, although the EU doesn't usually intend to make health policy but in practice other policies often to do with the union's origins as a free market affect health care. Thus, the EU complements the national health policies and has a vital role to play through the obligations placed on it by the European Treaties, bringing <b>European</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> through its action to the EU sustainable development strategy.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of the paper is to stimulate the research processes focusing on the measure of <b>European</b> <b>added</b> <b>value</b> (EAV).

It has been stressed that there are no possibilities to adapt such macro- and micro-economic models like: CBA, ENPV, RAEM, Trans-Tools or NEAC to measure EAV. As a result, within the further research only the dedicated economic and statistical analysis as well methods for measuring the quality and value of logistics processes may be efficiently used...|$|E

We also find that member states are already pursuing different strategies in dealing with these challenges. This creates risks for a European energy policy fragmentation.

40|$|Rural {{development}} in the European Union has to face several challenges such as increasing international competition among agricultural markets; growing needs for rural services (multifunctional agriculture); Eastern enlargement: increase in number and area of distressed regions and growing disparities; ageing, limited Community budget; unsustainability of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP). Furthermore, among the so-called new challenges the climate change and water management (floods and droughts) need {{to be dealt with}} both on sectoral basis and interdisciplinary, in an integrated way.
