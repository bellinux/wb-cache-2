Writing about the subdued concert in Dubai due to religious sentiments, Mohammed Kadry from Khaleej Times noted that Gaga could still put on a [...] "spectacle" [...] and she [...] "was determined to connect with her local audience as she attempted to piece together flattering colloquial phrases". Debra Kamin from The Times of Israel praised Gaga's vocals, adding that [...] "show was everything Gaga promised and everything fans <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from her — loud, , sexually explicit and mind-numbingly bright." ...|$|E

500|$|Rolling Stone {{reviewer}} David Fricke said [...] "Phil Collins' sudden {{transformation from}} the balding bantam drummer for a prosperous British art-rock group into a mainstream pop heartthrob might seem {{one of the}} Eighties' most improbable success stories. But judging from the sly craft and warm, low-key humour of his solo records and his successful productions for Philip Bailey and Frida, Collins' newfound fame was inevitable." [...] Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times originally disliked the song [...] "One More Night", but later praised the song, saying that [...] "Collins' soulful but polite vocal style is also capable of capturing the pain of going through yet one more night without her." [...] The Dallas Morning News writer Lennox Samuels said that [...] "No Jacket Required (Atlantic) is what fans <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from Phil Collins—lots of horns and syncopation, heavy rhythm." ...|$|E

Chrysta Cherrie, writing for Allmusic, gave the album a positive {{three and a half}} stars out of five and credited the album for its maturity and progression from the band from their debut, saying: [...] "Wildlife is the best of both worlds, serving up the energy and power fans <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from La Dispute, but showing a maturity beyond the band’s years." [...] Joshua Khan on Blare Magazine gave the album a 4.5 out of 5 star rating, describing the album's four monologues as [...] "tormented progressive rock outbursts" [...] and describes the instrumentation as bringing character to the vocals and lyrics.|$|E
500|$|Few {{details were}} {{revealed}} about the game's plot. In a January 2004 interview, lead designer Michael Stemmle provided a rough outline: the game's story was [...] "really six stories, loosely {{held together by}} a thrilling über-plot". Each individual story contained a separate case for the Freelance Police, taking place {{in a variety of}} environments, including a space station and a neopagan bacchanal, and featuring [...] "freakish bad guys". Stemmle stated that the intention was to keep the [...] "über-plot" [...] concealed for a while, but noted that it contained [...] "all the barely plausible grandeur that fans <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from Sam and Max". Steve Purcell, the creator of Sam & Max, assisted in the development of both the plot and the artistic direction, producing concept art of various characters and locales. Besides the return of the title characters, only one other character, Flint Paper, was confirmed for the game. Described by Stemmle as [...] "the Freelance Police's rough 'n' tumble private detective neighbour", Paper is briefly featured in Sam & Max comics and makes an offstage appearance in Sam & Max Hit the Road. Stemmle had Paper planned for a [...] "critical role" [...] in the game's plot.|$|E

5000|$|The song [...] "Your Autumn Eyes", {{which was}} {{released}} {{as a single}} {{during the summer of}} 1987 (the same version which appears on the album), was quite a departure for the band—a melancholy waltz-time ballad with an intense bridge/guitar solo. Most {{of the rest of the}} album, however, was what fans <b>had</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from the band.|$|R
500|$|The A.V. Club's Chris Martins {{praised the}} album, stating that [...] "perhaps most {{impressive}} is that Tyler, The Creator takes a noticeable step {{back so that}} his friends can enjoy the spotlight. When he does show up—standouts include the hulking G-funk mutation “Hcapd” and the grungy, bass-addled “P”—both his beats and raps thrill: All of the twisted jokes, tough introspection, and rabble-rousing that fans <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect,</b> {{with none of the}} unfortunate rape references his detractors rightly called him on." [...] Allmusic's David Jeffries called album closer [...] "Oldie" [...] epic in nature, stating that Earl Sweatshirt's return was the highlight of the album, summarizing the album as [...] "hype warranted." [...] Beats Per Minute's Craig Jenkin compared the album extensively to prior Odd Future releases, reporting that [...] "it ditches the expansive ooze that made stretches of Tyler’s Goblin a chore, the nihilistic agitprop of MellowHype’s BlackenedWhite, and the lackadaisical drugginess of Mike G’s Ali and Domo’s Rolling Papers in favor of the kind of restless, jerky energy that skyrocketed Bastard into the dialogue months prior." [...] He described the album as something that [...] "mainly sounds like a bunch of dudes in a dank basement cooking up the wildest smack talk possible, with one-upping each other being the primary objective." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode's humour {{was praised}} by the {{majority}} of commentators. Julia Raeside, writing for The Guardian, said the writers [...] "managed to pull together a loving tribute to [...] cult horror source material with an all-out gag rate that most sitcoms would fail to keep up with", claiming that [...] "they get the look and tone just right and then inject it with the kind of comedy that is perfectly tailored to puncture the fictional world without deflating it". Similarly, Debnath felt that the jokes, including [...] "anachronistic references" [...] and [...] "dark punnery", were [...] "bang on". By contrast, Hawksley claimed that the episode had several [...] "inspired moments", including a [...] "perfectly pitched" [...] joke about selfies, but that the writers had failed to properly exploit the 17th-century setting. Overall, though finding it [...] "occasionally funny", Hawksley thought the episode [...] "fell some way short of what we <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from Pemberton and Shearsmith". For the comedy critic Bruce Dessau, the episode was [...] "all the more hauntingly funny because it is played pretty straight", but he noted that the character of Sir Andrew Pike allowed [...] "some offbeat humour". Chater called the episode [...] "very, very funny", and Philip Cunnington, of the Lancashire Evening Post, called it [...] "one of the funniest half-hours of TV so far this year" [...] after the conclusion of the series.|$|E
500|$|... "The World Is Not Enough" [...] {{received}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Kerrang! magazine noted that [...] "Nothing takes a band into the truly immortal like a Bond theme, and Garbage's ever-burgeoning celebrity {{will be done}} no harm whatsoever by this appropriately lush and orchestral anthem." [...] A Radio Times reviewer wrote that the song [...] "sounds like Shirley Bassey revisited", while AllMusic's Steve Thomas Erlewine wrote that Garbage [...] "expertly modernized the classic Bond sound, while turning in a strong melodic tune. A first class theme song". PopMatters called the song a [...] "top-notch Bond theme", following the Shirley Bassey template. In a Billboard review, Chuck Taylor wrote that Garbage was an inspired choice and the song [...] "rings of international intrigue, with the slinky gait, noir-ish guitar line and grand chorus we <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect...</b> the song's darkly sexy, electronic ambience is wholly in keeping with Garbage's distinctive soundprint. [...] not only the best 007 theme in eons, {{it is a great}} Garbage track that should thrill fans of band and Bond alike". IGN ranked [...] "The World Is Not Enough" [...] ninth on its list of top 10 James Bond songs: [...] "Shirley Manson's warbling croon is a perfect fit for an opening sequence and her bandmates gel well with Arnold's sweeping symphonics." ...|$|E

500|$|Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter {{said the}} film [...] "takes the bold (for Marvel) step of {{reducing}} CGI spectacle to a relative minimum {{in favor of}} reviving the pleasures of hard-driving old-school action, surprising character development and intriguing suspense." [...] Scott Foundas of Variety said it is [...] "chockfull of the breathless cliffhangers dictated by the genre, but equally rich in the quiet, tender character moments that made the first film unique among recent Marvel fare." [...] Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times said, [...] "While not {{on a par with}} The Avengers or the first and third Iron Man movies, this is another rock-solid chapter in the big-screen story of Marvel." [...] Owen Gleiberman of Entertainment Weekly noted the topicality of the film, stating, [...] "Captain America: The Winter Soldier is the first superhero film since the terrorist-inflected The Dark Knight that plugs you right into what's happening now." [...] Ty Burr of The Boston Globe said the film [...] "delivers all the 3D CGI mayhem audiences <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> from the Marvel entertainment juggernaut, but there’s darkness and confusion just under its comic-book surface." [...] Joe Morgenstern of The Wall Street Journal said, [...] "What makes The Winter Soldier so enjoyable, and what will make it so profitable, is its emotional bandwidth—all the vivid, nuanced life lived by its characters in between their frenzied escapades," [...] and felt it fixed all the shortcomings of The First Avenger [...] "and then some".|$|E

[...] Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter praised the film as [...] "A mostly winning return for childhood favorites from a prior century [...] looks to accomplish its goal of pleasing old fans and winning new ones." [...] Alonso Duralde of The Wrap agreed writing that, [...] "The Muppets has the same brilliant absurdity, anarchic humor, subtle uplift and ensemble comedy that fans <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>expect</b> over the years."

2500|$|To trigger these {{sounds in}} real-time, Lee uses MIDI controllers, {{placed at the}} {{locations}} on the stage where he has a microphone stand. Lee uses two types of MIDI controllers: one type resembles a traditional synthesizer keyboard on a stand (Yamaha KX76). The second type is a large foot-pedal keyboard, placed on the stage floor (Korg MPK-130, Roland PK-5). Combined, they enable Lee to use his free hands and feet to trigger sounds in electronic equipment that has been placed off-stage.

Ordeal By Innocence slips out of that cheerful arena into something much too like an attempt at psychological fiction. It is too much of a conversation piece and too many people are talking – people in whom it is hard to take the necessary amount of interest because there is not enough space to establish them. The kind of workmanship which has been lavished on this tale is not a kind in which the author excels and the reader feels that Miss Marple and Poirot would thoroughly disapprove of the whole business." ...|$|E
