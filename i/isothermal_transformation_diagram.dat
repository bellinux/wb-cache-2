50|$|Isothermal {{transformation}} diagrams (also {{known as}} time-temperature-transformation (TTT) diagrams) are plots of temperature versus time (usually on a logarithmic scale). They are generated from percentage transformation-vs time measurements, and {{are useful for}} understanding the transformations of an alloy steel at elevated temperatures. An <b>isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>diagram</b> is only valid for one specific composition of material, and only if the temperature is held constant during the transformation, and strictly with rapid cooling to that temperature. Though usually used to represent transformation kinetics for steels, they {{also can be used}} to describe the kinetics of crystallization in ceramic or other materials. Time-temperature-precipitation diagrams and time-temperature-embrittlement diagrams have also been used to represent kinetic changes in steels.|$|E

40|$|Quenching and {{tempering}} {{of precision}} forged components using their forging heat leads to reduced process energy and shortens the usual process chains.

An algorithm based on the hardenability work of Kirkaldy and coworkers has been modified to fit the resistance welded high carbon plain carbon steel bars. <b>Isothermal</b> <b>transformation</b> <b>diagrams</b> were also computed.

Investigations were performed on 120 MnCrMoV 8 - 6 - 4 - 2 steel. Design/methodology/approach: Samples taken from investigated steel were austenitized at the temperature of 900 ºC and hardened in oil. Austenitizing time was 20 minutes. After that, seven of eight samples were tempered. Tempering consisted of holding the samples at 200 °C for defined periods.
