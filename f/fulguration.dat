Patients and methods: We used the MicroPerc™ system for stone clearance in three ureteric calculi, two bladder calculi, one case of urethral calculus, for antegrade biopsy {{in a case of}} upper tract urothelial carcinoma, for Deflux® (dextranomer/hyaluronic copolymer, Salix Pharmaceuticals, Uppsala, Sweden) injection in three cases of vesico-ureteric reflux (VUR), and three cases of posterior urethral valve (PUV) <b>fulgurations.</b> A 4. 85 -F ‘All-Seeing Needle®’ (PolyDiagnost) was used in most of the cases. An 8 -F mini-micro sheath was used where stability was deemed necessary. Clinical data were collected in a dedicated database. Intraoperative variables, postoperative complications, and outcomes were assessed. Results: All patients were successfully treated with complete stone clearance at 1  month with no residual fragments. The antegrade biopsy confirmed a high-grade papillary neoplasm. There were no technical difficulties with injection of Deflux or PUV <b>fulgurations.</b> Follow-up at 1  year revealed no stone recurrence, resolved reflux in all three cases, and all the children that had had PUVs were voiding well. The small sample and retrospective nature of the analysis are the limitations of this study. Conclusion: MicroPerc™, besides its usual use for minimally invasive percutaneous nephrolithotomy, can also be feasibly used for ureteric, bladder and urethral stones, and for treating non-calculus diseases such as PUVs and VUR.

Results: In total, 27 patients with PBS/IC in whom conservative treatments had failed were enrolled. Two months after <b>fulguration,</b> decreases were observed in the mean 24 -hour urinary frequency (from 16. 0 to 10. 2), 24 -hour urgency episodes (8. 0 to 1. 8), and the VAS (5. 8 to 1. 2), PUF symptom (15. 1 to 7. 0), PUF bother (8. 4 to 2. 7), OS symptom (15. 1 to 7. 2), and OS problem (13. 8 to 6. 0) scores.

Materials and Methods: A total of 217 children, managed for PUVs {{during a period of}} 6 years in a single surgical unit were prospectively studied. The ratio of the diameters of the prostatic and bulbar urethras (PU/BU) was calculated on the pre- and post-fulguration MCUG films.

Results: Group A: Of the 133 patients, 131 had normal urinary stream and 4 (3 &#x 0025;) had nocturnal enuresis. Vesicoureteral reflux (VUR), initially seen in 83 units (31 &#x 0025; units), regressed completely at a mean duration of 6 months in 41 units (49 &#x 0025;). Of the 152 non-VUR, hydroureteronephrosis (HUN) units, 11 were poorly functioning kidneys. Persistent slow but unobstructed drainage was seen in 23 units (16 &#x 0025;) over a period of 1. 5 - 5 years (mean 2. 5 years). Group B: All the 11 patients had a normal stream. Four (36. 4 &#x 0025;) had daytime frequency for a mean duration of 1 year and one (9 &#x 0025;) had nocturnal enuresis for 1 year. Grade IV-V VUR was seen in five patients (three bilateral), which regressed completely by 3 months in five units (62. 5 &#x 0025;). In the non-VUR, HUN patients, slow (but unobstructed) drainage was persistent in two units (14 &#x 0025;) at 3 years. Group C: Of the 16 patients, only 5 (31. 3 &#x 0025;) were asymptomatic. Six patients (nine units) had persistent VUR for 6 months to 3 years. Of the 20 units with HUN, 17 (85 &#x 0025;) were persistent at 1 - 4 years (mean 2 years).
