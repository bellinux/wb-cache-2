In 1998, the first bush {{was found on the}} island—a tea-leaved willow (Salix phylicifolia), which can grow to heights of up to 4metres (13ft). By 2008, 69species of plant had been found on Surtsey, of which about 30 had become established. This compares to the approximately 490 species found on mainland Iceland.

In World War I, a considerable majority of all deaths were caused by cannon; they were also used widely in World War II. Most modern cannon {{are similar to those}} used in the Second World War, including autocannon—with the exception of naval guns, which are now significantly smaller in caliber.|$|E
