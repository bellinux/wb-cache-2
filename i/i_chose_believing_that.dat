50|$|There is {{debate among}} viewers {{over whether or}} not what EJ did to Sami in the December 29, 2006 episode (see above) could be {{considered}} rape. In a May 3, 2007 interview, actor James Scott, portrayer of EJ, was interviewed by Sympatico/MSN/TV Guide about the subject: I don’t think they handled the rape very well, and I’ll tell you why. EJ raped Sami, and then afterwards, he’s hanging out in her house — alone with her. It’s irresponsible on so many levels.

40|$|TIES – {{a society}} {{connecting}} people When TIES {{is going into}} negotiations with ISI {{it is more important}} than ever before to define and protect the identity of the society. Some of our members would probably say that The Encyclopedia of Environmetrics defines the scope of the society. Others would describe the society as an association of scientists, who have a common interest in quantitative methods for the environmental sciences, and represent various academic disciplines, such as statistics, ecology, chemistry, etc. Regardless of which definition we <b>choose,</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> TIES must have two driving forces: a commitment to environmental issues and a genuine interest in promoting the use of quantitative methods. Because of this double dedication, TIES must also be a society connecting people who otherwise would not meet. Looking back at past activities, it is obvious that TIES has a strong ambition to attract different types of scientists. Moreover, TIES appears to have a large group of members who are socially very competent. The general atmosphere of the meetings is friendly and welcoming, and it is nice to meet old friends and make new acquaintances. However, TIES exists in a world where competitiveness is a must. It is not sufficient to be nice to each other, and there is always a risk that societies like TIES will be marginalized. When a...|$|R
40|$|First of all, I {{would like}} to {{grateful}} to Allah for giving me the mercy, guidance and many gifts until I finish this thesis. It is truly not an easy job to walk through all the process during the graduation project especially to start the whole story. There was even a hesitant when <b>I</b> finally <b>chose</b> the topic of my thesis. I could not hide my self to tell that I {{did not expect to}} involve on the thesis scope <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>chose,</b> but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> what I am doing is right and it just added the excitement and challenge on me. But, I also realize that I could not finish the thesis without helps and supports from people around me. I would never be done this thesis without people who have helped me during the process. From the first moment, Dr. Karel F. Mulder has opened the way to finally choose my path. We had discussions on several interesting and variety of subjects for my thesis. He also introduced me to the company which I have been working on during the research and helped to choose two supportive supervisors for the thesis committee. The freedom to be creative in choosing the subject of my thesis that he gave has opened my mind for the new knowledge. After all, his directions through the research could not be more useful to give more additional knowledge on this thesis...|$|R
6000|$|... {{and if he}} {{had never}} made it, I do think that its {{significance}} would have occurred to me, by a sort of instinct, in connection with this discussion. Certainly I would rather be a pagan whose religion was actual, earnest, continual--for week days, work days, and song days--than I would be a Christian who, from whatever motive, shrank from hearing or uttering the name of Christ out of a 'church.' I am no fanatic, but I like truth and earnestness in all things, and <b>I</b> cannot <b>choose</b> but <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> such a Christian shows but ill beside such a pagan. What pagan poet ever thought of casting his gods out of his poetry? In what pagan poem do they not shine and thunder? And if I--to approach the point in question--if I, writing a poem the end of which is the extolment of what I consider to be Christian truth over the pagan myths shrank even there from naming the name of my God lest it should not meet the sympathies of some readers, or lest it should offend the delicacies of other readers, or lest, generally, it should be unfit for the purposes of poetry in what more forcible manner than by that act (I appeal to Philip against Philip) can I controvert my own poem, or secure to myself and my argument a logical and unanswerable shame? If Christ's name is improperly spoken in that poem, then indeed is Schiller right, and the true gods of poetry are to be sighed for mournfully. For be sure that Burns was right, and that a poet without devotion is below his own order, and that poetry without religion will gradually lose its elevation. And then, my dear friend, we do not live among dreams. The Christian religion is true or it is not, and if it is true it offers the highest and purest objects of contemplation. And the poetical faculty, which expresses the highest moods of the mind, passes naturally to the highest objects. Who can separate these things? Did Dante? Did Tasso? Did Petrarch? Did Calderon? Did Chaucer? Did the poets of our best British days? Did any one of these shrink from speaking out Divine names when the occasion came? Chaucer, with all his jubilee of spirit and resounding laughter, had the name of Jesus Christ and God as frequently to familiarity on his lips as a child has its father's name. You say 'our religion is not vital--not week-day--enough.' Forgive me, but that is a confession of a wrong, not an argument. And if a poet be a poet, it is his business to work for the elevation and purification of the public mind, rather than for his own popularity! while if he be not a poet, no sacrifice of self-respect will make amends for a defective faculty, nor ought to make amends.|$|R

6000|$|True, a {{great deal}} of this may depend on ill-health; and will pass away as the man's bodily {{condition}} gets better. We know, in the same way, that the strange anxiety which comes over us in sleepless nights, comes from bodily causes. That is merely because, the circulation of our blood being quickened, our brain becomes more active; and because we are lying alone in the silent darkness, with nothing to listen to or look at, we cannot turn our attention away from the thoughts which get possession of us and torment us. That is only bodily; and yet it may be very useful to our souls. As we lie awake, our own past lives, our own past mistakes and sins, and God's past blessings and mercies, too, may rise up before us with clearness, and teach us more than a hundred sermons; and we may find, with David, that our reins chasten us in the night-season. 'When I am in heaviness, I will think upon God; when my heart is vexed, I will complain. Thou holdest mine eyes waking. [...] . I have considered the days of old, and the years that are past. I call to remembrance my song, and in the night I commune with my own heart, and search out my spirits. Will the Lord absent himself for ever, and will he be no more intreated? Is his mercy clean gone for ever: and is his promise come utterly to an end for evermore? Hath God forgotten to be gracious: and will he shut up his loving-kindness in displeasure? And I said it is mine own infirmity. But I will remember the years of the right hand of the Most Highest.' These sleepless hours taught the Psalmist somewhat; and they may teach us likewise. And so, again, with these sad and fretful frames of mind. Even if they do partly come from our bodies, they have a real effect, which cannot be mistaken, on our souls; and they may have a good effect on us, if we <b>choose.</b> <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> we shall find, that even if they do come from ill health and weak nerves, what starts them is--that we are dissatisfied with ourselves. We feel something wrong, not merely in our bodies, but in our souls, our characters; and then we try to lay the blame on the world around us, and shift it off ourselves; saying in our hearts, 'I should do very well, if other people, and things about me, would only let me:' but the more we try to shift off the blame, the less peace we have. Nothing mends matters less than throwing the blame on others. That is plain. Other people we cannot mend; they must mend themselves. Circumstances about us we cannot mend; God must mend them. So, as long as we throw the blame on them, we cannot return to a cheerful and hopeful frame of mind. But the moment we throw the blame on ourselves, that moment we can have hope, that moment we can become cheerful again; for whatsoever else we cannot mend, we can at least mend ourselves. Now a man may forget this in health. He may be put out and unhappy for a while: but when his good spirits return, he does not know why. Things have not improved; but, somehow, they do not affect him as they did before. Now this is not wrong. God forbid! In such a world as this, one is glad to see a man rid of sadness by any means which is not wrong. Better anything than that a poor soul should fret himself to death.|$|R
