40|$|We {{study the}} ruin problem for {{insurance}} models that involve investments. Our risk reserve process {{is an extension}} of the classical Cramér-Lundberg model, which will contain stochastic interest rates, reserve-dependent <b>expense</b> <b>loading,</b> as well as diffusion perturbed models as special cases. By introducing a new type of exponential martingale parameterized by a general rate function, we put various Cramér-Lundberg type estimations into a unified framework. We show that many existing Lundberg-type bounds for ruin probabilities can be recovered by appropriately choosing the rate function. We also prove that in this general case the ruin probability can still be expressed in terms of a special type of storage process, characterized by a generalized reflected stochastic differential equation with discontinuous paths. We apply this general storage process with large deviation techniques to analyze the limiting behavior of ruin probabilities for perturbed risk models. We provide asymptotic estimations of two types of ruin and show that in certain situations the adjustment coefficient can be derived. ...|$|E

This paper investigates the role of recent changes in the investment menu of the Singaporean Central Provident Fund (CPF) system. Our research explores the investment patterns of CPF participants and articulates their implications for policymakers. We find that most investors use their money for housing purchase and default the remainder to the CPF investment pool. The bulk of non-housing saving sits in bank accounts paying a low return. A fraction of workers does elect outside investment products, with high-income earners and males taking more risk than low-income earners and females. Since workers who default their money to the CPF fund receive a guaranteed 2. 5 % return on the Ordinary Account and 4 % on the Special Account, hurdle rates for money market and equity funds are substantial. These high hurdle rates help explain why few CPF account holders invest outside the default government in-vestment pool, though inertia probably explains why many employees let their funds sit in bank accounts earning low interest rates.

Here, the panels formed in such computation are divided across their length, and evenly (re-) distributed among all processors. It is shown how this technique can be eÆciently implemented for the general block-cyclic matrix distribution, requiring only the collective communication primitives that required for block-cyclic parallel BLAS. In most situations, panel scattering yields optimal load balance and cell computation speed across all stages of the computation. It has also advantages in naturally yielding good memory access patterns.

40|$|This {{research}} {{compares the}} effects, on performance, of changing resonant frequency and height of substrates {{in the design}} and implementation of a circular microstrip patch antennas adaptable to microwave frequencies. Computations and simulations using a program developed in FORTRAN were done based on the cavity model. Alongside these, other parameters viz actual and effective patch radii, conductance, directivity, input resistance and quality factor, which dictate the ultimate performance of the antenna were also determined. It was observed that patch radius decreases as the required resonant frequency increases (0. 2374 cm at 10. 0 GHz and 0. 05079 cm at 45. 0 GHz for GaAs). Directivity was seen to increase with resonant frequency, but at the expense of increase in conduction and dielectric losses. Radiation losses were observed to have reduced with increase in resonant frequency, which translates to the slight increase in the radiation conductance. Also, as the substrate height increases, the physical patch radius decreased, but the effective radius increases. This increase in effective radius implies that there is an increased fringing (radiation). It was also deduced that directivity increases with increase in substrate height, but at the <b>expense</b> of <b>loading</b> effect. A lower radiation conductance loss was observed at higher substrate height, but at the expense of increasing losses due to surface wave.

Hydraulic loading rate may depend on parameters such as structure, effluent quality and bulk density of filter packing, along with method of effluent application. Common Hydraulic retention time values in vermifiltration systems range from 1 to 3 hours. Hydraulic loading rates commonly vary between 0.2 m3 m−2 day−1, 3.0 m3 m−2 day−1 [...] or 10-20 g L−1.
