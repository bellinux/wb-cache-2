40|$|We exploit an {{unexpected}} <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> in an emerging market {{to study how}} capital is intermediated to firms. We find that backward-looking credit limit constraints imposed by banks {{make it difficult for}} firms to borrow, despite readily available bank liquidity, healthy aggregate demand, and a sharply falling cost of capital. The resulting aggregate failure to extend and retain capital in the economy suggests that agency costs that force banks to rely on sticky balance-sheet-based credit limits prevent emerging economies from effectively intermediating capital.

40|$|After declining {{for almost}} three decades, the food price index of the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) rose by 90 percent between January 2002 and June 2008. Besides the magnitude, the rise in prices was {{remarkable}} for its breadth, affecting {{a broad range of}} commodities including agricultural (wheat, corn, soybeans, cocoa, coffee), energy (crude oil, gasoline), and metals (copper, aluminum). According to the US Department of Agriculture, this price spike was responsible for increasing the number of malnourished people by 80 million. These dramatic developments in prices coincided with a rapid inflow of investment into the commodities futures market [...] the number of open contracts between 2001 and June 2008 increased by more than six-fold, from around 6 million to 37 million. The new investment was primarily driven by portfolio diversification motives of a new class of traders who were neither producers nor direct consumers of the underlying commodities. This dissertation examines the potential causal links between this financialization of the commodities futures market and the 2008 global spike in food prices and other commodities. The dissertation consists of three major chapters. The second chapter analyses the relationship between spot and futures markets for a range of commodities. The third and fourth chapters seek to understand the role of financialization in causing the 2008 price developments. Chapter 3 explores commodity markets individually, studying the correlation between the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and price changes. Chapter 4 studies the issue at a more macro level by investigating if the inflow of investment can explain the increase in comovement of prices between unrelated commodities. My results show that i) for many commodities, prices are determined in the futures markets, and ii) financialization of the futures market was an important factor in causing the 2008 price rises for a range of commodities. These results underscore the increasingly important role of financial motive, financial markets, and financial instruments in the operation of the commodities market. The findings are especially relevant with respect to debates as to the relative efficiency of financial markets and the need to regulate them...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, I {{study the}} {{interactions}} between {{various aspects of the}} financial system and macroeconomic volatility in a globally integrated environment. In Chapter 1, I illustrate that an efficient allocation of liquidity across projects mitigates the economy's responsiveness to global liquidity supply shocks. Emerging economies in which the allocation of liquidity is distorted serve as a buffer zone that insulates developed economies from shocks to global liquidity supply. This suggests that, when functioning properly, the financial system in the developed world increases its stability by facilitating the efficient allocation of liquidity. However, I illustrate that in a global environment in which funding is cheap, the financial system will endogenously deteriorate and cease to carryout this role effectively. The conclusion is twofold: first, an efficient allocation of liquidity has a stabilizing effect on macroeconomic fluctuations. Second, in a low interest rate environment, the economy cannot rely on the financial system to maintain the capacity to implement an efficient allocation. In Chapter 2, I suggest that intermediation need not be necessary in order to achieve an efficient allocation of liquidity; by setting an appropriately high tax on production or subsidy on unproductive savings, the government can manipulate the equilibrium prices of production inputs such that an efficient allocation of resources is achieved. Compared to the optimal policy benchmark, the equilibrium financial system absorbs too many productive resources. Further, the mere existence of a financial system induces unnecessary macroeconomic volatility in the form of liquidity shortages and surges in unemployment. I conclude that while the efficient allocation of liquidity is important both for the level of output and for output stability. financial intermediation is an inferior way to achieve it. In Chapter 3, I study the distributional implications of allowing for the intermediation of liquidity from developed to emerging economies. Liquidity suppliers from developed economies extract rents from supplying liquidity to constrained entrepreneurs in emerging markets. Financial integration is therefore associated with a regressive transfer of surplus from emerging to developed economies. Further, as input prices in emerging economies appreciate following the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> producers in emerging economies become increasingly reliant on foreign liquidity; a sudden reluctance of foreigners to supply liquidity results in a drop in output and consumption. Financial integration therefore not only decreases equilibrium consumption in emerging economies., but also increases the volatility of consumption due to shocks to external funding. by Maya Rachel Eden.

40|$|Following {{the crisis}} that {{surrounded}} the downfall of long-term capital management (LTCM) in 1998, Myron Scholes raised an important and timeless problem: how should an investment manager liquidate a portfolio when competitors in the market trade to profit from one’s misfortune? Specifically, he stated: In an unfolding crisis, most market participants respond by liquidating their most liquid investments first to reduce exposures and reduce leverage [...] However, after the liquidation, the remaining portfolio is most likely unhedged and more illiquid. Without new <b>inflows</b> <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the portfolio becomes even more costly to unwind and manage. (Scholes 2000) This problem, which I call the Scholes liquidation problem, is ubiquitous during unstable financial periods. Indeed, in the recent financial crisis, banks incurred large losses during the forced contraction of their balance sheets, as access to short-term financing through repo markets dried up (e. g., Adrian and Shin 2008; Brunnermeier 2009). A systemic deleveraging process propagated through the banking sector, in which careful liquidation became tantamount to preserving wealth and surviving the storm...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{liquidity risk}} in electronic limit order book markets. The <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> a financial security characterizes {{the speed and}} ease with which any amount of the instrument can be purchased or sold. Liquidity risk constitutes the danger that the liquidation of an asset can be very costly because trades incur high market impacts in illiquid markets - in the extreme the asset cannot be traded at all. In this thesis I focus on three specific dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> risk. Firstly, I examine how quickly new liquidity flows back into the market once the limit order book has been cleared (resiliency). Secondly, I investigate the spill-over process <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> from one asset to another asset (commonality). Thirdly, I examine the pricing implications that liquidity characteristics have {{on the price of}} the asset. In all, I find that liquidity follows a strong replenishment process which ensures the <b>inflow</b> <b>of</b> new <b>liquidity.</b> Liquidity movements tend to be market-wide with a particularly strong correlation further from the spread. In addition, I find evidence that liquidity characteristics have an impact on returns. Liquidity risk is particularly important for investors who face uncertain cash demands, who time trades or who split large trade volumes. The findings in this thesis show that there is considerable variation in liquidity and that a thorough understanding of these dynamics can contribute significantly to investment performance...|$|R

40|$|The pricing <b>of</b> total <b>liquidity</b> risk is {{studied in}} the {{cross-section}} of stock returns. The study {{suggests that there is}} a positive relation between total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns. Our measure <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is based on Amihud (2002) and its volatility is measured using daily data. Furthermore, we document that total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> is priced in the presence <b>of</b> systematic <b>liquidity</b> risk: the covariance of stock returns with aggregate <b>liquidity,</b> the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with aggregate liquidity, and the covariance <b>of</b> stock <b>liquidity</b> with the market return. The separate pricing of total volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> indicates that idiosyncratic liquidity risk is important in the cross section of returns. This result is puzzling in light of Acharya and Pedersen (2005) who develop a model in which only systematic liquidity risk affects returns. The positive correlation between the volatility <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> and expected returns suggests that risk averse investors require a risk premium for holding stocks that have high variation in liquidity. Higher variation in liquidity implies that a stock may become illiquid with higher probability {{at a time when it}} is traded.

40|$|The present {{article focuses}} on the {{internal}} factors which have potential infl uence on the <b>liquidity</b> <b>of</b> the Slovenian banking sector. Unlike other studies, this paper uses multiple dependent variables, encompassing different views on liquidity and leading to higher complexity. These include the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> its outfl ow, net change and total reallocation, determined {{on the basis of}} a specifi c method <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> measurement – the gross liquidity fl ows. The chosen independent variables include various items of internal character such as loans, deposits, profi t, capital and the size of the bank. Robust regression analyses are performed. The results indicate that internal factors have the greatest infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> where almost all the variables considered were signifi cant. Used factors do not only affect liquidity creation, often investigated by authors, but affect other dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> as well. A signifi cant item which played a role in multiple dimensions <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> was the value of loans and the size of the bank (total assets). The models have shown that any given factor only has an infl uence on the creation <b>of</b> <b>liquidity</b> without infl uencing its outfl ow and vice versa. Thus, when looking for determinants only for the creation or only for the outfl ow <b>of</b> <b>liquidity,</b> the results need not necessarily comprehensively show the infl uence of the given factors, and can lead to erroneous conclusions.
