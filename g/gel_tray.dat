40|$|This {{research}} work suggested {{a method of}} reducing grain bulk temperature and avoiding moisture transfer in a storage bin during aeration of stored grain by using a desiccant tray unit. Air humidity was adsorbed by the desiccant unit and then reduced subsequently before entering the grain silo. The simulation program was developed based on the AERO program and the model of desiccant tray which assist users in the prediction of grain temperature and moisture content. According to the ambient air condition, the number of trays would be suitably calculated for storage conditions in humid tropical regions.

40|$|Currently, {{there are}} no studies in the {{literature}} evaluating salivary fluoride retention after small amounts of fluoride gel are applied to children's teeth. Therefore, {{the objective of the}} present study was to compare salivary retention after gel application using a toothbrush or by traditional application with trays.

40|$|Maintaining an {{adequate}} {{low level of}} plaque through daily tooth brushing is often not feasible. Effective chemotherapeutic agents {{as an adjunct to}} mechanical plaque control would therefore be valuable. Chlorhexidine (CHX) mouthwash has proved to be an effective inhibitor of plaque accumulation. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to assess the effect of application of 0. 12 % CHX dentifrice gel on de novo plaque accumulation. The study was designed as a single blind, randomized three-arm parallel clinical trial. At the beginning of the test period all volunteers received a thorough professional oral prophylaxis. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of three regimens. During a 3 -day non-brushing period, subjects abstained from all forms of mechanical oral hygiene. One regimen (test group) used 0. 12 % chlorhexidine dentifrice gel (CHX-DGel, Perio. Aid) applied in a fluoride <b>gel</b> <b>tray,</b> the benchmark control group used a regular dentifrice applied in a fluoride <b>gel</b> <b>tray</b> (RegD, Everclean HEMA). The positive control group rinsed with a 0. 12 % chlorhexidine mouthwash (CHX-MW, Perio. Aid). The Quigley and Hein plaque index (PI) from all subjects was assessed after 3 days of de novo plaque accumulation. Subsequently, all subjects received a questionnaire to evaluate their attitude, appreciation and perception towards the products used employing a Visual Analogue Scale scores. After the experimental period, habitual oral hygiene procedures were resumed. Ninety-six systemically healthy subjects completed the study. After 3 days, the full-mouth PI for the CHX-DGel regimen was 1. 87 compared with 1. 93 for the RegD regimen and 1. 55 for the CHX-MW regimen. The two dentifrices (CHX-DGel and RegD) were significantly less effective as the CHX-MW (P= 0. 0006). No significant difference between scores of the dentifrices was found. Within the limitations of the present 3 -day non-brushing study design, it can be concluded that application of 0. 12 % CHX dentifrice gel is not significantly different from application of regular dentifrice on plaque accumulation. Use of a 0. 12 % CHX mouthwash is significantly more effective. CHX-DGel appears a poor alternative for a dentifrice. It is not an effective inhibitor of plaque growth and does not possess fluorid...|$|E
40|$|Aim:  The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the effects of four {{treatments}} on ‘de novo’ plaque accumulation. Treatments included tray application of 1 % chlorhexidine gel (CHX-Gel), 0. 12 % chlorhexidine dentifrice-gel (CHX-DFG), a regular dentifrice (RDF) tray application, or 0. 2 % chlorhexidine mouthwash (CHX-MW) in a 3 -day non-brushing model. Material and methods:  The study was designed as a single blind, randomized parallel clinical trial. After professional prophylaxis, subjects abstained from all other forms of oral hygiene during a 3 -day non-brushing period. Subjects were randomly assigned to one of the four test groups (CHX-Gel, CHX-DFG, RDF applied in a fluoride <b>gel</b> <b>tray</b> or rinsing with a CHX-MW). After 3 days, the Quigley & Hein plaque index (PI) and Bleeding on Marginal Probing (BOMP) index was assessed. Subsequently, all subjects received a questionnaire to evaluate their attitude, appreciation and perception towards the products used employing a Visual Analogue Scale. Results:  After 3 days, the full-mouth PI means were 0. 88 for the CHX-gel regimen, 0. 79 for CHX-MW, 1. 16 for CHX-DFG and 1. 31 for the RDF regimen. The two dentifrices (CHX-DFG and RDF) were significantly less effective than the CHX-Gel or the CHX-MW. Conclusion:  Within the limitations of the present 3 -day non-brushing study design, it can be concluded that the effect of a 1 % CHX-Gel application tray is significantly greater than that of 0. 12 % CHX-DFG or RDF in inhibiting plaque accumulation. The 1 % CHX-Gel applied via a tray and 0. 2 % CHX-MW rinse were comparably effective...|$|E

Materials and method : 30 rats of wistar strain divided to 2 groups, the control groups consist of 10 rats, and experimental group of 20 rats. The animal of control received application on their labial vestibulum with aquadest, while for the experimental group applicated with 2 % carbamide peroxyde solution. The applications were done for 1 minute, 3 times daily with 10 minutes interval periods. 5 rats of the control group and 10 of the experimental group were killed by epidural anaesthetic after 1 day application. The rest animals were killed after 3 days application. Inferior labia then taken as specimen, fixated using formaldehyde and processed for microscopic slides, stained with HE. Microscopic analyze were done using modified inflammation scoring system developed by Eda & Fukuyama. Statistical analyze shows that there are significant differences of the experimental group inflammation between 1 day and 3 days application.

Tooth color shade in anterior teeth, supragingival plaque and gingivitis in Ramfjord teeth, as well as visual assessment of teeth gingival tissues and mucosa were evaluated in-office prior to treatment, after two consecutive applications of the 9 % hydrogen peroxide bleaching product, after eight applications (10 minutes/day for 3 days at home), and after ten applications (50 minutes exposure over 5 days). Color stability was evaluated at 3 months after completing the treatment regimen. Over-the-counter bleaching products {{can be used by}} the patient at home without dentist supervision, but are frequently associated with gingival irritation and tooth sensitivity despite low concentrations of peroxide agents. Our investigations showed that the treatment is tolerable and safe with a low incidence of adverse effects. Any adverse effects associated with use of the whitening <b>gel</b> and <b>tray</b> are temporary, easily controlled, and often disappear within minutes of treatment.

The absorbent fiber, when mixed with water and dietary ingredients, produced a diet medium of homogeneous texture that supported larval growth and development comparable with the standard gelled diet. Larval and pupal weights from two concentrations of cellulose fiber-based diet {{were significantly higher than}} those obtained using gelled diet. The number of pupae per tray, percentage of adult emergence, oviposition, percentage of egg hatch, and adult longevity obtained from the insects reared in the cellulose fiber-based diet were comparable or slightly better than the biological parameters recorded from flies reared in the gelled diet. Moreover, results indicate that a lesser amount of the cellulose fiber-based diet than the normal amount of <b>gelled</b> diet per <b>tray</b> would support normal larval growth. Physical properties and texture of the new diet seem to allow the larvae to move and feed more freely than they do on the semisolid gelled diet, resulting in less wasted diet. The cellulose fiber is biodegradable and inexpensive, whereas the polyacrylate gel polymer is not biodegradable and is relatively expensive. Replacing gel with cellulose fiber in the screwworm larval diet for mass rearing should result in substantial cost savings in material and labor as well as eliminating concern of environmental pollution due to diet waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: This triple-blind, 2 x 2 {{crossover}} in situ study, {{was undertaken}} to verify whether the wear resistance of enamel and root dentine {{would be affected}} by bleaching with a 10 % carbamide peroxide agent and a placebo agent. Methods: Thirty slabs of each. substrate (2 mm x 3 mm x 2 mm) were selected for each phase, after flattening and polishing procedures and microhardness test. After a 7 -day lead-in period, one specimen of each substrate was randomly bonded on the facial surface of each one of 30 subject`s upper second premolars. The volunteers received instructions on how to perform toothbrushing and application of <b>gel</b> in the <b>tray.</b> Fifteen volunteers bleached their maxillary arch with a 10 % carbamide peroxide bleaching agent for a 2 -week period, while the remainders used a placebo agent. After a 1 -week washout period, a new set of enamel and root dentine slabs were bonded to the premolars and volunteers were crossed over to the alternate agent for 14 days. The resistance of enamel and root dentine to wear following bleaching, toothbrushing and intraoral exposure was measured with a profilometer, using reference areas. Results: For enamel, ANOVA did not demonstrate significant difference between wear provided by placebo and bleaching agent (p = 0. 3713), but higher wear depth was observed for bleached root dentine (p = 0. 0346). Conclusions: While overnight bleaching caused no alteration in wear resistance of enamel, root dentine showed increased tissue loss. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|Gingival {{recession}} {{associated with}} aging and periodontal therapy exposes root surfaces, {{which are then}} susceptible to root caries. Resin-modified glass ionomer, glass ionomer, compomer, composite resin, and amalgam restora-tive materials are frequently used to restore carious root lesions. Amalgam continues to be used successfully to restore root caries. Resin composites, compomers, glass ionomers, and resin-modified glass ionomers are increas-ing in popularity because they are aesthetic and bond to tooth structure. Unfortunately, only modest evidence from controlled clinical trials is avail-able to {{support the use of}} any of these materials for high caies—risk patients. Recurrent caries receives little attention from investigators of clin-ical trials, who normally select low caries—risk patients in whom to place restorations. In the most recent meeting of the International Association for Dental Research, out of 2167 abstracts only one paper was presented that summarized the results of a clinical trial evaluating recurrent caries associated with restorative materials in high caries—risk patients. [1] This lack of data makes specific material recommendations for the restoration of root-surface caries difficult, although some data are appearing. Recent evidence demonstrates that fluoride-releasing materials inhibit recurrent car-ies in restored root surfaces. Although fluoride supplements reduce caries in high-risk patients, the effects seen from these materials are related to the fluoride released. Fluoride-containing solutions have a dose-response rela-tionship to caries. The higher the fluoride in the solution or released from a restoration, the greater the protection. Fluoride <b>gels,</b> delivered in <b>trays,</b> bathe the tooth with significantly greater amounts of fluoride compared with the amounts of fluoride released from restorative materials. The percent of caries reduction when gels are used is therefore greater...|$|R

We selected 35 high-caries-risk, post-radiation, xerostomic adults with a parts per thousand yen 3 cervical carious lesions in the same arch. Every patient received a KetacFil (KF), PhotacFil (PF) and Herculite XRV (HX) restoration. Patients were instructed to use a neutral 1 % sodium fluoride <b>gel</b> in custom <b>trays,</b> on a daily basis. After 6, 12, 18 and 24 months, the restorations were examined for material loss, marginal integrity and recurrent caries. Fluoride compliance was determined at each recall appointment and recorded as the percentage of recommended use during that interval [compliance of a parts per thousand currency sign 50 % = NFUs, > 50 % = FUs]. Only 30 patients were available for recall at 6 months, with 28 patients at 12 and 18 months, and 27 patients at 24 months. In the NFU group, differences in recurrent caries were found between KF and HX at all observation times (p < 0. 05). Differences (p < 0. 05) in adaptation and/or anatomical form were found between KF and PF in NFUs after 18 and 24 months. In FUs, significant differences were observed between KF and PF, and KF and HX after 6 and 12 months, between KF and HX, PF and HX after 18 and 24 months.

Prepare columns (have blank precolumn, SNpeptide column [and for purification/sequencing, a Con A column]) in step 3) by first draining, then equilibrating in 6 volumes of column running buffer. Following equilibration, columns should be ‘preconditioned’ with 5 column buffers of eluant buffer (ie. column running buffer containing 1 µg/ml heparin), then wash with 6 column volumes of column running buffer. Allow supernatant to flow through precolumn into Con A or SNpeptide column. Incubate 6 hr to overnight at 4 °C. ![Table 2]([URL] "Table 2 ") 5. Wash with 20 column volumes of column running buffer.

Elute Con A column with 5 ml column running buffer containing 0. 4 M a-methylmannoside. Next wash columns with 5 column volumes of column running buffer containing 1 M NaCl, 5 column volumes of column running buffer and then the same volume of 50 mM Tris containing 0. 02 % Azide for storage (4 °C). Be sure to keep column running without stop. 6. Subsequent analysis of eluant fractions can be performed following acetone precipitation of individual fractions, or spin concentration of all eluant fractions combined. For acetone precipitation (in 1. 5 ml screw top tubes, add 300 µl of each fraction to 300 µl of - 20 °C 100 % acetone, mix and store overnight at - 20 °C. Spin for 15 min at 4 °C, pull/discard supernatant and add 1 ml/tube of 50 % acetone (precooled to - 20 °C), mix and spin for 15 min at 4 °C. Remove/discard supernatant. Use yellow tip to remove all remaining supernatant and let pellet dry for 1 hr at RT.
