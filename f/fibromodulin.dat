The superficial layer LPs (SLLPs), {{also known as}} Reinke's space, is composed of amorphous substance and microfibrils which allows this cover layer to “slide” over the deep layer easily. The vibratory and viscoelastic characteristics of human VFs are mainly attributed to the molecular composition of SLLPs. In normal vocal fold, the jelly-like “Reinke's space” is very loose and abundant with interstitial proteins such as hyaluronic acid, fibronectin, proteoglycan like <b>fibromodulin,</b> decorin and versican. All these ECM components together regulate the water content of vocal fold and render the viscous shear property for it. [...] The squamous epithelium and superficial lamina propria form the vocal mucosa which serves as vibratory component in phonation. The mucosa layer vibrates at a frequency range of 100–1000Hz and displacement at 1mm approximately. The intermediate layer of LPs consists primarily of elastic fiber while the deep layer LP consists of fewer elastin and more collagen fibers. These two layers have poor differentiated boundary but are increasingly stiffer than SLLPs. The intermediate and deep layers of LPs compose the vocal ligaments which are enclosed within the vocal folds and are responsible for strain in phonation. Within the ECM community of vocal ligament, fibrous proteins such as elastin and collagen are pivotal in maintaining the proper elastic biomechanical property of vocal fold. Elastin fibers impart the flexibility and elasticity of the vocal folds and, collagen {{is responsible for the}} resistance and resiliece to tensile strength. The normal strain level of vocal ligament ranges from 0–15% during phonation These fibrous proteins exhibit distribution variations spatially and temporally due to fibroblast turnover during tissue maturation and aging.

50|$|The {{putative}} signalling pathway of TNMD {{is largely}} unknown due to unidentified direct binding partners. Many knockout mouse models with tendon phenotypes have helped in understanding which upstream factors or pathways affect Tnmd expression. Similarly, {{the generation of}} Tnmd knockout mouse model allowed the suggestion of possible downstream effectors. It is important to emphasize {{that most of the}} below studies show correlations between Tnmd expression or function to other genes and not a direct link in a common signalling cascade.Regarding upstream regulators of Tnmd expression the description of the scleraxis (Scx) knockout mouse line suggested that Scx can directly drive Tnmd transcription, because Scx deletion led to complete elimination of Tnmd expression. Overexpression of scleraxis in cultured tenocytes or in mesenchymal stem cells significantly upregulated Tnmd expression. The deletion of myostatin in mice resulted in a parallel decrease in Scx and Tnmd mRNA levels, while myostatin stimulation of fibroblasts led to their upregulation, suggesting myostatin as an upstream factor in the Tnmd pathway. Egr1/2 transcription factors can induce Scx and collagen I gene expression, hence {{it would be interesting to}} investigate if Egr1 or 2 also can affect Tnmd expression. The absence of the Mohawk (Mkx) gene led to significantly lower Tnmd expression as well as collagen I and <b>fibromodulin.</b> A significant loss of Tnmd was noticeable in Mkx knockouts at E16.5, while Scx expression was unchanged 22, suggesting that Mkx can also directly affect Tnmd expression. Activation of the Wnt/β-catenin signalling pathway in bone marrow-derived stem cells resulted in Tnmd upregulation. Scx and Mkx expression were unaffected, suggesting the Wnt/ β-catenin signalling works independent from these transcription factors.Regarding downstream factors, the Tnmd knockout mouse model suggested correlation to collagen I based on the observed abnormal collagen fibrillogenesis resulting in pathologically thicker fibres. The lower cellular density and proliferation in the mutant tendons, as well as the reduced self-renewal and earlier senescence of Tnmd-deficient tendon stem/progenitor cells was coupled with downregulation of the proliferative marker Cyclin D1 and upregulation of the senescent marker p53. A study analysing ruptures of human chordae tendineae cordis revealed loss of Tnmd expression in the affected area coupled with upregulation of VEGF-A and MMP1, 2 and 13.|$|E
5000|$|Mature human {{vocal folds}} are {{composed}} of layered structures which are quite different at the histological level. The topmost layer comprises stratified squamous epithelium which is bordered by ciliated pseudostratified epithelium. The inner lining surface of this squamous epithelium is covered by a layer of mucus (acting as a mucociliary clearance), which is composed of two layers: a mucinous layer and serous layer. Both mucus layers provide viscous and watery environment for cilia beating posteriorally and superiorly. The mucociliary clearance keeps the vocal folds essentially moist and lubricated.The epidermis layer is secured to the deeper connective tissue by basement membrane. Due to the primarily amorphous fibrous and nonfibrous proteins in the lamina propria, the basement membrane applies strong anchoring filaments like collagen Ⅳ and Ⅶ to secure the hemidesmosome of basal cell to the lamina propria. These attachments {{are strong enough to}} sustain beating and stretch, to which VFs are subjected.

Using a collagen fibril formation/sedimentation assay we show that <b>fibromodulin</b> inhibits the binding of lumican, and vice versa. <b>Fibromodulin</b> and lumican do not affect the binding of decorin to collagen, nor does decorin inhibit the binding of <b>fibromodulin</b> or lumican.

40|$|The genomic {{structure}} of murine <b>fibromodulin</b> was determined, and its age-related expression and distribution were characterized in knee epiphyses, with decorin studied for reference. <b>Fibromodulin,</b> {{as well as}} decorin, have roles in collagen fibrillogenesis both in vitro and in vivo. The murine <b>fibromodulin</b> gene, Fmod, was similar with that in other species, with three exons and 86 % of the translated sequence in exon 2. The 2. 7 kb long cDNA contains an open reading frame of 1131 nt. <b>Fibromodulin</b> mRNA levels were highest in tissues rich in fibrillar collagens type I or type II. During growth, the distribution of <b>fibromodulin</b> mRNA was similar with that of type II collagen, with the highest levels between 5 days and 1 month of age. Thereafter, the expression of type II collagen declined to a level near the detection limit, whereas the <b>fibromodulin</b> expression decreased less markedly {{to a level of}} approx. 35 % of maximum, and remained constant {{throughout the rest of the}} observation period. In contrast, decorin mRNA levels were the highest in old animals. Pericellular deposition of <b>fibromodulin</b> was strong around the late-hypertrophic chondrocytes of the secondary ossification centre and in the growth plate. In young epiphyses, both <b>fibromodulin</b> and decorin were found interterritorially, mainly in the uncalcified and deep-calcified cartilage. In the old mice, calcified cartilage became enriched with regard to <b>fibromodulin,</b> while, in contrast, decorin deposition diminished, particularly near the tidemark. In the subchondral bone trabeculae, decorin was found in the endosteum of growing, but not in the mature, epiphyses. Differences in the expression and distribution profiles suggest different roles for <b>fibromodulin</b> and decorin in the regulation of collagen fibrillogenesis, maintenance of the fibril organization and matrix mineralization. As <b>fibromodulin</b> is deposited closer to cells than decorin, it may have a primary role in collagen fibrillogenesis, whereas decorin might be involved in the maintenance of fibril structures in the interterritorial matrix...|$|E
40|$|SummaryAn anti-peptide {{antibody}} {{was raised}} in a rabbit against the carboxy terminal region of the human <b>fibromodulin</b> core protein. The antibody was purified from other components of the resulting antiserum by affinity chromatography using the immobilized peptide, and was used to study the structural heterogeneity of <b>fibromodulin</b> extracted from human articular cartilage of different ages by the use of immunoblotting following sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis analysis of the extracted macromolecules. In the fetus and neonate, <b>fibromodulin</b> was visualized as a diffuse component with a relative molecular weight of 70 – 110 kDa, whereas in the mature adult a more discrete component of smaller size was apparent with a relative molecular weight of 67 kDa. The size of the <b>fibromodulin</b> from mature adult cartilage could not be altered by pretreatment of the samples with keratanase II or endo-β-galactosidase before analysis. In contrast, the size of the <b>fibromodulin</b> from younger cartilage could be decreased with both glycosidases, with the endo-β-galactosidase yielding a smaller product than the keratanase. The size of the product resulting from endo-β-galactosidase treatment of the <b>fibromodulin</b> from young cartilage was {{the same as that of}} the intact <b>fibromodulin</b> from mature adult cartilage. Thus, <b>fibromodulin</b> is present in human articular cartilage at all ages, but the extracted molecules only appear to exist in a proteoglycan form possessing keratan sulfate chains in the juvenile and young adult, and the size of these chains decreases with age. In the mature adult the <b>fibromodulin</b> does not possess either keratan sulfate or non-sulfated polylactosamine chains, though it appears to possess the same number of N-linked oligosaccharides as its counterparts from the younger tissue, but they are not modified further. The majority of the <b>fibromodulin</b> extracted from arthritic cartilage is of the same size as that found in the normal mature adult, although there is evidence for proteolytic processing. The degree of such processing is greater for the <b>fibromodulin</b> obtained from the cartilage of rheumatoid arthritic joints than osteoarthritic joints...|$|E

The N-terminal domain mimics heparin, binding proteins with clustered basic amino acid residues. Because heparin affects collagen fibril formation, we investigated whether tyrosine sulfate is involved in <b>fibromodulin</b> interactions with collagen. Using full-length <b>fibromodulin</b> and its N-terminal tyrosine-sulfated domain purified from tissue, as well as recombinant <b>fibromodulin</b> fragments, we found that the N-terminal domain binds collagen.

The N-terminal domain shortened the collagen fibril formation lag phase and tyrosine sulfation was required for this effect.

This fragment does not bind to type I collagen. Using enzymes with different specificities, a number of large fragments of <b>fibromodulin</b> were obtained, suggesting a compact structure for this molecule which is relatively resistant to proteolysis. None of these N-glycosylated fragments were able to bind to type I collagen in co-sedimentation experiments. Taken together these results suggest that fibromodulin-type I collagen interactions leading to fibrillogenesis inhibition require more than one binding domain. One of these domains could be the C-terminal end of the molecule containing the disulphide loop which is absent in the chymotrypsin-resistant fragment...|$|E
40|$|Cells {{undergoing}} replicative senescence display {{an altered}} pattern of gene expression. Senescent fibroblasts show {{significant changes in}} the expression of mRNAs encoding extracellular matrix-remodeling proteins; among these mRNAs, the mRNA encoding <b>fibromodulin</b> is highly decreased in these cells. To understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon, we explored the regulatory mechanisms of the human <b>fibromodulin</b> gene. We found that <b>fibromodulin</b> gene promoter contains a cis-element, crucial for its basal expression, that forms a DNA-protein complex when exposed to nuclear extracts from exponentially growing human fibroblasts and not to extracts from cells undergoing senescence by repeated in vitro passages or by mild oxidative stress. The purification of this complex showed that it contains the damage-specific DNA-binding protein DDB- 1. The latter is known to be induced by UV irradiation; therefore we checked whether <b>fibromodulin</b> gene promoter is regulated upon the exposure of the cells to UV rays. The results showed that, in exponentially growing fibroblasts, the promoter efficiency is increased by UV irradiation and the DDB- 1 -containing complex is robustly enriched in cells exposed to UV light. Accordingly, in these experimental conditions the endogenous <b>fibromodulin</b> mRNA accumulates to very high levels. On the contrary, senescent cells did not show any activation of the <b>fibromodulin</b> gene promoter, any induction of the DDB- 1 -containing complex, or any accumulation of <b>fibromodulin</b> mRNA. These phenomena are accompanied in senescent cells by a decrease of the UV-damaged DNA binding activit...|$|E

Fibromodulin-deficient apolipoprotein E-null mice have decreased vascular retention of lipids and reduced development of atherosclerosis suggesting that <b>fibromodulin</b> may influence the disease process. The aim {{of the present study}} was to investigate if <b>fibromodulin</b> and lumican are expressed in human carotid plaques and to determine if their expression is associated with the occurrence of preoperative symptoms and with risk for postoperative cardiovascular events...|$|E
40|$|A 450 bp cDNA {{fragment}} {{similar to}} that encoding bovine <b>fibromodulin</b> was isolated using a screening procedure to isolate genes differentially expressed between the pre- and post-growth phases of fibril growth in the developing chicken embryo metatarsal tendon. Using this fragment, a 2. 4 kb cDNA clone for chicken <b>fibromodulin</b> was isolated from a lambda ZAP library, and the 5 ' rapid amplification of cDNA ends technique was employed to clone the 5 'end of the <b>fibromodulin</b> cDNA. The full-length cDNA contained an open reading frame coding for a 380 -amino-acid protein. There was approximately 80 % similarity with human, rat and bovine fibromodulins, which confirmed its identity as <b>fibromodulin.</b> Structural features of the deduced sequence include an 18 -amino-acid signal peptide, cysteine residues in conserved positions in the N- and C-terminal regions, and a central leucine-rich domain containing eleven repeats of the sequence LXXLXLXXNXL/I. Features unique to chicken <b>fibromodulin</b> include an additional glycosylation site {{as well as a}} decreased number of tyrosine residues that could be sulphated, and therefore potential changes in the charge of the molecule. In addition, there was little similarity among the untranslated regions. When compared with chicken decorin and lumican, <b>fibromodulin</b> showed greater similarity to the other keratan sulphate-containing proteoglycan, lumican. Northern blot analysis revealed a 6 - 8 -fold increase in the <b>fibromodulin</b> mRNA level from day 14 to day 19 of development. In the chicken tendon, collagen fibril growth is a process characterized by a precipitous increase in length during a short developmental period. The necessary changes would require the expression of different genes regulating fibril formation and growth, and interactions between <b>fibromodulin</b> and collagen fibrils may participate in the regulation of collagen fibril growth and matrix assembly...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fibromodulin</b> from bovine {{articular}} cartilage {{has been subjected}} to lectin affinity chromatography by Sambucus nigra lectin which binds  2 - 6) - linked N-acetylneuraminic acid, and the structure of the keratan sulphate in the binding and non-binding fractions examined by keratanase II digestion and subsequent high pH anion exchange chromatography. It has been confirmed that the keratan sulphate chains attached to <b>fibromodulin</b> isolated from bovine {{articular cartilage}} may have the chain terminating N-acetylneuraminic acid residue  2 - 3) - or  2 - 6) -linked to the adjacent galactose residue. Although the abundance of  2 - 6) linked N-acetylneuraminic acid (ca. 22 %) is such that this could cap one of the four chains in almost all <b>fibromodulin</b> molecules, it was found that ca. 34 % of the <b>fibromodulin</b> proteoglycan molecules from bovine articular cartilage were capped exclusively with  2 - 3) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid. The remainder of the <b>fibromodulin</b> proteoglycans which bound to the lectin had a mixture of  2 - 3) - and  2 - 6) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid capping structures. The keratan sulphates attached to <b>fibromodulin</b> molecules capped exclusively with  2 - 3) - linked N-acetylneuraminic acid were found to have a higher level of galactose sulphation than those from <b>fibromodulin</b> with both  2 - 3) and  2 - 6) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid caps which bound to the Sambucus nigra lectin. In addition, both pools contained chains of similar length (ca. 8 - 9 disaccharides). Both also contained  1 - 3) -linked fucose, showing that this feature does not co-distribute with  2 - 6) -linked N-acetylneuraminic acid, although these two features are present only in mature articular cartilage. These data show that there are discrete populations of <b>fibromodulin</b> within articular cartilage which may have differing impacts upon tissue processes...|$|E
40|$|Ultraviolet (UV) {{radiation}} {{affects the}} extracellular matrix (ECM) {{of the human}} skin. The small leucine-rich repeat protein <b>fibromodulin</b> interacts with type I and II collagen fibrils, thereby affecting ECM assembly. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate whether short wave UV (UVB) or long wave UV (UVA) irradiation influences <b>fibromodulin</b> expression. Exponentially growing human fibroblasts (IMR- 90 cells) were exposed to increasing doses of UVB (2. 5 - 60 mJ/cm(2)) or UVA (0. 5 - 10 J/cm(2)). After UV irradiation <b>fibromodulin,</b> p 21 and GADD 45 levels were evaluated as well as cell viability, reactive oxygen species formation (ROS) and DNA damage. We found that <b>fibromodulin</b> expression: (i) increased after UVB and UVA irradiation; (ii) was 10 -fold higher after UVA (10 J/cm(2)) versus 5 -fold with UVB (10 mJ/cm(2)); (iii) correlated with reactive oxygen species formation, particularly after UVA; and (iv) was linked to the DNA damage binding protein (DDB 1) translocation in the nucleus, particularly after UVB. These results further suggest that the UV-induced <b>fibromodulin</b> increase could counteract the UV-induced connective tissue damage, promoting the assembly of new collagen fibrils...|$|E
40|$|Small leucine-rich repeat {{proteoglycans}} (SLRP) {{are present}} in the extracellular matrix of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) disc. Lumican and <b>fibromodulin,</b> classified as class 2 SLRPs, play important roles in TMJ assembly, proliferation and inflammation. Degenerative change in the TMJ disc gives rise to the process of internal derangement (ID). In this study, we immunohistochemically examined the expression of lumican and <b>fibromodulin</b> in nine human TMJ specimens and examined the gene expression of both proteoglycans in cultured human TMJ disc cells under interleukin- 1 beta (IL- 1 β) -stimulated conditions. An articular disc cell line was established by collagenase treatment of a TMJ disc. The subcultured cells were then incubated for 1, 3, 6, 12, 24 or 48 h under both normal and IL- 1 β (1 ng/mL) conditions. The gene expression of lumican and <b>fibromodulin</b> was examined using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and real-time RT-PCR. We demonstrated that the expression of lumican significantly differs from that of <b>fibromodulin</b> in the deformed disc and that IL- 1 β induces a significant increase in lumican mRNA, but not in <b>fibromodulin</b> mRNA, after 24 ~ 48 h culture compared to cells cultured in the absence of IL- 1 β (P< 0. 05). These results indicate that lumican and <b>fibromodulin</b> display different behaviors and that lumican may promote regeneration of the TMJ after degeneration and deformation induced by IL- 1 β...|$|E
40|$|Transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β 1, -β 2, and -β 3) {{has been}} implicated in the ontogenetic {{transition}} from scarless fetal repair to adult repair with scar. Generally, TGF-β exerts its effects through type I and II receptors; however, TGF-β modulators such as latent TGF-β binding protein- 1 (LTBP- 1), decorin, biglycan, and <b>fibromodulin</b> can bind and potentially inhibit TGF-β activity. To more fully explore the role of TGF-β ligands, receptors, and potential modulators during skin development and wound healing, {{we have used a}} rat model that transitions from scarless fetal-type repair to adult-type repair with scar between days 16 and 18 of gestation. We showed that TGF-β ligand and receptor mRNA levels did not increase during the transition to adult-type repair in fetal skin, whereas LTBP- 1 and <b>fibromodulin</b> expression decreased. In addition, TGF-β 1 and -β 3; type I, II, and III receptors; as well as LTBP- 1, decorin, and biglycan were up-regulated during adult wound healing. In marked contrast, <b>fibromodulin</b> expression was initially down-regulated in adult repair. Immunostaining demonstrated significant <b>fibromodulin</b> induction 36 hours after injury in gestation day 16, but not day 19, fetal wounds. This inverse relationship between <b>fibromodulin</b> expression and scarring in both fetal and adult rat wound repair suggests that <b>fibromodulin</b> may be a biologically relevant modulator of TGF-β activity during scar formation...|$|E
