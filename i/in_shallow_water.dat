5|$|Although {{the cattle}} egret {{sometimes}} feeds <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water,</b> unlike most herons it is typically found in fields and dry grassy habitats, reflecting its greater dietary reliance on terrestrial insects rather than aquatic prey.|$|E
5|$|Many corals in {{the order}} Scleractinia are hermatypic, meaning that they are {{involved}} in building reefs. Most such corals obtain some of their energy from zooxanthellae in the genus Symbiodinium. These are symbiotic photosynthetic dinoflagellates which require sunlight; reef-forming corals are therefore found mainly <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water.</b> They secrete calcium carbonate to form hard skeletons that become the framework of the reef. However, not all reef-building corals <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> contain zooxanthellae, and some deep water species, living at depths to which light cannot penetrate, form reefs but do not harbour the symbionts.|$|E
5|$|The area of {{the park}} was astride a passive {{continental}} margin during the Precambrian and early Paleozoic. Sediment was derived from continental sources and was deposited <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water.</b> These rocks have since been metamorphosed.|$|E

5|$|They roost <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water,</b> {{where they}} may be safe from some ground predators. Adult birds do not moult their {{feathers}} annually and instead feathers are replaced once {{every two or three}} years.|$|E
5|$|Anthozoans are carnivores, {{catching}} prey {{with their}} tentacles. Many species supplement their energy needs by {{making use of}} photosynthetic single-celled algae that live within their tissues. These species live <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> and many are reef-builders. Other species lack the zooxanthellae and, having no need for well-lit areas, typically live in deep-water locations.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water,</b> usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to dry up in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E

5|$|Golden jackals are {{extremely}} harmful to fur-bearing rodents, such as coypu and muskrats. Coypu can be completely extirpated <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> bodies. During 1948–1949 in the Amu Darya, muskrats constituted 12.3% of jackal faecal contents, and 71% of muskrat houses {{were destroyed by}} jackals. Jackals also harm the fur industry by eating muskrats caught in traps or taking skins left out to dry.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1944, Schlesiens and Schleswig-Holsteins {{anti-aircraft}} armament {{was considerably}} strengthened {{to allow them}} to be used as an air defense ships in the port of Gotenhafen. Schleswig-Holstein was attacked by RAF bombers in December 1944, and although she was sunk <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water,</b> her weapons could still be used. After a fire permanently disabled the ship, her crew was sent ashore to assist in the defense of Marienburg. Starting in 1944, Hannover was broken up for scrap; work lasted until 1945. Schlesien provided fire support for German troops in the vicinity of Gotenhafen between 15 and 21 March 1945. In April, Schlesien was moved to Swinemünde to restock her ammunition supply as well as evacuate 1,000 wounded soldiers from the front. On 3 May she struck a mine outside Swinemünde; the following day she was scuttled by her crew <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water.</b> Both ships were broken up in situ after the war.|$|E
5|$|Social {{aggregation}} is {{well documented}} in grey reef sharks. In the northwestern Hawaiian Islands, large numbers of pregnant adult females have been observed slowly swimming in circles <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water,</b> occasionally exposing their dorsal fins or backs. These groups last from 11:00 to 15:00, corresponding to peak daylight hours. Similarly, at Sand Island off Johnston Atoll, females form aggregations <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> from March to June. The number of sharks per group differs from year to year. Each day, the sharks begin arriving at the aggregation area at 09:00, reaching a peak in numbers during the hottest {{part of the day}} in the afternoon, and dispersing by 19:00. Individual sharks return to the aggregation site every one to six days. These female sharks are speculated to be taking advantage of the warmer water to speed their growth or that of their embryos. The shallow waters may also enable them to avoid unwanted attention by males.|$|E

5|$|The American {{black duck}} is an {{omnivorous}} species with a diverse diet. It feeds by dabbling <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> and grazing on land. Its plant diet primarily includes {{a wide variety}} of wetland grasses and sedges, and the seeds, stems, leaves and root stalks of aquatic plants, such as eelgrass, pondweed and smartweed. Its animal diet includes mollusks, snails, amphipods, insects, mussels and small fishes.|$|E
5|$|The German {{heavy cruiser}} , ship #36, survived both the Able and Baker tests but was too {{radioactive}} to have leaks repaired. In September 1946 she was towed to Kwajalein Atoll, where she capsized <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> on December 22, 1946, {{five months after}} Baker. She remains there today, with starboard propeller blades in the air.|$|E
5|$|The {{sisters were}} attacked, but not hit, during the American aerial attack on Kure in July 1945. However, the shockwaves from near misses caused {{extensive}} flooding in both ships. Iwate sank <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> on 25 July and Izumo capsized three days later. Both ships {{were removed from}} the navy list on 20 November and their wrecks were raised and scrapped in 1946–47.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months later}} a second {{opportunity}} presented itself. Another old ship, the Haines, sank <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> while being towed off Plum Tree Island {{and became a}} hazard to navigation. The 2nd Bombardment Group redeemed itself by completely destroying the derelict from the air, even though their only visible target was a ten-foot-square float marker. This accomplishment, however, went entirely unpublicized.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Texas {{returned}} to peacetime duty, interrupted by several refits. She became the station ship in Charleston, South Carolina, by 1908 and was renamed San Marcos in 1911 {{to allow her}} name {{to be used by}} a new battleship. She became a target ship that same year and was sunk <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> in Chesapeake Bay. She was used as a gunnery target through World War II and was finally demolished in 1959 because her remains were considered a navigational hazard.|$|E
5|$|At a {{distance}} of , the Japanese fleet began to fire on the Chaoyong. Within a few minutes, fires broke out, which quickly engulfed the central superstructure with its numerous wooden partitions covered with thick layers of flammable varnish applied over the years. Yangwei quickly suffered the same fate. As the Chaoyong attempted to make way to a nearby island to beach itself, it collided with the Chinese cruiser , before listing to starboard and sinking <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> nearby. Some of the crew were rescued by a Chinese torpedo boat engaged in the battle.|$|E

In 2009, a critical documentary on the hunts in Japan titled The Cove was released and shown amongst others at the Sundance Film Festival. Well known are also the images from Iki Island taken in 1979 of a Japanese fisherman stabbing dolphins to death with spears <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water.</b>|$|E
5|$|Megalodon {{inhabited}} a {{wide range}} of marine environments (i.e., shallow coastal waters, areas of coastal upwelling, swampy coastal lagoons, sandy littorals, and offshore deep water environments), and exhibited a transient lifestyle. Adult megalodon were not abundant <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water</b> environments, and mostly inhabited offshore areas. Megalodon may have moved between coastal and oceanic waters, particularly in different stages of its life cycle. However, megalodon teeth have been excavated from regions far away from continental lands, such as the Marianas Trench in the Pacific Ocean.|$|E
5|$|Member {{species are}} usually annuals or {{herbaceous}} perennials. Flowers are red, pink, or yellow, often in various combinations. A {{large number of}} the Erythranthe species grow in moist to wet soils with some growing even <b>in</b> <b>shallow</b> <b>water.</b> They are not very drought resistant, {{but many of the}} species now classified as Diplacus are. Species are found at elevations from oceanside to high mountains as well as a wide variety of climates, though most prefer wet areas such as riverbanks.|$|E
