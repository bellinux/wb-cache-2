40|$|We {{prove that}} the class of residually C <b>groups</b> <b>is</b> closed under taking graph products, {{provided}} that C is closed under taking subgroups, finite direct products and that free-by-C <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> residually C.

In particular, we prove that graph products of residually amenable <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> residually amenable, and that locally embeddable into amenable <b>groups</b> <b>are</b> closed under taking graph products.

40|$|A single {{experiment}} {{investigated the}} influence of varying dimensions of visual stimuli {{on the ability of}} academically gifted adolescents to recall paired-associations. Fifty-two participants were {{randomly assigned to one of}} four <b>groups.</b> Each <b>group</b> <b>was</b> asked to memorize the same set of 15 paired-word associations. The first <b>group</b> <b>was</b> presented with words only. The second <b>group</b> <b>was</b> presented with words and 2 - dimensional (2 -D) representations of each word. The third <b>group</b> <b>was</b> presented with words along with 3 -dimensional (3 -D) representations of the words. The fourth <b>group</b> <b>was</b> also presented words along with 3 -D objects; however, this <b>group</b> <b>was</b> instructed to actively manipulate the objects. The recall accuracies of each <b>group</b> <b>were</b> measured directly after the presentation of the last word pair in the set. Large within-group variation prevented significant differences between the accuracy of the groups...|$|R

5|$|Males, {{females and}} juveniles each form {{separate}} social groups. The male groups are the smallest; the members stay together {{and search for}} food or water sources. The female <b>group</b> <b>is</b> much larger and covers greater areas. They travel the grassy plains in wet periods and prefer bushy areas in dry periods. Females have a complex linear hierarchy. The nursery and juvenile <b>group</b> <b>is</b> naturally formed when females give birth to calves. After about 24 hours of the delivery, the mother and calf join this group. The calves start befriending each other and stay back in the nursery group while the mother returns to the female group.
