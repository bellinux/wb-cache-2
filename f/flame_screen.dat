40|$|Water spray {{screening}} is a mitigation {{technique to}} reduce thermal radiation from flames to acceptable levels required by safety regulations. The current literature on water screening {{is limited to}} hydrocarbon flames. The main goal {{of the present study}} is to bridge this knowledge gap by presenting a methodology to predict the water spray screening performance of hydrogen flames using their actual emission spectra. A wide range of hydrogen <b>flames</b> and water <b>screen</b> scenarios are investigated. The results show that although hydrogen flames' emissivities are relatively lower than hydrocarbons', the radiated heat could pose safety risks and water screening is an effective mitigating method. The study further analyses the total transmissivity of water screens calculated from (i) the actual hydrogen spectrum and (ii) a blackbody spectrum. For optically thick spray screens, the blackbody spectrum widely used for hydrocarbon <b>flames</b> <b>screening,</b> could yield unacceptable overestimations of the total transmissivity...|$|R

50|$|It was {{not until}} after Smith's death in 1989 that larger {{institutions}} started to <b>screen</b> <b>Flaming</b> Creatures. Critic J. Hoberman and performer Penny Arcade saved Smith's belongings and had a restoration of the film made, a project which took five years. The New York Film Festival showed the film in 1991, and the Museum of the Moving Image included it in a 1997 retrospective of Smith's work.|$|R
6000|$|To repeat all the {{unimportant}} {{incidents of}} the night would be tedious. When Poyor returned from his first trip outside he built a fire near the stream, shielded the <b>flame</b> by a <b>screen</b> of boughs that the light might not be reflected from the entrance, and then, with the air of one who is accustomed to such work, set about catching [...] "chickens" [...] {{enough to make a}} hearty meal.|$|R
50|$|In 1968, Abe Fortas was {{nominated}} to be Chief Justice of the United States. Fortas had supported reversing the original convictions for <b>screening</b> <b>Flaming</b> Creatures, so Senator James Eastland, {{chairman of the}} Senate Judiciary Committee, requested that the print seized at the University of Michigan be sent to Washington. James Clancy, representing Citizens for Decent Literature, showed the film among other material, inviting senators to view what Fortas had held in several decisions did not constitute obscenity.|$|R
5000|$|A flicker {{light bulb}}, flicker flame light bulb or flicker glow lamp is a gas-discharge lamp which {{produces}} light by ionizing a gas, usually neon mixed with helium {{and a small}} amount of nitrogen gas, by an electric current passing through two <b>flame</b> shaped electrode <b>screens</b> coated with partially decomposed barium azide. The ionized gas moves randomly between the two electrodes which produces a flickering effect, often marketed as suggestive of a candle flame (see image).|$|R

50|$|Residential {{combustion}} {{water heaters}} manufactured since 2003 in the United States have been redesigned to resist ignition of flammable vapors and incorporate a thermal cutoff switch, per ANSI Z21.10.1. The first feature attempts to prevent vapors from flammable liquids and {{gases in the}} vicinity of the heater from being ignited and thus causing a house fire or explosion. The second feature prevents tank overheating due to unusual combustion conditions. These safety requirements were made in response to homeowners storing, or spilling, gasoline or other flammable liquids near their water heaters and causing fires. Since most of the new designs incorporate some type of <b>flame</b> arrestor <b>screen,</b> they require monitoring to make sure they do not become clogged with lint or dust, reducing the availability of air for combustion. If the flame arrestor becomes clogged, the thermal cutoff may act to shut down the heater.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} main stages inside the hall, {{with a smaller}} central stage {{designed}} for poets, performance artists, jugglers, dancers including The Tribe of the Sacred Mushroom), Philippine dancer David Medalla and The Exploding Galaxy Dance Troupe. The largest stage for the main events, constructed along the rear wall, was flanked by the large glass windows of the Palace. Light shows and strobes lit up every inch of available space from a massive light tower {{at the center of}} the hall. Underground films, (most notably the <b>Flaming</b> Creatures) were <b>screened</b> on white sheets taped to scaffolding. The center piece was a helter skelter which was rented for the night.|$|R
50|$|The {{benefits}} of a two-stage supercharger eventually became so clear that Allison did make some efforts in this direction. Allison attached an auxiliary supercharger in various configurations to the existing engine-mounted supercharger and carburetor. Early versions of these two-stage supercharger engines were used on the P-63. No intercooler, aftercooler, or backfire <b>screen</b> (<b>flame</b> trap) were incorporated into these two-stage V-1710 engines (except for the V-1710-119 used on the experimental P-51J, which had an aftercooler). The two-stage Merlin engines had all of these features, which were designed to prevent detonation from charge heating and backfire into the supercharger. The G-series V-1710s installed on the F-82 E/F/G models had only anti-detonation injection (ADI) {{to deal with these}} problems, and not surprisingly had severe reliability and maintenance problems. In one record, it was stated that the F-82 required 33 hours of maintenance for each hour of flight.|$|R
40|$|An {{screening}} method, {{comprised of}} straightforward sample treatment based on silica clean-up, GC Ã— GC-ToFMS detection and {{automated data processing}} with the non-proprietary free downloadable software MetAlignID, has been successfully validated with respect to false negatives for the sum PCB 28, 52, 101, 138, 153 and 180), for the sum of BDE 28, 47, 99, 100, 153, 154 and 183, for the four markers of PAHs and {{for a number of}} emerging brominated <b>flame</b> retardants. A <b>screening</b> detection limit (SDL) equal to or lower than the maximum regulatory level was always achieved. MetAlignID considerably decreased the time needed for data treatment from 20 to 5 min/file. Automated identification of the signature mass spectral patterns was applied to identify chlorinated- and brominated-containing substances with more than two halogen atoms, and PAH derivates. Although the success rate was variable and needs to be further improved, the tool was considered to be of added value. </p...|$|R
500|$|The show {{is mainly}} {{divided into four}} parts with the last part being the encore. The main show began with a video {{introduction}} called [...] "The Heart" [...] where Gaga appeared as alter-ego Candy Warhol. She was shown dressing up and displayed the symbol of a pink heart on her T-shirt and said [...] "My name is Lady Gaga, {{and this is my}} Haus". The video was projected on a giant screen in front of the stage. As the video approached towards the end, a countdown from ten to one happened, Gaga's face was shown wearing the video sunglasses, and <b>flames</b> engulfed the <b>screen</b> as it dropped. Gaga appeared {{in the middle of the}} stage being surrounded by her dancers holding glass encrusted plates which camouflage them. She wore a futuristic black dress in geometric patterns with a triangular piece on her right breast and peplum. DJ Space Cowboy was present at a corner, playing the backing music. Gaga came out in the center as the plates rolled around and started singing [...] "Paparazzi".|$|R
5000|$|The New Faces Team {{was created}} to offset the {{remaining}} top three characters. Their members were developed to be the Hero Team's counterparts; Chris manipulates fire like Kyo, Shermie uses lightning like Benimaru Nikaido and Yashiro Nanakase is a giant man like Goro Daimon. The plot element of Chris acting as Orochi's new body was developed since initial stages of production, but the staff had already thought of using other ideas. At the inception of production, the plan was for Chris to use the [...] "Flame of Darkness (Black Flame)," [...] but due to difficulties of seeing the black <b>flame</b> in the <b>screen</b> it was changed to the purple ones. The final boss character, Orochi, was first meant to be [...] "a buck-naked Chris" [...] fighting with a shining energy ball. However, it was opted to his current design after developers made a survey in which {{there were only two}} votes in favor of the first design. His design codename was [...] "Chief", but several people were against of giving him the name of [...] "Orochi".|$|R
5000|$|In 1872, George Brayton {{applied for}} a patent for his [...] "Ready Motor", a {{reciprocating}} constant-pressure engine. The engine was a two-stroke and produced power on every revolution. Brayton engines used a separate piston compressor and piston expander, with compressed air heated by internal fire as it entered the expander cylinder. The first versions of the Brayton engine were vapor engines which mixed fuel with air as it entered the compressor {{by means of a}} heated-surface carburetor. The fuel / air was contained in a reservoir / tank and then it was admitted to the expansion cylinder and burned. As the fuel/air mixture entered the expansion cylinder, it was ignited by a pilot <b>flame.</b> A <b>screen</b> was used to prevent the fire from entering or returning to the reservoir. In early versions of the engine, this screen sometimes failed and an explosion would occur. In 1874, Brayton solved the explosion problem by adding the fuel just prior to the expander cylinder. The engine now used heavier fuels such as kerosene and fuel oil. Ignition remained a pilot flame. Brayton produced and sold [...] "Ready Motors" [...] to perform a variety of tasks like water pumping, mill operation, running generators, and marine propulsion. The [...] "Ready Motors" [...] were produced from 1872 to sometime in the 1880s; several hundred such motors were likely produced during this time period. Brayton licensed the design to Simone in the UK. Many variations of the layout were used; some were single-acting and some were double-acting. Some had under walking beams; others had overhead walking beams. Both horizontal and vertical models were built. Sizes ranged from less than one to over 40 horsepower. Critics of the time claimed the engines ran smoothly and had a reasonable efficiency.|$|R
40|$|To address {{my first}} objective, I opportunistically {{collected}} road-killed bobcats (n= 44) throughout Illinois during 2013 - 2014, and analyzed their liver tissue {{for the presence}} of PCBs, PBDEs, and various other alternative halogenated flame retardants. Concentrations of âˆ‘PCBs ranged from 76. 4 ng/g lw to 3782 ng/g lw (median 562. 97 ng/g lw). Male bobcats had significantly higher concentrations of PCBs than females (p = 0. 04). Concentrations of âˆ‘PBDEs (including all detectable PBDE congeners) ranged from 8. 3 to 1920 ng/g lipid weight (median: 50. 3 ng/g lw). Among the alternative <b>flame</b> retardants <b>screened,</b> Dechloranes (including anti- and syn-Dechlorane Plus and Dechlorane- 602, 603, and 604), tetrabromo-o-chlorotoluene (TBCT), and hexabromocyclododecane (HBCD) were also detected frequently, with median concentrations of 28. 7, 5. 2, and 11. 8 ng/g lw, respectively. Dechlorane analogue compositions in bobcats were different from that reported in other studies, suggesting species- or analogue-dependent bioaccumulation, biomagnification, or metabolism of Dechlorane chemicals in different food webs. My findings, along with previously reported food web models, suggest Dechloranes may possess substantial bioaccumulation and biomagnification potencies in terrestrial mammalian food webs. Thus, attention should be given to these highly bioavailable flame retardants in future environmental biomonitoring and risk assessments in a post-PBDE era. 	To address my second objective I collected raccoons (n= 32) from various sites across Illinois and Missouri during 2013 - 2015. Liver tissues were analyzed {{for the presence of}} PBDEs and Dechloranes. âˆ‘PBDE concentrations ranged from 19. 1 ng/g lw to 2124 ng/g lw (median = 98. 0 ng/g lw) and did not differ between gender or age of raccoon. Although nonsignificant (p= 0. 06), adult raccoons appeared to have greater PBDE concentration loads compared to juveniles. These nonsignificant differences are likely due to large variation in contaminant concentrations, possibly reflecting differences in individual raccoon diet and behavior. 	This is the first study reporting bioaccumulation of halogenated flame retardants in a wild felid in North America, and also the first report of PBDE accumulation in North American raccoons. The wide detection of Dechloranes, HBCD and TBCT in bobcats suggests a broad exposure of these alternative flame retardants in terrestrial apex predators in terrestrial ecosystems. The comparatively high levels of PBDEs in raccoons also suggest that biota in terrestrial habitats are still widely exposed to and susceptible to the bioaccumulation of these flame retardants...|$|R
50|$|Some {{features}} that were removed {{in the second}} game were brought back in Golden Axe III. The mischievous gnomes from the original game who carried magic potions and food have returned in place of the enemy mages from the second game in the series. Extra lives can be earned by freeing a certain number of prisoners scattered throughout the levels. Some prisoners are trapped in barrels, or stuck in crystal cells; others are guarded by an enemy that must be slain in order to free them. The magic system returned to the original version from Golden Axe, with characters using all collected magic potions every time, rather than allowing the player to choose how much magic to use by charging the magic meter like in Golden Axe 2. The characters can use devastating new spells with combined casting. Each character does the same max magic damage. The mounts in Golden Axe 3 have turned into a hybrid snail-ostrich, instead of the chicken-leg or the dragon-raptors in the previous games. The mounts are known as Bizarrans. There are four types of Bizarrans in Golden Axe 3. The firewave Bizarran is a Red Dragon that fires a fast moving wave of <b>flame</b> across the <b>screen.</b> The purple Snail uses its tongue to attack, the green Snail is a more powerful version with a longer tongue, and the Green Dragon bites and throws enemies over its shoulder. Players are able to choose their own route to the golden axe. If the player reaches the last boss and they are not on their last continue they may get the good ending.|$|R
6000|$|... "You are not hurting {{me in the}} least," [...] he replied, {{with that}} change which came {{from time to time}} in his eyes as if the <b>flame</b> behind the <b>screen</b> had {{suddenly}} grown brighter. [...] "I agree with every word you say; the meanest church in the land should be cherished as long as it will hold together. But unfortunately ours had to come down. It was very old and decayed past mending. The floor was six feet below the level of the surrounding ground and frightfully damp. It had been examined over and over again by experts during the past forty or fifty years, and from the first they pronounced it a hopeless case, so that it was never restored. The interior, right down to the time of demolition, was like that of most country churches of a century ago, with the old black worm-eaten pews, in which the worshippers shut themselves up as if in their own houses or castles. On account of the damp we were haunted by toads. You smile, sir, but it was no smiling matter for me during my first year as vicar, when I discovered that it was the custom here to keep pet toads in the church. It sounds strange and funny, no doubt, but it is a fact that all the best people in the parish had one of these creatures, and it was customary for the ladies to bring it a weekly supply of provisions--bits of meat, hard-boiled eggs chopped up, and earth-worms, and whatever else they fancied it would like--in their reticules. The toads, I suppose, knew when it was Sunday--their feeding day; at all events they would crawl out of their holes in the floor under the pews to receive their rations--and caresses. The toads got on my nerves with rather unpleasant consequences. I preached in a way which my listeners did not appreciate or properly understand, particularly when I took for my subject our duty towards the lower animals, including reptiles." ...|$|R
