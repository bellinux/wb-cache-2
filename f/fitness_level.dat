500|$|He {{started the}} 2003–04 season at Rochdale, making 16 {{appearances}} and scoring five goals in League Two. Rochdale's new manager Steve Parkin criticised McEvilly's <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> {{to play and}} had described him as [...] "too heavy", and that he needed [...] "to get his physique down to an acceptable weight where he can get around the pitch". Conference National club Accrington Stanley signed McEvilly on a one-month loan in January 2004, making his debut in their 3–0 home win against Tamworth on 20 January. Despite playing out of position in wide right, McEvilly commented; [...] "I was playing out of position but it was okay". He went on to describe the drop in level he said; [...] "I have never played in the Conference but, from what I have seen, it is no different to Division Three." [...] After a month at Accrington and making three appearances scoring one goal, his loan was extended in February for a further month, with manager John Coleman praising him as [...] "a great acquisition to the squad". McEvilly went on to make a further three appearances, scoring once more before returning to Rochdale. On his return to Rochdale, he scored a further one goal in 14 appearances. At {{the end of the}} season, McEvilly was released by Rochdale on 10 May, signing a dater for Accrington Stanley on a permanent basis after a previous loan spell. On 13 November 2004, McEvilly scored a hat-trick in Accrington's 5–0 home victory over Northwich Victoria. During the 2004–05 season he made 39 appearances in the Conference National, scoring 15 goals.|$|E
40|$|Cardio{{respiratory}} {{fitness is}} the ability of the circulatory, respiratory and muscular systems to supply oxygen during sustained physical activity. Low cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> have been found in individuals with intellectual disabilities (ID), which puts them at higher risk for cardiovascular diseases and all-cause mortality. The aims of this review were to update previous reviews about (a) the cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> and their determinants in individuals with ID, and (b) the validity and reliability of cardiorespiratory fitness testing in individuals with ID. We searched the databases of Pubmed and Embase for relevant studies, resulting in 31 included articles. These studies mainly included younger participants with mild to moderate ID. Results confirmed previous findings of low cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> in individuals with ID. Cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> of children and adolescents with ID are already low, with further decline with increasing age. Furthermore, females have lower cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> than males. Physical inactivity and chronotropic incompetence are most likely to contribute to low cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels.</b> Peak cardiorespiratory <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> of individuals with ID can be assessed with maximal treadmill protocols, after allowing for familiarization sessions. Although, predicting maximal oxygen uptake from field tests is problematic, field tests have been found valid and reliable as indicators of cardiorespiratory fitness. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{purpose was}} to {{investigate}} the factors related to aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> of adolescents in southern Brazil. MethodsThe sample consisted of 1081 students (545 males and 536 females), with mean age of 12. 8 (± 1. 2) years. This is a cross-sectional epidemiological study. Aerobic fitness was assessed by the 9 -min running test. The independent variables analyzed were: age, socioeconomic status, school system (public/private), sedentary behavior, physical activity level, nutritional status and body adiposity. Analyses were stratified by sex. We used the Student “t” test for independent samples and logistic regression to estimate odds ratio (OR) and confidence intervals of 95 % (95 % CI). ResultsThe prevalence of low aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> was 92. 5 %. Boys aged 13 – 14 years were 2. 44 {{times more likely to have}} low aerobic fitness levels; poorer boys were 4. 31 times more likely to have low aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>levels.</b> Girls aged 13 – 14 years were 5. 35 times more likely to have low aerobic fitness levels; poorer girls were 10. 70 times more likely to have low aerobic fitness levels; girls with sedentary behavior were approximately 4 times more likely to have low aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>levels.</b> ConclusionThus, it was concluded that almost all adolescents show low aerobic <b>fitness</b> <b>levels,</b> which makes necessary effective interventions in the school environment with the promotion of sports and regular practice of physical activity...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the effects of {{participation}} in a supplemental aquatic fitness program on the physical fitness (muscular strength, cardiovascular endurance, and flexibility) of children with developmental disabilities who also participate in Special Olympics programming, as compared to children who participate in Special Olympics programming alone. Fourteen children with developmental disabilities who were active participants in Special Olympics programming participated in the study. Of the 14 children, six participated in a supplemental therapeutic aquatic exercise program in order to see if participation would increase physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels.</b> Participant physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> were assessed using the Brockport Physical Fitness Test. No significant gains in physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> were observed in the children who participated in Special Olympics programming alone. In addition, no significant gains were found in the children who participated in both Special Olympics programming and the aquatic program. This study suggests that physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> are not increased by regular Special Olympics programming. Consequently, a supplemental program to provide more physical activity and, therefore, increase physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> in children with developmental disabilities is still needed. However, the aquatics program used in this study in conjunction with Special Olympics programming also found no significant gains in physical fitness. A supplemental aquatic exercise program with increased frequency, duration, and intensity may still be effective although further research is needed to test this claim.   M. S...|$|R

40|$|In my {{previous}} study (Oishi, 2010), I have reported the changes of body growth and physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> {{of the junior}} {{high school students in}} the Kumamoto University. In this paper, I analyzed the body growth and the effects of daily sports activity on the physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> of the upper grade students of elementary school in the Kumamoto city. A total of 5092 students were divided into daily sports or non-sport group, and their sports test data for 1) hand grip strength, 2) side stepping, 3) shuttle running, and 4) 50 m running were analyzed and compared. The body height and weight were gradually increased in both male and female students during 4 th to 6 th grades, ranged 9 - 10 % and 26 - 29 %, respectively, with the significant increment by 10 - 50 % of four sports test data in both students. These data suggested that the increase in body height and weight contributed to the enhancement of physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels.</b> The physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> were gradually increased by 21 - 35 % in both the daily sports and non-sport groups, but the levels were significantly higher in the daily sports group than the non-sport. Collectively these data suggested that the physical <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> for the upper grade students of the elementary school were gradually increased even in the non-sport students, but the daily sports activity enhanced the levels more in the daily sports group than non-sport students...|$|R
2500|$|Ledley {{has been}} {{described}} as having a terrific engine. This is because of his high <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> and work rate. He works equally hard in defence as attack and always looks to win the ball off the opposition, while he is also able to contribute goals to his team going forward. He is comfortable on the ball and is a decent passer. He is also a very physical player. Ledley has been criticised for not being a very quick player, [...] some critics have suggested that several Premier League clubs who were interested in him may have been put off by his lack of pace. However, John Hartson has said that pace is not necessarily the most important thing, especially when Ledley is good in so many other aspects of the game. He has also said that he thinks Ledley would be able to play in the Premier League and compared his style of play to that of players like Xabi Alonso and Frank Lampard.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> of a {{human body}} in {{training}} {{can be broken down}} into four periods: initial fitness, parietal fitness training, recovery, and supercompensation. During the initial fitness period, the target of the training has a base level of fitness (shown by the first time sector in the graph). Upon entering the training period, the target's level of fitness decreases (shown by the second time sector in the graph). After training, the body enters the recovery period during which level of fitness increases up to the initial <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> (shown by the third time sector in the graph). Because the human body is an adjustable organism, it will feel the need to adjust itself to a higher level of fitness in anticipation of the next training session. Accordingly, the increase in fitness following a training session does not stop at the initial <b>fitness</b> <b>level.</b> Instead the body enters a period of supercompensation during which fitness surpasses the initial <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> (shown by the fourth time sector in the graph). If there are no further workouts, this <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> will slowly decline back towards the initial <b>fitness</b> <b>level</b> (shown by the last time sector in the graph). First put forth by Russian scientist Nikolai N. Yakovlev (1911-1992) in 1949-1959, this theory is a basic principle of athletic training.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Deterioration of the {{hippocampus}} occurs in elderly indi-viduals {{with and without}} dementia, yet individual variation exists in the degree and rate of hippocampal decay. Determining {{the factors that influence}} individual variation in the magnitude and rate of hippocampal decay may help promote lifestyle changes that prevent such deteriora-tion from taking place. Aerobic fitness and exercise are effective at pre-venting cortical decay and cognitive impairment in older adults and epi-demiological studies suggest that physical activity can reduce the risk for developing dementia. However, the relationship between aerobic fit-ness and hippocampal volume in elderly humans is unknown. In this study, we investigated whether individuals with higher <b>levels</b> of aerobic <b>fitness</b> displayed greater volume of {{the hippocampus}} and better spatial memory performance than individuals with lower <b>fitness</b> <b>levels.</b> Further-more, in exploratory analyses, we assessed whether hippocampal vol-ume mediated the relationship between fitness and spatial memory. Using a region-of-interest analysis on magnetic resonance images in 165 nondemented older adults, we found a triple association such that higher <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> were associated with larger left and right hippo-campi after controlling for age, sex, and years of education, and larger hippocampi and higher <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> were correlated with better spatial memory performance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that hippocampal volume partially mediated the relationship between higher <b>fitness</b> <b>levels</b> and enhanced spatial memory. Our results clearly indicate that higher <b>levels</b> of aerobic <b>fitness</b> are associated with increased hippocampal volume in older humans, which translates to better memory function...|$|R
