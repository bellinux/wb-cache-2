40|$|Simulation of soil {{moisture}} content requires effective soil hydraulic parameters that are valid at the modelling scale. This study investigates how these parameters can be estimated by inverse modelling using {{soil moisture}} measurements at 25 locations at three different depths (at the surface, at 30 and 60 cm depth) on an 80 by 20 m hillslope. The study presents two global sensitivity analyses to investigate the sensitivity in simulated {{soil moisture content}} of the different hydraulic parameters used in a one-dimensional unsaturated zone model based on Richards' equation. For estimation of the effective parameters the shuffled complex evolution algorithm is applied. These estimated parameters are compared to their measured laboratory and in situ equivalents. Soil hydraulic functions were estimated in the laboratory on 100 cm(3) undisturbed soil cores collected at 115 locations situated in two horizons in three profile pits along the hillslope. Furthermore, in situ field saturated hydraulic conductivity was estimated at 120 locations using single-ring pressure infiltrometer measurements. The sensitivity analysis of 13 soil physical parameters (saturated hydraulic conductivity (K-s), saturated moisture content (theta(s)), residual moisture content (theta(r)), inverse of the air-entry value (alpha), van Genuchten shape parameter (n), Averjanov shape parameter (N) for both <b>horizons,</b> and depth (<b>d)</b> from surface to B horizon) in a two-layer single column model showed that the parameter N is the least sensitive parameter. K-s of both horizons, theta(s), of the A <b>horizon</b> and <b>d</b> {{were found to be}} the most sensitive parameters. Distributions over all locations of the effective parameters and the distributions of the estimated soil physical parameters from the undisturbed soil samples and the single-ring pressure infiltrometer estimates were found significantly different at a 5 % level for all parameters except for alpha of the A horizon and K-s and theta(s) of the B horizon. Different reasons are discussed to explain these large differences. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Systematical archaeological {{excavations}} at {{the site}} Gamzigrad - Felix Romuliana continued in 2007 - 2008 in the south-eastern part of the fortified imperial palace, in {{the section of the}} thermae according to the plan of archaeological research for this site (2005 - 2009). In 2007, squares L'XXIV, M'XXIV, M'XXIH and M'XXII, which were investigated in 2005 to the horizon c, dated {{to the end of the}} 5 th and the beginning of the 6 th centuries, were completely excavated to the level of the porch of the earlier fortification of Romuliana (Plan 1). The stratigraphy of the cultural layers in these squares is as follows (Fig. 1) : Below horizon c there is a layer of construction rubble mixed with brownish-yellow, clay like, sandy soil, 50 - 75 cm thick, comprising the finds dated in the last quarter of the 4 th- 5 th centuries, layer D; The level of layer D is <b>horizon</b> <b>d,</b> where a structure destroyed in a conflagration, house 1 / 07, was discovered in squares M'XXII and M'XXIII. It could be dated, on the basis of the preserved household (pottery, metal and antler items, coins, etc.), from the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th century; <b>Horizon</b> <b>d</b> 1 is a mortar floor discovered beneath <b>horizon</b> <b>d,</b> which presents the earlier phase of house 1 / 07; <b>Horizon</b> <b>d</b> 2 is the earliest mortar floor inside the house 1 / 07, covered with a later mortar floor (<b>horizon</b> <b>d</b> 1) and a levelling layer of yellow sand and gravel, which comprises the finds dating also to the last quarter of the 4 th to the middle of the 5 th centuries; Layer E, 15 - 40 cm thick, is below <b>horizon</b> <b>d,</b> comprising dark brown soil with rubble and lenses of soot at the bottom, together with finds dated to the second half of the 4 th century; Horizon e is covered with layer E, and spread across all the squares which were investigated to the south and to the east of Galerius' bath, where 8 large postholes, which outlined a space 7 x 3 m large and probably some kind of porch, were found along with two furnaces and two pits; Layer F, about 30 cm thick, is the substructure of horizon e and it comprises crushed stone and pebbles mixed with lime mortar, and in places has a levelling of reddish-brown sand. Finds here were dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries; Horizon f is a mortar floor of the later fortification of Felix Romuliana at a level of 184. 75 m in the west and 184. 55 m in the east (an average level of 184. 64 m), which was interrupted by a trench running in an east-west direction along the southern section of squares L'-M'XXIV. The trench was filled with soot, small rubble and reddish-brown sand and comprised a large amount of artifacts, such as pottery and glass fragments, metal and bone items and coins dated to the second half of the 3 rd century (Fig. 4). Layer G consists of dark brown and yellowish-brown clay with small rubble and soot. It was a levelling layer above the intense construction rubble from the previous horizon and a substructure of horizon f. This layer comprised archaeological finds dated to the end of the 3 rd and the first half of the 4 th centuries and to the prehistoric period (Early Iron Age); Horizon g is a mortar floor of the porch of the southern and eastern rampart of the earlier fortification of Romuliana. 4 pillars of the eastern porch (pillars 1 - 4, discovered in 2004 - 2005), a corner pillar in an L-shape (pillar 5) and one pillar of the southern porch (pillar 6) have been ascertained. From this level the water and sewage canals were dug (Fig. 5). In squares K'XXII-XXIII a trench, measuring 4 x 2 m, in an east-west direction, was opened which aimed to investigate the layers beneath the Roman horizon g. The stratigraphy in this trench is as follows: - Layer G at a level of about 184. 53 m; - Layer H, about 35 cm thick, is greenish-yellow clay in which Roman canals were buried, comprising the fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery and fragments of reddish rammed earth (Fig. 2); Layer I, about 20 cm thick, is greenish-brown clay, comprising the scarce fragments of the Early and Late Iron Age pottery; Virgin soil consists of yellow clay starting from a level of 184. 00 m in the west and of 183. 60 m in the east. In 2008, the remains of an earlier building were discovered beneath the floor of the apodyterium of Galerius' bath found in 2002 and below the foundation of the sudatorium and the tepidarium of the same structure, which were found in 2005. Also, for the purposes of conservation and restoration of the thermae, an apsidal room next to the west wall of the apodyterium, so called 'Galerius' dressing room', was completely filled with construction rubble, among which was found a part of an abraded vault (Fig. 6). Excavations proved that the apsidal room had been a pool with cold water, a frigidarium, which was twice renovated and was decorated with mosaic made of black, white and grey stone cubes (Fig. 7). The phases of reconstruction of the frigidarium could also be noticed in its eastern wall (Fig. 8). Also in the rubble inside the pool, glass mosaic cubes of deep blue and golden colours were discovered, indicating the decoration of the vault. In the latest phase, two pillars were constructed to carry the stairs made of stone slabs (Fig. 8). The earliest phase of this room, which had a rectangular layout and a mortar floor, could be part of the building dating back to before Galerius' bath (Plan 2). During the cleaning of the eastern wall of the frigidarium, a semicircular niche with a fresco decoration of geometrical and figural motives, painted in black, dark red, orange and blue on an ochre surface, was discovered (Fig. 3). Under Galerius' bath, a large earlier building was investigated (trenches 1 - 5 / 08). Only its foundation zone is preserved. The walls of the Imperial bath were founded on the earlier walls, which were 0. 65 m thick and had foundations which were 0. 90 m thick (Plan 2). The pilaster of the west faeade of the thermae was also founded on the earlier wall, but it destroyed a water canal (canal A discovered inside the south room of Galerius' bath in 2004), which was constructed after the earlier structure and before the Imperial bath (Fig. 9). It is interesting that the part of the earlier building to the west of the thermae was not demolished during the construction of the Imperial residence. It was adapted and incorporated into the plan of the fortified palace. The original construction was a large public building, probably theprincipia, with a row of rooms around a large courtyard, the atrium. The entrance, which had a porch and a pylon with two square towers and thresholds made of stone slabs, was in the north. (Figs. 10 - 14) Previously, this building was mistakenly dated to the 4 th- 5 th centuries, because it had been reused in Late Roman and Early Byzantine periods. (Figs. 15 - 18) However, based on the results of the new research, it could be dated to the 3 rd century. ...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY. The {{behaviour}} of 25 {{major and}} trace elements, together with mineral changes, has been examined {{in a deep}} weathering profile on the Cammenellis granite, Cornwall. The bulk chemical and mineralogical composition ofthe regolith shows only minor changes from the parent rock indicat-ing a low degree of chemical weathering. However, within the regolith marked differences occur between the fine fractions from the various horizons. Chlorite and degraded muscovite characterize the fines of horizons A+B and C whereas gibbsite and kaolinite characterize <b>horizon</b> <b>D.</b> Secondary minerals becoming base deficient with depth is the reverse of normal behaviour and two possible theories are advanced to explain this anomaly. Most of the trace elements are concentrated in the < lo t~m fraction of the various horizons, in part by an association with degraded muscovite. Tin and Zr occur in resistates and Be, St, and Co are mainly lost during weathering. A CONSIDERABLE amount of {{work has been done}} in an attempt o elucidate the nature of the weathering process and the controls upon it but relatively little of it has been from the geochemical point of view.

We particularly look at the Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) network {{which has been the}} most used of ANNs architectures both in the renewable energy domain and in the time series forecasting. We have used a MLP and an ad hoc time series pre-processing to develop a methodology for the daily prediction of global solar radiation on a horizontal surface. First results are promising with nRMSE not, vert, similar 21 % and RMSE not, vert, similar 3. 59 MJ/m 2. The optimized MLP presents predictions similar to or even better than conventional and reference methods such as ARIMA techniques, Bayesian inference, Markov chains and k-Nearest-Neighbors. Moreover we found that the data pre-processing approach proposed can reduce significantly forecasting errors of about 6 % compared to conventional prediction methods such as Markov chains or Bayesian inference. The simulator proposed has been obtained using 19 years of available data from the meteorological station of Ajaccio (Corsica Island, France, 41 ° 55 ′N, 8 ° 44 ′E, 4 m above mean sea level).

40|$|Karst {{aquifers}} {{are those}} that contain dissolution-generated conduits that permit the rapid transport of ground water, often in turbulent flow. The conduit system receives localized inputs from sinking surface streams and as storm runoff through sinkholes. The conduit system interconnects with the ground water stored in fractures and in the granular permeability of the bedrock. As a conceptual framework, the basic components of karstic aquifers seem to be generally accepted. Progress in {{the decade of the}} 1990 s has focused mainly on quantifying the conceptual model. The equilibrium chemistry of the limestone and dolomite dissolution has been reliably established, and there are formal models for the kinetics of dissolution. Kinetic models have been used to calculate both fracture enlargement to protoconduits (0. 01 -m aperture) and the enlargement of protoconduits to the size of typical cave passages. Modeling of ground water flow in karstic aquifers has been less successful. Progress has been made in the use of water budgets, tracer studies, hydrograph analysis and chemograph analysis for the characterization of karstic aquifers. Topics on which progress is needed include (a) the construction of models that describe the complete aquifer including the interactions of all components, (b) models for clastic sediment transport within the aquifer, and (c) working out processes and mechanisms for contaminant transport in karst aquifers. An optimistic assessment {{at the end of the}} millennium is that a complete model for karstic aquifers is visible on the <b>horizon.</b> <b>D</b> 2002 Elsevier Science B. V.

It incorporates the results of oil exploration activities in the area since 1967 : this involved the drilling of 17 boreholes (43 000 m) and the recording of about 24 000 line km of seismic reflection profiles. A structural investigation was facilitated by regional mapping of two key seismic reflectors; these are acoustic basement (<b>horizon</b> <b>D</b> at tile base of the Mesozoic) and a prominent reflector and unconformable horizon (horizon C) within the Lower Cretaceous. An additional two horizons were mapped over part of the Agulhas Bank; they are horizons A (base of the Uppper Cretaceous) and 11 (within the Lower Cretaceous). These reflector horizons were tied to stratigraphic control points in the boreholes. A stratigraphic framework was erected and correlations were established by means of a study of borehole cuttings samples, cores and sidewall cores and a variety of wireline logs. The existing Mesozoic litho-stratrigraphic framework was supplemented by defining reference stratotypes for the Swart¬kops end Sundays River formations. Subsurface stratotypes are defined for two new units; they are termed the Infanta and Alphard Formations. A subsurface reference stratotype for the Alexandria Formation is presented. A chronostratigrapic framework and correlations, which became available through a study of microfauna and microflora were intergrated with structural and lithostratigraphic information. As a consequence four litho-tectonic units are recognised; their evolution is discussed also in terms of varying rates of sediment accumulation.

40|$|This volume {{consists}} of papers presented at a 1996 conference. Its professed remit, to contribute an internationally and chronologically wide-ranging {{discussion on the}} nature of urban decline across Europe from Roman to Reformation times, raises high expectations. And the book does indeed embrace many parts of Europe and includes some extremely useful regional overviews. Especially notable are Roger White s summary reinterpretation of possible archaeological continuities into post-Roman times at the Roman city-site at Wroxeter in England; a valuable discussion of the changing fortunes of the civitas capitals of late antique Gaul by S. T. Loseby; an illuminating tour <b>d</b> <b>horizon</b> of the cities of the central Danube region between 100 and 1600 provided by Peter Csendes; and, in the most distinguished essay of the volume, an original and deeply considered discussion of the interconnections between decolonization and urban change in Ireland between 1300 and 1550 by its leading medieval urban historian, Howard Clarke. ...|$|R
40|$|The U(1) gauge {{dynamics}} on a D 4 -brane is revisited, with a two form, {{to construct}} an effective curvature theory in a second order formalism. We exploit the local degrees in a two form, and modify its dynamics in a gauge invariant way, to incorporate a non-perturbative metric fluctuation in an effective D 4 -brane. Interestingly, the near <b>horizon</b> <b>D</b> 4 -brane is shown to describe an asymptotic Anti de Sitter (AdS) in a semi-classical regime. Using Weyl scaling(s), we obtain the emergent rotating geometries leading to primordial de Sitter (dS) and AdS vacua in a quantum regime. Under a discrete transformation, we re-arrange the mixed dS patches to describe a Schwazschild-like dS (SdS) and a topological-like dS (TdS) black holes. We analyze SdS vacuum for Hawking radiations to arrive at Nariai geometry, where a discrete torsion forms a condensate. We perform thermal analysis to identify Nariai vacuum with a TdS. Investigation reveals an AdS patch within a thermal dS brane, which may provide a clue to unfold dS/CFT. In addition, the role of dark energy, sourced by a discrete torsion, in the dS vacua is investigated using Painleve geometries. It is argued that a D-instanton pair is created by a discrete torsion, with a Big Bang/Crunch, at the past horizon in a pure dS. Nucleation, of brane/anti-brane pair(s), is qualitatively analyzed {{to construct an}} effective space-time on a D 4 -brane and its anti brane. Analysis re-assures the significant role played by a non-zero mode, of NS-NS two form, to generalize the notion of branes within a brane. Comment: 47 pages, 4 figure...|$|E
40|$|The Caerwys tufa in North Wales (UK) {{contains}} basal deposits {{thought to}} represent carbonate precipitation during the Late-glacial interstadial. These deposits {{are used to}} test whether stable isotope data record {{all or part of}} a warming-cooling-warming trend through the transition of the Late-glacial interstadial, Younger Dryas stadial and early Holocene. The d 18 O values and molluscan abundance data suggest that deposition of the Late-glacial tufa occurred mainly during a relatively warm period (? GL- 1 c or 1 e) followed by cooling, the latter likely to be the transition into the Younger Dryas stadial. Tufa deposition is not recorded in the coldest part of the stadial: it is replaced by a sandy <b>horizon.</b> <b>d</b> 13 C values around - 8. 5 ‰ in the basal Late-glacial interstadial tufas show there was a significant influence from isotopically light soil-zone CO 2, consistent with development of birch scrub and woodland further south in North Wales. During climatic cooling into the Younger Dryas stadial a 1 ‰ decrease in tufa d 13 C is interpreted to represent decreasing phytoplankton photosynthetic activity in pools causing less isotopic enrichment of the tufa d 13 C. In the (pre- 9000 cal. years BP) early Holocene tufas at Caerwys, palaeo-water temperatures calculated from d 18 O in tufa calcite and from shell carbonate of Lymnaea peregra agree well and suggest summer water temperatures in the range 13 to 16. 5 °C. d 13 C data from these early Holocene pool-micrite tufas demonstrate that phytoplanktonic photosynthetic activity within the water column resumed under the warmer conditions causing isotopic enrichment of the tufa d 13 C values...|$|E
40|$|Laboratory {{measurements}} on sediment samples and density well logs run at DSDP Site 534 in the Blake-Bahama Basin {{were used to}} establish an in situ velocity and density structure. Synthetic seismograms were generated for comparison to reprocessed seismic reflection data {{in the vicinity of}} the Site. Uncertainties in the relative positions of the hole and seismic reflection data, velocity corrections, and the composition of the unrecovered section were evaluated. In light of the errors and compressed section, no unique correlation of the seismic reflection data to the drill hole is completely defensible either in this chapter or elsewhere. The preferred correlation resulting from this exercise is as follows, with the Site 534 report correlation shown in parentheses where different. Horizon beta', 887 m; Horizon beta, 950 m (975 m); Horizon C, 1202 m (1250 m); Horizon C, 1268 m (1340 m); Horizon D', 1342 m (1432 m); <b>Horizon</b> <b>D,</b> 1550 m (1552 m). The major differences in these correlations arise from the use of slightly different velocities and hole location relative to the seismic profiles. The Site 534 report results rely on hole placement on a basement flank, whereas in this chapter we locate it within a basement depression still within the uncertainty of the navigation. The Site 534 report also uses drilling rates, CDP velocity analyses, sonobuoy data, and previous similar drilling correlation methods used at Site 391, along with other geologic considerations in arriving at differing results. Although the correlation method used in this investigation is more objective and the hole location uncertainties better defined, in order to have confidence in any results we will require drilling in areas where reflections are either more widely spaced or where we have better vertical velocity control in the hole...|$|E
40|$|Modifications of soil {{physical}} parameters (bulk density, {{pore space}} pattern and clay dispersibility) induced by compaction in wheel-rutted areas due to mechanized forest exploitation was studied in loamy soils developed under beech {{stands in the}} loessic belt of middle Belgium. The consequences of surface waterlogging on pedological processes (especially the geochemical behaviour of iron and aluminium) were also investigated. The results show that rutted areas have: (1) a significant decrease of total porosity in the eluvial upper layers of the soil (0 - 30 cm depth), associated with an important lowering of the transmission pore volume {{and a decrease in}} macroporosity to about 6 % of the total soil volume, i. e. to less than the current threshold value for root viability (10 %); (2) a reduction of macropore space to about 9. 5 % in the lower illuvial horizons (30 - 50 cm depth); (3) a decrease of redox potential due to temporary waterlogging, inducing (a) the occurrence of reduced forms of iron, (b) a strong leaching of iron oxyhydroxides from the E(g) to the B(1 g) horizon, (c) an increase of organically complexed iron forms in both the Es and B(tg) <b>horizons,</b> and (<b>d)</b> high solubility of Goethite and even of ferromagnesium minerals in the eluvial horizons; (4) an increase of clay dispersibility in both the E(g) and B(tg) horizons. These results provide clear evidence that on loessic materials soil compaction due to logging operations leads to rapid soil degradation through active hydromorphic processes.

40|$|EGU General Assembly 2015, held 12 - 17 April, 2015 in Vienna, Austria. id. 1200 The {{replacement}} of native beech forests (Fagus sylvatica) by Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) afforestation may exert changes in soil properties, particularly in {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) (Carceller and Vallejo, 1996). Stable isotopic signatures of light elements (d 13 C, d 15 N) in soils and plants are valuable proxies for the identification of biogeochemical processes and their rates in the pedosphere (Andreeva et al., 2013 and refs therein). In this work the C and N stable isotopic analysis {{is used as a}} proxy to detect changes in SOM surrogated to the effect of centennial {{replacement of}} beech by the Scots pinewood. Two acid soil profiles, developed on quartzites under a humid climate at an altitude of 1400 - 1500 masl, have been sampled in Moncayo (Iberian range, NE-Spain). For each soil profile three O-layers (litter: OL, fragmented litter OF and humified litter OH) and mineral soil horizons (Ah, E, Bhs and C) were sampled. Content and bulk isotopic signature of light elements (C and N) were analysed in a Flash 2000 elemental micro-analyser coupled via a ConFlo IV interface to a Delta V Advantage isotope ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) (Thermo Scientific, Bremen, Germany). Isotopic ratios are reported as parts per thousand deviations from appropriate standards. The standard deviations of d 13 C and d 15 N were typically less than 0. 05 per thousand, 0. 2 per thousand, respectively. After 100 years since the pine afforestation, no differences on C content were observed in the O-layers, ranging from 30 - 47 % in pine soils and 37 - 47 % in beech soils. Similarly, no differences on N content were observed in the O-layers, ranging from 1. 24 - 1. 86 % in pine soils and 1. 70 - 1. 71 % in beech soils. C and N contents decrease progressively in depth with the exception of E-horizons where the lowest C and N content values were found. C/N ratio is higher in pine soil (20. 7 - 38. 1) than in beech O soil horizons (21. 8 - 27. 5), showing similar behavior with soil depth. Pine biomass was slightly enriched in 13 C as compared to that from beech (OL enrichment factor= 1. 24 0. 13 per thousand). Along the soil profile the C isotopic signature (d 13 C) reflects the main vegetation signature being higher in pine than beech in the organic soil horizons (OL, OF and OH) down to the first mineral Ah horizon. At deeper <b>horizons</b> <b>d</b> 13 C value tends to equal that of the original beech soil indicating a limited influence of the afforested specie with depth even 100 years after afforestation. A consistent enrichment in d 15 N with depth was observed in the two profiles. This N enrichments have been related with progressive N losses being particularly pronounced in forest soils (Szpak, 2014 and refs therein). This phenomenon can be also related to migrations of N forms in a more evolved organic matter. In this view N losses in organic layers under beech seem to be less pronounced that under the alien pine.

40|$|Recently it {{has shown}} that Einstein’s field {{equations}} can be rewritten into a form of the {{first law of thermodynamics}} both at event horizon of static spherically symmetric black holes and apparent horizon of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker (FRW) universe, which indicates intrinsic thermodynamic properties of spacetime horizon. In the present paper we deal with the socalled f(R) gravity, whose action {{is a function of the}} curvature scalar R. In the setup of static spherically symmetric black hole spacetime, we find that at the event horizon, the field equations of f(R) gravity can be written into a form dE = TdS − PdV + Td ¯ S, where T is the Hawking temperature and S = Af ′(R) / 4 G is the horizon entropy of the black hole, E is the horizon energy of the black hole, P is the radial pressure of matter, V is the volume of black hole <b>horizon,</b> and <b>d</b> ¯ S can be interpreted as the entropy production term due to nonequilibrium thermodynamics of spacetime. In the setup of FRW universe, the field equations can also be cast to a similar form, dE = TdS + WdV + Td ¯ S, at the apparent horizon, where W = (ρ − P) / 2, E is the energy of perfect fluid with energy density ρ and pressure P inside the apparent horizon. Compared to the case of Einstein’s general relativity, an additional term d ¯ S also appears here. The appearance of the additional term is consistent with the argument recently given by Eling et al. (gr-qc/ 0602001) that the horizon thermodynamics is non-equilibrium one for the f(R) gravity...|$|R
