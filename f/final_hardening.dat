40|$|Abstract- SASOL is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of synthetic fuel from coal and natural gas in South Africa and due to its exothermal nature require the intake of water from natural resources. Large volumes of raw water are consumed and brines (saline/salty effluents) are produced {{as a consequence of}} re-use operations, many of which are currently disposed of in the fly ash system. South Africa is a water scarce country, therefore vigilant management of its water resources is vital and it was decided in the 1980 ’s to design the largest SASOL facility in Secunda as a zero effluent discharge complex. This design philosophy and sequential process alterations gave rise to an accumulation of salts within the current fly ash disposal system, which in turn is posing significant environmental risks. Preliminary research in mixing fly ash with different process brines to a high solids paste illustrated that the mixture hardens over time and more importantly proved that the <b>final</b> <b>hardened</b> product presented very low water permeability. Leaching tests indicated that the final product will not allow excessive ingress of salts to the soil and surface water resources in close complex proximity. It is exactly these physical properties that make the material attractive as a capping media for existing fly ash dams while simultaneously providing a sustainable salt sinking media to the wider SASOL processes. The work presented focuses on the process development aspect of the proposed process as the pasting of industrial brine and fly ash remains to be a novel concept. Attention was paid to the development of preliminary flow sheets, the selection of the more suitable flow scheme and appropriate methodology elaboration into the flow sheet selection.

40|$|A {{detailed}} microstructural {{analysis was}} conducted {{on a series of}} radial shell samples extracted from commercially produced centrifugally spin casted high-speed steel (HSS) work rolls for finishing hot strip mills (HSM). The systematic microstructural analysis was coupled with a numerical and experimental investigation to improve the life of HSS rolls. An integrated computational-experimental approach was developed to optimize the response of the HSS roll material that permitted the enhancement of the microstructure and properties of the HSS roll shell layer. Local continuous microstructural transformations through the thickness of the shell: carbide formation, precipitation, dissolution sequence and phase changes, were studied in great details. The analyses were conducted with the aid of advanced metallographic and experimental methods, finite-element (FE) analysis, and using commercial software systems to conduct thermodynamic-kinetics predictions. In order to analyze a response of the HSS roll to the hardening heat treatment (HT) and to control stress-strain evolution, a 3 -D FE model was developed of the composite structure of the roll. The multilayered model considers nonlinear material properties of each individual layer as a function of temperature, based on measured chemical composition gradients through the HSS shell. Transient coupled thermal-stress analysis was performed, using actual measured surface temperatures as boundary conditions (BC) for the FE model. The allowable thermal stress-strain levels were established and compared with a) thermodynamically predicted high temperature mechanical properties and b) room temperature test results of the shear strengths for the shell, bonding and core. In addition, sub-structuring and image-based processing techniques were implemented to aid {{in the development of a}} meso-scale FE model to simulate the local response of a given microstructural constituents and matrix under particular thermal conditions. The fundamental interpretation of multilayered structure and multi-scale approach help to understand the kinetics phenomena associated with continuous local microstructural transformations due to nonlinear heat transfer. The results from the microstructural observations were in good agreement with the numerical predictions. The major impact of this work clearly indicated that a refined as-cast structure prior to the heat treatment promoted an increased precipitation of carbides during <b>final</b> <b>hardening,</b> which greatly improved strength and performance. A non-conventional HT was defined and implemented in order to provide an additional degree of microstructural pre-conditioning, which homogenized the matrix throughout the HSS shell. The new HT defined the austenitization temperatures and times to modify the morphology of brittle interdendritic eutectic carbide networks and, hence, facilitating the kinetics of dissolution of these carbides. This behavior caused an increase in the solute content of the matrix. As a result, the matrix hardness and strength were increased during subsequent hardening HT in comparison to the conventional HT routes used for as-cast HSS rolls.

40|$|Apatitic calcium {{phosphate}} cements (CPCs) {{have been widely}} used as bone grafts due to their excellent osteoconductive properties, but the degradation properties are insufficient to stimulate bone healing in large bone defects. A novel approach to overcome the lack of degradability of apatitic CPC involves the development of biphasic CPCs (BCPC) based on tri{{calcium phosphate}} (TCP) in both alpha- and beta-polymorphs. The aim of the current study was to prepare and analyze the physicochemical properties of BCPCs based on dual phase alpha/beta-TCP as obtained by heat treatment of pure alpha-TCP. The handling and mechanical characteristics of the samples as well as the degradation behavior under in vitro condition were investigated and compared with a standard monophasic alpha-TCP-based CPC. The results showed that different heat treatments of commercially available alpha-TCP allowed the formation of biphasic calcium phosphate powder with a variety of alpha/beta-TCP ratios. The use of biphasic powder particles as a reactant for CPCs resulted into increased setting and injectability times of the <b>final</b> BCPCs. During <b>hardening</b> of the cements, the amount of apatite formation decreased with increasing beta-TCP content in the biphasic precursor powders. The morphology of the monophasic CPC consisted of plate-like crystals, whereas needle-like crystals were observed for BCPCs. In vitro degradation tests demonstrated that dissolution rate and corresponding calcium release from the set cements increased considerably with increasing beta-TCP content, suggesting that apatitic CPCs can be rendered degradable by using biphasic alpha/beta-TCP as powder precursor phase.

One of the main tasks of researchers was to transform industrial wastes to materials, which are not hazardous to the environment and harmful to the human health. According to Latvian policy of waste recycling, which are based on EC legislation of waste processing and disposal, where is written: “pollutant is paying”, Latvian producers are starting to take part in those activities. In reality, the deposition and storage of industrial wastes is very expensive procedure, and the taxes are increasing even more yearly. Industrial producers are interested to use wastes as a raw material for production of new products, which could be competitive in Latvian market. Waste, which comes from recycling process of alumina scrap metals, normally is used in building industry in Europe for production of specific building materials.

The evolution of the process - from the precursor dissolution to the <b>final</b> geopolymer matrix <b>hardening</b> - of different geopolymers containing a waste amount ranging from 3 to 20 %wt and their capability to inertize chromium cations were studied by: i) the leaching tests, according to the EN 12, 457 regulation, at different curing times (15, 28, 90 and 540 days) monitoring releases of chromium ions (Cr(III) and Cr(VI)) and the cations constituting the aluminosilicate matrix (Na, Si, Al); ii) the humidity variation for different curing times (15 and 540 days); iii) SEM characterization at different curing times (28 and 540 days); iv) the trend of the solution conductivity and pH during the leaching test; v) the characterization of the short-range ordering in terms of TOT bonds (where T is Al or Si) by 29 Si and 27 Al solid state magic-angle spinning nuclear magnetic resonance (ss MAS NMR) for geopolymers containing high amounts of waste (10 - 20 %wt).

40|$|The {{demand for}} weight {{reduction}} in automobiles {{to reduce fuel consumption}} pushed the spring manufacturer to choose higher-strength martensitic steels {{to reduce the}} resisting section of the wire, and for this reason the weight of the spring.

Another approach is the cold forming process wherein the wire is heat treated before the spring is formed to improve its formability. In both cases the coiled spring has to be hardened and tempered to reach the target strength. Energy and time consumption due to the final heat treatment slow production and increase the manufacturing cost of the spring. The two-fold target of shortening the process cycle and reducing the weight of the spring was met successfully in cold forming the material in its <b>final</b> condition (<b>hardened</b> and tempered). In this case the coiling process becomes more critical because the formability of these high-strength martensitic steels is not very high. The trend of using high-strength steels (between 1800 and 2100 MPa) increases the difficulties in the cold forming of such wires and can lead to the failure of the coiled wire caused by the breakage of the spring. 1 - 3 The forming forces required in the coiling of the wire increase with the high strength of the material causing the feeding force to also increase. The feeding rolls should provide enough force to avoid the slip of the wire between the rolls. For this reason the friction between the wire and the feeding rolls should be at a high level to provide enough tangential force to avoid any slip of the wire. On the other hand, high friction increases the required forming force due to the higher contribution of friction forces developing in the stationary dies where the wire slides as in the guiding plate, in the bending die and in the bar controlling the axial pitch of the spring. The contribution made by the bending die can be reduced using two bending rolls where the sliding friction is substituted by a prevalent rolling friction. This solution has been successfully used by spring manufacturers, who still face the problem of friction in the remaining components of the coiling machine: in the feeding system the friction should be high and elsewhere should be low. The insertion of a lubricating station between feeding and forming can solve the problem, but can be difficult in the industrial application, generating a dirty area of the press and requiring a cleaning step after coiling to remove residual lubricant from the spring’s external surface. For these reasons, the spring manufacturer asks for a wire with an external oxide, which should act as a thin solid lubricant layer. If this layer is too thin, it can be broken when the wire is passing between the feeding rolls, causing a possible slip of the wire and an increase of friction in the forming section of the press. Slipping in the feeding rolls can be eliminated by increasing the radial pressure of the rolls on the wire, but this action can introduce damage to the wire and eventually can lead to failure in the coiling of the spring. The investigation has been focused on the effect of friction {{as well as on the}} set-up of the coiling machine, and it is based on a preliminary experimental analysis of different wires. Different samples of the same steel with different Fe-oxide layers have been tested in the coiling machine. Most of them allow the correct manufacture of the spring, but some result in the breakage of the spring during coiling. The samples have been characterized in the laboratory relative to mechanical properties, microstructure, thickness of the oxide layer and its morphology and type of oxide and its adherence to the steel underneath. Afterwards, a numerical model of the spring coiling process has been developed introducing the description of the Lemaitre damage model in the material properties. Relative damage has been used as the index to estimate the risk of failure when different friction and process parameters are used...|$|R
