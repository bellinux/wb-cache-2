There are strong historical and scientific ties between ecology, environmental management, and protection. The historical emphasis and poetic naturalistic writings advocating {{the protection of}} wild places by notable ecologists {{in the history of}} conservation biology, such as Aldo Leopold and Arthur Tansley, have been seen as far removed from urban centres where, it is claimed, the concentration of pollution and environmental degradation is located. Palamar (2008) notes an overshadowing by mainstream environmentalism of pioneering women in the early 1900s who fought for urban health ecology (then called <b>euthenics)</b> and brought about changes in environmental legislation. Women such as Ellen Swallow Richards and Julia Lathrop, among others, were precursors to the more popularized environmental movements after the 1950s.|$|E

500|$|Cushing House (formerly called Cushing Hall) is a four-story co-ed {{dormitory}} on Vassar College's {{campus in}} the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. A response to freshmen overcrowding, the college's Board of Trustees hurried the Allen & Collens-designed building, named for college librarian and alumna trustee Florence M. Cushing, to construction and completion in 1927. Cushing was originally designed as eight smaller houses with <b>euthenic</b> principles in mind, but ended up as a single U-shaped dormitory in the Old English manor house style with Jacobean interior furnishings. Students of all grades may live in the house which houses up to 202 in single, double, and triple rooms and are referred to as [...] "Cushlings". Throughout Cushing's history, various proposals and plans have incited controversy among the building's residents, including designating one of its wings as all-black housing and converting one of its common areas into eight single rooms. Contemporary reviewers have looked favorably upon Cushing's aesthetic qualities, declaring it to be one of Vassar's most beautiful buildings.|$|R
500|$|Original {{plans for}} Cushing House, then called Cushing Hall, saw the {{building}} {{as a model of}} Vassar's <b>euthenics</b> program. The term <b>euthenics</b> was first defined by Ellen Swallow Richards of Vassar's class of 1870 as [...] "he betterment of living conditions, though conspicuous endeavor for the purpose of securing more efficient human beings". In accordance with these principles, initial schematics saw the dormitory divided into eight separate houses all surrounded by a brick wall. Cushing was ultimately designed by architectural firm Allen & Collens which was also responsible for several other buildings on Vassar's campus including the Thompson Memorial Library and its wings before Cushing's completion, Wimpfheimer Nursery School concurrently, and Skinner Hall of Music afterwards in 1932. The Cushing project was completed in 1927 and the dormitory was named for the college's first alumnae trustee, Florence M. Cushing, {{who was a member of}} the Vassar class of 1874 and the college's librarian from the year of her graduation until 1876. On account of her death in September 1927, Cushing Hall was not dedicated in time for the incoming class of freshman for the 192728 school year; instead, the dedication which was marked by an informal reception was put off until October 29 of the same year.|$|E

2500|$|In 1925, {{through a}} gift of $550,000.00 from Mrs. Blodgett, the Institute of <b>Euthenics</b> was founded at Vassar. [...] Its aim was [...] "to supply {{scientific}} knowledge of the complex problems of adjustment between individuals and the environment, emphasizing home and family." [...] Vassar historian Colton Johnson noted [...] "The Blodgetts' gift was the largest gift given to the College after Matthew Vassar donated $408,000 in 1861 to get the College started ... Their intention was to bring into the curriculum of the College a course of study specifically designed around the ideas of Ellen Swallow Richards." ...|$|E

The entire university and its logistics moved to Sibiu. Cupcea remained in contact with his colleagues, publishing in Revista de Psihologie: in 1941, Constituția morfologică la bolnavii mintal ("The Morphological Built of the Mentally Ill"); in 1944, Încercarea unui sistem de psihopatologie constituțională evolutiv ("Sketching a System of Progressive Bodily Psychopathology"). He based these studies on the impact of health on intelligence, and the theories of Ernst Kretschmer, by examining the body types of university students, industrial workers and mental patients in relation to their intelligence quotient and state of mind, describing various correlations. A disciple of physician and eugenicist Iuliu Moldovan, he frequented ASTRA Society and published in its paper the 1941 tract Ce este Eugenia ("What Eugenics Is"). It discussed [...] "the improvement of the genetic dowry" [...] through both positive and negative measures. Quoting Moldovan and Francis Galton, Cupcea tried to delimit his field of interest from Nazi racial science (too radical) and <b>euthenics</b> (too mild), preferring Moldovan's term [...] "hygiene of the nation". At the time, he expressed himself as a supporter of strict biological determinism, and demanded the universal introduction of prenuptial examinations to filter out the dysgenics.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Euthenics</b> [...] is {{the study}} of the {{improvement}} of human functioning and well-being by improvement of living conditions.

5000|$|Thus the {{two schools}} of <b>euthenics</b> and {{eugenics}} stand opposed, each viewing the other unkindly. Against eugenics it is urged {{that it is}} a fatalistic doctrine and deprives life of the stimulus toward effort. Against <b>euthenics</b> the other side urges that it demands an endless amount of money to patch up conditions in the vain effort to get greater efficiency. Which of the two doctrines is true?The thoughtful mind must concede that, as is so often the case where doctrines are opposed, each view is partial, incomplete and really false. The truth does not exactly lie between the doctrines; it comprehends them both. What a child becomes is always the resultant of two sets of forces acting from the moment the fertilized egg begins its development—one is the set of internal tendencies and the other is the set of external influences. What the result of an external influence—a particular environmental condition—shall be depends only in part upon the nature of the influence; it depends also upon the internal nature of the reacting protoplasm.Incest, cousin marriage, the marriage of defectives and tuberculous persons, are, in wide circles, taboo. This fact affords the basis for the hope that, when the method of securing strong offspring, even from partially defective stock—and where is the strain without any defect?—is widely known, the teachings of science in respect even to marriage matings will be widely regarded and that in the generations to come the teachings and practice of <b>euthenics</b> will yield greater result because of the previous practice of the principles of eugenics.|$|E

Are we to accept that modem scientific fatalism known as laissez faire, which enjoins the folding of the arms? Are we to preach a gospel of inaction? I for one certainly am not content to do so, and I believe that nothing I have thus far said eugenics is inconsistent with the most vigorous action, {{and that in the}} direction of the betterment of the human race. The end and aim of the eugenists cannot be reproached. The race is far from perfect. Its condition is deplorable. Its improvement is entirely feasible, and in the highest degree desirable. Nor do I refer merely to economic conditions, to the poverty and misery of the disinherited classes. The intellectual state of the world is deplorable, and its improvement is clearly within the reach of society itself. It is therefore a question of method rather than of principle that concerns us.|$|E
