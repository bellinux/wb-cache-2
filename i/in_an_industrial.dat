5|$|In 1957-58 Littleton took a year’s leave. A {{university}} research grant {{allowed him to}} visit Europe to study the influence of Islamic culture on contemporary Spanish pottery. He first stopped in Paris to visit Jean Sala, who had been recommended to him as an artist who worked alone in glass. Though Sala was no longer active in glass, he took Littleton to his now-idle studio. Conditioned by all of his experience at Corning, Littleton knew only of glass-making <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> setting, {{by a team of}} workers.|$|E
5|$|M-81 is an east–west state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. The trunkline travels {{from the city}} of Saginaw at the junction with M-13 to the junction with M-53 east of Cass City over the county line in Greenleaf Township in northwestern Sanilac County in The Thumb area of the state. Outside of the cities and villages along its route, M-81 passes through mostly rural farm country. Near Saginaw it intersects the freeway that carries both Interstate 75 (I-75) and US Highway 23 (US23) <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> area.|$|E
5|$|After the 1938 Anschluss, Rona and Marietta Blau {{left the}} Radium Institute {{because of their}} Jewish {{heritage}} and the antisemitic persecution they experienced in the laboratory. Rona first returned to Budapest and worked <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> laboratory, but within a few months, the position was eliminated. She worked from October to December 1938 in Sweden, and then accepted a temporary position for one year at the University of Oslo, which had been offered by Gleditsch. Reluctant to leave her home, {{at the end of}} her year in Oslo, Rona returned to Hungary. She was appointed to a position at the Radium-Cancer Hospital in Budapest, preparing radium for medicinal purposes.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to Mala's intensity, damage was relatively minimal across Myanmar due to adequate early warnings, while timely and effective evacuations minimized {{loss of life}} along the coast. The greatest damage resulted from a thunderstorm near Yangon on April28 that spawned a possible tornado <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> zone. A total of 586homes were damaged there. Just outside {{the city in the}} Hinthada District, a flash flood killed at least 18people. Overall, the storm claimed 37lives in the country and left US$6.7million in damage. In the wake of Mala, the Red Cross distributed relief aid to affected residents while local officials set up shelters to house those left homeless. Government and social organizations donated 5.4million kyat (US$4,320) in cash to survivors in the Ayeyarwady Region.|$|E
5|$|M-81 {{starts at}} a {{junction}} with M-13, {{with the two}} directions of each highway separated by a median. This central feature ends for M-81 immediately east of the intersection as the highway runs east out of Saginaw. The trunkline follows Washington Road easterly through residential subdivisions to an interchange with I-75/US23 <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> area of Buena Vista Township. This interchange, exit151 along the freeway, is built with roundabouts {{on either side of}} the bridge that carries Washington Road over the freeway in a variant of the diamond interchange design called a dumbbell interchange. After leaving the industrial properties on the east side of I-75/US23, M-81 follows Washington Road through a mixture of farm fields and residential subdivisions. North of the community of Arthur, the highway intersects M-15 (Vassar Road). Further east, M-81 crosses out of Saginaw County; across the border in Tuscola County, the highway follows Saginaw Road.|$|E
5|$|On {{a flight}} {{home from a}} {{business}} trip, the Narrator meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share {{the same kind of}} briefcase. After the flight, the Narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been destroyed by an explosion. With no one else to contact, he calls Tyler, and they meet at a bar. After a conversation about consumerism, outside the bar, Tyler chastises the Narrator for his timidity about needing a place to stay. Tyler requests that the Narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. The Narrator moves into Tyler's home, a large dilapidated house <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> area of their city. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a club ("Fight Club") which routinely meets only to provide an opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.|$|E

5|$|The blow dealt to the community's {{industrial}} {{economy in the}} 1970s was slightly mitigated {{by the presence of}} auto production plants in the metropolitan area. In the late 1980s, the Avanti, an automobile with a fiberglass body originally designed by Studebaker to compete with the Corvette, was manufactured <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> complex on Youngstown's Albert Street. This company moved away after just a few years. A mainstay of Youngstown's {{industrial economy}} has long been the GM Lordstown plant. The General Motors' Lordstown Assembly plant is the largest industrial employer in the area. One of the nation's largest auto plants in terms of square feet, the Lordstown facility was home to production of the Chevrolet Impala, Vega, and Cavalier. It was recently expanded and retooled with a new paint facility.|$|E
5|$|Station 2 was {{constructed}} in the 1920s and considered significant as a rare surviving example of early 20th-century industrial architecture. It was designed <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> Beaux-Arts style, with large arched windows and stringcourse intended {{to prevent it from}} becoming an eyesore given its proximity to affluent communities. It {{was constructed}} with Flemish bond brickwork and decorative limestone elements. It was also constructed to minimize noise and ash pollution. Buildings with such architectural detail were usually found in urban areas, making the Glenwood plant unusual for being far from urban areas {{at the time of its}} construction. The building was divided into three sections: a narrow four-story administration section to the north containing offices; a five-story turbine room containing a large open space with decorated glazed buff brick walls; and a six-story boiler house mainly filled with equipment, topped by six 140-foot smoke stacks (ultimately reaching 265 feet above the floor slab). At the time of its demolition the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation determined that it appeared to meet the criteria for listing on the National Register of Historic Places, triggering an alternative use analysis. Given the building's poor condition after three decades of disuse, the excessive cost of making the building structurally sound prevented any plans to retain or renovate it.|$|E

The video features each Spice Girl in their own individual scene, inspired by their own movie fantasies. Melanie Brown is shown singing {{on top of a}} tank strapped with ammunition <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>industrial</b> post-apocalyptic war scene in a segment based on the film Mad Max Beyond Thunderdome.

Melanie Chisholm is shown in a Chinatown, dressed in a red cheongsam and black pants with her hair in a long ponytail with red streaks; her scene is based upon Year of the Dragon. Geri Halliwell is featured in a black-and-white scene based on Rita Hayworth's performance in Gilda. She is shown performing on a smoky stage in a long, white sequined gown with a group of sailors dancing around her. Victoria Beckham is shown in a missile silo next to a smoking rocket, clad in a black catsuit and with a long ponytail; she is portraying Catwoman from Batman Returns.|$|E
