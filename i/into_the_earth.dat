5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The electric charge from the lightning would flow through the rod directly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to dissolved gases, hot water from geothermal sources may hold in solution trace amounts of toxic {{elements such as}} mercury, arsenic, boron, and antimony.

5|$|The Pennsylvania Turnpike {{groundbreaking}} {{was held}} on October 27, 1938, near Carlisle; Commission Chairman Walter A. Jones thrust the first shovel <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> Turnpike construction was on a tight schedule, since completion of the road was originally planned by May 1, 1940. After the groundbreaking, contracts for finishing the former South Pennsylvania Railroad tunnels, grading the turnpike's right-of-way, constructing bridges and paving were awarded. By July 1939, {{the entire length of}} the turnpike was under contract.|$|E
5|$|Hopes {{that the}} ballet {{would be ready}} in May were dashed and the opening night was {{postponed}} several times. Grisi was absent {{for a few days}} and her return was delayed to protect her health. Lighting, trapdoors, and scene changes needed further rehearsals. Cuts were made in Grisi's role to spare the dancer's health. Instead of returning to her tomb {{at the end of the}} ballet, it was decided that she would be placed on a bed of flowers and sink slowly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> This touch preserved the romantic mood of the Act II finale.|$|E

5|$|In the episode, the Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) land in Wales in 2020, where a drilling operation headed by Nasreen Chaudhry (Meera Syal) is drilling deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> and disrupting a civilisation of Silurians who dwell beneath the earth. The Silurians cause holes {{to open in}} the earth, one of which consumes Amy. The Doctor and Rory capture one Silurian, Alaya (Neve McIntosh), and the Doctor instructs Rory and a local family to not harm Alaya, as it could spark a war. He then takes Nasreen in the TARDIS to the Silurian civilisation to rescue Amy and a local boy.|$|E
5|$|Several {{suggestions}} {{have been}} made {{for the history of}} the Great Stone. There was a succession of plagues in Manchester from the 14th century onwards, and during the Great Plague of 1655–56 the holes {{in the top of the}} stone were filled with vinegar or holy water, through which coins were passed in the belief that would halt the spread of the disease. But the holes are probably too deep for that to have been the stone's original purpose. It may have been a marker on the Roman road between Northwich and Manchester, or some kind of boundary marker. The Great Stone is also thought to have been the base of an Anglo-Saxon cross shaft. A local legend had it that the stone was slowly sinking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> and that its ultimate disappearance would mark the end of the world.|$|E
5|$|Vesuvius {{was formed}} {{as a result of}} the {{collision}} of two tectonic plates, the African and the Eurasian. The former was subducted beneath the latter, deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> As the water-saturated sediments of the oceanic African plate were pushed to hotter depths inside the planet, the water boiled off and caused the melting point of the upper mantle to drop enough to create partial melting of the rocks. Because magma is less dense than the solid rock around it, it was pushed upward. Finding a weak spot at the Earth's surface, it broke through, thus forming the volcano.|$|E

5|$|Disaster {{strikes at}} the press event. The craft {{apparently}} draws power from the broadcasting equipment, and its influence is magnified. The streets of London erupt into violence as those affected go on a rampage. Breen becomes drawn towards the craft and is killed. Quatermass falls under the alien control as well, but is snapped out of it by Roney, who is unaffected. The two men realise that {{a small portion of}} the population are immune. The psychic energy becomes stronger, ripping up streets and buildings, and the spectral image of a Martian towers above the city, centred on Hobbs End. Recalling stories about how the Devil could be defeated with iron and water, Roney theorises the Martian energy could be discharged <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> Roney climbs to the top of a building crane and swings it into the spectre. The crane bursts into flames as it discharges the energy, killing Roney, but the image disappears.|$|E
5|$|The Australian magpie is omnivorous, eating various items {{located at}} or near ground level {{including}} invertebrates such as earthworms, millipedes, snails, spiders and scorpions {{as well as a}} wide variety of insects—cockroaches, ants, beetles, moths and caterpillars and other larvae. Insects, including large adult grasshoppers, may be seized mid-flight. Skinks, frogs, mice and other small animals as well as grain, tubers, figs and walnuts have also been noted as components of their diet. It has even learnt to safely eat the poisonous cane toad by flipping it over and consuming the underparts. Predominantly a ground feeder, the Australian magpie paces open areas methodically searching for insects and their larvae. One study showed birds were able to find scarab beetle larvae by sound or vibration. Birds use their bills to probe <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth</b> or otherwise overturn debris in search of food. Smaller prey are swallowed whole, although magpies rub off the stingers of bees and wasps before swallowing.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} part of {{the wheelhouse}} complex has been dated to 200 BC, although other parts were built later, post-dating the 1st century BC–2nd century AD profusion of these structures in the Western Isles by several centuries. Construction used the stones of the broch itself {{and two of the}} four main structures are amongst the best examples of their type. Three successive periods of construction were undertaken, and the best preserved retains a significant proportion of the stone part of its roof and displays a series of corbelled bays. One structure was built as a circular building and the radial piers were inserted afterwards. This may have been an earlier, less stable design. In one case the piers are alternately rectangular and V-shaped, in another all are to the latter design, again suggesting a developing style. Unlike many wheelhouses elsewhere in Scotland that are built <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth,</b> the Jarlshof structures seem to have been built from ground level upwards.|$|E

5|$|The three {{beings are}} {{discovered}} to be reptilian humanoids, {{and in a}} scuffle, they capture Elliot and strike Tony with a venomous forked tongue; the Doctor and Rory subdue one while the other two retreat with Elliot back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>earth.</b> The Doctor realises the beings are {{a new form of}} Silurians, and that they have relented in their attack since both sides hold a hostage. The captured Silurian calls herself Alaya; {{she is a member of}} the warrior caste, awoken by the drill. Alaya believes, as do all Silurians, that the Earth still belongs to them, that the drilling was a form of attack by the humans, and that they will defeat humanity eventually. Tony, suffering from the effects of the venom, says they should dissect Alaya, but the Doctor warns that it would be seen as an act of war. The Doctor decides to travel in the TARDIS down the drilling shaft to talk to the rest of the Silurians and work out a truce; Nasreen accompanies him.|$|E
5|$|After {{visiting the}} near-ruined town of Melmond, the Light Warriors {{go to the}} Earth Cave to defeat a vampire and {{retrieve}} the Star Ruby, which gains passage to Sage Sadda's cave. With Sadda's Rod, the Warriors venture deeper <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth</b> Cave and destroy the Earth Fiend, Lich. The Light Warriors then obtain a canoe and enter Gurgu Volcano and defeat the Fire Fiend, Kary. The Levistone from the nearby Ice Cave allows them to raise an airship to reach the northern continents. After they prove their courage by retrieving the Rat's Tail from the Castle of Ordeal, the King of the Dragons, Bahamut, promotes each Light Warrior. A kind gesture is repaid by a fairy, receiving special liquid that produces oxygen, and the Warriors use it to help defeat the Water Fiend, Kraken, in the Sunken Shrine. They also recover a Slab, which allows a linguist named Dr. Unne to teach them the Lefeinish language. The Lefeinish give the Light Warriors access to the Floating Castle that Tiamat, the Wind Fiend, has taken over. With the Four Fiends defeated and the Orbs restored, a portal opens in the Temple of Fiends which takes them 2000 years into the past. There the Warriors discover that the Four Fiends sent Garland (now the archdemon Chaos) {{back in time and}} he sent the Fiends to the future to do so, creating a time loop by which he could live forever. The Light Warriors defeat Chaos, thus ending the paradox, and return home. By ending the paradox, however, the Light Warriors have changed the future to one where their heroic deeds remain unknown outside of legend.|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} types of lunar eclipses: penumbral, when the Moon crosses only <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> penumbra; partial, when the Moon crosses {{partially}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> umbra; and total, when the Moon crosses entirely <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> umbra. Total lunar eclipses pass through all three phases. Even during a total lunar eclipse, however, the Moon is not completely dark. Sunlight refracted through <b>the</b> <b>Earth's</b> atmosphere enters <b>the</b> umbra and provides a faint illumination. Much as in a sunset, the atmosphere tends to more strongly scatter light with shorter wavelengths, so the illumination of the Moon by refracted light has a red hue, thus the phrase 'Blood Moon' is often found in descriptions of such lunar events {{as far back as}} eclipses are recorded.|$|R
