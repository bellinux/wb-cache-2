50|$|A {{commonly}} used synthetic material is PLA - polylactic acid. This is a polyester which degrades within {{the human body}} to form lactic acid, a naturally occurring chemical which is easily removed from the body. Similar materials are polyglycolic acid (PGA) and polycaprolactone (PCL): their degradation mechanism {{is similar to that}} of PLA, but they exhibit respectively a faster and a slower rate of degradation compared to PLA. While these materials have well maintained mechanical strength and structural integrity, they exhibit a hydrophobic nature. This hydrophobicity inhibits their biocompatibility, which makes them less effective for in vivo use as tissue scaffolding. In order to fix the lack of biocompatibility, much research has been done to combine these hydrophobic materials with hydrophilic and more biocompatible hydrogels. While these hydrogels have a superior biocompatibility, they lack the structural integrity of PLA, PCL, and PGA. By combining the two different types of materials, researchers are trying to create a synergistic relationship that produces a more biocompatible tissue scaffolding.Scaffolds may also be constructed from natural materials: in particular different derivatives of the extracellular matrix have been studied to evaluate their ability to support cell growth.

The <b>decellularised</b> tissues were compared to cellular cryopreserved valve tissues using histology, immunohistochemistry, quantitation of total DNA, collagen and glycosaminoglycan content, in vitro cytotoxicity assays, uniaxial tensile testing and subcutaneous implantation in mice. The <b>decellularised</b> tissues showed no histological evidence of cells or cell remnants and over 97 % DNA removal in all regions (arterial wall, muscle, leaflet and junction).

40|$|Objectives: Vein grafts are {{commonly}} used for coronary artery bypass surgery but poor long-term patency and high failure rate make the idea of ???designer??? bypass vessels attractive. Here we have investigated the possibility of forming bypass vessels from populations of vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) selected for their anti-thrombotic potential. Methods: Clonal populations of rat VSMCs were derived and characterised for their morphology, protein expression and mediator production. Selected cells were also seeded into vascular scaffolds derived by <b>decellularising</b> rat aortae and cultured for periods of up to 40 days. Results: Clone 5 {{was found to be}} the optimal clone due to its ability to produce the anti-platelet hormone prostaglandin (PG) I 2 and inhibit platelet activation. In experiments combining the synthetic vessels with platelets, a notable inhibition of platelet activation was seen with a reduction in platelet aggregation (72 ?? 4 % to 31 ?? 9 %) (Abstract 024 Figure 1), adhesion (43 ?? 2 % to 19 ?? 6 %) (Abstract 024 Figure 2), decreased production of thromboxane A 2 (58 ?? 8 ng/ml to 31 ?? 3 ng/ml) and increased prostaglandin I 2 production (0. 6 ?? 0. 5 ng/ml to 5. 5 ?? 0. 8 ng/ml), in response to collagen (3 ??g/ml). Conclusions: These results demonstrate that clonal VSMC populations with favourable characteristics, such as the production of anti-thrombotic PGI 2 can be isolated and used to produce anti-thrombotic vessels. This raises the possibility of producing vessels for bypass surgery by the simple seeding of selected VSMC populations into inert vascular scaffolds.

Their structural and biological roles in animal tissues have inspired the development of regenerative therapies that incorporate collagen as a base material, thus providing a naturally recognisable surface for cell attachment and proliferation. In this review, recent collagen-related patents / patent applications are divided into three main areas: methods of collagen extraction / purification / synthesis (Area 1), methods of collagen molecular modification / processing (Area 2) and collagen scaffolds / implants (Area 3). Within Area 1, there are disclosures for methods of obtaining collagenous materials, including a method that uses urea to isolate collagen from collagen-containing natural fibres. Methods have also emerged to avoid the risk of cross-species infection including the extraction of collagen from marine sources and the synthesis of modular collagen-like peptides in bacterium models. Within Area 2, there are recently disclosed methods that can increase the resistance of collagen to degradation, including covalent / non-covalent crosslinking and a method of stabilising the collagen triple he-lix through O-methylation. Methods have also been recently disclosed to remove antigenic surface carbohydrate moieties and for processing collagen to induce fibril fusion. Within Area 3, there have been developments in the functional use of collagen in regenerative therapies, including a method to <b>decellularise</b> thick collagen-rich tissue extracts Z scaffold, a method to provide a support mesh for collagen scaffolds such that they hold their external shape on implantation and a method which allows the creation of composite scaffolds and multi-layer scaffolds for trans-tissue implants. In addition, two recent patents disclose the use of collagen injections {{for the treatment of}} synovial joints and intervertebral discs.

A process for the decellularisation of porcine pulmonary roots was developed incorporating trypsin (2. 25 × 104 Unit. ml- 1) digestion of the adventitial surface of the scraped pulmonary artery and sequential treatment with: hypotonic Tris buffer (HTB; 10 mM Tris pH 8. 0, 0. 1 % (w/v) EDTA, 10 KIU aprotinin), 0. 1 % (w/v) SDS in HTB, two cycles of DNase and RNase, and sterilisation with 0. 1 % (v/v) peracetic acid. Histology confirmed an absence of cells and retention of the gross histoarchitecture. DNA levels were reduced by > 90 % throughout the <b>decellularised</b> tissue and functional genes were not detected using PCR. Immunohistochemistry showed a lack of α-gal epitopes and confirmed cell removal but a loss of collagen IV. In vitro biocompatibility studies indicated the <b>decellularised</b> leaflets were not cytotoxic while the pulmonary wall was shown to reduce 3 T 3 cells viability in 3 out of 6 samples.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the effect of low concentration sodium dodecyl sulphate decellularisation on the in vitro biomechanical and hydrodynamic properties of cryopreserved human aortic and pulmonary roots. Method: The biomechanical and hydrodynamic properties of cryopreserved <b>decellularised</b> human aortic and pulmonary roots were fully characterised and compared to cellular human aortic and pulmonary roots in an unpaired study. Following review of these results, a further study was performed to investigate the influence of a specific processing step during the decellularisation protocol (‘scraping’) in a paired comparison, and to improve the method of the closed valve competency test by incorporating a more physiological boundary condition. Results: The majority of the biomechanical and hydrodynamic characteristics of the <b>decellularised</b> aortic and pulmonary roots were similar compared to their cellular counterparts. However, several differences were noted, particularly in the functional biomechanical parameters of the pulmonary roots.

40|$|To {{analyze the}} effects of decellularisation on the biomechanical proprieties of porcine common carotid arteries, decellularisation was {{performed}} by a detergent-enzymatic procedure, which preserves extracellular matrix scaffold. Internal diameter, external diameter and wall thickness were measured by optic microscopy on neighbouring histological sections before and after decellularisation. Rupture tests were conducted.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine the existence of porcine endogenous retrovirus (PERV) in fresh and <b>decellularised</b> porcine tissues. Methods: Porcine tissues (both fresh and <b>decellularised)</b> were analysed using validated assays specific for PERV: polymerase chain reaction (PCR), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR).

Previous {{studies have shown that}} <b>decellularised</b> porcine arteries have potential for future development and clinical translation.

In this study it was hypothesised that a bioactive peptide could be self-assembled within the <b>decellularised</b> tissue to overcome the problems of thrombogenesis and to aid and enhance re-endothelialisation. A method for self-assembling the tape forming peptide, P 11 - 4 within <b>decellularised</b> tissues was developed. The study then went on to explore the P 11 series of peptides as materials for tissue engineering by examining biocompatibility and haemocompatibility and demonstrated the use of self-assembled peptide coatings to prevent thrombus formation and enhance re-endothelialisation. The self-assembly of peptide P 11 - 4 within <b>decellularised</b> porcine internal carotid artery was assessed using a range of microscopic and spectroscopic techniques. Fluorescent microscopy was used to show the penetration of the peptide throughout the <b>decellularised</b> conduit. Self-assembly of the peptide was assessed by FTIR spectroscopy. Using CLSM and MPLSM it was shown that the peptide self-assembled around the extracellular matrix of the acellular tissue. Fluorescent microscopy was used in conjunction with a specially designed flow cell to show that the peptide coating remained in the <b>decellularised</b> vessel for over 14 days under model flow conditions. The biocompatibility and haemocompatibility of a library of 43 peptides was assessed to identify ideal candidate peptides for use and to develop design characteristics for the application of self-assembling peptides in biomedical settings. Testing was carried out using cytotoxicity testing, the Chandler loop thrombosis model, a haemolysis assay and a complement inhibition assay. The results showed that large poly-cationic peptides were non-bio or haemo compatible, large neutral peptides enhanced thrombosis formation and that poly-anionic peptides with hydrophobic cores inhibited the complement system. Peptide coatings of P 11 - 4, P 11 - 8 and P 11 - 12 were shown to decrease, and in the case of P 11 - 12 prevent, thrombus formation; showing potential for application in small diameter acellular blood vessels. Peptide P 11 - 4, functionalised with cyclic RGD, was shown to enhance the attachment and retention of ovine endothelial cells on the <b>decellularised</b> vessel, demonstrating the potential of functionalised peptide to enhance re-endothelialisation.

Rabbit oesophagi were <b>decellularised</b> using the detergent-enzymatic treatment (DET), a combination of deionised water, sodium deoxycholate and DNase-I. Samples were stored in phosphate-buffered saline solution at 4 °C (4 °C) or slow cooled in medium with 10 % Me 2 SO at - 1 °C/min followed by storage in liquid nitrogen (SCM). Structural and functional analyses were performed prior to and after 2 and 4 weeks and 3 and 6 months of storage under each condition. Efficient decellularisation was achieved after 2 cycles of DET as determined with histology and DNA quantification, with preservation of the ECM. Only the SCM method, commonly used for cell storage, maintained the architecture and biomechanical properties of the scaffold up to 6 months. On the contrary, 4 °C method was effective for short-term storage but led to a progressive distortion and degradation of the tissue architecture at the following time points. Efficient storage allows a timely use of <b>decellularised</b> oesophagi, essential for clinical translation. Here we describe that slow cooling with cryoprotectant solution in liquid nitrogen vapour leads to reliable long-term storage of <b>decellularised</b> oesophageal scaffolds for {{tissue engineering}} purposes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of <b>decellularised</b> scaffolds for small diameter vascular grafts is hampered by their limited patency, {{due to the}} lack of luminal cell coverage by endothelial cells (EC) and to the low tone of the vessel due to absence of a contractile smooth muscle cells (SMC). In this study, we identify a population of vascular progenitor c-Kit+/Sca- 1 - cells available in large numbers and derived from immuno-privileged embryonic stem cells (ESCs). We also define an efficient and controlled differentiation protocol yielding fully to differentiated ECs and SMCs in sufficient numbers to allow the repopulation of a tissue engineered vascular graft. When seeded ex vivo on a <b>decellularised</b> vessel, c-Kit+/Sca- 1 -derived cells recapitulated the native vessel structure and upon in vivo implantation in the mouse, markedly reduced neointima formation and mortality, restoring functional vascularisation. We showed that Krüppel-like transcription factor 4 (Klf 4) regulates the choice of differentiation pathway of these cells through β-catenin activation and was itself regulated by the canonical Wnt pathway activator lithium chloride. Our data show that ESC-derived c-Kit+/Sca- 1 -cells can be differentiated through a Klf 4 /β-catenin dependent pathway and are a suitable source of vascular progenitors for the creation of superior tissue-engineered vessels from <b>decellularised</b> scaffolds...|$|E

40|$|Perfusion decellularisation is a {{promising}} technique in scaffold production for tissue engineering. The similarity of <b>decellularised</b> extracellular matrix to native matrix is attractive {{for the development}} of compatible and functional constructs for therapeutic applications. Here, whole organs were processed for tissue culture with an emphasis on production staging. Adult rat hearts were perfusion-decellularised on a modified chromatography system that facilitated the study of flow properties and effluent material to better understand the transport processes of decellularisation. Tracer pulse experiments confirmed gross integrity of the ECM, and suggested the accumulation of debris in tissue lumen at late decellularisation. The rate of protein loss matched visual indications of decellularisation, slowing to zero as the tissue achieved a uniform appearance. <b>Decellularised</b> hearts were cryopreserved for up to 1 year before reconditioning including disinfection and soluble protein perfusion to remove adsorbed detergents...|$|E
40|$|Scientific Session - Disc regeneration: no. A 140 Introduction: The {{intervertebral}} disc (IVD) {{is a highly}} specialised niche that is rich in proteoglycans and water. The loss of these factors are signs of IVD degeneration, in which the resulting biochemical imbalance and inability to maintain {{the integrity of the}} tissues can lead to structural and biomechanical changes to the disc, ultimately affecting their function. We hypothesise that the localised disc environment (the IVD niche) itself can contribute to the development and upkeep of the IVD by aiding in the differentiation and/or activities of progenitors/stem cells into IVD cells. The aim {{of this study was to}} introduce pluripotent stem cells into a <b>decellularised</b> IVD scaffold, and study how the IVD environment can alter the behaviour and phenotype of the stem cells. Materials and Methods: Human Embryonic Stem cell line 2 (HES 2) cells were labelled with a fluorescent dye and then either injected into whole <b>decellularised</b> bovine IVD via the annulus or seeded onto the surface of <b>decellularised</b> nucleus pulposus (NP) tissue, and cultured in DMEM for 7 or 14 days. The samples were then cryosectioned to examine their morphology, viability and cell surface expression of particular NP and stem cell markers by immunostaining. Results: The HES 2 cells that were introduced into the IVD niche were observed to be viable after 7 and 14 days of culture. The cells that were injected into the bovine IVD did not migrate or distribute evenly throughout the tissue and were observed to cluster around the needle track that was created during cell injection. The ESCs that were seeded onto the <b>decellularised</b> NP tissues exhibited mixed morphology with the presence of spherical-shaped and star-shaped cells. Additionally, the cells that were seeded onto the <b>decellularised</b> tissues had limited penetration into the tissues. There was a loss of pluripotency factors Oct 3 / 4 and Nanog observed by day 7 and expression of NP marker cadherin 2 after 14 days. Conclusion: HES 2 cells were able to survive on the <b>decellularised</b> IVD scaffold however there was limited penetration of the cells into the tissues, which was possibly due to a limited migratory ability of the cells. It also appeared that the injection of cells into the 3 D whole IVD scaffold versus the seeding on top of the surface of IVD tissues gave rise to cells of differing morphologies, with the cells in the 3 D scaffold exhibiting a more uniform morphology. This indicated that despite the use of the same type of scaffold, the way in which the cells are cultured (a 3 D environment versus a 2 D environment) can potentially alter cellular morphology. The stem cells were positive for NP marker cadherin 2 at 14 days, an indication that the scaffold could aid and/or maintain its expression, but as to whether or not these stem cells had truly become NP-like requires further characterisation of the gene and protein expression of these cells...|$|E
40|$|Cardiac valve {{replacement}} {{is the second}} most common heart operation in the Western World. Valve replacements currently available are poorly adapted for use in young patients who typically require multiple re-operations as they grow, resulting in increased morbidity and mortality. Tissue-engineering a living heart {{valve replacement}} would be an ideal substitute as it would not require drug therapies or re-operation. Bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells {{have been shown to be}} capable of differentiating into a variety of lineages and may be advantageous as a cell source for tissue engineering applications. Attempts were made to isolate human and porcine mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) from the respective bone marrows using gradient-centrifugation to separate the cells and complete Dulbecco"s Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM) to culture the cells. The cellular material from one bone marrow was transferred to one 25 CM 2 tissue Culture flask. Cell differentiation was attempted by supplementing complete culture medium with growth factors and biochemicals. The phenotype of the human MSC (hMSC) was then examined by FACS analysis. A previously developed <b>decellularised</b> porcine aortic valve matrix was biochemically characterised to ensure that the major matrix components had not been removed by the decellularisation procedure. Furthermore the biocompatibility of the <b>decellularised</b> tissue compared to fresh tissue was assessed by subcutaneous implantation into mice (n [...] 4). hMSC were then seeded onto the <b>decellularised</b> porcine aortic valve matrices in vitro and the ability of the cells to migrate into the tissue compared to smooth muscle cells in a static culture system was assessed. Putative porcine MSC (pMSC) and hMSC were successfully isolated from their respective bone marrows. Putative pMSC were found to have a cell doubling time (CDT) of 106 hours and hMSC had a CDT of 151 hours. A failure to successfully culture pMSC was found to be due to a change in the supplier of DMEM used. Attempts to differentiate porcine MSC (pMSC) produced adipogenic cells but failed to produce osteogenic, chondrogenic, neurogenic, myogenic or smooth muscle lineage cells. hMSC were successfully differentiated into cells of the adipogenic, myogenic and neurogenic lineage. However, attempts to clone the cells were unsuccessful. FACS analysis of hMSC indicated that the cells were CD 45 -,, CD 13 +, D 7 FIB +/-, CD 105 +, CD 10 +/-, LNGFR +/-, CD 55 +, BNP- and AP+/-. Analysis of hydroxyproline, sulphated proteoglycan and DNA content of the <b>decellularised</b> porcine valve tissue indicated no change in collagen or GAG content and removal of cellular DNA. Implanted <b>decellularised</b> tissues were accepted by the mice in comparison to fresh tissue and appeared to be undergoing regeneration. Furthermore, the cell infiltrate into the matrices was favourable, being low in T-cells but more macrophages and endothelial cells. Seeding the decellulansed matrix with hMSC showed that the cells migrated into the tissue to up to 2 % of the cell density found in native valve tissue compared to 0 % of the smooth muscle cells. Failure to clone hMSC meant that differentiation could have been a result of multiple cell precursors being present in the bone marrow rather than a stem cell population. Biochemical and biocompatibility analyses of the <b>decellularised</b> porcine valve matrix showed that the tissue was unaltered by the procedure and biocompatible. hMSC were also observed to migrate into the tissue under static seeding conditions. In conclusion,, mesenchymal stem cells represent a promising cell source for tissue engineering a living aortic heart valve. However, more research is required to further characterise the cells and optimise their growth and differentiation. The <b>decellularised</b> porcine valve matrix developed by shows potential as a matrix for tissue engineering an aortic heart valve. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Many {{biomaterials}} {{are used}} in cardio-thoracic surgery with good short-term results. However, calcification, dehiscence, and formation of scar tissue are reported. The aim {{of this research is}} to characterise <b>decellularised</b> pericardium after supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO 2) processing as an alternative biological material for uses in cardio-thoracic surgery. Methods: Porcine and bovine pericardium were <b>decellularised</b> using scCO 2. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, elastic modulus, fracture toughness and suture retention strength were determined. Ultrastructure was visualised using Scanning Electron Microscopy. Water uptake and swelling was experimentally determined. Commercially available glutaraldehyde treated bovine pericardium was used as gold standard for comparison. Results: scCO 2 <b>decellularised</b> porcine (and bovine pericardium) maintained their tensile strength compared to untreated native pericardium (13. 3 ± 2. 4 MPa vs 14. 0 ± 4. 1 MPa, p = 0. 73). Tensile strength of glutaraldehyde treated pericardium was significantly higher compared to untreated pericardium (19. 4 ± 7. 3 MPa vs 10. 2 ± 2. 2 MPa, p= 0. 02). Suture retention strength of scCO 2 treated pericardium was significantly higher than glutaraldehyde treated pericardium (p = 0. 01). We found no anisotropy of scCO 2 or glutaraldehyde treated pericardium based on a trouser tear test. Ultrastructure was uncompromised in scCO 2 treated pericardium, while glutaraldehyde treated pericardium showed deterioration of extracellular matrix. Conclusion: scCO 2 processing preserves initial mechanical and structural properties of porcine and bovine pericardium, while glutaraldehyde processing damages the extracellular matrix of bovine pericardium. Decellularisation of tissue using scCO 2 might give long-term solutions for cardio-thoracic surgery without compromising initial good mechanical properties...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{evaluate}} the use of a <b>decellularised</b> scaffold and its re-endothelialisation in vitro in order to create human vascular substitutes containing venous valves. This research is clinically relevant particularly with regard to the development of venous (valve containing) transplants to replace a diseased femoral vein valve and/or obstructed veins. This technique may enable causal treatment of venous reflux and obstructions. Materials and methodsValve-bearing segments of human allogeneic great saphenous veins (GSVs) were <b>decellularised</b> using sodium deoxycholic acid (SD) and treated with DNase I. Human venous endothelial cells (ECs) were enzymatically harvested from the GSV, expanded up to the 3 rd passage using FCS (n= 20) or human AB serum (hABS; n= 8) supplemented media before used for re-seeding. In special bioreactors, 3 D re-seeding of 28 <b>decellularised</b> GSV was performed with constant perfusion (A; n= 8), bidirectional perfusion (B; n= 8), bidirectional perfusion/reduced flow (C; n= 2), static conditions (D; n= 2), and bidirectional perfusion/reduced flow using hABS (E; n= 8) instead of FCS. <b>Decellularised</b> GSV, scaled-up EC and 3 D-seeded tissue-engineered valve containing neo-veins underwent immunohistochemical and PCR characterisation. ResultsIntact collagen and elastin networks as well as complete acellularity were shown after GSV decellularisation. In EC culture, supplementation with hABS led to a significantly higher expression of vWF compared to FCS (p= 0. 025). Additional EC markers such as CD 31, FLK- 1 and VE-Cadherin were not altered. EC re-seeding using hABS supplemented medium (E) led to a confluent monolayer of cells that were immunohistochemically positive for FLK- 1, CD 31, vWF and VE-Cadherin and by means of PCR after RNA preparation in 7 of 8 cases but was unsuccessful if FCS was used (A–D). In A–D cells presented as conglomerates positive for CD 31 and VE-Cadherin, suggesting sufficient intercellular contact but not cell–matrix contact. ConclusionsTreatment with SD and DNase enables complete decellularisation of human valve containing veins whereas 3 D matrix components such as collagen and elastin remain preserved. The lumen of the scaffold including the valves can be successfully re-seeded with a human EC monolayer in a 3 D bioreactor. There is substantial evidence that hABS and not FCS is essential for the completion of cell–matrix contacts in human veins...|$|E
40|$|The use of <b>decellularised</b> tissues {{represents}} a valid and emerging alternative over traditional synthetic scaffolds, which have limited ability {{to mimic the}} sophisticated tissue specificity 1. Within the tissue engineering context, gels composed by <b>decellularised</b> tissues have been produced through enzymatic digestion followed by basic pH treatment 2. Nevertheless, low viscosity, stability and reproducibility often limit their applicative potential. Herein, ECM, obtained from porcine blood vessels, was imbedded within alginate gels and compared to both alginate and alginate/gelatin gels aiming to process <b>decellularised</b> tissues in diverse physical forms and therefore broaden their application. Porcine blood vessels were <b>decellularised</b> 1 and gels were further obtained adapting the procedure previously described 2. Gels containing ECM or gelatin (8 mg/ml) and different concentrations of alginate (2 - 20 mg/ml) were produced by internal gelation (CaCO 3 2, 8 % w/v, D- (+) -gluconic acid δ-lactone 0, 5 % w/v). The alginate samples were obtained preserving the final polymer concentration (10, 13, 18, 28 mg/ml). Rheological characterization was performed by time, frequency and temperature sweep analyses 3. Stability tests were conducted using cell culture medium (complete DMEM medium) from 3 hours up to 7 days. Additionally, preliminary biological characterization was assessed through DNA content after seeding EA. hy 926 for 1 day. ECM-loaded alginate gels (AlgECM) samples were successfully obtained for all the concentration tested. All the samples could be removed from a mould while retaining the shape. The storage and loss moduli of all the tested alginate concentrations were frequency-independent, with the storage modulus higher than the loss modulus, therefore exhibiting gel behaviour. Higher final polymer concentration resulted in gels with higher complex viscosity. Overall, AlgECM samples showed higher values of both storage and loss moduli and higher stability in the medium comparing with unloaded alginate gels. Samples obtained with gelatin could not be produced at polymer concentrations lower than 18 mg/ml. The AlgECM samples remained stable in cell culture medium; samples with the lowest concentration of alginate (2 mg/ml of alginate and 8 mg/ml w/v of ECM) degraded after 7 days. A first biological characterization indicated an increased number of cells for AlgECM gels compared to alginate and alginate/gelatin samples. A novel gel composed of alginate and native vascular <b>decellularised</b> ECM is here proposed. AlgECM gels able to combine the properties of its components. Alginate improved ECM gels reproducibility and allowed the tailoring of gels rheological properties through the variation of alginate concentration. The use of ECM should promote {{the creation of a}} tissue-specific material, able to enhance cell growth and proliferation. However, a wider biological characterization should be conducted to test the ECM influence. References 1. Cells Tissues Organs 200 : 363 – 373, 2015. 2. Biomaterials 29 : 1630 - 1637, 2008. 3.
