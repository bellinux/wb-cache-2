40|$|The cold-adapted genus Cochlearia L. (scurvy grass), a young {{polyploid}} complex {{within the}} Brassicaceae family (Cruciferae), displays {{a range of}} highly interesting cytogenetic and ecotypic characteristics and might serve as an excellent model system to study general evolutionary mechanisms such as polyploidization, hybridization, or cold and edaphic adaptation. The presented study provides, for the first time, comprehensive cytogenetic and highly-resolving phylogenomic analyses, and first metabolomic insights into the Cochlearia cold response. Thus, the findings presented herein might constitute {{a good starting point}} for further in-depth analyses of said evolutionary aspects e. g. based on population-genomic datasets. In chapter 1, the cytogenetic evolution within the genus Cochlearia is analyzed via both conventional chromosome counts and flow cytometry measurements. Based on a comprehensive literature review on published chromosome counts, the geographical distribution of cytogenetic variability is described, suggesting an <b>early</b> <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the two diploid karyotypes (2 n= 12 and 2 n= 14). The high frequency of aberrant chromosome numbers in polyploid taxa is interpreted as a result of frequent interploidal hybridization, given the near absence of interspecific fertility barriers, and thus reflecting the dynamics of polyploid evolution within the genus Cochlearia. Moreover, a correlation between genome size and chromosome number, as well as genome downsizing in polyploid taxa are revealed. Chapter 2 provides comprehensive phylogenomic analyses based on Illumina high-throughput sequencing data. Chloroplast and mitochondrial phylogenies are largely in congruence and indicate a glacial survival of the whole genus in arctic refuge areas as well as repeated adaptation to alpine habitats in Central Europe. Divergence time estimates, based on complete chloroplast genomes, imply a diversification of the whole genus {{over the course of several}} Pleistocene glaciations within the last 700, 000 years. Results from nuclear data analyses support both the clear evolutionary separation of the two diploid karyotypes as described in chapter 1, as well as the basal phylogenetic position of arctic taxa as shown in organellar phylogenies, and they reveal new insights into the evolutionary origins of the different polyploid taxa. In chapter 3, the metabolomic analysis of the Cochlearia cold response via metabolite profiling using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) is described. Based on temperature-related bioclimatic variables (WorldClim), four bioclimatic ecotypes are defined and utilized as group priors for statistical analyses. All studied plants/ecotypes show strong metabolomic adjustments in reaction to 20 days of cold treatment under 5 °C, especially with regard to increased levels of soluble carbohydrates and amino acids. Statistical analyses do not show a strong discrimination of the four bioclimatic ecotypes based on the analyzed metabolites, yet slight intrageneric variation among the bioclimatic clusters is described, implying similarities in the cold response between arctic and alpine taxa...|$|E
40|$|The Opisthobranchia {{comprise}} {{highly specialized}} marine gastropods and have therefore {{been subject to}} diverse investigations covering various biological disciplines. However, a robust phylogeny of these gastropods is still lacking and several subclades have only been rarely studied. Furthermore, crucial aspects {{for the evolution of}} Opisthobranchia have not been comparatively analysed. Therefore, the aim of the present thesis is to gain new insights into the phylogeny of the Opisthobranchia with special focus on certain critical groups (Pleurobranchomorpha, Acteonoidea) and to assess several crucial features of the evolution of the investigated clades. The combination of four different gene markers (18 S rDNA, 28 S rDNA, 16 S rDNA and CO 1) and modern molecular systematic analysis tools were used to construct phylogenetic hypotheses focussing on Opisthobranchia as a whole as well as Pleurobranchomorpha and Acteonoidea in more detail. Intriguing new aspects of phylogeny and evolution of Opisthobranchia were revealed. First of all, monophyly of Opisthobranchia is definitely rejected based on the present data, while monophyly of Euthyneura (comprising Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata) is supported. Monophyly of opisthobranch subclades is confirmed for Nudipleura (as well as its constituting groups Nudibranchia and Pleurobranchomorpha), Umbraculida, Pteropoda (as well as subclades Thecosomata and Gymnosomata) and Acochlidiacea, for Cephalaspidea (if Runcinacea is regarded as a separate clade) and for Sacoglossa (if Cylindrobulla is accepted as an Oxynoacea). Aplysiomorpha are rendered paraphyletic due to the position of Akera bullata, but this result needs further investigation and should be considered with caution. The Nudipleura are found as the first single offshoot of the Euthyneura implying an <b>early</b> <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the last common ancestor of this clade. The remaining taxa form two main clades, one comprising the opisthobranch subgroups Umbraculida, Cephalaspidea, Aplysiomorpha and Pteropoda, while the other contains the pulmonate taxa and the opisthobranch Sacoglossa and Acochlidiacea. The interrelationships within these clades remain largely unresolved due to low statistical support values. However, a possible sister group relationship of Acochlidiacea and Eupulmonata receives statistical support. Opisthobranchia display various highly specific adaptations to diverse food sources. However, evolution of these specialized traits has never been assessed at an analytical level. The current thesis reconstructs the evolution of dietary preferences with novel methodologies based on the newly proposed phylogenetic hypothesis. Reconstruction of dietary evolution revealed herbivory as the ancestral condition in Euthyneura implying that carnivory evolved at least five times independently in the diverse lineages. The first comprehensive molecular phylogenetic hypothesis of the Pleurobranchomorpha could not reveal monophyly of the two main subclades Pleurobranchaeidae and Pleurobranchidae. This is due to the position of a single taxon (Euselenops luniceps) which is assigned to the Pleurobranchaeidae based on morphology but clusters within Pleurobranchidae in the current hypothesis. Furthermore, the tribe Berthellini and the genus Berthella are rendered paraphyletic by the current analyses. The results of molecular systematic analyses were used to reconstruct historical biogeography of Pleurobranchomorpha. Four different methodological approaches were applied yielding ambiguous results for Pleurobranchomorpha. However, the Pleurobranchidae comprising about 80 % of the extant Pleurobranchomorpha most probably derived from an Antarctic origin. Dating of the phylogenetic tree via molecular clock methods yielded divergence of Pleurobranchidae into the Antarctic Tomthompsonia antarctica and the remaining species in Early Oligocene. Afterwards the latter underwent rapid radiation during Oligocene and Early Miocene. This divergence event coincides with two major geological events in the Antarctic region. On the one hand, the onset of glaciation {{and on the other hand}} the opening of the Drake Passage with concurrent formation of an Antarctic circumpolar current (ACC). I suppose that these sudden and dramatic changes in climate and palaeogeography probably accounted for migration of the last common ancestor of Pleurobranchidae (besides Tomthompsonia) into warmer regions via the Drake Passage to the Western Atlantic and Eastern Pacific and via the South Tasman Rise to the Indo-West Pacific. Furthermore, the ACC may have triggered larval dispersal to the Eastern Atlantic. The phylogenetic position of Acteonoidea has been a matter of debate for decades and they have long been considered as basal opisthobranchs. Results of the present thesis rather support placement in “Lower Heterobranchia” as sister group of Rissoelloidea. The current division of Acteonoidea into three families has never been investigated by means of phylogenetic methods. Thus, this thesis provides the first comprehensive investigation of this clade challenging present division into three families. The results rather support division into two main clades with the monogeneric Bullinidae clustering within Aplustridae doubting its separate status. Additionally, Rictaxis punctocaelatus which has been assigned to Acteonidae clusters basal to Aplustridae rendering Acteonidae paraphyletic. Since information on morphology of R. punctocaelatus was lacking until now, I conducted the first detailed investigation on morphology and histology of this species in order to reassess the unexpected molecular systematic placement. Character tracing analyses revealed similarities with both acteonoidean families implying an intermediate position of this species which might be assigned to a separate family in the future. Furthermore, the common features of Acteonidae and Rictaxis (massive shell, small foot, anterior mantle cavity opening, and absence of oral gland) are possibly plesiomorphic for the whole Acteonoidea. In summary, the results of the present thesis provide valuable novel insights into the phylogeny and evolution of the Opisthobranchia by employing state-of-the-art approaches of molecular systematics and evolutionary reconstruction. Thus, diverse hypotheses on opisthobranch phylogeny and evolution were either supported or rejected as well as novel hypotheses proposed which offer the basis for further research on these extraordinary gastropods. Die Opisthobranchia repräsentieren eine Gruppierung hoch spezialisierter und morphologisch heterogener Gastropoden, deren Systematik und Klassifikation kontrovers diskutiert wird. Die Radiation der strukturell vielfältigen Untergruppen hat zu einem Phänomen geführt, dass als „weitverbreiteter Parallelismus“ (rampant parallelism) bezeichnet wird. Durch diese konvergenten Entwicklungen auf morphologischer Ebene sind Synapomorphien für die Opisthobranchia umstritten und phylogenetische Untersuchungen werden erschwert. Darüber hinaus sind einige Untergruppierungen der Opisthobranchia bisher nur unzureichend untersucht. Ziel der vorliegenden Arbeit ist es deshalb, neue Einblicke in die Phylogenie und Evolution der Opisthobranchia zu gewinnen. Dabei wird zudem spezielles Augenmerk auf bestimmte kritische Gruppierungen (Pleurobranchomorpha, Acteonoidea) gelegt, die bisher wenig untersucht wurden. Die Aufstellung neuer Phylogenie-Hypothesen für die untersuchten Gruppen bildet die Basis dieser Arbeit. Darüber hinaus wird die Entwicklung ausgewählter Merkmale mit Hilfe der Phylogenie-Hypothesen rekonstruiert, um damit Rückschlüsse auf die Evolution der untersuchten Gruppierungen zu ziehen. Zur Erstellung der Phylogenie-Hypothesen wurde eine Kombination von vier verschiedenen genetischen Markern, darunter zwei nukleäre (komplette 18 S rDNA, partielle 28 S rDNA) und zwei mitochondriale (partielle 16 S rDNA und Cytochrome C Oxidase Untereinheit I), sowie moderne molekular systematische Analysemethoden angewandt. Das erste Kapitel der vorliegenden Arbeit befasst sich mit der Phylogenie der Opisthobranchia und der Evolution der Nahrungspräferenzen in dieser Gruppe. Basierend auf den vorliegenden Daten wird die Monophylie der Opisthobranchia eindeutig abgelehnt. Die Monophylie der Euthyneura (bestehend aus Opisthobranchia und Pulmonata) kann hingegen bestätigt werden. Hinsichtlich der Untergruppierungen der Opisthobranchia wird die Monophylie der Nudipleura, sowie deren Untergruppen Nudibranchia und Pleurobranchomorpha unterstützt. Zudem konnte die Monophylie der Umbraculida, Acochlidiacea und Pteropoda, inklusive der beiden Untergruppen Gymnosomata und Thecosomata, nachgewiesen werden. Die Monophylie der Sacoglossa und ihrer Untergruppen Oxynoacea und Placobranchacea wird nur unter der Annahme, dass Cylindrobulla keine eigene Untergruppierung bildet, sondern eine Gattung der Oxynoacea darstellt, unterstützt. Die Cephalaspidea sind ebenfalls monophyletisch, wenn akzeptiert wird, dass die Runcinacea eine eigene von den restlichen Cephalaspidea getrennte Gruppierung bilden. Die Aplysiomorpha (bestehend aus Aplysioidea und Akeroidea) sind nach den vorliegenden Ergebnissen paraphyletisch, weil Akera bullata (als Vertreter der Akeroidea) die Schwestergruppe einer monophyletischen Gruppierung aus Aplysioidea und Pteropoda bildet. Da aber nur eine Art der Akeroidea in die vorliegende Studie einbezogen werden konnte, bedarf dieses Ergebnis weiterer Untersuchungen. Die Nudipleura bilden die basalste evolutionäre Linie, die sich einzeln von den Euthyneura abspaltet. Dies legt eine frühe Trennung und separate Evolution dieser Gruppierung von den verbleibenden Gruppierungen nahe. Die übrigen Taxa bilden zwei Gruppen. Die erste umfasst mit Umbraculida, Cephalaspidea, Runcinacea, Aplysiomorpha und Pteropoda Untergruppierungen der Opisthobranchia. Innerhalb dieser Gruppe spalten sich zunächst die Umbraculida und dann die Cephalaspidea (ohne Runcinacea) ab. Die Runcinacea bilden die Schwestergruppe eines gut gestützten Taxons aus (paraphyletischen) Aplysiomorpha und Pteropoda. Diese Phylogenie der gesamten Gruppierung findet sich in allen Analysen, allerdings sind gute statistische Unterstützungswerte nicht immer gegeben. Zur zweiten Gruppe zählen die Pulmonata und die zu den Opisthobranchia gehörenden Sacoglossa und Acochlidiacea. Die Taxa Siphonarioidea, Sacoglossa und eine Gruppierung aus Hygrophila, Amphiboloidea, Eupulmonata und Acochlidiacea sind ebenfalls gut gestützt. In der vorliegenden Arbeit konnte zum ersten Mal ein Schwestergruppenverhältnis von Acochlidiacea und Eupulmonata nachgewiesen werden, da die Acochlidiacea bisher meist unaufgelöst innerhalb der Pulmonata gefunden wurden. Weitreichenden Einfluss auf den evolutionären Erfolg der Opisthobranchia hat ihre teils hochspezialisierte Anpassung an verschiedenartigste Nahrungsressourcen. Dabei werden auch solche Quellen als Nahrung verwendet, die für andere Organismen schmerzhaft oder sogar giftig sind. Die Evolution dieser spezialisierten Nahrungspräferenzen ist bislang allerdings weitgehend ungeklärt. Gleiches gilt für die möglichen Nahrungspräferenzen der letzten gemeinsamen Vorfahren der Opisthobranchia und ihrer einzelnen evolutionären Linien von denen ausgehend die heutige Vielfalt entstanden ist. Da in den phylogenetischen Analysen die Polyphylie der Opisthobranchia bestätigt wurde, werden in der vorliegenden Arbeit die Nahrungspräferenzen der monophyletischen Euthyneura rekonstruiert. Dies geschieht unter Nutzung des Programms BayesTraits, welches mittels Bayesianischer Methoden die Rekonstruktion angestammter Zustände ermöglicht. Die Ergebnisse weisen darauf hin, dass der letzte gemeinsame Vorfahre der Euthyneura mit großer Wahrscheinlichkeit ein Pflanzenfresser war. Dieser Befund bleibt auch bestehen, wenn die Acteonoidea, welche lange Zeit als basale Opisthobranchia betrachtet wurden und die in dieser Studie (gemeinsam mit den Rissoelloidea) die Schwestergruppe der Euthyneura bilden, in die Analyse mit einbezogen werden. Fleischfressende Taxa haben sich somit mindestens fünfmal unabhängig voneinander entwickelt (bei den Nudipleura, Umbraculida, Pteropoda und mindestens zweimal bei den Cephalaspidea). Kapitel zwei dieser Arbeit beschreibt die erste umfassende molekular systematische Untersuchung der Pleurobranchomorpha. Die bisherige Klassifikation der Gruppe, basierend auf morphologischen Merkmalen, konnte dabei nur zum Teil bestätigt werden. Die Monophylie der beiden Unterfamilien Pleurobranchaeidae und Pleurobranchidae konnte auf Grund der Position eines einzelnen Taxons (Euselenops luniceps) nicht bestätigt werden. Dieses Taxon wird basierend auf seiner Morphologie in die Pleurobranchaeidae gruppiert, in dieser Studie jedoch tief innerhalb der Pleurobranchidae eingeordnet. Die Pleurobranchidae werden in drei Gruppen eingeteilt: Berthellini, Pleurobranchini und Bathyberthellini. Die Ergebnisse dieser Studie offenbaren Paraphylie der Berthellini und der Gattung Berthella, wohingegen die Pleurobranchini monophyletisch sind. Der Status der Bathyberthellini kann nicht beurteilt werden, da nur ein Vertreter für die Analysen zur Verfügung stand. Die erstellte Phylogenie-Hypothese der Pleurobranchomorpha wurde genutzt, um die historische Biogeographie dieser Gruppierung zu untersuchen. Gegenwärtig gehen Theorien von einem antarktischen Ursprung der gesamten Nudipleura aus, was bedeutet, dass die Radiation ihrer Untergruppen (Nudibranchia und Pleurobranchomorpha) ebenfalls rund um die Antarktis stattgefunden hat. Vier unterschiedliche methodische Ansätze wurden genutzt (parsimonische, Bayesianische sowie Maximum likelihood), um die historische Biogeographie zu rekonstruieren. Die Resultate für die Pleurobranchomorpha waren nicht eindeutig, jedoch unterstützen die Ergebnisse einen antarktischen Ursprung der Pleurobranchidae, welche etwa 80 % aller rezenten Taxa umfassen. Die Datierung der Phylogenie mittels einer molekularen Uhr deutet auf eine Aufspaltung der Pleurobranchidae in das antarktische Taxon Tomthompsonia antarctica und den letzten gemeinsamen Vorfahren der übrigen Arten im frühen Oligozän (vor 30 - 34 Millionen Jahren) hin. Dieses Aufspaltungsereignis fällt mit zwei wesentlichen geologischen Vorkommnissen in der Antarktis zusammen. Zum einen mit dem Beginn der Gletscherbildung und zum anderen mit der Öffnung der Drake Passage und nachfolgender Entstehung einer polaren Strömung rund um die Antarktis (Antarctic Circumpolar Current - ACC). Diese relativ plötzlichen und dramatischen Änderungen des Klimas haben vermutlich zur Migration des letzten gemeinsamen Vorfahrens der meisten Pleurobranchidae heraus aus der Antarktis in wärmere Gebiete geführt. Diese Migration könnte über die Drake Passage Richtung West Atlantik und Ost Pazifik, sowie über die Süd-Tasmanische Erhebung in die Indo-West pazifische Region stattgefunden haben. Zudem könnte die Strömung des ACC die Verbreitung von Larven in den östlichen Atlantik verursacht haben. Kapitel drei der vorliegenden Arbeit widmet sich den Acteonoidea, deren phylogenetische Einordnung seit langem umstritten ist. Sie werden häufig als basale Opisthobranchia angesehen, weshalb sie in dieser Arbeit näher untersucht werden sollen, da molekular systematische Untersuchungen bislang fehlen. Die Ergebnisse dieser Arbeit legen eine Einordnung der Acteonoidea als Teil der „Lower Heterobranchia“ nahe, da sie in einem Schwestergruppenverhältnis zu den Rissoelloidea gefunden wurden. Die gegenwärtige Einteilung der Acteonoidea in drei Familien (Acteonidae, Aplustridae und Bullinidae) kann nicht bestätigt werden. Die Ergebnisse unterstützen eine Einteilung in zwei Familien. Entgegen vorheriger Annahmen scheint die Familie Bullinidae (mit der einzigen Gattung Bullina) eher Teil der Aplustridae zu sein, als eine eigene Familie zu bilden. Zudem findet sich ein Schwestergruppenverhältnis von Rictaxis punctocaelatus (zu den Acteonidae gehörend) und den Aplustridae, was zu einer Paraphylie der Acteonidae führt. Da Untersuchungen zur Morphologie von Rictaxis bisher fast völlig fehlten, wurde in dieser Arbeit die erste detaillierte Beschreibung der Morphologie und Histologie vorgenommen, um die Ergebnisse der phylogenetischen Analysen besser beurteilen zu können. Dabei wurde deutlich, dass Rictaxis sowohl mit Acteonidae, als auch mit Aplustridae gemeinsame Merkmale teilt. Darüber hinaus lassen sich aus den Ergebnissen dieses Kapitels Hinweise auf den plesiomorphen Zustand vieler Merkmale innerhalb der Acteonoidea ableiten. Zusammenfassend lässt sich feststellen, dass die vorliegende Arbeit durch die bislang umfassendsten Studien, hinsichtlich Taxonauswahl und Analysemethoden, zahlreiche und faszinierende neue Erkenntnisse zur Phylogenie und Evolution der Opisthobranchia liefert...|$|E

During head regeneration the L. sanguineus Pax- 6 homolog is expressed in the central nervous system, in the cerebral organ, and in the eye region.

Within each of the discrete populations, genetic variation is evident. Strong inter-population variation is evident, with discrete geographic clades being recognized for each extant group. The distinct spatial subdivision between east and west Australian populations of Nautilus are related to geographic and physical isolation over evolutionary time, and this has important fisheries management implications. The distinct geographic patterns of genetic structuring demonstrated by these data indicate the existence of discrete eastern and western Australian management units, and as such, these Nautilus populations should be managed discretely, as each has a high conservation value containing unique genetic variation...|$|R

Here, we isolated 1. 709 satellite DNA sequences from five Bovidae species belonging to Bovini: Bos taurus (BTA, cattle), Bos indicus (BIN, zebu), Bubalus bubalis (BBU, water buffalo) and Tragelaphini tribes: Taurotragus oryx (TOR, eland) and Tragelaphus euryceros (TEU, bongo).

40|$|Abstract Background Mammalian genomes are {{repositories}} of repetitive DNA sequences {{derived from}} transposable elements (TEs). Typically, TEs generate multiple, mostly inactive copies of themselves, {{commonly known as}} repetitive families or families of repeats. Recently, we proposed that families of TEs originate in small populations by genetic drift and that the origin of small subpopulations from larger populations can be fueled by biological innovations. Results We report three distinct groups of repetitive families preserved in the human genome that expanded and declined during the three previously described periods of regulatory innovations in vertebrate genomes. The first group originated prior to the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the mammalian and bird lineages and the second one during subsequent diversification of the mammalian lineages prior to the origin of eutherian lineages. The third group of families is primate-specific. Conclusions The observed correlation implies a relationship between regulatory innovations and the origin of repetitive families. Consistent with our previous hypothesis, it is proposed that regulatory innovations fueled the origin of new subpopulations in which new repetitive families became fixed by genetic drift.

40|$|AbstractEvidence from DNA {{sequencing}} studies strongly {{indicated that}} humans and chimpanzees are {{more closely related}} to each other than either is to gorillas [1 – 4]. However, precise details of the nature <b>of</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the lineage leading to humans from those leading to the African great apes have remained uncertain. The unique insertion sites of endogenous retroviruses, like those of other transposable genetic elements, should be useful for resolving phylogenetic relationships among closely related species. We identified a human endogenous retrovirus K (HERV-K) provirus that is present at the orthologous position in the gorilla and chimpanzee genomes, but not in the human genome. Humans contain an intact preintegration site at this locus. These observations provide very strong evidence that, for some fraction of the genome, chimpanzees, bonobos, and gorillas are {{more closely related to}} each other than they are to humans. They also show that HERV-K replicated as a virus and reinfected the germline of the common ancestor of the four modern species during the period of time when the lineages were separating and demonstrate the utility of using HERV-K to trace human evolution...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{comparative}} genomics approach {{to reconstruct the}} fate of genomic regulatory blocks (GRBs) and identify exonic remnants that have survived the disappearance of their host genes after whole-genome duplication (WGD) in teleosts, we discover a set of 38 candidate cis-regulatory coding exons (RCEs) with predicted target genes. These elements demonstrate <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> overlapping protein-coding and regulatory information after WGD in teleosts. We present evidence that the corresponding mammalian exons are still under both coding and non-coding selection pressure, are more conserved than other protein coding exons in the host gene and several control sets, and share key characteristics with highly conserved non-coding elements in the same regions. Their dual function is corroborated by existing experimental data. Additionally, we show examples of human exon remnants stemming from the vertebrate 2 R WGD. Our findings suggest that long-range cis-regulatory inputs for developmental genes {{are not limited to}} non-coding regions, but can also overlap the coding sequence of unrelated genes. Thus, exonic regulatory elements in GRBs might be functionally equivalent to those in non-coding regions, calling for a re-evaluation of the sequence space in which to look for long-range regulatory elements and experimentally test their activity...|$|R
40|$|SummaryThe {{origin of}} the {{chordate}} central nervous system (CNS) is unknown. One theory is that a CNS was present in the first bilaterian and that it gave rise to both the ventral cord of protostomes and the dorsal cord of deuterostomes (reviewed in [1]). Another theory (reviewed in [2]) proposes that the chordate CNS arose by a dramatic process of dorsalization and internalization from a diffuse nerve net coextensive with {{the skin of the}} animal, such as enteropneust worms (Hemichordata, Ambulacraria) are supposed to have [3]. We show here that juvenile and adult enteropneust worms in fact have a bona fide CNS, i. e., dense agglomerations of neurons associated with a neuropil, forming two cords, ventral and dorsal. The latter is internalized in the collar as a chordate-like neural tube. Contrary to previous assumptions, the greater part of the adult enteropneust skin is nonneural, although elements of the peripheral nervous system (PNS) are found there. We use molecular markers to show that several neuronal types are anatomically segregated in the CNS and PNS. These neuroanatomical features, whatever their homologies with the chordate CNS, imply that nervous system centralization predates the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> chordate and hemichordate lineages...|$|R
40|$|The bovine Growth Hormone gene (bGH) is an {{attractive}} candidate gene for milk production in cattle. Single-strand conformation polymorphisms at bGH were identified and used to define haplotype configurations at this gene in the Israeli Holstein dairy cattle population (Bos taurus) and in the parent animals of the International Bovine Reference Family Panel (a collection of B. taurus and B. indicus crosses). B. taurus and B. indicus haplotypes at the bGH gene differed qualitatively, confirming the previously proposed long <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> these cattle subraces. Only {{a small number of}} bGH haplotypes were present in the Israel Holstein population. One of the haplotypes, apparently of B. indicus origin, was found to have a highly significant positive effect on milk protein percentage. This illustrates the utility of the haplotype approach for uncovering candidate gene involvement in quantitative genetic variation in agricultural populations. The strong effect of an indicine haplotype in a taurine background raises the possibility that indicine alleles at other candidate genes may comprise a genetic resource for improvement of taurine populations.

The hypaxial portion contains some highly derived musculature that is functionally as well as morphologically well differentiated in all the gnathostome species. In contrast, the trunk muscles of agnathan lampreys lack these distinctions and any semblance of limb muscles. Therefore, the lamprey myotomes probably represent a primitive condition compared with gnathostomes. In this review, we compare the patterns of expression of some muscle-specific genes between the lamprey and gnathostomes. Although the cellular and tissue morphology of lamprey myotomes seems uniform and undifferentiated, some of the muscle-specific genes are expressed in a spatially restricted manner. The lamprey Pax 3 / 7 gene, a cognate of gnathostome Pax 3, is expressed only at the lateral edge of the myotomes and in the hypobranchial muscle, which we presume is homologous to the gnathostome hypobranchial muscle. Thus, the emergence of some part of a hypaxialspecific gene regulatory cascade might have evolved before the agnathan/gnathostome divergence, or before the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> epaxial and hypaxial muscles.

40|$|In North America, tick-borne {{relapsing}} fever {{is caused by}} the species Borrelia hermsii, B. parkeri, and B. turicatae, which are transmitted to humans through the bite of the respective infected tick vectors. Here we describe the identification and functional characterization of a surface lipoprotein of B. parkeri, designated BpcA, that binds the human complement regulators factor H and factor H-related protein 1 and, simulta-neously, the host protease plasminogen. In contrast, the homologous B. turicatae protein failed to bind human factor H and factor H-related protein 1 but retained its plasminogen binding capacity. Factor H bound to BpcA maintains its regulatory capacity to control C 3 b deposition and C 3 convertase activity. Ectopic expression of BpcA in a serum-sensitive B. burgdorferi strain protects transformed cells from complement-mediated killing. Furthermore, bound plasminogen/plasmin endows B. parkeri and B. turicatae with the potential to degrade extracellular matrix components. These findings expand our understanding of the putative recent <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> Borrelia parkeri and Borrelia turicatae, provide evidence that B. parkeri differs from B. turicatae in its ability to resist complement attack, and may help in understanding the pathological processes underlying tick-borne {{relapsing fever}}.

40|$|Topoisomerase-II accumulates at centromeres during prometaphase, {{where it}} {{resolves}} the DNA catenations {{that represent the}} last link between sister chromatids. Previously, using approaches including etoposide-mediated topoisomerase-II cleavage, we mapped centromeric domains in trypanosomes, early branching eukaryotes in which chromosome segregation is poorly under-stood. Here, we show that in bloodstream form Trypanosoma brucei, RNAi-mediated depletion of topoisomerase-IIa, but not topoisomerase-IIb, results in the abolition of centromere-localized activity and is lethal. Both phenotypes can be rescued by expression of the corresponding enzyme from T. cruzi. Therefore, processes which govern centromere-specific topoisomerase-II accumulation/activation have been functionally conserved within trypanosomes, despite the long <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> these species and differ-ences in centromeric DNA organization. The vari-able carboxyl terminal region of topoisomerase-II has {{a major role in}} regulating biological function. We therefore generated T. brucei lines expressing T. cruzi topoisomerase-II truncated at the carb-oxyl terminus and examined activity at centro-meres after the RNAi-mediated depletion of the endogenous enzyme. A region necessary for nuclear localization was delineated to six residues. In other organisms, sumoylation of topoisomerase-II {{has been shown to be}} necessary for regulated chromosome segregation. Evidence that we present here suggests that sumoylation of the T. brucei enzyme is not required for centromere-specific cleavage activity...|$|R
40|$|Voltage-dependent sodium {{channels}} have {{a decisive}} {{role in the}} generation of action potentials (AP) in many types of cells. In addition to the fast inactivating Na-current, associated with AP generation, the Na-channel can {{give rise to a}} noninactivating or persistent Na-current. The latter current generally comprises up to 5 % of the transient current having important physiological consequences. It was established that persistent Na-currents have functional significance in setting the membrane potential in a subthreshold range regulating by this way dendritic depolarisations, repetitive firing and enhancing synaptic transmission. Voltage dependent sodium channel genes have been identified in a variety of invertebrates, as well as mammalian and nonmammalian vertebrates. It has been established that the biophysical properties, pharmacology and gene organization of invertebrate sodium channels are largely similar to the vertebrate ones, supporting the view that the ancestral sodium channel was established before the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the invertebrates from the vertebrates. Although different isoforms of voltage sensitive Na-channels have now been identified the mechanism for persistent current remains controversial. An important yet unanswered question is whether persistent and fast inactivating Na-currents arise from different sets of sodium channels or whether the persistent Na-current results from different gating of the same channel type. The aim of the present review is to discuss the origin and the function of the persistent current, focusing on data derived from an invertebrate animal...|$|R
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of the pig (Sus scrofa) mitochondrial genome, containing 16 613 bp, is presented in this report. The genome is not a specific length {{because of the presence}} of the variable numbers of tandem repeats, 5 '-CGTGCGTACA in the displacement loop (D-loop). Genes responsible for 12 S and 16 S rRNAs, 22 tRNAs, and 13 protein-coding regions are found. The genome carries very few intergenic nucleotides with several instances of overlap between protein-coding or tRNA genes, except in the D-loop region. For evaluating the possible evolutionary relationships between Artiodactyla and Cetacea, the nucleotide substitutions and amino acid sequences of 13 protein-coding genes were aligned by pairwise comparisons of the pig, cow, and fin whale. By comparing these sequences, we suggest that there is a closer relationship between the pig and cow than that between either of these species and fin whale. In addition, the accumulation of transversions and gaps in pig 12 S and 16 S rRNA genes was compared with that in other eutherian species, including cow, fin whale, human, horse, and harbor seal. The results also reveal a close phylogenetic relationship between pig and cow, as compared to fin whale and others. Thus, according to the sequence differences of mitochondrial rRNA genes in eutherian species, the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> pig and cow occurred about 53 - 60 million years ago.

40|$|Hybridization between {{distinct}} {{species of}} animals and subsequent genetic introgression plays a considerable role in the speciation process {{and the emergence of}} adaptive characters. Fitness of between-species hybrids usually sharply decreases with the divergence time of the concerned species and the divergence depth, which still allows for a successful crossing differs among principal clades of vertebrates. Recently, a review of hybridization events among distinct lizard species revealed that lizards belong to vertebrates with a highly developed ability to hybridize. In spite of this, reliable reports of experimental hybridizations between genetically fairly divergent species are only exceptional. Here, we show the results of the crossing of two distinct allopatric species of eyelid geckos possessing temperature sex determination and lacking sex chromosomes: Eublepharis macularius distributed in Pakistan/Afghanistan area and E. angramainyu, which inhabits Mesopotamia and adjacent areas. We demonstrated that F 1 hybrids were viable and fertile, and the introgression of E. angramainyu genes into the E. macularius genome can be enabled via a backcrossing. The examined hybrids (except those of the F 2 generation) displayed neither malformations nor a reduced survival. Analyses of morphometric and coloration traits confirmed phenotypic distinctness of both parental species and their F 1 hybrids. These findings contrast with long-term geographic and an <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the studied species. Thus, the occurrence of fertile hybrids of comparably divergent species, such as E. angramainyu and E. macularius, may also be expected in other taxa of squamates.

However, alphaherpesviruses, roseoloviruses, and lymphocryptoviruses, as well as rhadinoviruses, that naturally infect Mus musculus (house mouse) and other Old World mice are unknown. To identify hitherto-unknown rodent-associated herpesviruses, we captured M. musculus, R. norvegicus, and 14 other rodent species in several locations in Germany, the United Kingdom, and Thailand. Samples of trigeminal ganglia, dorsal root ganglia, brains, spleens, and other organs, as well as blood, were analyzed with a degenerate panherpesvirus PCR targeting the DNA polymerase (DPOL) gene. Herpesvirus-positive samples were subjected to a second degenerate PCR targeting the glycoprotein B (gB) gene. The sequences located between the partial DPOL and gB sequences were amplified by long-distance PCR and sequenced, resulting in a contiguous sequence of approximately 3. 5 kbp. By DPOL PCR, we detected 17 novel betaherpesviruses and 21 novel gammaherpesviruses but no alphaherpesvirus. Of these 38 novel herpesviruses, 14 were successfully analyzed by the complete bigenic approach. Most importantly, the first gammaherpesvirus of Mus musculus was discovered (Mus musculus rhadinovirus 1 [MmusRHV 1]). This virus {{is a member of}} a novel group of rodent gammaherpesviruses, which is clearly distinct from murine herpesvirus 68 -like rodent gammaherpesviruses. Multigenic phylogenetic analysis, using an 8 -kbp locus, revealed that MmusRHV 1 diverged from the other gammaherpesviruses soon after the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> Epstein-Barr virus-like lymphocryptoviruses from human herpesvirus 8 -like rhadinoviruses and alcelaphine herpesvirus 1 -like macaviruses...|$|R

In 1978, NASA launched the Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer, which {{was able to}} measure the ultraviolet radiation reaching Earth's surface. Jablonski and Chaplin took the spectrometer's global ultraviolet measurements and compared them with published data on skin color in indigenous populations from more than 50 countries. There was an unmistakable correlation: The weaker the ultraviolet light, the fairer the skin. Rogers et al. (2004) performed {{an examination of the}} variation in MC1R nucleotide sequences for people of different ancestry and compared the sequences of chimpanzees and humans from various regions of the Earth. Rogers concluded that, at the time <b>of</b> the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> chimpanzees and humans, the common ancestors of all humans had light skin that was covered by dark hair. Additionally, our closest extant relative, the chimpanzee, has light skin covered by thick body hair. Over time human hair disappeared to allow better heat dissipation through sweating and the skin tone grew darker to increase the epidermal permeability barrier and protect from folate depletion due to the increased exposure to sunlight. When humans started to migrate away from the tropics, there was less-intense sunlight, partly due to clothing to protect against cold weather. Under these conditions there was less photodestruction of folate, and so the evolutionary pressure stopping lighter-skinned gene variants from surviving was reduced. In addition, lighter skin is able to generate more vitamin D (cholecalciferol) than darker skin, so it would have represented a health benefit in reduced sunlight if there were limited sources of vitamin D. The genetic mutations leading to light skin experienced selective pressure due to settlement in northern latitudes.|$|R
40|$|A {{new family}} of related {{endogenous}} proviruses, existing at 50 to 100 copies per haploid genome and distinguishable by remarkably short long terminal repeats, {{has been described}} for domestic chickens (Gallus gallus subsp domesticus). In this communication, by using Southern blot analysis and probes derived from both internal viral sequences and locus-specific, cellular flanking sequences, we studied the genetic distribution of this family of moderately repetitive avian endogenous retroviruses within the genomes of four Gallus species. Eight inbred lines of domestic chickens, the evolutionary progenitor to the domestic chicken (red jungle fowl), and two more distantly related species (grey and green jungle fowl) were studied. All Gallus species harbored this class of elements, although the different lines of domestic chickens and different species of jungle fowl bore distinguishable complements of the proviral loci. Jungle fowl appeared to have fewer copies than domestic chickens. For three randomly isolated proviral loci, domestic chickens (G. gallus subsp. domesticus) and red jungle fowl (G. gallus subsp. gallus) showed only a proviral state, whereas the most primitive and divergent of the jungle fowl, the green jungle fowl (G. varius), consistently demonstrated only preintegration states or disparate alleles. The presence of this family in all Gallus species and of related sequences in other genera suggests that a primordial founding integration event occurred prior to the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> Gallus species and possibly related genera. Additionally, at least one proviral locus has been acquired subsequent to speciation, indicating that this family was actively infectious after the primary founding event. This conserved, repetitive proviral family appears to represent the vestigial remnant of an avian retrovirus class related to and evolutionarily more ancient than the Rous-associated virus- 0 family of avian endogenous retroviruses...|$|R
40|$|Background: Firmicutes {{have the}} {{capacity}} to remove excess nitrate from the environment via either denitrification, dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium or both. The recent renewed interest in their nitrogen metabolism has revealed many interesting features, the most striking being their wide variety of dissimilatory nitrate reduction pathways. In the present study, nitrous oxide production from Bacillus licheniformis, a ubiquitous Gram-positive, spore-forming species with many industrial applications, is investigated. Results: B. licheniformis has long been considered a denitrifier but physiological experiments on three different strains demonstrated that nitrous oxide is not produced from nitrate in stoichiometric amounts, rather ammonium is the most important end-product, produced during fermentation. Significant strain dependency in end-product ratios, attributed to nitrite and ammonium, and medium dependency in nitrous oxide production were also observed. Genome analyses confirmed the lack of a nitrite reductase to nitric oxide, the key enzyme of denitrification. Based on the gene inventory and building on knowledge from other non-denitrifying nitrous oxide emitters, hypothetical pathways for nitrous oxide production, involving NarG, NirB, qNor and Hmp, are proposed. In addition, all publically available genomes of B. licheniformis demonstrated similar gene inventories, with specific duplications of the nar operon, narK and hmp genes as well as NarG phylogeny supporting the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> previously described distinct BALI 1 and BALI 2 lineages. Conclusions: Using physiological and genomic data we have demonstrated that the common soil bacterium B. licheniformis does not denitrify but is capable of fermentative dissimilatory nitrate/nitrite reduction to ammonium (DNRA) with concomitant production of N 2 O. Considering its ubiquitous nature and non-fastidious growth in the lab, B. licheniformis is a suitable candidate for further exploration of the actual mechanism of N 2 O production in DNRA bacteria and its relevance in situ...|$|R

The length, however, is not absolute due to pronounced heteroplasmy caused by variable numbers of two types of repetitive motifs in the control region. The sequence of the repeats is (a) 5 '-CACACCCA and (b) 5 '-TGCGCGCA, respectively. The order of (a) and (b) can be expressed as {n[2 (a) +(b) ]+m(a) }. In 32 different clones analyzed the number of n and m ranged from 0 to 9 and 1 to 7. The two rRNA genes, the 13 peptide-coding genes, and the 22 tRNA genes of the donkey and the horse, Equus caballus, were compared in detail. Total nucleotide difference outside the control region was 6. 9 %. Nucleotide difference between peptide-coding genes ranged from 6. 4 % to 9. 4 % {{with a mean of}} 8. 0 %. In the inferred protein sequences of the 13 peptide-coding genes the amino acid difference was 0. 2 - 8. 8 %, and the mean for the 13 concatenated amino acid sequences was 1. 9 %. In the 22 tRNA genes, the mean difference was 3. 5 %, and that in the two rRNA genes was 4. 1 %. The mtDNA differences between the donkey and the horse suggest that the <b>evolutionary</b> <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the two species occurred approximate to 9 million years ago. Analyses of differences among the mtDNAs of three other species-pairs, harbor seal/grey seal, fin whale/blue whale, and Homo/common chimpanzee, showed that the relative evolutionary rate of individual peptide-coding genes varies among different species-pairs and modes of comparison. The findings show that the superimposition of sequence data of one lineage for resolving and dating evolutionary divergences of other lineages should be performed with caution unless based on comprehensive data...|$|R
40|$|Musca domestica larvae present two {{different}} digestive chymotryptic activities {{found in the}} posterior midgut (PMG) : one major soluble activity in the lumen and another minor present in cell membrane fractions. Both soluble and membrane-bound chymotryptic activities have different half lives of thermal inactivation (46 degrees C) in the presence and absence of 10 mM Triton X- 100, indicating that they are {{two different}} molecular species. Purified soluble chymotryptic activity has pH optimum 7. 4 and a molecular mass of 28 kDa in SDS-PAGE. It does not cleave short substrates, such as Suc-F-MCA, preferring longer substrates, such as Suc-AAPF-MCA, with a primary specificity (kcat/Km) for Phe rather than Tyr and Leu residues. In-gel activity revealed a unique band against S-AAPF-MCA with the same migration as purified chymotrypsin. One chymotrypsinogen-like sequence (MdChy 1) was sequenced, cloned and recombinantly expressed in Escherichia coli (DE 3) Star. MdChy 1 is expressed in the proximal posterior midgut (PMG 1), as seen by RT-PCR. Expression analysis of other chymotrypsin genes revealed genes expressed at the anterior midgut (AMG) and PMG. Western blot of M. domestica midgut tissues using anti-MdChy 1 antiserum showed a single band in samples from AMG and PMG, co-migrating with recombinant and purified enzymes. Immunogold labeling corresponding to Mdchy 1 was found in small vesicles (thus indicating exocytosis) and in the lumen of AMG and PMG, corroborating the existence of two similar groups of chymotrypsins. Transcriptomes of M. domestica AMG and whole midgut prepared by pyrosequencing disclosed 41 unique sequences of chymotrypsin-like enzymes (19 probably functional), from which MdChy 1 is highly expressed.

40|$|The Jan Mayen {{microcontinent}} was as {{a result}} of two major North Atlantic <b>evolutionary</b> cornerstones—the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> Greenland from Norway (~ 54 Ma), accompanied by voluminous volcanic activity, and the jump of spreading from the Aegir to the Kolbeinsey ridge (~ 33 Ma), which resulted in the <b>separation</b> <b>of</b> the microcontinent itself from Eastern Greenland (~ 24 Ma). The resulting eastern and western sides of the Jan Mayen microcontinent are respectively volcanic and non-volcanic rifted margins. Until now the northern boundary of the microcontinent was not precisely known. In order to locate this boundary, two combined refraction and reflection seismic profiles were acquired in 2006 : one trending S–N and consisting of two separate segments south and north of the island of Jan Mayen respectively, and the second one trending SW–NE east of the island. Crustal P-wave velocity models were derived and constrained using gravity data collected during the same expedition. North of the West Jan Mayen Fracture Zone (WJMFZ) the models show oceanic crust that thickens from west to east. This thickening is explained by an increase in volcanic activity expressed as a bathymetric high and most likely related to the proximity of the Mohn ridge. East of the island and south of the WJMFZ, oceanic Layers 2 and 3 have normal seismic velocities but above normal average crustal thickness (~ 11 km). The similarity of the crustal thickness and seismic velocities to those observed on the conjugate Møre margin confirm the volcanic origin of {{the eastern side of the}} microcontinent. Thick continental crust is observed in the southern parts of both profiles. The northern boundary of the microcontinent is a continuation of the northern lineament of the East Jan Mayen Fracture Zone. It is thus located farther north than previously assumed. The crust in the middle parts of both models, around Jan Mayen island, is more enigmatic as the data suggest two possible interpretations—Icelandic type of oceanic crust or thinned and heavily intruded continental crust. We prefer the first interpretation but the latter cannot be completely ruled out. We infer that the volcanism on Jan Mayen is related to the Icelandic plume...|$|R
