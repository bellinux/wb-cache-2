5000|$|Discovery's payload bay {{doors were}} closed at 14:13 UTC, {{and the crew}} began <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> at 16:00 UTC. <b>Fluid</b> <b>loading</b> is a {{procedure}} that involves drinking high salt content fluids, which allows the astronauts {{to adjust to the}} return to gravity, and reduces the chance of hypotension upon returning to Earth. Shortly after 16:00 UTC, the crew began to get into their launch and entry suits, and ingress into their respective seats for landing. At 16:50 UTC, Entry Flight Director Bryan Lunney gave the crew the [...] "go" [...] for deorbit burn. The initiation of the burn committed Discovery to landing. The burn was initiated at 16:59 UTC, and was one minute and 53 seconds in duration. The deorbit burn is performed while the orbiter is facing opposite its direction of travel, which allows the engines to act as a braking system, slowing its speed by approximately 215 ft/s. After the burn, the remaining propellant in the orbiter's maneuvering thrusters was dumped overboard, at 17:13 UTC. Discovery began to feel the effects of gravity around 400000 ft, as it traveled above the North Pacific Ocean at 17:30 UTC. As the orbiter descended, Melroy initiated a series of [...] "rolls", and roll reversals, which serve to create friction and bleed off additional speed. At 17:40 UTC, Discovery entered the United States, flying over Montana. At 17:53, the orbiter entered Florida, flying at a speed of 3500 mi/h km/h, and an altitude of 118000 ft.|$|E

Four CRT acquisition was made at each hemodynamic condition and a posteriori analyzed by two readers ([...] MR and MJL). The least significant change of the measure was 25  %. Consequently, responders (CRT-R) were defined as patients showing a reduction of CRT after the <b>fluid</b> <b>load</b> of at least 25  %. Others were defined as CRT-NR.

Nine healthy men were tested in 5 testing scenarios, with a progressive lower body negative pressure (LBNP) protocol performed before and after each scenario to measure the subjects’ cardiovascular responses to orthostasis. Subjects were tested in two 28 h HDBR conditions, without <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> (NFL) and with <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> (FL), {{as well as in}} three 4 -hour control conditions to isolate the effects of circadian rhythm, HDBR, and <b>fluid</b> <b>loading.</b> After 28 h NFL HDBR, plasma volume was reduced by 8 %. There were no symptoms of syncope during orthostatic testing following 28 h NFL HDBR, however cardiovascular deconditioning was apparent as there were significant increases in heart rate, reductions in central venous pressure, and reductions in portal vein diameter during LBNP testing. There were no changes in stroke volume, cardiac output, systemic vasoconstriction, cardiac measures, and arterial and cardiopulmonary baroreflex responses, and no evidence of splanchnic or venous pooling. This study also found that NASA’s <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> protocol was ineffective at restoring normovolemia after 28 h HDBR, as there were no differences in plasma volume between 28 h FL HDBR post and 28 h NFL HDBR post tests (p= 0. 22). Cardiovascular deconditioning was not prevented by <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> as the heart rate response remained elevated and central venous pressure remained reduced after 28 h FL HDBR.

40|$|AbstractIn {{the present}} study, the {{non-linear}} vibration of an elastic plate subjected to heavy <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> in an inclined magnetic field is investigated. The structural non-linearity, fluid non-linearity, {{and the effects}} of magnetic field are all incorporated in the formulations to derive the governing equation of the plate. The method of multiple scales is adopted to determine the eigenvalues and mode shapes of the linear vibration, and then the amplitude of the non-linear vibration response of the plate is calculated. Based on the assumptions of ordering and formulations of multiple scales, it can be concluded that the linear dynamic behavior of the plate under heavy <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> but weak near-resonant loading is influenced by the effects of the <b>fluid</b> <b>loading,</b> linear structural rigidity and linear magnetic field, furthermore, the non-linear dynamic behavior of the plate under heavy <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> but weak near-resonant loading is dominated and controlled by the effects of the <b>fluid</b> <b>loading,</b> non-linear structural rigidity and non-linear magnetic field. Both thick and thin plates are investigated; the contributions due to the structural non-linearity and acoustic linear radiation damping are of the same order for a rather thick plate. For a thin plate, the structural non-linearity completely controls the behavior of the plate, which implies that in this case the effect of <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> is considerably negligible. In general, it can be concluded that both the effects of magnetic field and structural non-linearity play important roles only on the first few modes of the plate...|$|E

40|$|Background: Sepsis-induced cardiac {{dysfunction}} may limit fluid responsiveness and the mechanism thereof remains unclear. Since cardiac function {{may affect the}} relative value of cardiac filling pressures, such as the recommended central venous pressure (CVP), versus filling volumes in guiding <b>fluid</b> <b>loading,</b> we studied these parameters as determinants of fluid responsiveness, according to cardiac function. Methods: A delta CVP-guided, 90 min colloid <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> protocol was performed in 16 mechanically ventilated patients with sepsis-induced hypotension and three 30 min consecutive <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> steps of about 450 mL per patient were evaluated. Global end-diastolic volume index (GEDVI), cardiac index (CI) and global ejection fraction (GEF) were assessed from transpulmonary dilution. Baseline and changes in CVP and GEDVI were compared among responding (CI increase ≥ 10 % and ≥ 15 %) and non-responding <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> steps, in patient with low (< 20 %, n = 9) and near-normal (≥ 20 %) GEF (n = 7) at baseline. Results: A low GEF was in line with other indices of impaired cardiac (left ventricular) function, prior to and after <b>fluid</b> <b>loading.</b> Of 48 <b>fluid</b> <b>loading</b> steps, 9 (of 27) were responding when GEF < 20 % and 6 (of 21) when GEF ≥ 20. Prior to <b>fluid</b> <b>loading,</b> CVP did not differ between responding and non-responding steps and levels attained were 23 higher in the latter, regardless of GEF (P = 0. 004). Prior to <b>fluid</b> <b>loading,</b> GEDVI (and CI) was higher in responding (1007 ± 306 mL/m 2) than non-responding steps (870 ± 236 mL/m 2) when GEF was low (P = 0. 002), but did not differ when GEF was near-normal. Increases in GEDVI were associated with increases in CI and fluid responsiveness, regardless of GEF (P < 0. 001). Conclusions: As estimated from transpulmonary dilution, about half of patients with sepsis-induced hypotension have systolic {{cardiac dysfunction}}. During dysfunction, cardiac dilation with a relatively high baseline GEDVI maintains fluid responsiveness by further dilatation (increase in GEDVI rather than of CVP) as in patients without dysfunction.

Material and Method: Patients who were admitted to a tertiary 7 -bed pediatric intensive care unit and underwent CRRT due to overhydration were included in the study. Results: The study was conducted with 15 girls (53. 6 %) and 13 boys (46. 4 %). The mean age was 61. 46 ± 56. 13 months (range, 2 - 183 months); the mean CRRT administration time was 20. 8 ± 14. 9 hours (range, 5 - 60 hours); and the mean percentage of fluid extracted from the body was 8. 43 ± 4. 51 % (range, 2. 5 - 20 %). CRRT was administered to 12 patients because of fluid overload (42. 9 %) and to 12 (57. 1 %) because of <b>fluid</b> <b>load</b> accompanied by uremia [...] There was a statistically significant difference between body weight, urea, and creatinine levels of patients before and after treatment (p= 0. 001). The mean proBNP level was 23. 306 ± 13. 943 pg/mL immediately before CRRT and the mean proBNP after CRRT was 22. 178 ± 15. 473 pg/mL. There was no statistically significant difference between the initial and final proBNP levels (p= 0. 756). With the exception of serum sodium levels, there was no correlation between the final proBNP levels and body weight, urea, and creatinine (p> 0. 05).

The analytical expression has been derived in which the flexible foundation effects are incorporated into a revised system stiffness matrix that is derived from the receptance matrix at mounting points. A typical case with a thin infinite plate as the foundation has been studied with the point and transfer receptances theoretically and numerically analysed in the case of light and heavy <b>fluid</b> <b>loading.</b> The results show that, compared with the rigid foundation, the force transmission is reduced and system natural frequencies are shifted.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a numerical model to predict the vibro-acoustic behavior of an externally <b>fluid</b> <b>loaded</b> shell with non-uniformly space stiffeners and transversal bulkheads. This model constitutes an extension of the existing semi-analytic capability in predicting the acoustics of axisymmetric structures. It is based on the circumferential admittance approach (CAA) which consists in substructuring the problem so that the <b>fluid</b> <b>loaded</b> shell constitutes one subsystem and the frames constitute other independent subsystems. These subsystems are coupled together by assembling the circumferential admittances that characterize each uncoupled subsystem. Different numerical approaches can be used to estimate these admittances. The standard finite element code is well adapted for evaluating the admittances of the internal frames whatever their cross-section geometries and material properties. Classical discretization methods such as finite elements and boundary elements are too time-consuming for the <b>fluid</b> <b>loaded</b> shell. To avoid this obstacle, three different approaches with different degrees of approximation are proposed to estimate the shell admittances. Comparisons with a reference case are proposed to evaluate the accuracy and the efficiency of each of these three approaches. With the optimal approach, CAA gives very good results in satisfactory computing time. It is well-adapted for analyzing the behavior of a submarine pressure hull in a wide frequency range of interest. (C) 2010 Acoustical Society of America. {[}DOI: 10. 1121 / 1. 3436526...|$|R
