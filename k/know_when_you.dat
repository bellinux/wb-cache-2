And the reason we pulled back – you <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> stop when you have two #1 records, it’s not really the greatest career move – but we did that because we love each other and we didn’t want to die in public. And I know for a fact in my heart that if we were to continue that I wouldn’t be on the phone right now talking to you. I wouldn’t have made it. I just wouldn’t have." ...|$|E
500|$|Christian Louboutin {{said that}} he would {{dedicate}} his time to creating some [...] "scene-stealing designs for the single's video", out of his appreciation for the song. According to Rap-Up, Lopez was scheduled to film the music video for the song in January 2010. She outlined the concept of the video in a radio interview, where she said: [...] "It's gonna be a lot of dancing, I definitely want to do some dancing because it's been a while and I want to do a dance video, and it's going to be really empowering. It's going to be about that woman, you <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have that moment when you realize you have to really get out of here that's the moment we're trying to cauterize in the video. Even when you know that it's gonna hurt later, you feel good about making the decision, so you're like [...] "I decided! I'm walking up out the house right now" [...] and that's the part we're gonna do in the video except I'm gonna dance my way out the house." ...|$|E

500|$|Parts II and III have {{a similar}} structure; an {{overarching}} narrative of the Fairchild family is interspersed with inset moral tales. Both are noticeably less evangelical than Part I. Part II begins with the recognition by the Fairchild parents that their children have [...] "a new and divine nature, which works against your evil natures, causing you to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have done wrong, and making you truly and deeply sorrowful when you have committed a sin." [...] Emily, Lucy and Henry have finally learned to discipline their own souls. Parts II and III focus {{to a greater extent}} on good breeding, virtuous consumption and one's duty to the poor than does Part I. One of the most important lessons that the children learn, for instance, is respect for their elders. Moreover, the gibbet to which the children had been taken to observe a rotting corpse and instructed regarding the spiritual perils of sibling rivalry in Part I, has disappeared in Part II; Henry and his father walk by the spot where it used to stand and note its absence.|$|E

After reaching the milestone, PewDiePie tweeted [...] "will delete tomorrow 5pm gmt," [...] in reference to his channel, before later uploading a celebratory video featuring fireworks. Ultimately, he did not delete his PewDiePie channel, and instead shut down the joke Jack septiceye2 channel, stating [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> make a joke and it just blows up way bigger than you'd imagined?" [...] PewDiePie's stunt received negative reception from Fortune. The publication's Mathew Ingram opined, [...] "this is just a temper tantrum by a man-baby who makes millions of dollars playing video games," [...] adding, [...] "at first glance, the video in which he threatens to delete his channel seems like the whining of a rich, entitled celebrity who has noticed that his videos aren’t getting as many views as they used to, and blames the platform for not supporting {{him as much as}} he thinks they should."

500|$|Matos was broadly {{critical}} of the game's multiplayer mode, though he singled out some elements, such as the maps, as well-designed. He disliked the connection to single-player mode, calling it [...] "a weird narrative tie-in", and was concerned that although the gameplay translates well into the multiplayer element, [...] "the entire experience may be too chaotic to enrapture a large audience...it doesn't feel deep enough to command {{much more than a}} furiously dedicated fan following". Simmons was more positive, saying that the multiplayer mode is [...] "a genuinely fresh addition...that successfully carries over many of the hallmarks of the much-loved single-player [...] ". He singled out Team Favor of the Gods as his favorite mode, but did not feel that the combat offered enough depth to make multiplayer [...] "a truly engaging experience", describing it instead as [...] "a curiosity that provides a few hours of enjoyment rather than being an essential addition". The review from Edge magazine described multiplayer mode as [...] "chaotic at first", with overwhelming options, but said that it becomes easier as players learn the levels. The Edge review identified the fixed camera system as an asset because [...] "you can always see exactly what's going on and fight your opponents instead of the viewpoint", and also praised the color-coding system, which [...] "effectively lets you <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have an opening and when to run".|$|E

500|$|Another {{possible}} lover was Bill Duckett. As a teenager, {{he lived}} on the same street in Camden and moved in with Whitman, living with him {{a number of years}} and serving him in various roles. Duckett was 15 when Whitman bought his house at 328 Mickle Street. From at least 1880, Duckett and his grandmother, Lydia Watson, were boarders, subletting space from another family at 334 Mickle Street. Because of this proximity, it is obvious that Duckett and Whitman met as neighbors. Their relationship was close, with the youth sharing Whitman's money when he had it. Whitman described their friendship as [...] "thick". Though some biographers describe him as a boarder, others identify him as a lover. Their photograph [...] is described as [...] "modeled on the conventions of a marriage portrait", part of a series of portraits of the poet with his young male friends, and encrypting male–male desire. Yet another intense relationship of Whitman with a young man was the one with Harry Stafford, with whose family Whitman stayed when at Timber Creek, and whom he first met when Stafford was 18, in 1876. Whitman gave Stafford a ring, which was returned and re-given {{over the course of a}} stormy relationship lasting several years. Of that ring, Stafford wrote to Whitman, [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> put it on there was but one thing to part it from me, and that was death." ...|$|E
500|$|Bassist Jeff Ament {{wrote the}} lyrics for two {{songs on the}} album ("Gods' Dice" [...] and [...] "Nothing as It Seems"), and Gossard for three ("Thin Air," [...] "Of the Girl" [...] and [...] "Rival"). The album is lyrically darker than the band's {{previous}} album Yield, with Gossard describing the lyrics as [...] "pretty somber." [...] Vedder addressed the social criticism contained in the album's lyrics by stating, [...] "I think what everyone's looking for, y'know, is freedom...That's part of being comfortable in your own skin. I know I {{had a problem with}} being told what to do, and had a problem with being mentally and physically constricted. All of humanity is searching for freedom and I think it's important to <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have it, too." [...] Ament stated that [...] "Gods' Dice" [...] is about [...] "judging anybody who has any sort of belief system whether they believe in God or not", and that [...] "Nothing as It Seems" [...] is about his childhood growing up in a rural area of Northern Montana. Vedder called [...] "Evacuation" [...] a [...] "song about change", and stated in an interview that the moral of [...] "Insignificance" [...] is [...] "the ineffectiveness of political struggle." [...] Vedder took inspiration from the 1999 World Trade Organization protests in Seattle when writing [...] "Grievance", and said the song is about the dangers of technology. Gossard has said that the song [...] "Rival" [...] is his reflection upon the 1999 Columbine High School massacre.|$|E

After arriving at the palace, Sòngyún told the emperor that he met Bodhidharma on the way. The emperor said Bodhidharma was already dead and buried and had Sòngyún arrested for lying. At Shaolin Monastery, the monks informed them that Bodhidharma was dead and had been buried in a hill behind the temple. The grave was exhumed and was found to contain a single shoe.

2500|$|Whilst {{discussing}} the record with Rolling Stone she discussed her selection of producers for the record, {{with a goal}} to create [...] "a unique record" [...] becoming the basis of her selection. After being asked whether there was anyone she wished to work with on the record, Roberts declared that she wanted Kate Bush. However, contacting Bush was difficult; after asking and hinting to her record label during the year she was producing the album, she found that nobody could establish communications. Electropop band Dragonette worked on the album, producing the second single from the album, [...] "Lucky Day". The band {{were among the first}} to work on the record. Roberts co-wrote the lyrics, saying: [...] "When I wrote 'Lucky Day' I had short hair and was really into '40s fashion. All of the 'woah woah woah woah' and the 'ah ha' really is a reflection of that." [...] She also stated when it came to the production of the track, early in 2011, that she wanted to produce a [...] "more downbeat dance record" [...] noting it was what she was into at that point". Roberts worked with producer Diplo, who co-produced the track [...] "Beat of My Drum", she explained whilst talking to The Guardian, [...] "I had to ring him [...] and… you <b>know</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> ring a boy for the first time? I knew I only had one chance, so I just fired at him. 'I want this, I want that, don't send it back like that. I'm going to send you the session again just so you've got it.' He reassured me a bit, and I put the phone down, thinking, it's not in my hands now". When Roberts received the track back from Diplo, she was too nervous to listen to it, as it meant so much to her. Whilst back in her hometown of Liverpool she put her younger brother and sister in the car with her, and after burning the track to a CD, drove to a deserted field and played it loudly. After positive responses from the pair, Roberts declared [...] "I'm so proud of it. I can't believe it's mine. The man is a genius". Roberts worked with producer Joseph Mount on the album, recording two songs. For years before the pair started work together, Mount had mentioned several times that he wished to work with Girls Aloud (Roberts' former group), and had sent [...] "short beats" [...] to her, including music which he thought the record label would approve of, as well as a wild-card style compilation. When the two started work in the studio, both of the tracks produced by Mount were chosen from the wild-card category, with lyrics written by Roberts, and the melodies in the tracks produced jointly.|$|E
