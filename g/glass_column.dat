The work highlights the issues recurring {{in the design}} of <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> in rapid diffusion in the transparent architecture such as: - flexural and torsional buckling; - long-term effects and effects related to the temperature; - glued connections between single panels. In the work expressions are given for the calculation of the loadcarrying capacity of columns. The cases of full connection and absence of connection between the panels are analyzed and discussed. The comparison between the analytical and the experimental results highlights {{that in the case of}} <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> with T cross-section failure in the glued section and torsional buckling effects strongly limit the load carrying capacity of members. In these cases the analytical prediction of load carrying capacity with analytical expressions available in the literature allows good prediction and highlights that particular care should be placed on the design of glued section...|$|R

40|$|Columns have a {{supporting}} function. If there are additional requirements such as transparency of building materials, components of glass are used. In load-bearing members mainly glasses with laminated cross sections and viscoelastic interlayer (especially PVB) are used. These <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> under axial compressive loads and possible horizontal shear loads are dimensioned against stability failure {{taking into account}} material specific properties of the glass and the interlayer. Normative rules for this are still lacking. This work is devoted developing of an appropriate analytical design method for the stability case buckling of monolithic and laminated <b>glass</b> <b>columns.</b> The basis of the design concept has already been established in the structural steel design calculation using European buckling curves {{as a function of}} non-dimensional slenderness. Considering the special features of glass (elastic structural behavior, high ratio of characteristic compressive strength to characteristic flexural strength) for thermally tempered monolithic <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> structural design calculation are developed for concentric and eccentric compression loads and verified by experimental and numerical investigations. In addition, stability analysis for centric compressive loads in combination with bending are presented for selected load cases. The derivation of partial safety factors completes the design methods. Moreover the design method is extended to <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> with laminated cross sections. For this purpose the temperature- and time-dependent composite action is considered by use of any shear modulus of the interlayer in the second-order stress equation and the analytically derived buckling curves.

50|$|Sedimentation {{potential}} {{is measured by}} attaching electrodes to a <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> filled with the dispersion of interest. A voltmeter is attached to measure the potential generated from the suspension. To account for different geometries of the electrode, the column is typically rotated 180 degrees while measuring the potential. This difference in potential through rotation by 180 degrees is twice the sedimentation potential. The zeta potential can be determined through measurement by sedimentation potential, as the concentration, conductivity of the suspension, density of the particle, and potential difference are known. By rotating the column 180 degrees, drift and geometry differences of the column can be ignored.|$|E
50|$|Like the Art Nouveau {{period before}} it, Art Deco was an {{exceptional}} period for fine glass and other decorative objects, {{designed to fit}} their architectural surroundings. The most famous producer of glass objects was René Lalique, whose works, from vases to hood ornaments for automobiles, became symbols of the period. He had made ventures into glass before World War I, designing bottles for the perfumes of François Coty, {{but he did not}} begin serious production of art glass until after World War I. In 1918, at the age of 58, he bought a large glass works in Combs-la-Ville and began to manufacture both artistic and practical glass objects. He treated glass as a form of sculpture, and created statuettes, vases, bowls, lamps and ornaments. He used demi-crystal rather than lead crystal, which was softer and easier to form, though not as lustrous. He sometimes used colored glass, but more often used opalescent glass, where part or the whole of the outer surface was stained with a wash. Lalique provided the decorative glass panels, lights and illuminated glass ceilings for the ocean liners SS Ile de France in 1927 and the SS Normandie in 1935, and for some of the first-class sleeping cars of the French railroads. At the 1925 Exposition of Decorative Arts, he had his own pavilion, designed a dining room with a table settling and matching glass ceiling for the Sèvres Pavilion, and designed a glass fountain for the courtyard of the Cours des Métier, a slender <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> which spouted water from the sides and was illuminated at night.|$|E
5000|$|The book {{is divided}} into two parts. In the first part, Cytowic {{describes}} his chance encounter during a dinner party on February 10, 1980 with MW, the [...] "Man Who Tasted Shapes." [...] Cytowic describes how his host reported that [...] "There aren't enough points on the chicken!" [...] and how this chance comment led to Cytowic's investigations of the neurological phenomenon of synesthesia. Early chapters include background information on how the brain is organized, drawn mainly from Paul D. MacLean's Triune Brain theory. Cytowic describes MW's synesthesia, noting the consistency of his reports, that such experiences are [...] "generic" [...] and consistent over time. [...] Chapters dealing with more scientific theories, data and experimentation are alternated with autobiographical and more personal chapters describing the historical details of Cytowic's investigations into synesthesia. [...] In order to explore the biological basis of synesthesia, Cytowic describes experiments in which he tested how MW's synesthesia was reduced by MW's daily routine of stimulants such as nicotine and caffeine and depressants such as alcohol. [...] In more intensive investigations of the effects of different psychoactive substances, Cytowic notes that stimulants, including a dose of amphetamine decreased the strength of MW's synesthesia, while amyl nitrite increased the strength of MW's synesthesia. [...] For example, MW reports that mint feels like a cool <b>glass</b> <b>column,</b> but that amyl nitrite led him to feel as if he were placing his hand among many glass columns. [...] Cytowic also summarizes work done with functional neuroimaging which showed unusually low cortical activation in MW. Based on these results, Cytowic proposes a theory in which synesthesia is a result of unusual processing in the limbic system and an overall decrease in cortical activation.|$|E

40|$|In {{the world}} of {{structural}} engineering glass is an innovative material. Compared to other conventional structural materials like concrete, steel and timber, it is especially the transparency property {{that makes it a}} valued material. Due to the increasing demand for transparency in contemporary architecture, much more structural components as beams, plates, portals and columns are developed in glass. Besides the transparency property, the brittleness of glass makes it essentially an unsafe structural material as the residual capacity is limited. Therefore, the structural <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> is still in its early phases of development. As architects and clients, in general, do not like columns, they are said to block the view and stand in the way. Engineers need to add columns to buildings to provide support. These conflicting desires can be solved by developing a more attractive column, a <b>glass</b> <b>column.</b> The aim of this research project was to focus on further knowledge and understanding of the structural design aspects specifically related to structural glass columns and, {{on the basis of these}} findings, to design a <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> as a structural element in a pavilion. The considered slender columns were assembled from rectangular monolithic flat glass plates into different configurations. An exploratory study to the design aspects of glass columns was performed by doing experiments. One-metre-high glass columns were assembled from glass plates 8 millimetres thick, 100 millimetres wide and 1000 millimetres long and glued with a two-component adhesive based on epoxy resin (Araldite 2000 PLUS 2013) into five different configurations. These columns were compressed by a test bench with felt as the interlayer material to distribute the stresses uniformly over the cross-sectional area. A thorough analysis of the columns and their structural behaviour resulted in four design aspects that should be considered in the design process of a structural glass column: - a difference in the vertical position between the assembled glass plates; - susceptibility to peak stresses at the edges of the glass column; - the stiffness properties of the glue; - imperfections like holes and scratches. A two-dimensional numerical model was developed to study two of the considered design aspects. The effect of a difference in the vertical position between the assembled glass plates (which results in protruding edges) and the stiffness properties of the glue on the stress development in the glass were studied. Another series of experiments was performed to study the effect of several design options on the load bearing capacity of the column. The experiments revealed that, among others, avoiding the chance of uneven loading due to a difference in the vertical position between the glass plates and applying an adhesive with low stiffness results in more uniformly distribution of the stresses over the <b>glass</b> <b>column.</b> Finally, the findings of the experimental and numerical investigations were integrated into the structural design of a <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> for a pavilion. The preliminary design of a pavilion, which consists of ten columns, served as a context for the structural glass columns (each four metres high). Two main aspects were distinguished in the design process of the column: the boundary connection system and the related cross-section. Finally, a safety concept was developed for the monolithic <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> by applying an outer layer of safety glazing around the structural <b>glass</b> <b>column.</b> To conclude, from this research it is found that different design aspects play an important role in the bearing capacity of slender glass columns assembled from rectangular monolithic flat glass plates. On the basis of the experimental and numerical results the most relevant aspects related to designing a structural <b>glass</b> <b>column</b> were listed in the report.

40|$|Extensive {{research}} shows that not many examples exist regarding <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> and the main reason is that safety is difficult to guarantee in a design. Recent technologies however have now created sufficient boundary conditions to provide this safety in a design. Two <b>glass</b> <b>columns</b> have therefore been designed to replace the concrete pillars which are now present in the Berlage Zaal in the faculty of architecture at the TU in Delft. The column consists of 54 stacked cast bricks with a maximum of 10 kg each. A flowing interlocking mechanism generates a strong behavior of the corresponding cross sections and more important, it makes the columns demountable rather than glued permanently. Over {{the height of the}} column, the cross section varies from wide hollow to narrow solid parts, based on several design criteria. Instead of a permanent glue, a Vivak interlayer is chosen to transfer the loads from one glass surface into the other. Special end connections are detailed to provide a good distribution of forces throughout the column. From this design, nine bricks have been fabricated in order to conduct a compressive test. The entire fabrication process is thoroughly addressed and shows a hands-on approach to learn how to design with glass. From the MDF mold until the glass specimens, all steps are discussed. Seven of these nine bricks are used for a compression test set-up in order to analyze the failure behavior of this design. The broken shards of glass are analyzed and documented in order to draw conclusions and to evaluate the design.
