5|$|The {{end of the}} war {{drastically}} reduced military investment in the island. Increasing enforcement of gambling laws and the growth of Las Vegas, Nevada as a competitive center of <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> entertainment put pressure on the gaming industry on the island. Finally in 1957, Texas Attorney General Will Wilson and the Texas Rangers began a massive campaign of raids which disrupted <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> prostitution in the city. As these vice industries crashed, so did tourism, taking the rest of the Galveston economy with it. Neither the economy nor the culture of the city was the same afterward.|$|E
5|$|Another {{indirect}} {{effect of the}} boom was the growth of <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> prostitution in many communities. These activities had not been uncommon in Texas before the boom, but the wealth brought by the oil industry, as well as difficulties in enhancing the laws and the law enforcement agencies, created many new opportunities for illegal businesses and organized crime. Many communities developed casino and red-light districts; notably the gaming empire in Galveston, which attracted wealthy businessmen from Houston and lasted into the 1950s, was the longest lasting of all of these. Prostitution, which had always been present in the state, flourished in the boom towns, which were crowded with single men earning relatively high wages. The onset of Prohibition and the state government's reluctance to enforce vice laws only encouraged the growth of <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> bootlegging during this period.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. They tend to be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E

40|$|Investigating how <b>gambling</b> {{frequency}} <b>and</b> perceptions towards <b>gambling</b> {{relate to}} gambling problems has direct relevance for {{prevention and treatment}} programs. Accordingly, this study explored {{the relationship between a}} diverse group of gambling beliefs, the intention to <b>gamble,</b> <b>gambling</b> frequency, <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> problems. To facilitate this, the Theory of Planned Behaviour (TPB) was employed to model the influence of gambling attitudes (e. g., the expected emotional and financial outcomes from gambling), social norms (e. g., perceived approval <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> behaviour of significant others) and cognitive biases (confidence in the ability to determine the outcome of gambling) on the intention to <b>gamble,</b> <b>gambling</b> frequency, <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> problems. Two hundred and one volunteers completed a questionnaire that assessed these social-cognitive factors <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> behaviours. Consistent with expectations, the path analysis revealed the TPB determinants predicted <b>gambling</b> frequency <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> problems, respectively. Interestingly though, there was the direct path between the intention to <b>gamble</b> <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> problems, <b>and</b> attitudes <b>and</b> <b>gambling</b> frequency. The potential implications for these findings are discussed...|$|R

5|$|Dopaminergic {{medications}} {{that are used}} to treat Parkinson's disease are sometimes associated with the development of a dopamine dysregulation syndrome, which involves the overuse of dopaminergic medication and medication-induced compulsive engagement in natural rewards like <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> sexual activity.

5|$|After {{the loss}} of these two railway {{executive}} positions, Beauregard spent time briefly {{at a variety of}} companies and civil engineering pursuits, but his personal wealth became assured when he was recruited as a supervisor of the Louisiana Lottery in 1877. He and former Confederate general Jubal Early presided over lottery drawings and made numerous public appearances, lending the effort some respectability. For 15 years the two generals served in these positions, but the public became opposed to government-sponsored <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> the lottery was closed down by the legislature.|$|E
5|$|Between 1880 and 1895 {{the city}} {{experienced}} a huge rise in corruption, as crime bosses, such as Soapy Smith, worked {{side by side}} with elected officials and the police to control elections, <b>gambling,</b> <b>and</b> bunco gangs. The city also experienced a depression in 1893 after the crash of silver prices. In 1887, the precursor to the international charity United Way was formed in Denver by local religious leaders who raised funds and coordinated various charities to help Denver's poor. By 1890, Denver had grown to be the second-largest city west of Omaha, Nebraska. In 1900, whites represented 96.8% of Denver's population.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} 1930s, Wijnhamer, known as PahWongso, was {{recognised}} in West Java for his promotion of social causes. These included promoting monogamy {{and faith in}} western medicine, as well as combating <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> the use of opium and alcohol. In conveying his messages he often used the Sundanese wayang golek (a form of rod puppet), as the local people were generally unable to read. He was able to speak Dutch, Malay, and Javanese fluently, and had some command of Chinese and Japanese. This social work was funded predominantly from PahWongso's day job, selling fried peanuts (kacang goreng).|$|E

5|$|Dawson {{remained}} relatively lawful, {{protected by the}} Canadian NWMP, which meant that <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> prostitution were accepted while robbery and murder were kept low.

The extreme climate and remoteness of the region in general meant that supplies and communication {{with the outside world}} including news and mail were scarce.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Charles I, the gentry took an {{increased}} interest as patrons and occasionally as players. A big attraction for them was the opportunity that the game offered for <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> this escalated {{in the years following}} the Restoration when cricket in London and the south-eastern counties of England evolved into a popular social activity. Its patrons staged lucrative eleven-a-side matches featuring the earliest professional players. Meanwhile, English colonists had introduced cricket to North America and the West Indies, and the sailors and traders of the East India Company had taken it to the Indian subcontinent.|$|E

50|$|When the Romeos disbanded, <b>Gamble</b> <b>and</b> Huff went on {{to start}} {{one of the first}} {{iterations}} of Philadelphia International Records (which they named Excel <b>and</b> <b>Gamble)</b> after a visit to Motown Records in Detroit, to scope out the Motown setup. The success of their biggest signing, The Intruders, brought attention to <b>Gamble</b> <b>and</b> Huff, which allowed them to create Neptune Records in 1969. Neptune Records, a more ambitious project for the duo, was financed by Chess Records Group, and allowed them to sign later Philadelphia International Records artists The O'Jays and The Three Degrees. When Chess Records Group's management changed hands in 1969, Neptune Records folded. With the collapse of Neptune Records, <b>Gamble</b> <b>and</b> Huff transferred their signed artists onto a new project, Philadelphia International Records. Looking to attract new black acts to their label, but without the in-house know-how, Columbia Records was convinced to sign an exclusive production contract with <b>Gamble</b> <b>and</b> Huff's new Philadelphia International Records.|$|R

5|$|In Mackay's account, the panicked tulip speculators {{sought help}} from the {{government}} of the Netherlands, which responded by declaring that anyone who had bought contracts to purchase bulbs in the future could void their contract by payment of a 10 percent fee.

The mania finally ended, Mackay says, with individuals stuck with the bulbs they held {{at the end of the}} crash‚Äîno court would enforce payment of a contract, since judges regarded the debts as contracted through <b>gambling,</b> <b>and</b> thus not enforceable by law.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} quarter of the 18th century, more {{information}} about cricket became available as the growing newspaper industry took an interest. The sport noticeably began to spread throughout England as the century went on. By 1725, significant patrons such as Edwin Stead, Charles Lennox, 2nd Duke of Richmond and Sir William Gage were forming teams of county strength in Kent and Sussex. The earliest known great players, including William Bedle and Thomas Waymark, were active. Cricket was attracting large, vociferous crowds and the matches were social occasions at which <b>gambling</b> <b>and</b> alcoholic drinks were additional attractions.|$|E
