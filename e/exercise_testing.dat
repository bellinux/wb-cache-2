25|$|In 1950 Bruce {{joined the}} University of Washington, where he {{continued}} {{research on the}} single-stage test, particularly {{as a predictor of}} the success of surgery for valvular or congenital heart disease. Later he developed the multistage test, consisting of several stages of progressively greater workloads. It was this multistage test, a description of which was first published in 1963, that became known as the Bruce Protocol. In the initial paper, Bruce reported that the test could detect signs of such conditions as angina pectoris, a previous heart attack, or a ventricular aneurysm. Bruce his and colleagues also demonstrated that <b>exercise</b> <b>testing</b> was useful in screening apparently healthy people for early signs of coronary artery disease.|$|E
25|$|Bruce and Dr. Harold T. Dodge {{initiated}} the Seattle Heart Watch program in 1971. This program involved community physicians in hospitals, offices, {{and the medical}} department of the Boeing Company. It tested the feasibility, utility and reproducibility of results of symptom-limited <b>exercise</b> <b>testing</b> in ambulatory cardiac patients and apparently healthy subjects. A database of more than 10,000 individuals was developed over the next 10 years. Signals from the treadmill monitors were sent by dataphone from 15 different test sites to the University Hospital research lab for analysis, and follow-up questionnaires from thousands of patients were accumulated for years. This database was used to develop normal standards based on age, sex and habitual pattern of activity. The duration of exercise became the principal measurement for the estimation of what Bruce termed functional aerobic impairment.|$|E

Currently, predischarge low level and 6 -week symptom-limited <b>exercise</b> treadmill <b>tests</b> are recommended for risk stratification after myocardial infarction. However, few data exist on the safety and value of a predischarge symptom-limited <b>exercise</b> <b>test.</b> Methods. We utilized a modified Bruce protocol starting at 1. 7 mph and 0 grade with 3 -min stage in 150 consecutive patients 6. 4 ± 3. 1 days after myocardial infraction. Each <b>exercise</b> <b>test</b> was interpreted for duration, symptom and ST segment changes at the low level (70 % of predicted heart rate) and symptom-limited end point. Results. There were no complications related to the symptom-limited <b>exercise</b> <b>test.</b> The test results were positive in only 23 % of the patients at the low level end point, but were positive in 40 % of the patients at the later symptom-limited end point (p < 0. 001).

The performance characteristics during an <b>exercise</b> <b>test</b> 6 months after myocardial infarction were related to the development of death, recurrent nonfatal myocardial infarction and coronary artery bypass surgery in the subsequent 12 months (that is, 6 to 18 months after infarction) in 473 patients. Mortality was significantly greater in patients who exhibited any of the following: inability to perform the <b>exercise</b> <b>test</b> because of cardiac limitations, the development of ST segment elevation of 1 mm or greater during the <b>exercise</b> <b>test,</b> an inadequate blood pressure response during exercise, the development of any ventricular premature depolarizations during exercise or the recovery period and inability to exercise beyond stage I of the modified Bruce protocol.

The primary aim {{of the present study}} was to determine whether a graded 1 -legged peak <b>exercise</b> <b>test</b> is feasible and provides a valid assessment of peak aerobic capacity in older people walking with a lower-limb prosthesis. Design. This was a quasi-experimental case-control study. Methods. A total of 36 older people with a lower-limb prosthesis and 21 people who were able-bodied (controls) (overall mean age= 61. 7 years, SD= 6. 1) performed a discontinuous graded 1 -legged <b>exercise</b> <b>test.</b> The peak respiratory exchange ratio was used as an indicator of maximal effort. The controls performed an additional 2 -legged <b>exercise</b> <b>test</b> to provide insight into differences between the testing modes. Results. All participants were able to perform the <b>exercise</b> <b>test.</b> Electrocardiographic tracings and blood pressure were adequately monitored. The controls and the people with a lower-limb amputation were able to stress the cardiovascular system to a similar extent. Analyses of construct validity revealed that the peak aerobic capacity measured with the 1 -legged <b>exercise</b> <b>test</b> was able to distinguish between participants on the basis of age, body mass index, and sex to a similar extent as the conventional 2 -legged <b>exercise</b> <b>test.</b> Limitations.

50|$|A very {{important}} method for assessing prognosis in advanced heart failure patients is cardiopulmonary <b>exercise</b> <b>testing</b> (CPX testing).
