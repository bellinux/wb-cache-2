Only a few acres (< 200) of bunch grapes, Euvitis spp., are grown in Florida. In general, grapes are susceptible to many insect pests.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from April 1, 2016 - April 1, 2018 Entomopathogenic fungi are cosmopolitan microbial pathogens that cause fungous diseases {{in a wide range}} of insects via spore infection. Due to their natural enemy status, they have tremendous potential for use as microbial control agents against insect pests, especially subterranean pests for which few management options are available. The clover <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> (Hylastinus obscurus Marsham) develops belowground, attacks the roots of red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) and causes a drastic reduction in seed yield. Hylastinus obscurus was controlled with organochlorine pesticides but their use was prohibited due to hazardous effects on the environment, and non-target organisms including humans. Subsequently, no alternative pest management strategy was developed for this pest. Meanwhile, little is known about impacts of entomopathogenic fungi on clover <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> The current study was conducted to isolate naturally occuring entomopathogenic fungi and assess their pathogenicity against the clover <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> More than 150 isolates were collected from infected clover <b>root</b> <b>borers</b> and <b>root</b> zone soil samples from five red clover seed production fields in western Oregon. Based on morphologic characters and phylogenetic analyses using ITS sequence data, these belonged to six species - Beauveria bassiana, B. pseudobassiana, Metarhizium brunneum, Isaria fumosorosea, I. farinosa and Lecanicillium muscarium. A laboratory experiment showed that two species of field isolated fungi - B. bassiana and I. fumosorosea were as effective in killing clover <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> adults as commercial sources of M. brunneum and I. fumosorosea when exposed to these fungi in petri dishes with sterile white sand. Subsequently, H. obscurus adults were exposed to four spore concentrations of B. bassiana and M. brunneum separately in cups filled with field collected unsterilized and sterilized soil. There were no significant mortality differences on either sterilized and unsterilized soil. However, at the highest concentration, more than 80 % of clover <b>root</b> <b>borers</b> died with M. brunneum while with B. bassiana, the mortality was not significantly different due to high mortality in the negative control. Based on the study, at least six species of entomopathogenic fungi occur naturally in red clover seed production fields in western Oregon, and field isolated fungi are as virulent as commercial fungi against the clover <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> Further research is needed for evaluation of the pathogenicity of these entomopathogenic fungi under field conditions...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} Cosmopolites sordidus (Coleoptera: Dryophthoridae) infestation among different banana genotypes {{in a commercial}} banana orchard {{over the course of}} 30 months. Banana <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> infestation was compared in 20 banana genotypes, including five varieties and 15 hybrids. Overall, we observed that 94. 17 % of pest infestation cases occurred in the cortex region, and only 5. 83 % occurred in the central cylinder. Genotypes least sensitive to infestation were the Prata Anã (AAB) and Pacovan (AAB) varieties, where no damage was recorded. Among the hybrid genotypes, PV 9401 and BRS Fhia 18 showed intermediate levels of sensitivity, while BRS Tropical hybrids (AAAB), PA 9401 (AAAB), BRS Vitoria (AAAB), YB 4203 (AAAB), and Bucaneiro (AAAA) were the most sensitive to attack by banana <b>root</b> <b>borer.</b> This study demonstrated that the infestation of the banana <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> varies according banana plant genotype, and the utilization of less susceptible genotypes could reduce infestation rates of C. sordidus...|$|R

40|$|Red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) is a {{valuable}} forage legume grown alone or in mixture with grasses in temperate regions of the world. Red clover is adapted {{to a wide range}} of soil types, pH levels, environmental and management conditions. However, the main limitation of this species is the lack of persistence related to the high mortality of plants. In Chile the main biotic factor affecting survival of plants is the <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> Hylastinus obscurus (Marsham) (Coleóptera; Scolytidae). In 1989, a red clover (T. pratense L.) breeding program was started at Carillanca Research Center of the Institute of Agricultural Research (INIA), Chile, with the main objectives of improving the survival of plants, forage yield and persistence. In 2002 a research line to study the interaction between the <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> and the plant was started. This paper describes briefly the improvement obtained in survival of young plants after twenty years of breeding and the importance of <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> population regarding forage yield. Experiments were conducted at Carillanca Research Center under irrigated conditions, comparing under cutting the dry matter yield of new synthetic lines and Redqueli-INIA with Quinequeli-INIA. The experimental lines Syn Int IV, Syn Pre III, Syn Int V and Syn Int VI were more productive than the cultivars Redqueli-INIA and Quiñequeli-INIA at the second season. The evaluation of the biological parameter allowed identifying a tolerant line, Syn Pre I, and three potential new varieties: Syn Pre III, Syn Int V and Syn Int VI. This is the first report showing an inverse relation between dry matter yield of red clover and <b>root</b> <b>borer</b> population (P< 0. 05).

One, two, three and six phosphine tablets of three gram each, per plant were tested. In the August essay, phosphine was inefficient to control the borer. In the October essay, control was achieved using as little as 2 tablets per plant and in November with one tablet per plant to control the adult borers in the soil.

They differ some in biology and life history, but they are addressed here as a group because their general activities as a pest class are similar. Taken in order of importance and frequency as a pest, they are the roundheaded appletree borer, flatheaded appletree <b>borer,</b> broad necked <b>root</b> <b>borer,</b> and tilehorned prionus. With {{the exception of the}} flattheaded appletree borer, which is a buprestid (metallic woodboring beetle), they belong to the cerambycid (long-horned beetle) family, and the last two are closely related species in the group known as prionus <b>root</b> <b>borers.</b> All are native to and widely distributed throughout the United States and southern Canada. They all damage deciduous fruit and shade trees by tunneling as larvae in to the conducting tissue of the lower trunk, crown, and roots and compounding the injury by providing an entryway for destructive fungi. Each of these pests attacks a broad range of host plants. All four species attack apple, cherry, peach, and plum, and the roundheaded and flatheaded borers also occur in quince, pear, flowering crabapple, mountain ash, shadbush, cotoneaster, and hawthorn.
