40|$|This thesis has {{characterized}} the applicability and limitation of PDMS micromolding and the substrate bonding techniques including both anodic (Si-glass) and thermal fusion (<b>glass-glass)</b> <b>bonding,</b> in fabricating sub- 100 -nm thick nanofluidic channels, {{which will be}} used for a controlled experimental study of molecular and fluidic transport in confined space. It is found that the fabrication of nanofluidic channels using PDMS substrate is generally limited to the thickness of - 100 nm because of the softness of the materials. Also, the gas permeability of PDMS poses a significant challenge in the operation of the nanofluidic devices. We demonstrate that nanofluidic channels, as thin as 20 nm with high aspect ratio (more than 250 : 1, width to depth) on silicon substrate and 25 nm with aspect ratio of 2000 on glass substrate can be achieved with anodic bonding technique and direct <b>glass-glass</b> <b>bonding</b> technique, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) measurement is used to prove that the channels are of good uniformity and there is no significant change of the depth of nanofluidic channels due to anodic bonding process and <b>glass-glass</b> <b>bonding</b> process. (cont.) In addition, we have demonstrated massively-parallel vertical nanofluidic filters, with fluidic conductance as large as standard microfluidic channels, by using a combination of deep reactive ion etching (DRIE) and anisotropic KOH etching followed by an oxidation step. The lateral nanofilter array device achieved separation of the mixture of X-DNA and Hind III digest of lambda DNA in half an hour by the mechanism of entropic trapping. The fabrication strategy for the nanofilter array device can be further optimized to achieve the uniform gap. These devices could be a key to the high-throughput nanofluidic sample-preparation microsystems. by Pan Mao. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|Develop an efficient, {{reliable}} fusion bonding {{recipe for}} the glass-glass structured devices with patterned nanochannels (at 50 nm in depth). Investigate {{the effect of}} experimental parameters (temperature and pressure) behind the <b>glass-glass</b> <b>bonding</b> process. Background Information Glass is a desired material in micro- and nanoscale device fabrication due to its optical clarity, chemical inertness and temperature stability. One {{of the most important}} applications for micro-and nanodevices is Lab-on-a-Chip(LOC) devices. Fusion (direct) bonding is the best approach to generate an enclosed channel with 4 chemically similar walls. Channel collapse/disfiguration are some challenges associated with fusion bonding...|$|E
40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} laser-assisted bonding methods for assembly of microfluidic devices and MEMS packaging. A laser microwelding technique for assembly of transparent polymer substrates for fabrication of microfluidic devices was studied. The transparent PMMA substrates were bonded together using a high power diode laser system with a broad top-hat beam profile and an intermediate titanium thin film consisting of 0. 7 mm diameter spots. A tensile strength of 6 MPa was achieved for this novel method which is {{comparable to that of}} the previous work in laser welding of polymers. It has been demonstrated that the method is capable of leak free encapsulation of a microfluidic channel. Furthermore, a novel laser-based method using an LCP film for packaging of MEMS, sensors and other microelectronic devices has been investigated. The results show {{that it is possible to}} use a laser based method with an LCP polymer for high quality substrate bonding applications. Glass-glass based cavities allow optical transmission and have potential applications for optical sensors and other photonic devices. For <b>glass-glass</b> <b>bonding,</b> it was shown that thin film titanium material can be used as an effective optical absorber in the laser based LCP bonding technique. Laser bonding of glass and silicon using an LCP film has also been achieved but in this case the silicon substrate acted as the absorber to capture the laser power. Laser bonding of a silicon cap to a molded LCP package has also been demonstrated successfully. The results of temperature monitoring using embedded sensors show that the temperature at the base of the LCP package (~ 130 C) is substantially lower than the bonding temperature (> 280 C). The results of shear and leak test show good reliability and hermeticity of the laser bonded microcavities. Both two-dimensional and three-dimensional models of heat transfer are developed and studied using the COMSOL Multiphysics software tool to understand the localised laser heating effects. The results are in good agreement with those of the practical work...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} a novel room-temperature bonding {{technique}} based on chemically activated Fluorinated Ethylene Propylene (FEP) sheet {{as an intermediate}} between chemically activated substrates is presented. Surfaces of silicon and glass substrates are chemically modified with APTES bearing amine terminal groups, while FEP sheet surfaces are treated to form carboxyl groups and subsequently activated by means of EDC-NHS chemistry. The activation procedures of silicon, glass and FEP sheet are characterized by contact angle measurements and XPS. Robust bonds are created at room-temperature by simply pressing two amine-terminated substrates together with activated FEP sheet in between. Average tensile strengths of 5. 9 MPa and 5. 2 MPa are achieved for silicon-silicon and <b>glass-glass</b> <b>bonds,</b> respectively, and the average fluidic pressure that can be operated is 10. 2 bar. Moreover, it is demonstrated that FEP-bonded microfluidic chips can handle mild organic solvents at elevated pressures without leakage problems. This versatile room-temperature intermediate layer bonding technique has a high potential for bonding, packaging, and assembly of various (bio-) chemical microfluidic systems and MEMS device...|$|R
40|$|<b>Glass-glass</b> direct <b>bonding</b> {{is closely}} rated to proven {{processes}} in Si-Si wafer bonding. We describe plasma-assisted hydrophilic direct bonding of different glass materials for various applications in optical and high precision engineering. Dedicated “zero-expansion” glass {{has been used}} in constructive type “sandwich” bonding of stiff platforms and mirrors as required in space or lithography applications. For transmissive optical applications in the visual and near infra-red spectral range, fused silica is the material of choice and the technology of direct bonding allows to join optical surfaces without an interlayer in a perfectly materials adapted manner. Binary gratings were fabricated and successfully encapsulated in this way for pulse shaping in high power laser devices. The corresponding activities at Fraunhofer IOF are presented and results of supportive laser damage and transmission efficiency measurements for optical characterization are outlined...|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo dry {{subtractive}} {{techniques for}} the fabrication of microchannels in borosilicate glass were investigated, plasma etching and laser ablation. Inductively coupled plasma {{reactive ion etching}} {{was carried out in}} a fluorine plasma (C 4 F 8 /O 2) using an electroplated Ni mask. Depth up to 100 μm with a profile angle of 83 °- 88 ° and a smooth bottom of the etched structure (Ra below 3 nm) were achieved at an etch rate of 0. 9 μm/min. An ultrashort pulse Ti:sapphire laser operating at the wavelength of 800 nm and 5 kHz repetition rate was used for micromachining. Channels of 100 μm width and 140 μm height with a profile angle of 80 - 85 ° were obtained in 3 min using an average power of 160 mW and a pulse duration of 120 fs. A novel process for <b>glass-glass</b> anodic <b>bonding</b> using a conductive interlayer of Si/Al/Si has been developed to seal microfluidic components with good optical transparency using a relatively low temperature (350 °C) ...|$|R
