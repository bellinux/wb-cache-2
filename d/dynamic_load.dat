40|$|AbstractBased on Biot’s fully dynamic poroelastic theory, {{the dynamic}} {{responses}} of the poroelastic half-space soil medium due to quasi-static and <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> from a moving train are investigated semi-analytically. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> {{are assumed to be}} generated from the rail surface irregularities. The vehicle dynamics model is used to simulate the axle loads (quasi-static <b>loads)</b> and the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> from a moving train. The compatibility of the displacements at wheel–rail contact points couple the vehicle and the track–ground subsystem, and yield equations for the <b>dynamic</b> wheel–rail <b>loads.</b> A linearized Hertzian contact spring between the wheel and rail is introduced to calculate the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads.</b> Using the Fourier transform, the governing equations for the poroelastic half-space are then solved in the frequency–wavenumber domain. The time domain responses are evaluated by the fast inverse Fourier transform. Numerical results show that the <b>dynamic</b> <b>loads</b> can make important contribution to dynamic response of the poroelastic half-space for different train speed, and the dynamically induced responses lie in a higher frequency range. The ground vibrations caused by the moving train can be intensified as the primary suspension stiffness of the vehicle increases...|$|R
