40|$|Two novel heterocyclic third components, <b>hexahydropyridine</b> (HHP) and 1 -ethylpiperidine (EP) were firstly {{found to}} enhance room {{temperature}} phosphorescence (RTP) of alpha-bromonaphthalene (ot-BrN) induced by cyclodextrin. The effects of equilibrium time for formation of inclusion complex, temperature, pH {{values and the}} variation of concentrations of each component on RTP of alpha-BrN and the RTP lifetime of each ternary complex had been investigated and compared to discuss inclusion mechanism of ternary complexes. The RTP lifetimes of alpha-BrN/beta-CD[HHP, alpha-BrN/beta-CD/cyclohexane (CH) and alpha-BrN/beta-CD/EP were 6. 18, 7. 71 and 9. 36 ms, respectively. Based on the strongest RTP of a-BrN induced by CD {{in the presence of}} EP, a method for determination of EP was established. Under the optimal conditions, the analytical curve of EP gave a liner dynamic range of 1. 50 x 10 (- 4) to 1. 50 x 10 (- 3) mol L- 1 with a detection limit of 4. 8 x 10 (- 5) mol L- 1. When the established CD-RTP method was applied to determine the concentration of EP synthetic samples in distilled water, the experimental results demonstrated that the recovery was 91. 4 % with a relative standard deviation less than 2. 85 % (n = 7).
