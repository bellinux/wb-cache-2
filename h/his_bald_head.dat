He currently competes part-time in the NASCAR Xfinity Series, driving the No. 07 Chevrolet Camaro for SS-Green Light Racing.|$|E
25|$|Many Conservative {{politicians}} of generations following Macleod recalled {{him as a}} highly effective speaker. <b>His</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> and piercing gaze gave him a striking physical presence, {{and he was one}} of the most powerful platform speakers of his generation, in the league of Churchill or Aneurin Bevan. He was also a superb negotiator with a grasp of detail. Never one to suffer fools, by middle age his disability made him very short-tempered and impatient with people.|$|E
25|$|In 458 BC, he {{returned}} to Sicily for the last time, visiting the city of Gela where he died in 456 or 455BC. Valerius Maximus wrote that he was killed outside the city by a tortoise dropped by an eagle which had mistaken <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> for a rock suitable for shattering the shell of the reptile. Pliny, in his Naturalis Historiæ, adds that Aeschylus had been staying outdoors to avoid a prophecy {{that he would be}} killed by a falling object. But this story may be legendary and due to a misunderstanding of the iconography on Aeschylus's tomb. Aeschylus's work was so respected by the Athenians that after his death, his were the only tragedies allowed to be restaged in subsequent competitions. His sons Euphorion and Euæon and his nephew Philocles also became playwrights.|$|E

25|$|Kenzo Suzuki only {{wrestled}} {{one more}} match for CMLL after losing his hair, showing off <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> {{two weeks later}} on the December 29, 2006 Super Viernes where he teamed with El Terrible and Pierroth Jr. as the team lost to Dos Caras Jr., Lizmark Jr. and Rey Bucanero. While Suzuki left the promotion Corleone would continue to work for CMLL for a while, turning tecnico later on, partially due to the positive response of the Arena Mexico crowd. Shocker and Universo 2000 did not team up after the Sin Piedad victory. Los Guerreros del Infierno would hold the CMLL World Trios Championship to the Los Perros del Mal team of Perro Aguayo Jr., Mr. Águila and Héctor Garza. The Hiroka/Dark Angel storyline was ended without a proper resolution as Hiroka lost the CMLL World Women's Championship to Lady Apache only 10 days after the event.|$|E
2500|$|Caterpillars {{have been}} used symbolically in media to symbolize characters' {{positioning}} at or reluctance to progress past {{an early stage of}} development (e.g., in the Mad Men season 3 episode, [...] "The Fog", in which Betty Draper has a drug-induced dream, while in labor, that she captures a caterpillar and holds it firmly in her hand) or in combination with butterflies to show their maturation (e.g., in The Sopranos season 5 episode, [...] "The Test Dream", in which Tony Soprano dreams that Ralph Cifaretto has a caterpillar on <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> that changes into a butterfly).|$|E
2500|$|Messier was {{featured}} in a Lay's chips campaign that aired in Canada in the late 1990s and early 2000s. The commercials originally featured Messier being challenged to a bet by a local hockey fan, who bets that Messier cannot eat just one potato chip, {{in reference to the}} Lay's slogan [...] "bet you can't eat just one." [...] Messier loses the bet, and ends up playing in a local [...] "beer league" [...] hockey game (for a team called [...] "The Pylons"), which he easily dominates. Later variations would have Messier himself making the same bet. He was also featured in Lay's ads in the U.S. where he asked neighbors to borrow ice, sugar or a hairdryer (playing on <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head)</b> to get chips.|$|E

2500|$|Simplitas/Smith's Arcadian {{restaurant}} {{has become the}} rage of London, as the menu {{is that of the}} simple life. Simplitas, however, is not living and spreading the simple life as his Arcadian friends had hoped, but rather is having [...] "the time of his life." [...] Mrs. Smith becomes suspicious of Simplicitas, and in endeavouring to explain the reason for an all-night absence, he tells another lie. He falls into the ornamental well in the restaurant and emerges as his former self, with <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> and shaggy whiskers, to the astonishment and somewhat to the confusion of his wife. Sombra and Chrysea, realising that their mission to make all London tell the truth has failed, return to Arcadia – but they leave two happy couples behind.|$|E
2500|$|Hayes {{was back}} in 1973 with an {{acclaimed}} live double album, Live at the Sahara Tahoe, and followed {{it up with the}} album Joy, with the eerie beat of the 15-minute title track. He moved away from cover songs with this album. An edited [...] "Joy" [...] would be a hit single. In 1974, Hayes was featured in the blaxploitation films Three Tough Guys and Truck Turner, and he recorded soundtracks for both. Tough Guys was almost devoid of vocals and Truck Turner yielded a single with the title theme. The soundtrack score of Truck Turner was eventually used by filmmaker Quentin Tarantino in the Kill Bill film series, and has been used for over 30 years as the opening score of Brazilian radio show Jornal de Esportes on the Jovem Pan station. Unlike most African-American musicians of the period, Hayes did not sport an Afro; <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head</b> became one of his defining characteristics.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the title}} loss, he {{attacked}} The Miz with a knockout punch and hugged Teddy Long, turning {{face for the}} first time since 2008. Later on in the night as part of the 2010 WWE draft, Big Show was drafted back to the SmackDown brand. He returned to the brand on the April 30 episode of SmackDown and was subsequently named the number one contender for the World Heavyweight Championship, later on in the night he interrupted World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger as he was giving his [...] "State of Championship Address" [...] and knocked him out with a WMD. On the May 7 episode of SmackDown, Big Show sat ringside during the Swagger/Kane main event. After Swagger was disqualified, Show chokeslammed him through the announce table. He also crashed Swagger's achievement celebration and cost him his match with Kofi Kingston in the next week. Big Show defeated Jack Swagger via disqualification at Over The Limit. On the May 27 episode of Smackdown, General Manager Thedore Long scheduled qualifying matches for the World Heavyweight Championship match at Fatal 4-Way and that Big Show had already qualified by defeating Jack Swagger via disqualification at Over the Limit. At Fatal 4-Way, Show faced Rey Mysterio, CM Punk and Swagger for the World Heavyweight Championship, but Mysterio won the title. The following night, Swagger debuted his new finishing move, The Ankle Lock, and applied it on Big Show, thus injuring his ankle and continuing their feud. Two weeks later on Smackdown, Big Show saved Rey Mysterio, whose ankle was injured by the same move, from Swagger. Later that night, Big Show fought Swagger to a double count-out. Soon he began a feud with CM Punk and his Straight Edge Society, confronting him the Friday night before the Money in the Bank event, and unmasking him to reveal <b>his</b> <b>bald</b> <b>head.</b> After failing to win the ladder match for the Money in the Bank contract, he fought the mysterious masked member of the SES, also unmasking him as Joey Mercury. Show's feud with the Straight Edge Society continued after he defeated them in a 3 on 1 Handicap match at SummerSlam and CM Punk at Night of Champions. Big Show was made Team SmackDown's captain for Bragging Rights on the October 8 episode of SmackDown. At the event, Big Show was counted out with Sheamus during the match but his team ultimately won with Edge and Rey Mysterio left on the team. He was on Rey Mysterio's team for Survivor Series where he was a survivor along with Mysterio. The following episode of SmackDown, he was unsuccessful in qualifying for King of the Ring as he was defeated by Alberto Del Rio by count-out thanks to interference by his personal ring announcer, Ricardo Rodriguez.|$|E

5000|$|The eponymous Chuck Rock is an overweight, square-jawed caveman {{characterized}} by loutish and lewd behaviour perhaps {{influenced by the}} lad culture of the 1990s.
