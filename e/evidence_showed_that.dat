5|$|Sesame Street {{has been}} used to test the {{attention}} span of infants and toddlers. In 2004, children from three months to two years were shown Sesame Street clips and a group of computer-generated black and white patterns. Their attention spans, as determined by the duration of time they looked at the stimuli, significantly increased at six to twenty-four months, but only for the Sesame Street material. A study conducted in 2006 found that infants' attention span increased more when they were presented with video clips than with still images of the same stimuli, supporting the idea that movement helps young infants gain more information from the world around them. The <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> attention span depended both on age and the on the type of stimuli children viewed. The time they looked at stimuli decreased for all types of stimuli from fourteen to twenty-six weeks, but the time they looked at it increased depending on the stimuli. When older infants (age fourteen weeks to twelve months) looked at Sesame Street materials and human faces, their attention increased compared to other types of stimuli.|$|E

25|$|In 2002, Lydia Fairchild {{was denied}} public {{assistance}} in Washington state when DNA <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> {{she was not}} related to her children. A lawyer for the prosecution heard of a human chimera in New England, Karen Keegan, and suggested the possibility to the defense, who were able to show that Fairchild, too, was a chimera with two sets of DNA, and that one of those sets could have been the mother of the children.|$|E

Glucocorticoids induce a potent diuresis in heart failure because they could improve renal responsiveness to atrial natriuretic peptide by upregulating natriuretic peptide receptor A NPR-A expression in the renal inner medullary collecting duct, inducing a potent diuresis.|$|E

25|$|Roger Touhy {{and three}} of his top aides went on trial for the John Factor {{kidnapping}} on January 15, 1934.

At least one juror refused to report for duty midway through the trial, while another juror admitted he had perjured himself during voir dire. A mistrial was declared on February 2.|$|E
25|$|Cuvier’s fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> very {{different}} life forms {{existed in the}} past than those that exist today, a fact that was accepted by most scientists. The primary debate focused whether this turnover caused by extinction was gradual or abrupt in nature. Cuvier understood extinction {{to be the result}} of cataclysmic events that wipe out huge numbers of species, as opposed to the gradual decline of a species over time. His catastrophic view of the nature of extinction garnered him many opponents in the newly emerging school of uniformitarianism.|$|E
25|$|In October 2007, Michigan State University {{forensic}} scientist David Foran claimed that mitochondrial DNA <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the remains found beneath the cellar floor in Crippen's home were {{not those of}} Cora Crippen. This research was based on genealogical identification of three matrilineal relatives of Cora Crippen (great-nieces, located by U.S. genealogist Beth Wills), whose mitochondrial DNA haplotype was compared with DNA extracted from a slide with flesh taken from the torso in Crippen's cellar. This has raised new questions about {{the identity of the}} remains found in the cellar, and – by extension – over Crippen's guilt.|$|E

25|$|At {{one time}} it was {{believed}} that Blaufränkisch was a clone of the Gamay grape of Beaujolais, {{due in part to the}} prevalence of the synonym Gamé used in Bulgaria, and perhaps because it was thought that there was a parent-offspring relationship between the two. However, in the 21st century DNA <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Blaufränkisch was an offspring of Gouais blanc and an unknown parent, making it a half-sibling to Gamay as well as other varieties of grapes which have Gouais blanc as a parent such as Chardonnay, Riesling, Elbling, Aramon noir, Grolleau noir, Muscadelle and Colombard.|$|E
25|$|Police raided a {{house at}} Dhok Awan, Model Town Humak where the militants had stayed, and arrested the owner, Azam Qazi, {{as well as}} the {{property}} dealer who rented the house to the attackers. Several sets of Pakistani Army uniforms, maps of sensitive locations, fuses and detonators used in explosives, material used in making suicide jackets, and several identity cards were found at the safe house. Two pairs of trousers, two jeans, and over 10 pairs of Shalwar Kameez and slippers were also found. <b>Evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> at least 10 people were present at the house before the attack. The rent agreement was also found, which said the house was rented for Rs. 10,000 on 9 September. The attackers apparently stayed there for 20 to 25 days.|$|E
25|$|The foreign {{invasion}} theory {{does not}} {{answer the question of}} where the inhabitants went. David Webster believed that the population should have increased {{because of the lack of}} elite power. Further, it is not understood why the governmental institutions were not remade following the revolts, which happened under similar circumstances in places like China. A study by anthropologist Elliot M. Abrams came to the conclusion that buildings, specifically in Copan, did not require an extensive amount of time and workers to construct. However, this theory was developed during a period when the archaeological <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> there were fewer Maya people than there are now known to have been. Revolutions, peasant revolts, and social turmoil change circumstances, and are often followed by foreign wars, but they run their course. There are no documented revolutions that caused wholesale abandonment of entire regions.|$|E

25|$|According to some studies, {{the volume}} {{difference}} of SDN {{between males and}} females is related to apoptosis during early development after birth. In rats, central division of the medial preoptic nucleus (MPNc) is an important component of SDN-POA and <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the number of apoptotic cells within MPNc is greater in females than in males between postnatal day (PD) 7 and PD10. In MPNc, the levels of some proteins, which are related to apoptosis, were shown to be of significant difference {{between males and females}}. Such proteins include Bcl-2 and Bax. Bcl-2 is an antiapoptotic protein. The level of Bcl-2 in PD8 male rats is much higher than that in female rats of the same age, hence the number of apoptotic cells of MPNc in PD8 male rats is much lower than PD8 female rats. On the other hand, Bax, a proapoptotic protein, shows lower level in PD8 males than in PD8 females. Also, the number of active caspase-3-ir cells was observed to be greater in females than in males, indicating higher level of apoptosis in female MPNc.|$|E
25|$|During construction, 2,000 fossils were discovered, {{including}} 64 {{extinct species}} of fish, the tusk of an Ice Age elephant and {{the bones of}} an ancient longhorn bison, a report funded by the MTA found. The report was authored by paleontologist Bruce Lander of Paleo Environmental Associates in Irvine. Lander worked {{with a team of}} 28 scientists during construction of the Metro Rail Red Line. Fossil <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> {{tens of thousands of years}} ago, ground sloths, horses, elephants and camels roamed among redwood trees in what is now Los Angeles, according to an MTA summary of the 300-page report. The scientists also found evidence of a great flood in the San Fernando Valley 9,000 years ago that swept away trees. Among the 64 extinct species of marine fish 39 had never before been discovered, the report said. The scientists found bones of an American mastodon, a western camel and a Harlan's ground sloth. They found wood and pollen of land plants including incense cedar and coast redwood trees, and bones of birds, shrews, cottontail rabbits, gophers, mice and kangaroo rats. Some of the fossils are as much as 16.5 million years old.|$|E
25|$|A {{good example}} of a case where {{forensic}} entomology was successful in determining a postmortem interval is one involving a young prostitute and a thirty-year-old member of the Army. A family member had informed the police of her disappearance four days before her body was found. She had last {{been seen in the}} presence of this military man on May 31. A large number of adult flies and maggots were noticed and gathered inside and near the wounds of the young girl. A number of these maggots were kept and grown to be adult flies (reared), and others were taken in their present state. Pictures were taken and enlarged showing the flies around the body when it was found. Using this evidence along with correlating weather conditions known to be present around that time, an entomologist was able to give a postmortem interval. The <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the flies had arrived on May 31, which indicated a time period of four days since she had died. This information showed the army man to be the last person to be with the girl. When presented with the evidence authorities were able to get a confession out of the man. The use of forensic entomology was definitely a key factor in this case.|$|E

25|$|By November 1951, Wilkins had {{evidence}} that DNA in cells {{as well as}} purified DNA had a helical structure. Alex Stokes had solved the basic mathematics of helical diffraction theory and thought that Wilkins's X-ray diffraction data indicated a helical structure in DNA. Wilkins met with Watson and Crick and told them about his results. This information from Wilkins, along with additional information gained by Watson when he heard Franklin talk about her research during a King's College research meeting, stimulated Watson and Crick to create their first molecular model of DNA, a model with the phosphate backbones at the center. Upon viewing {{the model of the}} proposed structure, Franklin told Watson and Crick that it was wrong. Franklin based this on two observations. First, experiments by J.M. Gulland showed that the CO- and NH2 groups of the bases could not be titrated, and so were probably inaccessible. Secondly, crystallographic <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> the structural units of DNA were progressively separated by the addition of water, leading to the formation of a gel and then a solution. Franklin believed that the simplest explanation of this was for the hydrophilic part of the molecule to be on the outside. Crick tried to get Wilkins to continue with additional molecular modeling efforts, but Wilkins did not take this approach.|$|E
500|$|According to U.S. border surveillance, a white Mercury Grand Marquis with Mexican {{license plates}} 821-THE7 crossed at Brownsville border entry at 6:39p.m. CT on March 2. This car had crossed to Brownsville from Matamoros {{eighteen}} times between August 1992 and March 1993. When police {{went to the}} motel to check the register, they discovered that at 8:26p.m. CT that evening, Puentes Pizaña and Ramón Palomares, another hitman of the Cuellar organization, checked in with the receptionist. She registered the car in her notebook as a white Grand Marquis, but it was unclear if she wrote 821-WEX or 821-THE7 as the license plate number. Other <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> several calls were made from Puentes Pizaña's and Garza's rooms to an identical Dallas number {{on the day of}} the murder. The police were never able to connect the number with the investigation, or identify the Dallas contact. Other <b>evidence</b> <b>showed</b> <b>that</b> Garza, along with Cuellar and Moya, visited a gun shop in Dallas to purchase a [...]38 Super pistol.
