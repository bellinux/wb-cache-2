40|$|ABSTRACT- Utilization rate is an {{important}} factor in calculating machine rates for forest harvesting machines. Machine rates allow an evaluation of harvesting system costs and facilitate comparisons between different systems and machines. There are many factors that affect utilization rate. These include mechanical delays, non-mechanical delays, operational lost time, and personnel time. As a result utilization rate can be highly variable and difficult to accurately estimate without detailed information.

The crack opening stress model was implemented in a fatigue notch model and the fatigue lives of notched annealed 1045 steel specimens under the three different spectra scaled to several maximum stress levels were estimated.

40|$|At least 200, 000 m 3 {{of timber}} are {{harvested}} annually using semi-mechanised harvesting systems (SMS) on the Viphya forest plantations in Malawi. Although these systems {{have long been}} used on the Viphya, no investigation on their productivity {{has so far been}} reported. The absence of local productivity models created uncertainty about the importance of sitebased factors that influence timber harvesting productivity of these systems on the Viphya. Secondly, there is paucity of information regarding the appropriate timber harvesting systems for production maximisation and cost minimisation. This study aimed to develop prediction models for estimating the productivity and costs of semi-mechanised and simulated mechanised timber harvesting systems on the Viphya forest plantations. The study was conducted in Pinus kesiya stands at Kalungulu and Champhoyo forest stations of the Viphya forest plantations. A work study approach was followed to capture harvesting time and volume data. Stepwise multiple regressions were used to develop felling time models for a chainsaw over tree size, inter-tree distance, slope, ground condition, brush density, and ground roughness; and skidding time models over distance, slope, ground condition, ground roughness and volume skidded per cycle for a <b>grapple</b> <b>skidder.</b> Models were statistically validated. Secondary work study data for semi-mechanised systems were simulated for mechanised productivity based on local site factors. The study had shown that diameter at breast height and inter-tree distance were important factors that best explained felling time prediction models in Pinus kesiya stands on the Viphya forest plantations. Similarly, distance from stump to the roadside landing was {{the most important factor in}} addition to volume load, slope and ground conditions that determined grapple skidding time. Mechanised systems appear to be more advantageous than semi-mechanised systems. The former are associated with lower operating costs and inventories with relatively high production rates. Therefore, mechanised systems could help to optimise timber harvesting productivity on the Viphya. Further studies should be conducted to determine the effect of different ground conditions and roughness on skidding productivity. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2013.

40|$|Title from PDF {{of title}} page; {{abstract}} from research PDF (University of Missouri [...] Columbia, viewed on June 20, 2014). Woody biomass materials which include timber harvest residues, such as tree tops and small diameter trees, {{have the potential}} to be an important source of renewable energy. Their use as an energy feedstock or use as an input for other products is partly dependent on whether the materials can be harvested and transported to markets in a cost-efficient manner. In order to supplement the current knowledge base on woody biomass harvest systems, two integrated harvest systems, a whole tree harvest that extracted tops and a whole tree harvest that extracted tops and small diameter trees, simultaneously harvested woody biomass and conventional solid hardwood products (SHWP) on 30 acres of Missouri forestland. A mechanized system consisting of a feller-buncher, <b>grapple</b> <b>skidder,</b> and loader was used in both harvesting systems. Activity sampling and time-in-motion data were collected on all harvest machinery to determine system efficiency. Joint cost analysis was used to separate costs associated with harvesting SHWP and woody biomass. Marginal cost analysis was used to treat the tops of SHWP that were brought whole tree to the landing as a by-product of the SHWP. A sensitivity analysis was used to test the effects of changes of different costs on the cost per green ton of SHWP and woody biomass. Total cost estimates per green ton of material delivered to the landing at a 5 % interest rate were $ 35. 25 for SHWP and $ 5. 76 for woody biomass in the whole tree (WT) harvest and $ 32. 82 for SHWP and $ 8. 81 for woody biomass in the whole tree with small diameter tree (WTSD) harvest.

40|$|During {{the last}} decades, {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in ground-based mechanized harvesting systems in the western United States as harvest of second growth increased. A major reason for that interest is that labor productivity using conventional methods decreases with smaller tree size. In Turkey, the application of mechanization is currently low due to low labor costs and high fuel costs. However, changing economic conditions might increase interest in mechanized harvesting systems in Turkey. To select the most profitable harvesting equipment under given operating conditions, the harvesting manager must know how to determine logging costs to evaluate alternative systems effectively. Analytical methods were used in this project to estimate machine cost and productivity for different harvesting system combinations. Animal logging was also considered because highly mechanized timber harvest systems are expensive, and energy consuming. Animals and farm tractors are the major energy sources for agricultural and forestry work and transportation in Turkey. A small amount of animal skidding also takes a place in forestry operations in the western United States to reduce environmental impact. Forty-two machines were selected from six categories of ground-based forest harvesting machines, including skidder, forwarder, harvester, feller-buncher, loader, and crawler tractor. Machine rates were estimated for selected forest harvesting machines under representative conditions in both western United States and in Turkey. Cable harvesting systems are described but not analyzed. A microcomputer spreadsheet program was developed to calculate machine rates. Harvesting operations from stump to truck were investigated {{to have a clear}} picture of harvesting operations including fellling and bucking, skidding, forwarding, yarding, and loading. Harvesting production and harvesting costs were determined depending on the types of equipment being operated. To estimate production rates for specific logging equipment, cycle time was obtained from the production equations as a dependent variable, and converted to production using log size, volume, or weight. Production equations are based on studies that have provided useful data to investigate productivity of the logging equipment under various harvesting conditions. Finally, the most economical machine combination, which minimizes the unit cost of logging, was investigated for three different regions of Turkey. The data including topographic data, road data, tree and log data, soil data, and cost data was collected from selected sample plots of each region as representative conditions. In the sample plots selected from Black Sea and Aegean regions, the cut-to-length system using four sawyers and a forwarder produced wood on the truck at the lowest cost, 11. 18 /rn 3, and 13. 88 /m 3, respectively. In the sarnple plots selected from Mediterranean region, the whole-tree systern using four sawyers, a <b>grapple</b> <b>skidder,</b> and a loader produced wood at the lowest cost (9. 20 /m 3).

40|$|On-board {{computing}} (OBC) {{systems in}} South African timber-harvesting operations are currently limited {{because of the}} lack of local expertise and experience. In this study three trials were conducted, monitoring three skidder extraction operations at three sites in South African softwood sawtimber operations. Both cable and <b>grapple</b> <b>skidders</b> were equipped with a MultiDAT data collection device. For all trials, parallel manual time studies were conducted. The results from the time-studies were then used as the basis for evaluation of the accuracy of the information gathered by the OBCs. The results demonstrated the usefulness of OBC devices. This paper reports the results of the application of various tools to support these assessments, considering different levels of complexity, different detail of the results and different fields of application (business uses and research purpose). With regards to the estimation of the machine utilisation rate, it was highlighted that the use of the vibration sensor with additional input from the machine operator in order to define the reason for stopping offered the best solution with an error ranging from − 0. 74 % to + 5. 54 %. This tool can be used in long-term monitoring to identify the possible under-utilisation of a machine and consequently to establish a working system that provides greater productivity. For the evaluation of machine utilisation, the simple analysis of the GPS track-log also provided good results with an error ranging from 4. 29 % to − 4. 25 %, but it required time-consuming post-operation processing of the raw data in order to correctly interpret. The use of GPS data to perform work studies in general worked reasonably well, the main problem being again that, at certain stages, the process was not easily automated and tended to require time-consuming post-operation data manipulation. However, because of the amount of information derived from data processing, it presents a useful research tool. The introduction of simple OBCs in South Africa is possible, but does require organisational changes and adaptations from both machine operators, who need to be trained to understand and manage the specific user interface and data transmission, and from management responsible for data storage, collation and analysis, and subsequently the implementation of results in improving forest operations...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2001 Although {{previous}} research in central Oregon has shown soil compaction {{can lead to}} a decline in site productivity, the subject is not understood well enough to predict the growth changes resulting from a given level of soil compaction. A study was initiated to relate the basal area, height and volume periodic annual increment (PAT) of residual, 70 to 80 year-old ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Laws.) trees to compacted soil conditions, as measured by soil strength. This study was superimposed on the USDA Forest Service Long Term Site Productivity Project research plots in Central Oregon and thus constrained by its design. Soil strength and tree growth were measured on six of these plots. Three plots had been thinned with a mechanical harvester and the stems removed with a <b>grapple</b> <b>skidder</b> from the plots (Complete Removal). Three other plots were thinned to similar stocking levels with the harvester, but the stems were left in place to minimize disturbance (No Removal). No true control existed for these installations as both the Complete Removal and No Removal plots were compacted by the harvester. A recording penetrometer was used to determine soil strength along systematically spaced grid points, to a depth of 24 inches. Each tree within each plot was mapped and measured for total height, diameter at breast height, and radial growth increment at diameter breast high (DBH). The soil conditions around each residual tree were evaluated using 15, 30 -, and 45 -foot radius plots. The penetrometer readings that fell within each of these plots were averaged to represent the overall soil conditions affecting each tree. The Complete Removal plots had significantly higher soil strength conditions than the No Removal plots (p< 0. 05). The percent increases in average soil strength of the Complete Removal plots over the No Removal plots were 39, 42 and 44 percent for the 15 -, 30 - and 45 -foot radius plots, respectively. Potential associations between basal area, height and cubic volume PAT growth rates and replication, treatment, soil strength and other covariates were explored with general linear models. Soil strength was not a significant factor for basal area PAT or for volume PAT at the 30 - and 45 -foot radius. Total height and cubic volume PAl at the 15 -foot radius declined significantly (p< 0. 05) with increasing soil strength. The volcanic ash soils did compact {{as a result of the}} low level of mechanical thinning activity conducted on the study sites. Tree growth was statistically associated with increased soil compaction. Lack of a true control prevents full evaluation of the mechanical harvesting-related compaction; however, skidding resulted in a measurable increase in soil compaction in the Complete Removal plots. Forest management practices that lead to frequent entries appear likely to compact these volcanic ash soils. Depending on logging patterns, large areas could be impacted without careful planning It appears that compaction effects are long-lasting and cumulative, thus the risk of reducing long-term site productivity is a concern...|$|E
40|$|The last decade, {{in forest}} {{harvesting}} {{more and more}} use is made of specialized machines, such as harvesters and forwarders. However, these machines, among other things time efficient and safer to work with, normally have a great weight of which {{the impact on the}} soil should not be underestimated. Therefore, increasingly more {{attention has been paid to}} the impact of mechanized harvesting on the forest ecosystem in general and the soil in particular. However, research often takes place under different circumstances of soil, machine type used, weather conditions, traffic intensity et cetera so that results are difficult to compare. In an integrated experiment (performed in Flandres, Belgium) the effect of soil texture, soil water content, machine weight and traffic intensity on the degree of soil compaction is being examined. Eight forest stands were chosen on four soil textures (sand, sandy loam, loam, alluvial clay), in each case performing the same experiment in winter (high soil water content, 19 - 20 February 2007) and in summer (low soil water content, August-September 2007). For selection, certain criteria were used: stands must be close to eachother (same weather conditions), no harvesting activities may be performed in the last 10 years and tree distance must be large enough so that no trees have to be felt to alow machines to pass. Two machines are used: a New Holland TCE 50 tractor, 1460 kg, weighted to 1880 kg and a John Deere 640 D <b>grapple</b> <b>skidder,</b> 11800 kg, weighted with a concrete block to 14300 kg. In each stand eight trails of 40 meters are marked out, four for the winter, respectively the summer experiment. Of these four trails, two trails are provided for each machine, one to drive one passage back and forth and one to drive five passages back and forth. Several soil physical variables are measured to quantify the degree of soil compaction. Reference measurements are made on the trails before the experiment. After passage of the machines, the same soil variables are measured on the trails within and between the wheel tracks. Soil samples are taken from depth intervals 0 - 10, 10 - 20 and 20 - 30 cm with Kopeckey soil cores. After weighing, the samples are dried (24 h, 105 °C) and weighed again in order to estimate bulk density and the soil water content. A subset of the samples remains undisturbed in the Kopeckey soil cores and are analysed for saturated hydraulic conductivity and the pF-curve. With a penetrologger, penetration resistance of the soil is measured to a depth of 80 cm. Through the process of soil compaction, pore volume and continuity are also influenced, what may alter gas diffusion rate. As this is a very sensitive indicator for soil compaction, in a later phase measurements of CO²-concentrations in the soil profile will be performed. Two poles and a 4 m long slat, placed across the width of the skid trail are used to examine the depth of the ruts. Each 10 cm a measurement is made of the penetration resistance and the vertical distance between soil and slat. In future, a trench will be dug across the width of the skid trails to evaluate the impression of the different soil layers. In each stand a part of each skid trail is marked and will be protected from perturbation at future harvesting activities. The aim is to monitor the soil physical properties in order to estimate the recovery rate and to examine the response of the biotic variables, such as fauna, flora, regeneration,…Results of the winter experiment are now (partially) available but still have to be processed...|$|E

Trees are felled with a feller-buncher, extracted to roadside landings with <b>grapple</b> or cable <b>skidders,</b> delimbed and processed into logs with a dangle-head processor on an excavator base. Logs are then sorted and stacked with a loading grapple on an excavator base, and loaded onto a truck with a truck mounted hydraulic crane. The size of the equipment used depends {{on the size of}} tree within the stands in which harvesting is taking place. Forestal Mininco classifies pine stands into four average tree size classes labelled A through D, with A having the biggest trees and D the smallest; over 0.9 m 3, 0.65 to 0.89 m 3, 0.4 to 0.64 m 3, and under 0.4 m 3. Waratah 620 processors working over Komatsu PC 200 excavators are typically used in Forest Classes C and D. Waratah 622 processors working over Komatsu PC 200 excavators or Waratah 622 B processors working over Komatsu PC 220 excavators are typically used in Forest Classes A and B. The forest class also determines the number of products (different diameter and lengths) cut, ranging from 8 to 10 for Forest Class A to 3 or 4 for Forest Class D.|$|R
40|$|The {{handbook}} {{does not}} attempt to define a single “best ” system for any site. Instead, it presumes that readers {{need to be aware}} of the key factors that influence the probability of achieving success with any given combination of equipment and site characteristics. Readers will then use their own judgement to evaluate the merits of the various options. The information in the handbook should be considered only as part of an overall process for equipment selection which will vary from company to company. To improve their productivity, loader-forwarders are used to great advantage with other machines such as <b>grapple</b> yarders and <b>skidders,</b> especially when working around sensitive zones. The loader-forwarders can travel close to the sensitive zones, extract the logs without encroaching on the protected areas, and place the logs in a more advantageous position for the primary equipment to reach. This technique can be more economical for the overall system. Excavators are highly mobile machines that can traverse a wide variety of terrain. The grapple can be used to stabilize the machine on steep ground to minimize the danger of overturning. Since there is only one worker with the machine, the hazard to other personnel is low. Sideslope and soil type govern the limit to safe operation. The maximum sideslope for using a loader-forwarder is about 25 – 35 %, especially if the sideslope is uniform. For more broken terrain, loader-forwarders can operate on steeper terrain, provided that they can travel and work safely on an acceptable route through the steep ground. Loader-forwarders cannot work safely on thin soils overlaying bedrock because of the danger of sliding. However, the hazard can be reduced by using flotation mats. The sliding hazard is aggravated with snowfall...|$|R
