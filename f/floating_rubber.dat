50|$|The {{building}} sits {{directly above}} the Great Northern Tunnel, which carries the primary rail corridor through the city, and {{adjacent to the}} Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel, which has a station directly integrated into the building. The performance hall is insulated from the rumbles of the traffic in these tunnels and the streets outside the hall by <b>floating</b> on <b>rubber</b> pads which insulate it from the outer shell of the building. These same noise-insulation features would also serve to dampen the destructive effects of any prospective earthquakes.|$|R
50|$|The S A was {{a variant}} design by the IJA {{military}} {{for use as}} a transport/personnel carrier for crossing difficult swampy terrain and water ways. Like the F B, it had <b>rubber</b> <b>floats</b> attached to its track links to prevent it from sinking into the quagmire. It could also be used to transport men across water ways, powered by a drive propeller shaft.|$|R
2500|$|Nivaldo Fernández Ferran, one of {{the three}} {{survivors}} on the boat, said [...] "Elizabeth protected her son to the end". According to Ferran, they set out on their trip at 4a.m., dragging inflated <b>rubber</b> <b>floats,</b> or inner tubes, in case they needed them. As they encountered bad weather, the boat's engine failed and the craft began to fill with water. After it went under, the passengers clung to the inner tubes in cold water, with waves reaching heights of three to four meters (10 to 13 feet).|$|R
5000|$|Sammy Terry is a {{television}} horror host based in Indianapolis, Indiana. The role was originated by Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Carter in 1962, and Carter's son Mark Carter {{took over the}} role from his father in 2010. Bob Carter (1929-2013) was {{a television}} personality who appeared mostly on Indianapolis local television station WTTV, regularly during the 1960s and 1970s, and sporadically through the late 1980s. The format of Carter’s show as Sammy Terry, Nightmare Theater, usually involved the showing of two films. During the commercial breaks, Carter, in character as Sammy Terry (a pun based on the word [...] "cemetery"), would engage in camp banter with the audience and his <b>floating</b> <b>rubber</b> spider, [...] "George". This banter often included some commentary on the films being shown, which included classic films {{as well as many}} less-than-stellar productions common to the horror film era of the 1930s through the early 1960s. Carter died on June 30, 2013.|$|E

500|$|The {{machine was}} a simple, cross-shaped frame, with the pilot {{standing}} on a platform, secured by a safety harness. The harness also secured the aircraft's engine, which was an outboard motor manufactured by Mercury Marine. The engine was controlled by a twist-grip motorcycle-style throttle and transferred power to the [...] diameter, contra-rotating rotors via belt drive with a chain reduction unit. The aircraft's landing gear consisted of airbags {{at the end of}} each arm of the frame along with a large <b>rubber</b> <b>float</b> in the middle, allowing for amphibious capability, although this arrangement was later replaced by a pair of conventional helicopter-type skids.|$|R
5000|$|The F B was an Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) {{military}} transport/personnel carrier {{used for}} crossing difficult swampy terrain. It {{was part of}} the effort by the army to mechanize their forces and its [...] "cross-country capabilities". First produced in 1935, 146 units were made. It had a two-to-three-man crew. The vehicle had eight road wheels per side. The track links had <b>rubber</b> <b>floats</b> attached to them in order to prevent the vehicle from sinking into the quagmire. The F B could also be used to transport men across water ways, powered by a drive propeller shaft.|$|R
5000|$|... "Tuesday {{it was so}} rough, {{and with}} the rain, we had an awful time getting along. We had gunnery drill Tuesday and more fleet {{maneuver}}s. The Macon came out about 1 pm Tues. to maneuver with the fleet and to enter Frisco with us this morning. The Macon {{came out in the}} storm not knowing that she would never get back to land. The Macon circled high above the fleet all the afternoon, and about 6 o'clock, radio messages began coming in that the Macon had had casualties and would have to land. The C.C. of the fleet radioed all ships in company with us to go at full speed for the wreckage. The crew abandoned it as soon as it hit the water, and all were saved except two. There were 83 men in the crew. The wreckage sank within a few minutes after it hit the water. We lingered around the spot where it sank looking for any parts which might be floating around. The search lights on all ships were combing the waters all through the night. The crew to the Macon were <b>floating</b> around in <b>rubber</b> <b>floats</b> and almost froze to death. I had to read about the Akron disaster, but this one I witnessed. The commander Clay had just been transferred to the Macon from this ship. This may contradict with the papers, but this is straight. There was an explosion in the tail and they could not control it." ...|$|R

5000|$|Screen Basket- Also {{known as}} the screen [...] "bed" [...] {{it is the most}} {{important}} part of the machine, it is responsible for transferring the shaking intensity of the machine, measured in [...] "G's", while keeping the [...] "shaking" [...] motion even throughout the entire basket. It must do all that while holding the screens securely in place, eliminating drilled solids bypass to the hopper and allowing for easy operation and maintenance of the machine. Different brands of shakers have different methods of fulfilling these demands by using specialized screen tensioning apparatus, rubber seals around the screens, basket reinforcement to limit flex, <b>rubber</b> <b>Float</b> Mounts rather than springs, rubber Deck seals and selective vibrator placement.|$|R
5000|$|In the night, a Nazi plane appears overhead, {{and they}} get up with their rifles. However there is nothing they can do about it, {{and go back to}} bed. The {{following}} morning, they spot three Nazi pilots <b>floating</b> on a <b>rubber</b> dinghy {{in the middle of the}} nearby lake, clearly having bailed out of the plane the previous night. Requisitioning the Sea Scouts boat, Mainwaring and his men go out to parley with the pilots, using Hodges as an interpreter because of his knowledge of German. Their efforts meet ridicule and the Germans do not surrender, and instead laugh when Hodges falls in the water. It appears the Germans are waiting for nightfall so they can ship ashore, and escape.|$|R
40|$|Solar {{energy is}} one of the {{promising}} renewable energy sources for desalination of saline and brackish waters. The solar evaporation rate could be enhanced by placing light-absorbing agents on the surface or bottom of the solar ponds. So far, different materials such as various dyes, blackened wet jute cloth, black plastic bubble sheets, black <b>rubber,</b> <b>floating</b> porous plates, etc. were used to induce the solar evaporation rate, but the evaporation results showed that the water evaporation enhancement using those materials was quite limited. We have recently reported the use of solar lightabsorbing carbon-Fe 3 O 4 particles and achieved a 230 % increase in solar evaporation rate. This paper focuses on mathematical modeling of the solar evaporation process assisted by this kind of floating light-absorbing material. The proposed model was used to predict the evaporation rate of the experimental tests and results showed an acceptable compatibility between the experimental and calculated evaporation rates by an error lower than 13 %...|$|R
40|$|Pipelines {{transportation}} {{is widely used}} regardless in any industry. Mostly,liquid and gases are sent using the transportation method through a pipe. Turbulent flow in pipeline causes friction drag and pressure drag which results in pressure drop and increases the operational cost by increasing the pumping power losses. Therefore,an effectivepipeline flow is {{needed in order to}} reduce the pressure drop by improving the drag reduction in the pipeline system. This research is executed to improve water flow by using the <b>floating</b> technique. Natural <b>Rubber</b> (cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene) was selected as floating materials by considering its flexible nature and strength. The dimension of the fabricated floating equipment are, 17 stripes of natural rubber (cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene) in length of 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm,width and thickness of 0. 3 cm and 0. 1 cm respectively. The rubber stripes suspended in pipeline by using aluminium made ring. 10 different flow rates of water used to a 1. 5 inch sized pipe. The variables of length are 10 cm, 15 cm and 20 cm. During the experiment,the pressure drop before and after using floating technique was recorded and used to calculate the percentage of drag reduction. The data was analysed further by plotting graphs of percentage of drag reduction versus Reynolds numbers. The floating technique is proven to reduce the pressure drop,pumping power losses and degree of turbulence by increasing the drag reduction in pipeline transportation. A significant reduction of drag in the turbulent flow of water with the fabrication of floating equipment was appraised with pressure drop reduction. The applied floating technique proved to redirect the turbulence flow to laminar flowby correcting the mechanism of turbulent flow. The maximum drag reduction obtained is from 27. 80 % to 26. 18 % which occurs at a pipe length of 1 m by using the floating device with the length of 15 cm and 20 cm. These results were attained for the Reynolds number of 51059. 94 and 64985. 38...|$|R
