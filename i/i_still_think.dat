I've always been convinced that in these moments that supreme player of poker, the Norman , used his craftiness and his fearless bluffing to win his fifth Tour. Because, to me, {{it was clear that}} Anquetil was at the very limit of his strength and that had Poulidor attacked him repeatedly and suddenly then he would have cracked... Although his advisers claim that his error in maintaining steady pressure rather than attacking was the result of using slightly too big a gear, which stopped his jumping away, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that it was in his head that Pou-Pou should have changed gears.|$|E
500|$|The BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who {{has often}} been heavily {{influenced}} by the various Quatermass serials, and despite Kneale's dislike of it ("It sounded a terrible idea and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was," [...] he commented in 1986) and his refusal to write for it, unofficial references to Quatermass {{have appeared in the}} programme and its spinoffs. [...] Serials directly influenced include The Web of Fear, The Invasion, Spearhead from Space, The Ambassadors of Death, Inferno, The Seeds of Doom and Image of the Fendahl, as well as the 2007 [...] "The Lazarus Experiment", which echoes the first serial's climax in Westminster Abbey, with the use of Southwark Cathedral. Former Doctor Who script editor and producer Derrick Sherwin admitted on a DVD documentary that the idea of setting more serials on contemporary Earth in the early 1970s was to recall a Quatermass feel.|$|E

500|$|Lee {{conceptualized}} {{the video}} around {{the lyrics to}} the song: [...] "It's kind of about exposing that it's fake. And the video's more {{along the lines of}} exposing the real behind-the-scenes [...] of some of these people. It's basically showing the glamorous lifestyle and the depressed, selfish misery behind it. [...] It's like beating a dead horse at this point, but at the time Britney Spears was just coming out. But <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's relevant." [...] Joe D'Angelo of MTV News wrote that [...] "fans will get to see Amy Lee like never before. Instead of her homemade wings and signature gothic garb, the clip finds Lee dressed alternately as a wholesome teenager, a kitschy pop idol and a softly lit glamazon." [...] Amy Lee portrays the life of a model who promotes products by a company called [...] "Lies". The music video focuses on the struggles that Lee's character suffers with because of her modeling career and her opposite lifestyle.|$|E
500|$|Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, {{the authors}} of the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, praised the episode, calling it [...] "a great episode because the {{accidents}} that befall the pro players are so funny." [...] Chris Turner, {{the author of the book}} Planet Simpson, said that the episode was the indication that [...] "the Golden Age [...] had arrived." [...] Nate Meyers gave the episode four and a half out of five, stating [...] "the script makes great use of the baseball superstars, giving each of them a strong personality and plenty of pep (the highlight has to be Mattingly's clash with Mr. Burns)." [...] Colin Jacobson disliked the episode: [...] "when [...] originally aired, I didn't like it. While I've warmed up to the show slightly over the last decade, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's generally weak, and I'd definitely pick it as Season Three's worst." ...|$|E
500|$|Kneale {{never saw}} himself as a science-fiction writer, and was often {{critical}} of the genre. He particularly disliked the BBC series Doctor Who (1963–89; 1996; 2005–present), {{for which he had}} once turned down an offer to write. [...] "It sounded a terrible idea and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was," [...] he commented in 1986. [...] "The fact that it's lasted a long time and has a steady audience doesn't mean much. So has Crossroads and that's a stinker". He also slammed Blake's 7, which he described as the lowest point of British television science-fiction: [...] "I think the low point for me would be the very few bits I've seen of a thing called Blake's 7 which I found paralytically awful. The dialogue/characterisation seemed to consist of a kind of childish squabbling" [...] and Doomwatch: [...] "I was approached to write Doomwatch. That didn't seem to be much good either." [...] Doctor Who was heavily influenced by Kneale's Quatermass serials, in some cases even using specific storylines that were very similar to those from Quatermass.|$|E

500|$|Talking further about Scritti Politti, a British post-punk band, Minogue reminisced {{about her}} {{collaboration}} with the band's frontman Green Gartside, who provides vocals on the track [...] "Someday", saying, [...] "To this day I haven't met him! I {{left a message on}} his answering machine, saying, [...] "Hi, it's Kylie! I just wanted to say thanks so much! You sound brilliant!" [...] "After Dark" [...] was co-written by Dennis, who had previously co-written [...] "Can't Get You Out of My Head" [...] for Minogue. Torrini, who co-wrote [...] "Slow", revealed how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into the line of fire with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number.

500|$|Opening in 2,362 theaters on March 2, 2007, {{the film}} grossed US$13.3 {{million in its}} opening weekend, placing second and posting a per-theater average of $5,671. The film was outgrossed by fellow opener Wild Hogs and saw a decline of over 50% in its second weekend, losing out to the record-breaking 300. It grossed $33 million in North America and $51 million {{in the rest of}} the world, {{bringing}} its current total to $84 million, above its estimated $65 million production budget. In an interview with Sight & Sound magazine, Fincher addressed the film's low gross at the North American box office: [...] "Even with the box office being what it is, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> there's an audience out there for this movie. Everyone has a different idea about marketing, but my philosophy is that if you market a movie to 16-year-old boys and don't deliver Saw or Seven, they're going to be the most vociferous ones coming out of the screening saying 'This movie sucks.' And you're saying goodbye to the audience who would get it because they're going to look at the ads and say, 'I don't want to see some slasher movie.'" ...|$|E
500|$|Former {{executives}} at Sega have mixed {{opinions of the}} 32X. [...] Bayless believes firmly that the 32X serves {{as a warning to}} the video game industry not to risk splintering the market for consoles by creating add-ons, and was critical of the Kinect and PlayStation Move for doing so. [...] Franz places the 32X's commercial failure on its inability to function without an attached Genesis and lack of a CD drive, despite its compatibility with the Sega CD, stating, [...] "The 32X was destined to die because it didn't have a CD drive and was an add-on. [...] An add-on device is never as well thought out as a built-from-scratch device." [...] Miller, on the other hand, remembers the 32X positively, stating, [...] "I think the 32X actually was an interesting, viable platform. The timing was wrong, and certainly our ability to stick with it, given what we did with Saturn, was severely limited. There were a whole bunch of reasons why we couldn’t ultimately do what we had to do with that platform, without third party support and with the timing of Saturn, but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> the project was a success for a bunch of other reasons. In hindsight, it was not a great idea for a whole bunch of other reasons." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Slow" [...] {{was written}} by Kylie Minogue, Dan Carey, and Emilíana Torrini, and {{produced}} by Carey, Torrini, and Sunnyroads. In 2009, Torrini explained how she was approached for writing the song, saying [...] "It was like I had just accidentally walked into {{the line of fire}} with, [...] "Hey! You There! It was all quite surreal. <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone". She further said that she [...] "loved the way the song had this push-pull effect; the musical and lyrical combination gives you a sense of that".|$|E
500|$|The Gallagher {{brothers}} hold differing {{opinions about}} the album. As early as July 1997, Noel was [...] "talking down" [...] Be Here Now in the music press, describing the production as [...] "bland", and remarking {{that some of the}} tracks were [...] "fucking shit". Noel is also very keen to downplay the record's commercial success, saying: [...] "Just because you sell lots of records, it doesn't mean to say you're any good. Look at Phil Collins." [...] In Live Forever: The Rise and Fall of Brit Pop, he dismissed the album, and blamed its faults on drugs and the band's indifference during recording. He suggested that the people unsatisfied with the record simply sell it. In contrast, Noel noted that his brother [...] "thinks it fucking rocks." [...] In the same documentary, Liam defended the record, and said that [...] "at that time we thought it was fucking great, and <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it's great. It just wasn't Morning Glory." [...] In 2006, Liam said of Noel, [...] "If he didn't like the record that much, he shouldn't have put the fucking record out in the first place... I don't know what's up with him but it's a top record, man, and I'm proud of it—it's just a little bit long." ...|$|E
500|$|Referring to {{the scene}} in the third season where Ben {{seemingly}} fits Sawyer with a lethal pacemaker, Emerson comments [...] "Sadistic may be the word, but he doesn't seem to take much relish in it. He's just sort of detached, he looks at it coldly. I sometimes feel like everything to him is a sort of scientific experiment and he is interested in a dispassionate way in how the experiment runs its course. I think some day if we ever find out what his parentage is, that his parents were people of science". Elizabeth Mitchell, who plays Juliet, did not think it was a [...] "huge surprise for Juliet that Ben had feelings for , but <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> it was... it was horrifying under the circumstances". She also thought [...] " [...] this kind of wonderful mind, and I think that Ben probably has a tremendous respect for that. It's not because Juliet is so enticing, it's just the fact that she's got this amazing mind, she has this amazing, you know, intelligence, and I think that's what intrigues him, that's what draws him into her". During season four the producers deliberately left it ambiguous as to whether Ben {{was a part of the}} Oceanic 6 (six survivors of the plane crash that make it off the Island) after he appeared in one of Sayid's flashforwards.|$|E

500|$|... "Sparks Fly" [...] {{received}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Swift's vocals on [...] "Sparks Fly", commenting that her voice {{in such an}} upbeat song is unaffected enough to mask how masterful she has become as a singer. Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review considers it [...] "dopamine-infused, hair-whipping stuff". Jonathan Keefe of Slant Magazine calls the song [...] "the purest iteration of Swift’s template and repertoire", also saying that it [...] "could turn things around for Swift, as it’s perhaps the most perfectly constructed single in a career built on tracks that are marvels of pop production and songwriting." [...] He concluded by stating that the song [...] "proves how evocative those turns-of-phrase {{can be in the}} right context. To that end, “Sparks Fly” plays as a template as much as it does as a standalone single, and it’s a testament to everything Taylor Swift gets right." [...] Bobby Peacock of Roughstock claims that he gets [...] "a sense that Taylor is starting to experience a little [...] burnout at radio. Her songs drop like rocks once they peak, and she's currently 0 for 3 on hitting the top of the Billboard charts. While I don't think this song has that je ne sais quoi to get her another 'You Belong with Me'-level [...] hit, <b>I</b> <b>still</b> <b>think</b> that even a slightly lesser effort from her is a worthwhile listen." [...] Blake Boldt of Engine 145 praised Swift, saying [...] "Her infusion of individual lines with urgency (“Drop everything now,” she insists) and earnestness (“Take away the pain,” she pleads) are a tribute to her talent, {{not so much as a}} distinguished vocalist but as an excellent communicator. Each frazzled note is freighted with meaning. Should I stay or should I go now?, she wonders, [...] away the hours before he calls her again." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country claimed the song is [...] "just another one of those so-Swift tracks that continually toes the line between country and pop to create a genre that is 100% Taylor Swift." [...] Erin Thompson of Seattle Weekly stated he wasn't to [...] "hot on" [...] the song and compared the song to Swift's earlier works, [...] "Fearless", [...] "Hey Stephen", and [...] "Forever and Always", and stated that Swift [...] "puts in a line about standing in the rain in so many of her songs that I'm beginning to think she watches The Notebook every time she gets ready to sit down and write a song." [...] Mikael Wood of Spin considered it a bubbly tune along with Swift's song, [...] "Long Live".|$|E
