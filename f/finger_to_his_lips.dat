5|$|For {{the next}} 20 years, Berg {{had no real}} job, living off friends and {{relatives}} who put up with {{him because of his}} charisma. When they would ask what he did for a living, he would reply by putting his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> giving them the impression that he was still a spy. A lifelong bachelor, he lived with his brother Samuel for 17 years. According to Samuel, he became moody and snappish after the war and did not seem to care for much in life besides his books. His brother finally grew fed up with the arrangement and asked Moe to leave and even had eviction papers drawn up. After being evicted from his brother's home, Berg moved in with his sister Ethel in Belleville, New Jersey, where he remained {{for the rest of his}} life.|$|E
2500|$|Mr. America's last WWE {{appearance}} {{was on the}} June 26 episode of SmackDown! when Big Show and The World's Greatest Tag Team (Charlie Haas and Shelton Benjamin) defeated Brock Lesnar, Kurt Angle, and Mr. America in a six-man tag team match. After the show went off the air, Mr. America unmasked to show the fans that he was indeed Hogan, putting his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> telling the fans to keep quiet about his secret. The next week, Hogan quit WWE due to frustration with the creative team. On the July 3 episode of SmackDown!, McMahon showed the footage of Mr. America unmasking as Hogan and [...] "fired" [...] him, although Hogan had already quit in real life. The Mr. America charactercame under fire briefly from Marvel Comics, who anointed it a rip-off of Captain America, citing costume similarity. It was later revealed that Hogan was unhappy with the payoffs for his matches after his comeback under the Mr. America gimmick. McMahon decided to terminate Hogan's contract and Hogan left WWE in 2003.|$|E

6000|$|... "Sh!" [...] he admonished me, a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> He {{advanced}} to my side, {{set down the}} taper on the chair, and seated himself upon {{the edge of my}} bed.|$|E
60|$|I entered, and was {{overwhelmed}} with surprise at finding my friend {{standing in the}} middle of the room accoutred for the road just like myself. He put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|He {{stood for}} a moment looking into her eyes. Then he stooped down and raised her hesitating <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R

60|$|The {{party were}} now near {{where it was}} {{supposed}} a line of sentinels was stationed, and, holding his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> Cummings gave them {{to understand that the}} utmost silence must be preserved.|$|E
60|$|He {{raised her}} <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b> It was not often that they lapsed into sentiment. When she spoke again it was finished.|$|R

60|$|His manner changed; the saintliness {{vanished}} from his attitude; {{the expression of}} his face became sly and knowing. He came nearer to Charity, took hold of her wrist, whilst he raised one <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|The craft lay at her {{moorings}} with uncovered hatch. Raising his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips</b> {{and then}} tapping his sword {{in a significant}} manner, the youth crept noiselessly toward the vessel. I was close at his heels.|$|E
60|$|Du Lhut put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> {{and then}} in an instant was down again upon {{his face with his}} ear fixed to the ground. He sprang up with the look {{of a man who has}} heard what he {{expected}} to hear.|$|E

60|$|He bowed again; {{and again}} he bore her <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> what time she curtsied. Thereupon, {{with no more than}} this formal {{breaking}} of the ice, they parted.|$|R
60|$|Wulf drank off the {{contents}} of the goblet placed to his lips, and in a few minutes was fast asleep. When he woke it was broad daylight, and Beorn was sitting by his side. The latter put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
60|$|I nodded. For {{a moment}} {{he looked at the}} face of Polly Ann, {{sleeping}} peacefully, and the fierce light faded from his eyes. He brushed her on the cheek and she awoke and smiled at him, trustfully, lovingly. He put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E

6000|$|... "We only seem to {{last long}} enough to make love {{thoroughly}} to half a dozen pretty women in a lifetime," [...] replied M. le Contr√¥leur, as he gallantly raised her <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|R
60|$|Major Tempe put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> {{to enforce}} the {{necessity}} for silence, and made signs to him to open the window.

60|$|The uncle, sunk in his chair, snored a little; {{the canary}} {{answered}} with a shrill lullaby. Pyecroft picked up the duster, threw it over the cage, put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> and we tiptoed out into the shop, while Leggatt brought the car round.|$|E
6000|$|He put his <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>lips,</b> nodded, {{and peered}} round. [...] "Lollipops for Sannie," [...] he whispered low, at last, with a guilty smile.
