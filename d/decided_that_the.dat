5|$|Nevertheless, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battalion's key positions, {{including}} its officers, non commissioned officers (NCOs) and signallers, would initially be filled largely by New Zealanders of European descent. This decision {{was met with}} some consternation, so assurances were made that over time suitable Māori candidates would take over these positions. In this regard, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> battalion's first commanding officer would be a regular officer, Major George Dittmer—later promoted to lieutenant colonel in January 1940—and that his second-in-command would be a Reserve officer, Lieutenant Colonel George Bertrand, a part-Māori who would take up the position with the rank of major. Both men were veterans of the First World War and had considerable experience.|$|E
5|$|On {{a council}} held in Constantinople on the {{relations}} with Bulgaria it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> two countries should begin negotiations despite {{the calls for}} punishing the Bulgarians for the invasion. Michael Shishman divorced his wife Anna Neda and married Theodora Palaiologina, the 35-year-old widow of emperor Theodore Svetoslav. The exact reasons for that act are unclear. Many historians suggest that {{the deterioration of the}} Bulgarian-Serbian relations was rooted in the Serbian penetration in Macedonia. The marriage cemented the peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire but the need for an ally against the Serbs made Michael Shishman prone to make concessions. It was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> border should follow the Philippopolis-Chernomen-Sozopol line. The agreement was finally signed in the autumn of 1324 and Michael Shishman spent the next several years at peace with his neighbors.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods of}} {{insertion}} were considered, {{both for the}} paras and the special forces personnel, including an overland approach using four-wheel drive vehicles, and a water-borne insertion using the same method by which the SAS observation teams had arrived at their position. The planning group <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overland approach would not allow troops to enter the village undetected, {{largely due to the}} West Side Boys' roadblocks on the road into the village, and that insertion from Rokel Creek was not feasible for large numbers of troops due to the sandbanks and powerful currents in the river. Thus, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> insertions would be made from three Royal Air Force Chinook helicopters from No. 7 Squadron, which had been in Sierra Leone since the beginning of Operation Palliser.|$|E

5|$|After some time, they <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best {{method of}} {{featuring}} a vacuum bag {{was to have}} a cleaning lady vacuuming up the evidence. Whereas cleaning ladies had already been the murder victims of several previous episodes, here it seemed absolutely necessary if they wanted an episode to have a realistic plot. However, the writers believed that having a maid as the victim required a main character to work with in order to give some personal involvement. Monk was not considered mostly because he does not have a cleaning lady, and if he did, she would never be good enough for him because of his germophobia and meticulousness. It was eventually <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> maid would be Dr. Kroger's employee. The idea of having her work for Dr. Kroger was successful, because the writers had been looking to have an episode where Kamel would be the focus.|$|E
5|$|After the {{governor}} and his department <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state could do without the $3.8million (1978USD) that the toll would produce each year, a bill permitting the state {{to take over the}} Loop Parkway was passed on March31, 1978. The removal of the tolls helped Governor Carey gain enough support to pass that year's state budget. The decision to eliminate the Loop Parkway tolls was influenced by Long Beach Supervisor Hannah Komanoff, who also unsuccessfully fought to have the tollbooth on the Atlantic Beach Bridge removed in 1979.|$|E

This breakdown led to an uncertain future of KeSPA's legal ability to broadcast Blizzard's intellectual property of both StarCraft and StarCraft II without paying royalties. MBC Television agreed to Blizzard's new terms in June 2010; KeSPA received a license from Blizzard and Ongamenet will host StarCraft II competitions starting in the summer of 2012.|$|E
5|$|Although {{multiple}} {{funding sources}} were originally {{considered by the}} NEDA to fund the airport's construction, it was <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> project should avail of an official development assistance facility offered by the Japanese government through the then-newly formed Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC). After almost two years of negotiations, and after initially refusing to bankroll the project, the JBIC extended a 6.2 billion peso (US$152million) loan to the Philippine government in August 2000.|$|E

Subsequent problems in Arnhem forced Hicks to change the divisional plan. Only the 2nd Parachute Battalion had reached the road bridge as strong German defences had stopped the other battalions. Hicks <b>decided</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment and 11 Para would link up with the 1st Parachute Brigade {{in an attempt to}} reach their objective.|$|E

5|$|At {{one point}} it was {{considered}} that the two former Line E stations and tunnels {{should be used for}} Line F since the line's southern terminus would be there and that part of the route would be roughly similar to the old Line E.
