5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system in the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area, including a downtown subway under 3rd Avenue with a station between Cherry and James streets. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970. The failure of the <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> ballot measures {{led to the creation}} of Metro Transit in 1972, operating bus service across King County.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s, the <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> Committee {{put forward a}} ballot measure to fund a rapid transit system for the Seattle {{metropolitan}} area. One of the key components of the system was a downtown subway tunnel on 3rd Avenue terminating at Union Station, where it would split into a south branch to serve Georgetown and Renton, and an east branch to serve Bellevue. The ballot measure, requiring a supermajority to support bonding to augment $385 million in local funding with $765 million from the Urban Mass Transportation Administration, failed to reach the 60 percent threshold in 1968 and again during a second vote in 1970.

5|$|Player {{controls}} include clockwise and counterclockwise rotation, <b>forward</b> <b>thrust,</b> firing torpedoes, and hyperspace. Initially {{these were}} controlled using the front-panel test {{switches on the}} PDP-1 minicomputer, with four switches for each player, but these proved to be awkward to use and wore out quickly under normal gameplay, as well as causing players to accidentally flip the computer's control and power switches. The location of the switches also left one player {{off to one side}} of the CRT display due to the limited space in front of the computer, which left them at a disadvantage. To alleviate these problems, Kotok and Saunders created a detached control device, essentially an early gamepad. The gamepad had a switch for turning left or right, another for <b>forward</b> <b>thrust</b> or hyperspace, and a torpedo launch button. The button was silent so that the opposing player would not have a warning that the player was attempting to fire a torpedo during a cooldown period.|$|E
40|$|Analogue {{modelling}} experiments using {{brittle materials}} are performed {{to study the}} inversion of extensional structures. Asymmetric grabens of two different orientations are first created during a phase of extension and progressively filled. They are subsequently shortened in the same direction. The aim of our experiments is to determine factors affecting the style of deformation during inversion. We specifically investigate variations in thickness and distribution of strong and weak layers constituting the graben fill and in initial basin orientation. The main advantage of our experimental set-up {{is that we have}} a complete control on graben location, width, infill and orientation before inversion. The experiments show that shortening results only in limited reactivation of pre-existing normal faults. In general, <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts</b> and backthrusts cut across normal faults into the footwall of the graben. The <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts</b> either propagate parallel to the enveloping surface of faulted blocks or they cut across basin-limiting normal faults at various angles. The graben fill is mechanically extruded by displacement along <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts</b> that accommodate most of the shortening. Both pre-existing faults and weak graben fill act as zones of weakness during inversion and determine the orientation and location of both backthrusts and <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts.</b> The results of our experiments conform well to natural examples of inverted graben structures...|$|R
5000|$|The F.140 Super Goliath flew for {{the first}} time in April 1924. It was {{followed}} in 1930 by the F.141, a modernised version with a nose with a [...] "balcony", a <b>forward</b> <b>thrusting</b> overhanging structure for a gun emplacement. This increased the length by 1.17 m (3 ft 10 in).|$|R
50|$|At {{this point}} the College Council’s ambitions and those of their {{architect}} were becoming clear. On their high site the buildings are very visible. The council had insisted on raising the architect’s four-storeyed tower to five storeys. The three storeyed ranges and the <b>forward</b> <b>thrusting</b> subordinate reaches present a complex, but legible and imposing face to the world.|$|R
5|$|After the 1962 World's Fair and {{introduction}} of the Seattle Center Monorail, a proposal was drawn up by fair organizers to extend the system to the airport. The plan, supported by Governor Albert D. Rosellini, was ultimately rejected by incoming Governor Daniel J. Evans in favor of completing Interstate 5. The <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> rapid transit plan, which was rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included Sea-Tac Airport in its long-term plans for service; the airport was excluded from the first phase because of possible changes brought by airport expansion and the Supersonic Transport program.|$|E
5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing roll. The left engines remained in <b>forward</b> <b>thrust,</b> while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Sound Transit {{plans to}} run a bus rapid transit line on SR522 from NE 145th Street to the University of Washington Bothell campus {{as part of its}} Sound Transit 3 program, {{approved}} in 2016. The line is scheduled to begin service in 2024 and will terminate at the NE 145th Street light rail station in Shoreline. The corridor has also been proposed for forms of rail transit since the mid-20th century, including the failed <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> ballot measures of 1968 and 1970, the Seattle Monorail Project, and light rail in the Sound Transit long-range plan.|$|E

5|$|The Broadway {{business}} district on Capitol Hill was developed between 1900 and 1930, along new city streetcar lines connecting Downtown Seattle to the University District. Urban planner Virgil Bogue's rejected 1911 comprehensive plan for Seattle envisioned a citywide subway system, including an underground loop on Capitol Hill and Broadway that would connect with an east–west line on Pike Street. The <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> Committee's planned regional rapid transit system, rejected by voters in 1968 and 1970, included a {{station at the}} intersection of Broadway, Union Street, and Madison Street, as well as additional stations in eastern Capitol Hill.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> plan of {{the late}} 1960s {{proposed}} building a four-line rapid transit network using $385 million in local funding to augment a larger federal contribution. One of the proposed lines, traveling between Downtown Seattle and Lake City, included a station adjacent to Roosevelt High School at Brooklyn Avenue NE and NE 65th Street. The plan was put before voters on two occasions, in February 1968 and May 1970, and failed to gain the needed supermajority to pass.|$|E
5|$|The {{propellers}} of a DC-6 {{are designed}} to provide reverse thrust after the aircraft touches down. The pilot then retards the throttle levers to a point below idle speed and that directs the electric mechanisms in the propeller hub to rotate the blades to a position in which they will provide reverse thrust. Should the pilot need to perform a go-around, he moves the thrust levers forward to a positive position again and that will produce <b>forward</b> <b>thrust,</b> enabling the pilot to execute a go-around maneuver.|$|E

2500|$|In the Grand Final, Swift {{was again}} {{best on the}} ground, playing at full-back against Hawthorn's John Peck, and as the team's captain in Richmond’s only ever Night Premiership victory: [...] "Swift played a superb game at full-back {{repelling}} Hawthorn’s <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts</b> and marking everything that came his way" [...] (Hogan, 1996, p.300) and, according to the press, [...] "his superb defensive play, in that game, was the difference between victory and defeat" [...] (Hogan, 1996, p.224). Richmond 8.16 (64) defeated Hawthorn 9.6 (60).|$|R
5000|$|Chiyotaikai was {{somewhat}} above average in size (1.81 m/158 kg), but was nonetheless a very agile fighter who preferred quick decisions by oshi-sumo. He was known mostly for his explosive charge {{at the beginning}} of his matches (the tachi-ai) and his trademark barrage of <b>forward</b> <b>thrusting</b> hand-slaps (tsuppari). Indeed, he was so famous for them that he was sometimes criticized by sumo fans for being a [...] "one-trick pony." [...] If Chiyotaikai's opponents managed to grab hold of his mawashi, he usually lost the match.|$|R
5|$|In 2014, Boeing {{conceptualized}} an Apache upgrade {{prior to}} the introduction of the U.S. Army's anticipated attack version of the Future Vertical Lift aircraft, forecast to replace the Apache by 2040. The conceptual AH-64F would have greater speed via a new 3,000 shp turboshaft engine from the improved turbine engine program, retractable landing gear, stub wings to offload lift from the main rotor during cruise, and a tail rotor that can articulate 90 degrees to provide <b>forward</b> <b>thrust.</b> In October 2016, the Army revealed they would not pursue another Apache upgrade to focus on funding the FVL; the Army will continue buying the Apache through the 2020s until Boeing's production line ends in 2026, then FVL is slated to come online in 2030.|$|E
5|$|The CAB {{carried out}} flight tests using a DC-6. They {{found that if}} the {{propellers}} were reversed prior to take-off they would not, if the flag was not raised, be rotated automatically again {{in the air to}} produce <b>forward</b> <b>thrust</b> if full power was applied. Tests performed by United Airlines showed that, if the propellers of just one engine were reversed and full power was applied to all four engines, then the aircraft would spiral into a dive. If METO (maximum except take-off) power was applied to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines, and full reverse thrust was applied to engine No. 4, then the aircraft would become uncontrollable.|$|E
5|$|Fighting enemies, {{which appear}} {{in both the}} overworld and dungeons, relies on Link's use of his sword and shield. Link's sword {{movements}} are mapped to the direction the Wii Remote is flicked by the player, and other moves include a <b>forward</b> <b>thrust</b> and a stab. Enemy movements are designed to anticipate and block Link's combat movements. By raising the Wii Remote, the sword gathers energy which can be unleashed in a Skyward Strike. Skyward Strikes are also used to trigger environmental elements such as magical switches. The shield is controlled with the Nunchuck: when the shield is raised, {{it can be used}} to reflect attacks. Spin attacks and Finishing Blows are activated by swinging both the Wii Remote and Nunchuck. Link's health is represented with Hearts, with Link taking damage whenever he is hit: if he loses all Hearts, the game ends.|$|E
50|$|The {{introduction}} of jump take-off was another major improvement in capability. The rotor was accelerated in no-lift pitch until the rotor speed required for flight was achieved, and then declutched. The loss of torque caused the blades to swing forward on angled drag hinges with a resultant increase in collective pitch, causing the aircraft to {{leap into the}} air. With all the engine power now applied to the <b>forward</b> <b>thrusting</b> propeller, it was now possible to continue in forward flight with the rotor in autorotation.|$|R

25|$|When swimming, {{the waves}} become larger {{as they move}} down the snake's body, and the wave travels {{backwards}} faster than the snake moves <b>forwards.</b> <b>Thrust</b> is generated by pushing their body against the water, resulting in the observed slip. In spite of overall similarities, {{studies show that the}} pattern of muscle activation is different in aquatic versus terrestrial lateral undulation, which justifies calling them separate modes. All snakes can laterally undulate forward (with backward-moving waves), but only sea snakes have been observed reversing the motion (moving backwards with forward-moving waves).|$|R
5|$|Non-disabled sprinters have {{calves and}} ankles that return and amplify the energy {{supplied}} by their hips and knees, while Pistorius compensates with additional work {{because he does}} not have calves and ankles with their associated tendons and muscles. An analysis published by Engineering & Technology magazine estimates that in using the blades, Pistorius must generate twice the power from his gluteal and quadriceps muscles that a normal sprinter would. Other sources also credit core abdominal muscles and a faster arm swing. His trainer estimates that about 85 percent of his power comes from his hips and the rest from his knees. This results in a gait that waddles slightly, as Pistorius swings his upper body to balance the springing action of the blades. The blades compress under his weight, then release as he moves forward, providing <b>forward</b> <b>thrust</b> from the tips as they return to their molded shape. As they spring off, he swings them slightly out to the side and throws them forward for the next stride.|$|E
5|$|The design {{report for}} the Bay Freeway project was {{published}} on February 10, 1970, and was subsequently distributed to the project. The report featured a new design for the freeway, including ramps to a parking garage serving the domed stadium and aesthetic standards meant to complement the existing Seattle Center. Five additional public hearings were held by the Seattle City Council in 1970, as support for the R.H. Thomson Expressway and other proposed freeways were the subject of highway revolts {{similar to those in}} other American cities. During the April hearing, former State Department of Highways director Charles Prahl spoke out against the Bay Freeway and predicted that it would cause traffic to back up onto I-5 during rush hour. Voters rejected a <b>Forward</b> <b>Thrust</b> initiative that would have built the proposed domed stadium at the Seattle Center on May 19, removing {{one of the main reasons}} to build the freeway and forcing the city council to consider scaling down the proposal. The June hearing resulted in the removal of the R.H. Thomson Freeway from the comprehensive plan as well as the widening of the Bay Freeway to six lanes to support an expected 2,610 drivers during rush hour.|$|E
5|$|Although most {{researchers}} now consider Heterodontosaurus a bipedal runner, some earlier studies proposed a partial or fully quadrupedal locomotion. In 1980, Santa Luca described several {{features of the}} forelimb that are also present in recent quadrupedal animals and imply a strong arm musculature: these include a large olecranon (a bony eminence forming the uppermost part of the ulna), enlarging the lever arm of the forearm. The medial epicondyle of the humerus was enlarged, providing attachment sites for strong flexor muscles of the forearm. Furthermore, projections on the claws might have increased the <b>forward</b> <b>thrust</b> of the hand during walking. According to Santa Luca, Heterodontosaurus was quadrupedal when moving slowly but was able {{to switch to a}} much faster, bipedal run. Polish palaeontologists Teresa Maryańska and Halszka Osmólska supported Santa Luca's hypothesis in 1985; furthermore, they noted that the dorsal spine was strongly flexed downwards in the most completely known specimen. In 1987, Gregory S. Paul suggested that Heterodontosaurus might have been obligatorily quadrupedal, and that these animals would have galloped for fast locomotion. David Weishampel and Lawrence Witmer in 1990 as well as Norman and colleagues in 2004 argued in favour of exclusively bipedal locomotion, based on the morphology of the claws and shoulder girdle. The anatomical evidence suggested by Santa Luca was identified as adaptations for foraging; the robust and strong arms might have been used for digging up roots and breaking open insect nests.|$|E
50|$|Houlihan is {{a highly}} skilled player and has been {{extremely}} versatile, able to play a variety of positions. Early in 2002, while continuing to play as a forward, an electrifying three goals in a quarter got Carlton back into the Round 8 match against Hawthorn. Toward the end of 2002, Houlihan began to play-off the half-back line, where his skill and run were used to set up <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts.</b> He {{played an important role}} off half back in the Round 21 victory against the Bulldogs, with 23 possessions and set up the winning goal.|$|R
50|$|The curved knee (also {{sometimes}} called a side knee or roundhouse knee) {{is similar to}} the front knee except that it does not use a <b>forward</b> <b>thrusting</b> motion, but is instead rotated from the outside. Whereas the front knee needs some space in between the combatants to be performed, the curved knee can be executed from a minimal distance, such as in a close clinch. This technique is often employed when an opponent is attempting to protect from a straight knee. Typical targets include floating ribs, hips, and the side of the abdomen.|$|R

50|$|Lloyd {{kicked the}} next two goals, for a {{personal}} match tally of five, to regain the lead for Essendon by less than a goal. Carlton scored {{the next two}} goals after that - the first to Hamill, the second to Whitnall from outside 50m, and in both cases assisted by Hogg - to regain the lead by 8 points early in time-on. Essendon attacked hard, but its <b>forward</b> <b>thrusts</b> were repeatedly repelled by Carlton's defence, including Koutoufides, who had dropped back. With 2:18 remaining on the timekeepers' clock, Mark Johnson kicked a goal for Essendon, to narrow the margin to two points.|$|R
