500|$|During {{his playing}} career, Rivera was {{regarded}} as a team leader within the Yankees organization, often mentoring younger pitchers and counseling teammates. He had a team-first mindset and deferred most discussions about individual accolades to team goals and his teammates, praising them for making his presence in games possible. When once asked to describe his job, Rivera put it simply, [...] "I get the ball, I throw the ball, and then <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> shower." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{military}} {{dangers in}} such an enterprise were numerous: Marlborough's lines of communication along the Rhine would be hopelessly exposed to French interference, for Louis' generals controlled the left {{bank of the river}} and its central reaches. Such a long march would almost certainly involve a high wastage of men and horses through exhaustion and disease. However, Marlborough was convinced of the urgency – [...] "I am very sensible that <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> great deal upon me", he had earlier written to Godolphin, [...] "but should I act otherwise, the Empire would be undone ..." ...|$|E
500|$|Calvin's friends {{urged him}} to marry. Calvin took a prosaic view, writing to one correspondent:I, who have the air of being so hostile to celibacy, I am still not married and {{do not know whether}} I will ever be. If <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> wife it will be because, being better freed from {{numerous}} worries, I can devote myself to the Lord. Several candidates were presented to him including one young woman from a noble family. Reluctantly, Calvin agreed to the marriage, on the condition that she would learn French. Although a wedding date was planned for March 1540, he remained reluctant and the wedding never took place. He later wrote that he would never think of marrying her, [...] "unless the Lord had entirely bereft me of my wits". Instead, in August of that year, he married Idelette de Bure, a widow who had two children from her first marriage.|$|E

500|$|While {{releasing}} {{her third}} studio album Artpop, Gaga held a private event in New York known as ArtRave, where she performed {{songs from the}} album and showcased art pieces. Later, she took the concept of ArtRave and created ArtRave: The Artpop Ball tour. After abruptly cancelling the North American leg of her previous Born This Way Ball (2012–13) tour due to a major hip injury, the tour began with its first leg in the United States on May 4, 2014, in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ArtRave: The Artpop Ball had the singer visiting cities where she canceled tour dates in order to undergo the surgery, as well as playing new cities. Gaga explained to The Independent: [...] "When I'm onstage with the Artpop Ball, {{the point of the}} show is to take what was the mess of my life and make art of it – to raise the spirit of artistic dreams and creativity and take all the things I was feeling in pain about, and rage... <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> much more meditative approach to the performance. I've got wide-open ears. The ArtRave has routines, and there's a performance-art aspect that has been designed." [...] Prior {{to the beginning of the}} tour, Gaga headlined six shows (March 28, 30, 31 and April 2, 4, and 6) at the Roseland Ballroom in Manhattan, New York, and these shows were the final performances at the venue. A seventh show was also added for April 7 and officially closed the venue.|$|E
500|$|When the {{production}} company {{first arrived in}} Los Angeles, {{the cast and crew}} were [...] "intimidated" [...] by Scientologists. Scientology officials had previously visited the New York City production in the midst of rehearsals and handed out [...] "documentation of court cases where the Church of Scientology had successfully prosecuted those seeking to disparage the Church's methods." [...] Director/creator Alex Timbers characterized these events as [...] "terrifically wonderful and intimidating". Editors from the Los Angeles Times received phone calls from Scientologists urging them not to write about the play. [...] In addition, the parents of one of the children from the cast received phone calls from members of the entertainment industry who were Scientologists. The parents of these cast members were told that if their children performed in the play, [...] "it might be bad for their future career." [...] The parents politely informed these callers [...] "We read the script, and we don't think it is mean-spirited ... We understand your concerns, but we don't share your concerns." [...] When asked by Variety magazine for the Church's official take on the play, a Los Angeles Church of Scientology spokeswoman was quoted as saying: [...] "This is not litigation material. This is nothing." [...] In a 2007 interview, Jarrow commented on the Church of Scientology's history of responses to productions of the play: [...] "It's clear the Church doesn't like the show—but in my opinion that kind of controversy is evidence that the show's hitting a nerve and dealing with pertinent issues. So <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> certain pride in that." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1970 she {{proposed}} a similar idea {{to the same}} gallery that was also refused. The piece was untitled. Abramović would {{stand in front of}} the public dressed in her regular clothing. Present on the side of the stage was a clothes rack adorned with clothing that her mother wanted her to wear. She would take the clothing one by one and change into them, then stand to face the public for a while. [...] "From the right pocket of my skirt <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> gun. From the left pocket of my skirt <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> bullet. I put the bullet into the chamber and turn it. I place the gun to my temple. I pull the trigger." [...] The performance had two possible outcomes.|$|E

2500|$|The lyrics tell of the singer's troubled {{past with}} his love, Irene, and express his sadness and frustration.

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Guardian in November 2006, David acknowledged that owning two homes {{on opposite sides of}} the country and flying in a private jet several times per year is at odds with her message to others.

But the truth is, I'm not perfect. This is not about perfection. I don't expect anybody else to be perfect either.

2500|$|Garcia was well-noted for his [...] "soulful {{extended}} guitar improvisations", {{which would}} frequently feature interplay {{between him and}} his fellow band members. His fame, as well as the band's, arguably rested on their ability to never play a song the same way twice. Often, Garcia would take cues from rhythm guitarist Bob Weir, remarking that [...] "there are some [...] kinds of ideas that would really throw me if I had to create a harmonic bridge between all the things going on rhythmically with two drums and Phil [...] innovative bass playing. Weir's ability to solve that sort of problem is extraordinary. [...] Harmonically, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> lot of my solo cues from Bob." ...|$|E

2500|$|When it began, eHarmony did {{not offer}} {{same-sex}} matches; it now offers them through a separate service, Compatible Partners. Warren [...] {{said that he had}} done extensive research on heterosexual marriage but did not know enough about homosexual relationships to do same-sex match-making, which he said [...] "calls for some very careful thinking. Very careful research." [...] He also said that eHarmony promotes heterosexual marriage, adding that (at the time) same-sex marriage was illegal in most places, saying [...] "We don't really want to participate in something that's illegal." [...] In another interview, Warren went into more detail on his own views, noting that [...] "cities like San Francisco, Chicago or New York... they could shut [...] down so fast.

2500|$|Because of Fitzpatrick's {{desire for}} the {{photograph}} to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed [...] "F" [...] on the shoulder.

[...] At this time Fitzpatrick said that [...] "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine." [...] In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that [...] "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." [...] Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.|$|E
2500|$|One of the Empress Farah's main {{initiatives}} was founding Pahlavi University, {{which was}} meant to improve the education of Iranian women, {{and was the first}} American style university in Iran; before then, Iranian universities had always been modeled on the French style. The Empress wrote in 1978 that her duties were: [...] "I could not write in detail of all the organizations over which I preside and in which <b>I</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> very active part, in the realms of education, health, culture and social matters. It would need a further book. A simple list would perhaps give some idea: the Organization for Family Well Being-nurseries for the children of working mothers, teaching women and girls to read, professional training, family planning; the Organization for Blood Transfusion; the Organization for the Fight Against Cancer; the Organization for Help to the Needy, the Health Organization...the Children's Centre; the Centre for the Intellectual Development of Children...the Imperial Institute of Philosophy; the Foundation for Iranian Culture; the Festival of Shiraz, the Tehran Cinema Festival; the Iranian Folklore Organization; the Asiatic Institute; the Civilisations Discussion Centre; the Pahlavi University; the Academy of Sciences." [...] Farah worked long hours at her charitable activities, from about 9 am to 9 pm every weekday. [...] Eventually, the Queen came to preside over a staff of 40 who handled various requests for assistance on a range of issues. She {{became one of the most}} highly visible figures in the Imperial Government and the patron of 24 educational, health and cultural organizations. Her humanitarian role earned her immense popularity for a time, particularly in the early 1970s. During this period, she travelled a great deal within Iran, visiting some of the more remote parts of the country and meeting with the local citizens.|$|E
