25|$|High-voltage TEMs require ultra-high vacuums on {{the range}} of 10−7 to 10−9 Pa to prevent the {{generation}} of an electrical arc, particularly at the TEM cathode. As such for higher voltage TEMs a third vacuum system may operate, with the gun isolated from the main chamber either by <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> or a differential pumping aperture – a small hole that prevents the diffusion of gas molecules into the higher vacuum gun area faster than they can be pumped out. For these very low pressures, either an ion pump or a getter material is used.|$|E

5000|$|A gate valve, {{also known}} as a sluice valve, is a valve which opens by lifting a round or {{rectangular}} gate/wedge out of the path of the fluid. The distinct feature of a gate valve is the sealing surfaces between the gate and seats are planar, so <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used when a straight-line flow of fluid and minimum restriction is desired. The gate faces can be parallel, but are most commonly wedge-shaped. <b>Gate</b> <b>valves</b> are primarily used to permit or prevent the flow of liquids, but typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> shouldn't be used for regulating flow, unless they are specifically designed for that purpose. Because of their ability to cut through liquids, <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are often used in the petroleum industry. For extremely thick fluids, a specialty valve often known as a knife gate valve is used to cut through the liquid. [...] On opening the gate valve, the flow path is enlarged in a highly nonlinear manner with respect to percent of opening. This means that flow rate does not change evenly with stem travel. Also, a partially open gate tends to vibrate from the fluid flow. Most of the flow change occurs near shutoff with a relatively high fluid velocity causing gate and seat wear and eventual leakage if used to regulate flow. Typical <b>gate</b> <b>valves</b> are designed to be fully opened or closed. [...] When fully open, the typical gate valve has no obstruction in the flow path, resulting in very low friction loss.|$|E

Depending on the accuracy, cost consideration, and available space, the flowmeter selected could be an insertion type or fixed type such as orifices or venturi meters. Insertion flow sensors or flowmeters are mostly preferred for use in existing buildings because of their ease of installation, removal and reinstallation. Two types of commercially available insertion type flowmeters, series 225 B and SDI- 000125, both from Data Industrial[TR], were tested at different angles of orientation (0 ?, 45 ?, and 90 ?) and at different locations downstream of a 4 -inch <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> in straight sections of PVC pipe with flow rates between 80 gpm (2 ft/s) and 320 gpm (8 ft/s). The measured flow rates were compared to the flow rates obtained with a standard orifice meter. The effects of the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> on the accuracy of each flowmeter were investigated. A baseline test was conducted with no <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> upstream of meter 1 (series 225 B). Results from this test showed that the presence of the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> distorts flow meter readings. Measured flow rates were decreased with meter orientations of 0 ?, 45 ?, and 90 ? when the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> was present, indicating that the <b>gate</b> <b>valve</b> partially blocks the flow in the upper region of the pipe. Accuracy increases as the flow meter is moved to locations further downstream. Performances of both flowmeters have been compared and contrasted...|$|R

40|$|When a {{high-speed}} railway train enters a tunne 1, a comparession wave is generated {{ahead of the}} train and propagates along the tunnel.
